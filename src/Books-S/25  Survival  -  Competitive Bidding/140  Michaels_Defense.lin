Although knowledge of conventions is helpful,
one does not need to know all about those
conventions which the partnership doesn't employ.   
    However, it is crucial to have partnership understandings    
with respect to combating them.

|ht|p|fp||at|^tMarty Bergen
}^-|fp||cs||cp||ht|s|at|^B@2The defense against Two-Suited Overcalls outlined by Marty Bergen probably is the easiest to learn. Therefore, this section is based mainly on Marty Bergen's ^*IBetter Bidding With Bergen Volume II^*N : |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.martybergen.com^*N|CP||AT|. However, in preparing this section we also have borrowed from Mr. Roth's teaching - they are very similar.

^-|FP||ht|d|cp||cs||AT|^B@2The defense against Michaels cuebids is very similar to defending against UNT particularly when both suits are known. However, there may be confusion when one of the two suits promised by the overcaller is unknown (1@H-2@H and 1@S-2@S). The good news, however, is that Opener's partner-in most instances-can bid at the 2 level-a lower level than when UNT is the overcall bid. |

First, let us look at the defense guideline for when both implied suits by the overcaller are known such as in 1@C-2@C and 1@D-2@D-(hearts and spades in both cases). The defense is similar to when the overcall is an UNT. You will see the description of the bids in the alert section. There would be no hands.|

As you have noticed the guideline is the same. Next we will look at bidding sequence after a Michaels cuebid when only one of the two suits implied is known-1@S-2@S and 1@H-2@H,|
