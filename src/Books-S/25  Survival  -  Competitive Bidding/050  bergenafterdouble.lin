This short synopsis is based on "Raises in Competition" lesson by ^*BHoward Schutzman^*N, (BBO nickname hondo717"). The link to the original lesson is |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/3w6z9w^*N|CP||AT|.

As part of the Survival Kit group this is a stripped down version. It is what you need in a pinch. However, you probably would like to review Howard's lesson in its entirety. Also, it is suggested that you carefully study "Bergen Raises" from this at |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/kks19w^*N|CP||AT| before reviewing this short synopsis.

In this synopsis, unless clearly indicated consider the information as told by Howard. To start the presentation please click forward arrow.

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Many experts play Bergen Raises are off after competition. But I think you can and should play they are on, although that is not standard. Let us refresh your memory about Bergen Raises.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

Bergen Raises come in two flavors:
^*BRegular Bergen Raises^*N, and
^*BReverse Bergen Raises^*N|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|

The main structure for ^*BRegular Bergen Raises^*N is:|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|
A - with 5-6 Dummy Points/4-card support, responder jumps to 3 of the major, |
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|
B - with 7-9 Dummy Points/4-card support, responder bids 3@C (known as a "constructive raise"), |
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


AT|
C - with 10-12 Dummy Points/4-card support, responder bids 3@D (known as a "Limit Raise"), |
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


AT|
D - with 13 Dummy Points or more/4-card support, responder bids 2N or Splinter (the usual Jacoby 2N raise played by many partnerships).|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT|

The B and C are reversed in ^*BReverse Bergen Raises^*N. Therefore, if you play Reverse Bergen Raises 3@C is 10+/4-card support, and 3@D is 7-9 with 4 card support. BTW, Howard plays Reverse Bergen Raises.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


AT|

All these bids are alertable. Before you start the examples please note that when playing Bergen Raise, your response, with appropriate hand of course, ignores the takeout double. The examples will illustrate how to respond using both regular and reverse Bergen Raises after the RHO doubles.|

^b@22@H is the correct bid even if you are playing Bergen Raises. You ignore the double. It is the same bid as in the constructive bidding.|

^b@2Bid 2N. If you play Bergen Raises after a takeout double, that frees up 2N to show a 3-card raise. Any time you can differentiate between a 3 and 4 card limit raise, that is good. That is what I prefer but you have to agree with your partner.|
