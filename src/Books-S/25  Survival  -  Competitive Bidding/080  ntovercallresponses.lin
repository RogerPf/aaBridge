^*BDirect 1N Overcall^*N:
Requires 15-18 HCP—a little more than 1N open—and stoppers for the opener's suit(s). In ^*Bbalancing NT^*N seat, the typical range is 11-14 (some play 10-13 or 10-14). To respond to both, many partnerships use ^*BSystem on - Double Stolen Bid^*N which what we address here. Other approaches are outside the scope of this short presentation. First a few simple observations.|PG||AT|

Opening notrump bids put the partnership in very familiar territory. Responder has an accurate picture of opener’s strength and distribution, making it easy to decide both HOW HIGH and WHERE the partnership belongs. Responder also has tools such as Stayman, Jacoby transfer to majors, and transfer to minors bids to help out. Similarly, when the opponents open the bidding we want to keep our notrump structure intact whenever possible. We can do that well, but with a few adjustments here and there. |PG||AT|
 
Why a direct overcall of 1NT needs a little higher—18 points or so. Because it’s more dangerous to overcall 1NT than to open 1NT. Our left-hand opponent is in a better position to make a penalty double if the deal belongs to their side. The opening bid has shown some strength and given an indication of the best opening lead. So we’d like a little extra when we come into the fray.

The other difference from the 1NT opening bid is that we need one or more stoppers—high cards and length—in opener's suit. This is because our left-hand opponent now has a good idea what to lead, especially if the opening bid is in a major, promising five or more cards.|PG||AT|

Double of a 1NT opening bid, almost universally, is for penalty and the opening bidder will usually choose to defend except with a very distributional hand. However, many modern partnerships prefer to use it as a conventional takeout. |PG||AT|

Let us look at a few examples. Please click the blue "Next Page" top right to begin.|PG||NT||

st||pn|You,,Partner,|md|4S A Q T H j 5 D K Q 9 C A j84,0,0,0|sv|o|rh||ah|What to do - Example 1|NT|^B@2
The bidding starts with 1@S by East and you have this hand|mb|1s?|pg||lb|*bWhat bid would you make?^^1n|NT|^B@2
You have a balanced hand, 17 high-card points, and stoppers in spades. |mb|1n|PG||NT|^B@2
Of course your left hand opponent will lead a spade if the final contract is 1N If left-hand opponent leads a spade. However, your @SAQT will give you breathing room to develop your other tricks.|PG||NT|^B@2
This is a classic direct 1N overcall. A 15-18 HCP with adequate stoppers in the suit bid by the opener.|PG||NT|| 
%%example 2
st||pn|You,,Partner,|md|4S 9 4 H A t 6 5 D K q j C A Q J 6 ,,,|sv|o|rh||ah|What to do - Example 2|mb|1s?|lb|*bWhat do you bid with this hand?^^x|NT|^B@2
You have a balanced had and 17 HCP but you have no stoppers in spades. But you do not have to pass. You make a takeout double. |mb|x|PG||NT||

1NT overcall in the balancing position shows about 11–14 points—about 3 points less (some expert use a different range but very close to 11-14). However, the stopper requirement is the same as the direct 1N overcall. So here you can over call 1N|MB|1n|PG||NT||

With this hand a pass probably is the best preventing the RHO to bid and let the LHO struggle.|MB|p|PG||NT||

1N overcall is the bid. True both opponents have bid. But you have both suits stopped and you have a 17 HCP balanced hand. 1N in this position is very dangerous so a sound hand even up to 18 points is a must.|MB|1n|PG||NT|^B@2
Next we will change the format and deal with higher level NT overcalls.|PG||AT|

^B@2^*BMM: That was from my source. However, Howard has the following critique.^*N|PG||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Personally I would overcall 2@C rather than bidding 1N. Also note that many people play that a 1NT overcall after both opponents have bid is known as a "sandwich NT" showing the other 2 suits and less than an opening hand. |PG||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|They double with the other 2 suits and an opener. It is rare that you have a 15-18 balanced hand after both opponents have bid. And even if you do, partner has to have a very weak hand since the opponents have shown they have at least around 20 HCP between them.|PG||NT||bt||md||

Generally you do not wish to overcall  when the opponents have bid to the two level or higher. They most likely have most of the strength. NT overcall, however, after a weak 2 or a weak 3 opening is an exception. Overcalling 2N after a weak 2 or overcalling 3N after a weak 3 opening is usually done with 15-18 points and good stopper in the opening suit like we have here. With this hand you should bid 2N. Another quiz is next.

^C2@C is the Stayman convention,

If the partnership normally plays other conventions over a lNT opening -such as four-suit transfers, Texas transfers, or Lebensohl-they would also apply after the lNT overcall when playing "Systems On."

Similar to the treatment after 1N overcall many partnership play ^*BSystem On-Double Stolen bid^*N but at a higher level where:
^C3@C would be Stayman, 
^C3@D would be a transfer to hearts, and 
^C3@H would be a transfer to spades. 
^C3@S would mean, in most instances, would be a transfer to minors.|PG||AT| 

With this hand, South can bid 3@C—Stayman convention. South should not consider anything further than a game because partner's 2N only promisees 15-18 points. 18 + 12 = 30 which is not enough for a slam.

After a 3NT Overcall responder has problem unless they have clearly agreed on what approach should be used and overcaller remembers. A reasonable agreement is to go with the same approach as over 1NT
and 2NT. So, 
^C4@C would be Stayman,
^Cand 4@D and 4@H would be transfer bids.|PG||AT|

With this hand the proper bid is 4@H transferring to 4@S. It wold be bad news if partner pass—as we see now. To make it easier other partnership play the responders bid to be natural and to play. Therefore here the responder's bid is 4@S—to play. It just happens that in majority of instances the pass, and playing in 3N, is the best bid.|ht|e|
