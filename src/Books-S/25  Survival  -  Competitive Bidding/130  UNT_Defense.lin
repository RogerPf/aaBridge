The bid always shows the two lower unbid suits-at least five cards in each suit. 
After a major opening it always shows the two minors. 
After a minor opening it shows heart and the other minor.

^B@2The defense against Two-Suited Overcalls outlined by Marty Bergen probably is the easiest to learn. Therefore, this section is based mainly on Marty Bergen's ^*IBetter Bidding With Bergen Volume II^*N : |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.martybergen.com^*N|CP||AT|. However, in preparing this section we also have borrowed from Mr. Roth's teaching—they are very similar.

^-|FP||ht|d|cs||cp||AT|^B@2The defense against two-suited overcall bids is ingenious and based on the difference between constructive and competitive bidding principles. In competitive bidding, after an overcall, the Opener's partner loses a few of his original options—bids—but gains a few new ones—cuebid of the overcalled suit. For example when the bidding goes 1@S -(followed by a suit overcall)- now responder can cuebid the overcalled suit to show a limit raise or better.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

The same principle is used in defense against two-suited overcalls except in most instances, there are two suits known. For that reason defending against UNT overcalls is the easier of the two because a jump overcall in Notrump by the opponent ^*Balways^*N shows the two lower unbid suits. Because the two suits are known, therefore, there would be two new cuebids available for the Opener's partner. They are the cuebid of the ^*Blower unbid suit shown^*N (cheaper cuebid) and the cuebid of the next unbid suit, or ^*Bthe higher^*N of the two if you will (the ##2 cuebid).|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|

Each cuebid has a specific meaning and along with the other options available to the Opener's partner form a solid line of defense. Before we look at a few examples a schematic diagram of the defense lines is in order. It is from Mr. Roth's paper. In our diagram we will start with 1@H-2N-? bidding. You may find it repetitious but trust me it would not hurt to have it pounded in our brains—at least my brain :).|

Again the 2N shows the two minor suits—clubs and diamonds. Therefore, the 3@C is the cheaper cuebid and 3@D is ##2 cuebid. In this bidding cycle and the previous one Opener's partner loses the 1N, 2@C, 2@H and 2@S bids because of the 2N overcall. However, all the other bids starting from 4@D on are available and they maintain their original constructive meaning.|

PG| ***** 13 ***** |


AT|^B@2

Number of experts (Howard included) play the cheaper and ##2 cuebids the other way. That is the cheaper cue bid shows the cheaper suit (e.g. 1@S-2N-3@C shows hearts) and the higher cue bid shows the higher suit (e.g 1@S-2N-3@D shows spades).|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |

The rest of bids available to the Opener's Partner have the same meaning as in the competitive bidding. We will deal with those shortly.|

Double = Interest in doubling one, or both, minors. Opener is invited to double any bid by the partner of the UNT bidder or pass it back to partner.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |

Utilizing these methods enable Opener's partner to locate four-four major suit fits, use transfers when responder has a long major, and penalize 3@C or 3@D when he has good defense against the minors. |

Mr. Roth continues, "These treatments and adjustments will help you to counter the Unusual Notrump, but you will not find in them a master key to unlock all doors, for there is none. In practice, we attempt to follow the sage advice of ^*IS. J. Simon^*N, the great British expert, whose philosophy in competitive auctions was '^*BGet the best result possible; not necessarily the best possible result.^*N' We have found that this is good advice in resolving just about all bridge problems."|

^*BMM^*N :|CP||AT|Now it is time to go through a few exercises. To show the effect of a two-suited overcall on the competitive bidding, the first few are standard responses to the opening bid without the overcall. In all we would be playing SAYC as the 2/1 is off after a jump overcall. |

Now let us look at the bidding cycle when the RHO overcalls 2NT—Unusual Notrump (UNT).|UB|2|mb|2N|an|5 clubs and 5 diamonds.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Clearly, now all the bids through 2NT which you had when the RHO passed disappear—Pass still is an option of course. On the other hand, two cuebids-based on the two suits implied by the overcaller-the two lower unbid suits-become available.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In the case of 1@S opening the two suits implied are clubs and diamonds. Thus, the responder (you sitting South) gains ^*Bthe 3@C cuebid—the cheaper cuebid—and 3@D cuebid or ##2 cuebid.^*N|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With those two new bids let us take a look at all the options for Opener's partner. Also a few of the previous bids have different meaning. Let us look at them.|

For defense against a UNT overcall when the two suits implied are known we can use the simple guideline just outlined. Case closed. On balance the responder loses a few of his bids but gains two cuebids-the cheaper = good raise of partner's suit; Cuebid ##2 = game force in fourth suit. Let us try it after 1@C opening.|

Many experts are concerned about the "or better" portion as the partnership may be faced with 4-1 trump break.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


AT| After a one suited overcall Howard plays the limit raise or better to show 4-card support. But he adds, "Since the 2N takes up so much bidding room, the cuebid here only promises good 3-card support. This is in contrast to 1@S-2@D-?, where there is much more room to bid a new suit, and I prefer that 3@D shows 4+ card support."|

This is a good example of the "or better" for 3@C-the cheaper cuebid-showing a limit raise or better, Even if partner signs off in 3@S, you would bid 4@S. Of course you may consider the Law of Total Tricks and bid 4@S right away. There is only a small probability that you may miss slam in spades.|

What is the double by Opener's partner (you) in this bidding sequence?|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It conveys the same message as a redouble after a takeout double. The doubler shows 10+ points. It also tends to deny support for opener's suit (because then responder would bid #1 cue bid) or length in the 4th suit (because then responder would bid #2 cue bid).|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Further, it sends a strong message that we cannot let them buy the contract undoubled. Quite often, one or the other will end up doubling the opponents. Let us look at a suitable hand for South in this bidding cycle.|
