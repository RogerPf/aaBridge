BROMAD was created by American expert Marty Bergen in the 1980s.}

^-|ht|i|at|^B@2BROMAD is an acronym for "Bergen Raises of a Major After a Double." It is a set of conventional raises by responder after hearing a 1@H/1@S opening bid and an opposing takeout double:|
ht|k|at|^A  Bid|HT|k|AT|^d@2Meaning|
Ht|l|at|^A  XX   	^DRedouble is not part of BROMAD, but is worth mentioning. It shows 10+ points and denies 3+ card support.
^A  2@C  	^DA 3-card "Constructive" raise, showing 7-10 points and exactly 3-card trump support.
^A  2@D  	^DA 3-card "Limit" raise or better, showing 10+ points and exactly 3-card trump support.
^A  2@H/2@S 	^DA 3-card "Preemptive" raise, showing 0-6 points and exactly 3-card trump support.
^A  2NT  	^DA preempt in clubs or diamonds (i.e. a hand that would normally make a 3 or 3@D weak jump shift).
^A  3@C  	^DA 4-card "Constructive" raise, showing 7-10 points and exactly 4-card trump support. 
^A  3@D  	^DA 4-card "Limit" raise, showing 10-12 points and exactly 4-card trump support. 
^A  3@H/3@S ^dA 4-card "Preemptive" raise, showing 0-6 points and exactly 4-card trump support. 

^B@2BROMAD assumes that the partnership plays 5-card majors. The theory is to reach the correct level of bidding in accordance with the Law of Total Tricks.

Note that the preemptive direct raises (i.e. 1@S : 2/3@S) are based on the principle of fast arrival. They are designed rob the opponents of bidding space as quickly as possible.

^bThe BROMAD 3-level responses are identical to Bergen Raises, which are systemic raises used in uncontested auctions. A few examples are next.|
