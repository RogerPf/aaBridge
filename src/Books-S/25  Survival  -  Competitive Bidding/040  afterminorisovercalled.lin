^-{    General Approach after an Overcall - Minor Suit Opening    }
^-|CS||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Following an overcall of a minor suit opening by partner there are several important points you should always consider before making any responses.|
PG| ***** 0 ***** |


AT|

1. The game chances are not as likely when your partner opens a minor suit. And it is more likely the opponents can out bid you at the same level in the majors. So your objective is to get in their way promptly.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

2. Inverted Raises are off.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|

3. A cue bid is available to show a limit raise. Therefore, there is no reason to play a raise to 2 is strong.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|

4. When opening one of a minor, 85% or more of the time partner will have 4+ cards although it is possible that partner only has a 3-card suit. So bid as if he/she does have four.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|

5. Your first priority as in constructive bidding still is to show a major. |
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


AT|

Absent a major your hand either is worth 6-9 or 10+ points.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


AT|

With less than six points you pass.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT|

Bid 1NT with a stopper in the overcaller's suit and 8-11 points.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


AT|

Raise to 2 with 4 card support and 6-9 points—no 4+ card majors.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


AT|

Jump raise to 3 with 5 card support, 6-9 points, and no 4+ card majors—note additional trump card needed.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


AT|

With 10+ points and at least 4 cards in opener's suit (assuming you have no major suits) cue bid.|

^b@22C bid is clear. You don't have 4 hearts nor a strong suit of your own, so there is no other choice. You should be eager to raise in competition to get in their way and encourage partner to compete further.|

NT||lb|*bWhat would you bid?^^|mb||nt|
^b@2Double is probably the best bid. And that is what I recommend. But with such nice clubs and bad hearts, if you decided to bid 2C, I would say that would not be a bad choice either.|

pg| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||lb|*bWhat would you bid?^^3c|mb|3c|nt|
^b@2Here the choice is not as clear. Most people would double and that might work out when partner has a strong hand and hearts. But remember you only have an 8-card fit at best in hearts (partner would open 1H with 5) and they probably have a spade fit. So tactically I like 3C better. |
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It makes it harder for them to bid in spades and you are likely to have a 9-card fit. At least partner will probably be better positioned to compete when you bid 3C. Therefore, despite my 4 hearts, I recommend 3C (but if you want to double, that could work out on some hands).|

pg| ***** 43 ***** |


NT||lb|*bWhat would you bid?^^1n|mb|1n|nt|
^b@2Both 2S and 1N are possible. 2S identifies your strong clubs. It also is more preemptive, always good in competition. On the other hand 1N shows your points, spade stopper, and is more precise. I would lean towards 1N, unless playing against a real strong pair, where I want to get in their way with 2S. Either is fine.|

^b@2This is similar to the previous hand, but you have a 5th club. Again both 1N and 2S are possible. But on this hand with our likely 9-card fit I favor 2S over 1N.|

pg| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||lb|*bWhat would you bid?^^2s|mb|2s|nt|
^b@22S is the best bid. You could conceivably end up playing in a 7-card fit at the 3 level but that is extremely unlikely. Partner is almost certainly short in spades making it very likely he or she has 4+ clubs. Therefore, 2S is very clear and low risk.|
