It happens that aaBridge contains the best introduction to ^*b Suit Combinations ^*n that there is.  Actually it is far more than an introduction as you will see if you follow the link below.

|lg|f|at|After a session of bridge when you review your play (you do a review, don't you) see ^*g :BBO Hands to aaBridge::Welcome, BBO Hands to aaBridge^*n.  You can pick out the spots where you did not know best to play a particular suit combination then look it up in the BridgeHands SuitComb table.   Then make and keep a note on this combination.

How to do this is covered in the next few pages.|

at|The ^*b BridgeHand's Suit Combinations ^*n table you get to when you follow the ^*hhttps://www.bridgehands.com/S/Suit_Combinations.htm,link^*n looks something like the one on the right, except the real one also has |cp|gr|at|^*bgreen stripes^*n|cp||at|. 

The important thing to understand is that each  'HCP entry'  links to its own large table.  And that each entry is the number of HCP help by the Opps.

The number of HCP held by the Opps is used because that is normally your first concern.  i.e.  What high cards are you missing in the suit ?

ht|l|n^|9|at|^f@2You play in a contract and this is the holding in a key suit.^z@3
|n^|9|at|
When you come to look back at the hand you want to know how you should have played it.
|n^|9|at|
The key question you need to ask yourself is: 
|n#|3|at|
|fp|t|at|^bHow Many tricks do I need from this suit ?|fp||at|
^c@2|n^|6|at|
Let's say you need ^*b 3 tricks ^*n to make your contract. |fp|s|at|  (missing the Ace you can never expect to make 4)|fp||at|
you have the ^*b KQ^*n,  this means Opps have the ^*b AJ ^*n  and ^*b 5 HCP^*n.
|n^|9|at|
Click the  ^*h https://www.bridgehands.com/S/Suit_Combination_5.htm,5 HCP ^*n link in the real BridgeHand's table.  When the page opens, scroll down hunting for the suit combination you want to know about.
|n^|9|at|
You will find in on ^*b row 35 ^*n.  @2Take care because this table also has the entries for  '^*bOpps have  KQ^*n'   and that part of the table ALSO has a row 35.
^c@2There are two sub-rows in the entry, one for making 3 tricks and one for making 2.  The entry for 3 says:
|n^|6|at|
^d  |cp|gr|at|^*b Play low toward Q then finesse J (low toward 10)^*n|cp||at| 
|n^|6|at|
It also tells you that this line has a ^*b 40% ^*n chance of making 3 tricks.

If you look in the far LEFT-hand column in the lower section you will see a number of entries with names like
^d@2^*b|lg|h|at|
|n^|k|at|
^*n   ---- ----- ^*b
AJ 35.  KTxx  -  Qxxx
AJ 36.  KTxx  -  QT98
AJ 37.  Kxxx  -  Qxxx
^*n   ---- ----- ^*b
KQ 35.  A987  -  Jxx
KQ 36.  Axxx  -  JT9
^*n^c@2
The first entry matches ^*b Row 35 ^*n of the ^*b BridgeHands   AJ ^*n  table that we have just been looking at.
|n^|9|at|
You can go to that entry and play out the hands against selected Opps distributions.   The samples also include Row 35 and 36 entries for the^*b KQ ^*n table which (of course) also comes under  'the Opps have 5 HCP'.
|n^|3|at|
If you want to develop your aaBridge skills you can create your own Suit Combinations lin files. It's not as hard as you might expect.  Look in the  ^*g :Doc Collection, aaBridge Doc Collection^*n  and
