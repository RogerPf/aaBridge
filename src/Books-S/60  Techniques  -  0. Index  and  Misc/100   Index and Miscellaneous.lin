at|This (the Techniques Section of ^*b Books-S^*n) has been re-structured to use the first column of categories given by Richard Pavlicek in his Techniques section at  ^*hhttp://www.rpbridge.net/rppt.htm,rpbridge.net  rrpt^*n. I am grateful for his permission to use the material.

|n#|4|at|Readers who want to break through to 'advanced', at the heart of which is developing the skill to 'count the hand' will ^*b also ^*n need to have a relatively complete 'kit of techniques'.
|n#|7|at|While this section cannot hope to teach every technique, the hope is that it will at least allow the aspiring player to know the extent of what they have yet to learn. |
