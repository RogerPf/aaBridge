is where you choose the master hand (the hand that draws trumps) as the SHORTER trump hand.  It follows that you need to ruff in the long trump hand so that is it reduced to fewer trumps than the master hand.  The first few ruff(s), which reduce the two hands to equal trump length, generate NO extra tricks.|
