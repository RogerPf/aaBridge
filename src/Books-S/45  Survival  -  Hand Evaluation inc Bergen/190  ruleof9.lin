1. Bid his/her best suit. 
2. Raise the suit of the partner with a minimum of two or more but no less. 
3. Pass for penalty when holding length and defensive values in the suit of the opponent.|

cs||FP||CP||NT|^B@2
Yes, many experts use Rule of 9 while some experts dislike ^*bRules^*n in general and rely on experience. They go by the length and strength in the overcall suit and lack of support for partner.|

However, Rule of Nine can assist less experienced partner in arriving at the best auction when forced to respond. In the Ruel of 9. responder adds:|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


NT|^B@2
a. the level of the contract;
b. the number of cards held in the suit of the opponent; and 
c. the number of honors held in the suit of the opponent (this includes the 10).|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


NT|^B@2
1. If the sum is |CP|8|AT|nine or more|CP||AT|, then the partner should pass for penalty.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |

2. If the sum is |CP|8|AT|eight or less|CP||AT|, then the partner should bid on.|

For example, with clubs holding as is shown above Rule of 9 says North should pass for penalty.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


MB|P|AT|
Because the sum is 9 (2 for contract level, 5 for number of cards held in opponent's suit, and 2 for number of honors held in that suit).|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |

In this example North should bid on as the sum is 7 (2 for contract level, 4 for the number of cards held in the overcalled suit and 1 for the number of the honor in that suit).|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I do not like the Rule of 9. One big flaw is, it does not take into account how many cards you hold in partner's suit.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you have a singleton or void in pard's suit, that says you are likely to pass if you have length in the opponent's suit. If you have 2, it is marginal to pass. If you have 3 in pard's suit, it is almost never right to pass, regardless of what the Rule of 9 says.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, on hand C, I would pass with AQxx of clubs with shortness in spades. In fact, I might even pass with AQx of clubs. And I would pass with Axxx of clubs if short in spades.|
