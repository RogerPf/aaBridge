^B@2^*BMM: ^*NI don't know about you but as Howard's student I have been sold on the LAW and use it particularly in completive bidding as I use cream with my coffee—every time and plenty of it.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |

However, some of my partners often do not appreciate such zealotry particularly when they have to declare and our contract goes up in smoke. That is when I have to defend the LAW with meager success. Of course the entire mishap probably is because I have not fully learned the LAW. Next let us look at a recent board which caused me a long timeout in the nearby porcupine adobe. BTW, sine this a long presentation we have divided it in several sections as outlined below.

Partner: Obviously not - but why 3 when 2 is enough. Why did you originally passed BTW?|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


AT|
nome: To stop them from putting their noses in our tent. Further, I probably should have cue bid to show a limit raise, but you would still compete to 3@S over 3@H based on the law. And finally E/W can make 3@H so my LAW worked just fine.|

^B@2^*BMike Lawrence: ^*N|cp||at|West overcalls 1@S, another easy choice. Some players double with hands like this because they want to find their best major-suit fit.

^B@2^*BMike Lawrence: ^*N|cp||at|West would bid 1@S even without the @CQ. East must recognize that his partner overcalled 1@S as opposed to opening 1@S. There is a big difference between what East can expect West to have after an opening bid and after an overcall.|

THEORY
^-|at|
The Law of Total Tricks is currently the most widely used guideline in competitive bidding situations. Although only fragmentary statistical evidence in support of the law was available when the original Bridge World article, excerpted below, was published, recent research, spurred by the availability of cheap computing power, has shown that the law is remarkably accurate. Details of its precision (how much the estimate it provides varies from deal to deal) are also available, and most current experimentation in this field deals with guidelines for recognizing situations in which deviations from the global total-trick average are likely to occur.|

The Law of Total Tricks
by Jean-Rene Vernes
^-|FP||AT|
As we all realize, the aim of point-count valuation is to determine the precise level to which we can afford to bid. However, a more exacting analysis indicates that we can find ourselves in two entirely different bidding situations:|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT|| 
st||pn||md|2,,,|rh||ah|Example  A|mb|1h1sp4s|NT|^B@2
In the above bidding, South's bid means simply, "Partner, my hand is such that, even if you are minimum for your overcall, we can probably make four spades." To come to this conclusion, South has only to apply the classical methods of hand evaluation.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


AT| But suppose that the bidding went this way with East bidding 4@H.|ub|2|mb|4h4s|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Here, the significance of South's bid may be quite different. Perhaps he expects to make four spades. But it could equally be that he is expecting to take a one- or two-trick set, even doubled, thinking that East-West will make four hearts. We are in the domain of competitive bidding.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now, in this extremely common position the classical rules are helpless to solve our problems. Certainly it is easy to figure out that with good vulnerability it will pay to go down two, doubled, to stop an enemy game; and that it is sometimes advantageous to go down one to stop a part-score.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Point-count valuation will easily let us work out how many tricks we expect to make if partner is minimum for his bid. But we have no precise way to determine whether or not the opponents will make their contract. And nothing is more costly than to take a sacrifice against a contract that would have gone down.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT|^B@2
How, in fact, do good players determine, in these positions, whether to pass, or double, or bid on?|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


AT| We know, from long experience, that the prime factor is distribution: the more unbalanced it is, the more cards each side has in its trump suit, the higher is competition justified. |
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Beginners learn that the more high cards they have, the greater is their chance to make game. The discovery of an exact scale, fixing the relative value of the various honors, was a great step forward. But we do not have, today, a scale to tell us how high we can bid by virtue of our distribution.|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Could it be that there is no such scale, that in this area we must pride ourselves on our intuition?|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


AT| No--my aim is to show that competitive decisions are subject to a precise law, and a particularly simple one what's more. And just as it is impossible to talk of constructive bidding without reference to accurate hand valuation, it is impossible to investigate competitive bidding without at least indirect consideration of this law—an example next.|

In the other room, they were allowed to play two spades, East-West. Analysis shows that the result was never in doubt. North made ten tricks in clubs, losing only one spade and two red aces, while West made eight tricks in spades at the other table, losing one spade, one diamond, one club and two hearts.|
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now I will ask the reader to consider an unfamiliar concept that I call "total tricks"--the total of the tricks made by the two sides, each playing in its best trump suit. In the deal above, the number of total tricks is 18 (10 for North-South in clubs, plus 8 for East-West in spades). |
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now, even though it is not possible, in the course of a competitive auction, to determine how many tricks the opponents will make, can it be possible to predict, on average, the number of total tricks? If so, this average figure cannot help but be of lively interest in making competitive decisions.|
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In fact, this average exists, and can be expressed in an extremely simple law:|
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


NT||fp|3|cs|1|cp|4|at|^-
{
The number of total tricks in a hand is
  approximately equal to the total number of trumps held by both sides,  
each in its respective suit.
}^-|
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


NT||fp||cp||cs||at|^B@2
In the example above, North-South have ten clubs, East-West eight spades. Thus, the total number of trumps is 18, the same as the total number of tricks.|
PG| ***** 96 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You may notice that in this deal the number of trumps held by each side was equal to the number of tricks it actually made--ten for North-South, eight for East-West. That is pure coincidence. It is only the equality between the total number of trumps and the total number of tricks that obeys a general law.|
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This "law of total tricks" surely seems very surprising at first sight. An analysis of the deal I have presented will show why it works. East-West could not know which opponent held the king of diamonds. Had it been with South, West would have been able to make one trick more playing spades. But then, clearly, North would have made one trick fewer playing in his club contract. Thus, the actual number of tricks made by one declarer varies according to the location of a key card, but the number of total tricks remains the same.|
PG| ***** 98 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Two major elements of uncertainties (will a finesse work? will a suit split well or badly?), uncertainty that no classical method of valuation can possibly resolve, [often] disappear when we calculate the total tricks. |
PG| ***** 99 ***** |


NT|^B@2
These were the considerations that led to the discovery of the law of total tricks. Still, although they seem to clarify how the law operates, only a thorough statistical study could bring us sufficient proof of its accuracy. |
PG| ***** 100 ***** |


NT||
AT|^B@2
A more detailed analysis of the deals on which the statistics were based verified this conclusion. It showed that had the cards been played perfectly, that is, double-dummy, the total-trick formula would have given an exactly accurate prediction in well over half the cases. What is more, it showed that the number of total tricks would often have been lower than that actually won--the knowledge that declarer had of his side's full resources gave him an appreciable edge.|
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


NT|^B@2
At double-dummy, the number of total tricks closely approximates the theoretical number indicated by the formula. The supplementary quarter of a trick per deal at the table may well be, in large part, "declarer's advantage." |

Corrections

^-|at|We have established a formula for predicting total tricks that is both very simple, and quite accurate in a majority of instances. Still, just as we have to make corrections, occasionally, in a good point-count method, so too must the law of total tricks be modified. There are three extra factors. |
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


AT|

(1) The existence of a double fit, each side having eight cards or more in two suits. When this happens, the number of total tricks is frequently one trick greater than the general formula would indicate. This is the most important of the "extra factors." |
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


AT|

(2) The possession of trump honors. The number of total tricks is often greater than predicted when each side has all the honors in its own trump suit. Likewise, the number is often lower than predicted when these honors are owned by the opponents. (It is the middle honors--king, queen, jack--that are of greatest importance.) Still, the effect of this factor is considerably less than one might suppose. So it does not seem necessary to have a formal "correction," but merely to bear it in mind in close cases.|
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


AT| 

(3) The distribution of the remaining (non-trump) suits. Up to now we have considered only how the cards are divided between the two sides, not how the cards of one suit are divided between two partners. This distribution has a very small, but not completely negligible, effect.|
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


NT||at|^- 

Safety Levels

^-|AT|The law of total tricks has many practical uses. The principal one is that it allows us to distinguish between two forms of safety. We may call them "security of honors" and "security of distribution." Suppose the bidding goes like this: 
|HT|g|cs|6|at|{|ia|p1sp3s|at|}|HT|j|at|
North and South could each have mediocre distribution, but then they must have a high enough point count (say, 24 points) to expect to make the contract. The bid of three spades is protected by "security of honors."|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


AT| In contrast, if the bidding goes: 
|HT|m|at|{|ia|1h1s3h3s|at|}|HT|p|at|
South could be bidding three spades with a good fit even with a low point-count, to stop East-West from making three hearts. This three-spade bid will usually be slightly profitable if either side can make its contract, even if the other's contract would be down one. Of course, it will show a loss if both three spades and three hearts go down. And it will be most successful when both contracts make. In the first case, the deal has 17 total tricks; in the second case, 16; and in the third case 18. The figure 17 is the total-trick minimum at which we can outbid the opponents to the three-level. Thus, we may say that such a competitive bid is protected by "security of distribution." |
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


NT||at|^-
A Practical Rule

^-|at|Unfortunately, it is very difficult in practice to determine the total number of trumps. (Oddly, this calculation is often somewhat easier for the defending side than for opener's. For example, you can usually work out the total trumps with great precision when a reliable partner makes a takeout double of a major-suit opening.) Most often, though, players can tell exactly how many trumps their side has, but not how many the opponents have. However, this itself is sufficient to allow the law of total tricks to be applied with almost complete safety. |
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


AT|

Consider, for example, in the second bidding sequence presented earlier and is repeated below,

|cs|6|at|{|ia|1h1s3h3s|at|} 

and suppose that South has four spades. After partner's one-spade overcall, he can count on him for at least five spades, or nine spades for his side. Thus, East-West have at most four spades among their 25 cards. In other words, they must have a minimum of eight trumps in one of the three remaining suits. Thus, South can count for the deal a minimum of 9+8=17 total tricks. So a bid of three spades is likely to show a profit, and at worst will break approximately even.|
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


AT| 

A similar analysis shows that the situation is entirely different when South has only three spades, so that his side has a considerable chance of holding only eight of its trumps. To reach the figure of 18 total tricks, it is now necessary for East-West to hold ten cards in their suit--not impossible, but hardly likely. It is much more reasonable to presume that the deal will yield only 16 or 17 total tricks. Thus, it is wrong to go beyond the two level; three spades must lose or break even. |
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


NT||at|

As we examine one after another of the competitive problems at various levels, we find that the practical rule appropriate to each particular case can be expressed as a quite simple general rule: You are protected by "security of distribution" in bidding for as many tricks as your side holds trumps. Thus, with eight trumps, you can bid practically without danger to the two level, with nine trumps to the three level, with ten to the four level, etc., because you will have either a good chance to make your contract or a good save against the enemy contract. |
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


AT|

This rule holds good at almost any level, up to a small slam (with only one exception: it will often pay to compete to the three level in a lower ranking suit when holding eight trumps). Of course, the use of this rule presupposes two conditions: (1) the point-count difference must not be too great between the two sides, preferably no greater than 17-23, certainly no greater than 15-25; (2) the vulnerability must be equal or favorable. For this rule to operate on unfavorable vulnerability, your side must have as many high cards as the opponents (or more).

Discussing the Law of Total Tricks
^-|fp||at|^-by Mike Lawrence & Anders Wirgren
^-|FP||AT|^B@2
Ever heard of the Law of Total Tricks? We guess you have. Formulated by .... Today, few people, whether experts or just average players, seem to question its accuracy.|
PG| ***** 140 ***** |


AT|

The Law of Total Tricks, or the Law, as its adherents usually call it, is a theory which says:|
pg| ***** 141 ***** |


CS|1|fp|2|CP|4|at|

^-{"The number of tricks your side can take, if you play in your best trump suit,
    added to the number of tricks the opponents can take, if they play in their best trump suit,    
is approximately equal to the number of trumps held by both sides."}
^-|
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


fp||cp||CS||AT|
So, if North-South's best trump suit is spades, where they hold eight cards, and East-West's best trump suit is clubs, where they hold nine cards, the total number of trumps is 17. If the sum of the tricks North-South can take in spades and the tricks East-West can take in clubs – the total tricks – also is 17, the deal is according to the Law.|
PG| ***** 143 ***** |


AT|

What is important to remember is that Vernes was talking about average values. And if you take a large number of deals and compare the average total tricks with the average total trumps, they will indeed be approximately equal. So far, so good.|
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


AT|

What Vernes didn't say – and definitively didn't mean – but which many people think the Law says, is that "^*BTotal tricks and total trumps are equal on any deal^*N". One of the reasons why this false claim is so popular is that Larry Cohen formulated the Law that way in his first book To Bid or Not to Bid. Even The Official Encyclopedia of Bridge has got it wrong, by including the expression "on any given bridge deal", words which weren't present in the original and correct definition of the Law. It is important to understand this, because the truth is that it is more likely that trumps and tricks are not equal (roughly 60% versus 40%).|
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


AT|

If you are a questioning person you may wonder why trumps and tricks should go hand in hand. Lots have been written about the Law, but practically no explanation has been given. Larry Cohen skips the issue, just like the other main proponent of the theory, Cohen's former partner Marty Bergen. And there is a very simple reason for their silence: There is no connection. If we have a deal where the total tricks are 16 and the total trumps also are 16, the tricks are not a function of the trumps. They are related to each other only tenuously and indirectly.|

We who say so are three-time world champion Mike Lawrence of the USA and bridge theoretician Anders Wirgren of Sweden, and we can prove that the number of trumps is a poor guide to the number of tricks. Devotees of The Law have no proof to back up their claim. We will show you what is important in estimating your potential tricks and we will give you a brand new tool that will make you cry: "The Law is dead. Long live (the new) Law!".|

All this is presented in our book, I Fought the Law of Total Tricks, which tells you all you need to know about competitive bidding. Still, you may have questions and doubts, which we understand very well. After all, this thinking is new. We will try to help you along the way, so don't hesitate to contact us with questions and deals you want to have analyzed. If we find your question to be interesting, we will publish it here on this site together with an answer. And don't worry. You won't see any answers like "You can't expect the Law to be right on every deal," which used to be the stock retort of the other side. We will tell you exactly why. To submit a question and/or an interesting deal, use the links "Questions" or "Deals" in the left frame. Let us look at two examples, where both sides are vulnerable:|

^B@2^*BMike Lawrence: ^*N|cp||at|North-South have eight spades and can take nine tricks. East-West have eight hearts and can also take nine tricks. The total tricks are 18. Both sides have eight trumps, so the total number of trumps is 16. Therefore, this deal is not according to the Law. Since there are two more tricks than trumps, we call it +2.|
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMike Lawrence: ^*N|cp||at|And before the Law guys start screaming about "the need for adjustments" and mutter something about a factor called 'purity' (which, by the way, is just nonsense), we keep the same honors, give each side an extra trump and change the distribution slightly.

^B@2^*BMike Lawrence: ^*N|cp||at|Now the situation is the reversed. Here, the total trumps are 18, but the total tricks are 16. Since we now have two tricks fewer than the total trumps, we call the deal -2.

PG| ***** 152 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMike Lawrence: ^*N|cp||at|A corollary to the Law of Total Tricks, often called The Law of Total Trumps and sometimes confused with it, is that you should "always bid to the same level as your number of trumps". And a few years ago Larry Cohen won a prize for a bridge tip titled "Eight never, nine ever." With that he meant that in deciding whether to bid 3-over-3, say 3 spades over the opponents' 3 diamonds, you shouldn't do it with eight trumps but you should with nine.|
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMike Lawrence: ^*N|cp||at|Applying this principle to the deals above, we realize that North-South will do the wrong thing on both occasions if East-West compete to 3 hearts. In diagram 1, they will let East-West play (eight never), and in diagram 2 they will bid 3 spades (nine ever). And in doing so, they have gone -140 instead of +140, and -100 instead of +100. Uh-oh!|

This is a special blog for my non-life master readers. It's not likely to make me a hit with my partners and other highly regarded bridge players of my acquaintance, but then I can't figure out how to publish this anonymously so here it is. Whether you are a beginner, novice, aspiring intermediate or in some other ascending category, you have to stop whatever you are doing right now and start pulling some cards out of the bidding box that are not green. You cannot – let me say that again – you cannot let good opponents freely engage in constructive bidding. This is what they do best. Leave them alone and they will get to an optimum contract 99% of the time. That is their specialty. You need to compete in the bidding.|

If you are going to compete, you need some weapons of mass destruction (WMD's) and you need to use them as often as possible, and sometimes even when you think it is a total embarrassment.. Bidding today is not you mother's bridge of the 20th century, it is guerilla warfare. Go watch some Texas Hold'em Poker on television and you will get in the right frame of mind. I was watching a teenager at a final table the other night playing for about $1,000,000 in real money, and in an interview he explained that the game is simple: "if they check, you raise, if they raise, you re-raise, if they raise back, you go all in." Do you think you can translate that to bridge?|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NThe quiz boards follow Bergen-Schutzman style which some expert may not fully agree with. They are mainly from: 

^*B1. The BBO lesson by Marty Bergen in association with Howard Schutzman In Mach 2011. The title was "The LAW of Total Trick."

2. MARTY BERGEN'S THE KEY TO COMPETITIVE BIDDING, booklet Number 19 - The LAW. If you missed the lesson the transcript still is available along with the booklet. Check out |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/hfh7vw^*N|CP||AT| or |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.martybergen.com/^*N|CP||AT|.^*B
3. Howard's mentoring sessions at BBO.

^*NWhat you have seen so far and what you will see next are small samples at best. However, you owe it to yourself and your partners to study this topic further. Reading the entire booklet 19 should be a must. Also you can get the transcript of his BBO lesson from this |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/audiolessons/mbaudiolessons.php^*N|CP||AT| link to really get a huge lift playing bridge. MM is so confident that he will gladly give your money back if you are not satisfied. There is only a catch. You have to talk with his porcupine friends first in order to get your money back.

In booklet 19 Bergen has 40 Principles with examples. I dare only to steal the most important ones. This section is a good review of those principles. Without further ado please click the forward arrow.|

Obviously, good judgment is critical, so you should not follow The LAW ^*Iblindly^*N (The italic fond was added in our shop). However, this principle is essential, so it's worth following whenever you can. This is true even if you know you have no chance to make your bid.|

As long as you follow The LAW, you‘ll make life as difficult as possible for the opponents. This is essential and will produce excellent results, and last but not least, it's a lot of fun. If the opponents can make a game or slam, going down 2 in 3@S is good bridge. Next let us mix it up -:).|

Bid 3@S. After the double, this is a perfect Weak Jump Raise. (If your RHO had passed, bid 3@S only if playing Bergen Raises.) In Standard, responder's jump raise after a takeout double is defined as weak. If you're reluctant to jump to 3@S when vulnerable or because you have 2 HCP, take some VITAMINS. This hand will be a useful dummy in a spade contract, but if E-W get the contract, you might as well take a nap. That brings us to the next two principles.|mb|3S|

PG| ***** 227 ***** |


NT||lb|*bWhat is your call with this hand?^^3S|NT|^B@2
Bid 3@S. You know that your side has 9 trump, so it is correct to contract for 9 tricks. Do you know that you'll take 9 tricks with this hand? Of course not. You don't know whether partner has a minimum or a maximum, or which honors he has. If you need to take a finesse, you can't know whether it will win. |mb|3S|
PG| ***** 229 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But it is clear that your ^*B6th spade^*N will be an asset if spades are trump, but a liability if clubs are trump. If E-W play in 3@C and your side has 9 spades, to win 2 spade tricks, their spades must divide 2-2 (40%). But if you had 5 spades, so your side had 8, to win 2 spade tricks, their spades must divide 3-2 (68%). That is a significant difference. With this board we covered another three principles. Let us look at them.|

PG| ***** 244 ***** |


NT||
ht|d|fp|1|cs|1|cp|4|at|^-{  Voids are offensive magic,

       }
^-|
pg| ***** 245 ***** |


fp||cs||cp||NT||AT|^B@2
Why are voids special? When you have a void and a fit, it's as if you are playing with a 30-point deck. The 10 HCP in the suit you're void in aren't essential, so you can expect to make contracts with far fewer HCP than are normally needed. If the void is in the opponents long strong suit, that's a big plus. |
PG| ***** 246 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Also keep in mind: Voids occur on only 1 out of every 20 hands. However, although you like being dealt a singleton, it is never a surprise. Approximately 1 out of every 3 hands you pick up will include a singleton. That's quite a difference.|

Lead was @S6. Needless to say, 3@H doubled was a total disaster. When the smoke cleared, South was down 4, for a score of -1100. So we have the following principle.|

^-|fp||cs||cp||
PG| ***** 252 ***** |


NT||at|^b@2
The only exceptions are when partner is short in the suit AND has a million trump, or he has a great suit of his own plus a lot of entries. Otherwise, having length in an opponent's suit will usually result in winning fewer tricks than needed. And when your length is in your LHO's suit, that is really bad. When you attempt to ruff your losers with partner's trump, your RHO will be able to overruff.|
PG| ***** 253 ***** |


AT|

Let us review a few more principles.|
PG| ***** 254 ***** |


NT||bt||
%%Page
ht|b|fp|1|cs|1|cp|4|at|^-{  If possible, try to not allow the opponents to  
      play at the same level as their number of trump.      }
^-|
pg| ***** 255 ***** |


fp||cs||cp||AT|^B@2 Your opponents are happy to play in a contract equal to their ## trump. If they are happy, then you are NOT happy. Of course, you can't apply this principle on every hand. On many hands, no one could possibly know the opponents ## trump. On other hands, even if you do know the exact number, it would be suicidal to take a bid at a high level.|
PG| ***** 256 ***** |


ht|i|fp|1|cs|1|cp|4|at|^-{  When your opponents have found a fit,
  strain to not allow them to play at the two level.  }

Experienced players know how important it is to balance. Next is a classic balancing auction:|
PG| ***** 258 ***** |


ht|o|at|^b{|ia|,,1hp2hpp?|at|}|
PG| ***** 259 ***** |


ht|t|at|^b@2E-W found a heart fit, but had no interest in game. It's safe to assume that their total ## HCP is 18-22, so your side has to have approximately 20 HCP. The ## HCP in your hand is irrelevant. If you're weak, your partner must have a decent hand; but did not have the right shape to take action. Therefore, on the above bidding sequence, the following actions are clear-cut.|

After E-W find a fit there are 2 types of modest hands that merit immediate action. Shortness in the opponent's suit is GREAT, so with 0-1 heart, strain to double or bid a suit or show 2 suits (Unusual 2NT). The second hand-type is a strong suit. West rates to become the declarer, so if you know the suit partner should lead, let him know loud and clear-clubs here.|mb|3c|
