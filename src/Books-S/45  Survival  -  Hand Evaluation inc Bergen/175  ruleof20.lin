^-|ht|c|cs||CP||fp||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First, let us look at standard Rule of 20. In standard Rule of 20, you add the number of cards in your two longest suits to hand's HCP. You can open if the total is 20 or more. Let me bring my hand over here.|

|HT|e|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|pSS2389QH2QD27AC29A|at|}|HT|e|AT|^j@2This hand has|hc|sQHQDACA|at| 12 HCP and the two longest suits (5 spades with 3 clubs or diamonds) have 8 cards-12+8 = 20. Therefore, based on standard Rule of 20 it is an opener. Here you use the full value for Aces, Kings, Queens, and Jacks.

Bergen, however, considers Queens and Jacks (quacks) over valued. Also he subtracts for what he calls dubious doubleton/singletons. On the other hand, he adds for 4+ card suits with three touching honors and when the hand is rich in Aces and tens.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


HT|l|at|^B@2Therefore, when a hand has quacks, is not rich in Aces/Tens or has a few dubious doubleton/singletons may not be an opener according to Bergen while it may be an opener in standard Rule of 20. Let me explain further.|

Bergen's Rule of 20 is the sum of two longest suits and his ^*Iadjusted HCP^*N. The ^*Iadjusted HCP^*N is the Starting Points less Length Points. Starting Points which is the value of the hand before any bidding has the following five parts.|

^-|ht|c|cs||CP||fp||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason you leave out the suit length part of Starting Points, when calculating adjusted HCP for the Rule of 20, is as follows. The Rule of 20 has 2 parts -- HCP and the length of your 2 longest suits. Adjusted HCP take care of the HCP part of the Rule of 20. The length of your 2 longest suits part already takes into account length points, so to include that when calculating the HCP part of the Rule of 20 would be double counting. |

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NYou probably are questioning the differences. It is very simple. Bergen considers Aces and Kings under valued while Queens and Jacks (quacks) are over valued. Further, he subtracts points for dubious Singleton/Doubletons while he adds points for quality suits. Then he has the Adjust-3 in which he gives points to the hands rich in Aces and Tens while subtracts points when the hand is poor in those. Please use this |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/x6vpsw^*N|CP||AT| link for additional information on Bergen's hand evaluation.|
