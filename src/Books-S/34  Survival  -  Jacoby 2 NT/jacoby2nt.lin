^-|fp||cs||cp||at|^B@2
Opener's rebids after Jacoby 2NT is simple as long as we follow a "more often than not" Bergen-Schutzman style and not to worry about the esoteric chatters. At the end there are several references for your additional review.|
PG| ***** 0 ***** |


AT|

The Jacoby 2N promises 4-card support and 13+ points (Bergen hand evaluation is the guide). Here, quickly, we need to mention that in Bergen-Schutzman style you may use splinter bid if you have a void or singleton and the hand is worth 13 to 16 points. But responder should bid Jacoby 2N if his/her hand is worth 17+ points with or without a void or singleton.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |

After a 2N response, opener's hand either has:|

Next there are few examples. The section is a double delight because you learn Bergen's hand evaluation along with how to respond to Jacoby 2N -:). You are (North) and open 1@H/1@S and pard bids 2N. Look at the hand and after counting the points (using Bergen hand evaluation) choose your bid?|

^C@2^Z@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|4@C. Let me review the criteria for bidding a new suit at the 4 level.
You need a good 5 card suit, either 2 of the top 3 or 3 of the top 5 and 13 HCP or less. This hand qualifies, so 4@C is the bid. By "HCP" I mean Raw HCP. Here, Bergen does not use Bergen points.

^C@2^Z@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|3@H is the correct bid. This hand is worth 19 Declarer points. Remember, when calculating points for length, you use regular length points for starting points (3 for 7 card suit). You then double dip, by adding extra points for trump length above 5, so you add 2 additional points for the 7 card heart suit if that is the trump suit.

So far my results have been very good using Bergen's methods. at worst, I have bid some slams on 1 finesse.
