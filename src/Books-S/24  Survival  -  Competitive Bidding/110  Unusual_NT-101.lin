^-|cp||fp||AT|
The 1NT and 2NT overcalls have different meaning depending whether it is an immediate overcall, an overcall by a passed hand, by an unpassed hand or an overcall by a passed (or even unpassed) hand in a balancing seat. The good news, however, is that the complicated variations are rare.|

^-{    When 2NT is Not UNT - Howard Schutzman    }
^-|cs||CP||fp||ht|d|at|I understand that here I should cover situations which may be vague or there may be two different interpretations of a certain NT overcall. So, let me briefly mention one special situation. If a partnership plays a strong club system, such as Precision, where a 1@C opener is completely artificial, showing 16+ points and saying nothing about clubs, then 1@C-2N shows clubs and diamonds.|
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


AT|

This is in line with the general bidding principle that when the opponents make an artificial bid that says nothing about the suit bid, any bid that you make that could show that suit in fact does show that suit. Therefore, if a pair is playing a strong club system, then 1@C-2@C shows clubs. |
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


AT|

Another examples of that principle is that 1N-P-2@D (transfer)-3@D shows diamonds. Having said that, if a pair plays the "short club" (e.g 1@C can be as few as 2 clubs), 1@C is still natural (in that it usually shows club length), so 1@C-2N still shows diamonds and hearts.|
PG| ***** 103 ***** |

One other controversial situation--which was discussed earlier section. In the next two examples we look at the 2N bid in 1x-P-P-2N auction as a natural showing a balanced hand with about 19-21 or as an Unusual.|

^-{    When 2NT is Not UNT - Howard Schutzman  continued  }
^-|cs||CP||fp||ht|d|at|The general principle you should use is, assume a NT overcall is natural unless it is obvious it cannot be natural.|
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


AT|

I recommend you play what Bergen calls OBAR (Over Opponents Bid and Raise) 2N. If the opponents bid and raise a suit, then 2N is like a takeout double for the 2 lowest unbid suits. Thus, 1H-P-2H-2N shows clubs and diamonds. Again, I play it only promises 4 cards (but is typically at least 5-4).|
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


AT|

One reasonably common situation where a 2N bid is unusual over any natural strong NT by the opponents. Although it is possible for you to have a strong NT when an opponent has opened a strong NT, it would not be desirable to play 2N when you know an opponent is that strong. In general, you would be much better off defending. Hence, playing 2N as natural over a strong NT is not useful. But playing 2NT over 1N as showing at least 5/5 in the minors can be quite useful and pre-emptive.|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


AT|

Those of you who play DONT might argue that since a 2@C DONT bid shows clubs and another suit (which could be diamonds), there is no need to play 2N as unusual over a strong NT. However, just like 3-level DONT bid (e.g. 1N-3@D) shows a long suit (despite the fact that you can make a DONT double with a 1 -suited hand), playing 2N as unusual even if you play DONT is useful as a pre-emptive tactic. |
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


AT|

A similar situation is 1N-P-2x-2N. That also is unusual. Since the 2x bid is always artificial (Stayman or a transfer), then 2N is unusual. Over a 2@C, 2@D, or 2@H response to 1N, which show major suits, 2N shows 5/5 in the minors. Over 1N-P-2@S-?, you need to be more careful. If the opponents are playing 4-way transfers, which means 2@S definitely shows clubs, then 2N shows hearts and diamonds. However, if 2@S is a transfer to either minor, then it makes no sense for 2N to show both minors, since you know you are getting a very bad break in at least one of your suits. The simplest solution is to play that 2N over such a 2@S bid does not exist. Alternatively, you could play that it shows 5/5 in the majors, but my guess is partner will forget that so it is not worth the risk.|

PG| ***** 114 ***** |


AT|

A direct UNT is an overcall in two suits and, therefore, the hand should hold at least five cards in each of the two lower unbid suits. The better the distribution, the fewer points you need. The quality of the promised two suits is important. |
PG| ***** 115 ***** |

For better understanding let us divide the hand's strength into three categories:|
PG| ***** 116 ***** |

^cHands with less than 10 points-weak or Mini 
^cHands with more than 16 points-strong or Maxi
^cHands with more than 10 and less than 16 points-do something else type.|

The main stream mostly bids UNT with "Mini" and occasionally with "Maxi" hands. |

In Mini category the lower end-assuming good vulnerability-is probably 6 points. For example:|

With two-suited hands in the 10 to 15 points category you should overcall the higher ranking suit. You may get to bid your other suit later. For whatever reasons most partnerships play "Mini"/"Maxi" system.|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |

The conventional wisdom also has it that the 5-5 or better distribution is very important rule that should not be ignored. Next we can view additional examples.

PG| ***** 140 ***** |


UB|2|rh||AH|B4B|mb|1h|lb|*bWhat should South bid now?^^2n|NT|^B@2
After one of the suits opening, South has two options. In a mature partnership an immediate overcall of 4NT would be considered unusual and would get partner to choose a minor suit at the five level. This is very obstructive as it will make life difficult for East/West when they may have a good fit in one of the majors.|
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On the other hand an overcall of 2NT would send the same message-partner I have 5+ in both minors. If North bids only 3@C or 3@D, South can bid again-perhaps simply raising to game or cuebidding to look for a possible slam.|

No is the correct answer. The hand is not suitable for a 2NT overcall. The hand has adequate number of points. However, the minor suits are too weak to make partner bid at the three level. |
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


NT|
Alvin Roth also has a very good point for the UNT bidders, "The Unusual Notrump has one thing in common with natural Notrump openings and direct 1NT overcalls. With normal 5-5 or even 6-5 patterns, you do not have to bid again to confirm your fine distribution and playing strength." |
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


NT|
"Partner heard you the first time. If he permits the opponents to play the hand in spite of your bid, do not overrule him; he is in a far better position to judge how far your side should compete than you are. The exceptions are when you are 6-6 in your two suits or when you have the strong Unusual Notrump hand. Raise his bid on the former and cue bid on the latter."|

He made a 2NT overcall because he has a more distributional hand and a few extra points. As you recall the UNT is a pre-emptive bid too. Please also note the favorable vulnerability.|
