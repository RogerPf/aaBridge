qx|D1,Defending Against Unusual Notrump|ht|b|va|4|fp|1|cp|4|cs|1|at|^-{    1. Defending Against Unusual Notrump    }
^-|FP||ht|d|cs||cp||AT|^B@2The defense against two-suited overcall bids is ingenious and based on the difference between constructive and competitive bidding principles. In competitive bidding, after an overcall, the Opener's partner loses a few of his original options-bids-but gains a few new ones-cuebids of the overcalled suits. For example when the bidding goes 1@S/1@H-(a suit overcall)- now responder can cuebid the overcalled suit -2@S/2@H-to show a limit raise or better.|PG||AT|

The same principle is used in defense against two-suited overcalls. Defending against UNT overcalls is the easier of the two because a jump overcall in Notrump by the opponent ^*Balways^*N shows the two lower unbid suits. Because the two suits are known, therefore, there would be two new cuebids available for the Opener's partner. They are the cuebid of the ^*Blower unbid suit shown^*N (cheaper cuebid) and the cuebid of the next unbid suit, or ^*Bthe higher^*N of the two if you will (the ##2 cuebid).|PG||AT|

Each cuebid has a specific meaning and along with the other options available to the Opener's partner form a solid line of defense. Before we look at a few examples a schematic diagram of the defense lines is in order. It is from Mr. Roth's paper. In our diagram we will start with 1@H-2N-? bidding. You may find it repetitious but trust me it would not hurt to have it pounded in our brains-at least mine :).|PG||NT||

^*BSo there are 2 cue bids available:|PG||ht|j|AT|^*B
The cheaper cuebid = Limit raise or better of Opener's suit (Hearts or Spades).|PG||ht|j|AT|^*B
The cheaper cuebid = Limit raise or better of Opener's suit.|ht|k|at|
The ##2 cuebid = Game force with 5+ cards in the 4th suit (the suit that neither opener nor the opponents have).^*n|PG||AT|

The rest of bids available to the Opener's Partner have the same meaning as in the competitive bidding. We will deal with those shortly.|PG||AT|

Mr. Roth continues, "These treatments and adjustments will help you to counter the Unusual Notrump, but you will not find in them a master key to unlock all doors, for there is none. In practice, we attempt to follow the sage advice of ^*IS. J. Simon^*N, the great British expert, whose philosophy in competitive auctions was '^*BGet the best result possible; not necessarily the best possible result.^*N' We have found that this is good advice in resolving just about all bridge problems."|PG||AT|

A number of experts (Howard included) play the cheaper and ##2 cuebids a bit differently. That is the cheaper cue bid shows the cheaper suit (e.g. 1@S-2N-3@C shows hearts) and the higher cue bid shows the higher suit (e.g 1@S-2N-3@D shows spades).|PG||cp|1|at|

^*BMM^*N :|CP||AT|Next we let Howard outline the differences.|PG||NT||
%%%%%
ht|a|fp|1|cp|4|cs|1|at|^-{    1. Defending Against Unusual Notrump    }
^-|FP||ht|c|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Here is how I play unusual over unusual.|PG||AT|
1) It always applies over unusual 2N (since that shows 2 lower unbid suits) and over club and diamond Michaels bids (where the suits are always both majors). It does not apply over major suit Michaels bids (where the suits are the other major and an unspecified minor).|PG||AT|

2) There are 2 cue bids available. 1 cue bid shows a limit+ raise in opener's suit. The other cue bid shows a game force with 5+ cards in the 4th suit (the suit that neither opener nor the opponents have).|PG||AT|

3) Over the cue bid that shows the limit+ raise, opener's most likely rebids are either 3 or 4 of their suit. Opener would bid 3 with a minimum hand, not enough to go to game opposite a limit raise and 4 when they are strong enough. New suits are control bids, looking for slam.|PG||AT|

4) Over the cuebid that shows the game forcing hand, opener makes an appropriate bid. Opener can just bid game in the 4th suit with 3+-card support. Opener can bid 3 of the 4th suit, which is a slam try, showing 3-card support and more than a min opener (16+). They can also rebid their suit. Cuebids in one of the opponents suits are a slam try in the 4th suit.|PG||AT|

5) ^*BAs to which cue bid means which option. I think it is easier to remember if you play that the lower cue bid shows the lower suit and the higher cue bid shows the higher suit. Thus, over the unusual NT, 3@C shows hearts and 3@D shows spades. For example, if opener started with 1@H, 3@C shows the limit+ raise in hearts and 3@D shows the forcing to game hand with spades. On the other hand, if opener opened 1@S, 3@C shows a game forcing hand with hearts and 3@D shows the limit+ raise in spades.^*n|PG||AT|

Some experts (as outlined earlier) play that the lower cue bid always shows the limit+ raise and the higher cue bid shows the game forcing hand in the 4th suit. There is nothing inherently wrong with playing that way. I just think it is harder to remember. If you play that way, if opener opened 1@H, 3@C shows the limit+ raise in hearts and 3@D shows the game force with 5+ spades (same as the way I play). However, if opener opened 1@S, 3@C shows the limit+ raise in spades and 3@D shows the game force in hearts.|PG||NT||

^-|FP||ht|c|cp|1|at|^*BMM^*N :|CP||AT|Next are a review and a few examples. To show the effect of a two-suited overcall on the competitive bidding, ^*Bthe first few are standard responses to the opening bid without the any overcall^*n. In all we would be playing SAYC as the 2/1 is off after a jump overcall. All the material are from the sources which you can refer to in that section.

In the case of 1@S opening the two suits implied are clubs and diamonds. Thus, the responder (you sitting South) gains ^*Bthe 3@C cuebid-the cheaper cuebid-and 3@D cuebid or ##2 cuebid.^*N|PG||NT|^B@2With those two new bids let us take a look at all the options for Opener's partner. Also a few of the previous bids have different meaning. Let us look at them.|PG||NT||

It also tends to deny support for opener's suit (because then responder would bid #1 cue bid) or length in the 4th suit (because then responder would bid #2 cue bid).|PG||NT|^B@2Further, it sends a strong message that we cannot let them buy the contract undoubled.

^-|FP||ht|d|cp||cs||AT|^B@2The defense against Michaels cuebids is very similar to defending against UNT particularly when both suits are known. However, there may be confusion when one of the two suits promised by the overcaller is unknown (1@H-2@H and 1@S-2@S). The good news, however, is that Opener's partner-in most instances-can bid at the 2 level-a lower level than when UNT is the overcall bid. |PG||AT|

First, let us look at the defense guideline for when both implied suits by the overcaller are known such as in 1@C-2@C and 1@D-2@D-(hearts and spades in both cases). The defense is essentially the same as when the overcall is UNT. To illustrate, therefore, we will use the same pattern as we did for explaining the defense against the UNT. |PG||NT||

Next we have to look at more bidding cycles specific to when partner has opened 1N  follows by a 2N overcall. You will see the bidding with the explanation. No hands :).

Mr. A. Roth opines utilizing these methods enable Opener's partner to locate four-four major suit fits, use transfers when responder has a long major, and penalize 3@C or 3@D when he has good defense against the minors. Other experts may differ.|PG||NT||
