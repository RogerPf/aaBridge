In most instances partner has made an unusual 2NT bid as a pre-emptive or as an obstructive bid. With all considered-outlined above-responder should choose one of the known suits as the trump and make a further obstructive bid by jumping in that suit. Occasionally responder may look for a game or even slam contract with an excellent fit. ^*BBut don't push it^*N.|

South should bid 3@H. North's unusual 2NT overcall shows the two lower-ranking unbid suits-clubs and hearts. South prefers hearts to clubs and bids it at the cheapest available level.|

South Remembers the Law and bids 4@H-North is showing hearts and clubs. If North holds as little as |MD|0,0,S7 HQ T 9 6 4 2 Dt CA J 9 6 4,0|at|the hand shown above there would be game. Further, hopefully it shuts out the opponents who most likely will do well in spades or diamonds.|

4@H is the correct answer. South has only three hearts, but North has at least five. There also are some fitting cards in clubs and the useful @SA.|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't hate the 4@H bid but it is very aggressive and is more likely to go down (due to the only 8-card fit) than not.|

5@C is the best bid for South. Let us look at all the reasons to bid 5@C. South has a nice fit in clubs and some help in hearts, but not many high cards so not much defense against a spade or diamond contract by the opponents.|

4@S is the correct bid. South isn't interested in either of North suits and is going solo-doesn't need much from North to make game. Granted South hand is not a common event!|

North is in a great position. He is off the hook and does not have to strain to bid, he knows what partner has, and his good spades are sitting after the declarer.|

pg| ***** 182 ***** |


mb|d?|NT||sk|n|lb|*bWhat would be a reasonable bid by North?^^4c|mb|4C|NT|^B@2
With an excellent fit in clubs and a partial fit in diamonds, North should be willing to compete in clubs. Based on the Law of Total Tricks, North should be willing to go to at least the four level even with unfavorable vulnerability. However, he can make a more aggressive bid of 5@C particularly with favorable vulnerability. This could pressure East/West to overbid and go down.|
PG| ***** 184 ***** |


sk||NT|^B@2
North/South fare fine in a club contract-making 10 or 11 tricks.|
PG| ***** 185 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Let us give East/West random hands as is shown now|MD|0,st983 hkjt6 dkt2 cq6,0,saqj2 haq9854 d93c5|mb|4hppp|AT| and see how would they do in 4@H contract. Click the forward arrow if you wish to find out.|
PG| ***** 186 ***** |


pf|y|NT|^B@2
You can play this hand double dummy if you wish. If not interested or when you finished the double dummy please click the forward arrow to continue.|
PG| ***** 187 ***** |


PF||NT|^B@2
You also can make other random hands for East/West. Most likely they should take at least 10 tricks in a heart contract.|
PG| ***** 188 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Because, in this board East/West most likely bid on and reach 4@H which makes, therefore, an initial 5@C by North would be a more obstructive bid.|
PG| ***** 189 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now let us make North bid 5@C|ub|5|mb|5cppp|at| and see how would they do in 5@C contract. Again you can play this hand double dummy. But make sure you do not click the forward arrow. With existing distribution, 5@C most likely is down 1. However exchange the @DK with one of East diamonds and 5@C will make with a finesse in diamonds.|pf|y|

The bidding is as shown above. On the first round South decided against overcalling (unfavorable vulnerability and not knowing how West would bid are good reasons).|
PG| ***** 191 ***** |


lb|*yShould South bid now^^Y|NT|^B@2
The answer is a qualified "Yes." Now South is in the balancing position with 9 HCP, East/West have stopped at the two level, North probably has some of the missing strength.|
PG| ***** 193 ***** |


lb|*bWhat should South bid?^^2N|mb|2N|NT|^B@2
2NT by South is unusual in the pass out position even though he didn't jump to 2NT on the first round. Partner should remember what Bergen says, "It is unusual if it is reasonable to be unusual." South cannot be expected to have much strength to bid a natural 2NT.|

PG| ***** 203 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Many experts play the following. Double of 4@S is takeoutish, although on many hands responder can decide to pass, hoping that setting 4@S will work best, especially if responder has a balanced hand. 4NT is a 2-suited takeout with 5/5, but not necessarily the minors. |
PG| ***** 204 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The 4N bidder could be 5/5 in C/D, C/H, or D/H. Therefore, responder should never bid 5@H, and only bid 5@D if he is willing to play 5@H if partner is 5/5 in C/H. You can decide whether or not to put this in the movie. (I play this, BTW, and it has worked well and does come up frequently enough that it is worth playing, unlike the lottery, LOL).|

South can bid either 2N or 4N-depending on his partner and vulnerability. 4N is a more pre-emptive, more obstructive, cleaner bid and reflects the hand better. It quickly takes partnership to either 5@C or 5@D where they belong. BTW, in this position 1N overcall by South is natural showing a balanced hand showing 15 to 18 points.|
