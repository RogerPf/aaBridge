^B@2^*BMM: ^*NThis short tutorial briefly explains Crawling Stayman. You can use Standard Stayman only when you have at least one four card major and more than 7 points. However, responder to a 1N opener may have hands with 7 or less points with certain required distribution. Experts endlessly modify those requirements and name them Garbage Stayman, Crawling Stayman, Junk Stayman, to name a few. Here we look at the Crawling Stayman. Let us look at a few examples. In all the responder's hand is weak @- 7 points or less and 4-4 in majors.

For a comprehensive tutorial on responding to 1N opening please refer to |CP|1|fp|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf-ntauctions, Constructive Auctions after a 1NT Opening Bid^*N|CP||fp||at| at Howard Schutzman's website.|

^*BMM: ^*NHere, you will see the mainstream version of Crawling Stayman which Howard also plays and recommends. We call it Equal Length Crawling Stayman or ELCS. (I will copyright that name so my competitor can not use it.) For those who like to see other modifications please refer to |CP|1|AT|^*Hrfrick.info/bridge/weakstayman.htm ^*N|CP||AT|. It discusses Crawling Stayman for almost any combinations starting with 4-4-4-1. It also has many great bridge gems.|

Howard uses Crawling Stayman with equal length in the majors (any weak 5/5 and 4-4 with 0-7 HCP). For now, let us look at a 4-4-2-3 or 4-4-3-2 distribution first.|

nT|Your 2@H bid is asking opener to pass with better hearts than spades or bid 2@S with better spades than hearts. Notrumper cannot have doubletons in both majors.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even with weak 5-5-2-1 you can bid 2@C (Crawling Stayman) and over a 2@D response bid 2@H and follow as above. If you don't want to bother to play Crawling Stayman, then simply transfer to your better major, and pass when opener accepts the transfer. This works out fine usually. BTW, 5-2 fit plays better than the 4-4 fit. And a 5-3 fit almost always plays better than a 4-4 fit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, if you play Crawling Stayman, the question then is what does 1N-2@H-2@S-3@H show?|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


NT|There are 2 choices.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One is that it shows 5/5 with an invitational hand, giving opener a choice of playing 3@H, 3@S, 4@H, or 4@S. But 5/5 invitational hands are rare, so I think it is better to play that as a 5/5 slam try. |
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Opener bids 3@S if he or she prefers 3@S. Otherwise they make a control bid, which accepts hearts as trump. |
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That means that if it goes 1N-2@H-2@S-3@H-4@C, opener is showing a club control, confirming hearts as trump, but not denying a spade control (3@S would confirm spades as trump and is therefore not available as a control bid.)|
