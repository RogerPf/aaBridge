^-|ht|c|va|4|cs||fp||AT|^B@2Just about every bridge player, including beginners, knows the Stayman convention. Stayman is used by responder to determine if a player who opens 1NT or 2NT holds a major suit. If opener does hold a major, more often than not it is 4 cards in length, and the Stayman convention is structured assuming that opener's length in the major is 4 cards.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

However, sometimes opener holds a 5-card major. Note that modern bridge theory dictates that you should open 1NT with a balanced hand even when you hold a 5-card major. But the downside of that is there is no way for a responder, holding 3 cards in a major, to determine if their side has a 5-3 major suit fit when using Stayman. Puppet Stayman is a modification to Stayman which allows responder to determine whether or not opener's length in his major is 4 cards or 5 cards.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|

You might be wondering why all players don't make a 2@C response to 1NT be Puppet Stayman rather than standard Stayman. It seems that it would be very desirable for responder to be able to discover if their partnership has either a 4-4 or a 5-3 major suit fit. The main reason is that ^*BPuppet Stayman^*n can ^*Bonly^*n be used when responder has a game forcing hand. So there is no way for responder to explore for a major suit fit with an invitational hand. Nor can responder use |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=garbagestayman,Garbage Stayman^*N|CP||FP||at|, where he intends to pass whatever response opener makes, including 2@D. So, up until recently, Puppet Stayman was only used after a 2NT opener (or a 2@C opener followed by a 2NT rebid, that is essentially the same thing). However, these days, some pairs play that a 3@C response to a 1NT opener is Puppet Stayman.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|

If you decide to define a 3@C response to 1NT as Puppet Stayman, then you should note the following. A 2@C response to 1NT is still regular Stayman. But any time the responder has a game-forcing hand and is interested in finding out about a major suit fit (either 4-4 or 5-3), he should bid 3@C (Puppet Stayman) rather than 2@C (regular Stayman). It is always a good idea for the responder to establish a game force as soon as possible. When the responder bids 2@C, it is almost always because he has an invitational hand and wants to find out about a potential 4-4 major suit fit. Rarely, 2@C will be "Garbage Stayman", where the responder has a weak hand and is planning on passing whatever opener responds (including 2@D).|

Should you play Puppet Stayman? I am neutral about it. Even when you have a 5-3 major suit fit, many times 3NT is just as good or even better than playing in 4 of a major. So I don't think it is crucial to find out if opener has a 5-card major after opening 1NT or 2NT. I play Puppet with some partners and regular Stayman with others. And I do prefer using 3@C over 1NT as a slam try. But that is just my style. Puppet is certainly a reasonable convention to play, even over 1NT.|

This is a problem hand. If you bid 3@H as a spade transfer, you must bid 3NT over partner's 3@S response, and you might miss your heart fit. If you bid 3@C, if partner does not hold a major suit, you might miss your 5-3 spade fit. My choice is 3@C. This will get us to the right spot if partner holds either major. And if partner happens to hold 3 spades and less than 4 hearts, 3NT could be just as good a spot as 4@S.

ht|k|at|^B@2
As noted previously, usually when the responder bids 2@C he has only an invitational hand. With a game-forcing hand, the responder bids 3@C. But this example illustrates the one exception where you bid 2@C Regular Stayman with a game forcing hand. It is when you are interested in bidding slam, however, are unsure where to play the hand.

With this hand, you want to play in slam, but you are not sure whether to play in hearts, spades, diamonds, or NT. If opener responds with a major, you will try for slam in that major. If opener denies a major by responding 2@D, you will rebid 3@D. This is natural and 100% game forcing and is usually a slam try. Over 3@D, opener should start control bidding if he has a diamond fit or otherwise bid 3NT. By using this approach, responder will be able to get to the best slam.

^-|ht|c|va|4|cs||fp||AT|^B@2The obvious cases for responder are when opener responds 3@H (5 hearts), 3@S (5 spades), or 3NT (no major longer than 3 cards). Over a 3@H or 3@S response, you raise to 4 if you have at least an 8 card fit (you could have a 9-card fit if you have 4-card support). Otherwise you bid 3NT. Over a 3NT response, you almost always pass (unless you want to explore for slam).|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


AT|

The major complexity with Puppet comes about when opener responds 3@D, showing at least one 4-card major.  Most often, you hold one 4-card major. So you are not sure whether or not your side has an 8-card fit in your major. It turns out that your rebid is the major suit you do not hold. So if you have 4 spades and not 4 hearts, you rebid 3@H over 3@D. Similarly if you have 4 hearts and not 4 spades, you rebid 3@S over 3@D.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


AT|

Why does Puppet Stayman work that way? Just like with transfers and Smolen (for those of you who play it), it allows the strong hand to be declarer, which is more desirable (although its importance overrated by most players). If you rebid 3@S, opener will bid 4@H if he has 4 hearts and will bid 3NT otherwise. Similarly, if you rebid 3@H, opener will bid 4@S if he has 4 spades and will bid 3NT otherwise. Puppet derives its name because of this approach. The Stayman bidder is the "puppet" and the opener is the "master".|

^-|ht|c|va|4|cs||fp||AT|^B@2What about when you hold two 4-card majors? You rebid 4@D. Opener then bids game in whichever 4-card major he holds. If he happens to hold both 4-card majors (meaning your side has two 8-card fits), he normally chooses his stronger major (although on most hands it turns out not to matter which fit he chooses).|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |

This is the basic approach and what I suggest you play until you are very comfortable with Puppet Stayman. Once you get used to Puppet Stayman, there are two optional extensions you could play (although it is perfectly fine if you decide not to play them):|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


AT|

1) If the Stayman bidder rebids 3@H over 3@D (which shows a 4-card spade suit), opener should rebid 3@S rather than 4@S. That way, if partner has slam interest, he can start control bidding.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


AT|

2) If the Stayman bidder has both majors and some slam interest, he rebids 4@C rather than 4@D. If opener has no slam interest, he then simply bids 4 of his major suit. If opener is interested in slam, it gets a bit more complicated. He wants to bid Roman Key Card (RKCB), but responder does not know which suit is trump. To solve that problem, if opener bids 4NT over 4@C, that is RKCB for spades. If he bids 4@D, that is RKCB for hearts.|

Although you don't have a major suit fit, your side has at least 33 HCP, enough to be in slam. Bid 4@C Gerber to ask for aces. If your side is not missing 2 aces, bid 6NT.

^-|ht|c|va|4|cs||fp||AT|^B@2To summarize, Puppet Stayman allows you to find out if the NT opener has either a 4-card major or a 5-card major. That way you can play in both your 4-4 and 5-3 major suit fits. The major disadvantage of Puppet Stayman is that you can only bid it with a game forcing hand.|

Here are my recommendations regarding Puppet Stayman:

1) I am neutral as to whether or not you should play Puppet Stayman. The obvious advantage is it allows you to find your 5-3 major suit fits. However, it is often the case that 3NT plays just as well or even better than 4 of a major even when you have a 5-3 fit. It is also more complicated.|

2) To start with, only play it when partner opens 2NT or when partner opens 2@C and rebids 2NT.|

3) Once you get used to Puppet Stayman, you can decide to play that a 3@C bid over 1NT is Puppet Stayman. Note that you can only bid 3@C with a game forcing hand. You still bid 2@C as regular Stayman with an invitational or |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=garbagestayman,Garbage Stayman^*N|CP||FP||at| hand. Note that the most common treatment is to only play Puppet Stayman over 2NT and not play it over 1NT.|
