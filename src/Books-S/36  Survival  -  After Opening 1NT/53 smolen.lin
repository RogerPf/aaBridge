at|^b@2|at|^^|cp||at|^b^^^*bPrinciple of the Concept^*n^^|n^|7|
at|^b@2|at|^^|cp||at|^bHowever, if the response by the NT bidder is 2@d, denying a 4-card Major suit, then a situation has occurred. In the generally accepted continuance the responder must now bid the longer Major suit to show at least a 5-card Major suit. When this occurs, then the transfer advantage has been lost and the weaker of the 2 holdings becomes the declarer hand. Instead of concealing certain tenaces, such as King-Jack or Ace-Queen, these tenaces are revealed to the defenders, providing them with additional defense advantages.|
at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^b@2|at|^^|cp||at|^bWhen the partnership includes and employs Smolen Transfer bids, designed specifically for this situation, then the responder will jump to the 3 level in a Major suit. This initiates the Smolen and the NT bidder now has the information that partner holds game values. It is this jump which shows a 4-card suit in the suit bid and either a 5-card or a 6-card suit in the other Major suit. In this manner the NT bidder becomes the declarer, which is the intention of this conventional method. |
