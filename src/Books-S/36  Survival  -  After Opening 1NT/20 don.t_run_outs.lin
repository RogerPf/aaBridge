This tutorial is based on Howard Schutzman's teaching as outlined in his article:
|CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/WeakNTPart3.pdf^*N|CP||at|

There have been various Runouts schemes invented over the years, but the DONT Runouts (which Howard Schutzman |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/^*N|CP||AT| and Marty Bergen |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.martybergen.com/^*N|CP||AT| independently invented are the simplest to play. Notable quotes from other sources have been added. It is based on the DONT convention played by many pairs when competing over 1NT opening bids. The approach is, therefore, named "^*BDONT Runouts^*N". It lets you to find the best place to play when the opponents have doubled or overcalled your partner's 1NT opening bid. The method applies whether the double/overcall is made directly or by responder's right hand opponent.|

ht|t|at|As most already know the double after 1N is either for penalty, reasonably rare, or is a convention such is DONT or others. To use DONT Runouts, do we need to know the double we are dealing with? Not really. We can play DONT Runouts even if RHO's double is not penalty (for example, showing a single suited hand). Let us quote from Larry Cohen in  |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.larryco.com/bridge-learning-center/detail/42^*N|CP||AT|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|With the strong NT, when the opponents overcall I recommend that you play "^*BSystems on and stolen bid doubles^*n". This means that all bids by responder retain the same meaning as if there had been no overcall, and a double means "the opponent made the bid I wanted to make (^*Bhe 'stole' my bid)^*n". This is a very simple and effective approach.

However, with the weak NT, it is more likely the points are evenly divided between the two sides, and you need more flexibility in competing for part scores. Therefore, I recommend you play the Lebensohl convention if you play weak 1N openers. It is somewhat more complicated than systems on, but it is a lot more flexible.|CP|1|AT|

The overcalls, if any, most often, could be 2@C, 2@D, 2@H or 2@S. We discussed the double in the last section. We will outline the "Systems on Stolen Bid" arrangement to treat each overcall. Please note that this arrangement won't always work well with every possible hand. So a healthy dose of judgement and an alert partner would be very helpful. Further, please note that there are many other similar arrangements which you can choose.|

^*BAfter a 2@C Overcall^*N
Partner opens 1N and our RHO overcalls 2@C which is alerted showing either a one-suited or two-suited type of hand. As you see we are only robbed of 2@C Stayman. So depending on our hand:

^CWe can pass if we have nothing to say,
^CWe can bid 2@D, 2@H, and 2@S to transfer to Hearts, Spades and Minors respectively. ^*BSystems on^*N,

Bid 2@s transfer to minors. Assuming you play 2@S over 1NT is a minor suit transfer (e.g. the 1NT bidder bids 3@C over 2@S and responder passes or corrects to 3@D - in this case), 2@S is still a minor suit transfer.
