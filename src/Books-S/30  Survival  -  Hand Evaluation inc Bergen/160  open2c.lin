^-|FP||VA|4|AT|^B@2All one level opening bids have range of strength up to 21 points and are not forcing. Responder may and can pass with less than 6 points. There are hands, however, so strong (22+) that game is likely even if responder has fewer than 6 points. Therefore, responder cannot pass. All such strong hands are opened with an artificial, forcing 2@C.  |

In this simple synopsis we look at only two methods.|

AT| 

A. You open 2@C a 22+ unbalanced hand when you have 9+ tricks in your hand (preferred by Howard Schutzman).|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


AT|

B. You open 2@C a 22+ unbalanced hand using Bergen's Method when it satisfies his "4 and 4" rule.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


AT|

Method A is straightforward. All you need is counting your tricks. If there are 9 then open 2@C. One important note. Open a hand 1@D when the longest suit is diamond and you have 9 tricks. Howard will address that later.|

^-|FP||VA|4|AT|^B@2^*BMM: ^*NThis section is provided by Howard Schutzman. More on this topic at the end of this presentation by Tommy Solberg.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Marty Bergen uses the "4 and 4" rule when determining whether or not to open 2@C when your long suit is a major. The "4 and 4 rule" states you should open 2@C when your hand contains at least 4 quick tricks and has no more than 4 losers.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


AT|

Counting your quick tricks is easy. There are only 5 holdings you need to consider. AK = 2  quick tricks, A = 1 quick trick, KQ = 1 quick trick, AQ = 1.5 quick tricks, and Kx = .5 quick trick.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


AT|

Counting losers the way Bergen intended is more difficult. You do not use the common Losing Trick Count method to determine losers. You count what you expect to be your actual losers in the suit, based on an average length (with no high cards or help) in partner's hands. |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


AT|

Sometimes counting losers is fairly easy. For example, if you hold AKQxxxx, that is no losers; since there are 6 cards out, on average partner will hold 2, so you will rarely lose any tricks in that suit. Even AKQxxx can be considered zero losers; with 7 cards missing, partner on average will have slightly over 2 cards in the suit, and with an 8 card fit, if the suit breaks 3-2, you will have no losers. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


AT|

As another example, Axxx is a  3 loser suit, because partner on average will have 3 cards in the suit, but a 3-3 break is not likely. You can consider AQ a half loser suit (you may or may not lose a trick depending on which defender  has the King). |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


AT|

Similarly Kx is a 1.5 loser suit (which defender has the A determines whether or not you will lose 2 tricks). KQx is 1.5 losers (whether you lose 1 or 2 tricks depends on where the A is located).  KQ doubleton is one loser.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NNext we will have responding to 2@C opener. |

qx|Resp,wide|bt||cs|6|ht|b|fp|1|at|^-{           Responding to 2@C Opening          }
^-|FP||VA|4|AT|^B@2^*BMM: ^*NAgain, there are many schemes for responding to 2@C, but we review only the 2@D waiting which is the most popular and straightforward. Responder may have range of hands from a few points to enough that slam is likely. One point is clear. If partner opens 2@C, responder may not pass below game except if it goes 2@C-P-2@D-P-2N, and even then only with 0 to a bad 2 and no 5-card major. Basically 2@C establishes a game force. There are other rare occasions, we will look at them later, when with less than 3 points responder may pass below game. |
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


AT|

Adopting 2@D waiting response, responder bids 2@D first then for his second response, with a good hand he makes a positive bid and with three points or less he makes a negative bid.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


AT|

Responder, using an adjunct scheme, can bypass initial 2@D response when his hand is strong enough where he would have made a positive second bid after a 2@D waiting first bid. An initial positive response requires 8+ points. Those first positive response are 2@H, 2@S, 2N 3@C, or 3@D. 2N shows a balanced hand.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


AT|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NHoward has additional note regarding initial response of 3@C or 3@D, "I would tend to avoid bidding 3@C or 3@D over a 2@C opener, even if responder has the requirements to do so (5-card suit with 2 of top 3 or 6+ card suit with 2 of top 4). It takes up too much room. Bidding 2@D and then hearing why opener opened 2@C usually results in a much better auction."|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |

Next, let us put a spot light on couple important issues by looking at some examples.|

PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT|^B@2  
A positive first bid in a suit, beside promising 8+ points, requires a 5-card suit - 2 of the top 3 honors or a 6-card or longer suit with 2 of the top four honors. It also commits the partnership to at least game in that suit and shows interest in reaching slam. |

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|2N is a good option. But I like 2@D better because that makes it likely that the stronger hand will be declarer and also keeps the bidding at a lower level. Slam is likely when you hold 10 HCP and partner opens 2@C. |

PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With a balanced 8+ points hand the first positive response is 2N.|MB|2N|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
On the other hand, this is not played by many experts as it takes up bidding room. Therefore, the first positive response of 2N is reserved only for balanced hands of about 8-12 points populated mostly by Queens and Jacks with no more than one ace or king. However, Howard has the next point which again supports bidding 2@D with this hand.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT||
cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Some people play you should only bid 2N with 3 or more "controls". You count 2 controls for an ace and 1 control for a king. So, if you play that way, a 2NT response guarantees at least 1 ace and 1 king or 3 kings. I think this is a better way to play than the way suggested, where the 2N bid denies controls. With a lack of controls, 2@D is a better bid.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |

BTW, the auction develops naturally when responder makes a positive response after the 2@C opening either on the first round or the second round. |

PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT||
NT|^B@2
On the other hand, by rebidding 2N which no longer is forcing, opener has limited his hand to 22-24 range and game is not possible opposite a very weak hand. Therefore, this is another rare bidding sequence where, with less than 3 points, responder can pass. Let us see an example.|

Same thing (even worse) when opener has diamonds (2@C-2@D-3@D). It is often better to make a slight underbid by opening 1@C or 1@D.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss the 3@C bid and the way some people show a "bust" hand as responder over 2@C. There are a few alternatives. One is to not worry about showing a bust hand. The other is to play that 2@D over 2@C promises at least 1 ace or king and with no aces or kings responder bids 2@H. The problem I have with that approach is that sometimes wrong sides the contract when the 2@C bidder has hearts. so I don't particularly care for that approach although it is reasonably popular.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I play something called "2nd negative" which means if it goes 2@C-2@D-2@H or 2@S-?, a 3@C rebid by responder shows a bust hand (no aces or kings). For example if I were playing with one of my regular partners I could not bid 3@C with East's hand. That is obviously a problem on this hand. But I have found that you usually have a reasonable alternative, such as 2N or raising. As you know responder with a bust can pass a 2N rebid by opener.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Therefore, I would have to bid 2N with East's hand (or 3@D perhaps). To think about it, actually with East's hand I might even bid 3@H with my 2 honors. The 2@C bidder almost always has a 6 card suit or a good 5 card suit. With @HK10 I would guess (and be wrong on this hand) that the 2@C bidder has a 6 card suit. But if you don't play 2nd negative, then 3@C is obviously the best bid. |
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT|^B@2
BTW, 2nd negative is not standard. I am not sure there is a standard. Basically if playing with an unfamiliar pard, I would assume they are playing nothing, but I would avoid bidding 3@C even with a bust hand. For now we let 3@c stand and go through the rest of the bidding.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now let me critique the entire bidding. West certainly has a 2@C opener. The question is what should she bid over 2@D? Bidding 2@H is a reasonable alternative. But because her heart suit is rather weak (no intermediate cards, 10, 9, 8) and only 2 honors I might choose to bid 2N. Also that right sides the contract if responder has either 4 card major. |
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT|^B@2
They might occasionally miss a 5-3 heart fit. But in general, if you have a bid that resembles a NT bid that narrows down your point range and distribution you should strongly consider making it. In fact, even with a 5 card major, I will sometimes over call 1NT with 15-18 if I have a good stopper and a so-so 5 card suit. NT bids narrowly define your hand and make it much more likely that your side will get to the best spot.|

Some experts like to play "Puppet Stayman" which allows responder to discover if opener has either a 4-card major or a 5-card major. However, discussing Puppet Stayman is outside the scope of this presentation.

The 2N by South is not forcing with a 22-24 HCP range. With 1 HCP North has no hope for game anywhere. So a pass is prudent. This one of two occasions that responder can pass after 2@C bid without reaching game. We will see the other soon.|mb|p|

                    2 club overuse syndrome

In June of 2009 I led (more or less) a discussion about when to open 2 clubs. The discussion centered around 2 hands sent to me by a reader. Rather than simply respond, I asked my readers to select the appropriate opening bid. The hands were:

|HT|m|at|^c  {|ih|pSSKQ432 HQ DAQ32 CAKT|at|}|ht|o|at|^mand |ht|m|at|^p  {|ih|pSSAQ876 HAKT2 DAQJ C2|at|}|
PG| ***** 143 ***** |

I got a lot of varied responses. The only things the responses had in common were that none of them were equivocal and all lacked any discussion of standards that would be useful to my blog readers in the heat of battle. Almost everyone vilified hand one [hand on the left] as a perfect example of abuse and overuse of the 2 club opening bid. Hand 2 [right hand] gained more support and there was almost an even balance between 1 spade and 2 clubs.|
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


AT|

Always practical and useful, enter Marty Bergen who has it all figured out and reveals his answer in depth in Chapter 4 of Slam Bidding Made Easier (2008), my summer beach book. His standard for opening 2 clubs is based on a combination of Quick Tricks and Losers (tricks you would expect to lose if partner shows up with no help at all).|
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Note that there is a distinct difference between the concept of "losing tricks" in opener's hand and "Losing Trick Count." Losing Trick Count (see my earlier blogs) is a valuable valuation tool when a fit has been established with partner, but of dubious value when there has been no bidding.|
PG| ***** 146 ***** |


AT|

Most of you know the definition of Quick Tricks since it has been around from the early days of Bridge. A=1, AK= 2, Kx= ½, AQ= 1 ½ KQ=1. That's it, and there can only be a maximum of 2 Quick Tricks in each suit.|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


AT|

Now you are ready for the Bergen Gold Standard:

(a) If the hand is balanced (4333 or 4432) open 2 clubs only if you have 22 high card points. Opener intends to rebid 2NT.

(b) If the hand is semi-balanced (5332) or unbalanced only open if the hand has 4 or fewer losers and the hand also has 4 or more quick tricks. Thus in Marty speak, "4+4." Astute observers and mathematicians may point out that if you have only 4 losers, the hand also has 9 winners. Does that standard sound familiar?|
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


AT|

Marty is not going to open either Hand 1 or 2 with 2 clubs [repeated below]. They both meet the 4 quick trick requirement but also have too many losing tricks.

Open 1 heart. 5 quick tricks, but at least 5 losers. The hand should also be downgraded for the singleton A of spades. Aces that are not supported with other honors in the suit or are in short suits have diminished value. If you don't have firm control of the trump suit, you also run the risk of a "pumping defense" in spades.|

Open 2 clubs. Marty sez any hand with 6+ quick tricks is too strong to open with 1 spade or 1 heart.|

What is the downside of the "2 club overuse syndrome?" In three words, "loss of communication." You are starting the auction on the 2 level and by the time you get through with responses and rebids, it is no trick at all to be on the 3 level and not know much more than you did when you first sorted the cards. If your hand is one that deserves to play in game no matter what partner has, then opening 2 clubs is an effective way to tell him that. You don't need a lot of bidding room. If your hand is not that strong, then give yourself the optimum opportunity to gain helpful information from partner by a one level opening.|
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


AT|

What? Worried about getting passed out? Trust me, in this day and age good partners are looking for reasons to bid, not reasons to pass. Even if partner does not have a minimum bid, the chances are very good that the opponents will either overcall or balance. This sucker is not going to die, and on the rare occasion when it does, you are probably in the right spot.|
PG| ***** 162 ***** |


AT|

So what do we have? Marty Bergen who said "Bridge is a Bidder Game" rejects the current fad to reduce standards for forcing 2 club opening bids and goes traditional on us. When you have one of the World's most aggressive bidders saying "Pull in your horns", maybe it is time to listen. So consider making 4+4 your partnership standard.|
