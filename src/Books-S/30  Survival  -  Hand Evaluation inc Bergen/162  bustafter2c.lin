^B@2^z@3What would be your rebid?|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT| First let us set the standards used for this Survival Kit tool.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|

^*BA. We consider 2@C opening an absolute forcing bid and responder, in absence of interference, should bid even with zero HCP.
B. The responder's first bid is always 2@D (waiting) regardless of the hand's strength.^*N|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|I prefer the 3@C as the negative bid over a 2@H or 2@S rebid. It does very occasionally give responder an awkward problem when he has a good hand with clubs and no support for partner's suit. But even if that happens, most often the contract ends up in opener's suit anyway so no real harm is done if responder is forced to either underbid 3@C, bid 2N, or raise with 2-card support.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


AT|

Therefore, using Howard's standard, your bid in either case with that real gem of a hand is 3@C.|cs||cp||fp||ht|f|cp||cs|6|at|^B {|ia|,2cp2dp2sp3c|at|}|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


ht|v|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Responder should only bid 3@C when he has no aces or kings, fewer than 6 HCP, and less than 3-card support for opener's suit. If he has a weak hand but 3+ card support he should jump to 4 of a major. Thus the auction 2@C-2@D-2@H-4@H is an example of "fast arrival" showing a weak hand with heart support. The auction 2@C-2@D-2@H-3@H shows that responder has a stronger hand with at least 1 ace or king or 6+ HCP (slow arrival) and is potentially interested in slam.|

In Bridge World Standard, the 3@C rebid distinguishes a really bad hand from one with a little something. The double-negative rebid allows the bidding to stop at three of opener's original major suit. Responder shows values by bidding anything else. With a natural club bid, the best he can do is stall with two notrump. With support for opener's major, he can raise directly (a double raise shows strong trumps, and little else) or jump in a short suit, a splinter raise.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NWe used the examples in Quiz 2 from The Bridge World as the template with Howard making the necessary corrections. You may find out that in some instances Howard does not agree with the information offered by The Bridge World. Please note responding to 2@C with a good hand is not being discussed here. However. not all the responder's hands are as bad as we have here. Those are what we will be focusing on next.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NBefore we complete this work let us ask Howard what is "2@C strong, 2@H bust" some players in BBO have on their profile.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|In the past and even now, some people liked the idea of responder being able to still show a really bad hand, and played 2@H as the "negative" or "bust" bid. I played that for many years, and it is still played by many.

The main problem with playing 2H shows a bust hand is when the 2@C bidder's suit is hearts. The contract is wrong sided (e.g. the weak hand ends up as declarer because of the artificial 2@H bid). And the auction gets too high too fast. The auction starts 2@C-2@H-3@H, where 3@H is the first natural bid and the 2@H bid has preempted the partnership. On that auction you are pretty much committed to playing 4@H and have little chance of getting to 3N when that is the best contract. It is because of this problem that I strongly prefer not to play 2H as showing a bust hand.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


AT|

A second problem with playing 2@H shows a bust is when responder has a nice heart suit (5+ cards with 2 of the 3 top honors). Some pairs play that a 2N bid is used to show that hand. The problem is, when opener has spades, he has to show them at the 3-level, taking up valuable bidding room. Others play that you simply bid 2@D over 2@C with that hand and show the hearts later.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


AT|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NI understand the 2@C opener is rather uncommon and such a hand facing a bust hand is also uncommon. However, I cannot help it not to give you a great article by another expert. His article follows a different path but he finally gets to 3@C bid for a bust hand. ^*BGooseprickles^*N will run on your skin when you realize how much the two experts agree with each other. The only difference is one expert has the best Movie Maker ever working for him. Some of the boards, though they come from two different sources, resemble each other.  Let us briefly review his article.|

^B@2^*BMike Lawrence: ^*N|cp||at|You are the dealer and with a strong two clubs, you start with that. "Do you have agreements on what partner's various bids mean? For instance, what would partner show if he bids 2@D or 2@H or 2NT? What does he have if he bids 3@C or 3@D?"|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


AT|

"There are many ways to respond to a two club bid. You can show your points by bidding in steps. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


AT|

You can show controls artificially. |
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


AT|

You can play that 2@D shows six or more points and 2@H shows a true bust.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


AT| 

Or, you can play that 2@D says only that you do not have a descriptive bid to make. You may have some points, but no way to show them now. On hands where you have a bust, you will show that fact on the second round. 

This last method is by far the easiest to play and since it has a lot of merit, I will use it as the guideline for the four hands shown next."|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |

In the next four examples where the bidding is 2@C-P-?, Mr. Lawrence opines that 2@D response By FAR is the best. Let us take a look.|

^B@2^*BMike Lawrence: ^*N|cp||at|Bid two diamonds. You do not have a suit to show. The only bid you have to show points is two notrump. In this regard, I recommend you NEVER bid two notrump in response to an opening two club bid. It takes away bidding room, plus it can make the wrong hand declarer. Respond two diamonds and leave opener room to show his hand.|

^B@2^*BMike Lawrence: ^*N|cp||at|Even with this fine a hand, start with two diamonds. I offer the strong suggestion that you do not bid two notrump to show points. Bidding two notrump takes up important bidding room. You will do better by bidding two diamonds, which lets opener start to show his hand, and then you can make a forward-going bid on the next round. 

Truly, I hate bidding two notrump and I hate hearing partner bid it. You can find players who do bid two notrump and who claim that it solves some of their problems, but it has yet to solve any for me. Usually, it just gets in the way of our bidding.|

^B@2^*BMike Lawrence: ^*N|cp||at|Finally, a hand that should not bid two diamonds. Bid two spades. This bid promises a biddable suit and usually six points or more. The only question is, how good a suit do you promise? Some play that any two of the top three honors in a five card suit is OK. I think that might be restrictive. KJxxx or even QJxxx makes sense. K10xxx and A10xxx need to be discussed.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*N In the next examples, Mr Lawrence looks at opener's response. He ask the readers, "How does partner tell you that he has a genuinely bad hand? What do 2@S, 2NT, 3@C, 3@D, 3@H, and 4@H show?" In all examples the opener's hand stays the same but responder's hand changes.|

By bidding two notrump, you tell partner you aren't broke, and then when you go back to hearts, you will imply you have support points but not good ones. Say your partner rebids three notrump or bids three diamonds over two notrump. Now you can jump to game in hearts, giving the message that you have something but no enthusiasm.

^B@2^*BMike Lawrence: ^*N|cp||at|Bid three clubs, telling partner you have nothing. As the auction progresses, you will keep returning to hearts. Having warned partner that you are broke, you won't have to worry that he will get excited.|MB|3c|

^B@2^*BMike Lawrence: ^*N|cp||at|If your current solution is to bid four hearts, your partner will have to guess whether you have this worthless hand or the hand shown earlier, Hand 2 (108543, 7643, Q8, 92), which is a bad hand but a bad hand with some redemption. 

The last three Expert Tricks let you show more about your hand than the normal method, which is not very informative.|
