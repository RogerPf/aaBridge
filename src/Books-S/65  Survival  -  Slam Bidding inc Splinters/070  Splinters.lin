The most common splinter bids are by responder after partner opens 1 of a major and no interference by the opponents. A splinter bid shows:

4+ trumps support
13-16 Dummy Points 
Singleton or void in bid suit
You can bid splinter if your singleton is an ace.
With a stronger hand and 4+ trumps support you bid Jacoby 2N even with a singleton or void

You can recognize a splinter bid because it is:|

A jump one past a reverse or jump shift.|

With 20 points and support for responder's suit, opener can bid splinter if he has shortness somewhere else. It is also a bid 1 past a jump shift or reverse.|

^c@2^Y@34@D is the correct bid. The singleton Ace may be a concern for some. First, this is still 13-16 dummy points with a singleton. Some people recommend against a splinter bid here. But Bergen feels you can still splinter with a singleton Ace. So, he would recommend you bid 4@D with this hand. Bergen feels the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. I have no experience yet to say whether I agree or not, but when in doubt I tend to go with Bergen's opinions. He rarely steers you wrong.

^c@2^Y@32N is the correct bid. Remember, Bergen recommends that you only splinter with 13-16 dummy points. So 2N is the correct bid.

^c@2^Y@34@D is the correct answer.

First of all, we need to agree that South should splinter in diamonds. 3@D  bid is not a splinter, merely a game try in hearts, with diamond cards. Partner does not know South has such a good hand, since 1@H can be made on 6 points. Therefore, 4@D is a diamond splinter, since it is an "unnecessary jump." As to whether you are too strong. The hand is worth 17 declarer points. However, partner is limited to 16, so in this case, a 4@D bid is warranted, because you are not really taking up too much room. What you are trying to convey is interest in slam if diamond shortness is valuable. Without the diamond shortness, slam would be extremely unlikely.

^c@2^y@34NT is the correct bid. Remember, once you know you have all suits controlled, you can bid 4N. As Bergen says, "he who knows, goes." 4@D bid really improves your hand, you have all other suits controlled so might as well bid 4N, no need to do more control bids.

^c@2^y@34@H is the correct answer. The KQ of diamonds are essentially 5 wasted points, so 4@H is the bid. On bad days, 4@H might even go down.

^c@2^y@34@h is the correct answer. First remember that 4@C means pard has 4 spades, 20+ dummy points, and club shortness. So, slam is quite possible. the only fly in the ointment is that you might have 2 diamond losers. So, you bid 4@H. partner knows that you are interested in slam, but don't have a diamond control. Partner will bid 4@S with no diamond control, otherwise 4N or another control bid with a diamond control. Therefore, your 4H conveys the exact message you want to send.

^c@2^y@34@S is the correct answer. Even though this hand has more HCP than the last hand, it is not nearly as good based on the auction. Your club points are wasted, so 4@S is the bid.

^c@2^y@34NT is correct, as you have an ideal diamond holding and control of all suits.

HT|S|AT|^c@2^z@3I am sure you noticed that Hands 4-27 and 4-28 are indeed the same hand. |CP||AT|The difference is in the auction. In 4-27, the auction goes 1@H-1@S-4@C, which devalues the 1@S bidder's hand quite a bit, due to the club points. In 4-28, the auction goes 1@H-1@S-4@D, which improves the value of the 1@S bidder's hand quite a bit, since he has only small diamonds (the J is not worth much). So, in 4-27, the 1@S bidder should simply close out in game by bidding 4@S. In 4-28, the 1S bidder should look for slam. He can do that by either bidding 4@H (control bid), or jumping right to 4N, since he knows that all suits are controlled (partner has diamonds controlled, and he has hearts and clubs controlled)|
