bt||ht|a|va|4|fp|1|cp|1|at|^-  Responding to RKCB with a Void  
^-|ht|b|cp||va|4|fp||AT|^B@2This tutorial is prepared by Kia (BBO nickname "nome"), aka ^*BMovie Maker^*N under ^*BHoward Schutzman^*N, (BBO nickname hondo717") supervision. Further,it is assumed that you are well versed in slam bidding and with RKCs structure. Before, you learn the tools in how to respond to 4NT with a void you need to strictly observe the following:|
PG| ***** 0 ***** |


fp|2|cs|6|va|4|AT|
{  You make sure the void is useful (not duplicated by the ace).  }|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


va|4|AT|
{  You ignore the void if partner has bid the suit naturally.  }|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


va|4|AT|
{  You ignore void if you have no agreement with your partner  }
|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |

Howard teaches the the following scheme for responding to 4NT with a void. It is independent of type of RKC you are playing.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


ht|l|at|^b{ |ht|z|at|^z
^z  }|HT|m|at|^c@2^Y@3a) Do not show the void if you feel your hand is weaker than partner has a right to expect--no ace.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


 
HT|m|at|^c@2^Y@3a) Do not show the void if you feel your hand is weaker than partner has a right to expect--no ace.|
HT|o|at|^C@2^Y@3b) With an odd number of key cards, you bid 6 of your void suit. If your void suit is higher than the trump suit (e.g. you have a spade void and hearts are trump), you bid 6 of the trump suit (otherwise you would have to bid 7).|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


HT|m|at|^c@2^Y@3a) Do not show the void if you feel your hand is weaker than partner has a right to expect--no ace.|
HT|o|at|^C@2^Y@3b) With an odd number of key cards, you bid 6 of your void suit. If your void suit is higher than the trump suit (e.g. you have a spade void and hearts are trump), you bid 6 of the trump suit (otherwise you would have to bid 7).|
HT|r|at|^C@2^Y@3c) With an even number of Key Cards, you bid 5N.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


HT|m|at|^c@2^Y@3a) Do not show the void if you feel your hand is weaker than partner has a right to expect--no ace.|
HT|o|at|^C@2^Y@3b) With an odd number of key cards, you bid 6 of your void suit. If your void suit is higher than the trump suit (e.g. you have a spade void and hearts are trump), you bid 6 of the trump suit (otherwise you would have to bid 7).|

ht|u|at|^c@2^Z@3The other scheme which depends on Regular Blackwood and type of RKCs played is outside the scope of this tutorial.

md|3,,S Q 876 H Q J 76 D A Q J 54 C-,|sv|b|mb|1DP1HP?|lb|*bWhat should North bid?^^3h|nt|^B@2
3@H is the correct bid. With four-card support for South's suit, North can re-evaluate the hand. Using Bergen Hand Evaluation North has 17 Dummy Points. 12 HCP, 4 points for the void (the number of trump held by dummy), 1 length point, and 1 for the quality diamond suit. You subtract one for adjust 3. That's enough to make a jump raise to 3@H.

mb|p?|NT||lb|*yShould North count the void as a second Keycard when responding?^^n|NT|^B@2
Although a void serves the same purpose as an Ace in a trump contract, as a first-round control, don't count it as a Keycard when responding to 4NT. To see why, let us see what South could hold.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


md|0S5 HAK543 DK3 CAKJ98,0,0,0|NT|^B@2
Since South had the first two ingredients for slam, he jumped to 4NT, to check for Keycards. If North responds 5@S, treating the club void as a second Keycard, what might South be tempted to do?|SB|SI will Bid 7H.|mb|5s|AN|2 Keycards+ Trump Queen|

NT|^B@2
From South perspective, the partnership holds all of the Keycards. Therefore, bidding a grand slam has merit. However, as you can see it would not be a great success! They are missing @SA.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Counting a void, however, as a Keycard when responding to 4NT always doesn't work well. You need to have an agreement with your partner before showing a void when responding to 4NT. From all the possible agreement, simply ignoring voids completely might be a good decision. |

6@H is the correct bid. The jump to the six level in the agreed trump suit shows one Keycard and a higher-ranking void. In this situation, South will know the void is in spades.

The correct bid, playing 1430, is 5@C. Simply show one Keycard. The club void isn't likely to be useful, since clubs is one of South's suits.

7@H. South's response has shown one Keycard and a higher-ranking void. South must hold the @CA and a void in spades. There shouldn't be any losers in a 7@H contract, since the spade losers can be ruffed in the dummy.
