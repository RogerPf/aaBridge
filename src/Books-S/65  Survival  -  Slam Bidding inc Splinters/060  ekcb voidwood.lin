    One of my pet peeves is that 1430 was foisted upon the bridge playing public with very little reason.

^-{
            The whole world seems to have gone 1430 in their RKCB responses, which is fine by us.            
But, playing Exclusion you should go back to 3014 responses.
Yes, it’s confusing, but Exclusion takes up so much space that
the Exclusion bidder is usually interested in only one or two cards.
When responder has neither of them, he is apt to take the bidding
too high if he sticks with 1430.

To try for slam when your hand has a void and you need to ask about Key Cards, you need Exclusion Key Card Blackwood (EKB) or Voidwood convention.|qx|B, beginning|AT| As usual in bridge it comes in several different flavors. The main difference between them is whether partnership uses response steps similar to 0314, or 1430, or standard Blackwood. This presentation covers EKB only when the trump suit is a major and partnership response scheme is patterned after 0314 Roman Key Card. For other flavors please refer to the links provided at the end. Also, as you noticed in the opening page the assault on 1430 RKC is on -:).

After Major Suit Agreement
The Basics}
^-|FP||AT|^B@2
Slam hands with a void suit are difficult to bid. It is wrong to use regular or RKC Blackwood because you have to guess which one of the Key Cards reported by partner may be the ace you are void in that suit. A simple treatment for this situation is Exclusion Key Card Blackwood (EKB) particularly when a major is the established trump suit. Only established partnerships should consider EKB for the slam in minors.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|

Let us assume you have established the trump suit, ready to determine how many Key Cards your partnership has, and you have a void in a suit. First, because of void, there are only ^*Bfour Key Cards^*N (the other 3 Aces and the King of trump) or three aces if you play regular Blackwood. A jump bid (a bid above the game) in the suit you have a void is EKB. |
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|

The jump bid is usually 5@C, 5@d, 5@H, or 4@S if the trump suit is a major. It can be 4@H or 4@S if the trump suit is a minor which we are not addressing it here. The following examples will illustrate the bidding sequence. In all examples, assume the 3-level bid ^*Bestablishes the trump suit, you have a void, and partnership is looking for a possible slam contract in a major^*N.|

Responding}
^-|FP||AT|^B@2By jumping above the game level ( mostly to the five level), one of the partners announces his interest in slam. He is void in a suit (the one which he jumped in). And asks partner for number of Key Cards ^*BOUTSIDE^*N the void suit. Responder to the EKB counts his aces or Key Cards outside the void suit and responds using a scheme similar to steps used responding to either 4NT if partnership was playing regular Blackwood, or RKC 1430, or RKC 0314. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


AT|

Some partnerships who play 1430 RKCB prefer, for consistency, to also play 1430 EKCB. And you certainly can do that. However, it is preferable that you play EKCB 0314 because that means you make a lower bid with fewer key cards. For example, consider the auction 1@S-3@S-5@H (EKCB with a heart void). If you play 1430, then you are pretty much committed to playing at least 6@S because with 0 key cards partner would bid 5NT (0 or 3 key cards). However, if you play 0314, then with 0 key cards partner would bid 5@S, allowing you to stop below slam. Therefore, here, we address the EKB 0314 in detail and then briefly touch on the other two. In another section you can read why Howard prefers RKC 0314 even if you are not responding to EKB.|

pg| ***** 23 ***** |


ht|x|AT|^B@2Please note that there are only 4 Key Cards or three aces to account for. Here it may look complicated but at a table after the void suit is known responding to EKB becomes very simple as you easily count your aces or the Key Cards, if any, outside the void suit and respond according to one of the the above scheme. Let us look at few examples. Again the trump suit is spades, partner is interested in slam by bidding the EKB, and we are following the 0314 scheme.|

PG| ***** 29 ***** |


ht|m|AT|^B@2It is simple as ABCD. Nothing to memorize. Responder simply counts his Key Cards and bids accordingly. And if partner is void in clubs below is the scheme for responder:|HT|o|

at|^B5@D (1st step) ^e= 0 or 3 Key Cards
5@H (2nd step) ^e= 1 or 4 Key Cards
5@S (3rd step) ^e= 2 Key Cards no trump Queen
5N (4th step) ^e= 2 Key Cards with trump Queen|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


AT|

We need to emphasize an important point here, only for bridge impared players like the Movie Maker. The response steps are fashioned after 0314 RKC. However, the first steps is the next higher bid and the second step is the next higher bid. For example if the EKC is 5@C then the first step would be 5@D. And if the EKC is 5@D then the first step should be 5@H. When the EKC is 4@S then we use 4NT as the first step, 5@C as the second step, 5@D as the third step, and 5@H as the fourth step.|

NT||lb|*bWhat would an optimistic North bid now?^^7h|NT|^B@2
An optimistic South could count 13 tricks - 6 clubs, least 5 hearts on length, 1 diamond, plus 1 spade. So 7@H would be a reasonable bid on this auction. This is a hand where North doesn't count points. He just "pictures" a hand South would need for 6 or 7 to make. Even if South has 5 hearts to the J and nothing else, 6H is a reasonable contract. And, as noted above, it is easy for North to picture that 7@H has good plays once South shows the @HA.|MB|7h|

^-|FP||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|One of my pet peeves is that 1430 was foisted upon the bridge playing public with very little reason. Let me explain the obscure reason why it was invented. 

There is one problem auction with RKCB that 1430 purportedly solves. And that is, 
when the trump suit is hearts, 
and the RKCB response is 5@D. 

In that case there is no way to do a queen ask without committing to at least 6. As you probably remember, you should not bid 6 unless either 
a) you have all 5 Key Cards or 
b) you have 4 Key Cards and the trump Queen.|
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


AT| 

So, let us say hearts are trump, you bid 4N, and partner responds 5@D. And let us say that, based on the 5@D response, you know you have 4 Key Cards, and you do not have the trump Queen. So you are unsure whether or not to bid slam (if partner has the trump Q you want to be in 6 otherwise you do not). Well, you have to guess as to what to do. So that's the problem 1430 is trying to solve. |
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


AT|

Ok, so in order to make 1430 necessary, the following conditions must occur:
^Ca) Hearts are trump.
^Cb) You have determined your side has only 4 Key Cards.
^Cc) You do not have the trump Queen and need to know if partner has it.
^Cd) Partner has responded 5@D.|
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


AT|

^B@2The person who invented 1430 decided that it was more likely, given all these conditions, that you would want to do the Queen ask when partner had 1 or 4 rather than 0 or 3. Therefore they switched the meanings of 5@C and 5@D so that you could do the Queen ask when partner showed 1 or 4 (and not do the Queen ask when partner bid 5@D). Well, it may be true that it is slightly more likely that you want to do the Queen ask with a 1 or 4 rather than 0 or 3. But I doubt that the percentage of time when you need to do the queen ask is that much higher when partner has 1 or 4 than when partner has 0 or 3. |

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|And, the percentage of time that all the other conditions are met is such that we are talking about a situation that comes up very rarely. So they made RKCB much more complicated for a very rare situation. Not to mention, there are hands where, when partner bids 5@D, you want to do a queen ask and can't playing 1430.|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


AT|

Not only that, but most experts have switched back to 0314. The reason is, they now play that 4@S is RKCB when hearts are trump. When you play that, the problem disappears. The responses over 4@S RKCB when partner does not show whether or not he has the Queen are a) 4N (1st step) which shows 0 or 3 and b) 5@C (2nd step) which shows 1 or 4. A 5@D response (3rd step) shows 2 without the Queen and 5@H (4th step) shows 2 with the Queen. So the responses where you need to do a Queen ask are 4N (where  5@C is the Queen ask) and 5@C (where 5@D is the Queen ask), both of which allow you to stop in 5@H when partner denies the Queen. Additionally, lots of non-expert pairs don't even play the Queen ask, so 1430 is of no use to them anyway.|
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


AT|

For the following two reasons I believe 0314 is better.
a) Aesthetically, it is simpler and more logical. When someone first learns simple Blackwood, the responses are 5@C = 0, 5@D = 1, and 5@H = 2. So why not retain that structure when playing RKCB. I think simplicity is very important when you can achieve it. Bridge bidding is complicated enough without throwing in extra complications. For the vast majority of the bridge playing public (including my students) I think they should prefer simplicity whenever possible.|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


AT|

b) Technically, there are some situations where you want to bid slam when partner has 1 key card and stop below slam when partner has 0 Key Cards. But if playing 1430, the response that shows 0 is higher than the response that shows 1. So in some situations RKCB does you no good. The most obvious situation is where clubs are trump. Let's say you decide you would like to play 6@C if partner has 1 key card and only 5@C if partner has 0 Key Cards. Well, if you play 1430, RKCB doesn't help. When partner has 0 Key Cards, he has to bid 5@D, which means you are committed to 6@C regardless. But if you play 0314 then partner bids 5@C with 0, allowing you to stop below slam. Another example. Suppose hearts are trump, you want to bid slam unless partner has 0 Key Cards, and you want to bid 5@D exclusion Blackwood. Unless you play 0314, 5@D does you no good. If you play 1430 partner bids 5@S (2nd step) with 0 which commits you to 6@H. But if you play 0314, partner bids 5@H with 0, so you can stop below slam.|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


AT|

So some teachers recommend you play 1430 most of the time, except for when clubs are trump or when you use Exclusion Blackwood and your bid is one below the trump suit (e.g 5@D is one below 5H). Talk about making it complicated! Just to preserve a convention (1430) which is unnecessary anyway. ^*BJust play 0314 and get rid of all these unnecessary complications.^*N
