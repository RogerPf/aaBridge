Before we begin let us review the Splinter bids. You bid splinter if:
 
- Partner opens 1@H/1@S
- You have 4-card support
- You have a singleton (it could be an honor) or void. 
- You have 13-16 dummy points. Remember, with 17+ dummy points you bid Jacoby 2N even if you have a singleton.
- You can bid splinter if the singleton is an Ace.|

^-|CP||FP||at|^B@2^Z@3When your partner makes a splinter bid, your best holding is ^*Bfour or five cards^*N along with very little (if any) high card strength in partner's short suit. Three low cards is an excellent holding. Contrary to what many players believe, A-x-x is not the perfect holding in partner's short suit. You'd much prefer to have your Ace in partner's longer suit as you will see in the next example.|

In 6S, you are almost certain to lose two heart tricks. However, if you had the @HA instead of the @CA, 6S would be ice-cold. The @HK and @HQ needed help; partner's club holding did not.|

^-|CP||FP||at|^B@2^Z@3The worst holdings opposite partner's splinter bid are strength and shortness. K-Q doubleton in your hand opposite partner's singleton is one loser - just as if you had no honors in the suit at all. Because partner has length in the other suits, you are not likely to get a useful discard from his hand on the other honor once opponents take their Ace.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


AT|

Further, when partner splinters, a doubleton is not the asset you thought it would be. You were hoping that having only two cards in the suit would allow you to ruff partner's loser(s). Partner had such high hopes for his singleton that he upgraded it to 3 dummy points. Unfortunately, neither short suit will generate any extra winners.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |

While your holding in partner's short suit is relevant, don't forget to look at the rest of your hand. On a distributional hand, extra trumps are worth their weight in gold. Although a 9 - card fit and a singleton is nice.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |

There are plenty of unsuccessful slams where a 10th trump would have made all the difference in the world. If opener shows a short suit after a Jacoby 2NT response, it is the equivalent of a splinter bid, so the above guidelines are equally relevant.|

With his six - card suit, 10 HCP and king in opener's major, East was interested in slam after 4@C, so he made a control bid of 4@H. But, because East's 4@H call denied a diamond control, West signed off in game.|

^c@2^y@34@H is the correct answer. First remember that 4@C (spinter bid by opener) means pard has 4 spades, 20+ dummy points, and club shortness. So, slam is quite possible. The only fly in the ointment is that you might have 2 diamond losers. So, you bid 4@H. partner knows that you are interested in slam, but don't have a diamond control. Partner will bid 4@S with no diamond control, otherwise 4N or another control bid with a diamond control. Therefore, your 4@H conveys the exact message you want to send.

HT|t|AT|^c@2^z@3I am sure you noticed that Hands 4-27 and 4-28 (this hand) are indeed the same hand. |CP||AT|The difference is in the auction. In 4-27, the auction goes 1@H-1@S-4@C, which devalues the 1@S bidder's hand quite a bit, due to the club points. In 4-28, the auction goes 1@H-1@S-4@D, which improves the value of the 1@S bidder's hand quite a bit, since he has only small diamonds (the J is not worth much). So, in 4-27, the 1@S bidder should simply close out in game by bidding 4@S. In 4-28, the 1S bidder should look for slam. He can do that by either bidding 4@H (control bid), or jumping right to 4N, since he knows that all suits are controlled (partner has diamonds controlled, and he has hearts and clubs controlled)|

HT|d|fp||cp||at|^B@2^Y@3After partner makes a splinter bid your hand's value either increases or decreases.
1. Subtract all HCP you have in the splinter bid.
2. Re-evaluate your hand based on points you have in splntered suit.
43. Bid accrording to the new value.|
