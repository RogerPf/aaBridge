At times using one of those conventions can throw partnership into an unmakable contract. For example if the agreed trump suit is clubs and 5@D is the response after 4NT call (0314 Blackwood ), partnership probably could be forced to play a doomed 6@C contract.|

^-|CS||CP||fp||ht|m|va|4|CS||CP||fp||at|^B@2
Useful Space Principle (USP) tells bidding theorists that bidding space should be allocated where it is most needed. Mr. Jeff Rubens conceived the Useful Space Principle which in a series of articles published in The Bridge World, from November 1980 through April 1981. Patterning along the USP he also designed Kickback Convention. It is to remedy the problems associated with regular Blackwood and Roman Keycard Conventions. Of course with a price which the proponent claim being negligible and manageable. |

In the Kickback Keycard Asking convention the 4NT bid is replaced by a 4-level bid one bid higher than the trump suit. For an explanation let us use a board from a recent mentoring session by Howard Schutzman. We will focus only on the bidding at the table. |

nt|^y@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me digress for a moment and talk about why 1430 is a problem when clubs are trump. Suppose South had a hand where he wanted to be in slam if North had 1 key card, but stop in 5@C if North had no key cards. |

nt|^y@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Playing 1430, North would bid 5@D with zero key cards and North/South would have to bid 6@C. That is why some pairs, who usually play 1430, will play 0314 if clubs are trump. |

nt|^y@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Personally, I think you should play 0314 regardless of which suit is trump. That just makes things a lot simpler. And there really is no advantage to playing 1430.|

nt|^y@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Kickback RKCB is the way around the queen ask problem. It keeps the bidding low enough to avoid having your side bid a slam when you do not have the necessary key cards and trump strength. Let us go back to 3@C bid by North.|

nt|^y@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The way it works is that the suit above the trump suit is Kickback RKCB suit. So, if playing Kickback, South would bid 4@D over 3@C as RKCB.|mb|4dp|

^B@2As in any ace asking conventions the trump suit must be clearly established and both partners should be on the same page. Then, the suit used to initiate the call for Keycards, as is called Kickback suit, is the suit in rank above the agreed trump suit and the Kickback bid is four of the Kickback suit. When the trump suit is clearly established it is not important whether this suit has been previously bid by anyone on the table or not. Please indulge us with repeating some of information. |

Most expert partnerships use Kickback Keycard Ask for all four suits, Minor suits and Major suits. However, some partnerships use Kickback conventional method only when the trump is a Minor suit (Redwood Convention). |

^-|FP||AT|^B@2
In each example the trump suit is established and partner bids the appropriate Kickback Keycard Ask (KCA). Responder counts his Keycards and responds using a scheme similar to steps used responding to 4NT if partnership was playing either RKC 1430, or RKC 0314--RKC 0314 scheme is more popular. Here, we address the steps used 0314 RKCB and 1430 RKCB.|

^B@2Here the responses may look complicated but at a table responding to Kickback Keycard Ask becomes very simple as you easily count your aces or the Keycards, if any, and respond according to one of the the above scheme. Let us look at few examples. The trump suit is spades, partner is interested in slam by bidding the Kickback Keycard Ask, and we are following the 0314 scheme.|

With Kickback Keycard Ask, instead of a fixed suit-independent 4N ask, the Kickback Keycard Ask is 4 of the next higher suit after the trump suit. When the trump suit is Spades, 4N asks, and the responses are the familiar Keycard responses. When the trump suit is other than Spades, the adjusted Kickback Keycard Ask permits a full range of responses ending at 5 of the trump suit. Therefore, the contract level is never elevated purely because of system requirements. |

^B@2^*BMarilyn Hemenway: ^*N|cp||at| First, there are some disadvantages of using Kickback. One is that the now RKC asking bid is no longer available as a cuebid. Likewise, you can't splinter in that suit. For example, in the next auction:|

ht|i|va|4|cs|6|at|^B{|ia|,1sp3cp4cp!4d|at|}|HT|i|va|4|at|^m@24@D would normally be a cuebid, showing an Ace or Void or a singleton in Diamonds. However, playing Kickback it would be Keycard Ask for clubs. One solution to cuebidding is to play that 4NT is the equivalent of a cuebid in the Kickback suit.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


HT|n|at|^B@2Kickback can cause you problems though. Attempting to use Kickback instead of 4NT as RKC is guaranteed to give you and your partner many headaches and at least 10 bad or below average boards until you BOTH begin to remember it and use it to your advantage. ^*BHowever, don't knock it until you've tried it.^*N|

Partnership agreements like Kickback are fraught with danger. Ask anybody who plays it.....they will have a few stories for you. The following is one of my favorites:|

Now, North realizes that there are two Keycards missing. On the other hand, 5@D would be the response by South had they were playing regular 0314 RKC and North had no choice to correct to 6@C which fails. But, Kickback Keycard Asking save the day (as both partner remembered).|MB|PP|
