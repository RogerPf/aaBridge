cp|8|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Hi Everyone and welcome to today's Seminar in which we're going to take a look at Counting the Hand.

^*bCounting the Hand^*n is the single thing that really shows the difference between average club players and experts.

You cannot hope to progress beyond the level of intermediate unless you really cultivate the habit of counting each and every hand as far as possible.

Bidding is only part of the game, and many of the more advanced cardplay techniques are only really possible if you have a good grasp of what is happening at the table That means being aware of what everyone else has, so far as that is possible.

Similarly, if you already try to count each hand, you will find it difficult to progress significantly further unless you devote more concentration and study to counting every aspect of every hand.

If you watch world-class players, you will often be left thinking "How did they know to take the Club finesse THAT way?" or How did they know to play for the drop in trumps rather than taking the finesse (or vice versa)".

Watching top players is a real education and you really should get to vugraph tables as often as possible.

A few preliminaries There's nothing specifically in the website notes on these topics, but there are five Articles on Counting at   ^*hhttp://bbo.pigpen.org.uk/Articles.php^*n.     These are also available on the IAC site.

If you have a question, please ask it PUBLICLY to the room as a whole.

nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|8|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  OK, let me state at the outset that I cannot really "teach" you to count the hand.

All I can really do is to show you the importance of doing so, and the benefits you derive from the practice.

Counting the hand includes the following: 
^c@2
@.   Counting each defender's points when Declarer

@.   Count partner's and Declarer's points when defending 

@.   Counting the distribution of each suit during the play and

@.   @2^*bMost importantly^*n, working out what inferences you can reasonably take from
the bidding, the play thus far and your count of the hand.
^b@2
Counting the hand is NOT easy.

If it was, everyone would be doing it and we'd all be executing Compound Squeezes and Hedgehogs and Throw-ins a lot more often than we do.

Counting each and every hand accurately and consistently takes a BIG amount of concentration.

Beginners don't have the SPARE concentration to count the hand, because all of the other things like thinking about whether to draw trumps or not, or whether to take the Heart finesse or play for the drop, "What suit did partner lead at trick 2?", or just "how to play this hand" etc etc demand all of their attention.

As you progress on your Bridge journey, you start to do more of these things without conscious thought and so your brain has more time and opportunity to think about more complex things such as whether all the trumps have been drawn, whether this is a hand to draw trumps or play for a cross-ruff, and "Which way should I finesse the Diamond suit".
|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|8|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  At this stage you are generally starting to count SOME aspects of the hand, particularly trumps and key suits.

Still, however, you will find that you are often in a dilemma as to whether to  play for the Spades to split 3-3 or whether to take the finesse on the 3rd round of the suit.

If this is at trick 4 of the hand, you might be having to guess, but if this is at trick 11, an expert will usually have gained a sufficiently good picture of Opps' hands from counting the hand that they rarely get it wrong. 

One other "fault" some people show, is that they concentrate more on the "big" hands, when they're in 6@H, but less on the hands such as part-scores.

In a Pairs competition, you can get every bit as much of a top when you stop Opps from gaining an overtrick in 1NT as you can in making a small slam.

Counting the hand takes disciplined concentration on  ^*bEVERY^*n  hand.

Any questions thus far? 
^^^^
OK, let's find some examples
^^
Alright, now I want you to kibitz South, please
^^^^^^^^^*bMM:^*n   I have rotated some of Oliver's deals so that  YOU  are  ^*balways^*n  in the South seat.

pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
cp|8|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Who has the Queen of Diamonds ?     

If you're guessing or even if you're thinking about playing for a Minor suit Squeeze by playing off both Hearts and throwing a small Club and a Diamond from Dummy, then you've not been counting the hand, because there is absolutely no guesswork involved here.    You can know pretty much FOR CERTAIN who has the  @DQ ?

Anyone ?
|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
at|^*bMM^*n|at|  If you are not CERTAIN who as the @dQ then click on the ^*b Navbar^*n below, to jump back, and again work forward through the play of the tricks.   This time keep a count of the points played by your LHO and RHO.

When you get back here...  decide which of them MUST have the @CA and use that knowledge together with the lack of any opening bid by your opps, to decide that the @DQ must be with...

|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
at|GatorJim:  got it

2pandora:  Well, East did not open the bidding.

|cp|8|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  quite right

GatorJim:  exactly
|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
cp|8|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   If LHO has ducked TWICE holding the A@C, then you can congratulate Garozzo or Meckstroth (whichever it is) after the hand is over, but for practical purposes it is a sure thing that RHO has the A@C.

Absent that, East here (RHO) must have the A@C and has already shown up with the @SAJ and the J@C.

The fact is that LHO MUST have the @DQ.
|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
cp|8|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   You can tell this not by counting the distribution (If you counted, you'll know by this stage that LHO started with 3343 or 3334 and RHO with 4234 or 4243) but simply by counting HCP.

RHO has already shown up with the @SAJ and @CJ and almost certainly still holds the @CA.

If they held the @DQ that would give them a 12-count, yet they passed in 3rd seat, not vulnerable.
|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


sk||
nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
at|^*bMM:^*n|at|   As we all now know where the @DQ is,  I have revealed the hidden cards.

|cp|8|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Now you might usually clock who played Aces, but sometimes the Jacks get "lost" in the shuffle, so easy enough to miss this kind of thing if you're not concentrating Even harder when it comes down to spot cards :)

Watching and making sure you understand Opps' signals and discards, even when they might be lying, is a fairly essential part of counting the hand.
|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


sk||
nt|^z@3^b@2|
at|^^Isabelle10:  Is it better to count opps HCP rather than distribution generally.

|cp|8|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   You must count BOTH.

 A lot of the time, it's a question of taking the right inferences from what they've bid, what they HAVEN'T bid, and so on    ...as well as counting what they actually play.

pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
cp|8|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  What was Declarer's EXACT distribution to start with and what do they have left ?

2pandora:  must be 3325
camilleln:  yes

|cp|8|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  yes  wd
|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
cp|8|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Declarer opened 1NT, and replied 2@D in answer to Stayman, but showed out on the 3rd round of @d's.

That means that they must have 5+ Clubs, and almost certainly exactly 3325 distribution.

Similarly, they MUST have the Q@C in their hand or they'd not have enough for their opening (having only shown up with A@S, KQ@H and K@C thus far).     If they had @CKJxxx, they would surely have run the 10@C initially.
|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
at|2pandora:   it is hard :(

|cp|8|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  is IS hard, you're right

2pandora:   so declarer has left  1 @S,  1 @H and 3 @C's
|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
cp|8|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  but if it was easy, we'd all be Meckstroth and Rodwell, making a living our of making 22-23 HCP 3NT contracts  :)

yes 1 @S, 1 @H and 3 @C's

2pandora:   well i guess u need to keep clubs so throw @S
|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
cp|8|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Ok, @2this not a terribly good example in that you're okay as long as you keep at least 2 Clubs because partner MUST have the @cJ because   if Declarer has the @cKQJ

^c(1) ^d they'd have attacked Clubs a lot earlier and

^c(2) ^d they'd have a 15-count and would have bid 3NT
|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
at|GatorJim:  that means that your additional spade is only good if you get in, and the only way that can happen
^qin clubs with the 8 or 9 at the last trick.
^b@2|cp|8|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  quite, so chuck the @S.      Declarer cannot have 4.    

The thing is, how many times you you see people throw away the ONE card they needed to keep at all costs because they'd not counted the hand.    I see it on about 5 hands a day, every day, at least.

gypsy1308:  I think West has another @C

|cp|8|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Well that's the issue

arnabmoitr:  East should have 9 clubs
|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|case_no_6:  West is almost surely single club.  They led the 2.

cp|8|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   They won't have 2, for sure, so it's a singleton or 3.

case_no_6:  that puts 9 clubs with East to go with their void in Hearts.

|cp|8|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Yes, 9 Clubs with East is fairly consistent with a 5@C opening, is it not?

case_no_6:  means spades and diamonds total 4 cards  - which means that N must have 9 cards in  @s's and @d's
|

More for a look at the table than anything else, you lead off with the A@D and |

cp|8|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Gold stars to the last three comments.  If you lead ANYTHING other than the @SK, you've just given the hand away.  Clearly Declarer has a strong hand so partner will not have much here.

There's room for them to have the @SQ, however, and the absolute priority must be to try to kill Dummy in the hope that Declarer only has 2 Spades or 3 Spades without the Queen.

cp|8|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  If Declarer has ANY 2-card Spade holding, or any 3-card holding that doesn't include the Queen, the @SK lead kills dummy stone dead.
  
If Declarer started with @SQxx, just comfort yourself that you were never beating this contract anyway.

With @SQxx, Declarer can duck the first round of @S win the second one in hand and lead a Diamond but with Jx or Jxx, they have no defence.
