Susan is a full-time bridge professional specializing in online instruction for beginner and intermediate level players. She is an ACBL accredited instructor and certified Club Director, as well as a regular lecturer in the BIL. A Dartmouth College alumna, her bridge accomplishments include a Silver Medal from the 2002 World Bridge Championships in Montreal (Junior Pairs). 
|HT|k|va|5|at|^b@2^r@3Susan writes: "In my teaching I'm very mindful of the realities of online bridge, where it's common to sit down and play with a complete stranger. The three areas that contribute the most to overall results in any partnership are:

^C* sound bidding fundamentals,
^C* good judgment, and
^C* being able to take your tricks!

|HT|q|va|5|at|^b@2^y@3"Like many bridge players, I got my start in college. An unimaginative search for 'bridge' in the Dartmouth directory led me to the student bridge club, and that, as they say, was that. I was fortunate enough to be taken under the wings of two upperclassmen, and under their tutelage quickly made an entry into tournament bridge. After two years I assumed management of the club, expanding membership through on-campus lessons, special games, and supervised play sessions. While I still enjoy traveling to tournaments around the United States and abroad, I have focused on developing teaching materials and techniques specifically designed for the online medium." |

%%%%%%%%%%Introduction
qx|A1, Introduction|HT|d|fp|4|cp|8|at|^-
{    Based on two lessons in November 2007 by Susan Doty    }
^-|HT|F|FP||cp||AT|
^B@2In 2007, when I decided to learn playing bridge, I began attending Susan Doty's weekly lessons with passion. The material presented here is from lessons on November 3 and November 17, 2007 on Negative Doubles. 

In making this presentation and to make it interactive I changed her format a bit. Otherwise the teaching is all Susan Doty--pure gold. Further, I have used other material from the public domain to re-enforce Susan's teaching. Please note, as is the rule in bridge, not all experts agree on all aspects of the Negative Doubles. At the end of this presentation I have listed good sources for additional reading.

With the new format the viewer gets to opportunity to bid the hand and in most instances to play the deals double dummy. Further, I have included learning material on the topic from various sources. Articles published in Bridge Bulletin by David Landloper, ^*Negative Doubles^*N book by Marty Bergen, Fifth Chair at|CP|1|AT| ^*Hwww.fifthchair.org/archive.html^*N|CP||AT|, and chat logs from several other teachers in Beginner-Intermediate Lounge (BIL) are to name a few. 

A comprehensive help section is available for those viewer who are new to the BBO presentations. One final note. This presentation was originally made for my learning and may contain many elementary sections which may bore many intermediate players for which I ask their forgiveness. All material not from Susan Doty's lesson are in italic print. 

Before starting the lesson on Negative Doubles I would like to present a summary of constructive and competitive bidding after partner opens one of a suits. It is just a reminder and prepares you for the Negative Doubles. In all examples you, the viewer, is sitting South and the Partner is North.

Were the Radio Lessons in vogue in 2007 I never could have saved this excellent material. Thus, I am presenting it to you, and will keep doing other saved materials, to underline the greatness of text based lessons. I know it is another Don Quixote saga! and the crowd is on march.|

Your bid is 2H. The opponent on right side passed. You have a minimum responding hand with support for your partner suit. Partner will decide where to place the contract. With a minimum opening hand Partner simply passes and the contract would be 2H. Ah! I wish bridge was that simple all the time. |mb|2h|

This is a simple. You have a maximum responder hand with 4-card support and you wish to make your partnership at least gets to game. Therefore, assuming you play Jacoby 2N you bid it.|MB|2N|

NT|^B@2^Z@3
In the three previous examples you were in a constructive bidding--the opponents did not interfere. Let us find out what would be the options if your Right Hand Opponent (RHO) injects a natural overcall. We will start with the example 1.|

You probably have answered it correctly. But for those of us who need help let us evaluate the situation. We as responder still have a minimum responding hand - 6/9 - with 3+-card support. The spades suit is negligible. Nothing really has changed from example 1. Therefore, you ignore the overcall and bid as you did with first example. |MB|2h|

I am sure you did not bid 3H as that bid shows a weak hand with support for Partner's suit. After a natural overcall by your RHO you cuebid (100% forcing) that suit when you have and invitational hand or more with 3-card support for Partner. Bid 2S.|MB|2s|

Let us look at your options. You cannot pass - partnership probably has 1/2 of the points in the deck. With only 2-card heart support you cannot bid 2H. With no stoppers in spades bidding 1NT is suicidal. So as I am sure you already figured it out you should double.|

I am sure you love to double for penalty. However, after learning the Negative Doubles that is the last think you should do. How can I enjoy the benefit of this beautiful hand you may ask. Simple. Pass and let your partner do the work for you. He is most likely is short in diamonds and would double. That is when you pass and convert it to a penalty double. On the other hand, 2N bid has some merits too - copyright violation noted.|MB|P|

HT|f|fp||cp|8|at|^B@2Susan Doty|CP||AT|: With so many different types of doubles floating around, one of the most important things for us to do is be clear on when which one applies. Negative Doubles are one of our most frequent and valuable types, and luckily for us we can very clearly define when basic Negative Doubles apply.
^C@21. Our partner must open the bidding 1-of-a-suit.
2. The next opponent must make a natural suit overcall. (It can be a jump, but it must be natural.)
3. If we (responder) then double, it is a Negative Double.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


va|6|AT|
^-{    The overcall can be a jump, but it must be natural and below the level agreed to by the partnership.
3@S or 4@D are commonly used cut-off points.    }
^-|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


at|^B@2
So the good news is that we shouldn't have much trouble identifying when we're in a basic Negative Double situation, since we can define them so simply. The other half of the equation - figuring out what the Negative Double is supposed to show - is slightly more complicated since it depends on the specific auction. That's what we're going to be focusing our attention on today.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


AT|
 
When partner's opening bid is overcalled, that overcall takes away some of our side's bidding room. In particular it takes away some of responder's options at his first turn. Negative Doubles were introduced really as a tool to help responder have a way to show his hand with a particular emphasis on getting the unbid major suit into the picture. The best way to get a feel for Negative Doubles is to look at examples, which is what we're going to start doing in a moment. However, there are a few general guidelines that we have to help us out with these auctions.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


AT|

1. If there is only ONE unbid major, - that is the only suit promised by responder's Negative Double.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


AT|

2. If there are TWO (or zero) unbid majors, responder's Negative Double only promises ONE of the unbid suits. (Could he have length in both? Sure. But he only guarantees one.) Responder's double also shows that he has enough points to get involved in the bidding.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||
%%%Page
HT|E|AT|^B@2At the 1-level, 6+ HCPs - the same as for a 1-level response in an uncontested auction. The higher the level of the overcall, the more points responder needs to stick his nose in. Today we'll be working on auctions where there is only ONE unbid major suit, so let's jump in.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


%%%%%
cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|Most experts recommend 6+ HCPs to make a negative Double after an overcall at one level, 8+ after an over call of a minor suit at two level, 9+ after an over call of a major suit at two level, and 10+ for over calls at higher levels.

Further, as in any hand evaluation, along with HCPs the doubler should additionally consider whether he has prime cards, very good distribution, shortness in the over called suit, and points in opener's suit. The doubler should upgrade or down grade based on those conditions.

With that said let us begin the first example. In all examples I have changed the format from the original way presented by Susan to be more instructive. Those changes are cosmetic.^*N

After a 1@H overcall from the opponents, responder has two ways to introduce the spade suit:|

PG| ***** 41 ***** |

- but he also has a Negative Double available. (Since spades is the only unbid major, spades is the suit a Negative Double would promise.)

Since we're at the 1-level, he could make either bid with 6+ points.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
In this situation, the difference between the two is responder's spade LENGTH
1@D (1@H) 1@S = 5+ spades and 6+ points
1@D (1@H) Double = Exactly 4 spades and 6+ points.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
There are two possible reasons for responder to show his major via a Negative Double rather than bidding it directly. Either 
a) he doesn't have enough LENGTH to bid the suit directly, and/or |
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


AT|
b) he doesn't have enough STRENGTH to bid the suit directly.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
As I mentioned a moment ago, Strength isn't an issue in this particular auction (responder doesn't need any extra strength to bid 1@S), so the relevant feature is responder's spade Length. You might be wondering why we would want to distinguish between a 4 card spade holding and a 5+ card spade holding.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


sk||NT|^B@2^Z@3
The answer is that it makes opener's life a little easier. Since opener knows that responder only has four spades here (since he made a  Negative  Double instead of bidding 1@S), he knows that they don't have a 5-3 spade fit, therefore, he has an easy time rebidding his diamonds.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
If the partnership weren't playing negative doubles, and responder just made a bid that showed 4+ spades, opener wouldn't be sure whether or not they had a spade fit and there are some hands he could have with 3 card spade support where he would have a hard time deciding what to do.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
Keep in mind that this is a competitive auction, and East will sometimes bid as well. The higher the bidding gets, the more valuable it is for opener to know what to do when he  has 3 cards in responder's major.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
As far as the Strength responder needs for a Negative Double goes, the lower limit depends on the specific auction.  If we're still at the 1-level, 6 points is enough. The higher the overcall, the more points responder needs to bid (but that's not a new idea :)). |
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
While there is a minimum number of points required to make a Negative Double,|CP|8|at|

^-{ ** making a Negative Double does not put an upper limit on responder's strength.**}

at|
All responder's Double in this auction said was "Partner, I have exactly 4 spades and at least 6 points." Responder's second bid goes a long way towards clarifying how strong he is.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
In this example, responder was always going to insist on playing in game. The only question in his mind was "which one? If the partnership has a 4-4 spade fit, they should probably play in spades (the opponents could have a lot of hearts between them, and one stopper isn't always enough for 3NT).|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
If they don't have a spade fit, then 3NT rates to be the best contract. The Negative Double was responder's first step towards finding out, as he'd learn whether opener had 4 card @S support or not.|

Responder's hand is pretty different than the last one, but it shares one key characteristic: he has exactly four spades. So, he brings his spade suit into the picture via a Negative Double - "Partner I have exactly 4 spades and 6+ points." Opener's rebid after partner's negative double is completely natural. There's nothing fancy we have to remember. Opener takes the information from partner's bid into account, and tries to pick the rebid that best describes his hand.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3 
1NT isn't perfect with a singleton in partner's major, but it's a better overall description than rebidding a 5 card club suit would be. If responder had more points (11+) he would bid again over 1NT (either to invite game or insist on it), but since he has a Weak responding hand he is content to leave it in 1NT.|

Several of you have asked about what responder promises in the other unbid suit. When there is only one unbid major suit, that major is the ONLY suit responder's Negative Double promises. I guess what I'm trying to say is that Negative Doubles are NOT the same as Takeout Doubles.  Responder's Double here is defined as "4@S, 6+ points." Note that there's nothing in that definition about the club suit.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
Could responder have clubs? Absolutely (he had more clubs in Hand ##1, which is very similar to this one). But does he promise clubs? No, not at all.|

If responder goes ahead and bids 1@S directly, rather than introducing the suit via a Negative Double, then he promises at least 5 of them. This information can really help opener, since if he has 3 card support he knows that it's safe to raise. (that's especially true if East had bid something (like supporting Partner's @H suit).|
PG| ***** 91 ***** |

NT|^B@2^Z@3
This is a slightly different auction - partner was the one who bid hearts, and the opponent made a 2@C overcall. However, there is still only one unbid major suit - spades - so that is the suit responder's Negative Double promises. Responder needs to be a little stronger to bid in this example, since the overcall is at the 2-level. He needs about 8+ points to double here (opener is forced to bid at the 2-level, but still has room to rebid 2 of his own suit).|
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
Responder does have diamond length in this example, but his double says nothing about diamonds. He has some, but he doesn't have to. When opener rebids 2@H, responder knows that 
^Ca) partner doesn't have 4 card spade support, and 
^Cb) partner most likely doesn't have 4 diamonds either (since he didn't rebid 2@D).

^BWith only a singleton in opener's heart suit, 3NT seems like the best place to play.|

NT|^B@2^Z@3
After the auction starts 1@C (1@S), the unbid major suit is hearts, so, responder's Negative Double shows hearts. An idea I mentioned earlier but which I want to emphasize is this one. There are two possible reasons why responder might introduce his major via a Negative Double rather than bidding it directly. Either 
^ca) he doesn't have enough LENGTH to bid the suit directly, AND/OR 
^Cb) he doesn't have enough STRENGTH.|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
In this example responder has neither the @H length nor strength to bid 2@H, so he makes a  Negative  Double to bring the suit into the picture. Since the bidding is still at the 1-level, his bid shows @Hs and 6+ points (no upper limit). Opener should assume that responder has exactly four hearts when he doubles. so, when opener raises, he promises 4 card support.|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
[Note: if opener were stronger, he could make a jump raise of hearts just like he could if the bidding had started 1@C (pass) 1@H].|

This time responder's STRENGTH isn't an issue. He certainly has enough points to go ahead and bid at the 2-level. However, his heart LENGTH is a problem - he only has 4 of them, so he can't bid 2@H here. So, he shows that he has hearts by making a Negative Double. When opener shows a 4-4 heart fit, opener can bid the heart game.|

NT|^B@2^Z@3
After the 1@S overcall, if responder wants to bid his hearts directly he has to do so at the 2-level. His direct 2@H bid shows:
1) 5+ card heart suit (with only 4 he would make a  Negative  Double instead), AND
2) 11+ total points (invitational or stronger).|
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
2@H IS A FORCING BID - opener MAY NOT PASS. This is very important to understand (and remember) because I see this bid misused all the time. You can compare this auction to SAYC auctions like
1@H (pass) 2@C
 or
1@S (pass) 2@H|
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
Responder needs to have at least 11 points, and opener isn't allowed to pass. Since responder guarantees a 5+ card heart suit for his 2@H bid here, opener can confidently raise with 3 card support. Keep this example in mind as we look at the next hand.|

NT|^B@2^Z@3 
If this hand were played in a big BBO tournament, I would (regrettably) expect to see a lot of 2@H bids from North. Unfortunately, as much as responder would love to tell partner about his hearts, one bid North can NOT make is 2@H. |
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
We just saw in the last hand that 2@H would be a FORCING bid, showing 5+ hearts and 11+ points. Responder certainly has the necessary heart LENGTH for that bid, but he does not have the needed STRENGTH. |
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
Okay, so responder cannot bid 2@H. Is there anything he  - can -  do? Yes. Negative Doubles come to the rescue. Remember how I said earlier that there are two possible reasons why responder might show his suit via a Negative Double instead of bidding it directly - either not enough LENGTH or not enough STRENGTH?|
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
Well, in this example STRENGTH is the problem. A few of you have asked about the possibility of bidding 3@H. To me, 3@H is like jumping off a cliff. We only have 6 hearts, @Sxxx is an awful holding, our @DQJx is defensive, and our singleton is in partner's opened suit. 3@H could turn out very badly, and the opponent's just haven't put that much pressure on us yet. |
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
There's no reason to commit our side all the way to 3@H when we shouldn't expect to make it. Seeing as it's perfectly likely that we'd be able to stop the auction at a lower level if we took things a bit more slowly.|
PG| ***** 171 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
Anyhow if responder wants to tell partner about his heart suit (which I certainly would) his first step is to make a Negative Double. Does this tell partner that he has 6 hearts? No, it just tells him that we have 4 but it's a first step, and that's better than nothing. At least partner now knows that we have a heart suit depending on how the auction unfolds, we might get to show our extra heart length at our second bid (like here).|
PG| ***** 172 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
This is an important auction to understand, so we're going to walk through the reasoning from opener's point of view. What in the world is responder showing with this auction? |
PG| ***** 173 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
Well his first bid was a Negative Double. Okay, so that tells us that he has a heart suit. But then we (opener) rebid 1NT. So we told him that we don't have 4 hearts with him. But then Partner went ahead and bid hearts again anyway! If he only had 4 hearts that wouldn't make any sense. He knows we don't have a 4-4 heart fit.|
PG| ***** 174 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
So he must have more than 4 hearts in his hand. But wait a second if he has 5+ hearts, why didn't he bid 2@H the first time around, instead of making a Negative Double?|
PG| ***** 175 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
Oooh... he must not have had enough POINTS to bid 2@H directly. Therefore, responder's bidding in this sequence shows a hand with extra heart length (it's usually 6), but with limited points  only about 5-10.|
PG| ***** 176 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3  
Unlike a direct 2@H bid (which would have shown 11+ points and have been forcing), responder's bidding here is NOT inviting us to bid again he's showing long hearts but limited strength, so this bid is non-forcing.|

%%%%%%%%%% recap
bt||qx|A4, Recap|HT|E|cp|8|at|^B@2Susan Doty|CP||AT|: To quickly recap the key concepts behind these Negative Double auctions.
1) Basic Negative Doubles (luckily for us) only apply in very specific circumstances:
- partner opens the bidding 1-of-a-suit
- the next opponent makes a natural suit overcall below a certain level - 3@S or 4@D are probably the most common, but check with your partner.(It can be a jump overcall, but it has to be a natural suit bid and not notrump or Michaels or anything like that.)
 - if responder then doubles, it is a Negative Double.|
PG| ***** 178 ***** |


AT|

2) Responder's Negative Double only guarantees ONE of the two unbid suits -- always a major suit if there is one.
Negative Doubles are NOT the same as Takeout Doubles! Might responder have length in both unbid suits? Absolutely, he often will. Does his  Negative  Double  - promise -  length in both unbid suits? No. :-)
[There is only infrequent exception to that: 1@C (1@D) Double does show both @H+@S, since responder could bid either 1@H or 1@S with only a 4 card suit. However, that is the ONLY exception.]|
PG| ***** 179 ***** |


AT|
  
3) The strength needed to make a Negative Double depends on the level of the auction. If opener will be able to bid again at the 1-level, 6+ points is enough. If opener will have to bid at the 2-level, but still has room to return to 2 of his own suit, then responder needs about 8+ points.If opener will have to rebid above 2 of his own suit, responder needs to be stronger (makes sense, right?).|
PG| ***** 180 ***** |


NT||
%%%%%%%% page 2
HT|E|cp|8|at|^B@2Susan Doty|CP||AT|: For example, if the auction goes 1@D (2@H), for responder to double he should have about an invitational strength hand (or better) since if opener doesn't have spades, he's going to have to rebid 2NT or 3 of something and responder has to be strong enough for that to be a safe level for the partnership to play at.|
PG| ***** 181 ***** |


AT|
 
You get the idea - the higher that we'll be making partner bid, the stronger we have to be (since we can't count on him to have any more than a minimum opening hand and we cannot assume that he has a fit for our suit either).|
PG| ***** 182 ***** |


AT|
  
And last but not least.
4) There are two possible reasons why responder might show his major via a  Negative Double rather than by bidding the suit directly either
^Ca) not enough LENGTH, or 
^Cb) not enough STRENGTH that should say "and/or"|

^-|
HT|f|fp||cp|8|at|^B@2Susan Doty|CP||AT|: Today I'm going to be continuing on the topic of Negative Doubles. Now that we have criteria for identifying whether a double by responder is a Negative Double, the next thing to tackle is "what does a Negative Double show?" Very generally, Negative Doubles give responder an additional way to show an unbid suit, and the emphasis is always an unbid major if there is one.|
PG| ***** 186 ***** |


AT|

As we already know, there are two possible reasons for responder to use a Negative Double to show his suit, instead of simply bidding it directly. Either:
    ^Ca) he doesn't have enough LENGTH to bid the suit directly, and/or 
    ^Cb) he doesn't have enough STRENGTH to bid the suit directly.|
PG| ***** 187 ***** |


AT|

^BFurther, it's important to understand that Negative Doubles and Takeout Doubles are NOT the same thing. Takeout Doubles guarantee support for  - all -  of the unbid suits - that isn't the case with Negative Doubles. With a single exception|CP|8|AT|*|CP||AT|, responder's Negative Double only promises ONE of the two unbid suits and it will always be an unbid major if there is one in the auction.|
PG| ***** 188 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

* |CP||AT|That exception (as we learned last week) is the auction 1@C-(1@D)-Dbl, which most pairs use to show both @H+@S. |

HT|t|va|4|at|^B{|ia|1c1dx|at|}|at|^mand|ht|t|at|^n{|ia|1c1dx|AT|}|HT|w|AT|^B@2
the double promises 4-4 in both majors - Negative Doubles here always show support for the unbid major(s).^*N|
PG| ***** 190 ***** |


at|^B

When responder makes a Negative Double he certainly *can* have both unbid suits, but he only guarantees ONE of them. That's one of the most important features of Negative Doubles to understand. Let us look at a few hands. A few of them are just to recap what we learned from last week.^*N|

NT|^B@2^Z@3
When the auction starts 1@D (1@H), there is only one unbid major -- @S -- so that is the suit responder's double shows. Of the two reasons I mentioned for responder to show a suit via a Neg Dbl instead of simply bidding it (not enough length and/or not enough strength), only "length" is an issue here. Since responder could still bid spades at the one level, he wouldn't need any extra strength for that the usual 6+ points would be enough.|
PG| ***** 203 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
So in this situation, we use a Neg Dbl vs a 1@S bid to distinguish between responder's spade LENGTH
    1@D (1@H) Dbl = Exactly 4 spades, 6+ points
    1@D (1@H) 1@S = 5+@S, 6+ points.|
PG| ***** 204 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3 
Knowing that responder has only 4 spades helps opener judge what to do when he holds 3 card support. Since partner doubled instead of bidding 1@S, opener (holding 3 of them) knows that they don't have an 8 card spade fit. That can be a very useful piece of information, especially if East doesn't pass for example, if he had been able to raise to 2@H.|

NT|^B@2^Z@3
A few things to note on this hand. First, responder's double does not limit his strength: in this situation he just shows exactly 4 spades and 6+ points. He could have any strength range when he doubles. It's his later bidding that will tell opener more about his points. Just like when the auction starts 1@D (pass) 1@S opener doesn't know how strong responder is, only that he has at least 6 points.|
PG| ***** 217 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
Second, and perhaps more importantly, you will note that responder DOES NOT HAVE CLUB LENGTH  and that's okay, because his double doesn't say anything at all about clubs: the only unbid major suit after 1@D (1@H) is spades, so that is the suit the double deals with. Could responder have club length? Absolutely. But does he promise clubs? Not at all.|
PG| ***** 218 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
We won't spend too much time today talking specifically about opener's second bid after partner's Negative Double, but that's only because there isn't anything fancy to it. Opener's second bid is natural - it should reflect whether or not he has support, his distribution, and his strength just like his rebid in an uncontested auction would.|

North knows that his side should reach game, but he doesn't immediately know which one: 4@S is probably best if opener also has four spades, but otherwise 3NT is likely the best contract. Responder's first move is to make a Negative Double, showing his four card spade suit. He'll have a better idea of what to do after he hears opener's second bid. In this case, opener showed that he also has 4@S, so responder can place the contract.|

This auction has a different start, but one key similarity to the previous examples. There is only one unbid Major suit - spades - so that is the suit a negative double would promises. Responder is strong enough for just about any bid (he's going to insist on reaching game), but with only 4 spades he doesn't have the spade LENGTH to bid 2@S. So, his first move is to make a Negative Double. |

At this point opener has a problem. What in the world is he supposed to bid? He obviously can't support spades, and this isn't a time to bid notrump without a @C stopper. He is short a diamond for a 2@D bid. With a strong 5 card heart suit, rebidding hearts is going to be the lesser of the evils. Is 2@H a perfect bid? No. We'd really rather have 6 hearts. But as you can see, sometimes we don't have a 100% accurate bid available to us, and we have to make due the best we can.|

Again we have an auction with only one unbid major - hearts - , so that's the suit a negative double by responder would promise. Responder has enough STRENGTH to bid 2@H (it would be forcing for 1 round, so responder would need 11+ points), but he lacks enough LENGTH for a direct 2@H bid.  |
PG| ***** 280 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
So, he brings hearts into the picture by making a Negative Double. If opener has four hearts also, he'll raise hearts and the fit will be found. If opener doesn't raise hearts, responder knows they don't have a 4-4 fit. Yes, he does but he only has 4 hearts.|

North has a bunch of nice looking hearts, and I know it's tempting to bid 2@H, but that's the one bid that responder SHOULD NOT MAKE. As we saw in the previous example, a 2@H bid shows 5+ hearts and 11+ points it's a forcing bid as much as responder loves his heart suit, his hand just isn't strong enough to force his side to 2NT or higher. If responder can't bid 2@H, what can he do? Well, he has two options.|
PG| ***** 306 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
He could pass and wait to see what happens. The bidding might stop low enough for him to bid 2@H at his - second turn - ; or he can use a Negative Double to at least get hearts into the picture.  When responder doubles, opener is going to initially assume that he just has four hearts. Obviously North has more than four, but it's a start. This auction may seem counterintuitive at first, so we're going to walk through it. |
PG| ***** 307 ***** |


mb|d|an|Neg Dbl (H)|mb|1N|sk|s|lb|*bChoose your bid.^^p|NT|^B@2^Z@3
Let's consider this bidding from opener's point of view. Responder's first bid was a Negative Double. If we (as opener) had four hearts, we would have known we had a heart fit and would have competed in hearts instead of just passing 1NT. When we passed 1NT, we basically told partner that we didn't have four card heart support. But then partner went and bid 2@H anyway. What's up with that? It wouldn't make sense to try to play in hearts if he only had 4 of them, since we'd already told him there was no 4-4 fit.|
PG| ***** 309 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
So the 2@H bid must mean that he has more than four hearts. But if responder has more than four hearts, why didn't he bid 2@H at his first turn, right after the 1@S overcall? The only possible reason would be that he didn't have enough ^*BSTRENGTH^*N for a direct 2@H bid (because we now know that that would be forcing and promise 11+ points.)|
PG| ***** 310 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
So in this bidding, responder has shown a hand with extra heart length. (At least 5 but usually 6) but with limited strength only about 6-10 points (not strong enough to have bid 2@H immediately over 1@S.)|

I feel like I should give a practical bit of advice here, since I know that many of you don't have the luxury of always playing in an established partnership.|
PG| ***** 314 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
If you think that your partner wouldn't understand this bidding, that's okay to pass 1@S instead of making a Negative Double. You might get to bid 2@H later, and hopefully your partner would understand (from the fact that you passed initially) that you don't have many points.|
PG| ***** 315 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
The one bid that you DO NOT want to make is 1@D (1@S) 2@H. No matter how nice your hearts are, you just aren't strong enough to make a forcing bid. Partner won't be too happy if he ends up playing 3NT expecting 11+ points in the dummy, and you only turn up with 6.|
PG| ***** 316 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
We can't immediately tell how strong partner is for his double it's his later bidding that clarifies his strength for us.|

This is a more advanced auction, but I know there are some upper intermediates in the audience. Responder has a game going hand, but he needs to learn more about partner's hand before he can tell which game they should play. His first move is to make a Negative Double. |
PG| ***** 325 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
His double here promises at least 4 hearts (usually exactly 4) and 6+ points. He doesn't promise more strength than that since opener still has room to bid 1NT or 2 of his own suit.|
pg| ***** 326 ***** |


mb|p|sk|s|lb|*bChoose your bid.^^2c|NT|^B@2^Z@3
Opener has another uncomfortable decision here. He only has 3 hearts so he doesn't want to raise hearts. (He expects partner to have exactly 4). He also only has a small doubleton spade, which isn't great for notrump considering that's the suit the opponent bid. Nothing is perfect, so he should choose between 1NT (problem = no spade stopper) or 2@C (problem = only a 5 card club suit). We'll go with a 2@C bid for now, recognizing that it isn't perfect.|

So what's next for responder? He doesn't have a spade stopper, so going straight to 3NT would be ill-advised. Basically, he still can't tell which game contract is best. 2@D is an option, or he can even cuebid 2@S. Responder's 2@S bid can't be natural. N/S wouldn't want to play in spades after West overcalled the suit. So this has to be something else.|mb|2S|
PG| ***** 331 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
If North had a spade stopper in his own hand, he could simply bid notrump himself, right? So 2@S isn't valuable as a "spade stopper -showing-" bid. Bidding notrump would do that quite nicely.  |
PG| ***** 332 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
Instead, this 2@S bid is more of an ASKING bid. It's obviously forcing (opener can't pass), so it says "partner, I have a good hand. I'm strong enough to force you to bid again. But I can't tell where we should play." |
pg| ***** 333 ***** |


NT||mb|p|sk|s|lb|*bChoose your bid.^^3h|mb|3H|NT|^B@2^Z@3
Opener is going to make another descriptive bid, and one of his priorities would be to bid notrump if he could. He can't bid notrump here with only @S 105, so he's going to decide on another bid that he thinks says something about his hand.  He can't bid notrump. 3@D is also not a great idea with only a three card diamond suit.  Opener probably isn't too happy about being forced to find another bid, but he can bid 3@H.|
PG| ***** 335 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
Remember that this 3@H bid is in context of the entire auction: opener bid 2@C earlier. If he had FOUR card heart support, he would have raised hearts at his second turn instead of rebidding his club suit. So it's okay for him to bid 3@H here with his 3 card support, since his earlier bidding denied 4 of them. |
PG| ***** 336 ***** |

NT|^B@2^Z@3
While we really emphasize 8 card major suit fits, it's not that uncommon to play in a 7 card fit if you don't have a stopper for notrump. And that's where N/S are likely to end up here. The other option would be 5@C, but 4@H only requires 10 tricks.|

%%%%%%%% Page
HT|e|fp||cp|8|at|^B@2Susan Doty|CP||AT|: So far we've looked at several examples of Negative Doubles. In all of the hands so far, there was ONE unbid major suit, and so that was the suit that responder's double promised. Could responder have length in the other unbid suit? Yes. Did his double say anything about his length in that other unbid suit? No. |
PG| ***** 342 ***** |


AT|

Negative Doubles only promise length in ONE of the two unbid suits, and it's always the unbid major if there is one. As far as the strength requirements go, how strong responder needs to be for his negative double depends on the specific auction. One of the best ways to think about it is "how high will I be forcing partner to bid?"  |
PG| ***** 343 ***** |


AT|

In an auction like 1@C (1@S) Dbl, opener still has room to bid at the 1-level. So responder only needs 6 points to double. If the bidding goes 1@H (2@D) Dbl, opener is going to have to bid at the 2-level. But he still has room to rebid 2@H if he's stuck, so about 8+ points would be enough for responder to double. |
PG| ***** 344 ***** |


AT|

For something like "1@D (2@H) Dbl", responder should have a good 10 or more points. Just think about what's going to happen if opener doesn't have spade support. He doesn't have room to rebid 2@D. So he'll either have to bid 2NT, or a minor at the 3-level (yikes).|
PG| ***** 345 ***** |


AT|

Since opener doesn't have to have any more than 12 or 13 points, responder should have a good 10+ points to potentially force the bidding to 2NT or higher.|
PG| ***** 346 ***** |


AT|

There isn't a special formula or anything you need to memorize, to tell how strong you need to be to make a Negative Double. You just want to think about what bids are available to partner if he doesn't have a fit for your major and make sure that you're strong enough to justify forcing the bidding up that high.|
PG| ***** 347 ***** |


AT|

Earlier we were working on auctions where there was only one unbid major suit, so we knew exactly which suit responder's negative double promised. Those are usually the easiest negative double auctions, since at least we were 100% clear on what suit we were dealing with. However, in some auctions there are two (or zero) unbid major suits.Our general rule still applies: a negative double by responder only guarantees ONE of the two unbid suits, always a major if there is one. That doesn't change if there are two (or zero) unbid majors in an auction.|

If responder had to have both hearts and spades to make a negative double in this auction, he would be up the creek. He wouldn't be able to double, and a 2@H bid should show at least a 5 card heart suit (so that opener knows it's ok to raise with 3 card support.) Luckily for us, responder does NOT need to have both hearts and spades to make a negative double. The double only promises ONE of the two unbid suits.|

NT|^B@2^Z@3 
Could responder have both majors? Absolutely. That would be ideal since he would be all set if opener was able to bid either major suit. But he doesn't guarantee both. That's a key point. Negative Doubles are supposed to be a tool to help responder handle interference from the opponents giving him a way to show a major suit that he might not be able to otherwise. |
PG| ***** 356 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
If we were to restrict Negative Doubles and say that responder must have both unbid suits, we leave him with almost as big of a problem as when there weren't any negative doubles at all. |
PG| ***** 357 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
What would we expect responder to do with this hand if he wasn't allowed to double? Anyhow negative doubles only guarantee ONE of the two unbid suits.|

CP|8|AT|*

*|CP||AT|The only exception is the auction I mentioned earlier -- 1@C (1@D) Dbl. Since responder has room to bid either hearts or spades at the 1-level, he can do so with only a 4 card suit. Therefore his double promises both.)|

Now, just because responder only needs one of the unbid suits to double, doesn't mean that he doesn't have to think about what's going to happen next. If responder doubles with only one of the unbid majors, he has to be prepared to hear partner bid the one he doesn't have. In this example, he has a club stopper --- so if opener doesn't show a heart fit, responder can put it in notrump.|mb|3N|

Here we have a similar example. Responder doubled to find out whether they had a heart fit, but when opener didn't bid hearts responder followed up with a natural (and invitational) 2NT bid. Responder was prepared in case opener didn't have a fit for his heart suit.|

In this example, responder's "back-up plan" was his club support. He couldn't bid 2@H over 2@D because that would have been a forcing bid, and he wasn't nearly strong enough. He could have passed over 2@D, but making a Negative Double gave him a way to tell partner that he had some points, and compete without getting the partnership overboard.|
PG| ***** 389 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3
Is this a perfect solution for responder? No. 3@C might not be a great contract. But that's one of the reasons opponents overcall to make our lives harder by taking away bidding room.  We usually can't bid as precisely in competitive auctions as in uncontested auctions, simply because we have less room to work with.|

Even though a negative double would only promise one of the two unbid suits, that doesn't mean that it's okay to make one every time we have one of the suits. Responder needs to think about how the rest of the auction is going to go. What's going to happen if opener bids the suit responder doesn't have?|

Hmm, this isn't so good for North/South. It's not a disaster, since at least they have a 4-3 spade fit. But it's also not great. Responder wasn't really prepared for a 2@S rebid from opener. He doesn't have anywhere to go (not strong enough for 2NT, no diamond support).|

The moral of the story is: if you are going to make a Negative Double with only one of the two unbid majors (or minors), make sure you know what you will do if partner bids the one you don't have.  You do not have to have both unbid suits, but if you only have one of them then you need to have a plan.|

HT|f|fp||cp||AT|^B@2^Y@3Negative Doubles are a valuable tool for helping us to handle certain types of competitive auctions. One key element towards understanding and using them correctly is to know exactly when a double is (or is not) a Negative Double.

Luckily for us, basic Negative Doubles occur in a very specific set of circumstances:
^c1. Our partner opens the bidding 1-of-a-suit
^C@2^Y@32. The next opponent makes a natural suit overcall (it can be a preemptive jump overcall, as long as it's natural and one-suited). The overcall also has to be below the level that your partnership has agreed to play Negative Doubles through 3@S or 4@D are popular cut-off points)
^C@2^Y@33. If responder then doubles, it is a Negative Double.|

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the backward arrow   ^$6   in the BBO toolbar. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click   ^$40   button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to as you experience it at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A one^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a two^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-
