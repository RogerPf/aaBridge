After our Right Hand opponent (RHO) opens a SUIT, depending on our distribution, we might have something to say with as few as 5 HCP. We need to learn how to say it—taking the fork—without getting in trouble. |

^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Pass. You lack 4-card spades and you have 4-3-3-3 distribution. You are vulnerable and have three cards in opponents' suit.

If West passes, your partner will be well positioned to balance, and he can and should do so even with only 8 or 9 points.|

NT|^B@2   
You also may be able to back into the auction later. For example, if it goes 1@H-P-2@H-P-P-?, now you can make a takeout double. That is a "balancing" double which does not guarantee 4 spades (nor opening strength).|

I know I advocate the "bid early and bid often" style. But, in order to play that style, you need to have what you promise when you do bid. Granted, sometimes you are stuck, and have to lie a bit, but on this hand there is no reason to do so.|mb|p|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NAn important consideration in deciding whether or not to make a takeout double is whether the hand is appropriate for and overcall. Therefore, to better understand takeout doubles we need a basic understanding of simple overcalls.|

To that end, let me quot from a lesson by Richard Strickland, BBO nickname "richarldrls" from 2008—with his recent minor modifications. some experts may not fully agree with his disciplined style but in my humble opinion a disciplined style for me is profitable "more often than not" to borrow the words from my mentor Howard.

^B@2^*BRichard: ^*N|cp||at|REQUIREMENTS IN POINTS FOR AN OVERCALL:
It must be made in a 5-card suit and at the one level you need from 8 to about 15, at the two level you need from about 10 to about 15, and at the three level 12 to 15 would be nice. The requirements changes some when you are overcalling in a pass out seat. Your primary purpose in making an overcall is to show the suit so the suit quality really matters. The suit must have 3 of 5 honors with one must be Ace or King such as:|

PG| ***** 50 ***** |


AT|

anything else and the suit  AIN’T WORTH MENTIONING. Sometimes, you will have that wonderful suit to overcall but your hand will be way too strong for a simple overcall. In this case, you must take a different action -- this is where the takeout double comes into play.|

at|^b@2There is one problem with making a takeout double with the second hand. This hand has only 2-card support for diamonds. But with 23 HCP you cannot pass. The only option is a takeout double provided that your partnership plays the takeout double that high—more on this topic later..

st||pn|Partner,,You,|md|2,,,|sv|o|rh||ah|Is it a takeout?|ah|Example 7|mb|1HP2HPPx|lb|*yIs the double a Takeout^^y|NT|^B@2
Another balancing takeout double. The purpose of a balancing bid or double is to avoid selling out too cheaply to the opponents. You need not have opening strength to make a balancing double -- you are essentially bidding both yours and your partner's cards. |
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Based on the auction, the high card strength is approximately even between the 2 sides. Therefore, even if you have as few as 7 or 8 points, you should consider making a balancing double (if you have the appropriate distribution), because partner likely has at least 9 or 10 points. Conversely, partner must also remember that you are balancing, and must not "punish" you for balancing by overbidding even with a relatively good hand.|

^B@2^*BBarbara Seagram: ^*N|cp||at|There are three types of hand on which you can make a takeout double. What can be regarded as a "normal takeout double" is  by far the most common of these three hand types and has the following requirements:|

HT|t|at|^B3. Shortness in the Opponent’s suit ( at most a doubleton)|

The purpose of the normal takeout double is to show a hand with sufficient strength to wish to compete in the bidding and to ask partner to choose his best from the three unbid suits. As we shall see later, there is no upper limit for your strength when you make a takeout double. However, to qualify as a "normal takeout double" your hand must fit all three requirements. Let us therefore start with the kind of hand on which you cannot double.|

^*BBarbara Seagram: ^*N|cp||at|You should not say "double"; partner is too likely to bid hearts. You are not strong enough to bid twice, and your partner will not approve if you put this hand down in dummy having promised support for all of the unbid suits.|mb|p|

^*BBarbara Seagram: ^*N|cp||at|When you have a decent 5-card major you should usually choose to overcall, even though your hand may qualify for a double by the other criteria. The primary reason for this is that partner will not bid a three-card suit in response to your double, and thus you will not be able to find your 5-3 fit. Remember, doubling and then bidding your major shows a very good hand.|

^*BBarbara Seagram: ^*N|cp||at|There are two other hand types on which you can also start with a double. Basically, these are the two types of hand that are too strong for any other action.|
PG| ***** 96 ***** |


ht|i|at|^B@21. A very strong one—suited hand. Double then bid your suit next round (16+ points and a six-card suit, or 18+ points and five-card suit)|
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


ht|k|at|^B@22. A hand too strong to overcall 1N. Double then bid notrump next round (19+ points and a balanced hand)|

^*BBarbara Seagram: ^*N|cp||at|Double is the correct bid. You are too strong for an overcall. If you overcall 1@S, you will miss game when partner has a few scattered values but short in spades. If you overcall 4@S, you will miss slam when partner has just the right cards. (A 4@S overcall would be preemptive and show more spades but fewer aces — usually less than 10 HCP and at least seven and often eight spades). |

^*BBarbara Seagram: ^*N|cp||at|There is no rush with hands this strong. Start slowly with a double, conserving bidding space, so that you can investigate fully. As we have seen, when you double and later bid your own suit, you are showing a very good hand.|mb|x|

^*BBarbara Seagram: ^*N|cp||at|For this kind of hand: 16+ points and a six-card suit, or 18+ points with a five-card suit. It’s easy for partner to tell when you have this type of hand rather than a normal takeout double, because you will bid your own suit over his response.|mb|X|

^*BBarbara Seagram: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss the strong balanced hands which you need to start with a takeout double. These hands are easy, however — you just count your HCP and bid the appropriate number of notrump in the same way that you do as the opener or responder in unopposed auctions. With 15-18 HCP you would have overcalled 1NT immediately over 1 suit opening—with stopper in that suit. |

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NPlease don't expect any examples for type III hands because they occur as often as state of California elects a Republican to the US Senate. Both California U.S. Senate seats have been held by Democrats since 1962. I know. Now I live in a small reservation in Southern California. And in 1962 I stepped out of my spaceship and walked on shores of Queens, New York City. There, pale face natives took me to a place called JFK instead of Ellis Island -:).
