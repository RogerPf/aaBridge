^B@2^*BMM: ^*NBefore we look at Howard's teaching on this section I would like to quote two section from "TAKE OUT DOUBLE AND RESPONSES" by lrargerich which I have saved in 2007. I always admired his take no-prisoners style.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Blrargerich: ^*N|cp||at|1 level contracts require only 7 tricks. So unless you can call an ambulance before passing 1x doubled don't do it. My advice is that you should have 6 trumps to pass 1x doubled and 5 trumps to pass 2x doubled. Many bad things can happen. They may win 1x doubled when your side has a part score. They can go down 1 when you had a game available, etc. So I pass with 6 trumps at the 1 level or with 5 at the 2 level. I usually want to have GOOD texture in the suit. For example A5432 is not good at all to pass a takeout double. JT987 is better than A5432 because the ace will take a trick in defense and will also take a trick if you play the hand. While the JT987 won't take a trick if you play in a suit but can take 2 in defense.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Blrargerich: ^*N|cp||at|1NT is always constructive so please never bid 1NT with nothing. When we have a very bad hand and partner has doubled 1m we pick the best major we have and bid 1M. We should even prefer 1H with 3 cards to say 1NT or 2@C when we have nothing. That's why we need some way do distinguish 0 HCP from say 9 HCP. Otherwise partner won't know what to do. The most standard approach is:|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|The most important thing to remember is that you cannot pass over a takeout double, even if you have a bad hand—MM may have to call 911 -:). Partner is demanding that you bid, and understands that you may not have a very good hand. The most common method of responding to takeout doubles is (assuming your right hand opponent has passed):|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


HT|h|at|^B@21) With less than 9 points, bid a 4 card major if you have one; otherwise bid your best minor.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


HT|h|at|^B@21) With less than 9 points, bid a 4 card major if you have one; otherwise bid your best minor.|
HT|i|at|^B@22) With an intermediate hand, jump one level, preferring a 4 card major over a minor suit. For example, bid 2@S or 3@C if partner has doubled a 1@H opener.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


HT|h|at|^B@21) With less than 9 points, bid a 4 card major if you have one; otherwise bid your best minor.|
HT|i|at|^B@22) With an intermediate hand, jump one level, preferring a 4 card major over a minor suit. For example, bid 2@S or 3@C if partner has doubled a 1@H opener.|
HT|k|at|^B@23) With an opening hand, you have game. Let partner know this by cue bidding the opponent's opening suit. For example, bid 2@H if partner has doubled a 1@H bid.|

^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|I would like to jump in and add a few words to what Howard has told us. Responding to takeout doubles is an area that is misunderstood (or was never properly learned) by inexperienced players. It is very important to study and observe this standard set of responses to takeout doubles. Responding to partner’s takeout double can be summarized in two sentences:|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|If right hand opponent bids, then responder is relieved of having to bid. (No ambulance ride if he passes -:). Therefore, any suit bid by responder should show some values, and should be treated as ^*Bforcing^*N by the takeout doubler. The only exception is redouble -- in that case, the opponents have the majority of the points, so if responder has a clear preference for one suit, it should be bid, and the takeout doubler should not consider this bid forcing (in fact, takeout doubler should virtually always pass).|

^*BBarbara Seagram: ^*N|cp||at|If you like, imagine that partner has already bid hearts too (although it is not as if he has opened 1H, promising five of them). Now that your opponent has bid one of partner’s suits, a double is for penalties it shows hearts and some positive values. Perfect!|MB|X|

^*BBarbara Seagram: ^*N|cp||at|The opponents will rarely play in hearts, but your bid shows values as well as hearts, and partner may be able to double them somewhere else. Also, just because RHO has four small hearts does not mean that you should necessarily avoid playing in the suit—hearts may still be your best trump suit!|
