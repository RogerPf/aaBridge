FP||CS||CP||at|
This tutorial on Responsive Doubles is a BBO movie based on many various sources mainly from ^*IMarty Bergen's Secrets To Winning Bridge - Modern Doubles^*N, from Doubles by Larry Cohen |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/9epruw^*N|CP||AT|, and from wednesdaygame.com |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/5cpruw^*N|CP||AT|. Further, Howard Schutzman, BBO nickname "hondo717" our mentor - |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/^*N|CP||AT| - had the last words in constructing, shaping, and editing it. For the knowledge I have gained and the help, I am thankful. Please note that this is a basic information and serious students of the game need to review the mentioned sources along with many others.|

According to Marty Bergen Responsive Doubles, ".. are takeout doubles after the opponents bid and raise a suit and partner has bid or doubled. Larry Cohen labels Responsive Double "Cousin of the takeout double. It is used by the takeout doubler's partner." Let us look at a few examples:|

mb|x|an|take out double|at| your partner doubles,|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


at| and your right hand opponent raises.|MB|2d?|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|^B@2
Depending on your hand's value and distribution you have several options. First, you are not likely to hold much value in your hand. The opponents probably have 18 to 22 HCP - West opened, Partner doubled and East raised. Nevertheless, at low levels with good distribution you can double (Responsive Double) with values just above 6 to 7 HCP. You need more HCP to double at higher levels.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||mb|x|an|Responsive Double|at|^B@2
You probably doubled with a hand as is shown above.|MD|0sqj65hk432d43cQt9,0,0,0|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With this hand it happened that you hold four cards in both majors. But you can double with only one 4-card major. You know that by a takeout double bid, partner should have at least seven cards in both majors (4-3 or 3-4).|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So, in this auction you are telling partner "I am too strong to pass, I cannot bid 2N, but wish to play partscore in one of your majors. You get to choose." |

Let us change your hand a little.|

Again, your hand is too strong and you do not have a stack of diamonds to pass.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With a good stopper in diamonds (which you do not have) you could bid 2N.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With a poor suit and not enough HCP you do not like to bid clubs at three level.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |

ST||MD|2sk8hjt6d432ca9543,,,|sv|o|rh||ah|Responsive Double|AH|Board 4|NT|^B@2
Of course if you were holding this hand and the bidding was as is shown above, |mb|1d1h2d|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |

pg| ***** 19 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Next, let us look at what level a double is Responsive Double.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


nt||

%%b5
ST||MD|2,,,|sv|o|rh||ah|Responsive Double|AH|Board 5|NT|^B@2
Most experts play Responsive Doubles up to the 4-level, typically 4@D. Therefore, in this auction,|mb|1dx4dx|an|Responsive Double|at| the double is a Responsive Double.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On the other hand, Larry Cohen says, "As with all doubles, there is no upper limit. If the opponents bid and raise to a high level, you can be sure they have lots of trumps. It makes no sense to define double as Penalty." If it bidding goes as |UB|4|mb|1sx4sx|at| is shown now,|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|^B@2
or if it is like|UB|4|MB|1s2h4sx|at| the one you see now.|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The the doubles by you are Responsive Doubles - as high as 4@S.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||AT|
^B@2^*BMM: ^*NHowever, It is possible that Mr. Cohen has modified his style since he wrote the piece on Responsive Double - note the last 2 quizzes. Next, Mr. Schutzman will clarify the issue. Also he has additional explanation for the Responsive Double.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BSchutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Let me clarify what Larry Cohen means when he says doubles at the 4-level are responsive. Most experts play all doubles of 4 level bids are "value showing". They are neither pure penalty nor pure takeout. They say, "Partner, I have some values and this hand belongs to us. Do something intelligent. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BSchutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Pass if you think we are beating it and we have no better spot. Bid if you have the distribution and values such that you think it is better if we play the hand." |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BSchutzman: ^*N|cp||at|It is not always easy for partner to decide what to do (which is why the opponents preempted in the first place), but that does not change the meaning of the double.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BSchutzman: ^*N|cp||at|On related topic, the Responsive Doubles presented here are what most people play -- that is they only occur when partner makes a bid and the opponents bid and raise. |
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BSchutzman: ^*N|cp||at|However, a few people play that Responsive Doubles are on whenever there are 2 remaining unbid suits. In particular, this can happen when partner makes a takeout double. Thus, in the auction 1@C-x-1@S-x, you can play that the 2nd double is still Responsive because hearts and diamonds are both unbid. |
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BSchutzman: ^*N|cp||at|However, 1C-1D-1S-x is not responsive, since only hearts are unbid (although some people still play that the double in that auction does show hearts with a weakish hand; I do not.)|

Partner's bid is Responsive Double showing some value. South knows you have 4 spades and does not necessarily deny 4 spades. But it does say that if you have a 5-card minor or even a nice 4-card minor, you should bid it. You are allowed to bid spades, but South will often correct to a minor, showing a weakish hand with a long minor (think of this as being similar to a "negative double and correct").|

Partner obviously would like you to bid heart which may be dangerous at four level. When you double (Responsive Double) it send the message that you are interested in playing in one of the minors. So double. Please note the logic behind the Responsive Double. If your LHO opened with a suit, Partner then overcalled or doubled, and your RHO raised Opener's suit, then Double is Responsive, a bid that is trying to find a fit.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|FYI, Bergen-Cohen play this as a "thrump" double, asking pard to bid 3N with a spade stopper. And even if this is "responsive", it shows good values (you are forcing to 3N or higher) and partner should still bid 3N with a spade stopper. |

On the basic issue, things are not much different. You need to double (Responsive Double) when the opponents are bidding and raising and when Partner has either overcalled or made a takeout double. So bid double.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NBTW, Howard's FYI also is appropriate here. "Bergen-Cohen play this as a "thrump" double, asking pard to bid 3N with a heart stopper. And even if this is "responsive", it shows good values (you are forcing to 3N or higher) and partner should still bid 3N with a spade stopper."|

Pass is the bid. And Howard says, "In fact this hand would like to be able to make a penalty double with 4 hearts and a singleton spade, but cannot since double is responsive. The lack of a club stopper is not the issue for bidding 3N. It is the lack of HCP. With 11+ HCP, even lacking a club stopper, 3N would be a good bid.|

Larry Cohen: Pass. You aren't likely to get dealt a hand like this, but you just have to bite the bullet and pass (and blame me that double is not for penalty). With luck, partner, who is likely short in spades, will double again for takeout and you can convert it for penalties.|

Just picture the horse looking back at the person who is doing the shoeing. You will get the drift. -:) The look says:|
