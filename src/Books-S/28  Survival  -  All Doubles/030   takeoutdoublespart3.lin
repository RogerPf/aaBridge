^-|ht|e|qx|BRD, beginning|CS||CP||fp||at|^b@2In this section we are going to be on the receiving side. Partner opens a suit and the RHO doubles. Without RHO putting his nose in our tent we could have been in a cushy constructive bidding. But now we are in competitive bidding where things are greatly different. 

Howard Schutzman covers this issue in his March and April 2012 lesson series in BIL - "Bidding over Opponent's Takeout Doubles." The lessons are converted to a BBO movie - "Raises In Competition" - which you can find either in BIL library at |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bilbridge.com^*N|CP||AT| or in Howard's web site at |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/^*N|CP||AT|. The link to the BBO movie is |CP|1|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=raisesincompetition^*N|CP||AT|.

In synopsis, a condensed version of Howard's lessons will be presented in three following sections. Please click one of the blue links below to start that section. You can return to this page afterward. Or just click the forward arrow and begin the synopsis from the start.

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|One important point I like to emphasize first is that a new bid by responder, after opponent's double, shows less than 10 points. For example 1@H-x-2@C is less than 10 points - keep that in mind. |
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

Some people play something slightly more complicated, which I do not particularly care for. All one level bids over the double are forcing and can be made with 10+ points, but 2 level bids are not. I find that very counter-intuitive and confusing. Using that system 1@D-x-1@S can be and often is stronger than  1@D-x-2@C.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT| 

The second important note is the 1@H/1@S-double-1N. In this auction 1NT promises 8-11.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|

The third important note is that Bergen Raises are off after competition (unless you agree otherwise). I will discuss this topic later.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT| For ease of explanation let us divide the responder's hand (your hand in quizzes) in two categories:|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


hT|m|AT|^CA. Hands with 6-9 points.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


hT|m|AT|^CA. Hands with 6-9 points.
^cB. Hands with 10+ points.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


at|

In category A - with 6-9 and support for partner's suit you bid based on the Law of Total tricks.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


AT|
Bid 2 with 3-card support (just like after an overcall).|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


AT|
Bid 3 with 4-card support and less than a limit raise. In competition you want to play weak jump raises. Remember the Law of Total Tricks is your friend :).|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


AT|
Bid 4 with 5-card support.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


AT|

In category B - with 10+ points you redouble with 3-card support.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


AT|
You should bid 2NT (Jordan 2NT) with 4-card support and limit raise or better.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


AT|

Some experts recommend bidding redouble with 10 points holding less than 3-card support and bid 2NT with 3+ card support and limit raise or better. |
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


AT|

Let us look at some examples for 1 of a major followed by takeout double. Bergen Raises are off (unless you agree otherwise).|

^b@2Bid 2@D. Many players think the auction 1@H-X-2@D promises 10 points in responder's hand. That is absolutely incorrect. If you have 10 points, you redouble. Therefore, any suit bids show less than 10 points and a suit worth mentioning.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Many experts play Bergen Raises are off after competition. But I think you can and should play they are on, although that is not standard. Therefore, if you play Reverse Bergen Raises 3@C is 10+ 4-card support, and 3@D is 7-9 with 4 card support. I recommend you play Jordan 2N is a 3-card raise (since 3@C is a 4-card raise). All these bids are now alertable. Next there are a few examples.|

^b@2Bid 2N. Remember I said, if you play Bergen, that frees up 2N to show a 3-card raise. Any time you can differentiate between a 3 and 4 card limit raise, that is good. That is what I prefer but you have to agree with your partner.|

^-{    Bidding Over 1 of a Minor after a Takeout Double    }
^-|CP||FP||CS||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|The responses after minor suit openings are basically similar to what you do after an overcall. First a few important points to remember.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


AT|

Inverted Minor Raises are off.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


AT|

If you have a nice major bid it. But remember the doubler tends to promise the major, so don't bid a weak suit. You only need 4 cards, but you should have at least a couple of honors. And of course the redouble rule applies, so if you bid 1 of a major you have less than 10 points.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


AT|

Here again redouble is the only way to show 10 points. You bid 1N with 8-11 points and you should bid 2N with five card support and 10+ points. Weak jump shifts and weak raises are highly recommended. We can get a better understanding of the bidding with the following examples.|
