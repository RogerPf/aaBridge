^-|HT|c|va|4|CP||FP||at|There are many similarities between UNT and Michaels Cuebids.|
PG| ***** 0 ***** |


AT| A ^*Bdirect cuebid^*N of one of the opponent's natural bid is a Michaels Cuebid. It requires an appropriate two-suited hand. The two suits promised usually are at least 5-5. The partner is asked to bid one of the two suits promised.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT| There is no confusion whether the ^*Bdirect cuebid^*N is Michaels or not-other variants notwithstanding.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT| However, not all experts play the ^*Bdirect cuebid^*N of a Weak-Two or a Weak-Three and when the cuebid is not a ^*Bdirect cuebid^*N the same. First let me share with you what Mr. Marty Bergen says before we look at some examples.|

When the opponents have bid two suits, a cuebid of Opener's suit promises the other two suits, while a cuebid of responder's suit is natural, showing an extremely good suit and a decent hand - Howard plays both as Michaels.|

^B@2Some players only use Michaels on weak hands (<10 points) and strong hands (around 16+ points). With the intermediate two-suited hands with 11-15 points, they bid the higher-ranking suit first and hope they can rebid the other suit at their next turn. Other players simply use Michaels on hands of all point ranges, believing that it is more important to immediately show shape than to only show one suit first and then hope the auction allows them to show the other suit and their 11-15 point range. By inference "points" = HCP.|

Over an opening Weak-Two bid, a cuebid ^*Busually^*N promises two unspecified suits and a good hand, with at least five cards in each suit. For example:|

PG| ***** 15 ***** |


ht|h|va|6|AT|^m@23D by North is Michaels, but since it is over a pre-empt it only promises a good hand with two suits other than diamonds. Partner is expected to bid 3H with heart tolerance. Hopefully the cuebidder can clarify which two suits he holds at his next opportunity; if he has spades and clubs, for example, he can now bid 3S or 4C.|

ht|p|AT|^m@23D is Michaels, showing hearts and spades. Note that since partner is being forced to bid now at the three-level with a major suit fit not guaranteed, the cuebidder should have a very good hand. |

You have a weak distributional hand. Your options are Pass or 2C (Michaels cuebid showing the two majors). Most experts use Michaels cuebid to show a relatively weak, distributional hand with at least five cards in each major. The better the distribution, the more aggressive they can afford to be. This would be an acceptable hand to cuebid 2C if non-vulnerable. A fit at the two level is highly likely even if North has only a doubleton heart. |mb|2c|

If vulnerable, however - as shown above, and your opponents are not, you might consider bidding Pass.|mb|p|

The distribution is perfect for a Michaels cuebid - 5/5 in the major suits. However, the hand is strong (mid range) for a Michaels cuebid. You do not have to bid Michaels cuebid just because you have the fitting distribution. Make a simple overcall of 1S. You are strong enough to introduce your hearts suit even if West does raise to the two or three level.|mb|1s|

Again an expert North could have used the Law of Total Tricks and bid 3H reporting the presence of a 9-card fit. However, we are trying to prove a point and after all "Movie Maker" could be sitting North. Well Howard opined, "3H is pretty clear. I am quite sure "Movie Maker" would make that LOTT bid :)."|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The just mentioned caution about using the Michaels cuebid with an intermediate-strength hand of 12 to 16 points doesn't apply when you have a very strong distributional hand - addressed in the next board.|

You wish to insist on playing in a major suit. The Michaels cuebid convention will get you there. You'll find out which major North prefers, and then you can raise to game.|mb|2c|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The Michaels cuebid is used either with a relatively weak distributional hand (mini if you will) with both majors or a very strong hand (maxi) with both majors. For hands in mid range you should use a simple overcall. Of course there are experts who play Michaels with intermediate-strength hands as well.|

After a minor opening - 1C here - Michaels convention should be only used with at least five cards in each major. Bidding 2C (Michaels cuebid) can get you in a poor contract as Partner might have to bid 2S with only two or three spades. So, either Pass or make an overcall of 1H, showing your five-card suit. Most experts also insist that you should have 5/5 distribution.|

You have a two-suited hand but you cannot use the Michaels convention. A cuebid of opening one of a minor ALWAYS shows both major suits, not spades and diamonds. Make a simple overcall of 1S, the higher-ranking of the two five-card suits. It is possible that you can show your other suit next. |

Bid 2D. The immediate cuebid of the opponent's minor suit promises both majors and in most instances a weak hand. This bid at favorable vulnerability doesn't carry much risk since North is likely to have a fit with at least one of the major suits. It carries more risk when vulnerable. This is very similar to the earlier example where the bidding was 1C-2C|

Bid 1S. This hand does not have the proper distribution for a Michaels cuebid. Further, its strength is mid-range. Overcall in the longer suit. You may get to show the hearts later in the auction.|

st||RH||ah|9|MD|4SKJ987 H 98 D -  CA 98765,,,|SV|o|MB|1H|lb|*bWhat would you bid?^^2H|MB|2H|NT|^B@2
A cuebid of 2H would show a two-suited hand with spades and an unspecified minor suit. With this weak hand by bidding 2H, you are possibly committing the partnership to the two level or the three level if partner doesn't have a fit for spades. On the other hand Pass is another option. You don't have to use the Michaels convention. It's a tool you have available.|

You cannot cuebid 2D because that would show both major suits. This is an awkward hand to bid and requires some judgement. Pass, 1S, or 2C are the options. But all have flaws. Many experts may bid Pass|

^-{        Summary         }
^-|HT|d|fp||CP||at|^B@2^Z@3When the opponent on your right opens the bidding at the one level in a suit, you can use the Michaels cuebid convention to show a two-suited hand:

• A direct cuebid of opener's minor suit shows both major suits.

• A direct cuebid of opener's major suit shows the other major and an unspecified minor suit. 

• You need at least five cards in both suits and either a relatively weak distributional hand  -  less than the high-card strength for an opening bid  -  or a very strong distributional hand with which you intend to bid again after hearing partner's response.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |

BTW, the Michaels cuebid is the brainchild of the late Mike Michaels. 

A bid of a suit which was originally called by one of the opponents = cuebid. |
