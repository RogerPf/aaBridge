qx|B1|ht|e|cp|4|cs|1|at|^-{    A Note From the Movie Maker    }
^-|CP||CS||AT|^b@2^Z@3Muareen wished to have a Weak Two Bids tutorial BBO movie in the BIL (Beginner Intermediate Lounge) library for the new students learning bridge and I said, "Maureen the students can Google the topic and get over thousand links containing great information." Nonetheless, she wished to have one made and asked whether I have "saved" suitable material for such tutorial from previous lessons in the BIL. |PG||AT|

I did not have one. But at least I knew of a great learning source which I used several years ago to study the topic—Weak Two Bids in ^*ICommonly Used Conventions in the 21st Century Teacher Manual^*N by ACBL. I believed that it could be the main source for such a tutorial. Asked and received the permission to use the manual—Thank you ACBL and Baron Barclay Bridge Supply. |PG||AT|

I made the manual the structural frame and used many other sources to complete this presentation. I have my references listed in a separate section. The standard rules for direct quotation notwithstanding, I extensively used from those sources and others. I am grateful for their material and ask their forgiveness if I failed to ask for proper permission. |PG||AT|

The tutorial is long and has many quiz sections. I suggest that you review only a section at a time. As usual the experts do not agree on many important guidelines for the Weak Two Bids and I tried to cover the conventional wisdom and the opposing views with greater weight. There is a help section which you should view first if you are not familiar with BBO movie presentation. Also the "help" icon you see either on the top of your screen or to the right of the bottom of the screen can furnish you with more information on how to navigate through this presentation.|PG||at|

So, just sit back, relax and let your fingers do the work—click the Next Page. In most part I ask the Greek deity and super bridge expert (|CP|8|AT|^*BKiamemnon^*N|CP||AT|) questions and the demigod answers. After |CP|8|AT|Kiamemnon^*N|CP||AT|, departure, |cp|8|AT|^*BMartysseus^*N|cp||at| the wisest of all Kings holds court and answers my questions. Do not fear, however, as |cp|8|AT|^*BSchutzmenelaus^*N|cp||at| another deity and bridge expert is helping too.|PG||nt||

qx|B2|ht|e|cp|4|cs|1|at|^-{    General Consideration    }
^-|CS||CP|1|at|^b@2^Z@3Movie Maker(MM): |CP||AT|Thank you Kiamemnon for taking time and coming down from Mount Olympus to our land and answering my questions on Weak Two Bids. I will start with the first soon. Earlier you mentioned that the Weak Two Bids are not new.|PG||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Z@3^*BKiamemnon: ^*N|cp||at|The Weak Two Bid, as you might imagine, is an opening bid at the two level that shows a weak hand, rather than a strong hand. The concept of using opening two-level bids for weak hands has been around since the days of auction bridge—the forerunner of the game of contract bridge that we play today.|PG||AT| 

Harold Vanderbilt, often credited with the invention of contract bridge while cruising aboard a ship in 1925, included Weak Two Bids as part of his Vanderbilt Club System, one of the first complete bidding systems. The modern version of this convention was popularized by Howard Schenken, considered by many people to be the best bridge player of all time.|PG||CP|1|at|
^b@2^Z@3MM: |CP||AT|Very interesting. I am a bit partial to Louis Watson but you know best.|PG||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Z@3^*BKiamemnon: ^*N|cp||at|Let me add. Most hands are opened at the one level, so that the partnership has as much room as possible to search for the best contract. Opening bids at the two level have traditionally been used as strong Two Bids, showing a hand too strong to open at the one level—no longer true. |PG||AT|

However, now opening bids in a suit at the two level (2@D, 2@h, and 2@S) or higher are commonly used to show hands with a long suit, too weak to open at the one level. These are ^*Ipreemptive opening bids^*N and, as you may know, they can make life difficult for the opponents. This tactic has proven so successful that many players today prefer to use methods that allow them to preempt more frequently. I'll show you a few examples. |PG||nt||
%%%page 2
ht|d|CP|1|at|^b@2^Z@3MM: |CP||AT|What do you mean by ^*Ipreemptive opening bids can make life difficult for the opponents.^*N?|PG||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Z@3^*BKiamemnon: ^*N|cp||at|Simple. You crowd out their bidding space and they cannot properly exchange information and arrive at an optimal contract. Better yet, they may over-react and over bid their hand which gives the other side good boards. As an added important benefit it gives good opening lead information to the pre-emptor's partner. The best is giving adequate information to the partner. Armed with good information partner can set the appropriate course and arrive at another and possibly better auction. A Weak Two Bid at first and third seat usually is more powerful. BTW, have you read the good article on Weak Two Bids by Eddie Kantar at|CP|1|AT| ^*Hwww.kantarbridge.com/weak_2s.htm^*N?|PG||CP|1|at|
^b@2^Z@3MM: |CP||AT|Of course I have read it. Let me even quote the part about the The Advantages of Weak Two Bids from that article:|PG||

^b@2^Z@3MM: |CP||AT|That is fine. But the opponents get the same information and can use it against you.|PG||

^B@2^Z@3^*BKiamemnon: ^*N|cp||at|Of course. Weak Two  Bids are high risk-reward and you have to be very careful when and where to use them. I will give you a list of dos and don'ts for now. Then I can explain more when we look at a few hands. So write down the following critical points:|PG||AT|

{      Weak Two Bids     }
^-|ht|c|cs||at||ih|pSAQJT87H87DJT8C87|at| ^mHand 1|ht|c|va|4|CS|6|at|^p{|ia|,?|at|}|hf|i|lb|*bSuppose you are the dealer. NOT playing Weak Two Bids, what would you bid?^^p|ht|c|va|4|CS|6|at|^p{|ia|,p|at|}|ht|h|cp|8|AT|
^*BKiamemnon: ^*N|cp||at|Pass is the correct bid if you were not playing Weak Two. You have 8 high-card points plus 2 length points for the six-card suit. 10 points aren't enough to open the bidding 1@S in first position. |PG||AT|

What about an opening preemptive bid of 3@S? (No seven-card suit.) An opening bid at the three level shows a weak hand, but it usually promises a seven-card suit. With only a six-card suit, it would be dangerous to open 3. The fewer spades you have, the fewer tricks you will take, and the more likely it becomes that the opponents will double you for penalties. |PG||AT|

However, this is a nice hand. You'd like to tell partner something about the spade suit and, at the same time, make the auction more difficult for the opponents. This is the type of hand that competitive players like to open with a Weak Two Bid—2@S. Of course, you and your partner must have agreed to play Weak Two Bids. Otherwise, your partner will expect you to have a very strong hand and will keep bidding until game or slam is reached.|PG||AT|

This hand, however, is a textbook 2@S opening bid. The first feature of this hand is a ^*Bgood^*N six-card suit. Since the 2@S opening bid shows a weak hand, the opponents will be aware of that. It gives them the option of doubling for penalties. The weaker the suit, the more likely that the opponents will have enough strength in the suit to defend and extract a substantial penalty. Also, the weaker the suit, the more difficulty you will have taking tricks. A good suit reduces the risk of being defeated by more tricks than you can afford.|ht|c|at||ih|pSAQJT87H87DJT8C87|at| ^mHand 1|ht|c|va|4|CS|6|at|^p{|ia|,2s|at|}|pg||
 
HT|w|at|The interpretation of a ^*Bgood^*N suit varies among experts, but one factor to bear in mind is the vulnerability. When you are vulnerable, it's more expensive when you go down, especially doubled. If you are vulnerable, a general guideline is that you should have three of the top five honors. Here, you have four of the top five—the Ace, Queen, Jack and ten. This suit would be good enough for a vulnerable Weak Two Bid at any position. When you are not vulnerable, your suit can be weaker. |PG||NT||

{      Weak Two Bids     }
^-|ht|c|cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*BKiamemnon: ^*N|cp||at|Now I will get into the difficult part of Weak Two Bids—HCPs, shape, vulnerability, and position. We cannot set meaningful standards for each without considering all four.|PG||CP|1|at|
^b@2^Z@3MM: |CP||AT|That is the reason why experts vary so much when bidding Weak Two.|PG||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Z@3^*BKiamemnon: ^*N|cp||at|That is correct. Let me address the scoring for penalties and how it is affected by both doubles and vulnerability—assuming you are doubled after a Weak Two Bid and the opponents set you. When non-vulnerable, the penalty scale for doubled undertricks goes 100, 300, 500, 800, 1100, etc. When vulnerable, the scale goes 200, 500, 800, 1100, etc. The value of game for the opponents is approximately 500 points. As a result, you can rarely afford to go down more than three tricks when non-vulnerable or two tricks when vulnerable. When the opponents are non-vulnerable and your side is vulnerable, you want to be especially careful. That means your HCP and suit quality should be at the top of the scale. |PG||CP|1|at|
^b@2^Z@3MM: |CP||AT|That is great information. Before you go further please address the six-card requirement.|PG||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Z@3^*BKiamemnon: ^*N|cp||at|You ask, “Why a six-card suit and not a seven-card suit?" (A seven-card suit is opened 3 level.) With a good seven-card suit and a hand too weak to open at the one level, you usually open a preemptive bid at the three level, rather than the two level. If you have a five-card suit, it's a little dangerous to be opening at the two level—although as you'll see later there are exceptions.|PG||ht|s|AT|^b@2^r@3The other feature of the hand on the right (from the first example) is that it contains too few points to open the bidding 1@S. The point requirement for opening Weak Two varies among the experts. You'll see ranges such as 6 to 10, 5 to 10 or 5 to 11 for a Weak Two Bid. The guideline by Eddie Kantar is 7-9 HCP. Of course ACBL SAYC System Booklet says 5-11 points.|ht|s|va|6|at|^s|ih|SAQJT87H87DJT8C87|PG||ht|v|va|6|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Z@3^*BKiamemnon: ^*N|cp||at|One more point. To use Weak Two Bid, there has to be some way to handle hands which would have been opened with a strong Two Bid. When playing Weak Two Bids, one bid is reserved for all strong hands. The 2@C opening bid is used to handle all strong hands of about 22 or more points.|PG||NT||bt||

^-|ht|c|cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*BKiamemnon: ^*N|cp||at|So, if you play Weak Two Bids, an opening bid of 2@D, 2@H or 2@S shows a good six-card suit and 5 to 10 high-card points. I will go over the suit quality again. With a weak six-card clubs you have to pass. Let's look at more examples.|PG||NT||

^B@2^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|What do you think about this hand? (2@D/Pass.) |PG||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Z@3^*BKiamemnon: ^*N|cp||at|This hand barely qualifies for a weak 2@D bid. Your suit isn't great, but you do have three of the top five honors. You also have 6 high-card points. It's a judgment call. You don't have to open 2D if your hand falls within the range for a 2@D opening. Some players would open 2@D with this hand, some would choose to pass. It is the suit quality issue. However, non-vulnerable and third seat you have a go for 2@D bid.|PG||NT||CP|1|at|^b@2^Z@3MM: |CP||AT|BTW, this is how Eddie Kantar discusses the suit quality.|PG||CP|1|AT| "Suit strength can vary with the vulnerability and seat. ^*IIdeally^*N three or four of the top five honors will head the suit. ^*IPractically^*N, two of the top five honors along with the 9 and 8 or 9 and 7 cards attached will do just fine, thank you. In addition, at favorable vulnerability liberties are allowed, particularly in third seat."|PG||NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3

^-|ht|c|cp|1|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|In a nutshell tell me what might influence your decision in opening Weak Two.|PG||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*BKiamemnon: ^*N|cp||at|There are two—^*BVulnerability^*N and ^*Bposition at the table^*N. Let me give you some of my thoughts.|PG||AT|
^C@2^Z@3^*BVulnerability^*N. If you are vulnerable, you want to be more cautious. If you were doubled for penalties in a Weak Two auction, you might take only three or four tricks if partner has no help. That could be a penalty of 1100 to 1400 points. Even if the opponents can make a slam, they have more to gain by doubling you if they are not vulnerable.|PG||AT| 
^C@2^Z@3^*BPosition at the table^*N. Suppose you are in third position holding the hand we looked at before (shown again below), and you are not vulnerable and the opponents are vulnerable.| 
HT|l|at|^C|ih|1ST8H87DQJT876CK87|pg||ht|l|at|^g@2^Z@3The hand on the left isn't a bad hand to take a chance on opening 2@D. Since partner passed originally, it's very likely that your opponents can make at least a game, perhaps a slam.|pg|| 
ht|p|at|^B@2^Z@3Anything you can do to disrupt their auction may get you a good result. When they are vulnerable and you are not, the opponents will be reluctant to double you. They would have to defeat you four tricks—for a penalty of 800 points—to compensate for the value of their game.|PG||at| 

So, the Weak Two Bid is another tool in your tool kit. You choose the appropriate moment to bring it out and use it. Let us move on. I have to cover more fine points.|PG||NT||

This is where you can get into trouble. First let us see what the so called main stream recommends. With six-card good quality suit and 8 high-card points a Weak Two has merit—bid 2@H. However, the conventional wisdom and probably ACBL have it that South should not bid 2@H because the hand has 4-card major and a void. Let us listen to the reasoning.|PG||NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*BKiamemnon: ^*N|cp||at|As a general guideline, you should not open a hand Weak Two when you have a side four-card major suit ( a weak four-card major is okay) or a void. Your Weak Two Bid may make the auction more difficult for the opponents, but it can also make the auction more difficult for your partner.|PG||NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*BKiamemnon: ^*N|cp||at|It is maintained that when you have a side four-card major suit, there are other possibilities. Partner might have a singleton heart and four or five spades—in this case. Partner won't want to bid spades because that might get the partnership into more trouble. You could go down in a part score in hearts when you could make something—perhaps a game—with spades as trumps.|PG||NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*BKiamemnon: ^*N|cp||at|Also, a void is very powerful and makes it difficult for partner to estimate the playing strength of the combined hands. If partner has something like the Club Queen and two low clubs, partner will be expecting to lose two or three tricks in that suit opposite a normal Weak Two Bid. Partner won't expect that there are no club losers on this hand. |PG||NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*BKiamemnon: ^*N|cp||at|So, the general guideline is to avoid opening a Weak Two Bid when you have a side four-card major suit or a void. It's only a guideline—you're free to exercise your judgment on any hand. As you mentioned, to me, your mentor has rather strong feelings on this topic. Let us look at what he has to say.|PG||cp|1|AT|

^B@2^*BSchutzmenelaus: ^*N|cp||at|In first seat, a preempt is odds on to work because if you have a weak hand, that leaves more points for the opponents. A preempt is even more appropriate in third seat since there are 2 passes, and you have a weak hand, it is almost certain that fourth seat has a good hand.|PG||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BSchutzmenelaus: ^*N|cp||at|The only time you should be a little more cautious with a preempt is second seat because then it is more likely that partner has a good hand and you will be preempting partner. If first seat passes, and you have a weak hand, that leaves more points for partner to have. So, if you are worried about preempting partner, only worry about it in second seat.|PG||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BSchutzmenelaus: ^*N|cp||at|Personally, I never worry about it, lol. Remember, the earlier you preempt the more effective it is. The more chance you give the opponents to exchange information, the less effective a preempt is. ^*uOn the other hand, to be ACBL main stream you should follow the rule of two out of three or three out five honors.^*n|PG||at| But my guess would be something like "1 of top 3 and 2 of top 5" is more main stream these days. |PG||NT||cp|1|AT|
^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|Those comments are from 2009. Now let me share with you what Eddie Kantar wrote in his June 2011 updated article on Weak Two Bids.|PG||NT|^B@2
"Suit strength can vary with the vulnerability and seat. Ideally three or four of the top five honors will head the suit. Practically, two of the top five honors along with the 98 or 97 attached will do just fine, thank you. |PG||NT|^B@2
Suits that look like: AK10765, AK9732, KQ9732, AJ9843, QJ10432, KJ9765 are fine. In addition, at favorable vulnerability liberties are allowed, particularly in 3rd seat."|CP|1|AT|  ^*Hwww.kantarbridge.com/weak_2s.htm^*N|CP||pg||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BSchutzmenelaus: ^*N|cp||at|I believe that you can and should open a weak 2 with an outside 4-card major. The argument for not opening is that you might miss a 4-4 major suit game, but there are very few deals where opening a weak 2 with a 4-card major will cause your side to miss game. Even with a 4-4 fit, on most hands, you will be better off playing in your 6-card suit -- extra trump length is a big asset when playing in a suit contract. Weak 2@S are very good bidding weapons, and should be employed whenever possible. |PG||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BSchutzmenelaus: ^*N|cp||at|They are much less effective if you pass originally and perhaps come in later, because then you have given the opponents a chance to exchange information at a low level. For the few hands where you might  miss a 4-4 major suit game by opening a weak 2, there are many more hands where you would have gained had you opened a weak 2 and failed to do so because of your 4-card major. Marty Bergen also believes there is nothing wrong with opening a weak 2 with an outside 4-card major.|PG||cp|1|AT|

^-|ht|c|cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3Kiamemnon: ^*N|cp||at|I think by now you have a good grasp of Weak Two Bids as to point range, quality of the suit and how to effectively use them.  Next, let us look at why a so-called pesky Weak Two preempt can make life difficult for the opponents.  I would like to remind you, however, that such an outcome is not always true.  Occasionally it works as a boomerang.  Please see the following board.|PG||nt||
%%%%% Board
ST||MD|1,SJ87 HQ J876DK8CA J8,,|sv|o|rh||AH|Hand E1|mb|p?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3Kiamemnon: ^*N|cp||at|You are West and South (the Dealer) passes.|pg||lb|*bPlease make your bid.^^1h|mb|1h|at| That is easy. You have 12 high-card points plus 1 for the five-card suit, enough to open the bidding 1@H. You've started to describe your hand to partner, and you'll see where the bidding takes you from there.|PG||NT|^B@2
Now, to prove a point let us suppose South opens 2@S instead of passing.|pg||UB|2|mb|2s|at| What would you bid now?|PG||at| Does South's bid affect your bidding?|PG||AT| Absolutely.|PG||AT| You do not see his hand but everyone at the table has a fairly good idea what he has--a weak hand with six-card spades as is shown next.|pg||md|0SAKT532H4DJT65C56,0,0,0|PG||NT|^B@2
When South opens the bidding with a Weak Two, you have three choices. If you want to come into the bidding, you can overcall at three level or you can make a takeout double. You also can pass.|PG||NT|^B@2
A three-level overcall should be based on a good six-card or longer suit and better than your minimum hand. Further, you are poorly placed to step into the middle of the auction. You know nothing about your partner's hand. North, on the other hand, has a good description of South's hand. North also is in a good position to double you for penalties if you step out of line.|PG||NT|^B@2
Say you make a takeout double. Fair enough. However, a takeout double generally shows support for the other three unbid suits. You have good support for hearts and some support for clubs, but what if partner chooses 3@D after your takeout double?|PG||NT|^B@2
You probably say you could correct the 3@D to 3@H. But that is compounding your error as double and correct promises a much stronger hand than you have.|PG||NT|^B@2
You have to admit that the 2@S bid by South has given you no alternative except making a Pass as anything else is very risky.|PG||AT| Nevertheless, let us look at what could happen if you bid 3@H.|MB|3h|PG||AT| North doubles with the hand shown above, along with East's hand.|mb|dppp|md|0,0,S6HA KTH3 DAQ74 CK Q79,0|PG||AT| The double should not be a surprise, however.|PG||md|0,0,0,SQ94H952D932CT234|at| If this is the full hand, the defenders will defeat the contract at least four tricks. The penalty would be greater than any score North/South would get if West stays put after the Weak Two bid by South.|PG||NT|^B@2
The result would not be any better if West makes a takeout double.|Ub|5|pg||MB|dp|PG||AT| East would probably bid 3@C,|MB|3c|PG||AT| and that is even worse than 3@H.|MB|ppdppp|PG||AT| Whatever East–West do after the Weak Two bid by South, North is likely to double and extract a sizeable penalty.|PG||NT|^B@2
West's safest option is to pass. The auction isn't over yet, and East might hold a better hand and come into the auction.|PG||NT|| 

st||sk|e|md|1SAKT532H4DJT65C56,SJ87HQJ876DK8CA J8,s96ha532dq742cq97,SQ4Hkt9Da93CTk234|sv|o|rh||AH|Hand E1a|NT|^B@2
Let us keep the hands for South and West the same and tweak the hand for East as shown above. Also assume, for the purpose of making a point, that East is the dealer.|pg||lb|*bWhat would East bid?^^1c|at| East most likely would open this hand 1@C.|PG||AT| However, in this auction South is the dealer and bids 2@S which both West and North pass.|pg||MB|2sPP?|nt||lb|*bWhat should East bid?^^p|NT|^B@2
East has the same dilemma West had. East can pass, make a takeout double or overcall 3@C. |PG||NT|^B@2
Takeout double is not advisable—three-card support for hearts and diamonds. East has only so-so support for both hearts and diamonds. If partner picks hearts, for example, East may be in a 4–3 fit at the three level—and after South's 2@S opening bid, it's more than likely that hearts are breaking badly.|PG||NT|^B@2
3@C overcall is dangerous. With only a five-card suit—and not a very good one at that. It would be very dangerous to introduce it at the three level. In addition, your spade Queen is of dubious value once South opens 2@S. As you've just seen, even though South has a weak hand, North could still have a strong hand. So, what is East likely to do with this hand?|PG||AT| Passing seems like the best option.|PG||AT| Let's see how this works out.|mb|ppp|SK||PG||NT|^B@2  
What's going to happen to South in the 2@S contract?|PG||AT| South will probably finish with eight tricks and make the contract. With spades breaking 3–2, South will probably lose one spade trick, two diamond tricks and two club tricks. South makes 2@S.|PG||NT|^B@2 
On the other hand, what would have happened if South had passed originally?|Ub|6|pg||MB|P|PG||AT| West would open the bidding 1@H,|MB|1hP|PG||AT| and East would respond 2@C.|MB|2cP3cp4hppp|PG||AT| East has enough strength to take the partnership to the game level in hearts, but an immediate raise would show four-card or longer support.|PG||NT|^B@2
Even if South now comes in with an overcall of 2@S, it's too late. East knows the partnership has an eight-card heart fit and enough combined strength for game. East will get the partnership to 4H.|PG||NT|^B@2
How would East–West fare in a contract of 4H? West might make that contract. West has three spade losers, but the third loser can be ruffed in dummy or eventually discarded on the club suit. If the defenders lead spades, the spade Jack will become a trick. There's a sure heart loser and there's a potential club loser. West will probably have to guess which defender holds the club Queen in order to make the contract. |PG||NT|^B@2
Not a bad 4@H contract. Without the 2@S opening bid, North might even lead a club on opening lead, taking away the guess. If South does overcall 2@S, declarer is most likely to play North for the club Queen—since South has long spades and didn't open the bidding.|PG||NT|^B@2
So, South's 2@S bid is a success. South will make 2@S when the opponents have a reasonable chance of making game in hearts. Even if East–West were to go down in 4@H, the penalty would be less than the score North–South receives for making 2@S.|PG||NT|^B@2
In conclusion you can see how the Weak Two Bid might be effective. It takes up just enough bidding room to make the auction difficult for the opponents. They have to start making decisions at the two or three level.|PG||NT|^B@2
Should you expect such a result all the time? Not really. But it happens more often than not.|PG||NT||bt||

^B@2^Z@3MM: ^*N|cp||at|Press on My King. I have been attentive all the time. I am particularly keen to listen to your discussion of how to respond to Weak Two Bids. I know of a few. Howard prefers Ogust. However, he recommends that we to fully discuss it with our partner whatever option we decide to play.|PG||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Z@3Kiamemnon: ^*N|cp||at|Well he is a wise man and he is correct. I will explain those conventions later. However, let us deal with simple stuff first before getting into using gadgets.|PG||AT|

As you already learned, the Weak Two Bid is primarily a defensive type of opening bid. It's designed to make the bidding difficult for the opponents, but it also gives responder a good description of opener's hand. Let's see how responder should handle such a bid. Further, let us suppose that the opponents do not interfere with the bidding. I will address interference later.|PG||AT| When your partner opens a Weak Two and the next player passes, responder must consider his/her options: |PG||AT|^*Bpass, |PG||AT|raise to below game,|PG||AT| raise to game,|PG||AT| bid another suit,|PG||AT| or, possibly consider slam based on hand strength.^*N|PG||AT|

The first two options are what happens in the majority of auctions, and I deal with them first. Let us keep the North-South hands from the last example, which I will bring up next. |PG||cp|1|AT|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|My wise King and favorite of Gods and Goddesses we have been learning that the Law of Total Tricks is the single most important guideline in the competitive bidding. In fact a simple version of it (the Bergen version) says:|PG||AT|
^-
{    IT IS SAFE  TO  COMPETE TO THE SAME  LEVEL AS THE ## OF TRUMPS YOUR SIDE HAS.    }
^-|PG||at|
So if we have an 8-card fit, we can raise to the 2-level (8 trick contract). With a 9-card  fit, we can raise to the 3-level. And with a 10-card fit, we can compete to the 4-level.|PG||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Z@3Kiamemnon: ^*N|cp||at|I am delighted that you know about the Law. The LAW is a really good guideline. It is  much better even than most expert judgement. HCP are irrelevant on most hands. There are occasional hands where it is off by a trick but they are few and far between. Now stop interrupting and let me continue.|PG||nt||

South does not have an opener and is suggesting that spades should be trumps. Therefore, responder should not be interested in a game contract unless responder has more than an opening hand. Responder usually should accept the Weak Two bid, unless there is clearly a better spot.|PG||NT|^B@2
What this means is that responder will usually pass a Weak Two Bid with an average hand and no particularly good fit. Responder will simply be hoping that there's enough combined strength to make the contract or that it won't be defeated too badly. Even with an opening hand or more, responder needs to be cautious about bidding on.  |MB|P|PG||NT||

There are three aces to lose, and even if the trump suit behaves favorably, there is at least one loser in that suit. If the trumps break unfavorably, even 2@S may be difficult to make.|PG||NT||cp|1|AT|^B@2^Z@3MM: ^*N|cp||at|I swear I had my 3N bid right here. Since South has spades stopped, I see no disadvantage to playing in notrump. In fact there is an expert player and teacher who writes about Mel's Rule of 17. He assigns one point for each HCP and one for each card in the suit bid by the partner. He suggests to bid game if the total is equal to 17 or higher. Here North has 17 Mel points and should bid game. |PG||nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3Kiamemnon: ^*N|cp||at|You fail to see that there is no source of tricks. Even a notrump contract is likely to fare badly for North–South when there is no good fit. If South's spades can be established, it is unlikely that there will be an outside entry to reach them. If they can't be established, North will have to produce additional tricks, and unless the defenders are careless, it's unlikely that North can come to more than six or seven tricks.|PG||nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3Kiamemnon: ^*N|cp||at|In fact there are gadgets, I will explain later, which you can use to find out whether a fit is present or not.

North then can double for penalty.|PG||NT||cp|1|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|It appears that whatever style the partnership has should be well discussed. It is important that the Weak Two Bid opener should stick fairly closely to the discussed guidelines. If responder knows that opener has a good suit but not much outside, it's a lot easier for responder to pass with hands we have seen so far.|PG||NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3Kiamemnon: ^*N|cp||at|Since points alone are not a good guideline for when to bid after partner opens a Weak Two Bid, how does responder judge what to do? The best approach is for responder to picture the type of hand opener typically has for the Weak Two Bid and then decide how well the hands fit together. Try to think about the number of tricks your side can take, or the number of losers there are likely to be. Let us now only look at the North hand in the next example with South opening 2@S.|PG||NT||

If partner can bring home the spade suit for no losers, there may be only two losers in diamonds and one in clubs.|MB|4S|PG||AT| Even if partner's spades are @SA J 10 x x x, the contract is at worst on a finesse for the @SK. Let us look at the South hand.|PG||sk||NT|^B@2
As you may have pictured, 4@S is a good contract. If trumps don't behave too badly, declarer has only three diamond losers and a club loser. There are a number of ways to get rid of the third diamond loser—ruff it in dummy, discard it on an extra club winner in dummy if West has the @CA, or take the heart finesse.|PG||NT|^B@2
Even if South's @sK were the @SJ, the contract would have a chance. You'd need the spade finesse. Of course, if South didn't have the @SA, the contract might have no chance, but then South wouldn't have a very good Weak Two Bid. A good fit and distribution are critical to evaluating whether to bid game opposite a Weak Two Bid.|PG||NT||

With five clubs, you can visualize that partner might be short in that suit. Also, if partner has length in diamonds, partner can probably ruff a couple of diamonds in the dummy.|MB|4S|pg||sk||NT|^B@2
4@S isn't a secure contract, but it has a chance. South might get away with one diamond loser and two club losers. Of course, there's lots that could go wrong, but you can see the general idea. It's not so much the high-card points that responder holds, as where they are located and how well the hands fit together.|PG||NT|^B@2
Aces and Kings in the side suits will usually be more effective than Queens and Jacks. Shortness in a side suit will usually be valuable, especially if responder has a good fit for opener's suit.|PG||NT|^B@2
While responder wants to raise to game when the partnership has a good chance of making the contract there are other times when responder may raise to three or even game level. Let us look at another example.|PG||NT||

There are two reasons for jumping to game over partner's Weak Two Bid. One is because you expect to make the contract. The second, Preemptive, is because you expect that the opponents can make a contract, and that whatever penalty your side suffers is likely to be less than the value of the opponents' contract.|PG||NT|^B@2
South has to lose at least one heart trick, one diamond trick and two club tricks. South may have to lose two heart tricks if the @HA is unfavorably placed.|PG||NT|^B@2
Although you cannot make 4@S, what can the opponents make—4@H or more. The opponents can probably take at least 11 tricks in a heart contract. They have at most one spade loser—since they have only three spades between them. |PG||NT|^B@2
They have at most one heart loser, and they can probably avoid that if East has the @HA. They have all the high cards in diamonds and clubs. They could make a slam or even a grand slam if one of them is void in spades.|PG||NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3Kiamemnon: ^*N|cp||at|I can see the look of doubt on your face old man.

You are hoping that they will misjudge the situation. They might double for penalty and get less than the value of their game contract. They might stop in 5@H when they can make a slam, or they might bid 6@H and go down. By jumping to 4@S, you make them guess what to do.|PG||NT||bt||

^-|ht|b|cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3Kiamemnon: ^*N|cp||at|Are you sure you do not know how to play bridge old man? You did well here. As any good player knows, you have to be careful interpreting the responder's bid. The take home is that a new suit and 2NT are forcing bids in response to a Weak Two Bid. A raise to the three level or higher isn't forcing, and opener is expected to pass. But a jump to 3NT or game in another suit also is not forcing. It is to play. So RONF may be a bit misleading.

{      Summary of bids by responder after a Weak Two Bid    }
^-|ht|c|at|^C@2^Z@3The partnership usually plays a response structure termed RONF—Raise is the Only Non-Force. On the surface, this implies that the only non-forcing bid by responder is a raise of opener's suit. In practice, it's a little more complex. A jump to game by responder is also not forcing. It's a sign-off and opener is expected to pass. Also, a raise isn't just non-forcing. It's not invitational. Opener is expected to pass, since responder is the captain. Responder could have either a strong hand or a weak hand when raising opener's suit. The opponents should be guessing what to do, not opener. |PG||AT|

^C@2^Z@3A new suit by responder below game level is forcing. With a fit—usually three-card support but perhaps a doubleton honor—responder should raise. Without a fit, responder rebids the original suit with a minimum and bids something else—a new suit or notrump—with a maximum.|PG||AT| 

^C@2^Z@3A response of 2NT is forcing also, and we'll deal with that next. |PG||NT||

^-|cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*BKiamemnon:  ^*N|cp||at|Although a Weak Two bid is very descriptive, beside being disruptive, there are times when responder needs more information to determine the best contract.

However the hand on the left with 6 HCP is at the bottom and the hand on the right with 10 HCP is at the top of the 5-11 HCP range for Weak Two bids. Further, the hand on the right has a great side suit in hearts. This feature combined with 10 HCP could be a good fit for responder to be in a game—probably in 3N. But how can opener convey this information to the Responder ? |PG||

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If your partner opens a Weak Two, and you bid 2N, that is a conventional bid asking partner for a further description of their Weak Two bid. It asks both about suit quality and HCP. Let me define a few terms important to Ogust convention.|PG||

So, your suit either is "Bad" or "Good" and you either have "Bad" or "Good" hand. Therefore, there are 4 combinations you can talk about "good/bad hand" and "good/bad suit." And, thus there are four responses.|PG||

ht|t|at|So, a minor suit bid shows a bad hand, and a major suit bid shows a good hand point count wise. Therefore, in the hand we just played, I play  that 3@D shows a bad hand with a good suit, and 3@H shows a good hand and a bad suit. However, there is another variation that Leandro plays which simply reverses 3@D and 3@H. In his version 3@D (which is what he bid originally) shows a good hand and a bad suit  and 3@H shows a bad hand and a good suit. In this variation the minors show a bad suit, and the majors show a good suit in his version. I don't think it matters which you play, although I believe, at least in the US, the version I play is more popular. But obviously you need to check with your partner.|PG||cp|1|AT|

^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|Howard, that was great explanation. But let us assume my partner opens a Weak Two (2@D for example) and the next opponent passes. What type of hand do I need to bid conventional 2N?|PG||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Before I get into specific let me give you a key messages of using Ogust convention. You should not overuse Ogust. The law of total tricks and your dummy points often tell you what to do. Ogust only should be used for those in-between hands, which do not occur all that often.|PG||cp|1|AT|
^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|Then, would you please give us your guideline.|PG||
cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me first discuss what to do when partner opens 2@H or 2@S. In that case, your first thought should be whether or not you want to play in game in opener's suit. It is almost always easier to play in a suit, particularly when one hand is weak, than it is to play in NT. And your primary guideline should be the Law of Total Tricks. So, let us say you are on the table and partner bids let us say 2@H and you have the following hands. First, you choose your bid then I will give you my critique and recommendations. I will be your partner. For clarity we are not going to show the entire hand.|PG||cp|1|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you have 4-card support, raise to 4, regardless of how many points you have. This is clear Law of Total Tricks bid, since you know your side has 10 trumps. This is the same reasoning as your jumping to 4 with 5-card support when your partner opens 1 of a major. Occasionally, you might have enough for slam, but that is rare enough that it is not worth worrying about.|PG||NT||

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you have 3-card support and at least 4 points, you should raise to 3 at least. Again, this is based on the Law of Total Tricks (you have 9 trumps, so you are safe bidding a 9 trick contract). Below I will discuss when you should think about bidding 4, but I want to emphasize that, if your partner opens a Weak Two and you have 3-card support, you must at a minimum bid 3 regardless of your point count. Bridge experts call this "furthering the preempt" and it is a very effective tactic.|PG||NT||

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ok, so the next question is, assuming you have 2-card or 3-card support, when should you think about bidding game? Well, let's first think about what partner can have and how many Bergen declarer points that translates to. We know for a fact that partner is promising 5-10 HCP and a 6-card suit. First of all, we can add 2 points for the six card length. So we are up to 7-12 Bergen starting points. Now we also have to take distribution into account.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It might occur to some of you that opener can have a quality suit (or even 2 quality suits when 6-4-2-1).

^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|What about playing 3N? |PG||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, with 2+ card support, it is almost always better to play in a major suit. And with a singleton or void in partner's suit, NT will be difficult unless you have your own source of tricks. |CP|8|at|So, never try to "rescue" partner if you have a singleton or void in their suit.|cp||PG||AT|

There are a few instances where I favor 3N over 4 of a major. And that is when I can count 9 tricks. So, if I have a hand with a doubleton or tripleton honor (A, K, or Q), I might consider 3N when I can count 9 tricks based on the Ogust response. The most obvious example is when I have a doubleton or tripleton honor and 3 Aces. Then, if in response to 2N, partner shows a good suit (2 of the top 3 honors), I can count 9 tricks (six in opener's suit plus 3 aces). Of course, most hands are not that obvious. |PG||AT|

The general rule I use is I "picture" partner having AQxxxx of his suit and nothing else. If I am willing to play 3NT opposite that holding, I would bid Ogust. Similarly, if I am willing to play 3 of our suit with that holding, and 3N if partner has a max, then I also bid Ogust, bidding 3N if partner shows a good hand with a good suit.|PG||AT|

Of course, if I have a maximum opener (18+), I am willing to play game opposite just about any 6 point hand, so I might bid 3N with a balanced hand with 2 card support (or even a singleton if I can count 9 outside tricks). If I have 16 or 17, I would tend to favor 4 of the major over 3N, although if I were willing to play 3 of the major, I might bid Ogust just in case partner shows 8-10 HCP.|PG||NT||

^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|Howard, not all my opponents always are accommodating. For example what should our partnership do if I open 2@H, for example, and the auction goes 2@H-P-2N-3suit-?|PG||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Glad to explain. Many people have devised somewhat complicated systems over doubles (if interested, read about DOPI, DOPE, and DEPO), but I use a simple approach, based on stolen bid doubles. Generally speaking, pass means I would have responded with a bid below whatever the overcall was, double means the opponents "stole" my bid, and otherwise I bid what I would have without interference. There are some slight variations, depending on what is overcalled.|PG||AT|

1) Over 3@D, pass means I would have responded 3@C, double means I would have responded 3@D, and 3@H and 3S mean the same as if there were no interference.|PG||AT|

2) Over 3@H, pass means I would have responded 3@C or 3@D, double means I would have responded 3@H, and 3@S means the same as if there were no interference.|PG||AT|

3) Over 3@S, pass means I would have responded 3@C or 3@D, and double means I would have responded 3@H or 3@S.|PG||AT|

4) Over 3@C, you can just use the normal approach -- double means I would have responded 3@C and 3@D/3@H/3@S mean the same as if there were no interference. Since pass is also available, I play a small wrinkle, but it is certainly optional, and you need not play it. If I pass, that says I would have bid 3@C, but I have some defense and am willing to play 3@C. If I double, that says I opened the usual hondo trash with little defense.|PG||cp|1|AT|

4@H is the best response from the three options of Pass, or 3H, or 4@H. Partner has a good heart suit and not much strength outside of hearts. You probably can take six heart tricks and the @cA. If partner has some length in diamonds, partner can probably ruff one or two diamonds in dummy. Partner should be able to take eight or nine tricks in a heart contract.|PG||NT|^B@2
On the other hand it is quite likely the opponents can make game or more in spades. It's unlikely that partner has much in spades. Therefore, if you are defending 4@S, it's doubtful your side will get any tricks in that suit. If the opponents' hearts divide 2–1, you'll get a heart trick-your partnership has ten hearts. |PG||NT|^B@2
If they divide 3–0, you won't get any heart tricks. You should get a trick with the @cA, but you won't get any more tricks unless partner comes up with something.  |PG||NT|^B@2
You don't expect to go down too badly, even if the opponents double. If they do double, the penalty is likely to be less than the value of the game they can make. They may not even double the 4@H contract, being afraid that you have a stronger hand.|PG||NT|^B@2
If they bid, they may misjudge the situation and get too high. At worst, they'll reach their normal contract of 4@S, and you will have lost nothing.|PG||NT|^B@2 
A tactical underbid of 3@H, hoping the opponents will stop in 3@S, or an immediate jump to 5@H, hoping the opponents will misjudge what to do are worth your consideration.|PG||NT|^B@2
To prove a point, let's see how will partner fare in 4@H doubled if East doubles the 4@H contract, rather than bidding 4@S.|PG||MB|xppp|sk||PG||NT|^B@2
Most likely down one. Partner will lose two spades, one diamond and one club. Partner's other diamond losers can be ruffed in dummy if necessary. Down one doubled is not bad result because East/West have no difficulty making 4@S.|PG||NT|^B@2
You say you are not convinced. Fair enough. Let us randomly divide the remaining 26 cards between East/West and take a look.|PG||ub|4|pg||pf|y|mb|4sppp|PG||md|0,sa65432h9daj75cqj ,0,skqht8dq9864ckt98 |SB|EI have a random hand.|PG||SB|WThey gave me a random hand too. Not a bad hand since you pushed us to 4S :).|PG||NT|^B@2
You have at most one heart trick, a club trick for sure and maybe a trick with partner's @dK. Therefore East–West should make their 4@S contract with ease.|SB|E|SB|W|PG||NT|^B@2
The jump to 4@H makes the auction much more difficult for East–West to judge exactly what to do. If East bids 4S, rather than doubling, West might decide to bid more. If the opponents get to the five level, they could go down. Such is the nature of preemptive bids. It makes the game of bridge quite exciting, and the results can be unpredictable.|PG||NT|^B@2
Would it make any difference if West had doubled 2@H, with a different hand than the random we just gave him, instead of over­calling 2@S?|PG||AT| No. North should jump to 4@H, hoping the opponents will guess incorrectly about what to do.|PG||NT|^B@2
BTW, the deal is set for a double dummy play. Go ahead and try it with any lead and as often as you wish as long as you do not click the forward arrow. refer to the|CP|8|AT| HELP |CP||AT|section if you need assistance in playing double dummy.|PG||NT||pf||

North has a number of options—2NT/3@C/3@H/4@H. North can simply raise to 3@H and give up on the possibility of game. North can jump to 4@H and hope the partnership can make game or that any penalty for being defeated is less than the value of the opponents' contract. Or North can take a more middle-of-the road approach and bid 2NT, asking for a further description of partner's hand.|MB|2N|AN|Asking for feature|PG||MB|P|sk||lb|*bIf North does bid 2NT, what will South say?^^3D|NT|^B@2
With a maximum, South will show a diamond feature.|MB|3D|PG||NT|^B@2
This will probably encourage North to take the partnership to game. If South had shown a minimum, North would settle for 3@H. The partnership also might get to game if North were to bid 3@C, forcing, over the 2@S overcall. South doesn't have support for clubs, but with a maximum hand can bid 3D, showing a feature.

After North's pass, East has a perfect hand for a Weak Two Bid. The opening bid of 2@H shows a good six-card suit and not enough values for an opening bid at the one level.|PG||nt||sk|S|lb|*bWhat should be the bid by South?^^p|NT|^B@2
South's hand is not suitable for either an overcall or a takeout double.|MB|p|pg||nt||sk|w|lb|*bWhat should West bid?^^p|NT|^B@2
West doesn't care much for partner's choice of trump suit but should not attempt to “improve” the contract.|PG||mb|P|at| West's hand is unsuitable for notrump, and a response in a new suit would be forcing, likely getting the partnership too high.

North has the values for a balancing bid, but neither a takeout double nor an overcall is attractive. North passes, leaving East as declarer in 2@H.|pg||MB|PPP|sk||NT|^B@2 
North–South. however, can make at least eight tricks in diamonds, and even a contract of 3@D down one would be a good result.

Declarer has a spade loser, a heart loser, two diamond losers and two club losers. East should plan to draw trumps and then try finesses in both diamonds and clubs. East can lead twice toward dummy's @cK and @cQ, hoping that South has the @cA.|PG||NT|^B@2
East also can lead a low diamond from dummy toward the @dK, hoping North has the DA. There's not much difficulty on the actual deal, since both the @CA and the @DA are favorably placed for declarer.

On the layout of the cards, there's nothing the defenders can do to prevent East from making a contract of 2@H. The best they can do is get a club ruff and prevent declarer from making an overtrick. This isn't easy. |PG||NT|^B@2
With the spade sequence to lead from, South is unlikely to start by leading the @CA, hoping to get a ruff. On the lead of the @SJ, North will win the first trick with the @sA but is unlikely to lead back a club. unless one of the defenders switches to clubs before East can drive out the @HA and draw trumps, declarer will take nine tricks. |PG||NT|^B@2
If North–South find a way into the auction and play in a diamond part score, East–West can probably take five tricks after the lead of the @HJ — one spade, two hearts, one diamond and one club. |PG||NT|^B@2
If South plays in a notrump contract and West leads the @hJ, East must be careful to overtake this with the @hQ and continue leading hearts. If East doesn't overtake and South holds up the @hA, East–West won't be able to establish their heart winners while East still has a potential entry with the @dK.|PG||NT||

With a balanced hand, 15 high-card points and an honor in partner's suit, North has interest in reaching a game contract after hearing South's opening bid of 2@D. |PG||NT|^B@2
Without any strength in hearts, it would be dangerous for North to insist on a contract of 3NT, especially since South could have as few as 6 points. Instead, North asks for more information by making the artificial response of 2NT--asking for Feature.|PG||mb|2n|pg||mb|p|NT||sk|s|lb|*bChoose your bid.^^3h|NT|^B@2

Although South has shown some values in hearts, that suit still looks best for the defense. Presumably, North has some strength in clubs and spades for the 3NT bid. East would start with the @HQ, top of a broken sequence. |PG||pc|hq|sk|n|NT|^B@2
Declarer has two sure winners in spades and three in diamonds. If the missing diamonds divide 3–2 or the @DJ appears on the first round, declarer will get three more tricks from that suit. Declarer can promote a ninth trick in clubs and may get a trick from the heart suit. |PG||lb|*CWhich card should not be played from Dummy?^^h4^s83 hK 5 4 c6 5dA Qt8 7 3|NT|^B@2
North has one hurdle to overcome, the opening heart lead. North wants to make sure that the defenders don't take four or five heart tricks and defeat the contract. There's no danger if East holds the @HA, since the @HK will then be a trick. There is a danger if West holds the @HA. To decide whether to play the @HK on the first trick, North needs to look carefully at the layout of the suit. |PG||lb|*mWho holds the HA?^West~East^1|NT|^B@2
East's lead of the @HQ implies that East also holds the @HJ. East could be leading from a holding such as @HA Q J x or @HQ J 9 x. Therefore West must hold the @HA.|PG||NT|^B@2
The @H10 in North's hand is a critical card. As long as East holds the @HJ, North can secure the contract by playing low on the first trick. East's @HQ may win the first trick, but now the defenders are helpless.|PC|h4h8h2|PG||NT|^B@2
If East continues with the @HJ, |PC|hj|at| declarer can cover with dummy's @HK.|PC|HK|PG||AT| Then @H10 will become a trick if West wins the @HA.|hc|HT|PC|HAH6|PG||NT|^B@2
If East continues with a low heart,|UP|4|pg||PC|h7|PG||AT| declarer plays low from dummy |PC|H5|PG||AT| and will win the trick with the @H10, unless West plays the @HA.|PG||NT|^B@2
If West does play the @HA on the second trick,|PC|HAh6|PG||AT| South's @HK is a winner.|sk||PG||NT|^B@2
By playing a low heart from dummy on the first trick, declarer effectively freezes the suit. If the defenders lead the suit a second time, declarer is sure to get a heart trick. If the defenders lead anything else, declarer can establish a club trick to make the contract. There are many such positions where the suit is frozen for one side or the other or both. Whichever side leads the suit will lose a trick.|PG||NT|^B@2
Look at what happens if declarer plays the @HK on the first trick,|UP|7|PG||AT| hoping East has the @HA.|PC|HK|PG||AT| West wins and returns a heart,|PC|HAh2|PG||PC|H8|PG||AT| trapping North's @H10. The defenders take the first five heart tricks and the @CA to defeat the contract two tricks.|PG||NT|^B@2
If declarer negotiates the heart suit correctly, the only remaining challenge is the diamond suit. When the defenders' diamonds divide 3–2, six tricks roll home in the suit, and declarer makes the contract.|PG||NT||cp|1|AT|

As you noticed. if East starts with the @HQ, the defenders can defeat the contract, if dummy's @HK is played on the first trick. If declarer plays a low heart from dummy on the first trick, there's nothing the defenders can do. If the @HQ wins the first trick, East's best continuation is the @HJ, hoping that West holds the @H10 or that North started with a doubleton @H10. |PG||NT|^B@2
Interestingly enough, if declarer does duck the first heart, West's best play is to overtake with the @HA and return a heart. That gives declarer a trick with the @HK, but establishes the heart suit for the defense. |PG||NT|^B@2
Declarer can't afford to let East win a trick with the @CA and is restricted to nine tricks. If West doesn't overtake the first heart and East continues with a small heart, declarer most likely will make ten tricks — getting a heart trick and having time to establish a club trick. |PG||NT|^B@2
It's interesting to speculate what might happen if East leads a low heart rather than the @HQ. Declarer should play low from dummy and not risk everything by playing the @HK on the first trick. Then declarer will make the contract. If declarer plays the @HK on the first trick, the defenders can defeat the contract two tricks.|PG||NT||

Now it's up to North. Although partner has been doubled at the two level, the double wasn't for penalties. If North passes, East–West will probably bid to their best contract. With three-card support for partner's suit, North should raise to the three level. |PG||NT|^B@2
North–South should have a nine-card fit, making it difficult for the opponents to double for penalty, and the raise will make it awkward for East–West to find their best spot.|PG||sk|e|NT|^B@2
Had North passed, East would be able to comfortably respond 3@H to the takeout double, and East–West would end up in their best contract. |PG||NT|^B@2
After the 3@S bid, East has a tough decision. East has some high cards, but not really enough to bid 4H and not enough to double 3S. East's best choice is probably to pass and hope to defeat the contract. If East passes, that should end the auction. West doesn't have enough to compete any further.|PG||mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|sk|w|lb|*CWhich should the opening lead for West ?^^ha^S9HA QT5C K J 9 5DAT7 3|NT|^B@2
West has a difficult choice of opening leads. Anything could be right. It's usually best to avoid leading a singleton trump when there's no expectation that declarer will be ruffing losers in dummy. Instead, West should pick an unbid suit. |PG||NT|^B@2
The @HA is quite reasonable. South has shown a weak hand and is unlikely to hold the @HK. West will have a better idea of what to do next after seeing the dummy.|PG||pc|ha|sk|s|NT|^B@2
South has a potential spade loser, a heart loser, two diamond losers and two club losers.|PG||AT| A diamond loser can be ruffed in dummy or the @D10 might drop, so declarer's main concern should be the trump suit.|PG||NT|^B@2
Declarer has a choice between playing the @SA and @SK, hoping the @SQ will fall, or taking a finesse. The standard guideline in this situation is the old adage, eight ever, nine never, indicating that with nine or more cards, you never finesse. |PG||NT|^B@2
This is a guideline, however, not a rule. Declarer also should be guided by the auction. West's takeout double showing support for all of the unbid suits indicates that West is probably short in spades. Declarer should take this into account before deciding what to do in spades.|PG||NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2
Paul Thurston|CP||AT| recently said, "Old adages are good for sewing on cushions or wall hangings. 8 ever, 9 never isn't wrong - just have to be careful about when to apply it.'|PG||NT|^B@2
Suppose the defenders lead the @HA |
PC|h4h2h6|PG||at|  and another heart,|PC|h5|PC|h7|PC|h3|pg||AT| which is ruffed by South.|PC|s3|PG||AT| Before playing any trumps, declarer should lead diamonds next to drive out the @DA.|PC|D4|PC|da|pc|d9|pc|d2|PG||AT| This will allow declarer to ruff a diamond loser even if the missing trumps divide badly.|PG||AT| Suppose the defenders take their clubs and declarer regains the lead. |
PC|ckc3c6c2|PG||
PC|c5cqcac7|PG||
PC|cts4c9c4|pg||NT|^B@2
Now it's time for the trump suit. Declarer plays a low spade to dummy's @SK,|PC|s7s9sks5|PG||AT| and leads a low spade back toward |PC|s6|PG||AT| the South hand. East follows on the second round with a low spade,|PC|S8|PG||AT| and South is at the crossroads. Follow the guideline or take the finesse based on the inference from the auction?|PG||sk||NT|^B@2
As can be seen from the actual layout, South can make the contract by finessing. Is that the right play? In this situation, there is no right or wrong. That's what makes the game interesting. Going down one trick in a contract of 3S is no disaster. Making 3S will be an excellent result. South still may be pondering.|PG||up|30|NT|^B@2  
On the other hand, the defenders should avoid giving declarer any help. If the defenders lead spades, they will solve declarer's problem in that suit.|PG||AT| Meanwhile, they should be careful to collect the tricks to which they are entitled — one heart, one diamond and two clubs. Then they'll have to sit back and see if declarer gives them a second diamond trick or a spade trick. |PG||NT|^B@2
If East–West bid to a heart contract, they are unlikely to take 10 tricks, even if they guess how to play the club suit. North–South should get at least one spade trick, one heart trick and two diamond tricks, maybe more. |PG||NT|^B@2
If East– West get pushed to 4@H, they are likely to get a poor result if they go down two tricks (or get doubled and go down one trick). Vulnerable undertricks can be expensive.|PG||NT||bt||

^B@2^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|Martysseus Our Lord, favorite of Gods, and wisest of all Kings. Kiamemnon our legendary King was sent to Hades by his wife's lover. But, before his departure he spoke of your wisdom and great teachings in ^*ISecrets To Winning Bridge^*N pamphlets. His final wish was that Pegasus, the white winged horse, be sent to the Temple of Apollo to seek your permission for Pamphlet ##5 on “Mastering Weak-2 Bids” to be placed in the space beyond . . . known as the Internet.  You kindly sent back to him these words, “Yes.  Thank you.  Help yourself.” Thus, we turn to your written words to lead us through the treacherous waters between Scylla and Charybdis to reach Isle of Weak-Two Bids.|PG||cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|As a cherry picker, I will focus on your most perspicacious pronouncements in that particular pamphlet and bring to earthy light those of pure “Martysseus” for which you are most famous. To begin, I ask you, “What criteria do you use to deem a hand too strong for a preemptive Weak Two?"|PG||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMartysseus: ^*N|cp||at|If a hand meets Rule of 20 it is too strong to open Weak Two. With 10 HCP it is okay to open a Weak Two (but if 6-4, open 1 of a suit). Most hands with 11 HCP are too strong for a preempt. I have a list ( suit texture, vulnerability status, LOTT and my position at the table) that quickly run in my head each time before preempting. Kiamemnon has told you many of those requirements. However, let me emphasize one very important point. The best time to preempt is when your side is not vulnerable; and the Opponent are vulnerable. The most dangerous time to preempt is when your side is vulnerable and  the Opponent are not.|PG||cp|1|AT|

Many of the examples used for the quizzes are the ones you already have seen in the tutorial. A few are from my sources and the rest are my own creation—including some spicy ones. You may not agree with some of the answers which is to be expected. The Movie Maker has learned one very important point in bridge which is the experts hardly agree on anything. However, I have grabbed tight and held firm the Proteus of Bridge to assist me in assuring safe and correct answers.|PG||AT|   

Please note that this is a long section and several quizzes are not really related to Weak Two bids—just to make sure you are awake. Further, a few quizzes have nothing to do with bridge at all. So take the good, the bad, and the interesting. Now please click the forward arrow to begin.

%%%%%%%%%%%% FROG JUMPING
ht|c|lb|*mDo you know who made "Frog Jumping" famous in the US?^NFL~ACBL~Mark Twain~CBS~Donald Trump~??^3|
ht|b|at|"Frog jumping is a competitive pastime in which frogs compete to jump certain distances. Frog jumping contests are held in small communities scattered around the United States, as part of the folk culture. Frog jumping was made famous in a short story by Mark Twain, "^*IThe Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County^*N." To read the short story please click this link. |CP|1|AT|^*Hetext.virginia.edu/railton/projects/price/frog.htm^*N|CP||PG||AT|

"An event has been held annually in Calaveras County since 1928, with other events held in Indiana, Ohio, Washington, Maine, Missouri, Louisiana, New York, and also in Manitoba, Canada. With 4,000 contestants in 2007, the Calaveras County contest has strict rules regulating the frogs' welfare, including limiting the daily number of a frog's jumps, and mandating the playing of calming music in their enclosures. The endangered California Red-legged Frog may not be entered in the competition. Participants entering the longest jumping frog were to win a $750 prize or $5,000 if their frog breaks the 1986 record of |CP|8|AT|21 feet, 5¾ inches|CP||AT| set by Rosie the Ribeter."|PG||cp|1|AT|

^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|The above information is from |CP|1|AT|^*Hen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frog_jumping_contest^*N|CP||AT|. The most popular yearly contest is held in Angels Camp, California. Check more on the town and the contest from |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.angelscamp.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=32:frog-hop-of-fame&catid=11:the-community&Itemid=15^*N|CP||pg||AT|

The record frog jump for 2011 is 20' 4" which was set by frog named "It's Cheaper to Leap Her" from Carmichael, California. The jockey was Kevin Daly.|PG||AT|

It is possible that "Frog Jumping" could be more fun than playing bridge. My personal favorite site is |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.wackyowl.com/frog-jumping-contest-festival/^*N|CP||AT|. The pictures are priceless. They are not too far off from the scenes in a bridge club!|PG||cp|1|AT|

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from the hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to that you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-
