Larry Cohen says, "It continually amazes me how many "intermediate" players have been improperly taught (or improperly remember) this topic."
Opener's Strong Jump Shift is defined as a single jump bid in a rank higher than both responder's and opener's initial suit rank, promising 19-21 distribution points. It is forcing to game except 2N jump shift. Let us look at a few - Examples.|

The 2@S, 3@C, and 3@D are jump shifts showing 19-21 points and are game forcing.|

You open with 1@H. The hand is worht 21 Starting Points—there are 18 high-card points, plus 1 point for a 5-card suits, plus 2 for the quality heart and diamond suits. The hand isn't quite strong enough to open with 2@C. With a choice of 5-card suits, open the higher-ranking—1@H. North, responds 1@S.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


NT||lb|*bWhat should South bid?^^3d|NT|^B@2
Responder has at least 6 and could have a more. Since you have 21, the partnership has 27 or more combined points. You belong at the game level or higher. That's why you want to make a forcing bid at this point. You don't want responder to pass and leave the partnership in partscore. Partner can and may pass 2@D and 3@H. |
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This is the standard situation for a jump shift. You show a maximum-strength hand by jumping in the second suit—a jump and a shift of suits. It is Descriptive and forcing. You want to tell responder about the second suit and see which suit responder prefers. You also want to let partner know you have a maximum-strength hand of 19 to 21 points. That will help partner decide whether the partnership belongs in game or slam. Finally, you want to make a forcing bid.|MB|3D|

This hand is not strong enough for a jump shift. You have 18 Starting Points (17 HCP plus 1 for the 5-card suit). Partner could have as few as 6. 24 combined points are probably not enough for game. You should rebid 2@D. If partner can't bid again, you are unlikely to miss a game contract. |
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On the other hand, if partner passes 2@D, then partner prefers diamonds to hearts and will have only one or two hearts. Game is unlikely. If partner bids over 2@D, you will get an opportunity to show your extra strength.|mb|2d|

The HCP strength hasn't changed, but you have 3-card support. This hand is worth a jump shift to 3@D. You plan to show spade support next. The hand is worth 22 Starting Point—17 HCP plus 3 dummy points for the singleton. You don't want to jump to 4@S with only three-card support. Responder could have only four spades. By jump shifting and then supporting spades, you show the strength of the hand without promising 4-card support for partner's suit.|MB|3D|
