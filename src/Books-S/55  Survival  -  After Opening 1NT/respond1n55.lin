As responder after a 1N opener, hands fall into one of 3 categories--|CP|8|FP|2|AT|MINIMUM, MEDIUM,|cp||at| or |cp|8|at|MAXIMUM. |FP||CP||AT|The point ranges are slightly different than the ranges we discussed earlier. The point ranges are:|

CP|8|FP|2|AT|

  ^cMinimum |FP||CP||AT|^f- no more than 7 points; game is not possible;|CP|8|FP|2|AT|
  ^CMedium |FP||CP||AT|^f- 8-9 points; game is possible if opener has a maximum NT (defined below);|CP|8|FP|2|AT|
  ^CMaximum |FP||CP||AT|^f- 10 or more points; you must bid game.|

Strong NT hands also fall into one of 2 categories |CP|8|FP|2|AT|MAXIMUM|cp||at| or |CP|8|FP|2|AT| MINIMUM|FP||CP||AT|.
A NT hand is considered a MAXIMUM if it meets any of the following criteria:|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


AT|

^C* Any hand with 17 HCP
^C* Any hand with 16 HCP and a fit with responder's major suit
^C* Any hand with 16 HCP and a 5-card suit
^C* Any hand with 16 HCP, not 4-3-3-3 distribution, and at least two 10s or 9s.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |

A NT hand is considered a MINIMUM if it does not meet any of the above criteria.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Partner opens 1N and you have the hand as is shown above. Again, with an invitational hand, the correct way to bid the hand with 5/5 in majors is first transfer to spades by bidding 2@H. This hand is stronger than it looks. You are assured to find a fit either in spades or hearts. Therefore, it is worth 10 Dummy Points--5 HCP, 2 for length points, 2 for singleton, and 1 for one doubleton. It is also rich in intermediates.|mb|2H|
