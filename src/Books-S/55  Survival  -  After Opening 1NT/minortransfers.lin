{  Simple Transfer to Minors  }

|fp||CP||CS||at|The transfer to minors can be used for two purposes:|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|

a) to allow responder to bid 3NT with a 6-8 point hand and a 6-card minor suit.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|
  
b) to play in three of a minor with five or fewer points and a 6-card minor.

AT|^B@2^Y@3
Most partnerships play Jacoby Transfers for major suits. However, interested players may use Jacoby Transfers for the minors as well. First, let me explain the benefits of transfers in minors.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


AT|

In general, if you have a weak hand with a long suit opposite a strong hand, it is more desirable to play in the weak hand's suit because in that suit, the long cards will take tricks, whereas in another suit it may not be possible to score the low cards in the weak hand's long suit. The only tradeoff is you have to play at the three level, which is kind of high. However, given a weak hand with seven clubs or diamonds, the tradeoff is worth it.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


AT|

Some partnerships play 2@S as a transfer to minors. Opener automatically responds 3@C. The partner bidding the transfer passes with clubs or corrects to 3@D. That is easier to play, but not quite as flexible. I recommend you start with this simpler transfer and then progress to the stronger and more flexible version which I will explain next. Let me first show you a few examples of the simple transfer to minors.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT|

BTW, all "transfer bids" should be alerted. Further both "accepted" and "rejected" response bids by the NT opener should be alerted as these are additional informations available to the partnership that opponents should be aware of. To economize his time, the Movie Maker has not included the alerts in the following examples. Please consider it done in every situation. In all example you are using 2@S to transfer to minor(S).|

^-|fp||CP||CS||AT|^B@2
One variant of Jacoby that I use is 4-suit Jacoby transfer. A 2@S bid by responder is a transfer to clubs, and a 2NT bid is a transfer to diamonds. Since there are two bids between the transfer bid and the transfer suit, opener now has two choices. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


AT|

With good support (ONLY if you have 1 of the top 3 honors, regardless of the length of your support), opener "accepts" the transfer by not bidding the suit (1NT-2@S-2NT or 1NT-2NT-3@C). BTW, Notrumper alwyas has at least 2-card minor.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


AT| 
With less than good support, opener "rejects" the transfer by bidding the transfer suit (1NT-2@S-3@C or 1NT-2NT-3@D). |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


AT|

This is somewhat counter-intuitive, as one would think the more natural way would be for opener to bid the suit to "accept" the transfer. However, the reason for doing it this way is that it is more likely that opener will end up as declarer.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


AT|

Again, this convention can be used for two purposes:
1. To allow responder to bid 3NT with a 6-8 point hand and a 6-card minor suit if opener accepts the transfer. Otherwise, the contract will be 3 of the minor.

2. To play in 3 of a minor with 5 or fewer points and a 6-card minor.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


AT|

As an important clarification. If you play 4-suit Jacoby transfer you cannot make a 2NT invitational bid. In another word, 1N-P-2N is not invitational bid. In its place you bid Stayman followed by 2NT. Now we have to 1NT bidder should be alert to the following:
^C1NT-2@C-2@S-2NT does not necessarily promise hearts and simply shows a 2N invite.
^C1NT-2@C-2@H-2N denies 4 spades by responder and simply shows a 2N invite. 
^B@2If responder bids Stayman with an invitational hand and 4 spades, he must bid 2@S when opener responds 2@H (e.g. the auction should go 1N-2@C-2@H-2@S).|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |

^B@2Let us look at a few examples illustrating 4-suit jacoby transfer. Your partnership is playing 4-way Jacoby transfer.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This version of Transfer to Minors is very powerful but can be confusing because the traditional invitational 2NT bid by responder no longer is available. To make an invitational raise to 2N (since a direct 2N is a diamond transfer), you bid Stayman first and then 2N. Therefore, if responder bids Stayman, on rare occasions she will not have  a 4-card major. You should have a thorough discussion with your partner if you would like to use this version of transfer to minors.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One major benefit of this version is that the partnership  can use it to bid thin 3N games. For example, suppose your partner opens 1N and you have AQxxxx of diamonds. You might transfer to diamonds, and if partner bids 3@C which shows 3 to the K, you bid 3N since you likely have 6 diamond tricks. |

{  Should You Transfer to Minors?  }

^-|HT|c|cp||FP||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|That has been my question and finally I received the following answer from Howard.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


AT|

As a general rule, it is usually much harder to take nine tricks than seven tricks. And three of a minor requires that you take nine tricks whereas 1N requires you only have to take seven tricks. Therefore, unless you are pretty sure you are going to take three more tricks in a minor-suit contract than in NT, you should not transfer. (If you take two more tricks in a minor-suit contract, you break even.) So, how do you know if a minor-suit contract will yield three more tricks? |
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


AT|

Well, you don't. But here are some guidelines that work pretty well. If you have a 7-card minor and a weak hand, transfer. If you have a 6-card minor and shortness somewhere (a singleton or void) and a weak hand, transfer. Otherwise, don't bother.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


AT| 

By the way, this is essentially the same logic as to why you strongly prefer to play 3N as opposed to 5 of a minor. It is much easier to take nine tricks than eleven.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) opened the BIL on  September 3, 2003 to provide the learner bridge player with a secluded place to attend lessons , mentoring sessions  and hosted practice sessions free from interruptions by the advanced bridge player.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions  and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.
