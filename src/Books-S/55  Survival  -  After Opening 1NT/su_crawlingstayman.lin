cp||at|This short tutorial briefly explains Crawling Stayman. You can use Standard Stayman only when you have at least one four card major and more than 7 points. However, responder to a 1N opener may have hands with 7 or less points with certain required distribution. Experts endlessly modify those requirements and name them Garbage Stayman, Crawling Stayman, Junk Stayman, to name a few. Here we look at the Crawling Stayman. Let us look at a few examples. In all the responder's hand is weak@-7 points or less and 4-4 in majors.|

cp||at|Even with weak 5-5-2-1 you can bid 2@c (Crawling Stayman) and over a 2@d response bid 2@h and follow as above. If you don't want to bother to play Crawling Stayman, then simply transfer to your better major, and pass when opener accepts the transfer. This works out fine usually. BTW, 5-2 fit plays better than the 4-4 fit. And a 5-3 fit almost always plays better than a 4-4 fit.|

cp||at|One is that it shows 5/5 with an invitational hand, giving opener a choice of playing 3@h, 3@s, 4@h, or 4@s. But 5/5 invitational hands are rare, so I think it is better to play that as a 5/5 slam try. |
