^-{    The Stayman Convention    }
|FP||cp||AT|The Stayman Convention is used to find a 4-4 major suit fit in NT auctions.|

You should only use Stayman if you have a |FP|2|CP|8|at|medium (8-9)|FP||CP||AT| or |FP|2|CP|8|at|maximum (10 or more)|FP||CP||AT| hand.
Do not bid Stayman if you have a |CP|8|AT|minimum (0 to 7 points)|CP||AT| hand. 
You should bid Stayman if you have a medium or maximum hand and your hand meets any of the following criteria:|

^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||fp|2|at|If opener bids 2D and responder has a 5-card major, responder should bid it (e.g., 1NT-2C-2D-2S). Opener then has the following options: 
a) With 15 points, opener does not have enough to accept responder's invitation and should pass. If opener has 3-card support to an honor, he can raise to 3, giving responder one last chance to bid a thin game. 
b) With 16 points and 2-card support, opener will often pass. However, if opener has a 16-point maximum NT bid (as described earlier), he can bid 3NT. 
c) With 17 points and 2-card support, opener should accept responder's invitation and bid 3NT. 
d) With 17 points and 3-card support, opener should bid game in the major. |

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) opened the BIL on  September 3, 2003 to provide the learner bridge player with a secluded place to attend lessons , mentoring sessions  and hosted practice sessions free from interruptions by the advanced bridge player.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions  and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.
