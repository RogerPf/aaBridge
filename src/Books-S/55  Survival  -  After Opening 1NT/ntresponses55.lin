^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The Stayman Convention is used to find a 4-4 major suit fit in NT auctions. You should only use Stayman if you have an invitational (8-9) or a game forcing hand (10 or more). Do not bid Stayman if you have a minimum (0 to 7 points) hand. Further, your hand should meet any of the following criteria:|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


cs|1|cp|4|AT|

{  You have one 4-card major  }|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


AT|

{  You have two 4-card majors  }|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


AT|

{  You have one 4-card major and one 5-card major   }

|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


cp||AT|
Therefore, with a game forcing and an invitational hand you bid Stayman if you have 5/4 in majors when responding to 1NT opener by partner. In a separate section other variations of Stayman is discussed.|

However, responder to a 1N opener may have hands less than 7 points with certain distribution which have made experts endlessly modify those requirements. There is a name for each modification. Garbage Stayman, Crawling Stayman, Junk Stayman, to name a few. Here we like to lump most of them under a new heading - other Staymans. Let us look at a few examples.

^*BMM: ^*NHoward uses Crawling Stayman with equal length in the majors (any weak 5/5 and 4-4 with 0-3 HCP). For now, let us look at a 4=4=2=3 or 4=4=3=2 distribution first.|

Partner open 1N, RHO pass, and you have this weak 4=4=2=3 hand. Garbage Stayman cannot help you. Here Crawling Stayman is a good CRAWL -:).|

PG| ***** 114 ***** |


AT| Your 2@H bid is asking opener to pass with better hearts than spades or bid 2@S with better spades than hearts. Notrumper cannot have doubletons in both majors.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even with weak 5=5=2=1 you can bid 2@C (Crawling Stayman) and over a 2@D response bid 2@H and follow as above. If you don't want to bother to play Crawling Stayman, then simply transfer to your better major, and pass when opener accepts the transfer. This works out fine usually. BTW, 5-2 fit plays better than the 4-4 fit. And a 5-3 fit almost always plays better than a 4-4 fit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, if you play Crawling Stayman, the question then is what does 1N-2@H-2@S-3@H show?|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


AT| There are 2 choices.|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One is that it shows 5/5 with an invitational hand, giving opener a choice of playing 3@H, 3@S, 4@H, or 4@S. But 5/5 invitational hands are rare, so I think it is better to play that as a 5/5 slam try. |
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Opener bids 3@S if he or she prefers 3@S. Otherwise they make a control bid, which accepts hearts as trump. |
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That means that if it goes 1N-2@H-2@S-3@H-4@C, opener is showing a club control, confirming hearts as trump, but not denying a spade control (3@S would confirm spades as trump and is therefore not available as a control bid.)|
