Your partnership plays Jacoby Transfers. You open 1N (15-17 HCP - balanced hand) and after a pass by LHO, partner bids either 2@D or 2@H. You have to obey the demand and bid 2@H or 2@S respectively.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|

What if you have a ^*BSuper^*N 1N opener hand with 4 or even 5 hearts or spades when partner bids either 2@D or 2@H. Your response tells partner that you have 2+ cards in that major, therefore, with a so so hand will pass. Could you have missed game or even slam if? Or, on the flip side, what if responder has a hand such as you will see next. Could you miss game or even slam if responder does not know much more than Jacoby transfer indicates? Let us look at that hand and see.|

You are assured of a 9-card fit. You can upgrade your hand, using Bergen's hand evaluation, to 11 points - 8 Starting Points and 3 for singleton spades when you have 4+ trumps. So with 11 points you can safely bid game opposite a notrump opening.|

Further, according to Bergen's hand evaluation the hand now is upgraded to 18 Dummy Points. Yes the actual Declarer has shorter trump suit (4-card but could have 5) and evaluates his hand as being the Dummy. So his Bergen Dummy Points are: 15 HCPs + 1 point for a doubleton (because he is using Dummy points) + 1 point for diamond Quality suit + 1 point for 5 Aces/Tens and no quacks = 18.|

Super-Accepting in its simplest and easiest to remember form is:
When you open 1NT with a 4+ card in one of the majors,
partner transfers to that major, and finally
you have an exemplary or beautiful 1NT hand. ^*N|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


AT|

So, playing standard Super-Accept, you bid 3@H when partner is transferring to hearts (he bids 2@D). Or you bid 3@S after a 2@H transfer to spades. With those information your partner re-evaluates his hand and makes the appropriate bid--pass, bid game or etc. What we really need to learn is what makes a 1NT hand ^*IExemplary, or Beautiful or Super^*N.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


AT|

Howard our teacher and mentor, has the following simple guideline. 

"After a strong 1N opening 15/17, I always play Super-Accept with four-card support unless I have the ^*Bflattest 15 point NT^*N opening. Marty Bergen is a strong proponent of this method. It is based on the Law of Total Tricks, as you can bid to three level with nine card fit. However, many experts play the more restrictive Super-Accepts-4 trumps and 16/17 points Notrump. That is something that partnerships should discuss and agree on."|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


at|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NWithout any question then, having 4+ card in the transferred suit is a must for considering a Super-Accept. However, the qualities which make a Notrump hand exemplary and worthy for a Super-Accept are the source of many debates and the base for many modifications.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


AT|

According to Howard, the ^*Bflattest 15 HCP NT^*N hand cannot be exemplary enough for a Super-Accept. That is really all we need to play standard Super-Accept and have good results more often than not. However, Movie Maker would be out of his day job if you do not insist on knowing all about the controversies and the modifications.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |

Most probably consider Marty Bergen the father of Super-Accept. To bring you his version in the next panel we used the following two sources which you can refer to for your in-depth study. We believe it will construct a base for your understanding even if you decide to play the simple standard Super-Accept.

"MARTY BERGEN'S SECRETS TO WINNING BRIDGE NUMBER 13 - WHAT YOU MUST KNOW ABOUT TRANSFERS"
and 
"BETTER BIDDING WITH BERGEN VOLUME ONE - UNCONTESTED AUCTIONS" under  "Advanced Jacoby - Fit Bids After Notrump Openings."|

{    Super-Accept by Marty Bergen    }  
^-|cp||fp||CS||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|In Standard, notrumper jumps to 3 of the major to Super-Accept--3@H or 3@S. However, when I Super-Accept, I try to give partner extra information. Every time we transfer to a major after a 1NT opening, if opener merely completes the transfer at the two-level, we can be sure the notrumper lacks four trumps. Not only can this prove vital to responder in deciding whether to try for game, but it can also be critical in evaluating slam possibilities. Next is the schedule of rebids for opener after 1NT-P-2@H-?.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


AT|

2@S ^c= two or three spades, any strength hand
2NT ^C= four spades, 4-3-3-3, maximum 1NT hand
3@C ^C= four or more spades, doubleton club, maximum 1NT hand
3@D ^C= four or more spades, doubleton diamond, maximum 1NT hand
3@H ^C= four or more spades, doubleton heart, maximum 1NT hand 
3@S ^C= four or more spades, non-maximum.

Obviously, the same principles apply after 1NT-P-2@D. In this sequence, after a Super-Accept, 3@D "re-transfers" to 3@H. Now, responder can pass, raise to 4@H, or try for slam.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


AT|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NMany experts on the other hand while fully agree with the concept, do not see any good reason for giving partner and of course the opponents the additional information which Marty Bergen refers to. They are content to jump to the three of transferred suit, with a suitable Notrump hand, as a Super-Accept. We will bring some of those arguments after looking at more examples. In the following examples the bidding sequence is 1N-P-2@H-P which is a transfer to spades. The notrumper responses are based on Bergen's style. We also tell you what would be the bid using Howard's simple style--the standard. You only see notrumper's hand. however, South bids Jacoby transfer. Just consider South has 5+ cards in the transferred suit. The strength is irrelevant.|

Notrumper has a maximum flat 1N opener. Responder should base his next bid accordingly. Most likely South will bid 3@H to assure that the strong hand plays either a partscore or game in spades. Opener would bid 3@S if he was playing Super-Accept Howard's style.|

^-|cp||fp||CS||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Here is my simple version:

1) If you open 1NT, and partner bids a 2@D/2@H Jacoby transfer, always jump to 3@H/3@S with 4-card support regardless of HCP.

2) If you open 2NT (or rebid 2NT after a 2@C opener), and partner bids a 3@D/3@H Jacoby transfer, jump to 4@H/4@S with 4-card support.

Marty Bergen has a more complicated set of rules, but he essentially agrees with the above. 

As long as we are on the subject of transfers, here is some bonus material for you. When partner's transfer bid is doubled (lead directing), the NT bidder's responses are as follows:

1) With 2-card support pass. The transfer bidder can then redouble to re-transfer, or make any other appropriate bid (usually 2NT or 3NT).

2) With 3-card support, immediately accept the transfer (e.g.. bid 2@H/2@S over the 2@D/2@H transfer).

3) With 4-card support, Super-Accept.|

Super-Accepts can help him bid a slam when he has something like: @SJxxxxx, @hx, @Dxxx, @CAKx. Without a Super-Accept, he will fear going past 4 of a major with such weak spades.|

After 2NT--transfer, I use 3NT by opener as the only Super-Accept. Super-Accepting to 4 of a major consumes all the room to explore slam below game. Good luck with your bridge!|

We don't always jump with four trumps, since the jump is now to the four level. However, if we do have a super maximum we can pre-accept with a doubleton in case this will be of value for slam exploration. Therefore, with the hand as is shown above, opener should bid 3@h.|

"Usually after a 1 No Trump opener and a Jacoby Transfer, partner will dutifully accept the transfer by bidding the indicated major at the 2 level. From there the bidding proceeds in three directions. Responder either passes, invites or bids game. |
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


at|

"Almost equally familiar is the concept of "Super Acceptance". If you asked 100 people in a 25 table game about Super-Acceptance, 99% would say raise to the three level if you have a maximum and 4 trump and the other guy would be looking for a partner.|

"Since Better Bidding by Bergen was published 24 years ago, there are many players in the game today who have never even seen the book, much less read it. Marty may not have been the father of "Super-Acceptance", but he was one of the first to write about it. |
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


AT|

"In a recent e-mail to me Marty reiterated his position: Jump to the 3 level in the major if you have a "bad" opening 1NT hand, bid 2NT with 4333 and a "max" and bid any doubleton you hold if you have a "nice" hand and 4432.|
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


AT|

"Notice Marty did not seek to define the term "bad", "nice" or "max". Marty would place greater value on Aces and Kings and discount Queens, but to avoid subjective arguments, let's assume they mean roughly 15-16 and 17 to the unwashed. When I asked about the premise for what I call "Super Duper Accepts" (also known as Bergen Super-Accepts), four letters came rolling back on my screen, LOTT!!! After all, we have 9 trump so we need to be at the 3 level, why wait? Hold onto that thought for a moment.|

"The problem arises when responder has a hand that he intends to transfer and pass. Modern thinking on this technique holds that you transfer anytime you have a 5 card major and it can be done with 0 points." |

^B@2^*BTommy Solberg: ^*N|cp||at|The problem I see with the application of the LOTT is that it is a competitive bidding guideline.

^B@2^*BTommy Solberg: ^*N|cp||at|His "idiots guideline" for me was revalue your hand as a supporting hand and if you have 4 supporting trump and the hand has now grown out of your no trump range, then super accept. Thus, if you have 17 and a doubleton, you revalue to 18 and super accept. Otherwise be content with a standard acceptance.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BTommy Solberg: ^*N|cp||at|You may have been wondering about Marty's recommendation to bid your doubleton suit when you have 4 card trump support and a "nice" hand. This is pretty clever since the no trump opener is now the short trump hand and the additional trump will be of value only if the hand has a ruffing value. |
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BTommy Solberg: ^*N|cp||at|By locating the doubleton for responder, you enable him to better gauge the value of the 4th trump. It may look like this is on the slippery slope to wrong siding the hand, but Marty solved that as well with his concept of "re-transfers." Upon hearing the doubleton bid, responder simply transfers again and now opener bids the major. Everything back to square.|
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BTommy Solberg: ^*N|cp||at|Lets take a final look at Marty's recommendation to bid 2NT when you have 4 trump, 4333 and a max. This is the opposite of the 4332 hand, it may have a 4th trump, but the hand has no ruffing value. It will probably make the same number of tricks in no trump as it will in a major suit even with a 9 card fit. |
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BTommy Solberg: ^*N|cp||at|The 2NT bid is a clear warning to responder about playing a suit contract and the last chance to get off the train by passing 2NT if responder has one of those "transfer and duck" hands.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BTommy Solberg: ^*N|cp||at|If you currently have only one flavor to your Super-Accept, I think you might consider Bergen's technique of bidding the doubleton with 4432 and nice hand and bidding 2NT with a max and 4333. As for three level jumps, I think Danny Kleinman's idiots rule suits me best. If you promise you will always balance over the passed transfer, I may change my mind. :-). |

Bergen's Version:

PG| ***** 204 ***** |


AT|

Howard's Version:
1) If you open 1NT, and partner bids a 2@D/2H transfer, always jump to 3@H/3@S with 4-card support regardless of HCP.

2) If you open 2NT (or rebid 2NT after a 2@C opener), and partner bids a 3@D/3@H transfer, jump to 4@H/4@S with 4-card support.

3) When partner's transfer bid is doubled (lead directing), the NT bidder's responses are as follows:

a) With 2-card support pass. The transfer bidder can then redouble to re-transfer, or make any other appropriate bid (usually 2NT or 3NT).

b) With 3-card support, immediately accept the transfer (e.g.. bid 2@H/2@S over the 2@D/2@H transfer).

c) With 4-card support, Super-Accept.|
