To successfully utilize this convention you need a good grasp of hand categories and hand evaluations. You can find the good tutorials regarding the two topics in the Reference section. Further, unless it is specifically stated all ^*IPoints^*N is High Card Points. When there is a fit the points are referred to as either Dummy or Declarer Points based on Marty Bergen's hand evaluation.

qx|I1,Basic Structure|ht|b|fp|1|cs|1|cp|4|at|^-{  Basic Structure }
^-|ht|c|FP||cs||cp||AT|^B@2^*BMM: ^*NInverted Minor Raises are devised to make sure the partnership avoids bidding a doomed NT contract while they could make a simple partscore, or even game, in one of the minors. To start with let us quote from Susan Doty's web site. Fortunately, I have a saved copy from the site before it went down.|

"After partner opens the bidding with 1@C or 1@D, responder will usually either have a 4 card major suit to show, or a balanced hand suitable for a NT response. Sometimes, though, responder cannot bid either and is forced to  support opener's minor. Playing standard responses, responder can make |
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|

a single raise to 2 of the bid minor (showing 6-9 points) or an invitational raise to 3 of the bid minor (showing 10-12). Responder does not have a way to make a forcing raise with a stronger hand. This is one of the situations that Inverted Minor Raises were designed to deal with. Using ^*B"The Inverted Minor Raises", all you have to do is reverse the meaning of the two and the three  responses--thus inverted.^*N|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|

The basic structure of Inverted Minor Raises is:
^B@2^*BSingle Raise: 1@C/2@C - 1@D/2@D:
Invitational or better values (10+ HCP); 4 card support (preferably 5); No 4 card major; Not suited for a direct 2NT (10-12 balanced) or 3NT (13-15 balanced) responses. 
Note: this bid is forcing for one round.

^B@2^*BJump Raise: 1@C/3@C - 1@D/3@D:
Preemptive (no more than 7 HCP)--About 6 to 9 support points (HCP + Dummy Points); 5+ card support ;  and no 4+card major.
With 8-9 HCP we have too many values to raise preemptively, so bid 1NT instead."  |
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|

- Both the single raise and jump raise must be alerted. 
- The single raise is off after interference. However, the Jump raise is not affected.
- Most expert play Inverted Minor Raises after a passed hand,|

^-|CP||fp||at|
^B@21) If I make a minor raise (to either the 2 level or 3 level), I am guaranteed to have no 4-card major. |
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT|

2) I make a jump raise (to the 3 level) with 5 to a bad 9 points and a 5+ card suit. I might have the other minor, but feel that the jump raise is tactically the right thing to do to make it difficult for the opponents. I will tend to prefer the jump raise to a bid of 1N if I have 5-card support.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


AT| 

3) I make a limit raise with 10+ points and usually 5-card support. (The only time I will have 4-card support is if I am 4-4 in the minors and partner opens 1@D.) If partner opens clubs, I will not have 4 diamonds. If partner opens diamonds, I will not have 5+ clubs (in SAYC; in 2 over 1,  1@D/2@C is slightly more complicated).|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


AT| 

4) Opener should now respond with his lowest stopper. If responder has less than a game-forcing hand, he should continue to bid stoppers below three of the agreed upon suit, or 2N if he has ^*Iall the other suits stopped^*N. |
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


AT|

5) If responder has a game-forcing hand, he must make sure the partnership bids game by either bidding 3N, if all suits are stopped, or continue bidding new suits, if not. Again, new suits are forcing.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


AT|

6) Similarly, if opener has 15+ points, it is his responsibility to make sure the partnership reaches game by either bidding 3N, if all suits are stopped, or continuing to bid new suits, if not. |
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


AT|

7) Once 3 suits have been bid (the original suit and 2 stopper suits), if someone bids the fourth suit, that is asking about a stopper rather than telling, because if the bidder has the remaining suit stopped, he can bid NT himself. |FP||
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


AT|

8) Inverted minors are off in competition (including over takeout doubles), in the sense that a raise to 2 is less than a limit raise. A raise to 3 is still preemptive.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |

Next step let us look at a few examples. In all you are sitting South and your partner opens one of the minors. |

The correct bid is 3@C. This is the simplest part of Inverted Minor Raises. Responder says the following:
A. I have no more than 7 HCP--About 6 to 9 support points (HCP + Dummy Points).
B. I do not have a 4 card major.
C. I have 5+ card support. 
D. With 8-9 HCP I would have bid 1NT instead.|

Generally, opener passes unless has enough strength to bid 3N or game in the minor.|

This bid is forcing for one round and the partnership mainly will explore for a safe NT or a partscore in the minor bid. Before, we learn this process we need to learn what is a full or half-stopper.|

qx|I2, Full and Half-Stoppers|ht|b|fp|1|cs|1|cp|4|at|^-{  Stoppers }
^-|ht|c|FP||cs||cp||AT|^B@2^*BMM: ^*NIn Notrump, often, declarer needs to give up the lead to establish one or two other suits. He needs protection in his short suits to prevent the opponents running those suits. Those protections are ^*Bstoppers^*N. They are protected honor in 2+-card combinations. A short suit then may have none, a half, one, or more stopper. ^*BOne half-stopper (in the dummy) combined with another (in hand) will give the declarer one full stopper.^*N|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


AT|

All ^*Bunprotected singleton honors excluding the ace^*N and ^*Bxxx ^*N(3 small cards in short suits) have no stoppers.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


AT|

All the following holdings have two stoppers:
^*BA K
K Q J
Q J T 9
A Q x ^*N(If the K is under the suit, there are two stoppers; if the K is over it, there is only one).|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |

All the following holdings have one stopper:
^*BA
K Q
Q J T
J 10 x x
K J x x ^*N(If the A and Q are under it, both the K and the J can stop the suit, however, if both the A and Q are over it, the K and the J are useless). ^*BK^*Nx has a particular position. It is a full stopper on opening lead if Kx is in declarer's hand (because if the suit is led, it is guaranteed to win a trick). But it is an iffy stopper if it is in dummy.|

%%Follow-up bids
qx|I3,Follow up bids|ht|b|fp|1|cs|1|cp|4|at|^-{  Follow-Up Bids }
^-|ht|c|FP||cs||cp||AT|^B@2^*BMM: ^*NAfter partner opens the bidding with 1@C or 1@D and you bid 3@C or 3@D respectively the rebid by opener is simple. In most instances he bids pass and the partnership plays in a partscore. On occasions, opener has a huge hand and can bid 3N with other suits stopped or game in minor bid.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


AT|

However, if the bidding goes 1@C-P-2@C-P or 1@D-P-2@D-P the partnership starts bidding the cheapest full-stoppers in the other three suits up the line. The first partner who is assured that the three suits are stopped bids either 2NT or 3NT based on his hand's strength. This can happen with opener's first rebid assuming he has all the requirements to do so. On the other hand, the partnership stops at partscore in the bid minor if they are lacking full stopper in one of the suits.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


AT|

First we deal with when both partner have full stoppers. Let us look at a few examples.|

With an invitational or better hand, with no 4-card major, with 4+-card in support, and playing Inverted Minor Raises the correct bid is 2@D.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


mb|p|sk|n|NT||lb|*bWhat should North bid?  ^^2h|mb|2h!|AN|Heart stopper|nt|^b@2
By biding 2@H, the cheapest stopper up the line, North is ^*BT^*Nelling he has a heart stopper. North also has spade stopper but needs to first bid the cheapest stopper up the line. Some experts consider opener has all suits stopped and bid 2NT. However, other experts consider @CQ 4 3 half-stopper and wish to get more information from partner.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


AT|

BTW, in this bidding sequence and other similar ones because responder did not bid NT or a new suit the 2@H is not a reverse.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


MB|p|nt||sk|s|lb|*bWhat should you bid?  ^^3c|mb|3c!|AN|Club stopper|NT|^B@2
3@C is the cheapest up the line stopper which South holds. Therefore, he is ^*BT^*Nelling partner about it.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


MB|p|sk||lb|*bWhat would you bid here?  ^^3n|mb|3nppp|NT|^B@2
With all suits stopped opener bids a safe 3N. Please not that North does not have to show (^*BT^*Nell) the spade stopper by bidding 3@S when he has it and the other two suits are stopped. With another hand if North bids 3@S it has a different meaning. By bidding 3@S in that sequence North will be ^*BA^*Nsking whether partner has a half-stopper in spades or not. We will learn how to differentiate between ^*BT^*Nelling and ^*BA^*Nsking soon. |
PG| ***** 43 ***** |

To drive home the importance of the cheapest stopper up the line let us change the North's holding.|

3@D by South is the correct bid ^*BT^*Nelling partner he has a diamond stopper. So two of the three suits are stopped and all the ^*BT^*Nelling process is over. So either North has a spade stopper and bids 3N or bids 4@C denying a stopper in spades. Of course if North has a half-stopper in spades he will be asking for a complimenting half by bidding 3@S. That is ^*BA^*nsking. Let us look.|

You are playing Inverted Minor Raises and the bidding is as you see above. As a reminder please note that when playing Inverted Minor Raises, a single raise promises the following:
Invitational or better values (10+ HCP); 4+ card support (preferably 5); No 4 card major; Not suited for a direct 2NT (10-12 balanced) or 3NT (13-15 balanced) responses.

NT||lb|*bWhat should South bid?^^2n|NT|^B@2
South has the heart suit stopped. Therefore, he signifies that information by bidding 2N. South is not strong enough to bid bid 3N. Further, South should not bid3@H to tell the whole world that he has hearts stopped. As you already know the 3@H is an ^*BA^*Nsking bid.|MB|2NP|

The hand has 14 Starting Points. South still can bid 2@C. However, the second obligation is to bid NT when the hand is balanced with all suits stopped--as here. So, South should bid 3NT. ^*BYou do not have to bid Inverted Minor Raises just because you know how to play it -:)^*N.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Some expert may not like to make the 3N bid because it takes up too much room and precludes looking for slam. On the other hand they agree, you need sophisticated methods for finding out if you have a minor suit slam or not. Therefore, for most of us 3N is probably best. You would not be reading this tutorial if you knew those sophisticated methods.|

nt||lb|*bWhat should North bid now?^^3h|mb|3h|AN||have 1/2 heart stopper/Asking|NT|^B@2
The 3@H bid by North is a critical bid. Obviously it is not a full stopper because North did not ^*BT^*Nell it on the first round (bid 2@S). Further, North could simply bid 3N with hearts stopped. Please note the clubs and spades, two suits, are stopped. The ^*BT^*Nelling time is over and North has a half-stoppers (@HJ 10 9) in hearts and ^*BA^*Nsking whether South has another half-stopper in hearts to compliment the heart holding by North.|mb|p|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North need not bid 3@H (asking for a half heart stopper) because he should know that South has a half heart stopper. Here is the logic (and it is a bit complicated). With no heart stopper, South would have bid 3@D since he knows hearts are not stopped (see previous Example 11). With both hearts and clubs stopped South would have bid 2N or 3N. Therefore, 3@C must show a full club stopper and half stopper in hearts. So North can confidently bid 3N.

nt||lb|*bWhat should North bid?^^2S|NT|^B@2
Again two suits are stopped. The partner who is in line has the third suit stopped and bids NT at the appropriate level. Lacking any stopper North should bid the bid minor. However, with half-stopper in the third suit (spades here) bids that suit.|mb|2S|AN|ASKING|

NT|^B@2
It is simple to recognize whether a bid is ^*BT^*Nelling or ^*BAsking because the Inverted Minor Raises structure is very logical. As you may recall after a single raise the partners must bid the cheapest stopper up the line. Therefore, there will be a conclusion not later than the third bid after the single raise. The partnership either ends up in 3N, game in the minor bid, or partscore in in the minor bid. |
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Therefore, when one of the partners bids a suit which he has already denied having a stopper in, it is an ^*BAsking bid. An ^*BAsking bid in a suit, therefore, shows half-stopper and asks partner to bid NT with a half-stopper in that suit. |
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


NT||AT|
^B@2^*BMM: ^*NThat is the simple part. The trouble begins to successfully determine which is a half-stopper in the dummy or in hand. As we already know Kx for example, is a stopper if it is in declarer's hand. If it is in Dummy it is an iffy stopper. If that suit is led, then the K is only a stopper if the A is in the leader's hand. That skill along with a little luck will go a long way to avoid bad NT contracts.|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


NT||AT|
^B@2^*BMM: ^*NFurther, I have a simple rule in my memory bank which says:
If one of us after two suits are establish with stoppers and bid something other than the bid minor or NT, it must be an asking bid. It is on the same line as, "The dog did not bark." 

And I crown any 3-card combination containing one top honor below King a half-stopper. Please do not call me if you end up in bad NT contract based on my rule -:).|

Because you need only nine tricks for a no trump game contract while you need 11 tricks for a minor suit game contract--assuming the partnership had the required points. In that case:|

^B@2Responder does not have a way to make a forcing raise with a stronger hand. This is one of the situations that Inverted Minor Raises were designed to deal with. Also, playing Inverted Minor Raises prevents partnership bidding a doomed NT contract |

Playing Inverted Minor Raises, after partner opens the bidding with 1@C or 1@D, and responder does not have a 4 card major suit to show, or a ^*Ibalanced^*N hand suitable for a NT response. He does one of the following:|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


AT|

^*BI^*N. A jump raise shows a hand with no more than 9 Dummy Points, no 4-card major, and a 5-card fit for opener's suit--1@C-P-3@C/1@D-P-3@D. 
Opener should have an exceptional hand to bid again.
Requirements for the jump raise are:
1. No 4-card major suit.
2. Any 5-card support.|
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


AT|

^*BII^*N. A single raise shows a good hand with 10 or more HCP; no 4-card major; and a 5-card fit for partner's suit--1@C-P-2@C/1@D-P-3@D. 
The single raise is forcing for one round.
Requirements for the single raise are:
1. No 4-card major suit.
2. Good 5-card support.|
PG| ***** 140 ***** |


AT|

The search for a safe NT contract begins after a single raise by responder. Opener should bid his lowest stopper up the line. Responder keeps the bidding open by bidding the next stopper. Either, opener or responder can bid NT in the appropriate level when all suits are stopped. If not either can retreat to the bid minor. |
PG| ***** 141 ***** |


AT|

Once 3 suits have been bid (the original suit and 2 stopper suits), if someone bids the fourth suit, that is ^*BA^*Nsking about a stopper rather than telling, because if the bidder has the remaining suit stopped, he can bid NT himself. |FP||
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


AT|

Inverted minors are off in competition (including over takeout doubles), in the sense that a raise to 2 is less than a limit raise. A raise to 3 is still preemptive.|
