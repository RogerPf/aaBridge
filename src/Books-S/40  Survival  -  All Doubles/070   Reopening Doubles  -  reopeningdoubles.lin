FP||CS||CP||at|
A search for Reopening Double on the Internet gives about 3,150,000 results. I found |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://kwbridge.com/bb/habits-8b.htm,"The 12 Habits of Highly Effective Bidders (August 2006)"^*N|CP||FP||at| article by Karen Walker to be the best. 

The next great one with its simple explanation is from ^*bStandard Bidding in SAYC^*N, Master Point Press, Toronto - ISBN 1 -897106-03-3 by Ned Downey and Ellen Pomer, BBO nickname (caitlin). I am sure you all know the long time BIL's great teacher Ellen. Her book opened my eyes to the mysterious world of SAYC. 

In my early days of learning bridge, reading it taught me what really SAYC was. Ever since, when I am looking for a good and short explanation I refer to it. In those dark days and when I first heard the word ^*ISA-SEE^*N (as I thought it was spelled then) was some potion used mostly by seniors for its certain (unknown to me) specific medicinal effects.

Another good read is a blog by Tommy Solberg, BBO nickname "tommylee"

You may not wish to defend a contract at 2 level.|

AT|
You may not be able to safely bid 2@D or another suit.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Your partnership plays negative double.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


AT|
Opponents stopped at 2 level. Therefore the points are almost evenly distributed.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


NT|^B@2
What are the possible scenarios?|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Partner is really weak and has nothing to say.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


AT|
Partner has no support for opener's suit but has length and strength in opponent's suit. However, cannot double for penalty as that would be a negative double.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Do you have other options?|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Yes, you do. Your options vary based on your hand. Let us look at them.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


AT| 

Pass when holding three cards or more in the overcall suit (as is shown above)|HC|CQ93|at| in order to defend based on the inference that partner has no values.|MD|0SAK653 hq8DA63C Q93,0,0,|mb|p|

st||RH||AH|b|PN|You,,Partner,|sv|o|sk|S|md|1sak653da6c3hkq654,,,|mb|1s2cpp|NT|^B@2
In the case that you have substantially more values (as is shown above) to continue the auction independently.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


AT|  Then you should take such action by bidding another unbid suit-2@H here for example.|MB|2h|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


ub||NT|^B@2
Or, with different holding (not shown here),|SK|n|at| using a cuebid per partnership agreement and allowing partner to make a preference bid.|mb|3c|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As opener, as a rule of thumb, always reopen with a double when you are short in the overcall suit and when holding support for the unbid suits.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As responder, when you are short in opener's suit, have length and honors in the overcall suit, and no good bid to make pass and await further developments.|

st||RH||AH|c|PN|You,,Partner,|sv|o|sk|S|md|1,,,|mb|1s2cppxp|NT|^B@2
Responder after a Reopening Double has the following choices:
1. Bid his/her best suit. 
2. Raise the suit of the partner with a minimum of two or more but no less. 
3. Pass for penalty when holding length and defensive values in the suit of the opponent.|

Is there a rule of thumb or guideline for 
when to pass and

cs||FP||CP||NT|^B@2
Yes, many experts use |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=ruleof9,Rule of 9^*N|CP||FP||at| while some experts dislike ^*bRules^*n in general and rely on experience. They go by the length and strength in the overcall suit and lack of support for partner. Also check out |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/Rule9.html,Rule of 9^*N|CP||FP||at| from bridgeguys|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


%%http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/Rule9.html
NT|^B@2
However, Rule of Nine can assist less experienced partner in arriving at the best auction when forced to respond. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The responder (North here) adds the following:
a. the level of the contract;
b. the number of cards held in the suit of the opponent;
c. the number of honors held in the suit of the opponent (this includes the 10).|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT|^B@2
1. If the sum is |CP|8|AT|nine or more|CP||AT|, then the partner, North, should pass for penalty.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


AT|

2. If the sum is |CP|8|AT|eight or less|CP||AT|, then the partner, North, should bid on.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


%%
sk|n|MD|0,0,cAQ987|NT|^B@2
For example, with clubs holding as is shown above Rule of 9 says North should pass for penalty.|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


MB|P|AT|
Because the sum is 9 (2 for contract level, 5 for number of cards held in opponent's suit, and 2 for number of honors held in that suit).|

NT||
st||RH||AH|d|PN|You,,Partner,|sv|o|sk|n|md|1,,sj2ht54cA976dt765,|mb|1s2cppxp|NT|^B@2
In this example North should bid on as the sum is 7 (2 for contract level, 4 for the number of cards held in the overcalled suit and 1 for the number of the honor in that suit).|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


MB|2S|AT| For example 2@S here.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I do not like the Rule of 9. One big flaw is, it does not take into account how many cards you hold in partner's suit.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you have a singleton or void in pard's suit, that says you are likely to pass if you have length in the opponent's suit. If you have 2, it is marginal to pass. If you have 3 in pard's suit, it is almost never right to pass, regardless of what the Rule of 9 says.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, on hand c, I would pass with AQxx of clubs with shortness in spades. In fact, I might even pass with AQx of clubs. And I would pass with Axxx of clubs if short in spades.|

{    "Mandatory" reopening doubles    }
^-|
FP||CS||CP||at|
No matter how exotic or complex your agreements, the heart of your system is a set of basic guidelines that just about everybody accepts as ^*Bgood bridge^*N. They range from simple advice like ^*Bnever rebid a preempt to more complex principles like the Law of Total Tricks^*N.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


AT|

Theories change over time, and some ideas that were accepted years ago are now considered old-fashioned or, in some cases, even bad bridge. Today's players use the old rules as guidelines, but they rely on their judgment to tell them when it's wise to make exceptions.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


ht|j|AT|

^*BThe old advice^*N:  In an auction such as 1@D - 1@H - Pass - Pass, opener should reopen with a double if he's short in the opponent's suit.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


ht|j|AT|

^*BThe old advice^*N:  In an auction such as 1@D - 1@H - Pass - Pass, opener should reopen with a double if he's short in the opponent's suit.|ht|l|AT|

^*BNew:^*N  The negative double is one of the most valuable of all conventions, but it can sometimes create complications when partner does not use it. As opener in the above auction, you always suspect that partner's silence may be based on a desire to penalize the overcall. A widely held view is that you should cater to that possibility by reopening with a double if at all possible.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


AT|

To some, ^*bif at all possible^*n means any hand with shortness in the overcalled suit and support for unbid suits. Others play the double as virtually mandatory with shortness, no matter what your outside distribution.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


AT|

A common misconception is that you're doubling ^*bfor^*n partner, as if he were always in a position to make a unilateral decision to defend. It's true that he could have a monster trump stack and want to double no matter what you hold. More often, though, partner needs information from you. Even with strong trumps, he may not want to double a one-bid unless he knows your hand is suitable for defense.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


AT|

A Reopening Double should tell partner you have that hand. An ideal holding is at least 2 ½ quick tricks and three or more cards in the unbid suits.^*N|

A hand such as shown above is a good one. You won't always have the perfect hand, so you have to decide how closely your actual hand matches the one partner will expect for a Reopening Double.|

How about this hand?|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


lb|*bWhat would you bid? Keep trying until you get the correct answer.^^1s|NT|^B@2
This is stronger than the example above, but it's not a good candidate for a double. In general, you should avoid defending with a trump void, especially at the one level. The void and the extra length in unbid suits make your hand more suitable for offense, so bid 1S with this pattern.|MB|1s|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Another reason to reject the double is that you won't be able to help on defense. If partner passes the double, it's often important for you to lead a trump through declarer. When you can't, partner may be endplayed in the trump suit.|

The hand shown above meets all the ^*Bif at all possible^*n criteria that some players advocate for Reopening Doubles, and you even have a trump to lead.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, if you stop thinking about the rules and instead focus on evaluating your whole hand, you should be convinced that it's better to send a ^*Bwe should declare^*n message.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This hand has ^*Bslow^*n quick tricks whose defensive potential is weakened by the long suit. Your long, topless suit and concentrated values argue for offense,|

Only two defensive tricks and lots of jacks, but what else can you do but double? Pass is far too timid, and 1@S suggests an offense-oriented hand with at least nine cards in your suits.|

st||pn||rh||AH|Reopening Double|ah|Board 4|md|1,,,|sv||mb|1s2hpp?|NT|^B@2
The level of the overcall (higher overcalls) should affect your decision. Doubling a two-level bid offers greater rewards, so it can pay to take more risks with Reopening Doubles. Voids and long suits are less of a liability because the contract is a level higher.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Weak support for unbid suits, however, is a greater liability at higher levels. Keep in mind that on most deals, partner isn't trap-passing. He's just weak, so you'll want to avoid doubling with a hand that will have you saying ^*bSorry, partner^*N when you put down the dummy.|HT|x|at|^sKaren Walker|
