^B@2Support Doubles occurs after four consecutive bids. It is the fifth bid in the sequence. Support double is a convention that allows opener, in a competitive auction, to differentiate between 3-card and 4-card support when responder has bid a major. Let us see how it happens at the bridge table.|

PG| ***** 16 ***** |


AT| It is simple. With a minimum opener you raise. With a stronger hand you could make an invitational 3@H bid or even consider game in hearts with much stronger hand. That is all.|

What if you had only 2-card support-as is shown above-you may ask. Well, I guess you have to make some other bid. You cannot find all your bridge questions here :). Pass seems to be a good and safe option here.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||lb|*mBTW, how many spades your Partner is promising?^4~5+^2|NT|^B@2
Of course he should have 5 or more spades. With only 4 spades partner would double-Negative Double.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


AT| Before we do one more round let me share a pearl from Howard's recent mentoring session related to what we discussed.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


lc|skj|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the auction 1 minor-1@H-?, there is only 1 unbid major (spades). But there are 2 bids available to show spades, a negative double and 1@S. So experts differentiate between the meanings of the 2 bids. A negative double shows exactly 4 spades. And a bid of 1@S shows 5 or more spades.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If the auction goes 1 minor-1@S-?, it is true that both double and 2@H show hearts. But 2@H promises 10+ and 5+ hearts. You would negative double if a) you only have 4 hearts or b) you have fewer than 10 points (or both). So the auction 1 minor-1@H-dbl has a somewhat different meaning than the auction 1 minor-1@S-dbl.)|

PG| ***** 28 ***** |


AT| Now, you bring down the hammer and double.|SB|SI bid a Support Double to announce my 3-card support for my partner.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That Support Double tells the world that you have 3-card support and the other secrets of your hand is still secret|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


AT|. That brings us to the complicated alert issue. To sum all the information on alerting support double I would like to have the following quote from Larry Cohen.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT|^B@2
"I alert every single action by opener. If asked what the ALERT to "Pass" means, I just say: "Denies three spades." I can't see how it can ever be a problem to "over- alert" when you have information which your opponents are entitled to know."|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As you noticed the action by your RHO (the opponent to the right of the opener) is critical for bidding a Support Double. Generally, most partnerships use Support Doubles when the fourth-bid (the bid by RHO) is at 1-level even a 1NT and is not above 2-of-responder's (Partner's) suit.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


AT| Therefore, if the bidding goes as is shown next,|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT||
%%take 5
st||pn|You,LHO,Partner,RHO|rh||ah|Support Doubles - Take 5|md|1,,,|sv|0|mb|1dp1s2h|NT|^B@2

pg| ***** 37 ***** |


UB|2|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


mb|3C|at| for example 3@C as is shown above then you are promising extra value in addition to 3-card support. It needs partnership thorough discursion.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||
%%take 5a
st||pn|You,LHO,Partner,RHO|rh||ah|Support Doubles - Take 5a|md|1,,,|sv|0|NT|^B@2
Moreover, there is a Support Redouble.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


AT| If the auction goes 1C-P-1S-dbl-redbl|mb|1Cp1sXR|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That is a "support redouble" again showing 3-card support.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |

Next, let's look at more examples.|

NT||

ht|b|AT|^B{|ia|1C1H1S1NX|at|}|HF|g|lb|*yIs the double by West a Support Double?^^y|ht|g|AT|^b@2Yes. But, some may say,"There is not as much need to differentiate between 3-card support and 4-card support. If opener knows that partner has 5+ spades, he can comfortably raise to 2@S with 3-card support knowing that their side has at least an 8-card fit." Of course we are advanced and know about the negative doubles. So, the support double here still is a good bid and clearly tells partne that there are 3-card support is available. But as Howard says, "Both have merit -:).|

Sure, Support Double is a great bid. You will get a chance to show your strength later. There is no limit for the hand strength. Of course you would have opened 2@C if you had a stronger hand.|
