{      The 2NT Response to a Weak Two Bid    }

{    Introduction    }
^-|cp||fp||cs||AT|
^B@2Although a Weak Two bid is very descriptive, beside being disruptive, there are times when responder needs more information to determine the best contract. Responder needs to know whether opener has a minimum or a maximum for the Weak Two Bid and whether there is a fit present. Let us look at two hands side by side:|

However the hand on the left with 6 HCP is at the bottom and the hand on the right with 10 HCP is at the top of the 5-11 HCP range for Weak Two bids. Further, the hand on the right has a great side suit in hearts. This feature combined with 10 HCP could be a good fit for responder to be in a game—probably in 3N. But how can opener convey this information to the Responder ? |

However, I believe your partnership would do fine by playing either 2NT-Show a Feature or 2NT-Ogust. Regardless, the 2NT bid is 100% forcing.|

^-|CP||fp||ht|d|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If your partner opens a weak-2, and you bid 2N, that is a conventional bid asking partner for a further description of their weak-2. It asks both about suit quality and the hand strength-HCP. Let me define a few terms important to Ogust convention.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


ht|g|AT|"Bad suit" is one lacking two of the top three honors. |
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


ht|g|AT|"Bad suit" is one lacking two of the top three honors.| 
ht|h|AT|"Good suit" is one with two of top three honors. A suit headed by AK AQ or KQ.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


ht|g|AT|"Bad suit" is one lacking two of the top three honors.| 
ht|h|AT|"Good suit" is one with two of top three honors. A suit headed by AK AQ or KQ.|

ht|g|AT|"Bad suit" is one lacking two of the top three honors.| 
ht|h|AT|"Good suit" is one with two of top three honors. A suit headed by AK AQ or KQ.|
ht|i|AT|"Bad  hand", has 5-7 HCP.|
ht|j|AT|"Good hand", has 8-10 HCP.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


ht|k|AT|
So, your suit either is "Bad" or "Good" and you either have "Bad" or "Good" hand. Therefore, there are 4 combinations you can talk about "good/bad hand" and "good/bad suit." And, thus there are four responses.|

PG| ***** 16 ***** |


 
ht|n|at|3@C bid promises a "Bad Hand" and a "Bad Suit" hand--Bad/Bad.
3@D bid promises a "Bad Hand" and a "Good Suit" hand-- Bad/Good.
3@H bid promises a "Good Hand" and a "Bad Suit" hand--Good/Bad.
3@S bid promises a "Good Hand" and a "Good Suit" hand--Good/Good.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


ht|s|at|So, a minor suit bid shows a bad hand, and a major suit bid shows a good hand point count wise.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


AT| 

However, there is another style of Ogust which simply reverses 3@D and 3@H. In this version 3@D shows a good hand and a bad suit and 3@H shows a bad hand and a good suit. In this variation the minors show a bad suit and the majors show a good suit. I don't think it matters which you play, although I believe, at least in the US, the version I play is more popular. But obviously you need to check with your partner.|

^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|Howard, that was great explanation. But let us assume my partner opens a Weak Two (2@D for example) and the next opponent passes. What type of hand do I need to bid 2N?|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Before I get into specific let me give you a key messages of using Ogust convention. You should not overuse Ogust. The law of total tricks and your dummy points often tell you what to do. Ogust only should be used for those in-between hands, which do not occur all that often.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


cp||AT|

^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|Then, would you please give us your guideline.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me first discuss what to do when partner opens 2H or 2S. In that case, your first thought should be whether or not you want to play in game in opener's suit. It is almost always easier to play in a suit, particularly when one hand is weak, than it is to play in NT. And your primary guideline should be the Law of Total Tricks. So, let us say you are on the table and partner bids let us say 2H and you have the following hands. First, you choose your bid then I will give you my critique and recommendations. I will be your partner. For clarity we are not going to show the entire hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you have 4-card support, raise to 4, regardless of how many points you have. This is clear Law of Total Tricks bid, since you know your side has 10 trumps. This is the same reasoning as your jumping to 4 with 5-card support when your partner opens 1 of a major. Occasionally, you might have enough for slam, but that is rare enough that it is not worth worrying about.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you have 3-card support and at least 4 points, you should raise to 3 at least. Again, this is based on the Law of Total Tricks (you have 9 trumps, so you are safe bidding a 9 trick contract). Below I will discuss when you should think about bidding 4, but I want to emphasize that, if your partner opens a Weak Two and you have 3-card support, you must at a minimum bid 3 regardless of your point count. Bridge experts call this "furthering the preempt" and it is a very effective tactic.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ok, so the next question is, assuming you have 2-card or 3-card support, when should you think about bidding game? Well, let's first think about what partner can have and how many Bergen declarer points that translates to. We know for a fact that partner is promising 5-10 HCP and a 6-card suit. First of all, we can add 2 points for the six card length. So we are up to 7-12 Bergen starting points. Now we also have to take distribution into account. Let's look at the most common distributions for opener.|

^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|What about playing 3N? |
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, with 2+ card support, it is almost always better to play in a major suit. And with a singleton or void in partner's suit, NT will be difficult unless you have your own source of tricks. |CP|8|at|So, never try to "rescue" partner if you have a singleton or void in their suit.|cp||
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


AT|

There are a few instances where I favor 3N over 4 of a major. And that is when I can count 9 tricks. So, if I have a hand with a doubleton or tripleton honor (A, K, or Q), I might consider 3N when I can count 9 tricks based on the Ogust response. The most obvious example is when I have a doubleton or tripleton honor and 3 Aces. Then, if in response to 2N, partner shows a good suit (2 of the top 3 honors), I can count 9 tricks (six in opener's suit plus 3 aces). Of course, most hands are not that obvious. |
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


AT|

The general rule I use is I "picture" partner having AQxxxx of his suit and nothing else. If I am willing to play 3NT opposite that holding, I would bid Ogust. Similarly, if I am willing to play 3 of our suit with that holding, and 3N if partner has a max, then I also bid Ogust, bidding 3N if partner shows a good hand with a good suit.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


AT|

Of course, if I have a maximum opener (18+), I am willing to play game opposite just about any 6 point hand, so I might bid 3N with a balanced hand with 2 card support (or even a singleton if I can count 9 outside tricks). If I have 16 or 17, I would tend to favor 4 of the major over 3N, although if I were willing to play 3 of the major, I might bid Ogust just in case partner shows 8-10 HCP.|

cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Glad to explain. Many people have devised somewhat complicated systems over doubles (if interested, read about DOPI, DOPE, and DEPO), but I use a simple approach, based on stolen bid doubles. Generally speaking, pass means I would have responded with a bid below whatever the overcall was, double means the opponents "stole" my bid, and otherwise I bid what I would have without interference. There are some slight variations, depending on what is overcalled.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |

1) Over 3D, pass means I would have responded 3C, double means I would have responded 3D, and 3H and 3S mean the same as if there were no interference.|

2) Over 3H, pass means I would have responded 3C or 3D, double means I would have responded 3H, and 3S means the same as if there were no interference.|

AT|

3) Over 3S, pass means I would have responded 3C or 3D, and double means I would have responded 3H or 3S.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


AT|

4) Over 3C, you can just use the normal approach -- double means I would have responded 3C and 3D/3H/3S mean the same as if there were no interference. Since pass is also available, I play a small wrinkle, but it is certainly optional, and you need not play it. If I pass, that says I would have bid 3C, but I have some defense and am willing to play 3C. If I double, that says I opened the usual hondo trash with little defense.|
