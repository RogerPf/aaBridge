^-|fp||cp||va|4|at|^b@2^*I Originating from an old Whist maxim glibly set forth as "Second Hand low, Third Hand high," but nowadays more often abused than properly respected. The subsequent analysis will throw much light on the efficacy of this principle of play, or, under certain conditions, its disadvantages.

That is a footnote to Watson's Chapter XVIII. From early on I learned "Third Hand High" as an ironclad rule and obeyed it. Later, I found out that there are exceptions to the rule. Here for my own sanity I tried to find and collect all the exceptions in one place. As usual, I reviewed Howard's mentoring sessions and his online lessons, reviewed the two great BBO movies by Fred Gitelman, ^*ILearn to Play Bridge I and II^*N, read the Chapter XVIII from Watson's book, ^*IThe Play of the Hand at Bridge^*N at |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/y31j7w^*N|CP||AT|, and finally I studied Chapter VIII from ^*IDefensive Bridge Play^*N by Edwin B. Kantar (which, BTW, is a great book on defense). Then, I put them all together as I catalogued them into my fading memory bank for submission to Howard for his updating, corrections and editing. Also, I need to thank Marge DeFries, BBO nickname "Mardef" whose expert editing makes this presentation professional. What you will read next is the result. |

This presentation is the way I like to learn this complex issue. You should do your own research and at least review the book by Edwin Kantar or the other mentioned authors or other sources. After finishing my collections and doing this presentation I learned of a great BBO movie based on Kantar's book by Fred Gitelman, ^*IEddie Kantar Teaches Modern Bridge Defense^*N which is an interactive CD. It is a great teaching tool for any level. I would not have made this movie hand I known of it before. However, nothing has been lost as my work is really a brief explanation of Third Hand play. I strongly suggest you look at the CD for more extensive explanation of this and many other defense related  topics. You can get more information on the CD from Master Point Press at ^*Hwww.masterpointpress.com/^*N or from "Our Online Store" section in BBO. |

PG| ***** 6 ***** |


CP|8|fp|2|AT|

III|CP||fp||AT|.  Third Hand can never have a card directly below the one he played if Third Hand plays high.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


CP|8|fp|2|AT|

IV|CP||fp||AT|.  When playing Third Hand high, look at dummy's holding. If the dummy contains a card which completes your broken equals or broken honor sequence, then play the lowest card from the completed equals or completed honor sequence.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


CP|8|fp|2|AT|

V|CP||fp||AT|.  When dummy has one honor card and Third Hand has a ^*Ihigher^*N honor, Third Hand normally saves his honor unless the honor is played by dummy. Third Hand must have a card as high as the nine to play if the honor is not played from dummy.  Lacking a nine or higher to play, Third Hand plays the honor. Make sure you do not finesse against the partner.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


CP|8|fp|2|AT|

VI|CP||fp||AT|.  When dummy has an honor that is higher than Third Hand's honor but plays low, Third Hand should ignore the honor in dummy and play high.
|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


CP|8|fp|2|AT|
VII|CP||fp||AT|.  Holding King-Queen doubleton in third seat could change which honor to play when dummy holds the Ace. With the Ace in dummy playing equal honor cards high/low indicates a doubleton. |

^-|ht|g|cp||fp||at|^b@2First, let us sit East and wait for partner's lead. While waiting let us be reminded that some of the exceptions to the "Third Hand High" rule is due to whether the contract is no-trump or in a suit. Further, let us assume that the opponents reached their auction without an interference. I do not have enough time nor the knowledge base in bridge to deal with those variances where there is bidding by the opponents.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |

We will start our journey with principle I, after partner's opening lead hits the table and the dummy is exposed. The lead usually is a low card, most likely a fourth best. I am sure you know how to play when you are lucky and partner leads the top of an honor sequence (from an honor sequence of at least two in a suit contract and not less than three in no-trump).  With those in mind let us look at a few examples where "Third Hand High" is clearly obvious and should be obeyed.  |

Because the @H10 and the @HJ are equals and if you had the @HJ10 combination, you would play the ten and not the Jack.

That is fine but declarers usually do not like to give helpful information to the defense. Further, you have to watch for false carding. The next case is an actual hand from BBO. When there are not enough good opponents around I play with GIBs. The following hand is a recent one. A good feature playing with GIBs is we can openly communicate and hone our defense.

And, Howard later wrote back,"Your inference was incorrect. In Board 3, earlier board, it is true because declarer won the @HJ with the @HA, he could not have the @HQ. But the reason you know that is because you have the @HK. Declarer, on the other hand, tries to hide his cards. So he tends to win tricks with ^*Bthe highest card in a sequence^*N. |
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That provides the least information to the defense. Basically, playing the lowest card in a sequence provides the most information. So a defender wants to provide the most information, whereas a declarer wants to provide the least information (since the dummy could care less what declarer plays). So, on this board, it is right to win with @DK, because that way the defense is not sure who has the Queen."|

nt|^b@2
Why you may ask. According to the Third Hand high rule we must play the heart Jack because the @HQJ are equals.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That is correct, but look at the @H10 in the dummy. That card makes your @H9 also as the equal of the @HQJ. Thus, you should play the @H9.|
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


hc|h9|pc|h9|lc|h9|nt|^b@2 
If you play the @HJ, partner will conclude that declarer has the @H9.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


AT| So, we have another addendum to the "Third Hand High" rule which goes as follows:|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


tc|r|nt||fp|3|cs|8|cp|4|at|^-
{
  When playing Third Hand high, look at dummy's holding and make sure  
none of your spot cards are equal to one of your honor cards.
Play that card if it becomes your honor's equal.
}
^-|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


cp||cs||fp||nt|^b@2
So, if partner leads low and dummy holds say @H1086 the Third Hand should play @H9 from @HQJ9 and not the Jack. |
PG| ***** 88 ***** |

PG| ***** 202 ***** |


at|

When playing Third Hand high, play the lower or lowest from equals.|
PG| ***** 203 ***** |


at|

When partner leads low, dummy has an honor card, Third Hand has a higher honor and dummy plays low, Third Hand conserves the honor if a nine-spot or higher can be played.|
PG| ***** 204 ***** |


at|

At notrump, and frequently against a suit contract, if partner leads an honor and Third Hand has a doubleton honor, Third Hand usually unblocks or overtakes.  In other words, play that honor.|
PG| ***** 205 ***** |


at|

At notrump go all out to preserve communications with partner's hand.  When partner leads from a likely doubleton in your bid suit, try to let declarer win any trick she has coming, allowing partner to retain her remaining card in case partner has a quick outside entry.|
PG| ***** 206 ***** |


AT|

Use the Rule of Eleven when partner leads a likely fourth-highest card to determine how many cards above the one that was led are in declarer's hand.  If the rule doesn't work, partner has not led a fourth-highest card.  Revise your plan.|
PG| ***** 207 ***** |


AT|

When returning partner's suit, return the higher of two remaining cards, the lowest of three remaining cards.|
PG| ***** 208 ***** |


AT|

When dummy wins the first lead of a suit and Third Hand has a perfect honor sequence (QJ10), Third Hand should play the highest equal honor.  However, if dummy plays low, Third Hand plays her lowest equal honor.|
