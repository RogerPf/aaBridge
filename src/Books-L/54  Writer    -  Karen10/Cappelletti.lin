                     Introduction:|fp|1|at|

Cappelletti/Hamilton/Pottage is a Defense Method over a No Trump (NT) opening by the opponents,
used in either direct seat or in the balancing seat.
When the opponents open 1NT it is best to overcall only on shapely hands (especially over a
strong NT). Since you are already at the two level, you really need something more sophisticated 
than simple natural overcalls in order to show two suited hands. 
(There are numerous different defences to 1NT around)

The overcall promises either a one-suited or a two-suited holding, 
with values not exceeding 15 points. 
Importance must be given to the state of vulnerability and the location of the values, 
which should be in the suit or suits promised or indicated.

Although it is a matter of partnership agreement, 
the one-suited holding should contain at least a 6+ card suit, 
and for a two-suited holding the distribution should be at least 5-5. 
Some advocates have reduced the distribution to 5-4 if the values are located only in the two suits 
such as: KQJ10 and AQ1087. 
Some very aggressive players will even decide to overcall with a 4-4 distribution, 
but only in the Major suits. 
This is purely a matter of partnership understanding.

The object of the interference is not to get to game, but rather trying to obstruct the opponents 
and to do so safely. You hate it when they bid over your 1NT — turn the tables and do it to them!

After a NT opening, the bids of the overcaller (also referred to as the Intervenor - partner is called the Advancer) 
are as follows:|

                ^e2NT              ^jShows both Minor suits (5-5)

                ^eDouble           ^jIf the Intervenor has not previously passed, then any double is for penalty.
                                  ^jDouble shows a good hand, either a very strong balanced hand 
^jor (better) a hand with a running suit that can be used to defeat 1NT.                                  
^jPartner must pass.

Cappelletti is unwavering in his view that double needs to be defined as value showing and penalty oriented.
"You need the penalty double. These fancy systems are giving up too much. 
If you have a balanced 16 or 17 points and they open 1NT in front of you, double is best in the long run. 
It's like Blackjack: when dealer has 10, but you have 11, you should double down. 
On a particular hand it might not work, but in the long run it's best. 
Remember that you're over the 1NT opener and that you get to make the opening lead."
According to Cappelletti, whatever the range of the opponents' 1NT, double should show a good 14+

Each overcall generally promises fewer than 15 high card points. 
All overcalls at the ^*Bthree-level^*N are ^*bnatural^*N, weak and pre-emptive.|

@cK7      ^f2@h        ^k@cKJ8    ^oDouble


Partner doubles – penalties.
Dbl should be passed unless responder has a very weak hand (4- points), in which case he should attempt to bail out by bidding a 5 card suit. With a very flat weak hand it is usually best to pass; partner may just have 1NT set in his own hand, and even if 1NT doubled makes it is usually not a total disaster (it is not a game contract).
Note that the double should have an upper limit of about 18-19 points. Now it would be nice to defend 1NT doubled when you have a huge hand but partner is very likely to have less than 5 points and will pull it!

^*bAdvancer and Continuances:^*n

The Advancer has several options, not forgetting that the 1NT bidder generally sits to his left with a defined strength and distribution.
Responses after Intervenor has overcalled with 2@c showing a one-suited holding: 
  2@c is usually a major suit. If you have a decent minor suit, it will often pay to defend 1NT – especially if you are on lead with a suit that is good to lead from. Also, if your suit is @c’s, then you have to play at the 3 level so it is usually best to defend. Thus this 2@c is usually (but not always) a major suit. 
Anyway, responder usually simply relays with 2@d and the Cappelletti bidder will pass if @d’s is his suit 
or else correct to his suit.


(1NT)  ^e^*U2@c^*N^g(p) ^jPass ^mwith at least a 6-card @c

^j2@d   ^mRelay bid, allowing his partner to pass or bid his suit. 
^mIf the suit is @d's, then the Intervenor passes. 
^m- However, if the Intervenor holds a 6-card @c + a 4-card @d, 
^mthen the Intervenor rebids 2NT.

^j2@h  ^mThis bid shows a 5-card @h-suit and also weak values.

^j2@s  ^mThis bid shows a 5-card @s-suit and also weak values.

^j2NT  ^mPromises 11 plus HCP and support for all four suits. 
^mPartner is invited to bid game with a maximum.|

If the Intervenor has ^*bpreviously passed^*N, then a ^*bDBL^*N by the Intervenor cannot be for penalty. 
In this case the double promises either 
- a one-suited holding in @c's or 
- a two-suited holding in the red suits @d + @h 
The Advancer relays with a bid a 2@c, which the Intervenor passes if @c's is the suit.

1. If the Intervenor has a two-suited holding in @d and @h, then the Intervenor bids 2@d after the 2@c relay.
The 2@d rebid promises good support in both red suits. 
The Advancer must then determine whether the contract should be in @d or @h. 
With better @d's the Advancer should pass since game in a Minor suit is not an option opposite a 1NT 
opening by the opponents. 
With better @h's the Advancer will correct to @h and the Intervenor will most likely pass 
since the Intervenor has previously passed.

2. If the Intervenor rebids 2@h after the 2@c relay, then the Intervenor promises @h's and @c's as a two-suited holding, whereby the @h suit is generally the stronger, normally longer suit. 
The advancer either passes or corrects to @c's since the Minor suit is always the @c suit. 

3. If the Intervenor rebids 2@s after the 2@c relay, then the Intervenor promises @s's and @c's as a two-suited holding, whereby the @s suit is generally the stronger, normally longer suit. 
The Advancer either passes or corrects to @c since the Minor suit is always the @c suit. |

Note: Regarding the inclusion of the pre-condition that a rebid by the Intervenor of either Major suit shows that suit and only the Club suit as the second suit is from the original version as set forth by Mr. Michael Cappelletti. 
However, this pre-condition has been revised over time, even by the developer himself, and the consensus is that the rebid of the Intervenor of a Major suit shows that suit and either of the Minor suits.

Note: The general consensus is also that the Advancer, once the Intervenor has defined the two-suited holding, passes with values ranging from zero to about 6/7 high card points. If the established fit is a Minor suit, then the Advancer will not seek game or even raise partner opposite a NT opening by the opponents. 
However, if the partnership has established a Major suit fit, then the Advancer may raise generally 
with a good 8 to 11 points. 
These conditions are, as always, a matter of partnership agreement.

Note: Both the Intervenor and the Advancer must agree as to the length and strength of the one-suited holding 
and/or the two-suited holding generally in relation to the state of vulnerability. 
The decision to compete in this manner should depend on the responder of the NT bidder remaining silent, 
and be based on a relatively sound valuation method and/or trick-taking ability of the holding(s).

In the case that the auction proceeds as follows: 
1NT - 2@c - Ddl, a Redouble shows 7 or more high card points and support in all suits, 
and invites his partner to compete on the three level.

As already mentioned, the Cappelletti conventional method can be used as either a direct overcall or in the pass-out seat. 

The conventional method can also be used after the opponents have opened a 2NT or even a 3NT. 
The conventional method can also be used over a Gambling 2NT or a Gambling 3NT. 
The conventional method can also be used if your partner has opened the auction and an opponent overcalls with 1NT.|

See also: Modified Cappelletti, which is a variation of the concept.

During an interview (Daily Bulletin, Tuesday, March 13, 2007,Volume 50, Number 5, 50th Spring North American Bridge Championship) Mr Cappelletti was asked:

What about the "modified" Cappelletti convention?

"I can't stand it. Using 2@c to show several possible hand types is inferior to just showing your
major-minor two-suiters with 2@h or 2@s. 
The problem with using 2@c as first step in modified Cappelletti is that the opponents compete over 2@c, 
your side could wind up losing the major."

According to Cappelletti, whatever the range of the opponents' 1NT, double should show a good 14+.
On weak NT, he said:

 "If you don't double, but defeat 1NT by one or two tricks (plus 50 or 100), 
you get an inferior score at matchpoints or IMPs if you could have made 1NT yourself 
(for plus 90 or plus 120)
"Also, it's important to compete against the weak NT (with appropriate values). If you can
show both majors, you're at a terrific advantage since your partner will have a good idea of what
to do. 
I've run many, many computer simulations that show it's right to compete with the majors
even if you're only 4-4 with hands as light as 10 or 11 high-card points.

^*bKnow what you’re playing:^*N

If you and your partner agree to play Cappelletti, you may wish to discuss it in more detail.
We are trying to interfere with the opponents. 
What do we do if they turn the tables and they interfere with us?
Here’s an example: 

Partner bids 2@c over 1NT and your right-hand opponent bids 2@d. 
- What is a double by you? 
Does that mean you can set them, or does it ask partner to name her suit? 
- What is 2@h by you? 
Is that pass or correct or does it show hearts?
- If partner doubles 1NT and I have a weak hand, what should I do?

These are some examples of situations that merit further discussion.|

^*bMEL’s Rule:^*N

Sometimes it hard to tell if it is right to bid or not using Cappelletti. 
Mel’s rule of 8 is to help. Like with any rule, judgment is still important. 
Total number of cards in our 2 longest suits minus the total number of losers in your hand is ^*U2+^*N
=> bid.
Need at least 8 points in the 2 suits.

Losing tricks: Count losers only in the first 3 cards of each suit 
( the 4th., 5th., etc. cards in a suit are winners)
With 3 or more cards in a suit the Ace, K, Q are winners, anything lower are losers.
With 2 cards in a suit, Ace or King are winners, anything lower is a loser.
With 1 card in a suit, Ace is a winner.
There are never more than 3 losers in a suit

Example

No 1 ^fNo 2
@sK 5 3 ^f@sK J 6 5 4 
@hA Q 8 7 4 ^f@hK J 6 5 3 
@dK 7 2 ^f@d8 6 
@c9 3 ^f@c5

Hand 1 = 8 cards in 2 longest suits but 7 losers ( 8-7 = 1 ) = pass 
Hand 2 = 10 cards in 2 longest suits and 7 losers (10-7 = 3) = bid

pc|ck|at|If the Intervenor has not previously passed, then any double is for penalty.
Partner must pass.

Cappelletti is unwavering in his view that double needs to be defined as value showing and penalty oriented.
"You need the penalty double. These fancy systems are giving up too much. 
If you have a balanced 16 or 17 points and they open 1NT in front of you, 
double is best in the long run.|

On a particular hand it might not work, but in the long run it's best. 
Remember that you're over the 1NT opener and that you get to make the opening lead."

According to Cappelletti, whatever the range of the opponents' 1NT, double should show a good 14+

mn|final notes and Defense against their Cappelletti|
tu||
cp|2|fp|1|at|^b@2
Some final notes:    

Cappelletti or Multi Landy? 

Partner bids 2@d - the Major suits.

Over 2@d, responder normally bids his best major. 
If he is equal length in the majors it is a lottery as responder must choose a major and you can easily end up playing in a 4-3 fit when there is a 5-3 fit in the other major. 
There is no solution to this guess unless you insist upon 2@d being 5-5 in the majors. 
The best solution is to play Multi-Landy.

Hand 1    ^eHand 2      ^hHand 3         ^kPartner has overcalled 2@d: -
	                             ^kWith hand 1 we simply bid 2@s.
@s9854   ^e@sJ74       ^h@sJ7        ^kWith hand 2 we have to ‘pick’ a major as we may well 
@hQ43	 ^e@hQ43        ^h@hQ4         ^kend up in a 4-3 fit.  
@d64	 ^e@dA764       ^h@dA7642       ^kAnd with hand 3 it would be disastrous to pick the wrong
@cJ62	 ^e@cJ64        ^h@cJ642          ^kone and end up in a 4-2 fit.
	


Multi Landy has the (very big) advantage that you always find the best major suit fit. 
Cappelletti has the advantage that you can play in 2@d (as opposed to 3@d) with a single suited @d hand 
if you prefer not to defend 1NT.

Many players like DONT because it offers the easiest way to get into the auction. 
However, DONT does sacrifice the possibility of doubling their 1NT for a penalty.
Cappelletti, on the other hand, is less efficient in getting our side’s suits (or suit) into the auction, 
but at least it does retain the penalty option. 

Up to you.|

- Don’t double unless you have a good lead to make. 
Avoid the 15- or 16-count hands, riddled with tenaces, 
and from which any long-suit lead is likely to blow a trick.

- If you are in the balancing seat (and not a passed hand), play the same methods,
it makes life so much simpler.

- If you are a passed hand, then the Double can usefully be employed to show a Club one-suiter
(or a 2-suited holding in the red suits)

^*BDefense to Cappelletti:^*N|fp|1|at|^b@2
We open 1NT, they make a Cappelletti bid, here’s what we do against their various bids:

They double: If you already have a runout system then feel free to use it. 
Otherwise, we suggest that you simply play “systems on”, including Stayman and Jacoby Transfers, 
with a Redouble showing a good hand (in other words, good enough to say “I think their Double was a mistake”)

They bid 2@c: Again the easy approach is to play “systems on” with Double as Stayman.

They bid 2@d: You could play Double as showing Diamonds, but a more common approach is 
for this to say “I can double at least one of their suits”, 
encouraging Partner to double with a suitable hand.

They bid 2@h or 2@s: A penalty double. Other bids can be in the Lebensohl-style.

They bid 2NT: Double says “I will double at least one of their minor suits”, 
thereby inviting Opener to the party if he has a suitable doubling hand. 
What about 3@c or 3@d in this situation? 
Clearly not natural, so how about “3@c is game-invitational Stayman”, and “3@d is game-forcing Stayman”?

They preempt with 3 of a suit: The easy solution is that Doubles are penalty and new suits are forcing, 
but some prefer that the Double be take-out. Take your pick.|

^*BModified Cappelletti:^*N|fp|1|at|^b@2

Perhaps the major defect of Cappelletti is that it prevents us from bidding a direct 2@h or 2@s naturally. 
With a major one-suiter we have to bid 2@c first, 
and that gives the opponents more space in which to maneuver. 

Bidding 2@h or 2@s naturally and immediately is more preemptive. 
With that in mind, here is Modified Cappelletti:

Double: ^dGood hand, as before
2@c     ^dEither a Diamond one-suiter or a major-minor two-suiter
2@d     ^dBoth majors, as before
2@h    ^dHeart one-suiter
2@s     ^dSpade one-suiter
2NT    ^dMinors, as before
