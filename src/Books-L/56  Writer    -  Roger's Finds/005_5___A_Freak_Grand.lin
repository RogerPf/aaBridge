This is a freak hand that I picked up in normal play.   I played it just a couple of weeks ago.


My partner (a local  face-to-face  partner, but this was on-line)  can make some strange bids at times.

For example, just because he promises a     LONG SOLID SUIT  
^o does not necessarily mean he has the Ace !

n#|5|
at|^^So it all comes down to how to  BEST  play the @d suit for  ZERO losers.    
If they are  6-0  you can expect a ruff.     
If they are  5-1  you are still likely to get ruffed on the 2nd round of @d's and if that opp has the @s9|
n#|b| 
at|^t you can't even over ruff.|

at|Think about the  4-2  and  3-3 @d splits ?|
n#|5|at|
This is the CORE of the problem, obvious but only if you pause and THINK.    If one opponent has 4 @d's then you have only 1 possible @d loser.  So you ONLY NEED TO RUFF ONCE.|
n#|7|at|    
Doing this means that you have an 85% chance of making this grand slam      4-2 (49%)  +  3-3 (36%)   =   (85%)|

at|So the  PLAN OF THE PLAY   is now very simple.  
Ruff the first trick.         Two rounds of trumps (leaving 1 still out if we have to)
Lead a top @d (taking out dummy's singleton)   
Ruff a low diamond.       Back to hand with any ruff (and draw the last trump, if one is still out)  -  claim.|

at|^*bPost Script^*n         So how is it that ^*b 3 ^*n declarers managed to go down ?  
They tried to ruff 2 @d's in dummy (and got over ruffed by East's @s9).    Why did they do that ?      I am sure that they did it without really thinking.   They did it because they could !    In effect they played  ^*bFOR^*n  a 5-1 split and so gave themselves a chance to go down if the split was a more normal 4-2.        ^*bMoral^*n  -  think normally.|
at|^^FYI  your  ^*b1510^*n (7@s making) is not the top score, that honor goes to  ^*b1620^*n (6@s redoubled making ONLY 12)  !|
