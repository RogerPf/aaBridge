at|This hand came up last night my fearless partner put us into the correct contract. 

As you will see it was not a hard hand to make so long as you   THINK CLEARLY.


The traveller showed, as usual, a varied story, 
^h 9 of the 16 entries had the hand playing in 5@D's, of which TWO when down.

You are not going to go down are you ?|

at|^^ The lead probably means that the @sK is also on your left so.  So the only way make 3NT is if the @hKQ are also on your left (hard to get East in to lead a @s through you).  But with that barrage bidding in @s's its is unlikely that anyone will try to play there.        That makes 5@d the right contract  @-  now all you have to do is make it.|

at|Taking  North    ^e as the master hand we have  4  losers    0@s   3@h(s)   0@d   1@c(s)    we need to reduce this to  2.
If you are keeping a cool head this is where it gets easy.  There is no clearly way to dump the @c loser, so we have to try and dispose of  2  of the  3 @h losers.  How ?  By ruffing - how else !   Sanity check - they have 6 @h's so they could start ruffing early but thankfully their largest trump is the @h6.|

at|So the play should go -  
Ruff the lead.  Cash @hA.  Lead any @h.  Win the return in dummy.  Ruff another @h (with the @d7 if needed). Cross to dummy with a top @c and ruff another @h.  Cross back to dummy with a trump and ruff the last @h with your @dA (but it will probally have come good).   Concede a @c, claiming the 11.
^c  Try and visualize all those plays  BEFORE  you play them through.   It great practice for the real thing.

If you are wondering how 2 of the 9 managed to go down ?  The answer is that they "shillied & shallied" and did not "know where to roam".    One ruffed a @h and then drew trumps, the other ruffed a @s.   Basicaly they did not have a plan to make their contract and so in the end they did not . . .|
