He thought the hand interesting and had some questions he wanted answered.|
n#|5|at|
^d@.   Assuming there is a squeeze going on, what sort of squeeze is it ?
^d@.   What should declarers plan be to maximize the probability of making the contract ?
^d@.   What evidence should declarer use to form that particular plan ?|

Thoughts please ?|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
at|There are the obvious 11 top tricks 7@h 2@d 2@s.  If the spades are 3-3 or the @sQ and @sJ are anywhere except both with East then there is an easy twelfth.

So already we appear to be looking at a 75% slam. 

And we have not even mentioned the cloud of squeeze possibilities,  eg: South's @dJ menacing the defenders  @dQ.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
at|Realisticly, can we see any reason to not play either the  @s9  or  @s10  from North ? |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|    No,  so lets do it.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


pc|ST|pc|SQ|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


at|^^
I know we do not yet have a full plan.  Should we duck the  @sQ  and let East win this trick ?  It would rectify the count for any future squeeze.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


at|^^
But what if the @s8 is a singleton?   Then the spade return would be ruffed.  It is one thing to go down, quite another to be seen to go down in a silly way!|

qx|Draw,wide|
nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
at|OK, so we can now draw trumps take the finesse against the @sJ and claim our 75% slam.  BUT what if East started with @sQJxx?    After all, the  @s8  is a very strange lead from a holding like @sJ8(x).

Either way we first draw trumps.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
at|So West started with no trumps and so could not choose to lead them.  

West also threw a two Diamonds and one Club or to put it in a more memorable way @-

In the opponents hands there are now  just @-  4 Spades,  5 Diamonds and  9 Clubs.|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|at|Back to West's original lead.   Leading the @s8 makes most sense if led from  @s8x  and fits with West not wanting to lead from say a (single) top high club and the @dQ.

Holding both the @cAK, surely a lead jumps out  (even though North opened with a bid of 1@c).  |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


at|^^
If this analysis is correct then taking the spade finesse now will see us go down.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
at|So what about the squeeze possibilities ?

Assuming West is guarding Clubs and Diamonds (with say the @dQ10x) and East is guarding Clubs and Spades then a double squeeze would fail because ... North plays before East so no pressure in Spades on East.

So, no double squeeze and anyway we have not yet rectified the count.|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
at|If West did start with 4 spades then they  would / could?  be vulnerable to a thrown in.

Let's try to imagine East's exit cards.   Of East's remaining 9 cards three would be spades and 6 cards remaining in the minors, probably including a top Club.|

At|^^
Given we appear to have three unneeded cards in North let's delay the second @s finesse and take another three rounds of trumps.  While, of course, watching what is thrown.|

at|So far not a single diamond from East and no sign of that high Club, which we presume East started with.  It is now decision time.  But we have seen a total of 3 Diamonds and 3 Clubs thrown by West and three Clubs thrown by East.

The defenders are down to 4 Spades, 4 Diamonds and 4 Clubs between them.      Now is crunch time

Do we play for the finesse or the strip and throw-in ?|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


qx|Ans,wide|
nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
at|^*bAnswer:^*n    We go with the @s8 spades being a strange lead.

And implying that West started with the @dQ and so has kept 2 other Diamonds to guard that Queen.   So we put East's last five cards as being @-  3 @s's, the remaining @d and 2@c's (one a high honour).

As we need the Heart for entry and control purposes we now start with the two top Diamonds.|

at|Well  -  So as predicted, West started with only 1 diamond.  

Let's see which top club they have.|

Interesting.   If we are correct (and East has three spades) we can just let this ride and have  ^*bit^*n  be the throw-in card.|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
at|However to prove that this method would work even if the East card was a low club (which West could overtake and so ruin the throw-in by leading a spade) we will ruff the @cA.|

It looks like we can answer Bob's question.  It is not a Squeeze after all it is just a (complex) Strip and Throw In.|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |

at|But don't get complacent, East had one other choice.     We need to wind back three tricks. |

pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
at|The answer is simple (ish).

East must be thrown in  ^*bnow^*n  while the remaining trump (@h8) gives you control of the Club suit.

You also need to lead the @s9 (not the @s6),  incase East has the @s5 and West the @S7.|
