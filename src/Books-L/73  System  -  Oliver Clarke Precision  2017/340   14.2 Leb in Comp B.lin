cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Hi Everyone and welcome to today's session, in which we'll be continuing our look at Defensive / Competitive Bidding.

Last time we took an initial look at Lebensohl in Competition.

Today we're going to really drive that point home by mainly practising bidding competitive hands.

Let me stress that this is not a part of Precision (no aspect of defensive bidding really belongs to one system or another) and does not really affect any other part of the system.

Similarly, you can happily use (or not use) these methods WHATEVER system you are playing.

If you have not already done so, please have a look at the notes I have prepared on tonight's topic.

You can find these on: ^*h http://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/index.php ^*n 

The section on Defensive Bidding can be accessed from there ^*h http://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/Defensive.php ^*n


First a quick recap on what we covered last week. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


--------------------------------------------------------------------
nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
lg|b|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Lebensohl in Competition works in much the same way as Lebensohl over a 1NT Opening, but with a few different nuances caused by the fact that at least one of us has bid a SUIT already.
|n^|5|at|
^b   ^*b 1.  @2^*nLeb in Competition applies in any NATURAL competitive sequence where both sides are bidding and we've reached the 2-level and when 2NT would otherwise be available as a natural raise.

^b   ^*b 2.  ^*nGenerally Leb in Competition does not apply when 2NT would already have an artificial meaning (eg: Romex, Jacoby 2NT, etc).  That situation is very fluid, however, and even though Leb in Competition might NOT apply at one particular point in an auction, it can STILL apply a moment later when another bid has been made.

^b   ^*b 3.  ^*nGenerally, FAST new suits at the 3-level are MORE ENCOURAGING (in fact they are normally forcing)  and tend to imply at least a decent tolerance for partner's suit.

^b   ^*b 4.  ^*nSLOW new suits tend to imply the lack of a decent tolerance for partner's suit and are less encouraging.

^b   ^*b 5.  ^*nDirect suit raises are always pre-emptive and non-forcing.
When our suit is higher-ranking than theirs, a SLOW raise to the 3-level is genuinely invitational, but when their suit is higher-ranking, the FAST raise to the 3-level is more encouraging than a SLOW one.

^b   ^*b 6.  ^*nCue-bids of Opps suit (not when it's an Unassuming Cue-Bid) are a game-forcing raise in Partner's suit.
A FAST cue-bid of Opps suit DENIES 1st or 2nd-round Control of Opps Suit, and a SLOW cue-bid of their suit promises 1st or 2nd-round control of the suit.

^b   ^*b 7.  ^*nSLOW and FAST bids of 3NT have the same implications as after:     1NT   -   (2x)   -   ???

^b   ^*b 8.  ^*nLeb in Competition doesn't prevent you from using other devices, such as Unassuming Cue-Bids, Negative, Competitive and Support Doubles, etc.

^b@2Okay, that's a very brief recap of what we covered last week.

Any questions thus far ?|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


--------------------------------------------------------------------
nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
lg|a|
at|^*blute57:^*n  Could you review the Leb case where one is interested in raising one's OWN SUIT instead of partner's.
|n^|3|at|
|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Well essentially the same principles apply:  A FAST return to your own suit is generally more encouraging if Opps' suit is higher-ranking than yours, 
|n^|3|at|
but if your suit is higher-ranking than Opps', then the SLOW return to your suit is genuinely invitational and the fast raise more pre-emptive.
|n^|3|at|
But it really does depend on the exact sequence, and what action partner has taken to date.
|n^|3|at|
^*blute57:^*n     1@h   -   (2@c)   -   2@d   -   (p)   -    3@h       for example
|n^|3|at|
|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Here, Hearts are higher-ranking than any other suit that's been bid so over partner's 2@d (which itself in only COMPETITIVE, because we were in a Lebensohl situation over Opps' 2@c bid).
|n^|3|at|
A SLOW 3@h would be a genuine invitation (Max with 6-card hearts, eg a hand worth a jump rebid).
|n^|3|at|
Similarly the FAST 3@h is showing long Hearts (possibly 7+-card), but not necessarily maximum in terms of HCP.
|n^|3|at|
At the same time, though, the fast 3@h can also suggest a reasonably good tolerance or support for Partner's Diamonds, whereas, the SLOW 3@h would suggest no great interest in Diamonds.
|n^|3|at|
Once again, you can decide as a partnership how to mesh these considerations together, ie: whether the difference between SLOW and FAST in those sequences is more to do with invitation/pre-emptive or to do with support for partner's suit.
|n^|3|at|
^*bMajor_Blue:^*n  And an immediate bid of 2@h in this example would be very weak ?.
|n^|3|at|
|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Yes, merely suggesting 6-card Hearts, lower range.
|n^|3|at|
It doesn't really say much about support for Diamonds but it's likely that Opener will NOT have good support foir Diamonds, because 2@d from Partner wasn't forcing (competitive), and so with a minimum hand and Diamond support, Opener could pass.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


--------------------------------------------------------------------
nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
lg|c|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Let's look at a typical sequence where Lebensohl is in use in this way:  
South opens 1@s, West overcalls 2@c, North bids 2@h and East passes.       
|n^|5|at|
^d 1@s    -   (2@c)   -   2@h   -   (p)   -    ???  
|n^|5|at|
Here we are in a competitive sequence and the bidding has reached the 2-level.  South is next to bid and they have a number of options 

^b   ^*b 1.  @2^*nIf South bids 2@s here this is simply competitive, showing no additional values.
|n^|8|at|
^d 1@s    -   (2@c)   -   2@h   -   (p)   -    2@s

^b   ^*b 2.  @2^*nIf South bids a fast 3@s then this is strong and encouraging 
|n^|8|at|
^d 1@s    -   (2@c)   -   2@h   -   (p)   -    3@s
|n^|8|at|
but if the opening is limited to 15 HCP (as in Precision), it is unlikely to be game-forcing, especially bearing in mind that North's  2@h  is also in a Leb situation, and so mainly competitive 

|n^|8|at|
^b   ^*b 3.  @2^*nIf South bids 2NT, then this tells North to bid 3@c after which South can make an invitational bid in either Hearts or Spades.   So here, it's a similar situation to that you outlined, John.
^d 1@s   -   (2@c)   -   2@h   -   (p)   -    2NT(Leb)   -   (p)   -    3@c(forced)   -   (p)   -    3@h/3@s   
^b@2
^*blute57: ^*n would the fast 3@s be stronger than the slow 3@s there?

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   FAST 3@s is strongish and pre-emptive, but suggesting a decent tolerance, for Hearts (but less than full support), whereas the SLOW 3@s is genuinely invitational in Spades, but suggesting NOT good tolerance for Hearts.

Don't forget, Opener will never have good Heart support for this sequence unless they make a slow or fast raise in Hearts or a slow or fast cue-bid of Opps' Clubs.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


--------------------------------------------------------------------
nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|lg|c|
^*bkritter2:^*n  then fast shows values in partners suit and slow shows little tolerance ?

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Yes.    Worth noting here that OUR suits are both HIGHER-RANKING than Opps suit.   This means we can bid COMPETITIVELY at the same level.

That in turn means that a SLOW bid in either of our suits at the NEXT level (ie: the 3-level after ...2NT-3@c) is invitational.

If South's Opening was a 2/1 or SAYC Opening, then a fast 3@s over 2@h probably would be forcing.

It's also worth noting that Partner's 2@h was only competitive, so not forcing (because they were also in a Leb situation over Opps' 2@c

If Opps suit is HIGHER-RANKING than ours, this this changes the sense of SLOW and FAST bids in our suit(s).

Now a SLOW bid in our suit is competitive and less encouraging, and the FAST bid is more encouraging.

The other thing to notice here is that NORTH is also in a position to use Lebensohl over the overcall of 2@c, so their initial 2@h bid is merely competitive.

If North bids, I think this is where the confusion comes in;)) 2NT over 2@c then this is ALSO Lebensohl forcing 3@c from South and now North could make an invitational bid in Hearts or Spades.

Similarly a "fast" 3@h bid would be strong and forcing in nature.

We can have a number of Lebensohl situations in the same sequence 

^*bmaysie:^*n    What  then  is        1@S   -   (2@C)   -   3@S     ? 

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   purely pre-emptive.                 Hopefully you are beginning to get the picture.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


--------------------------------------------------------------------
nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
lg|c|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Let's try another:   South Opens 1@d, West bids 1@h, North bids 1@s and East supports with 2@h 
|n^|7|at|
^d 1@d    -   (1@h)   -   1@s   -   (2@h)   -    ???  

^b   ^*b 1.  @2^*nA fast bid of 3@d is strong and encouraging, and implies a reasonable partial fit for Spades, whereas

^b   ^*b 2.  ^*nA "slow" bid of 3@d is less encouraging, showing long Diamonds but a weakish hand and no good fit for Spades 

^b   ^*b 3.  @2^*n2@s would be just competitive, probably a weaker hand but with decent Spade support

^b   ^*b 4.  ^*nA "slow" bid of 3@s is genuinely invitational and a "fast" bid of 3@s is pre-emptive
 
^b   ^*b 5.  ^*nIf South bids a FAST 3NT, then this shows a strong hand, presumably with long running Diamonds, but no good Heart stop.

^b   ^*b 6.  ^*nA "slow" bid of 3NT, however, also shows a strong hand, but now PROMISES decent Heart values as well.

^b   ^*b 7.  ^*nSuppose the bidding starts 
^d 1@d   -   (1@h)   -   1@s   -   (2@h)
^d 2@s   -     (p)    -   3@h
Here the 3@h bid shows a game-forcing raise in Spades (which we've agreed), but DENYING 1st or 2nd round control of Hearts.
^b@2
A SLOW cue-bid of Hearts in this situation would be similar, but PROMISING 1st or 2nd round control of Hearts and thereby slam invitational.

So although the game-forcing cue-bids normally apply when we want to agree PARTNER's suit, we can also use them once partner has agreed OUR suit Ok, I think that's enough example hands.

^b@2
^*bPajac_99:^*n  what would X mean?

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   I would take Double by South to be a Support Double, showing exactly 3-card support for Spades|

lg|c|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Let's practice some hands.

I'd prefer people to sit as PAIRS having agreed what system to play already.

It doesn't have to be Precision, but that way we avoid lots of discussion to start with.

Unless we find an interesting play hand, I'd prefer just to  bid the hands, and then lead and claim.

Don't forget that these hands rely on competitive bidding, so don't be slow to compete :)

at|  Here the SLOW 3@s from West, is genuinely invitational.  West ^*b could ^*n also make a UCB (Unassuming Cue Bid) bid of 3@H showing support for partners spades and a Game Force.  The partnership has to agree which is the stronger investigation.  Myself, I'd make the UCB stronger than the SLOW 3@s.
|n#|5|at|UCB's take precedence over the GF cue-bids,  so 3@h from West would be a UCB rather than GF in @s without a @h control.   On the other hand, if West bid a SLOW 3@h, I would take that as GF in @s WITH a @h control because the SLOW 3@h cannot be confused with a UCB.|

Over the 1@s overcall we're not strictly in a Lebensohl situation (not at the 2-level yet), so a new suit at the 2-level by South would carry the same meaning as it would without the interference, so forcing (ostensibly to 2NT).

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  I could just have blasted 4@s earlier (instead of 2NT), but I wanted partner to know I have an absolute rock-crushing hand.
So this (3@d) is game-forcing in Partner's Spades and PROMISING control of Diamonds.|

^*bManso21: ^*n zero (nothing)
^*bmaysie: ^*n no Control Cues in other suits.
|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   The point is that 3@s is STRONGER than 4@s  (principle of fast arrival).
It certainly suggests no Control of Clubs or Hearts, though, since East could have cue-bid either of those suits below game level.|

at|   East needs to be a little careful here. I know she has no first round control of Hearts or Clubs from her failure to cue one of them instead of 3@s, but at the end of the day she only has a 5-count.   I know East has a Diamond control of some sort, and can be fairly that that if the Kings of either Major are missing, they're likely to be with South because of their opening bid.
In fact, I will be able to place most, if not all the outstanding HCP strength with South.|

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  fair enough John, but your 2@c does promise 12+, so if South has a distributional 2-suiter with good controls, their actions not unreasonable ...especially since, in the play, you will have little or no trouble placing the outstanding HCP strength.  So you can bail out now with 5@c or 6@c.|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  South right to push here, I feel.   
If North's 2@c was based in a @s fit and intending to play in Spades, they'd bid 3@s over 3@h.     Failing that they must have a decent Club suit.     If North is 12+, then little chance of West having ANYTHING,  so easy to play the hand with confidence.   
^^Any questions or comments?|

Please don't worry if some of this is still a little murky. This is a pretty complex
gadget to take on board and it can take a while before you really get your head.


hossam1996:  thanks oliver :) 

RaNTuL:  okay.... Ty so much Oliver for your  efforts to teach us  prec your style. appreciated.
