cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Hi Everyone and welcome to today's Precision Club session, in which we'll be taking a close look at
the 2@D Opening & Responses that we use in this system.


This is  ^*bNOT^*n a standard Precision Opening.


If you have not already done so, please have a look at the notes I have prepared on Precision Club bidding.

You can find these on: ^*hhttp://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/index.php^*n

You might want to have these onscreen in the background for reference during the session.

The notes on 2@D can be found at  ^*hhttp://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/2d.php^*n  



Ok, first a brief introduction to the 2@D Opening...

"Classic" Precision uses the 2@D Opening for  11-15  4414  shape hands  ie. with only a singleton Diamond.

Devoting a bid to a single shape that only comes up one hand in a thousand is a waste of a bid, in my view, which is why I have always preferred to open such hands with 1@D  instead, which in turn frees up the 2@D Opening for something else.

nt||fp|t-title|n#|3|cp|m-mastColor|at|^*b Obsolete - December 2016^*n|cp||fp||ht|a|at|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|2D Opening|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at| There are two 2@D Openings in this system, one for the "Simple" system, which is what I'm going to show you tonight.

The other is for the Complex version of the system, which is essentially a Multi 2@D Opening.

I'll be going through that after this course has finished  That something else is STRONG 16-23 point hands with ANY 4441 distribution.

These don't occur any more frequently than 11-15 4441 hands (probably less), but this is a hand type that is @Dnot@D specifically catered for by the 1@C Opening and always requires special handling, because Opener's suit rebids always show 5+-card suits.

Some Precision pairs overcome this by allowing 4-card suits to be shown by rebids, but I've never been comfortable with this approach and it really would change EVERYTHING else in the system (all the Asking Bids, responses etc).

Most Precision Pairs who abandon the "classic" 2@D Opening either take that route or use 2@D as a Multi, one of the options of which is a strong 4441 hand The 2@D Opening is unconditionally forcing for one round.

It is not unheard of for Responder to pass with a 7-card or longer Diamond suit and a Yarborough, but it is anti-systemic, not to mention masterminding, and you look a bit silly when partner turns out to have 4-card Diamond support and 6@D is cold <grin>.

Because the Opening is forcing, Opener must not forget that there is no guarantee of a decent trump fit anywhere and Responder may be very weak, so almost ALL of the low-level responses and sequences are natural and non- forcing.|

nt||fp|t-title|n#|3|cp|m-mastColor|at|^*b Obsolete - December 2016^*n|cp||fp||ht|a|at|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  @2One thing in passing:    ^*b 24+^*n point  4441  hands ARE still opened with  1@C, because a range bigger than  16-23  would be really difficult to handle.

Opener is now FORCED to rebid in a 4-card suit because they have the strength to handle developments.   This usually means using the DELTA Asking Bid, which we'll see in a few weeks.  


^b@2|fp|t-title|at|2D Opening|fp||at|^^^^|
at|The 2@D Opening shows ANY 4441 hand in the 16-23 point range, wherever the singleton is located.

Opener usually indicates their precise range and where the singleton lies with their next one or two rebids.

The 2@D Opening forces a relay of 2@H from Responder ^*bunless^*n Responder holds one of the following hand-types:
^c@2
2@d -  2@s/3@c/3@d/3@h  ^h0-4  hcp   a 6-card or longer suit   Responder bids it as cheaply as possible (^*bnot^*n 2@h)
2@d -  2NT ^h14+ hcp   at least 4-cards in BOTH Majors
2@d -  3@s ^h14+ hcp   at least 4-cards in Spades and one or both ^*bMinors^*n
2@d -  3NT ^h14+ hcp   at least 4-cards in BOTH ^*bMinors^*n
^b@2
With long Hearts and 0-4 points Responder bids 3@H immediately rather than the 2@H Relay.

The "rescue" bids (2@S, 3@C, 3@D and 3@H) serve as a warning to Opener, especially if Responder has found their singleton suit (in which case they'll usually pass), but Opener may bid on if this has hit a 4-card suit in their hand.

The 2NT, 3@S and 3NT Responses are immediately slam invitational, since we're GUARANTEED a fit somewhere and KNOW we have 30+ HCP between the two hands.  


With ANY holding  ^*bnot shown above^*n, Responder MUST bid 2@H over the 2@D Opening.|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt||fp|t-title|n#|3|cp|m-mastColor|at|^*b Obsolete - December 2016^*n|cp||fp||ht|a|at|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|2D Opening|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|    The 2@H Relay says nothing about anything, particularly Hearts, and MUST be alerted. It's a Relay, pure and simple  

^c 2@D - 2@H               ^h is the Relay
^c 2@D - 2@S/3@C/3@D/3@H   ^h are the long weak suits, and  2@D - 2NT/3@S/3NT  are slam invitational.

Most of the time, Responder bids the 2@H Relay.

So the full scheme of initial responses to the 2@D Opening is as follows:- 
^c@2
2@D - 2@H ^f Forced Relay     (with most responder hands)
2@D - 2@S ^f 0-4 ^g hcp   6-card or longer @SSpades@S
2@D - 2NT ^f 14+ ^g hcp   BOTH Majors

2@D - 3@C ^f 0-4 ^g hcp   6-card or longer @CClubs@C
2@D - 3@D ^f 0-4 ^g hcp   6-card or longer @DDiamonds@D
2@D - 3@H ^f 0-4 ^g hcp   6-card or longer @HHearts@H
2@D - 3@S ^f 14+ ^g hcp   Spades and at least 1 Minor

2@D - 3NT ^f 14+ ^g hcp   Both Minors

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Well I would suggest that ANYTHING other than Pass or a game bid in responder's suit should be treated as a game try.  In Responder's suit of course, since you have no time to explore for an alternative fit and responder's hand will almost certainly be completely valueless if the hand is played in any other denomination.|

nt||fp|t-title|n#|3|cp|m-mastColor|at|^*b Obsolete - December 2016^*n|cp||fp||ht|a|at|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  As we have just seen, in the case of the long weak suit variety of response, Opener generally passes unless maximum a fit for Responder's suit (bearing in mind that Responder might have a yarborough).

In any event all continuations are natural and non-forcing (invitational, at best).

Any questions on the rescue responses before we move onto  2@D - 2@H  in a little more detail? ok

^^^^|fp|t-title|at|2@D - 2@H  Relay|fp||at|^^
When Responder makes the 2@H relay, then Opener rebids as follows:  

^c2@D - 2@H - 2@S  ^g16-19  hcp  and ANY 4441 distribution.

Responder makes a further automatic relay of 2NT and now Opener bids the suit / bid  ^*bBELOW^*n  the singleton, (including 2NT).

All continuations are natural and "to play" except a bid in the singleton suit which is the Beta Asking Bid or an Ace-Ask, depending on your methods.
^c@2
2@D - 2@H - 2NT  ^g 20-23  hcp   4441   CLUB  ^nsingleton
2@D - 2@H - 3@C  ^g 20-23  hcp   4414   DIAMOND  ^nsingleton
2@D - 2@H - 3@D  ^g 20-23  hcp   4144   HEART  ^nsingleton
2@D - 2@H - 3@H  ^g 20-23  hcp   1444   SPADE  ^nsingleton 
^b@2
Over these Rebids, All continuations are strictly natural except a bid in the singleton suit which is Beta or an Ace-Ask.|

nt||fp|t-title|n#|3|cp|m-mastColor|at|^*b Obsolete - December 2016^*n|cp||fp||ht|a|at|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|2@d  -  2@h       Main Sequence|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  So these are the mainstream sequences: 

^c2@D - 2@h - 2@s - 2NT -     3@c/3@d/3@h/3@s 
    
90% of the time Responder bids 2@H and Opener either bids 2@S (16-19, and now Responder bids 2NT Relay and Opener now bids the suit  ^*bBELOW^*n  their singleton). 

^*bOR^*n

^c2@D - 2@h -     ^h 2NT/3@c/3@d/3@h/3@s

Opener rebids at 2NT and upwards (20-23 and  ^*bimmediately showing the suit BELOW^*n  their Singleton).

Once Opener has shown their distribution and strength, responder is absolutely and utterly the Captain of the Hand ANYTHING they bid, unless it is an Ace-Ask/Beta in the Singleton suit, or obviously invitational, is a sign-off.   So

^c2@D  -  2@H(Relay)  -  2@S(16-19)  -  2NT(Relay)  -  3@C  -  3@H ^q then the 3@h is a sign-off.

^c2@D  -  2@H(Relay)  -  2@S(16-19)  -  2NT(Relay)  -  3@C  -  4@C ^q is obviously invitational in Clubs

but Opener MUST accept any decision responder makes about there the hand is to be played.

at|   Opener here might think that 4@S may have chances (and they'd be right), but they MUST accept responder's decision.

These are the sequences where Opener must remember that only a 4-3 fit may be available here and Responder has promised no values whatsoever, so even if a maximum 23-count, Opener should respect a sign-off in one of their 4-card suits by Responder.|

bt||
nt||fp|t-title|n#|3|cp|m-mastColor|at|^*b Obsolete - December 2016^*n|cp||fp||ht|a|at|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Remember, you are NOT guaranteed a 4-4 card fit ANYWHERE.

So you might be playing in a 4-3 fit opposite a yarborough.

It might seem odd that we have no provision for Trump Asking Bids in these sequences, but bear in mind that Responder may have NO points and NO 4+-card fit for any of Opener's 4-card suits and we are already likely to be at the 3-level, so priority has to be given to giving Responder an exit route.

If Responder has points and a known fit, they do have some options open to them to explore for slam, but it has to be fairly basic and take 2nd place to finding a safe resting spot when Responder has nothing.

That's the "simple" sequences taken care of.


Most of the rest of this session tends to anticipate the Asking Bids, so we'll be coming back to the rest of the 2@D Opening in a couple of months when we've gone through all the Asking Bids (ie: When we've covered Eta).
^^
|fp|t-title|at|2@d  -  2NT      Response|fp||at|^^^^|
at|So now we will cover, how to handle the 14+ hands when Asking Bids are ^*bNOT^*n in use.  As stated much earlier, the sequence   2@d - 2NT   shows a responder hand with 14+ hcp and BOTH Majors.

This guarantees a combined 30+ and assures at least an 8-card fit, so slam values have been established, so Opener can bid a 4-card Major to set the trump suit (Eta Ask if Asking Bids in use or inviting cue-bids if not).

Directly bidding the major in this way indicates a singleton in the OTHER Major.


Let's see an example|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Alternatively, with 4-cards in BOTH Majors, Opener rebids: 

^c 3@C  with a  Diamond  Singleton 
^c 3@D  with a  Club        Singleton

thereby allowing Responder to show their preferred major.

Bear in mind that Responder has promised at least 4-4 in the Majors but might be 6-4.

The bid Responder uses to set the trump suit is Eta (if Asking Bids are in use) or an inviting cue-bid (if they are not).

So with both Majors, Opener bids the MINOR they DO have and now Responder chooses which Major to play in.

With any of the sequences over  2@D - 2NT  a bid of Opener's declared (or implied_ singleton suit is either Beta or an Ace-Ask unless a suit has specifically been agreed in which case 4NT can be used if cheaper (and if Asking Bids are not in use).  So

^c2@D   -   2NT(14+ Majors)   -   3@C(@D singleton)   -   3@S(Sets @S)   -   4@D      is RKCB 0314.

A Bid in Opener's Known short suit by either   Responder  OR  Opener    is RKCB.

This all changes once Asking Bids are in use, but we'll come to that later in the series

fp|t-title|at|2@d  -  3@s       Response|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  The 3@S response shows 14+ with specifically Spades and at least one minor.

As with the 2NT and 3NT responses, this assures us of slam values and a 4-card fit somewhere.

In the case of the 3@S Response, Opener rebids 3NT with a Spade Singleton.

This asks responder to show their minor (make an Eta Ask in their Minor if Asking Bids are in use) ^*BOR^*n  to set the suit otherwise.   So

^c   2@D - 3@S - 3NT         shows a singleton @S.

ANYTHING else agrees Spades as trumps.  Over   2@D - 3@S - 3NT   Opener simply chooses which Minor and now we start cue-bidding or using RKCB in @S

^^^^|fp|t-title|at|2@d  -  3NT       Response|fp||at|^^^^|
at|As stated earlier, the 3NT response shows 14+ with BOTH Minors.

This guarantees a combined 30+ and assures at least an 8-card fit, so slam values have been established, so Opener bids one or other Minor at the 4-level to set the suit (or ask as Gamma).

If Asking Bids are in use then a non-trump relay over the Eta response is Beta, but 4NT can be used as RKCB if Asking Bids are not being used.

fp|t-title|at|Interference  immediately  over  2@d|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  So what do we do in the event of interference? Firstly, let's look when Opps intervene immediately over the 2@D Opening.

^c(1) ^dw@2ith any hand that would normally make the 2@H Relay or one of the long-weak-suit responses, Responder simply ^*bpasses^*n (but see below).

^c(2) ^dwith a 14+ 2-suited hand that would normally have bid  2NT, 3@S or 3NT,  Responder ^*bDoubles^*n.

^c(3) ^dw@2ith a LIMITED (0-7) hand with two 4-card suits (NOT Opps suit), Responder bids their CHEAPEST 4-card suit we can afford as we know we'll have a fit somewhere (4-card includes 4+ cards, obviously).  So
^b@2
If Responder PASSES over the interference, Opener will tend to Double if the interference is in their singleton suit (ie: takeout),  ^*bOR^*n  bid their cheapest 4-card suit otherwise.
^b@2
with 20-23 points they might double for takeout even with a 4-card holding in Opps' suit, or might bid the suit below their singleton if it's obvious this is NOT their cheapest 4-card suit (ie: more than 2 steps over the interference). So:

^c2@D  -  (2@H)  -  Pass  -  (Pass)
|n^|8|at|
^c3@C      
|n^|8|at|
is definitely 20-23 HCP with a singleton Diamond, because Opener could have bid 2@S with a 16-19 hand of the same type.

Any questions thus far?|

fp|t-title|at|Interference  immediately  over  2@d     cont |fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  If Responder DOUBLES over the interference (showing 14+) Opener has the option of passing at favourable vulnerability, but will normally bid the suit below their singleton.

Responder now makes an Eta Ask (or sets the suit inviting cue - bids if no Asking Bids in use).    So

^c2@D  -  (2@H)  -  X(14+ 2-suited)  -  3@H(singleton Spade)  -  4@C         the 4@c  sets the suit.

^cOne thin@2g in passing.  It won't have escaped your notice that 2-suited hands with HEARTS and a Minor are not catered for in the scheme I've outlined.  That's just tough.   There's no space to include that hand-type.

HOWEVER - If 2nd-in-hand over the 2@D Opening bids something and Responder HAS a 14+ hand with hearts and a Minor, they can now still Double to show a 14+ 2-suited hand because come what may Opener will bid the suit below their singleton over the double and Responder can now set whichever suit we have a fit in, as trumps.

^b@2If, over the interference, Responder bids a suit (showing 2-suited 0-7), Opener bids naturally, either (if Responder has hit their singleton) bidding the next suit up  ^*bOR^*n  passing with a minimum hand (and a fit)  ^*bOR^*n   raising / bidding game with a fit and a mid/upper range hand.

With a 4-card holding in Opps' suit and no fit, Opener can bid NT's if it's cheaper than bidding the next suit.  So

^c2@D  -  (2@H)  -  2@S(0-7, 2-suited, @S and another)  -  2NT       the 2NT just shows a singleton Spade

now Responder just shows their second suit.  All the bids, once Responder bids a suit, are essentially natural and non-forcing.      However - if Opps Double and Responder passes, Opener redoubles with a singleton in the suit bid  ^*bOR^*n  bids the next suit up, without.

That covers interference over the 2@D Opening.|

fp|t-title|at|Interference  over     2@D  -  2@h(relay)|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Now let's turn our attention to interference over the 2@H Relay (or one of the 14+ Responses).

^c@.   If Responder bid 2@H and Opps Double, a redouble by Opener shows a singleton Heart.

^c@.   Similarly, if Opps bid a suit, a Double by Opener is for takeout, showing a singleton in their suit.

^c@.   In @2one of those situations, If Opener PASSES over the interference, it implies a 4-card holding in Hearts (over a double of 2@H)  OR  a 4-card holding in the suit bid by Opps.

^c@.   with an upper range hand (20-23), Opener can bid their cheapest 4-card suit over Opps' bid, or perhaps even bid 2/3NT with a maximum hand and a 4-card holding in Opps' suit.  (but bear in mind that responder hasn't promised ANYTHING as yet). 
^b@2
If Opener passes over the interference, then a Double by Responder is essentially for takeout, but showing values in the knowledge that Opener probably has a 4-card holding in Opps' suit and may well pass for penalties.

If Responder has shown a long-weak suit variety that has hit Opener's singleton, and Opps interfere, Opener will tend to pass, but can obviously compete or bid game if they have a 4-card fit for Responder's suit.

If Responder has shown one of the 14+ hand-types (2NT, 3@S or 3NT), then Opener bids the cheapest potential (or known) fit, or can bid Opps' suit with a KNOWN double fit   eg:  

^c2@D  -  3@S(@S+Minor)  -  (4@H)  -  ???     now Opener might bid 5@H with a Singleton @H.|

nt||fp|t-title|n#|3|cp|m-mastColor|at|^*b Obsolete - December 2016^*n|cp||fp||ht|a|at|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  If no Asking Bids are in use: 

If Opener has bid a suit Responder is KNOWN to have  ie: after 2@D - 2NT   or   2@D - 3NT,  then cue-bidding ensues.

If Opener has bid a suit Responder MIGHT have  ie: a Minor after 2@D  -  3@S  -  (4x)  -  ???  but in fact has hit a shortage or fragment (ie: NOT a suit), Responder bids Spades or their other Minor, whichever is the cheapest.

If Asking Bids ARE in use, then this is Gamma (4-card min length).

If this is a suit Responder MIGHT have, the responses have an extra first step to show no 4-card holding.

Any questions on interference? That's it for the 2@D Opening.

It's a fairly complex scheme of responses but you can see a very detailed description of the Opening and Responses on the website at

ht|d|at|^^|
cp||at|^*bMM:^*n|cp||at|  We all know we have to alert when playing  'proper'  bridge.

The laws of the game say that what we have to put in the alert is  ^*b our agreement with partner ^*n about that bid.

While creating these bridge movies, I have gone through and added to, or amended, many of the alerts that were in the original text.

I have changed them from being ^*b REAL ^*n alerts, that you should give to real opponents, and have replaced them with ^*b STUDY ^*n alerts.   Study alerts are only useful to students of Oliver's Precision.  Of course in many cases no changes were needed.   For example    1@c     16+ Any dist except 16-23 4441

It is particularly important that we make the alerts for  ^*b Asking bids and their responses^*n,  as clear as possible

	    ^c ^*b Study Alert ^*n           ^i ^*b Real Alert ^*n                ^o ^*b It would be great if you could add ^*n

		^c Alpha                           ^i Asking  in                      ^o Trump ...
		^c Gamma                           ^i Asking  in partners suit        ^o Trump ...
		^c Epsilon                         ^i Specific Ctrl Ask               ^o in ... 
		^c Hxx                             ^i Hxx                             ^o in ... 
		^c none  or  1st & 2nd             ^i none  or  1st & 2nd             ^o [xxx, AKx(x)]
		^c 3rd rd ctrl                     ^i 3rd rd ctrl                     ^o [xx, Qxx(x), Qx]
		
An easy mistake in reply to an Epsilon is when, say, you hold ^*b Q76 ^*n in the suit, and so give only ^*b Qxx ^*n in the alert.   THAT  IS  WRONG.  The agreement is ^*b 3rd round control ^*n and that is what should be told to the opps.   

The ^*b ethical ^*n problem with telling too much to your opps is that it disadvantages the other pairs who will play your opponents cards.|

at|So here South must (as they did) BID 4@S if they want to play there.  They can't bid 3@S to agree the suit and assume Opener will bid on, because they won't.

North knows that South might have nothing at all and  3343  shape here, so 3@S by South would be utterly "to play".  If South wants to be in game, they must bid it.
