Minimum   (opener minimum)


Responder will pass with the invitational hand.

If Responder continues beyond 2NT (they have the strong hand) and start bidding 4-card (or longer) suits upwards at the 3-level in search of a fit. 

Now suits are bid upwards towards 3NT and 3NT is bypassed when/if a fit is found. This can be done by explicitly agreeing the suit at the 4-level or by cue-bidding the cheapest 1st-round control held at the 4-level (whichever is the cheapest).

If Responder simply rebids 3NT over 2NT then this tends to show a very strong but flat hand with a 4-card Minor no longer interested in slam.

4-card suit   (Opener better than minimum)

Next 4-card suits continue to be bid upwards towards 3NT.  

Opener is not allowed to bypass 3NT unless a Major-suit fit is found, since Responder may only have the normal invitational hand.

Responder is allowed to go beyond 3NT to show a Minor suit fit.

A fit is shown by either explicitly agreeing it at the 4-level or by cue-bidding the cheapest 1st-round control held.

^b@2A 3NT rebid by responder is always "to play". If Opener ends up bidding 3NT and Responder now bids 4NT, this asks Opener to show any 4-card Minor-suit fit that has been "concealed" (because Opener is not allowed to bypass 3NT) and Opener shows the suit or passes (ie: Responder cannot go this route if they want to play in 6NT regardless).

with the normal invitational hand, Responder simply passes.

Any other action shows the very strong hand. 

Now 4@c is Beta and 4@d asks Opener to bid 4@h with 4-card Clubs, and 4@s with 4-card Diamonds.

Any other bids are natural and "to play" or invitational.

ht|f|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Hi Everyone and welcome to today's Precision Club session, in which the plan is that we'll be continuing our look at sequences over a 1NT Opening.

The topic today is not "Precision-specific" in that what I'm going to deal with could apply equally to ACOL, Standard American, 2/1 or any other system.

Consequently, don't be afraid to sit and play (later in the session) if you not yet "into" Precision, although the example hands do assume a VARIABLE 1NT Opening (10-12 Non-vul and 13-15 Vul).

Similarly, the scheme of responses that you play over a Precision Opening 1NT bid does not really affect any part of the system, and so you are free to use whatever scheme of responses you like.

What I am going to show you today is simply my preferred scheme.

I don't, for example, claim that what I suggest you play in these sessions is necessarily "better" than other methods, but I would make a bit of an exception for the  ^*b2-way 2@D^*n  response I'm going to show you tonight.

Coupled with non-promissory Stayman and 4-suit transfers, it provides methods for getting to the right contract that I've never found anywhere else.

If you have not already done so, please have a look at the notes I have prepared on Precision Club bidding.

You can find these on: ^p^*hhttp://ocp.pigpen.org.uk^*n

The Notes on 1NT Sequences can be found at:^p^*hhttp://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/1n.php^*n

Notes for tonight's sequences are further down that page at  ^p^*hhttp://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/1n.php##2d^*n

nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  First, as it is highly pertinent, a recap of last week's session:  
^^
We covered  ^*b1NT,  Stayman^*n  and  ^*b4-way Transfers^*n.

Because  1NT - 2@S  is a transfer to @C and  1NT - 2NT  is a transfer to Diamonds, balanced invitations to 3NT HAVE to go VIA Stayman, so  1NT - 2@C  does NOT promise a 4-card Major.

Thus the sequence  1NT - 2@C - 2x - 2NT  may or may not contain a 4-card Major.

So, if responder has an invitational hand 4-card Spades but no Hearts, and the sequence starts  1NT - 2@C - 2@H, then Responder has to now bid  2@S  to show the Spades rather than 2NT.

But  1NT - 2@C - 2@H - 3NT  still promises 4-card Spades, (because there's be no point using Stayman otherwise).

As we'll see during this week's Session, invitations that go via Stayman only want to be in game if Opener is a bursting MAXIMUM for their 1NT Opener (ie: they are only a MILD invitation).

We'll deal with STRONG invitations this week (ones where we want to be in game if Opener is anything better than a rock-bottom MINIMUM).


^*bTransfers (recap):^*n a Transfer then a bid of a new suit is always game-forcing.

1NT - 2@D      Transfer to @HHearts@H     ^*bOR^*n     a balanced invitation (2-way 2@D), covered this session    
1NT - 2@H      Transfer to @SSpades@S
1NT - 2@S      Transfer to @CClubs@C
1NT - 2NT    Transfer to @DDiamonds@D

With 2 suits you transfer into the longest  OR   (if even-suited) high-ranking of the two  and then bid the other one.
|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^| 
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  ^*bSuper-Accepts (recap):^*n  We only break transfers from STRENGTH and SUPPORT.
^^
So Opener needs to be    MAXIMUM      ^*band^*n       and to have good Controls         ^*band^*n      to have good Support 

before they consider breaking the transfer (bearing in mind Responder might have nothing at all).
^^
We need  ^*bHxxx^*n  in support of a Major.      We need at least  ^*bHxx^*n  in support of a Minor.

When super-accepting over a transfer to  @s Spades  we cue-bid our cheapest Ace.
^^
When super-accepting over a transfer to   @h Hearts  we either bid
 
^d@2the suit BELOW a worthless doubleton (xx) if we have one,    OR
 
2NT with  ^*bany 4432^*n  shape  where the doubleton isn't  "useless"    OR
  
3@H with exactly  ^*b3433^*n  shape.
^^^b@2
Over transfers to a Minor, we break by bidding the intervening suit rather than the Minor itself,  so

^d1NT   -    2@S(> @c)    -   2NT    
^d1NT   -   2NT(> @d)   -   3@C    are the super-accepts.

If you are not playing Precision, you can bid the worthless doubleton rather than the suit below.  That's entirely up to you, but if you're playing my Precision system, better to bid the suit below for consistency with the rest of the system.

pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^| 
fp|t-title|at|The  1NT - 2@d - 2@H   Sequences|fp||at|

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Ok, let's move on to tonight topic:  Stayman and Transfers still leave us with some gaps in our arsenal.

Specifically we need a way to handle very strong responding hands that don't have a long suit and putting a little more "precision" into our invitations to 3NT.

If Responder has a really strong balanced hand and we don't find a fit via Stayman, or if Responder doesn't have a 4-card Major, then the quantitative 4NT is the normal weapon of choice.

The next thing I'm going to show you is something I developed about 38 years ago.

Playing 4-suit transfers puts a lot of emphasis on Stayman for invitational sequences, and because Stayman does give opps a fair amount of information about the distribution of your hands and primarily is aimed at finding 4-4 Major suit fits, sometimes to no good effect, we wanted to find a better way.

I also really disliked the quantitative 4NT because it sometimes meant playing in 4NT rather than 3NT and going off because the cards were distributed unkindly.

You will have noticed from the outline of the scheme I gave you last week that the 1NT - 2@D sequence shows EITHER a transfer to @HHearts@H OR a invitational+ hand.

If Opener completes the transfer to 2@H and Responder then bids ANYTHING other than 2@S, this confirms they have a 5+-card heart suit and is totally natural, just like in any normal transfer scheme.  So 
^c@2
1NT - 2@D - 2@H - 3@C  ^hstill shows a Heart/Club 2-suited hand and is game-forcing

1NT - 2@D - 2@H - 3NT  ^hstill shows a game-going semi-balanced hand with 5-card Hearts 

1NT - 2@D - 2@H - 3@S  ^hshows a game-forcing Major 2-suiter with longer Hearts   (note 3@S not 2@s).

fp|t-title|at|The  1NT - 2@D - 2@h - 2@s       The  2-way 2@d|fp||at|

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   If Opener completes the transfer to 2@H and responder now bids 2@S then this 
^c@2
@.   completely CANCELS OUT the transfer

@.   is 100% artificial, says NOTHING about  SPADES

@.   shows a hand worth AT LEAST a STRONG invitation to 3NT, (one wanting to be in 3NT if Opener 
^eis better than minimum)  but can be  ^*ba lot stronger^*n  than that.
^b@2

Using this method, the hands that bid  2@D over 1NT  fall into one of the following categories:- 
^c@2
(1)   Any hand with 5-card or longer Hearts (and no longer suit),  a normal transfer hand.

(2)   Any hand that wants to be in Game if partner is BETTER THAN MINIMUM 
^d(in 3NT or a suit, depending on finding a 4-4 fit, of course).

(3)   Any hand without a 5-card suit potentially or definitely interested in a slam of some sort.
^b@2

The secret behind this method is a similar principle to transfers, in that the 2@S rebid simply asks if Opener is minimum, or BETTER THAN minimum.

If  ^*bminimum^*n, Opener rebids  ^*b2NT^*n,         ^*bANY^*n    other bid shows   ^*bbetter than minimum^*n.

The point is that when Opener shows a minimum hand, responder is in a position to continue if they wish, because we have effectively transferred to 2NT.

The 2@S rebid from South CANCELS the @H transfer and now simply asks Opener to bid 2NT if they are MINIMUM  
OR  if they are BETTER THAN MINIMUM, to bid 4-card suits upwards at the 3-level.|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|^l 3@d  ^^ ^n 3NT
^^3@D shows West's lowest 4-card suit and a hand that is better than minimum.  East bids the most likely game of 3NT

Thus the sequence   1NT - 2@D - 2@H - 2@S   is the equivalent of bidding  1NT - 2NT  completely naturally.
|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


bt||
nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  The advantage of using this method is that it can ALSO be used with hands which would otherwise bid a quantitative 1NT - 4NT, but can investigate whether Opener is minimum or maximum in a FORCING way and still play in 2NT when Responder ONLY has an invitation to 3NT, and in 3NT if Responder is very strong but we don't quite have enough for 6NT.

So 1NT - 2@D - 2@H - 2@S - 2NT(MINIMUM), Responder can pass if them have a hand that was only worth a strong invitation, or bid on if them have a hand that was exploring for slam.

The Stayman sequence  1NT - 2@C - 2x - 2NT  is still available for invitational hands.

The difference between the 2 sequences is that the Stayman sequence is used where the implication is that responder only wants to be in game only if Opener is MAXIMUM, and the 2-way 2@D sequence is used where responder wants to be in game if Opener is BETTER THAN MINIMUM.

Suppose we're vulnerable and so 1NT shows 13-15 points.

Partner opens 1NT and we've a balanced 10-count with no redeeming features.

Now we use the Stayman sequence, because we only want to be in game if Opener has a nice 15-count.

If, on the other hand, we have an 11-count rather than a 10-count, we really can't afford not to be in game if Opener has anything better than a rock-bottom minimum, so now we use the 2-way 2@D sequence, and the bidding goes  1NT - 2@D - 2@H - 2@S   (the 2@s cancels the transfer and shows the invitational hand).

Opener bids 2NT with a minimum, 3NT with a maximum 3343 or 3334 with a 4-card minor suit (NOT with 5332 shape), or bids 4+-card suits "upwards" at the 3-level if they are BETTER than MINIMUM.

If Opener bids 2NT to show a minimum, then responder can continue either by bidding 3NT or by themselves bidding 4-card suits upwards at the 3-level.

If Responder does this then they are showing a very strong hand.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Note that if you're using ONLY Stayman, West is in some difficulty here.

A lot of the time, the bidding might proceed  1NT - 2@C - 2@H - 4NT - 5@D(1or4) - 5@H  

So we end up playing one level higher than we need to (and possibly going off).
|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  One of the best things about this method is that it permits 4-4 MINOR-suit fits to be found very easily where 6@C or 6@D can be made on a 4-4 or 5-4 fit, but 6NT cannot.   Using more traditional methods, 4-4 minor-suit fits are not easy to identify because the emphasis is all on 3NT or 4-4 major suit fits.

Sometimes you can even find your way to a making 5@C or 5@D when 3NT would be struggling because of a marked weakness in one suit.

nt|^z@3^b@2|
at|
masse24: Since @D's is South's only suit, and North knows that, would  4@C  agree @D's and show the control? 

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Effectively, yes, 4@C would implicitly agree Diamonds, but better, probably to agree Diamonds specifically, especially since Hearts is North's main area of concern and so it is inviting South to start the cue-bidding in hearts if they can.

Yes, 4@C effectively does the same, but it's not unknown for partners to get the wrong idea.  :)
|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


bt||
nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Note that since South cannot have 4-card Clubs, there is no way 4@C could be suggesting Clubs as trumps.

With 5+ card Clubs, and 4-card @H, we'd be bidding  1NT - 2@S - 3@C - 3@H  but like I said, better to agree the trump suit explicitly if you can.

The time you might do it IMPLICITLY is in a different situation when you could only agree it explicitly at game level and so risk it being misinterpreted as a sign-off.

If responder does anything OTHER than bid 2@S over  1NT - 2@D - 2@H,  then this confirms the transfer to hearts and carries the normal meaning it would have done anyway.

Thus  1NT - 2@D - 2@H - 2NT  is a semi-balanced invitation with a 5-card heart suit, and  1NT - 2@D - 2@H - 3@C   shows a game-forcing Heart Club 2-suiter. 

The bid "lost" by this method is one used to show a game-forcing 2-suiter with 4-card spades and 5-card or longer Hearts.

The 2@S rebid would be forcing in any transfer system, so the sequence  1NT - 2@D - 2@H - 3@S  is used with a hand of that type.

Similarly the sequence 

^c1NT - 2@C - 2@D - 3@H   could be used with a hand that was only worth an invitation, and

^c1NT - 2@C - 2@D - 2@H   for a weak hand of this shape.

So we do potentially lose one round of bidding when Responder has a slam-going hand Major 2-suiter with longer Hearts (because Responder has to rebid 3@S rather than 2@S), but what we GAIN from the 2-way 2@D vastly outweighs that.

fp|t-title|at|The  1NT - 2@d         Super Accept  Re-visited|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  You may remember that earlier I said that if Opener wants to "super-accept" over a  1NT - 2@D  sequence, we use the "worthless-doubleton" method rather than cue-bidding our cheapest Ace.

This is very important to remember and there's a very good reason why: Over a sequence like 1NT - 2@H, we KNOW Responder has at least a 5-card Spade suit, but if we are using the  2-way 2@D,  that is not necessarily true.

If we super-accept over  1NT - 2@D,  Responder may not have Hearts at all and showing a worthless doubleton if we have one helps to ensure that we do not get into "silly" 3NT contracts where we have xx opposite something like Jxx when there may be a better alternative on offer.

Suppose you hold   @Sxx  @HQJ98  @DAQxx  @cAQx   ...and partner bids  2@D  over your Vulnerable 1NT Opening.

You super-accept with  3@D  (the suit below the doubleton, skipping 'agreed' trumps)  rather than  2@H.

If Responder has 5+ Hearts then you sail away to your Heart contract at whatever level Responder dictates.

Suppose, Responder has a holding like this:   @S10x  @HAKx  @Dxxx  @CKJ109x

Over Opener's  3@d (showing a @s dbltn) super-accept, Responder knows that 3NT is not a safe resting spot and that playing 4@H in a Moysian fit is hugely safer.

If Opener had cue-bid their cheapest Ace instead of showing a worthless doubleton, we would be none the wiser and would probably end up in a hopeless 3NT.

This is the reason why we break the transfers differently over  1NT - 2@D   compared to    1NT - 2@H.
|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|The  1NT - 2@d        When Opener super accepts and we  ^*bdon't^*n  have Hearts|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  So over  1NT - 2@H,  if we super-accept the trannsfer to Spades, we're ALWAYS going to end up playing this hand in Spades, but the same is NOT true over  1NT - 2@D  if the 2@D bid is 2-way.

I am now going to briefly cover how we continue when Opener super-accepts Hearts, but Responder doesn't have a 5-card or even a 4-card Heart suit.

Responders action will always depend on  
^c(1)   The strength and distribution of their own hand and
^c(2)   Exactly HOW Opener breaks the transfer.

As I said before, to break the transfer to 2@H, Opener will be   maximum,  have decent controls  and  GOOD 4-card @H support (at least Hxxx).

They will bid the suit BELOW a worthless doubleton if they have one, bid 2NT with a 4432 shape hand that doesn't have a worthless doubleton, or 3@H with a 3433 shape hand.

So how Responder proceeds depends on which is these methods Opener choose and how that marries up with Responder's strength and distribution.

Mainly, Responder takes some action that doesn't involve supporting Hearts.

This will often involve merely bidding 3NT if they had an invitational strength hand unless Opener's bid has pinpointed a worthless-doubleton that matches a weakness in Responder's hand.

Similarly if they had an invitational strength hand WITH 5-card or even 4-card Hearts, they'll just bid game in Hearts.

If Responder starts bidding OTHER suits, then they're either looking for a game other than 3NT because we have a matching weakness in one suit, or they're looking for a slam.
|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  There are no particular rules that apply in these situations and the bidding will proceed naturally.

Sometimes you might even end up playing in a Moysian fit at the 4-level in a Major rather than at the 5-level in a Minor or in 3NT.


|fp|t-title|at|Which to use     ^*b Stayman^*n    or the    ^*b 2-way 2@D^*n    ?|fp||at|^^^^|

at|So when do we use  Stayman  and when the  2-way 2@D  given we have a balanced hand?  Suppose Opener has opened a  13-15  1NT and we are balanced with an HCP of
^c@2
0 - 9   ^e^*b Pass^*n   since we can't possibly get to game.

10      ^e^*b Stayman^*n   because we only want to be in game opposite a maximum.

11      ^e^*b 2-way 2@D^*n   because we want to be in game unless Opener is minimum.

12 - 14 ^e^*b 3NT^*n   or use  ^*bStayman^*n  to find a fit, because we want to be in game whatever Opener has.
^f@2We might use the  ^*b2-way 2@D^*n  if we have a 4-4 in the Minors and weak doubleton in a Major 
(OR  perhaps if we're 4144 or similar)   in case  5@C or 5@D  might be better than 3NT.
^c@2
15+, ^e^*b 2-w@2ay 2@D^*n   We tend to use the  ^*b2-way 2@D^*n  because it's better at finding the Minor-suit fits as well as Major-suit fits and we're starting to think in terms of a slam.
^b@2

So as you can see there's no simple rule as to whether you use  Stayman  or the  2-way 2@D.

It chops and changes according to Responder's exact strength relative to the 1NT Opening, and their distribution 
|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  The 2-way 2@D works with ANY strength 1NT Opening and ANY system.

The only "cost" in using it is losing one round of bidding when Responder has a slam-going Major 2-suiter with longer Hearts.

Used appropriately, it's an invaluable additional to our 1NT arsenal, more flexible than Minor-suit Stayman and allows us to explore for slam values at the 2-level rather than having to bid a quantitative 4NT, and STILL be able to try to find a fit in a Major OR a Minor whether Opener is minimum or maximum.

The combination of non-promissory Stayman, 4-suit transfers and the 2-way 2@D has been extensively used and tested over 30 years and I've never found any alternative method that consistently gives as good results.

The laws of the game say that what we have to put in the alert is  ^*b our agreement with partner ^*n about that bid.

While creating these bridge movies, I have gone through and added to, or amended, many of the alerts that were in the original text.

I have changed them from being ^*b REAL ^*n alerts, that you should give to real opponents, and have replaced them with ^*b STUDY ^*n alerts.   Study alerts are only useful to students of Oliver's Precision.  Of course in many cases no changes were needed.   For example    1@c     16+ Any dist except 16-23 4441

It is particularly important that we make the alerts for  ^*b Asking bids and their responses^*n,  as clear as possible

An easy mistake in reply to an Epsilon is when, say, you hold ^*b Q76 ^*n in the suit, and so give only ^*b Qxx ^*n in the alert.   THAT  IS  WRONG.  The agreement is ^*b 3rd round control ^*n and that is what should be told to the opps.   

The ^*b ethical ^*n problem with telling too much to your opps is that it disadvantages the other pairs who will play your opponents cards.|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  The important thing is to avoid the doomed 3NT game.

2-way 2@D  provides you with a mechanism to do just that.

If North had a 14-count opposite the mini 1NT, then they'd use the  2-way 2@D

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  As shown above, the bid of 3@H over 3@D is best (as opposed to 3NT)

because West can now bid 3NT to deny having 4-card @H's,  so no risk of missing a 4-4 Major fit.

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  As here, raises to 2NT must go via  Stayman  or the  2-way 2@D  because  1NT - 2NT  is an xfer to @D.

That's an inevitable effect of playing 4-way transfers  so again, South ONLY wants to be in 3NT opposite a Maximum.

pg| ***** 134 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|at|^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  If you decide (as South here) to upgrade your hand because of great fillers, or whatever, and use 2@D rather than 2@C, then that's fine, as long as you understand what partner will be doing in response to each.  No Trump bidding with 2 balanced hands is most a matter of arithmetic and probabilities.

Unless you're Meckstroth and Rodwell or Lauria and Versace, you generally want to have 25HCP between 2 balanced hands to be in 3NT,  23-24 to be in 2NT.   Once long suits come into play, that changes, of course.

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  As shown above  2-way 2@D  is a good way to go.
^^2NT simply denies having 4-card or longer @H's  and shows a Club stopper or two. 
^^Now bidding proceeds naturally.   East shows their second suit with  3@S  and West bids the game.

pg| ***** 149 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|at|^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  If West was 4-4 in the Minors, they would simply bid 3NT instead of 4@S.
^^Similarly, if East had 4-card @D instead of @S, they would rebid 3@D and now West would bid 3NT.
^^ok?
