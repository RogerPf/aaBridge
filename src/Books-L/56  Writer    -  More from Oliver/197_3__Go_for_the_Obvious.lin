n#|3|at|^^^e^*bDangers: ^*n Clearly there is a Diamond ruff in the offing which is not quite such a problem if it's the hand with 3 or more trumps that's ruffing, because they'll probably be ruffing with a natural trump trick, but it'll definitely cost you the contract if it's the hand with shorter trumps that is ruffing. |

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|    ^*bOptions: ^*n  If Spades are 6-2 (reasonable on the bidding) you might be able to get across to Dummy safely to lead the J@H, possibly pinning the singleton @h10 in West's hand, but that is a fairly fanciful distribution to play for.|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


n#|3|at|^^Why look for exotic solutions when by far the most sensible thing is just to play for a 3-2 trump break ?
Bang down the Ace of @h's and lead a second @h towards the Jack.   This assures you of  9  tricks whenever the trumps are 3-2.   Moreover, the opening lead (@d2) looks and feels like a singleton, which makes a singleton @h with West more unlikely.|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   When you can see Opps are likely to start ruffing, then unless an alternative strategy is obvious, it often pays to forget about subtle plays such as finesses and just go for the quickest method of divesting Opps of their trumps.   The probability of a 3-2 split in @h is nearly 70%. Why look further?   If the trumps are 4-1 the likelihood is that you're going to be down ^*i however ^*n you play the hand.  Here you can afford to lose two trump tricks so best to just go ahead and lose them as quickly as possible  |
