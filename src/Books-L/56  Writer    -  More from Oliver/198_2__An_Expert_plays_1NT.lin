n#|3|at|^^|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Occasionally a hand comes along where you get everything right, which can be very satisfying.  It is especially satisfying when OCP has got you to a reasonable contract when a third of the tables are passing the hand out.     You play to give yourself every chance just to make a contract that isn't totally straightforward, but end up making overtricks because some or all of what you played for actually came about. |

n#|3|at|^^|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Although you have 23 hcp between the two hands and 1NT ought to be fairly straightforward, your lack of intermediates is a worry here.   You can count on 1@s, 2@h's, 1@d and 1@c, so need to engineer two more tricks from somewhere.|

at|   You can play the @dQ at trick 1, but that's putting all of your eggs in one basket, and if West has the King of @d, you will always get a second @d trick.|

at|^^|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Brilliant play ?
No, not really.
You can only play as well as Opps allow you on many occasions.  Here an initial @h lead might have left me struggling to find my 7th trick before EW got their 7th.   Similarly, West rising with the King of @d on the second round of the suit was a serious mistake, because it exposed their Jack.   What I got right, was to realise after trick 1, that I had to try to make something of the @s, and just playing a small @s towards Dummy is an "all or nothing" play for West to have the Ace.   Leading the 10 encouraged West to cover with their Jack and now when they turned up with the 9 and the suit is split 3-3, I've ended up with 3 tricks in the suit rather than 1 or 2. 

The other thing is to do with developing tricks before you cash quick tricks elsewhere. I could have continued @s immediately after finessing the 8, but that puts a tiny bit of pressure on me to find a discard (@H is easy enough), but also it doesn't give Opps the opportunity to mistakenly discard a @s, which would have assured me of the 3rd @s trick whatever the position was.   I ended up taking the last 5 tricks having spent the time developing those 5 tricks and getting rid of Opps' winners that were in my way.   The other thing about cashing winners is that it can compromise transport between the two hands when you might be able to use those entries back and forth later on.

On the Traveller, the hand was inevitably passed out at several tables. Several pairs were going off in 2NT or even 1NT (or 2@D or 2@S ), but the biggest block were in 1NT making exactly or with 1 overtrick only. Only one other pair gained 9 tricks in No Trumps.|
