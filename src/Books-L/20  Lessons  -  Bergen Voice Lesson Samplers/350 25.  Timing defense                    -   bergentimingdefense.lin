|fp|2|at|A Marty Bergen Audio Visual Lesson

^b@2Every two months Marty Bergen and Howard produce an animated voice lesson. Using any computer with a browser (PC, Mac, iPad, etc.) you can hear Marty speak for several hours and thoroughly cover his topic. Not only does he discuss the basics, but he includes many "secrets of the experts" as well. I have found these movies very useful and enjoyable. 

If you are interested in seeing a demonstration lesson, click here |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/dngcdx^*N|CP||AT|. Note that the web site includes some free examples with some interesting bridge puzzles that Marty has created.

I have permission from Marty and Howard to use one example from each lesson to produce a bridge movie. This sampler will give you the flavor of the material that Marty presents and demonstrate his excellent teaching style.

In this movie I chose an example hand from the lesson entitled "Timing Is Everything - Defense" released in November 2014. In this sampler Marty presents his excellent teaching style particularly for those who wish to excel in defending. 

Hand 1, my pick for this movie, is a simple 2@S contract which requires two critical plays at the right timing to assure the success in setting the contract. I have, further, used the Movie Maker's magic to hide the other hands which only can sharpen your focus. At first you are quizzed about the bidding followed by asking you to make your plan to make the contract and make those critical moves without being able to see the opponents' hands. Then after reading his instructions you can play the board double dummy. ^*BI wish I could do this to all the boards in this lesson. But then I would be out of my day time job -:).^*N|ht|z|at|

Please tap the blue "Next Page" top left to begin the sampler. But first Marty's introductions -- you will get a summary.

^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|In these lessons, in addition to deciding what card you should play at trick 1, you should be thinking about planning your defense. You should try and see how you can defeat the contract. On some of the hands, you will be asked at several different points what you should do.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

I certainly hope you are ready to count. Without counting, even if your instincts are good, it is impossible to defend well. What should you be trying to count? High card points. Start off by counting yours and adding it to what the dummy has. Your goal is to try and zero in on the number of points declarer has and what your partner might have. Also try to count distribution. Very often the bidding will give nice clues. When your partner makes the opening lead, thinking about which spot card he led (if he did not lead an honor) can be very helpful. Keep the Rule of 11 in mind especially in a notrump contract.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|

When possible try and focus on the number of winners and losers for both your side and what the declarer might have. See where the weak spots for the declaring side might be. Of course I will offer you help. But you want to get in in the habit of giving your best effort and thinking about your defense on every hand.|

You are East with a pretty heart suit. South opens 1@S. Your partner passes. North raises to 2@S. You have nothing you can say nor does anyone else. So the final contract is 2@S.|

In addition to which club should you play, you should be thinking about the rest of the hand. If you feel your club choice is dependent on the rest of the hand, I totally agree with you. With a doubleton, some players would encourage clubs by playing the @C10|

declarer will be able to draw trump and make use of dummy's nice diamonds. It should not surprise you that declarer has trump strength. There really is no other place he could be strong for his opening bid.|

Declarer makes an overtrick.|

So instead of encouraging clubs by playing the @C10,|up|42|sk|e|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


AT| you should discourage clubs by playing the @C5.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT|
There is no law that says you must play high-low with a doubleton. You don't want partner to lead more clubs. |
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT|
You are desperately eager for a heart shift. How will partner know to lead hearts rather than diamonds? Looking at the relative strength of those two suits in dummy, the logic should be clear. So after you correctly play the @C5|pc|c5c6|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT|
Your partner shifts to the @H9.|PC|h9|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT|
It could be a doubleton. But it could also just be top of nothing which would be helpful to you if you had a heart holding headed by the @HAQJ.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT|
Dummy plays low |pc|h2|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


AT| and you win the @H10 as declarer follows with the @H4.|pc|hth4|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT|
You obviously return the @C10 as declarer plays the @CQ and your partner wins the @CK.|
pc|ctcqckc8|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT|
Partner continues with the @H8 which should be 'present count.'|
pc|h8|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT|
That means he either started with exactly 2 hearts or he started with 3 hearts and has a doubleton heart at this point. With a doubleton heart remaining, he is leading high-low to show his doubleton. If he had started with 4 hearts headed by the @H9, he would continue with his lowest heart to show he had 3 hearts left.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT|
On the @H8 lead,|
pc|h8|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


AT| declarer plays the @HK and you win the @HA.|
pc|hkhah5|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT|
You lead a third round of hearts which you know will cash based on partner's @H8 lead. Everyone follows.|
pc|hqh6h7h3|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||lb|*CAt this point, what would you lead? Click that card on the right.^^hj^Sqjhjd87432|nt|
You don't want to lead a diamond. Leading a trump will be helping declarer accomplish what he wants to do ' drawing trump. So your correct lead is a 4th round of hearts. You are hoping that your partner has something interesting in trump.|PC|HJ|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT|
It doesn't take a lot. Declarer should ruff with the @S10 as that is his correct play.|sk||
pc|stc2c9|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT|
It is not an obvious play. But he can't afford to ruff with the @SA or @SK. He is hoping that you have the @SQ and @SJ. If he ruffed low, it would be overwhelmingly likely that he would be overruffed.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT|
If declarer makes the correct play of the @S10, he will win the trick. He will lead the @SA and @SK to remove your @SQ and @SJ.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |

But your partner will take the setting trick with the @S9.|

PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT|
If declarer had chosen to ruff with a smaller spade,|up|15|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |

pc|s6s9d6|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


NT|
He could then lead a club for you to ruff.|
pc|c4c9sjcj|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |

And then declarer would be down an extra trick. |
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


nt|
Regardless, by signaling with a low club at trick 1 and leading a 4th round of hearts, you get a well earned plus score that many pairs would not get.|
