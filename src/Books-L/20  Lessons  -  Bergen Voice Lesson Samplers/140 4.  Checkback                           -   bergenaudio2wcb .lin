Every 2 months Marty Bergen creates an animated voice lesson which you can play on your computer'PC, Apple, or any device having a browser. I have his permission to produce a movie using a short synopsis from each of his lessons. I think you will find what Marty has to say very interesting and useful. His September 2015 lesson titled "2 Way Checkback" is one of his longest and probably one of his best. This is really a very small sampler and without becoming a marketing agent, I strongly recommend studying the lesson and enjoy it. BTW, he discusses the bidding for 50+ boards which by itself is a great learning experience even if you do not wish to adopt the 2 Way Checkback.

^-{ The Case Against New Minor Forcing }
^-|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|The problems with New Minor Forcing bid stem from the ambiguity of the bid. Sometimes responder has an invitational hand. Other times he has enough to force to game. Next I like to illustrate a few of them.|

No problem. Responder has 5 spades and interest in a spade game or possibly a NT and if opener has a maximum. So he bids 2@D as New Minor Forcing.|MB|2dp|

Opener has no major and does not have a maximum. So he bids 2NT. Responder, only holding an invitational hand, passes.|MB|2nppp|md|0,0,saj932h4daj87cj53,0|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Yuck! This is not a good contract. On an opening heart lead, the defense will take at least 5 heart tricks and 2 club tricks. 2NT is down at least 2.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|After responder bid the new minor (2@D in this case), opener's first priority is to show length in a major when he has it. With 3 spades or 4 hearts, he will bid his major. With neither major he bids NT. |
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Usually he bids 2NT, but with a maximum he will jump to 3NT. And he needs to jump to 3NT with the right hand because he does not want to languish in a part score when responder only has an invitational hand.|

Look what happens on this hand. The auction starts 1@C-1@H-1NT, a routine auction. This time responder has a very nice hand, definitely enough for game. With his club fit and singleton, a slam is possible. He certainly likes having his 14 HCP in aces and kings.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So again responder bids 2@D as New Minor Forcing.|MB|2d|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


AT| Opener has 14 HCP, a 5-card suit, and 2 upgradeable honors in responder's suit. So he has a clear maximum and jumps to 3NT. He can't risk responder passing 2NT. I think most good players would pass 3NT with responder's hand. That is what I would do. |mb|p3nppp|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Yes, you might belong in clubs or hearts, but you really don't want to introduce another suit at the 4-level. Not to mention there are some players who would treat a 4@C bid by responder as Gerber.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On a diamond lead, a suit in which the opponents have length and strength, 3NT is going down real fast. Meanwhile 4@H, 5@C, and even 6@C are all reasonable contracts.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|In summary, here is New Minor Forcing reality. Because New Minor Forcing is not forcing to game, it is a "maybe" situation. Responder does not promise a rebid. This means opener must jump with a maximum. This often gets in responder's way as we saw in Hand 2.|

Responder bids 2@C with an invitational hand
and 
bids 2@D to force to game.|FP||
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


AT|

There are 2 very distinct and specific paths responder can take. That is the key. Both players immediately know where the auction stands. Later on, no one has to wonder if partner's bid was or was not forcing. That is huge.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


AT|

2@C denies the strength to force to game. After 2@C we will sometimes get to game. However opener is more likely to have 12 HCP than 14 so much of the time we will stop in a part score. That is particularly true if we don't have an 8-card major suit fit.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


AT|

But when responder bids 2@D to force to game, the auction proceeds as if you had a 2 Over 1 Game Forcing auction. You have plenty of room to exchange information and decide which suit or NT to play in. You have no fear that you might be left in a part score. No one is ever forced to jump.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


AT|

If responder is sure he wants to play in 3NT or 4 of a major, he is welcome to jump there. But opener never jumps. In 2 Way Checkback auctions, opener's 1NT rebid says a lot about his strength and distribution. So it is much easier for both players to bid accurately.|

^-{ Responder Bids 2@C Over 1NT }^-|cp|8|AT|^b@2

^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Our first topic discusses the auction when responder bids 2@C over opener's 1NT rebid. ^*NThis is an artificial bid denying the strength to force to game. It is one of the key bids in 2 Way Checkback.^*N|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


AT| 

Over 2@C, opener ^*BMUST^*N bid 2@D. Period. Case closed. No exceptions. For the time being, responder is totally in charge.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


AT|

When responder has less than a game forcing hand, it is critical that he talk about his distribution immediately. Opener's 1NT rebid defined his hand type. But responder's first bid did not define his hand. That is one of the reasons that New Minor Forcing handles invitational hands so badly. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


AT|

By contrast, the 2@C bid is one of the best features of 2 Way Checkback. Until responder has said what he needs to, there is no chance that opener can get in responder's way. After responder has spoken, then and only then will opener resume being an active participant.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


AT| 

If responder wants to play in 2@D, he will pass opener's forced 2@D bid. This does not happen often. But it is one of the nice features of the convention. Responder can bid 2@C with a weak hand, positive that opener will bid 2@D. When responder has the right hand where 2@D is where he wants to play, he will go this route. |

^-{ Responder Bids 2@C Over 1NT - Conti.}
^-|cp|8|AT|^b@2
^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|But the vast majority of the time, responder has an invitational hand. Responder will make a natural bid over 2@D. When he bids, he is saying he has exactly an invitational hand, nothing more and nothing less. He is describing his distribution, often announcing that he has a 5-card major. He only promised a 4-card major with his first bid. Whatever responder does, if he jumps (which is possible), it is not forcing. That is because responder chose to bid 2@C over 1NT rather than a game forcing 2@D. |
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


AT|

If opener chooses to bid over responder's invitational bid, that also is not forcing. Since the 2@C bid denied a game forcing hand, you will often stop in a part score. All bids, both suits and 2NT, are possible final contracts. |
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


AT|

This is very different from New Minor Forcing. Responder's new minor bid might be based on a game forcing hand or even a bigger hand. Both players must devote a great deal of energy trying to figure out 'Should I keep bidding or can I pass?' |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


AT|

When responder holds an invitational hand, does he always have a 5-card major? The answer is no. But it is true that he most often has exactly 5 cards in his original major. With that hand, he will usually bid 2 of the major over 2@D. |
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


AT|

But other times responder could have a 4-card major or a 6-card major. One time that responder may have only 4 cards in his original major is when he passes 2@D. Then nobody cares how many cards he has in his major because the auction is over. More likely, when responder supports opener's minor, he will have a big fit for that suit and very possibly a side 4-card major. Next are some examples where it is right to bid 2@C over 1NT.|

In the world of New Minor Forcing, responder would have to bid 2@D and opener would bid 2NT and play it there. Yikes! He is certainly losing at least 4 spade tricks and a lot of club tricks. The auction is so much better with 2 Way Checkback. The 2@C bid forces opener to rebid 2@D and ensures that he won't get in responder's way.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Responder will get to talk about his 5-card major at the 2-level. Since responder has guaranteed only an invitational hand, opener can confidently pass without fear of missing a game or playing in a bad 2NT contract.|

That is not a suit I am particularly eager to play in.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I know that length is more important than strength. But never forget that the strength of your long suits does matter, often greatly. In general, if you have a suit you don't want to play in, don't bid it. Responder is not interested in playing in hearts. |

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|This time responder has a 5th heart. So after opener's forced 2@D bid, responder jumps to 3@H. This says responder is 5-5 in the majors. It is not forcing. It is invitational. That is what responder said when he bid 2@C over 1NT.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now opener thinks 'Oh! My partner has a 5th heart so we definitely have an 8-card heart fit. I love my 3 heart honors. I don't mind my 2 little spades although I would rather have some strength. Maybe I can get a ruff. And I have an ace on the side. I am happy to accept partner's invitation now that I am sure we have real heart fit.' So he bids 4@H. That is a sensible contract.|

^-{ Responder Bids 2@D Over 1NT}
^-|cp|8|AT|^b@2
^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|We are now ready for responder's 2@D rebid. When responder bids 2@D over 1NT, this artificial bid is forcing to game. Responder might have slam interest. But since game contracts occur far more often than slams, most of the time responder will be searching for the best game. As you will see later on in the lesson, there are some special bids set aside for slam tries that do not require that responder start with 2@D. But for now we will focus on the 2@D auctions which are more important for you to understand. (MM: We are not going to to report the slam tries.)|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


AT|

Unless responder's first bid was 1@D, he usually has a 5-card major when he bids 2@D over 1NT. But, as with the 2@C response, it is possible that responder has a 4-card major or a 6-card major. With a 4-card major, opener almost always has good support for opener's minor.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


AT|

Over 2@D, opener gets to talk about his distribution. Since we know we are going to game, we have lots of room. So now we can allow opener to talk first. That is different than the 2@C auction. That is logical. Here we have time. With 2@C, responder needed to talk first.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


AT|

So in the first bid after 2@D, opener talks about his hand. Then responder gets his chance. Later on, both players will do the best they can, just like in a 2 over 1 auction. But unlike 2 over 1 auctions, because of the 1NT bid, opener has told a lot about his hand already. Therefore responder is the boss. But of course even the smartest boss sometimes needs information that only his subordinate can supply.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |

We are now ready to discuss opener's rebid after 2@D. First of all, he must not jump. Period. |
