j|wb|C|bm|http://www.martybergen.com/test/images/Marty-sitephoto-smfr.jpg|HT|K|AT|^i@2Every 2 months Marty Bergen creates an animated voice lesson which you can play on any device having a browser. I have his permission to produce a movie using one hand from each of his lessons. I think you will find what Marty has to say very interesting and useful. From his lesson titled "The Joy Of End Plays" I have selected hand number I. It illustrates how to set up a standard end play as well as several other bidding and declarer play points of interest.|

HT|r|AT|^C@2The lesson has a smart "Introduction" on the how to set an End Play followed by 15 examples. Each example contains bridge pearls by Marty Bergen in addition to the specific topic of End Plays.

^-|fp||VA|4|cp||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Many players think that end plays are for experts only. This is not true. In this lesson I will show you how easy it is on many deals to set up and execute an end play. If you go through the lesson carefully and practice with the example hands, you will become proficient in end plays and make many contracts that would otherwise go down. In the deals that follow, you will see that end plays in no trump contracts do exist. However, since there is no such thing as a ruff/sluff in no trump, end plays occur far more often in suit contracts. The following steps regarding end plays in suit contracts are worth noting and keeping in mind.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |

^*BStep 1^*N. You need to see if you have an �iffy� suit. What is an iffy suit? It is a suit where the outcome is uncertain. Queen-third opposite jack-third is an iffy suit. Here are some examples of suits that are not iffy. Ace-small opposite 2-small is not iffy. Neither is queen-third opposite jack-ten-third. The presence of the ten ensures that you will take one trick. Even if your queen and jack are captured, your ten will take a trick. Without the ten it is very different. |

^*BStep 2^*N. All end plays require a throw-in card. This is an inevitable loser that you can afford to lose. |
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|

^*BStep 3^*N. Before end playing a defender you must strip the hand so that any suit a defender has left will eliminate a loser in your iffy suit. This will usually require you to remove all of the cards in one or two suits from both your hand and dummy. Now if the defender leads a suit in which you are void in both hands, he is giving you a ruff/sluff. You can profit from it by discarding a loser in your iffy suit. On some hands, in order to do all the required stripping, you will have to carefully manage your entries. |
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|

^*BStep 4^*N. In order to profit from a ruff/sluff, you must have at least one trump in each hand. Therefore your chances for an end play are far greater when you have at least a 9-card fit. This allows you to draw trump and still have some left even if you had to do some ruffing.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


AT| 

^*BStep 5^*N. Once you have set the scene by doing the stripping, you lead your throw-in card to execute the end play. |
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


AT|

^*BStep 6^*N. If you are given a ruff/sluff, you need to decide which card you should discard, eliminating the loser that you are dying to get rid of, and then ruff in the other hand. |

sk|n|lb|*bMake a bid for North.^^3s|cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|The correct response with the North hand is 3@S. This shows a weak hand with 4 spades. If West had passed, then the only Norths who would have bid 3@s are those that play Bergen Raises. But after the double, it is highly recommended for all players at all levels that the jump raise be weak. |
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|With a limit raise you could redouble first and then raise. If you play Bergen Raises over a takeout double, you could make a Bergen (or Reverse Bergen) raise. Or you can play Jordan 2NT, which is only used after a takeout double. It is an excellent convention that is not appreciated by enough players. It should be standard for all.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Note that after a minor suit is opened and doubled, and there is no Bergen Raise. Even if you played them, you need to play Jordan 2NT to show a limit raise or better. Whether you are happy with 3@s or would have bid 2@s, 3@s is the bid that North is going to make.|mb|3sP|

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|East will pass. It is not easy to come in at this level.|

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|What should South bid?|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


AT| ^*BWith the South hand, I would bid 4@s.^*N|mb|4s|at| I have a nice hand, but opposite a weak hand it is far from certain that I am going to be able to take 10 tricks. But can you picture, looking at the South hand that, even if partner has as little as the @cK and 2 little hearts, that is enough to make 4@s? |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|In addition to your 6 spade winners, you will win 2 club tricks and 2 heart ruffs for a total of 10 tricks. Partner's extra trump is huge. If partner had only 3 spades, you would not be able to get 2 heart ruffs. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|With my 10-card fit, I am following the Law of Total Tricks. It suggests that when you have a 10-card fit you are happy to play at the 10 trick 4- level. I would prefer to have stronger hearts. But with 6-4 bid more. So I am bidding 4@s. And that will end the auction.|mb|ppp|

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|The opening lead is the @cK.|PC|ck|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


at| I see that dummy is suitable. But I do wish the @D10 could be relocated as the @H10. We are faced with an iffy heart suit. It could be fatal that we are missing the @H10 if we lead hearts. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|What I would like to do is strip the diamonds. Then, after drawing trump, I will throw them in with my inevitable club loser. Whichever opponent wins the club trick will be end played. He will be forced to lead hearts or give me a ruff/sluff. |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Either will let me eliminate my 3rd heart loser. I have a lot of diamond ruffing to do. There is no time like the present. It would be very wrong to draw trump first.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Do you see there is one further thing to think about? I am going to need entries to dummy. Once I play the @DA and another diamond, the only entries to dummy are dummy's trump. |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|My trump are pretty high. So when I ruff diamonds, I must ruff high and preserve my precious @S9 and @S7 so that I can use dummy's @S10 and @S8 as entries. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|All this thinking should be done before winning the @CA, even before playing a club from dummy. Now is the time to think. If your opponents are getting a little impatient because you are pausing for 45 seconds or whatever time it takes, that is their error. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Once you formulate your plan and get started, the hand is going to go pretty quickly. Here we go. |

Ruff a diamond high, |pc|d8djsjd3|AT| say with the @SJ. It does not matter which spade honor you use. |

Lead the @S7 and overtake with the @S8. You are pleased that both opponents follow. |PC|s7s5s8s3|

Ruff a diamond with the @SQ. Lead the @S9 and overtake with the @S10. This draws the last trump. |PC|d9dqsqd5|

Lead dummy's last diamond and ruff with the @SK.|PC|dtc5skd7|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT|^B@2
At this point, you only have one trump left in your hand, the @SA. But that is fine. Dummy has two small trump left. You do have trump in both hands. |
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You now exit with your club loser.|pc|c4|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


AT| You don't know which opponent will win the trick. But you don't care. Here is their dilemma.|
pc|cqc7c6|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You and dummy are both void in clubs and diamonds. If they lead a minor suit, you must think about what card you are eager to get rid of. |
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Getting rid of one of your 4 hearts, so you still have 3 hearts opposite 3 hearts, would still leave you with 3 potential heart losers. Therefore you want to get rid of one of dummy's 3 hearts. |
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT||
at|Once dummy is reduced to only having 2 hearts, you can't possibly lose more than 2 heart tricks. So if they lead a minor, you discard dummy's @H2 and ruff with your @SA. Concede 2 heart tricks and claim making 4@S.|pc|dkh2ctsa|NT|^B@2
Here is the ruff/sluff.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


SK||at|

The opponents probably won't give you a ruff/sluff. |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


up|4|NT|^B@2They will probably lead a heart.|pc|h9|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


AT| When they do, you play 2nd hand low. Once they initiate hearts, you
get to play �last is best�. |pc|h6hkh3|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You will never lose more than 2 heart tricks. So you will make your ambitious 4@S game.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |
