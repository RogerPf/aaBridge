Make The Most

Of Your Preempts

^-|fp||cs||cp||ht|q|AT|^k@2  By Marty Bergen BBO nickname mbsez; |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.martybergen.com^*N|CP||ht|r|AT|^b@2
Every 2 months Marty Bergen creates an animated voice lesson which you can play on your computer'PC, Apple, or any device having a browser. I have his permission to produce a movie using one hand from each of his lessons. I think you will find what Marty has to say very interesting and useful. This movie uses a hand (hand 5) from the lesson entitled "Make The Most Of Your Preempts." For further information about Mr. Bergen's voice lessons, click this |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/vulnxw^*N|CP||AT| link. 

The hand I have selected for this mini-movie'as other hands'is chock full of many other Bergen's pearls covering issues beside preempting. To appreciate all that Mr. Bergen has to offer, it would be best to experience the entire lesson. It will be well worth your while, and then some! Please click the forward arrow to begin a short introduction followed by the selected hand. All the text are from his lesson's transcript unless when it is headed by the Movie Maker (MM).|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NMr. Bergen's audio visual lesson covering "Make The Most Of Your Preempts" has an excellent introduction which covers his aggressive style and various key points in bidding preempts from which I will bring you only a summary. Then there are 25 hands. From those I have selected one ( Hand number 5 ) which I liked best. First is the introduction.|

Cs||FP||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, I am a very aggressive preempter. Some experts are not. It's a matter of style. You must decide which style is most appropriate for yourself. |
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|

However, you should not think that aggressive preempting is only appropriate for advanced players who tend to play their cards better than intermediates. In fact, the opposite is true. In this lesson I will discuss at length the two important considerations.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|

The first consideration is whether you should preempt. The second consideration is how much to preempt. We all know the traditional advice. However, as you will see, the important factors that influence us will sometimes dictate that we preempt with a non-traditional hand at a non-traditional level. |
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|

The first order of business is to debunk the two popular misconceptions regarding preempts. They are:|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |

pg| ***** 7 ***** |


cp||fp||at|

^B@2Neither is accurate as long as you understand the situation. Would I preempt with a major suit of ace-queen-ten-nine on the side in addition to my long suit? Of course not.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


at|

^*BMM: ^*NMr. Bergen, in the lesson, convincingly debunk both conventional wisdoms and follows with "Important Factors When Preempting." Among many, in order of importance, they are listed next.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Distribution particularly the distribution in the 3 other suits.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


AT| 

Vulnerability. You are not vulnerable and the opponents are vulnerable is the best of all. But don't overreact to vulnerability.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


AT|
  
Seat or position. First seat is a very good time to preempt with a weak hand. The second seat is not as desirable as first seat for preempting. The third seat is a wonderful time to preempt'even better than first seat. Mr. Bergen strongly recommends preempting very aggressively in third seat, especially when not vulnerable. And then there is fourth seat. A fourth seat weak 2-bid does exist but it is a strong preempt.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


AT|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NPlease do not avoid making a fourth seat strong preempt until you get to read his logic.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


AT| 

The next factor is the rank of the suit. "A spade preempt is very effective because the opponents cannot bid a suit at the same level that you did. In general it is great to preempt in a major. But do not overlook preempts in a minor."|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


AT|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NNext is suit quality. Let us hear it directly from him.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|No one is saying you should wait for a perfect preempt in order to preempt. If you did, you would be left at the altar forever because perfect preempts, just like perfect occasions, are rare.  What is a 'perfect' preempt? It's a hand with a long strong suit. What do I mean by that? I like to have at least 4 of the top 6 cards. I prefer the suit to be "topless" ' to not have the ace. (^*BMM: ^*NPHonest, I did not inserted the word in quotations. But okay, I added the quotes merely to emphasize its importance -:).) A perfect preempt has little, if any, defense. So the perfect preempt would be a suit headed by QJ109, KJ109, or KQJ10. You want strength in the middle. Also I would like good distribution. I don't want to have 6-3-2-2 or 7-2-2-2 distribution. I want some short suits on the side. 6-3-3-1 with a suit headed by KQJ10 ' lovely. And if you give me a 4-card side suit and even a void, that is nirvana. One more consideration regarding the perfect preempt. I would prefer to have no honors on the side.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


AT|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NNext Mr. Bergen details the flaws in a preempt hand which we should be aware of. And he says, "You will not get a perfect preempt very often. Your hand will have flaws. Your trump suit will have some holes in it. Your outside distribution may be the flattest it could be. The wrong vulnerability is a flaw. It's fine to still preempt, but you would rather have as few flaws as possible. If your primary suit is questionable and you have an outside suit that is very strong, that's a significant flaw. That suggests that maybe your side does not belong in your long suit."|

^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|What happens after 3@D? Let us look at West hand.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


at| The bidding goes as is shown above|lc|D K Q J T 9 6|sk|w|md|0,SAKQJHA Q 9 8D4 CJT86,0,0|NT||lb|*bPlease make a bid for West.^^x|MB|x|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|West has an obvious takeout double.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


sk|n|md|0,0,sTHT7642DA872CAK3,0|NT||lb|*bPlease make a bid for North with this hand.^^5D|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|North has a lovely hand in support of a long diamond suit. Expecting me to  have 7 diamonds, North can follow the Law of Total Tricks by jumping to 5@D. By the way, notice that North has every reason to believe that, if the opponents got to 4@S, unless North could give me a club ruff, there is an excellent chance that 4@S will make. |mb|5D|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|So with this hand, 5@D is a nice 2-way bid. Depending on my hand, if I am short in hearts, we have a chance to make 5@D. And since North is not willing to defend against a 4@S vulnerable game, he bids 5@D.|

PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||sk|w|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|With the West hand, with such a strong hand, I would double again. The second double is not a penalty double, in that I think of penalty doubles as hands with length and strength in the opponents' trump suit. |mb|x|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|A penalty double says 'Partner, stay out of my way. I have them right where I want them.' But when you make a takeout double and then double again, you are saying you have extra values. You have a strong takeout double. You already said you were short in the opponent's suit. Your distribution did not change halfway through the hand. So your partner is entitled to bid.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||mb|p|sk|e|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|If East had longer spades with better distribution, it would be fine for him to bid 5@S. With the actual balanced hand and rotten spades, he is going to pass, expecting his side to take 3 tricks. It is almost always easier to take 3 tricks on defense than 11 on offense. |mb|pp|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


qx||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|That is why one of the good bridge expressions, one of the good guidelines is that, on most hands, 'the 5-level belongs to the opponents'. This means that, for the most part, you don't bid to the 5-level when the opponents are already at the 5-level.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|West is on lead and leads the @SA.|pc|sa|sk|s|pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|s3|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Upon seeing dummy, he shifts to the @CJ. This is perfectly sensible defense. How should declarer play the hand?|pc|cJ|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


NT|^B@2
When in doubt, develop your side suit. Or phrasing it another way, 'I never met a 5-card suit I didn't like'. Dummy's hearts are very weak but there are 5 of them.  This gives great potential to eventually set up a winner because it is likely that neither opponent holds 5 hearts.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Of course in order to set up such a weak suit, you better have a lot of entries to North. Well North does have a lot of entries. There are winners in clubs and diamonds and spade ruffs.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |

So after winning the club, at trick 3 I lead a heart and lose it.|pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h8|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West will win and presumably lead a second club. East should have encouraged with the @C9 on the first club lead. I win the second club in dummy.|pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c4|

At trick 8, I lead a diamond and win it with dummy's  @DA. This draws the opponents' last trump.|pc|d9|pc|c6|pc|dA|pc|d5|

I ruff yet another heart. This establishes dummy's fifth heart since both opponents are now out of hearts.|pc|h7|pc|s4|pc|dT|pc|hA|
