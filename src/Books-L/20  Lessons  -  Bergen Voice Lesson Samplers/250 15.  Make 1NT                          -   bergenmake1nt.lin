Every 2 months Marty Bergen creates an animated voice lesson which you can play on your computer'PC, Apple, or any device having a browser. We have his permission to produce a movie using one hand from each of his lessons. We think you will find what Mr. Bergen has to say very interesting and useful. 

From his July 2016 lesson titled "How To Make 1NT" and from the promotional material introducing the lesson we have prepared this presentation. Please note it is only a sampler, but it is augmented with several exercise boards with 1N contract. For further information about Mr. Bergen's voice lessons, click this |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/audiolessons/mbaudiolessons.php^*N|CP||AT| link.

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|A 1NT contract is one of the most common in bridge. However, when you have limited assets and the opposition gets to choose the first suit to be played, taking the majority of the tricks is often easier said than done. Fortunately, as these deals will illustrate, good technique can prevail.|

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|After winning the first trick with your spade king, do not make the normal, instinctive play of leading the diamond queen.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Instead, lead the diamond 5 from your hand and play one of dummy's three intermediate cards.|

PG| ***** 19 ***** |

If you win the trick,|

Then you'll lead a low diamond from dummy, and will be able to either win your diamond queen or dummy's king depending which card East plays.|

On the other hand, if East wins the first diamond with the jack, you are still okay.|

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Some players would not resist showing their very strong 5-card major. What's my advice? 1NT is by far the most descriptive of all 1-level opening bids. You should open 1NT any time you reasonably can. This view is not merely mine. The great majority of experts feel exactly the same.|MB|1n|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT|^B@2
By the way, if you opened 1@S and partner made the likely response of 1NT, what is your rebid? You are really not strong enough for 2NT. That is supposed to show a hand too strong to open 1NT.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Also, if you end up in NT, don't you want to be the declarer so that the lead can come around to your heart, diamond, or club holding? You would prefer not being the dummy and having the opening lead come through you. So I am opening 1NT. That will get passed out.|mb|ppp|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


pc|ht|NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|The opening lead is the @H10. You see dummy is weak. You are happy that dummy has strength in hearts. You would not have liked a minor suit opening lead. And dummy has some spades for you. If spades split, this will be an easy contract to make.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You have a decision at trick one. I am not saying this is a tough decision. But it is a decision.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT||lb|*mWhich one would be your choice?^I Win the opening lead~You duck^1|lb|*mIf you decide not to duck, in which hand do you win the trick? ^Dummy~Hand^2|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|As always, before playing from dummy, think about not only what you should do now but what you need to do later on.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I hope you agree that it would be wrong to duck the first trick. If the opponents shift to a minor, you are going to lose a lot of tricks. You have no stopper in either minor. |sk||
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So clearly you should win the first trick. Where should you win the trick? Usually the answer to that is 'where do I want to be later?" as opposed to "where should I be right now?".|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT|^B@2
What if spades don't split? If West holds jack-fourth of spades behind you, you can't run spades. It doesn't matter what you do at trick 1. But if East has jack-fourth or even jack-fifth, you can finesse against him later on so long as you have an entry to dummy. So clearly you should play low from dummy and win the @HK.|
pc|h2hj|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT|^B@2
East plays the @HJ. You don't care. You have no interest in hearts beyond your 2 winners.|pc|hk|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|A normal player would play a low spade, the @S5. But watch what happens if you do.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


pc|s5s3|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT|^B@2
When you continue with the @SK, West shows out and discards a minor suit card. Do you realize that the spades are now blocked?|
pc|skc2s9s4|

When East plays low, you can play low and successfully finesse against the @SJ.|

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|But you can't get back to your hand to cash your remaining spades.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Let us go back to the second trick when you played the @SA.|up|14|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So when you cash the @SA you must unblock one of dummy's high spades.|pc|s9s3|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now, when you play the @SK and West shows out, there is no problem. You throw dummy's other high spade.|
pc|skc2sts4|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Dummy now has the singleton @S5 remaining. You cross to dummy's @HA.|
pc|h4h7hahq|

NT|^B@2
You lead the @S5 through East's @SJ6. You can finesse the S8 with total confidence.|

NT|^B@2
As you can see, East/West can easily make a diamond part score. |
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I hope you will open 1NT with hands like this one and not worry about the factors and rules that some players think are important. "Well I open 1NT with 5 hearts but not 5 spades" or "I open 1NT with a weak major but I must show a strong major".|

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Do I guarantee that when you open 1NT with a 5-card major you will never miss a fit in your major?|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


at| Of course not.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Anyone who gives you guarantees is blowing a lot of hot air. But opening 1NT with hands like South's is the recommended action. |
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Who needs rebid problems? If you don't tell partner immediately about your 15-17 HCP, there is an excellent chance you won't be able to do so later on.|
