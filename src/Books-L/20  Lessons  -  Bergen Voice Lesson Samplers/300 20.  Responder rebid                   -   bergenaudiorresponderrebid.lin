^-Responder's Rebid

The Key To The Auction

|fp||at|A Marty Bergen Audio Visual Lesson  
^-|fp||cs||cp||ht|o|AT|^k@2    By Marty Bergen BBO nickname mbsez; |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.martybergen.com^*N|CP||ht|p|AT|^b@2
Every 2 months Marty Bergen creates an animated voice lesson which you can play on your computer'PC, Apple, or any device having a browser. I have his permission to produce a movie using one hand from each of his lessons. I think you will find what Marty has to say very interesting and useful. From his lesson titled "Responder's Rebid ' The Key To The Auction" I have selected hand ##8. For further information about Mr. Bergen's voice lessons, click this |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/vulnxw^*N|CP||AT| link. 

This lesson is a dream come true in learning how to respond after partner opens. He gives clear guidelines for almost all occasions. He makes you understand the concept, the most important feature for me, rather than asking you to memorize rules which I usually forget as soon as I finished the subject. To appreciate all that Mr. Bergen has to offer it would be best to experience the entire lesson. It will be well worth your while, and then some! Please click the forward arrow to begin a short introduction followed by the selected hand. All the text are from his lesson's transcript unless when it is headed by the Movie Maker (MM). |

^-{          Responder's Rebid          }
^-|fp||cp||va|4|AT|^B@2^*BMM: ^*NMr. Bergen's audio visual lesson explains the "common thread" to responder's rebid. He explains and I quote, "When responder's first bid is one of a suit, the opening bidder does not know much about his partner's hand. Therefore, at responder's second turn, he must make a descriptive bid. The bottom line is, after a one level response in a suit, the key bid in the auction is ^*Bresponder's rebid^*N."|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NTo set the stage he selects this |ht|i|cs|6|At|^b{|ia|,1dp1hp|at|}|ht|i|at|^J@2auction where you (the responder) are South with partner (the dealer) is North. |
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|As responder you have few information about opener's hand-it is not 15-17 or 20-21 HCP balanced hand and it is not more than 22 HCP.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT| But now responder knows a lot more beside what we had before.
|ht|i|cs|6|At|^b{|ia|,1dp1hp1sp?|at|}|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


ht|l|AT|^B@2
Opener must have at least 4 diamonds. He would open 1@D with a 3-card suit only if he had two 4-card majors and exactly 2 clubs. When opener does not raise hearts immediately, he definitely does not have 4 hearts. Once he denies 4 hearts, he can't possibly have only 3 diamonds. Since opener did not raise hearts, we are going to assume he has one to three hearts. A void is possible, but voids are always rare. |
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


AT| 

Opener almost certainly has exactly 4 spades. The only time he will have 5 of them is when he also has at least 6 diamonds. 6-5 hands are very rare, and on certain 6-5 hands, if opener has just a minimum opening bid, I would recommend opening the 5-card major before the 6-card diamond suit to make sure opener does not run into reverse problems. |
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


AT|

Further, opener does not have as many as 19 HCP'he did not jump shift to 2@S. However, he could have a very nice hand. Even 17 or 18 HCP is possible. Of course most of the time he will have a nothing special opening bid.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT|

Our last point about inferences from opener's bidding is he will have an unbalanced hand more often than not. The exact odds are 39% balanced and 61% unbalanced. Remember, he did not open 1NT. He did not jump to 2NT. |
PG| ***** 8 ***** |

^C@2They are Pass, 1N, 2@D (raising the opener's suit), 2@H (raising his own suit), and 2@S (raising opener's second suit. 2@C is 4th suit forcing and considered a strong bid. Responder showing a weak hand.|

^B@2^*BResponder's Invitational bids:^*N
^C@2With an invitational strength hand responder has 5 realistic actions. They are 2N, 3@C, 3@D, 3@H, and 3@S. Again on this auction, 2@C is 4th suit forcing.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NBTW, 2@C rebid by responder in this auction is 4th Suit Forcing. And if the auction was 1C-1H-1S then the 2@D would be 4th Suit Forcing. Passes by opponents have been omitted.|

^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|When I picked up this hand, I really liked it. 5-5 distribution doesn't happen often enough for me. You only get it about 4% of the time. A void ' that is wonderful. Having all my strength in my 2 longest suits is always a significant upgrade.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|When I have at least 5-4 distribution with all my strength in my 2 longest suits, I always add 1 HCP to the value of my hand. The quality club suit is another plus 1. So this is an obvious opening bid if I had been the dealer, and it is not a minimum hand. For example, if my partner had given me a limit raise after I opened 1@H, it wouldn't be close.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Of course I would go on. My partner opened which is usually a good sign, although when he bids my void that is not so great. Of course I responded 1@H. Opener now bids 1@S, my shortest other suit. Now I am very concerned this is a misfit. So although I have an opening bid opposite an opening bid, without knowing if opener has any use for hearts or clubs, I am not going to insist on game.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT||lb|*bWhat do you do?^^3C|mb|3c|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|The bid I am going to make is 3@C, which is one of the invitational jump bids that responder could make. 5 jumps are invitational ' 2NT and 3 of each of the 4 suits'3@C, 3@D, 3@H, and 3@S. If you are too strong to invite then you bid 4th suit forcing to game. |

^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|But now that I am concerned about a misfit, I am not going to insist on game. I am content to show my clubs with my 3@C bid, promising at least 5-5 distribution with 2 nice looking suits and not forcing to game.|

^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Before we start playing, it is OK to look at what is going to happen on defense. But let's think before playing. On this kind of hand, even though you are in a suit contract, you must count winners. It would not be helpful to count losers. How many of your hearts are you going to lose? Potentially quite a few. |
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|So let's count winners, which is usually the case in a hand with a lot of ruffing, particularly when you only have a limited number of trump. Counting winners is often the right strategy in a part score where you don't have as much ammunition as in a game or slam.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|We can certainly win 4 club tricks in our hand. Other than the @CA, our clubs are all good. The @HA makes 5 tricks. The @SAK brings us up to 7 winners. Ruffing a heart in dummy could bring us to 8 winners. What other hopes are there? Is it possible the @HQ will become a winner? It's possible but not very likely. |
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Is it possible we can set up a trick in spades if their spades divide 3-3? Yes. If we knew the spades were 3-3 (which is not the case as you will see later), after winning the club in our hand, we could ruff a heart and then just give up a spade. There would be nothing the opponents could do to stop us. But nobody likes to rely on 3-3 splits, and you will see that does not work on this hand.|

^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Can we do better? This is a very difficult hand. My hint for you is diamonds can be everyone's best friend on occasion.

^-|fp||cp||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Responder's 2nd bid is the real key to the auction. After responding at the 1-level, not much is known about responder's hand. In fact, since opener's rebid is not forcing, a pass is sometimes the appropriate action for responder.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


AT|

Responder has a lot to think about at his 2nd turn, not merely evaluating his own hand on its merits for strength, distribution, suit quality, etc., but also keeping in mind what responder has learned about opener's hand. When opener bids 2 suits, there is a real chance that opener has an unbalanced hand and may hate responder's suit. That is not always the case for sure. But it is a possibility.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


AT|
 
And when responder doesn't have a fit for opener, he should proceed carefully. As opposed to when he has a fit, it is perfectly OK to be aggressive. But good judgment and good hand evaluation are always the keys for responder to try to make the correct rebid.|
