^-What You Must Know About Jacoby 2NT

|fp|2|at|A Marty Bergen Audio Visual Lesson  
^-|fp||cs||cp||ht|h|AT|^k@2    By Marty Bergen BBO nickname mbsez; |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.martybergen.com^*N|CP||ht|i|AT|^b@2
Every two months Marty Bergen and Howard produce an animated voice lesson. Using any computer with a browser (PC, Mac, iPad, etc.) you can hear Marty speak for several hours and thoroughly cover his topic. Not only does he discuss the basics, but he includes many "secrets of the experts" as well. I have found these movies very useful and enjoyable. If you are interested in finding out more about these lessons, go to their web site |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/audiolessons/mbaudiolessons.php^*N|CP||AT|. Note that the web site includes some free examples with some interesting bridge puzzles that Marty has created.

I have permission from Marty and Howard to use one example from each lesson to produce a bridge movie. This sampler will give you the flavor of the material that Marty presents and demonstrate his excellent teaching style.

In this movie I chose an example hand from the lesson entitled What You Must Know About Jacoby 2NT. In the lesson Marty gives a detailed explanation of the Jacoby 2NT convention. He explains when it should be used, what opener's rebids are, and the follow ups after opener's rebid. He includes important points regarding hand evaluation and slam bidding. He also discusses splinter bids and when they should and should not be used.

The example I have chosen is Hand 3 from the lesson. It provides two alternative auctions that an expert pair might use. The auctions start with a Jacoby 2N bid and allow the pair to reach an excellent 6S contract despite having only 25 HCP between the two hands. Marty uses the hand to illustrate many important bidding and hand evaluation principles.|ht|y|at|^B@2

PG| ***** 4 ***** |


sk|s|NT||lb|*bWhat should be the bid?^^4c|NT|^B@2
And now I confess on this hand it would be OK with me to bid 4@C.|MB|4cp|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I am not sure this is a minimum hand after a Jacoby 2NT response. 5-5 hands are always attractive. By the time we add our extra points here and there, this hand gets to be pretty nice.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Before I even counted the hand, when I just looked at it, I remembered the following guideline that I think is easy and important. Any time you have a 2-suited hand, with at least 9 cards in the 2 suits, and all your strength is concentrated in those 2 suits (as opposed to in your short suits), you should add 1 point to the value of your hand.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


NT|^B@2
And even 1 point might not be adequate. Hands with long strong suits, whether they be quality suits with at least 3 honors or not, will allow you to take more tricks than you would have thought based on your point count. If the hand turns out to be a misfit, then that is a problem.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Fortunately, although misfits are very annoying, they do not occur that often. Obviously, once responder bids 2NT, we know this hand is not a misfit.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So let's get a count of opener's hand. 11 HCP, 1 point for the values concentrated in the 2 long suits, 1 point for the fifth spade, 1 point for the fifth club, so the starting total is 14. Now that partner supports my spades, I get 2 points for the singleton and 1 point for the long side suit. I am up to 17 points.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Don't lose sleep about the exact number. It is the overall concept that is key. So this is not a minimum hand. And I do have 2 1/2 quick tricks – that's a good thing. I will do the auction with the 4@C jump that most players would make. And then I will do the auction again with a 3@H shortness rebid by opener. So let's continue with the auction that starts 1@S-2NT-4@C. |
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT||sk|n|lb|*bWhat should be the bid?^^4d|NT|^B@2
Responder likes the fact that opener has 5 clubs headed by the @CA Q. To make the jump to the 4-level, you should have at least two of the top three honors in your side suit. Responder is interested but he does not have a heart control. So all he can do for now is control bid 4@D and await developments.|MB|4dp|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


NT||sk|s|lb|*bPlease bid for South^^4h|NT|^B@2
Opener is delighted to hear about the diamond control. He should show his heart control, which turns out to be very economical. So he bids 4@H.|MB|4Hp|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT||sk|n|lb|*bWhat should be the bid by North?^^4n|NT|^B@2
Now responder thinks “Ok, we're cooking. I know opener has the @CA Q. I know he has a heart control. As long as he has the @SA, slam is going to be easy. We can discard my losing diamond on the fifth club.” So responder should
bid 4NT.|MB|4NP|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


sk||NT|^B@2
For the purpose of this lesson, I will assume 1430 Roman Keycard responses because that is what most players use. Of course, with this particular hand, whether you play 1430 or 3014 or traditional Blackwood, opener will bid 5H.|MB|5h|AN|2 keycards no trump Queen|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


mb|p|NT|^B@2
And now responder bids 6@S. And we are going to look at the full board.|MB|6sppp|

The contract is easy. You win the diamond lead. Draw trump. Run your clubs and discard dummy's last diamond. All you lose is one heart trick. |

^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|What happens if the auction begins 1@S-2N-3@H? A rebid of 3@H is a very reasonable thing to do even with the strong clubs. Now responder is extremely interested in slam. A singleton heart takes care of his one weak suit. So at this point, I would make an economical 3@S bid. |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It would not be crazy to bid 4@C as a control bid. But another bidding principle that I believe in is “When in doubt, make the cheapest reasonable bid.” You are allowing more room for partner to tell you about his hand. |mb|3sp|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So, as North, I would bid 3@S over 3@H. Opener will bid 4@C to show a club control. Since responder has the @CK, he knows opener has the @CA. As responder, the singleton heart did so much for my hand that I could bid 4NT now. But what's my hurry? |mb|4cp|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So over 4@C North would simply control bid 4@D. North is hoping his partner can bid 4@H. If he can, that would be awesome. Once you show a short suit, whether over Jacoby 2N or with a splinter bid, the only time you should bid that suit again is with a void. |mb|4dp|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A singleton ace is not special enough to call for a second control bid. If you have a singleton ace and get to show your singleton, fine. Then if partner bids 4NT, you can show your ace with your Blackwood response. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But do not control bid the singleton ace suit again. The second control bid in a short suit should be reserved for voids. If opener has a heart void, can you picture with responder's hand that a grand slam is very possible even if opener does not have a big hand?|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On this hand, opener cannot bid 4@H. Opener does not have a terrific hand and does not want to force to the 5-level. So as opener I would just bid 4@S. This is not a sign off. It simply says “I can't do anything more. I deny a
big hand.” |mb|4sp|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But responder, who already knows about the singleton heart and the @CA, is strong enough to bid 4NT. The auction will continue as in our prior auction. |mb|4np|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We are going to get to 6@S and make it. With only 25 HCP between the two hands, I believe that this is a slam that many pairs would not get to unless they had a good Jacoby 2N auction and appreciated the nice fit of these two hands.|mb|5hp6sppp|
