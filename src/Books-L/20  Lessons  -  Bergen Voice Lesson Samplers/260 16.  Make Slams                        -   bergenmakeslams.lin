^-How To Make Your Slams

January 2016

|fp||at|A Marty Bergen Audio Visual Lesson  
^-|fp||cs||cp||ht|m|AT|^k@2    By Marty Bergen BBO nickname mbsez; |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.martybergen.com^*N|CP||ht|n|AT|^b@2
Every 2 months Marty Bergen creates an animated voice lesson which you can play on your computer'PC, Apple, or any device having a browser. I have his permission to produce a movie using one hand from each of his lessons. I think you will find what Marty has to say very interesting and useful. From his January 2016 lesson titled "How To Make Your Slams" I have selected Board one. For further information about Mr.. Bergen's voice lessons, click this |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/audiolessons/mbaudiolessons.php^*N|CP||AT| link. 

The Movie Maker could not help himself not making a few changes and add a few comments. Please click the the blue "Next Page" top left to continue.

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|South has 14 HCP and his 7-2-2-2 distribution is not what he would like. But when a 7-card suit is given good support, you can add 5 length points. So South has a really nice hand and is optimistic about slam. He bids 3@H to show a strong opener without a singleton.|mb|3H|

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|When North bids 5@H to show 2 key cards, you know that 1 key card is missing. So you settle for 6@H.|mb|6HPPP|

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at| West leads the @S10. South is in a good contract. He has a spade discard on which to throw one of his potential minor suit losers. He is looking pretty good. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|Not sure I copy. As my luck usually betrays me, I am almost sure the trumps are not divided 1-1 and I have a trump loser'@HK. Further, I have no clue how to guess right and make two winning finesse in minors. So I could have 2 losers in the minors'@DK and @CK.|

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Then you surely need this lesson. Let me show you. BTW, you also need to review the tutorial on Endplays by Howard Schutzman'my comrade-in-arms.

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|After winning the first trick with the @SA,|pc|s2s3sa|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You will lead a heart to the @HA hoping that the 2 missing hearts are divided 1-1. That would make the slam a lay down.|

PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Unfortunately, the trumps are not 1-1 (West holds the @HKJ) you have a trump loser. |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|I am not questioning your wisdom. But why not finesse? Is there a learning gem here that you did not do the finesse?|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|I see that you really need lessons.-:) With an 11-card fit the odds slightly favor a 1-1 break. So you play for the drop. This is similar in concept as to why you play for the 2-2 break missing the queen. |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Plus on this hand the heart finesse does you no good. Missing the @HK and @HJ you must always lose a heart trick if both hearts are in one hand. There is no way to avoid it. For example, on this hand, if you lead the @HQ West covers with the @HK and his @HJ is good. And if you lead a low heart, West plays the @HJ to force out the @HA and his @HK is good|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Now let me continue. As you mentioned, on the surface it seems like you have an annoying guess as to which minor suit finesse to take. But watch how you can give yourself a great chance to make the slam. You can guarantee that you will make 6@H if either minor suit king is well placed. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|After winning the @HA, declarer takes his 2 spade winners and discards his @D5.|

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Now declarer makes the key play of cashing the @DA. He is void of diamonds.|

PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Now he exits with his heart loser. West is end played.|

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|If West leads a diamond, declarer will win dummy's @DQ. If West leads a low diamond, declarer will play the @DQ.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|If West tries to cash the @DK,|
PC|dkd6d4h6|AT| declarer can ruff and play the @DQ later. |
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Of course,|up|4|at| if West leads a club,|
PC|c2c3cjcq|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


at| then declarer's problems are solved immediately with the free finesse.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|If West could lead another spade, the ruff/sluff would allow South to discard his club loser. The only way the hand would go down is if West led a diamond, East had the @DK, and the club finesse lost. |
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|So the key play is to cash the @DA to void yourself and then throw West in. If you threw West in before cashing the @DA and he led a diamond, you would not know which finesse to take. This is an interesting demonstration of good technique, something to keep in mind for the future.|
