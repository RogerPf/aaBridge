^-Secrets Of Accurate Hand Evaluation
|fp||at|A Marty Bergen Audio Visual Lesson  
^-|fp||cs||cp||ht|g|AT|^k@2    By Marty Bergen BBO nickname mbsez; |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.martybergen.com^*N|CP||ht|h|AT|^b@2
Every 2 months Marty Bergen creates an animated voice lesson which you can play on your computer'PC, Apple, or any device having a browser. With his permission we produced this movie using a sample or two from his March 2017 lesson--Secrets Of Accurate Hand Evaluation. I think you will find what Marty has to say very interesting and useful. For further information about Mr. Bergen's voice lessons, click |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/audiolessons/mbaudiolessons.php,HERE^*N|CP||AT|.|
ht|m|at|Secrets Of Accurate Hand Evaluation is the highest level of Bergen's Hand Evaluation. He outlined the basic in ^*IBetter Slam Bidding with Bergen^*N. Howard Schutzman had his 4 week lesson series on slam bidding on Tuesday January 27, 2009 using the material from that book. The link to those comprehensive lessons are (All text in blue are hyperlink):

On the other hand, you can review three synopses on

Then armed with the knowledge you have gained from the above sources, you can begin his lesson, assuming you will get it, elevating your bridge to a level making you the envy of your peers. Nevertheless, in this presentation you get an appetizer. Ironically the appetizer is the dessert--a huge German Chocolate cake with a strong Turkish coffee.

ht|t|at|^b@2Evaluating your hand before the auction begins is a very important first step. Reevaluating your hand as the auction proceeds is even more important. Most players do not do a good job in this area.^*N|

ht|v|at|^B@2^*BMovie Maker: The entire lesson is concerned with fleshing out (Howard's term) the details of the points presented above. In this mini-lesson Movie Maker will present Marty's discussion about a few of the topics. See the actual lesson for details about the other topics.

^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|The terms upgradeable and downgradeable have nothing to do with whether or not the hand contains a lot of formal HCP.  Upgradeable simply means that the true value is greater than the formal number of HCP.|

ht|c|at|^B@2Example 3:|HT|d|at|^c|ih|pS 5 4 3   H A T 9 8 7   D K T 9 8 7   C|
ht|i|va|6|at|^B@2Example 3 is a very upgradeable hand. It only has 7 formal HCP. But it has great ^*Bdistribution^*N and attractive ^*Blong suits^*N with lovely ^*Bspot cards^*N. The true value of this hand is significantly greater than 7.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


ht|c|at|^lExample 4: |HT|d|at|^m|ih|pS Q J 2   H Q J 3 2   D K Q J   C  Q J 2|

ht|l|at|^B@2On the other hand, Example 4 is very downgradeable. It contains a lot of honor cards and 15 formal HCP. But with no ^*Baces or intermediate cards, no fewer than 8 quacks, and the worst possible distribution^*N, its true value is far less than 15. If you think that I would not ever consider opening a 15-17 1NT with this pile of garbage, you are 100% correct.|

ht|p|AT|^M@2On the other hand, many hands are neither upgradeable nor downgradeable. I think of them as "OK as is". Example 5 falls in this category. It contains 8 formal HCP. There is no reason to upgrade or downgrade this modest hand.|

Every time I pick up a hand, before I count my formal HCP, I form a first impression. After doing this for many years, I do it unconsciously. I consider the following question: "Is my hand upgradeable, downgradeable, or OK as is?"|

^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|After forming a first impression, my next step is to count formal HCP just like a beginner would. Then comes the most important step. I adjust the formal point count to what I think is the hand's true value. I will demonstrate how I do that shortly.|

Using 4-3-2-1 values to represent kings, queens, and jacks is not completely accurate. You need not memorize the following but it is worth mentioning:
* The true value of an ace is 4 1/2 points.
* A king is correct with its assigned value of 3 points.
* A queen is only worth 1 1/2 points.
* A jack is worth 3/4 of a point.
* A ten, like an ace, is an underrated honor. It is worth 1/4 of a point.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |

Without forcing students to use fractions and make counting high card points a complicated process, my practical method to rectify the imperfections of using the traditional values is to suggest the following:
* If your hand contains at least 3 aces or 3 tens, add one HCP.
* If your hand contains at least 3 queens or 3 jacks, subtract 1 HCP.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


ht|o|at|^B@2You should love being dealt aces. Those players who complain about hands with "aces and spaces", such as Example 9,|
ht|p|at|^B@2Example 9: |ht|p|at|^e|ih|pS A 6 5 4   H A 5 3   D 6 3   C A 6 3 2|
ht|p|at|^m@2are announcing their lack of understanding of what bridge is all about. It is nice to have picture cards along with your aces. But any time I get more than my share of aces, I am a very happy camper.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


 


ht|s|at|^m@2On the other hand, holding no aces is never good. Do I subtract a point for that? When there is nothing wrong with the hand I would not subtract although I am disappointed. But when I get a degradeable hand I definitely would make that formal subtraction.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


ht|w|AT|^b@2An expert friend told me a long time ago "It's uncanny how well hands work out when they contain no jacks." He was not saying he prefers holding a deuce to holding a jack. He was just saying that when you pick up a jack and add one point, that often does not accurately reflect the value of the hand. With too many hands, a jack turns out to be a worthless honor. But, obviously, a jack could also be a critical card. If you have a queen and a ten in a 4-card suit, you would be much happier if partner holds the jack rather than not. Every card has its day in the sun.|

^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|The length of your suits matters. You should take it into account before the bidding starts. Look at Examples 17-20.


Example 17: @S K J 4 3   ^H@H 6 2   @D A 5 3   ^L@C K T 3 2
Example 18: @S K J 4 3 2   ^H@H 6 2   @D A 5    ^L@C K T 3 2
Example 19: @S K J 6 4 3 2   ^H@H 6 2   @D A 5   ^L@C K T 2
Example 20: @S K J 7 6 4 3 2   ^H@H 6 2   @D A 5  ^L@C K 10

All of these hands have the same high cards--11 HCP. Example 17 has no suit longer than four cards. Example 18 contains five spades.  Example 19 has six spades. Example 20 includes a 7-card spade suit.|

I hope you know that Hand 20 is the best of the group. Having a long suit is better than having no long suit, and the longer the better. Longer suits help you take more tricks. That's what bridge is all about. How much better are hands with long suits? Traditional thinking says add one point for each 5-card suit (in case you are lucky enough to have more than one). Add two points for a 6-card suit, 3 points for a 7-card suit, and so forth. That is sensible as soon as you pick up your hand.|
