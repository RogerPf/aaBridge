Every 2 months Marty Bergen creates an animated voice lesson which you can play on your computer—PC, Apple, or any device having a browser. I have his permission to produce a movie using one hand from each of his lessons. I think you will find what Marty has to say very interesting and useful. This movie uses hand number 3 from the lesson titled "To Finesse or Not To Finesse" which has 15 hands. For further information about Mr. Bergen's voice lessons, click this |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/vulnxw^*N|CP||AT| link. 

My mini-movie on "To Finesse or Not To Finesse" lesson gives you a small taste of Mr. Bergen's approach and thought process handling the topic at hand. This sample, although representative, cannot do justice to the depth and quality of his overall lesson. In all of his lessons, Mr. Bergen is happy to share the bridge secrets used by the top players, presenting them in his unique easy to understand and humorous style. To appreciate all that Mr. Bergen has to offer, it would be best to get ahold of the entire lesson. It will be well worth your while, and then some!

Please click the forward arrow to begin a short introduction followed by the selected hand. All the text are from his lesson's transcript unless when it is headed by the Movie Maker (MM).|

^-|fp||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|A finesse is a maneuver to win a trick with a card that is not an obvious winner. Many players love to finesse. It's usually simple and supplies immediate gratification – when it works. However, experts don't like to finesse. Why? Finesses lose half the time, and no one gets rich betting on 50-50 propositions. Of course, that doesn't mean you should never finesse. Finessing will always be an important part of bridge.

For each of the following 15 deals, I will explain the initial thinking to help you decide the key question – To Finesse or Not To Finesse.|

^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|North has a terrific hand, particularly in support of spades. He’s very interested in slam; in fact, even seven is possible. So he’ll respond 2NT, and East will pass.|MB|2N|AN|Asking for feature|

sk|s|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Now it’s back to South. First of all, the question is: What is the partnership agreement? If they’re playing Standard, if South shows another suit here, it shows more than a minimum Weak Two bid and suggests a feature in that suit.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


lb|*bPlease make a bid for South/playing feature.^^3s|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|I understand that’s not the phrasing that most people would use, but if you’re playing feature, that’s the right way to look at it. For a vulnerable weak two bid, South definitely has a minimum, so his correct rebid is 3@S.|MB|3S|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|It’s much more important for the Weak Two bidder to let partner know what kind of Weak Two bid he has – whether he’s at the top end or the bottom end (of his point range) – that’s much more important than to talk about a particular side suit.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|If North-South are playing Ogust responses,|UB||at| then since we’re vulnerable, it’s definitely a minimum, and it’s not like South has a bad suit, but considering it’s only headed by the Q-J-T, as opposed to higher honors, I would rebid 3@C, showing a bad suit and a bad hand.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Very relevant in South’s thinking as to what kind of Weak Two bid he has is his distribution; it’s always important to keep in mind that, while it’s great to have a long suit, you must not forget about your distribution in the other suits. |
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Given a 6-card suit, 6-3-2-2 is the flattest you can be in the other suits, which is not good. 6-3-3-1 would be better, 6-4-2-1 would be considerably better. South’s going to bid 3@S if playing feature responses, or 3@C if playing Ogust.|MB|3Cp|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


NT||sk|n|lb|*bPlease make a bid for North.^^6s|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|When it gets back to North, he’s disappointed that his partner has a minimum, but in a sense, it makes his life easier. If South had shown a good Weak Two bid, then North should be thinking about the possibility of seven.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Once South shows a minimum, seven is out, but North’s hand is SO good that he’s got to be in slam after the Weak Two bid, so he should jump to 6@S.|mb|6s|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|If South has as little as the @SKxxxxx, with or without the @SQ or @SJ, as he presumably has, then North can immediately count six spades, one heart, two diamonds, and two clubs for eleven tricks. If South has three diamonds, then North knows he can trump one diamond in dummy for twelve tricks; or, at worst, declarer will have to take a club finesse. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|So six spades has to be a good contract, and that’s what North will bid, and that will end the auction.|MB|ppp|NT||sk|s|MD|0,SK 2HJ T 9 2DJ 7 5 4C9 8 6,0,S-HQ 7 4 3DQ T 6 3 2CQ T 4 2|PC|HJ|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|West leads the @HJ, and declarer is obviously pleased with the dummy. Since South has the @HK, that helps, although the missing @SK is a problem. So now, from South’s point of view counting losers, hearts are fine, diamonds are fine, but declarer has a possible spade loser and a possible club loser. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Both of them offer the potential to take finesses. Of course, as almost all bridge players know, with eleven trumps missing the king, the percentage play is to play for the drop. The finesse is not the percentage play; but, there are other considerations on this hand. Question: Before proceeding, how would you play if you were the declarer? |
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|The @HJ is the lead, and here’s what I would do:|

^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|I’m not touching trump immediately. I now would cash the ace and king of diamonds to strip that suit.|pc|dad3d8d4|

PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|I lead a third round of hearts from dummy and trump it. It doesn’t matter which trump I trump with; all of the North-South trumps are equivalent, other than the ace. So I trump the third heart, not expecting it to be overruffed; the opponents have eight, so there’s no reason to think West started with short hearts|PC|h8h7s6h9|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|And now that I’m back in my hand, I would lead the @SQ|PC|sQ|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NAnd I thought covering honor with honor was an honorable move. Please see Howard's explanation at the end.|

PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|You see the way I set up the hand, West has both spades; so the finesse will succeed. And you may say, “Marty, that’s very convenient to make your point, but it certainly didn’t have to be that way.” And I’ll agree with that.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Now let us see if the finesse had lost to East’s singleton king—changing E/W spades holding next?|

^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|What would have happened if I play the @SQ from the hand and play low from dummy where it loses to singleton @SK?|PC|sQs2s3sk|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at| Because you thoughtfully stripped the hand, East has to give you a trick. He either will lead a club, and when I play last with the @CAKJ, I’ll never lose a trick in that suit. |
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|If he leads back a red card, where you’re void in both hands, you will slough a club from one hand and ruff in the other, and now you don’t lose any club tricks.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|So here’s a hand – and this is a familiar theme in bridge – that yes, you do need to know the right way to play a suit in a vacuum, but on some hands, the proper technique in a suit is not the right way to play a hand – that’s why you always have to think about other suits, and not just focus on one.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^B@2^*BMM: ^*NI knew it all along. I spent so many years to learn how to play a suit in a ^*Ivacuum^*N and now he tells me, "But not on all hands." But what if I am in the vacuum all the time? Please don't send me your answer. I already know it -:). Please click the forward arrow to see Howard's explanation of why on this hand it is wrong to cover the @SQ with the @SK.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|It is often right to cover an honor with an honor. But experts always count out the hand. On this hand, South opened a weak 2, which means he has 6, and there are 5 spades in dummy. So there are only 2 spades out and West has them both. Therefore, partner is void. So covering will merely eliminate the guess declarer has, as to whether to play you for @SKx or play for a 1-1 break. Covering can never gain you a trick. |
