Every 2 months Marty Bergen creates an animated voice lesson which you can play on your computer—PC, Apple, or any device having a browser. I have his permission to produce a movie using one hand from each of his lessons.   

From his recently released Audio Visual lesson titled "Make the Most of Your entries" and from the 15 examples I have selected example 6 because of the match point aspect and how it emphasizes planning and counting winners at trick 1. The selection process, however, was very difficult as all 15 examples had many unique teaching material. In this lesson Mr. Bergen, as usual shares his bridge secrets, presenting them with his unique easy to understand and no nonsense style. To appreciate all that Mr. Bergen has to offer, it would be best to get ahold of the entire lesson. For further information about the lessons, click this |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/vulnxw^*N|CP||AT| link.

^B@2^*BBergen: ^*N|cp||at|When asked what is the most important topic in the play of the cards, the answer that I always give is “managing entries”. On most hands it is very important to have good communication between the two hands. You should be able to get back to a hand later when you need to be there. |
PG| ***** 1 ***** |

This may involve handling your trumps in a flexible way, leaving entries to both hands. It may involve a decision as to where to win a trick when you have a choice. Too many players think about “where do I want to be now?” when the reality is that the more important decision, on the great majority of hands, is where will you need to be later. It is more difficult to think ahead as opposed to taking care of your decision right now, but it is very necessary. |

The hands in this lesson will be played from an IMP point of view. The goal will be to make your contract without thinking about overtricks. On the few hands where you should play differently at Match Points, because overtricks should be part of your consideration, I will make clear how you should change your play. But for the most part, when you are playing bridge, whether Match Point scoring or IMPs (Swiss Teams, Knockout Teams, etc.), the key is to make your contract. Do not think about overtricks.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NPlease plan to make at least the contract before answering the following quizzes. But mind the trip wires -:).|

PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The spade lead gives us a free finesse. If we play dummy's @S10 or @SJ, if West has the @SQ, there is our 3rd spade trick. If East has the @SQ, we will capture it with the @SA and dummy has 2 winning spades. |
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But I hope you would not do this. Remember, we are playing with IMP scoring. We don't want to risk our contract even if it gives us a chance for an overtrick. With Match Point scoring, it would be the @S10 or @SJ. West rates to have the @SQ when he leads the @S4. And it would be nice to win a 3rd spade trick. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But at IMP scoring, you cannot afford to have your @SA knocked out prematurely. You have a sure thing. Because of your nice club intermediates, if you go up with dummy's @SK and work on clubs, you are assured of winning 2 spades, 1 heart, 2 diamonds, and at least 4 clubs. There are your 9 tricks.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So with IMP scoring you rise with dummy's @SK.

Lead a club and finesse.|pc|c4c3c9cq|NT|^B@2
The finesse loses, but you cannot be defeated.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


sk||NT|^B@2 
In fact, since East's @SQ is doubleton, you get rewarded for your good technique by making an overtrick since you end up winning 3 spades after all. But rising with the @SK is how you can ensure making 3NT on this hand. |

^-|FP||CP||CS||AT|^B@2
As we look back over the 15 hands that you have just heard and played, here are some suggestions to keep in mind that will help you when you are playing. One of the key concepts that comes to mind is how much easier it is to make contracts when the strength is evenly divided between the 2 hands. When one hand, whether that hand is the declarer or dummy, has much weaker assets than his partner, playing the hand is usually more difficult. You do want to keep that in mind in the bidding. It is easier to make 3NT with 12 HCP opposite 13 HCP than 20 HCP opposite 6 HCP, even though in the more difficult case you have 1 more HCP. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


AT|

Don't be a “grabber”. Losing your losers early is usually the right strategy. Most players do not duck often enough. When you lead a side suit, use up the honors from the short side first. Most people know that. But that does not apply when a defender leads the suit. |
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


AT|

There are also many occasions in the trump suit where you want to keep entries to both hands for later on. Each situation must be dealt with on its own merits. |
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


AT|

Do not get stuck in the short hand. You must be very careful with blocked suits to make sure you maximize your winners in those suits.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


AT| 

Be aware of your intermediate cards – tens, nines, and even eights. They can make all the difference in the world. Keep that in mind in the bidding. Those cards should affect the bidding since they will affect the play. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


AT|

When you are in no trump and the weaker hand has the suit you want to develop, that is the time when thinking about and preserving entries to the weaker hand is the most crucial. |
