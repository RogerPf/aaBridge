Every 2 months Marty Bergen creates an animated voice lesson which you can play on your computer'PC, Apple, or any device having a browser. I have his permission to produce a movie using one hand from each of his lessons. I think you will find what Marty has to say very interesting and useful. From his lesson titled "Good Splits and Bad Splits" I have selected hand number 2. For further information about Mr. Bergen's voice lessons, click this |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/vulnxw^*N|CP||AT| link.

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|We love hands where our key suits split well. We find it very annoying when we get a bad split in a key suit. That is especially true in trump when sometimes a bad split is fatal. But you want to try to survive bad splits and make the most of good splits.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|The following is worth keeping in mind on all hands. When things look bad, whether because of bad luck or bad bidding, think optimistically. 'What if?' Give yourself a chance. On the other hand, when you are in a contract that looks cold, play devil's advocate. You need to be pessimistic and concern yourself with things going wrong, such as bad splits. Figure out if there is a way that you can survive bad luck rather than complaining about it later on. Certainly subjects such as safety plays should be part of your arsenal.|

mb|1d|lb|*bWest opens 1D. Please make a bid for.^^x|cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Hopefully you would have doubled with the North hand even if vulnerable. Against a minor suit opening, because you are at such a low level, you want to be very aggressive in getting your side into the auction. |
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|There is very little risk at the 1-level. That is not necessarily true against a major suit opening. Now your partner will frequently have to bid at the 2- level. If your partner is weak and your hand is nothing special, this can be a problem.|MB|x|NT||SK|e|lb|*bWhat do you bid with East hand?^^2h|cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|East jumps to 2@H which is a weak jump shift. This is an important tool to be used in competitive auctions by the responder, regardless of whether the opponent has made a takeout double or an overcall.|mb|2h|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|East is showing a weak hand with a 6-card heart suit or possibly even a 7-card suit. The suit does not need to be strong. But you would like to have a suit where you don't have a big problem if partner has a singleton. |
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|The requirements for making a 3-level weak jump shift are obviously stronger, not in terms of high card points, but the suit should be pretty good. Often the suit is 7-cards in length, particularly when vulnerable.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


NT||sk|s|lb|*bWhat do you bid for South?^^4s|cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|After the 2@H bid, South should be content with a jump to 4@S. When the opponents open the bidding in 1st or 2nd seat slam is really unlikely. The only time you should even think about slam is when you have freakish distribution. 6-3-2-2 certainly does not qualify. Everyone passes.|mb|4SPPP|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|You get the @HA lead.|pc|ha|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


AT| That resolves any potential guess we had in hearts since dummy has the @HK and @HJ. Let's count our losers in this suit contract. |
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||hs|nsss|at|Spades are fine. |
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


AT|We only have 1 loser in hearts.|hc|h6|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


AT| We could lose 2 diamonds.|hc|dk3|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


AT| And with the opening bid behind us, the @DA is almost certainly where we would prefer it wasn't. |
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|We have a finesse in clubs and we could lose a trick. With the opening bidder behind us, any finesses that we take through his partner run a real risk of losing. 4 losers in 4 of a major. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||lc|dk3|ls|nsss|cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|What else is new? What is our plan? Well the @HJ is presumably worthless. East almost certainly holds the @HQ. So we are going to have to do something in the minors to ensure that we do not lose 3 minor suit tricks. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


pc|h4h2h6|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|West leads a low heart at trick 2. Of course we go up with the @HK.|
pc|h3hkh5h7|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||lb|*cFrom dummy, which card would you play? Click that card on the right.^^sa^sak97hjc9632d62|
cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Next we lead the @SA. There is no reason not to start playing trump. East plays the @SJ as West follows.| 
pc|sasjs3s2|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||lb|*cWhich card would you play next? Click that card on right^^hj^sk97hjc9632d62|cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|At this point I would ruff dummy's @HJ with a high spade. I want to strip that suit and there is no time like the present.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||
pc|hjhqsqd4|cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|East plays the @HQ, of course, on the @HJ. West throws off a diamond.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||lb|*mWhich suit do you play next?^Clubs~Diamonds~Spades^3|cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|We now play a 2nd round of trump, removing West's last spade. |
pc|sts6s7h8|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Here is how most would play.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT|^B@2
They cash the @CA just in case West had a singleton @CQ although that is very unlikely.|
pc|cac7c2c4|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|They would return to dummy with a trump since we have lots of trump.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


AT| They would then take the club finesse.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


pc|s4d5s9h9|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


pc|c3c5cj|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Playing this way gives you a really good chance to make the contract. Maybe the finesse will win. Even if it loses, when West wins the @CQ, if he is now out of clubs, he is end played and forced to lead a diamond which will set up your @DK. |
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Or maybe West will mistakenly play diamonds. Or maybe the @C10 will fall. For example, East might have started with the ten-doubleton in clubs. That means your @C9 is now a winner. You can get to dummy and throw away a diamond on the @C9. Or clubs may split 3-3. So you have a lot going for you.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|But note that on this hand, clubs split exactly the way that is bad for you.|SK||
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


AT| West has 4 clubs headed by the @CQ and @C10. When West wins the @CQ, he will exit with a club.|
pc|cq|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


pc|c8|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|You are going down. When you lead diamonds, since West has the @DA as expected, you will lose 2 diamonds.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


AT| What is the solution? |
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||qx||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Don't play clubs at all. |up|13|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


at| Make the totally counterintuitive play of leading a low diamond out of your hand. |
pc|d3|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


AT| So let's say East wins the 1st diamond and leads a club, the suit which you have not yet touched when playing correctly.|
pc|d5d2d7|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


pc|c4|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|You win the @CA and lead the @DK. |
pc|cac7c2|

pc|dkdad6d8|cp|8|at|West wins the @DA and is end played.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


pc|dq|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


at| If he leads another diamond, he will give you a ruff-sluff. You will ruff in dummy and throw away your @CJ.|
pc|s9d9cj|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Or he will lead a club.|up|4|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


pc|c8|at| This will be lovely as it comes around to your @CKJ tenace and guarantees you will not lose any clubs.|pc|c3c5cj|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|This is an unusual hand. It is not your normal end play. But because you knew the @DA was held by the opening bidder behind your @DK, if you really work hard and think this hand out, it all makes sense. |
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|It is not an easy hand. Few players would play it correctly. I believe in a normal setting that the only players who would make this hand would do so because of a misdefense.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|This is a really good hand to think about and study. Play it through. Hopefully this is a hand you can learn to make on your own.|up|36|
