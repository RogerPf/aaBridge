2C Auctions
|fp||at|A Marty Bergen Audio Visual Lesson  
^-|fp||cs||cp||ht|h|AT|^k@2    By Marty Bergen BBO nickname mbsez; |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.martybergen.com^*N|CP||ht|j|AT|^b@2Every 2 months Marty Bergen creates an animated voice lesson which you can play on your computer'PC, Apple, or any device having a browser. I have his permission to produce a movie using one hand from each of his lessons. I think you will find what Marty has to say very interesting and useful. The lesson titled "Everything You Need to Know About 2@C Auctions" has 42 examples divided in the following chapters:

A. Should you open 2@C?
B. Responding To 2@C
C. Opener's Rebids After 2@C-2@D
D. Opener's Rebids After 2@C-2@S
E. Responder's Rebids After 2@C-2@D-2NT
F. Responder's Rebids After 2@C-2@D-2@S
G. Responder's Rebids After 2@C-2@D-3@D
H. Opener's 3rd Bid after 2@C-2@D-2@H-3@C
Both Players Are Bidding

Because the topic is very important, we have asked for permission to use more of the material in this lesson and it was granted. However, this is just a sample at best and reviewing the entire lesson should be a must for any aspiring bridge player.

^-|ht|c|fp||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Everyone loves to pick up a big hand. And when the big hand is clearly strong enough to open 2@C, that is better still. However, sometimes the decision as to whether or not you should open 2@C is far from obvious. Additionally, after a 2@C opening bid followed by responder's 2@D waiting bid, the partnership is very much in the dark.|

Responder knows absolutely nothing about opener's distribution at this point. Meanwhile, not only does opener know nothing about responder's distribution, he also has absolutely no idea about the strength of responder's hand. This is certainly not a recipe for success. So auctions involving 2@C openers are frequently far from trivial.|

Technically speaking, one can't disagree. But let's think. With spades as trump, you expect to take 7 spade tricks and 2 diamond tricks with no problem. Yes, spades could split badly. Anything could happen. But if partner has a doubleton diamond and a couple of spades, you will easily make 4@S. |
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


ht|n|va|2|AT|^b@2
The bottom line is that this is a 2@C opener. You don't need a lot from partner to make a slam. The @CAK and @DQ would suffice. Picture the following: Say you open 1@S and partner bids 1NT, their most likely bid. I assume you would jump to 4@S. You don't want to get involved with a phony jump shift. How would you feel if partner really liked diamonds and kept supporting that suit and you ended up not playing in spades? |
PG| ***** 5 ***** |

Over 4@S partner will pass with many hands where you can make a slam. So open 2@C. Keep bidding your spades over and over again. You will end up in 4@S if partner is weak. You have an excellent chance to make that no matter how weak partner is. There is no reason not to open 2@C. You have 4 quick tricks. 'Quick tricks' are the number of tricks you will take on the first 2 rounds of each suit. So the @SAK and @DAK count as 4 quick tricks. |
PG| ***** 6 ***** |

I am going to refer to quick tricks quite often in this lesson. We are happy to open 2@C with a big hand, but only if it has 4 quick tricks. Of course there will be some other thoughts. I certainly am not saying you should open 2@C with all hands that have 4 quick tricks. That would be silly. But I am saying that you should not open 2@C with fewer than 4 quick tricks. Do you need a little review on quick tricks? |

^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Fair enough. It is the number of tricks you take in each suit on the first 2 rounds. Period. So AKQJ is only 2 quick tricks. You can't have more than 2 quick tricks in one suit. |
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


AT|

Ace is one quick trick. KQ is one quick trick. You lead the king, they win the ace, and the queen wins the 2nd round. AQ is 1' quick tricks. Depending on which opponent has the K, you will either win 1 or 2 tricks in the first 2 rounds. So we use 1' as an average. King-small is a ' quick trick. Depending on who has the ace, you may or may not win the first or second round.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


AT|

Those are the only 5 combinations that you can use to count quick tricks. KQJ is not 2 quick tricks. The jack is never 'quick'. It may be useful as a slow trick but not as a quick trick. I count my quick tricks on every hand. It is very easy to do. Keep it in mind. There is a lot more to evaluating your hand than HCP. Hopefully you already know that.|

I am afraid that plenty of bridge players would open 2NT. But that is incorrect. Not because this lesson is about opening 2@C. We will see strong hands where you should not open 2@C. But evaluating this hand as only 21 points in NT is wrong. Why do I love this hand? |
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


ht|r|at|^B@2The 5-card suit. I never saw one I didn't like. And this 5-card suit has 3 honors. Any suit with at least 3 honors and at least 4 cards is a 'quality suit'. That is the term I use. And you should always add 1 point to your hand when you are lucky enough to hold a quality suit. You won't get them as often as you would like. And you should also add 1 point for your 5-card suit. You don't get those on every hand either.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


AT|

So now we are up to 23 points. I am not saying the following results in adding any more points to this hand. But did you notice the intermediate cards? You have 4 intermediates ' the @S10, @H9, @D10, and @D8. Four intermediate cards is a nice number. There are many hands where you don't hold any tens, nines, or eights. |

Jacks are often useless, particularly in slams. How did we do in the quick trick department? 1 in spades (@SKQ), 1' in hearts (@HAQ), 2 in diamonds (@DAK), and ' in clubs (@CK5). That's a total of 5 quick tricks. You might spend many days before you see a hand with 5 quick tricks. That is a superb number. The bottom line is that this is a clear cut 2@C opener. It is a balanced hand.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


LC|skqhaqdakck5|
ht|h|at|^B@2So when partner responds 2@D, as they almost always will (we will get into that more later on), you will rebid 2NT. If partner has nothing, they will pass. Of course they could transfer to a major with a 5-card suit even with nothing. That would suit us just fine with our nice support for both majors. |

The single most important thing that you must do accurately in every auction is hand evaluation. And it is doable. You don't have to be an expert on squeezes to evaluate your hand sensibly. Use the guidelines that I have written about and hopefully you have learned. Many of my guidelines applied to this very upgradeable hand that is far too good to open 2NT.|

'But Marty, you have 22 HCP. That's a lot.' Don't get me wrong. I am not saying this is a weak hand. But of all the hands in the world with 22 technical HCP, this hand is about as bad as it could be. Note no aces. No intermediates. That is never good. How about quick tricks? One each in spades, hearts, and diamonds and only ' in clubs. Only 3' quick tricks. I am not opening 2@C. Not to mention look at the 4 jacks.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


lc|skqhkqdkqckj|ht|t|at|^B@2They are not worth 4 points. Just like with 4 aces, I hope you would not think that is only 16 HCP. Aces are worth more than 4 points and jacks are worth less than 1 HCP. You also have 3 queens. They are not worth 2 points each. Last but not least, 4-3-3-3 distribution. That is the worst distribution you can have. |
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


AT|

This hand is not worth 22 HCP. Ultimately bridge is all about taking tricks. At the end of the hand all you care about is how many tricks you have taken. The number of HCP you had is no longer relevant. So with this pile of garbage (admittedly a big pile) I am opening 2NT. I am not opening 2@C. I don't like this hand even a little bit.|
