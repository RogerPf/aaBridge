^-Forcing or Not?

Baron Barclay Bridge Supply had a recent email marketing blitz for Marty Bergen's audio-visual lessons. |CP|1|AT|^*Hbaronbarclay.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=13e40f6a288c4a7cab47475d3&id=ac575c9d90&e=b0a892ff64^*N|CP||AT| 

I am on their email list and loved their email which came with free examples on the "2 Way Checkback" and the "Best defense" lessons. Along with it I received the transcript for the "Forcing or not?" lesson from Mr. Bergen. Here I have turned the last one into a movie which you can enjoy at your leisure using any popular device such as Windows PCs, Macs, iPads, iPhones, and Android tablets and phones.

For further information about Mr. Bergen's voice lessons, you can also use this |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/audiolessons/mbaudiolessons.php^*N|CP||AT| link.

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Every bridge player must know whether his partner's bid is forcing. In my experience, many players are deficient in this area. Can you prove me wrong? For each example, state whether or not the last bid is forcing. Assume standard bidding. |

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Partnership. In Standard, a new suit by an UPH (unpassed hand) after partner's preempt is forcing. I think this is foolish. I treat all new suits after a preempt as nonforcing.|
