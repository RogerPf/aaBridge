Every 2 months Marty Bergen creates an animated voice lesson which you can play on your computer'PC, Apple, or any device having a browser. With his permission we produced this movie using a sample or two from his January 2017 lesson--Find The Best Line Of Play. I think you will find what Marty has to say very interesting and useful. For further information about Mr. Bergen's voice lessons, click this |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/audiolessons/mbaudiolessons.php^*N|CP||AT| link. |
ht|o|at|The main topics discussed are: 
Give yourself an extra chance to make the hand
Avoid losing finesses
Overcome bad splits
Know what you must about suit combinations
Take advantage of clues from the opponents' auction
Know when (and why) to not follow "8 ever, 9 never"
Know when it's right to go for an endplay, and how to set it up
Execute a squeeze without being proficient on the subject
Know when it's right to play differently at matchpoints.

Next are the samples presented using Howard Schutzman's Viewer APP.

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|You can't avoid losing three aces, so you must avoid your club loser. Before starting to play, to have a chance to play this deal correctly, you must first answer these two important questions:|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


NT|^c@2
Question ## 1: Where should you win the opening lead?
Question ## 2: What suit will you lead at trick two?|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|^B@2

Question ##1 should not be addressed until you answer Question ##2.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|What suit will you lead at trick two?|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You must avoid losing a club, so leading a trump at trick two is 100% wrong. An opponent will win his @SA and lead another club. It will now be impossible to avoid losing a trick in each suit.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Leading a diamond at trick two is a better plan. Dummy's diamond suit is long and strong and offers a chance to avoid losing a club trick.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, when you knock out the @DA, E-W will persist with clubs. You'll then need to discard your last club on dummy's 3rd diamond honor without anyone ruffing. For this to work, you need diamonds to divide 3-3, which is against the odds.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|The correct suit to lead at trick two is hearts. The combined N-S heart holding is not as imposing as the diamonds, but your side's hearts include the same three honors as in diamonds. And since E-W have 8 hearts, neither opponent is likely to be able to ruff one of your winners. Sometimes, less is more.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Where should you win the opening lead?|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
At trick two, you'll apply "Use up the honor from the short side first" and lead the @HJ, and E-W are now helpless. Let us play the first few tricks.|

^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|West is the dealer and opens 1@s. That surprises you with your 19 HCP. The next two players pass. So you are in the balancing seat. What should you bid? A lot of players would simply double and think later. But in fact there is a better bid.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT|^B@2
When you jump to 2NT in the balancing seat as an unpassed hand, that is natural. It is similar to opening 2NT, roughly 19-21 HCP, with at least one stopper in opener's suit.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That bid is standard for experts. It is more important to define it that way than as an Unusual 2NT. When an opponent opens on your right and you have no information about the hands of the other 2 players, it is very unlikely that you would have this strong a hand. |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But after an opening bid on your left followed by 2 passes, which means responder is very weak, it is not nearly as unlikely that you would have a very good hand.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So you bid 2NT. Your partner is welcome to use Stayman or transfers. This is a "front of card systems on" situation. On this deal your partner bids 3NT. That's good. If partner had passed and tabled a Yarborough, you would have no chance to make 2NT.|MB|P3NPPP|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The opening lead is the expected @sQ.|PC|sQ|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You see that partner is far from broke with 9 HCP and a useful 5-card club suit. So how will you play this hand? You only have 5 fast winners, 2 spades|HC|SAK|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


AT| and 3 hearts|HC|HAKQ|AT|. |
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT|^B@2
There is no hope for additional tricks in the majors. So you have to figure out how to win 4 tricks in the minors.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


lc|SAKHAKQ|NT|^B@2
You know that West has at least 5 spades and both minor suit aces. You can't afford to lose the lead twice. West got to make the opening lead and started working on spades before you were able to work on your minors. It doesn't matter whether or not you hold up at trick 2. |
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You know where all the defenders' strength is. So you win the first spade.|

lb|*mWhich minor do you lead now?^Clubs~Diamonds^1|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|As you will see playing diamonds first gives you no chance to make the hand? West will win the @DA and lead another spade. You will win 3 diamond tricks in addition to your 5 major suit winners. But you will never get your 9th trick in clubs. Let us play it that way.|

"Is it important?". you may ask. Let us try @CK first and see what can happen.|

^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Now you're fine. You are up to 6 tricks, your 5 major suit winners and the club you just won. Playing diamonds assures you of the 3 additional tricks you need to make your contract.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So the key is to lead the low club based on the fact that you know West holds the @CA. That means West can't defeat you whether or not he goes up with his ace. |
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The colorful term for this play is a "Morton's Fork Coup" |CP|1|AT|^*Hen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morton%27s_fork_coup^*n|CP||AT|. 

Regardless of the term, the low club represents excellent declarer technique.|
