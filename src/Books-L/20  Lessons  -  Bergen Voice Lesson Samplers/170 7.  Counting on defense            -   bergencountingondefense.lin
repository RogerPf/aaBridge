Released May 2017

Every 2 months Marty Bergen creates an animated voice lesson which you can play on your computer'PC, Apple, or any device having a browser. We have his permission to produce a movie using one hand from each of his lessons. We think you will find the "Counting On Defense" very interesting and useful. For further information about Mr. Bergen's voice lessons, click this |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/audiolessons/mbaudiolessons.php^*N|CP||AT| link. 

In this presentation we changed the format by describing what and how we learned from the lesson. Please click the "Next Page" to continue. |

^*BMovie Maker: North/Sout have reached a 4@H contract and you need to pick the opening lead with defeating it in your mind. Let us look at each suit. Leading from spades and hearts are out. Howard always recommends not leading unsupported aces or underleading an ace.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*BWe have a reasonably respectable club sequence. Most bridge teachers recommend selecting top of a sequence as a good opening lead. Further, the diamonds are so weak that we can ignore them. So let us lead @CJ. "But aren't you forgetting something important Movie Maker?" Sez Mr. Bergen.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


NT||at|^B@2
^*BMovie Maker: You are spot on Mr. Bergen. We forgot to pay attention to the bidding. Forgive our bridge clumsiness.  Let us review the bidding carefully as you have outlined in your lesson. We will undo all and start with the opening bid.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


NT||ub|13|at|^B@2
^*BMovie Maker: 1@D bid by North means he has an opening hand of 12+ with no four cards in either spades or hearts. He, probably, has four diamonds. He does not have strength and distribution to bid either one or two NT. Further he does not have a 2@C opener.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


NT||mb|p1h|at|^B@2
^*BMovie Maker: Quick, what is the 1@H bid by South tells us?|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


AT| He has 6+ points with 4+ hearts. May have 4 spades but not five. South could have four diamonds. We are going to pass and see what North will do.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |

^*BMovie Maker: So North has four spades, four diamonds. Does not have four hearts--probably three hearts.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||mb|2dp|at|^B@2
^*BMovie Maker: Now we are learning more. "South's 2@D preference showed a weak hand and did not promise a lot of diamonds. South would have liked to have 4 diamonds but might have been forced to take a preference with only 3 diamonds."|

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|North's jump to 3@H is the really interesting bid. Clearly North has 3 hearts. He would have supported hearts immediately with 4. So you know that North has 4 spades and 3 hearts. He must have a very strong hand.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


NT|^B@2
South could have a weak hand with 4 hearts, so jumping to 3@H promises a really nice hand. North must have an unbalanced hand to bid this way. North would have opened 1NT with a balanced 15-17 or jumped to 2NT with a balanced 18-19. |
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Therefore North must have a singleton or void in clubs and at least 5 diamonds. Based on the 2@D preference, North/South must hold at least 8 diamonds between them. You have 4 diamonds. So you know that your partner has at most 1 diamond.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now let's count the hearts. South went on to 4@H even though 3@H was not forcing. South must have 5 hearts to accept the invitation when he knows from the bidding that North only has 3 hearts. Since North-South have 8 hearts and you have 2 hearts, your partner has 3 hearts. |

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Do you see that the normal @CJ lead or the possible @SA lead are both heading in the wrong direction? You know your partner has 3 hearts and at most a singleton diamond. The correct lead is a diamond. Since you are leading diamonds hoping partner can ruff, you should lead the @D8 as suit preference.|sk||

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Picture what will happen in the play. Let's say partner has a singleton diamond. Declarer wins the diamond and leads a trump. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|4@H is down 1, declarer losing 2 aces and 2 diamond ruffs. In fact, I would have doubled 4@H. I can figure out from the bidding that partner has 1 diamond and 3 hearts. So here is a hand where, from the bidding, you can count their distribution. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You know they are not going to make it so long as you lead a diamond. You get a nice plus score for your sensible opening lead based on counting their distribution.|
