Every 2 months Marty Bergen creates an animated voice lesson which you can play on your computer-PC, Apple, or any device having a browser. With his permission, from his May 2016 lesson titled "Active Defense vs Passive Defense" I have selected two hands and a few of his "words of wisdom." For further information about Mr. Bergen's voice lessons, click this |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/audiolessons/mbaudiolessons.php^*N|CP||AT| link.|

In this lesson, Marty will discuss the following:
 -- The great benefits of counting declarer's distribution and winners
 -- "Last is best", "first is (often) worst"
 -- How to take advantage of knowing something that declarer doesn't
 -- When to say "NO" to second-hand low
 -- The right time to take your ace of trump
 -- The right time to false card
 -- The right (and wrong) time to try to give partner a ruff
 -- When should you be unwilling to lead "around to weakness."
 -- How to understand and execute surrounding plays|

^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Some deals call for active defense. On these, you must be aggressive in trying to set up or cash winners, attack an entry, etc. Active defense usually involves breaking new suits and hoping partner has the right cards.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|

On the other hand, on many deals the best approach for the defenders is to be passive. In bridge, "passive defense" should NOT be regarded as a negative term. Unless you have a sequence, or are leading a suit where partner has promised length and/or strength, there are infinite situations where breaking a new suit will hand declarer an extra trick in that suit.|

I hope you are ready to count. Even if your instincts are very good, it is impossible to defend well without ^*Bcounting^*N. What should you count?|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


AT| 

Look at the high card points between you and dummy to help you zero in on what declarer and partner has. When declarer has made a well defined bid, such as opening 1NT, you should be able to figure out a lot about partner's hand. You must also try to count distribution. Very often declarer's bidding gives good clues as to his distribution. You also should ask yourself about the number of winners and losers for both sides. On some hands this is easier than on others.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


AT|

Of course the common thread to all good defense is thinking and counting. Without those good defense is impossible. Even if you have very good instincts, defense is not the time to rely on them.|

^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|There is no reason to lead spades. If declarer has spade losers, he can't possibly get rid of them. Therefore, this is the right time for passive defense.  At trick 2, punt by leading a club.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This is safer than leading a trump in case partner has the doubleton queen. Declarer wants to lead twice towards his @S Q 10 7. But as long as you never lead spades, his one entry to dummy will cause him to lose three spade tricks.|pc|c8|

^B@2^*BMarty Nergen: ^*N|cp||at|Let's count high card points. You have 9 (you played @HA and @DQ) and dummy has 9 for a total of 18. Declarer has at least 15 meaning partner has at most 7. You know that partner has no strength in the red suits. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The problem is your spades. Even if partner has some strength in spades, because you can't beat any of dummy's spades, this means your side must get some tricks in clubs. So you should lead a club. But leading the @C8 will not suffice. And leading the @CQ will not defeat the contract either. |
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The only possible way to establish 2 club tricks for your side, so long as your partner has the @CK, is to make the "surrounding play" of leading the @C10. Now, even if declarer has the @C9, your side can get the 2 club tricks it needs to defeat the contract. |
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Watch what happens when you lead the @C10.|pc|ct|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Declarer will probably play the @CJ.|pc|cj|at| This is necessary if you were leading the @C10 with no higher honor and your partner held both the @CQ and @CK. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In that case, declarer's @C9 prevents the defense from being able to lead another club to establish a 2nd club trick.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On this hand it doesn't matter whether or not declarer plays the @CJ. If declarer plays the @CJ your partner wins the @CK.|

PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That is not obvious, but your partner should also be counting points and be able to figure out that you don't have the @CA. |
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You have already shown up with the @DQ, the @DJ (leading @D promises holding @DJ), and the @HA. If you held the @CA, declarer would not have enough points to open 1NT. |NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|This hand requires excellent defense from both partners. Your only chance to beat 4@H is to get 2 club tricks. |
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Regardless of how declarer plays the spades, he will only lose 1 spade trick because your partner started with king-jack doubleton. He will be able to discard a club loser on a spade unless the defense can take 2 club tricks before spades are set up.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The surrounding play of leading the @C10 is a nice play. Surrounding plays are a lot of fun and kind of sexy.|up|14|
