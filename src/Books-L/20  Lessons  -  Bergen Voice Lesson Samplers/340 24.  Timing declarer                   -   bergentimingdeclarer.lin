^-Timing Is Everything - Declarer

|fp|2|at|A Marty Bergen Audio Visual Lesson  
^-|fp||cs||cp||ht|h|AT|^k@2    By Marty Bergen BBO nickname mbsez; |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.martybergen.com^*N|CP||ht|i|AT|^b@2
Every two months Marty Bergen and Howard produce an animated voice lesson. Using any computer with a browser (PC, Mac, iPad, etc.) you can hear Marty speak for several hours and thoroughly cover his topic. Not only does he discuss the basics, but he includes many "secrets of the experts" as well. I have found these movies very useful and enjoyable. 

If you are interested in seeing a demonstration lesson, click here |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/dngcdx^*N|CP||AT|. Note that the web site includes some free examples with some interesting bridge puzzles that Marty has created.

I have permission from Marty and Howard to use one example from each lesson to produce a bridge movie. This sampler will give you the flavor of the material that Marty presents and demonstrate his excellent teaching style.

In this movie I chose an example hand from the lesson entitled "Timing Is Everything - Declarer." In this sampler Marty presents his excellent teaching style particularly for those who wish to excel in declaring. He also has "Make The Most Of Your Entries", "How To Play 3NT", "Drawing Trump - All, Some, or None", and "To Finesse or Not To Finesse" which all are superb for improving the declaring skill.  

Hand 2, my pick for this movie, is a simple 2N contract which requires two critical plays at the right timing to assure the success of the contract. I have, further, used the Movie Maker's prerogative to add to its challenge and sharpen your focus. At first you are quizzed about the bidding followed by asking you to make your plan to make the contract and make those critical moves without being able to see the opponents' hands. Then after reading his instructions you can play the board double dummy. ^*BOh I wish I could do this to all 15 boards. But then I would be out of my day time job -:).^*N|ht|y|at|

lb|*bWhat should North bid?^^1d|cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|North opens 1@D to avoid a potential rebid problem. Holding 4 diamonds and 5 clubs and not enough strength to reverse, if my diamonds are strong, I prefer opening 1@D to give me the opportunity to rebid 2@C and avoid having to reverse.|mb|1dp|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Opening 1@D with 4 diamonds and 5 clubs is one area where Marty and I disagree, that is fine. I open 1@C because if you open 1@D with 4 diamonds and 5 clubs, when it goes 1@D-P-1@H or 1S-P-2C-P-? partner will often have no idea whether to stay in clubs or go back to diamonds. Opener could have 5 diamonds and 4 clubs or 4 diamonds and 5 clubs and responder has no idea which. Having said that, if there were any hand where I might consider opening 1@D with 4 diamonds and 5 clubs, this would be the hand (with such bad clubs and nice diamonds). And many experts agree with Bergen.|

NT||lb|*bWhat should North bid?^^2c|cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|North then bids 2@C as planned. South has enough to rebid 2NT to invite game. North, with a minimum, has an obvious pass.|mb|2CP2NTPPP|

Not surprisingly, the opening lead is in the unbid spade suit.|PC|S3|SB|wNow I am gone -:).|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NStart you plan to make the contract. First let us count the sure winners.|sb|W|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


NT||lb|*mHow many sure winners do you have?^4~5~6~7^2|cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|You start with 5 obvious immediate winners ' 2 clubs, 2 diamonds, and 1 spade.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT||lb|*mWhich suit could be the source of your additional tricks?^Clubs~Diamonds~Hearts~Spades^3|cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|The 3 additional tricks must come from hearts. Fortunately you have all the relevant spot cards in hearts. Other than the @HA and @HK, you are solid in the suit. Hearts is a wonderful suit to develop.|

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|And now your hearts are dead. Your only entries to set up the hearts are the @CA and @CK. You must make sure those entries are saved for later. If one of your entry cards is played prior to your playing a heart trick, you will not be able to set up and run your hearts.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So the correct play at trick one is to win the @SA so as not to give East a chance to shift to a club.|UP|7|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You do have a guaranteed spade stopper. It is not like you are opening up the spade suit for the opponents. But even if you did not have a guaranteed spade stopper, you cannot risk a fatal club shift.|PC|SA|PC|S2|PC|S4|

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|When East plays low, you must make the second key play by overtaking with your @HQ. |PC|hq|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|If you play a low heart from your hand, if West holds up winning his @HA, you no longer have the entries to set up and run the hearts. So you must overtake the @HJ with your @HQ. Now you don't care what West does. |
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Let's suppose West wins the @HA, although it doesn't matter.|PC|ha|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Whatever he returns, you are OK. If he continues spades, the defense is not going to be able to run that suit. You still have the @CA and @CK. You will get to your hand with one of your club entries and play another heart to knock out East's @HK. You still have your other club entry to return to your hand so that you can take the heart tricks that you have established.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|You had to make the two early key plays. The timing had to be perfect. You must play the @SA at trick one to prevent the killing club shift. You then must overtake the @HJ with your @HQ in order to ensure you have enough entries to establish and run your hearts. If you make those plays, your 2NT contract is safe. You will always win 3 heart tricks in addition to your 5 winners in aces and kings.|
