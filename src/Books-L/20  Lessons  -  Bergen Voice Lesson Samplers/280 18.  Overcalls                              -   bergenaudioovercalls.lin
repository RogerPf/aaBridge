Effective Overcalls

|fp||at|A Marty Bergen Audio Visal Lesson  
^-|fp||cs||cp||ht|m|AT|^k     By Marty Bergen BBO nickname mbsez; |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.martybergen.com^*N|CP||ht|o|AT|^B@2^*BMM: ^*NEvery 2 months Marty Bergen creates an animated voice lesson which you can play on your computer'PC, Apple, or any device having a browser. I have his permission to produce a movie using one hand from each of his lessons. I think you will find what Marty has to say very interesting and useful. From his lesson titled "Effective Overcalls" I have selected hand ##25'there are 25 hands in the lesson. For further information about Mr. Bergen's voice lessons, click this |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/vulnxw^*N|CP||AT| link. 

Mr. Bergen's audio visual lesson covering "Effective Overcalls" has an excellent introduction from which I bring you a summary. However, this lesson is a ^*IDYNOMITE^*n. It is Bergen at his best. You know nothing about overcalls and takeout doubles unless you read the entire lesson several times. One of his many gems'not included here'is Equal-Level Conversion Doubles or ELCD. Without a doubt this mini-movie cannot do justice to the depth and quality of his lesson. Read it all and you will be a menace to your bridge circles. Well, MM already has been a menace for a long time -:). Please click the forward arrow to begin the sampler. |

^-|fp||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Knowing what to do when your right-hand opponent (RHO) opens is crucial. On 50% of the deals you play, the player who opens the bidding is your opponent. When that opponent is your RHO, the player in the hot seat is you. When your side opens the bidding, high card points (HCP) play a very significant role in your decision making. But things are very different when the enemy bids first. When your RHO opens, HCP are no longer the key. Level, distribution. Vulnerability and suit quality, as well as your holding in RHO's suit, are much more important.|

In this lesson I will discuss:
' Why you should be super-aggressive when your RHO opens 1@C
' When to pass a strong hand
' Very flexible takeout doubles
' 1-level overcalls ' all you need there is a reason
' 1NT overcalls ' very, very descriptive bids
' 2-level overcalls ' a 6-card suit is the norm
' 2-suited overcalls ' why some are better than others
' Jump overcalls ' how aggressive should you be|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |

The only overcall that is defined by high card points is 1NT. Therefore, many players are uncertain about the requirements for overcalls and takeout doubles. The material presented here will definitely help you clarify these issues. Do all bridge experts agree with all of my suggestions? Of course not. However, regardless of your bridge level, the contents of this presentation will be very helpful in your future bidding.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |

When the opponent opens 1 of minor, you want to be very aggressive. It is ok to make a takeout double without a perfect holding in the other minor because your partner is so likely to respond in a major. Those are the important suits. It's even ok to make a takeout double with 3 or 4 cards in the opponent's minor. You want to get in when you can with a decent hand, and you will never have a cheaper opportunity than when an opponent opens 1 of a minor. Takeout doubles are an excellent flexible action.|

^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|The one time when you don't want to make a takeout double, when that option is available, is when you have a 5-card major and a normal strength hand. You want to overcall with those hands in one of a major. That will be the best way to show partner you've got 5. If you make a takeout double, you can't show your 5-card major later, unless you have a big hand, because showing your major later would promise a big double.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NBergen then goes on to describe all the other common scenarios regarding when and how to overcall. This is great information that you will get when you go through the entire lesson. I wish I could bring you his thought process and all the 25 hands as everyone of them has great teaching material. However, minding my limitation, I have hand ##25 which I like the best.

^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|This is a terrific hand. I've got eight tricks in my hand, and the King of clubs doesn't hurt, particularly behind the opening bidder. So all I need for 3NT is for partner to have a spade stopper. Even @SJ10xx|Md|0,0,sjt32,0|at| would stop them from running the suit. If that's all partner has, then they can defeat 3NT if they lead hearts early. |
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|But if your opponents always lead and defend perfectly, neither you nor I are going to win. So, if I can find partner with a spade stopper, I'll take my chances in 3NT. How do I go about achieving that? Many players would do a 'big double' scenario, or would overcall 2@D and hope partner bids no trump. And it's possible that those actions will work out OK.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|But in fact there is a very descriptive, right-to-the-point bid available. It's fair to call this an advanced bid that not all players know about. It's also fair to call this a sexy bid, one that if you learn it, and you and your partner both remember it, and you get the occasion to use it (these hands come up occasionally), you can have your cake and eat it too, and really have a memorable hand.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|So the expert bid here, when they open one of a major, is to jump to 3 of their major, which doesn't mean 'my suit is better than yours' (to the opponents). |
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|What it does mean, when you make this bid in a minor, as we saw earlier, 1@C-3@C or 1@D-3@D should be played as weak jump overcalls -- preempts with length and strength in the opponents' minor. |
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|But in a major, where the opponent is promising at least five, then we believe that the right way to play is that this bid says 'partner, I have a long running minor, I have a nice hand, but I don't have a stopper in the opponents' major. If you have a stopper, please bid 3NT; if not, then retreat to 4@C with a normal hand, and I'll announce which minor I have by passing or bidding 4@D.'|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Of course, if you have a terrific hand ' let's say you had a singleton spade and some useful high cards in the other suits, you could control bid or cue bid 4@S to say: 'Hey Marty, I can't bid 3NT like you were hoping, but I don't want to stop in a part score since you're strong and I have a good hand with a key singleton, so let's play in game in your minor, or possibly even slam.'|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Anyway, so much for fantasizing. For now, 3@S is the bid if your partner will understand you.|MB|3S|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Otherwise, you'll have to choose between 2@D and a double. If I were playing with someone where I couldn't bid 3@S, I would settle for a 2@D overcall, hoping I got another chance, and praying that partner would bid no trump with a spade stopper if she had one.|
