With his permission we produced this movie using a sample or two from his March 2017 lesson--Secrets Of Accurate Hand Evaluation.

at|^b@2|ht|w|cp||at|^bAn expert friend told me a long time ago "It's uncanny how well hands work out when they contain no jacks." He was not saying he prefers holding a deuce to holding a jack. He was just saying that when you pick up a jack and add one point, that often does not accurately reflect the value of the hand. With too many hands, a jack turns out to be a worthless honor. But, obviously, a jack could also be a critical card. If you have a queen and a ten in a 4-card suit, you would be much happier if partner holds the jack rather than not. Every card has its day in the sun.|

cp||at|After forming a first impression, my next step is to count formal HCP just like a beginner would. Then comes the most important step. I adjust the formal point count to what I think is the hand's true value. I will demonstrate how I do that shortly.|
at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bUsing 4-3-2-1 values to represent kings, queens, and jacks is not completely accurate. You need not memorize the following but it is worth mentioning:|
at|^^|cp||at|^b* The true value of an ace is 4 1/2 points.|
at|^^|cp||at|^b* A king is correct with its assigned value of 3 points.|
at|^^|cp||at|^b* A queen is only worth 1 1/2 points.|
at|^^|cp||at|^b* A jack is worth 3/4 of a point.|
at|^^|cp||at|^b* A ten, like an ace, is an underrated honor. It is worth 1/4 of a point.|
at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bWithout forcing students to use fractions and make counting high card points a complicated process, my practical method to rectify the imperfections of using the traditional values is to suggest the following:|
at|^^|cp||at|^b* If your hand contains at least 3 aces or 3 tens, add one HCP.|
at|^^|cp||at|^b* If your hand contains at least 3 queens or 3 jacks, subtract 1 HCP.|

at|^^|cp||at|^bI hope you know that Hand 20 is the best of the group. Having a long suit is better than having no long suit, and the longer the better. Longer suits help you take more tricks. That's what bridge is all about. How much better are hands with long suits? Traditional thinking says add one point for each 5-card suit (in case you are lucky enough to have more than one). Add two points for a 6-card suit, 3 points for a 7-card suit, and so forth. That is sensible as soon as you pick up your hand.|
