Every 2 months Marty Bergen creates an animated voice lesson which you can play on your computer'PC, Apple, or any device having a browser. I have his permission to produce a movie using one hand from each of his lessons. I think you will find what Marty has to say very interesting and useful. From this lesson,  I have selected hand 1.

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NMr. Bergen's audio visual lesson covering "Trump Your Most Important Suit" has an excellent introduction which we will bring a summary of. |
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Trump - your most important suit. Every time you play in a suit contract, although your trump may not be your strongest suit and it may not be your longest suit, without question it is your most important suit. How you handle trump will often make or break you. There are so many ways that trump can be the key to your success. |
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|

Sometimes you have a hand where all you need to do is draw trump and then enjoy your winners in the other suits. Please keep in mind those hands are rare. ^*BThe vast majority of the time, I would say as high as 60%, you should not be drawing trump first. Your trump can be so helpful in so many ways. You can be ruffing losers. You can be setting up a suit. You can be using your trump as entries to get where you want when you want.^*N|

^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|South opens 2@S. North has an excellent hand that is strong enough for game but not strong enough for slam after South's preempt. So North goes directly to 4@S.|

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|The opening lead is the @CQ. Declarer sees that he has 1 club loser,|HC|C2|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


AT| 1 diamond loser,|HC|D8|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


AT| and 2 potential heart losers.|HC|H42|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


NT||lb|*yShould Declarer finesse the hearts?^^N|LC|h42d8c2|cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|There is some hope of finessing in hearts, but that would be a lot more attractive if either North or South held the @H9. As it is, if declarer leads the @H10 from his hand, West should cover with the @HK and now declarer can never win the @HJ. |
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT||lb|*mWhich suit do you try to develop first?^Clubs~Diamonds~Spades~Hearts^2|cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|The better plan is to work on diamonds based on the wonders of a 5-card suit. You might think "gee those diamonds are awfully weak". I obviously agree. |
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^b@2
^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|But the fact that there are 5 diamonds means that there is hope to set up the suit. And it is nice to have all those entries available in the North hand. |
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^b@2
^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|You will make use of South's trump to remove all of the East/West diamonds. Eventually Eventually North's 5th diamond will be a winner.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT||lb|*mWhich hand do you win the lead?^North~South^2|cp|8|AT|^b@2
^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|You win the club lead in the South hand, saving North's @CA for later as an entry. When the opponents lead a suit and you can win it in either hand, the important consideration is "Where will I need to be later?" as opposed to "^*BWhere must I be right now?^*N". |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^b@2
^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|The latter is rarely crucial. After winning the @CK, you immediately lead a diamond. Don't even think about drawing trump first. That would be destroying valuable entries to North.|

PG| ***** 20 ***** |


pc|d8d9|NT||lb|*mShould declarer play?^Low Diamond~ High Diamond^1|cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|When West plays a low diamond, don't bother putting up the @DQ. There is no chance that West has both the @DA and @DK. He did not lead diamonds and he would not duck if he had that holding. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|It is possible that East started with @DAK doubleton or @DAK third. In both of those cases, you will be very happy to save dummy's @DQ which will become a winner based on strength. |
