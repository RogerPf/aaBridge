at|^i@2|ht|k|cp||at|^iEvery 2 months Marty Bergen creates an animated voice lesson which you can play on any device having a browser. I have his permission to produce a movie using one hand from each of his lessons. I think you will find what Marty has to say very interesting and useful. From his lesson titled "The Joy Of End Plays" I have selected hand number I. It illustrates how to set up a standard end play as well as several other bidding and declarer play points of interest.|
at|^c@2|ht|r|cp||at|^cThe lesson has a smart "Introduction" on the how to set an End Play followed by 15 examples. Each example contains bridge pearls by Marty Bergen in addition to the specific topic of End Plays. For further information about Mr. Bergen's voice lessons, click the link below. |

cp||at|Many players think that end plays are for experts only. This is not true. In this lesson I will show you how easy it is on many deals to set up and execute an end play. If you go through the lesson carefully and practice with the example hands, you will become proficient in end plays and make many contracts that would otherwise go down. In the deals that follow, you will see that end plays in no trump contracts do exist. However, since there is no such thing as a ruff/sluff in no trump, end plays occur far more often in suit contracts. The following steps regarding end plays in suit contracts are worth noting and keeping in mind.|

Here are some examples of suits that are not iffy. Ace-small opposite 2-small is not iffy. Neither is queen-third opposite jack-ten-third. The presence of the ten ensures that you will take one trick. Even if your queen and jack are captured, your ten will take a trick. Without the ten it is very different. |

cp||at|The correct response with the North hand is 3@s. This shows a weak hand with 4 spades. If West had passed, then the only Norths who would have bid 3@s are those that play Bergen Raises. But after the double, it is highly recommended for all players at all levels that the jump raise be weak. |

cp||at|With a limit raise you could redouble first and then raise. If you play Bergen Raises over a takeout double, you could make a Bergen (or Reverse Bergen) raise. Or you can play Jordan 2NT, which is only used after a takeout double. It is an excellent convention that is not appreciated by enough players. It should be standard for all.|

cp||at|The opening lead is the @cK.|
cp||at| I see that dummy is suitable. But I do wish the @d10 could be relocated as the @h10. We are faced with an iffy heart suit. It could be fatal that we are missing the @h10 if we lead hearts. |

cp||at|What I would like to do is strip the diamonds. Then, after drawing trump, I will throw them in with my inevitable club loser. Whichever opponent wins the club trick will be end played. He will be forced to lead hearts or give me a ruff/sluff. |
