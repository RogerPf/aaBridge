^-|fp||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Welcome to my lesson on ^*IHow to Make Effective Raises in Competition^*N. Competitive bidding is often misunderstood by many less experienced players. Competitive bidding occurs on half the hands you play or even more.  |
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

Many players use high card points as their primary means of deciding how and when to compete but this is incorrect. High Card Points are only a (very) small part of the picture. Distribution and fit with partner are much more important. In this lesson, I am going to focus on one part of competing, that is, what to do in the happy case when you have found a fit with partner.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|

The lesson is divided into several parts. First, I will discuss general guidelines for competing. Then I will discuss how to compete after an  overcall (suit bid by the opponent). I will differentiate between what to do when you have a major suit fit vs a minor suit fit. Then I will discuss what to do after your Right Hand Opponent (RHO) makes a takeout double. Again, differentiating between whether partner opened a major or a minor.|

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%Guidelines and the LAW
qx|B2, Guidelines and the Law|ht|b|cs|6|AT|^-{    General Competitive Guidelines and the Law of Total Tricks    }
^-|AT|^B@2
The single most important guideline is the ^*ILaw of Total Tricks^*N also known as LOTT. I focus first on LOTT (Bergen version) which says the following:|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


AT|
^-
{    IT IS SAFE  TO  COMPETE TO THE SAME  LEVEL AS THE ## OF TRUMPS YOUR SIDE HAS.    }
^-|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


at|

So if you have an 8-card fit, you can compete to the 2-level (8 trick contract). With a 9-card  fit, feel free to compete to the 3-level. And with a 10-card fit, compete to the 4-level.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT|

The LAW is a really good guideline. It is  much better even than most expert judgement despite what you may have heard. There are occasional hands where it is off by a trick but they are few and far between. If you use the law, you will do well. I do and I think I bid very effectively in competition.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


AT|

By the way, the LAW as I stated it is actually not the pure "Law of Total Tricks", but it is very practical and works well.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


AT|

Next I would like to tell you what the pure "Law of Total Tricks" says.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


AT| The pure "Law of Total Tricks" says the following:

^-{
    FOR EACH SIDE, TAKE THE NUMBER OF CARDS THEY HAVE IN THEIR LONGEST SUIT.    
     ADD THOSE 2 NUMBERS TOGETHER. 
     THAT NUMBER WILL GIVE YOU THE TOTAL NUMBER OF TRICKS      
IN THE DEAL IF EACH SIDE PLAYED IN THEIR LONGEST SUIT.
}^-|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


AT|

For example, if you have a 9-card fit and they have an 8-card fit, the total tricks is 17 (9+8). Then if you can make 4 (10 tricks) the other side can only make 1 (17-10 = 7). |
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


AT|

In  real life that is too complicated. If interested, however, Larry Cohen wrote an excellent book on the Law which has many charts and tables.|

pg| ***** 15 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|The pure version is much more complicated than the Bergen approach. It is almost impossible for you to know how many trumps the Opponents have. Therefore, the pure Law of Total Tricks, although theoretically interesting, is not particularly practical.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


AT|

The Bergen approach, however, is very practical. If you just focus on  how many trump you have, you will know how high to bid. That is simple, easy to apply, and most importantly, extremely effective.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


AT|

Its most important application is in the 2-level and 3-level cases. I have some very simple, but very good guidelines about that. I am sure you may have heard the saying "The 3 level belongs to the opponents." and there is some truth to that, so long as you understand how to compete.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


AT|

Let us first talk about bidding "3 over 3." That means, if the opponents have found a fit, and they are at the 3 level, and your fit is in a higher ranking suit should you bid 3 or not?|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


AT|

The answer is you should bid "3 over 3" only in the following circumstances:|

ht|r|cp|1|AT|
a) you know you have a 9-card fit or |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


ht|r|AT|
a) you know you have a 9-card fit or 
b) you have a singleton or void in their suit.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


cp||AT|

Those are the only times it is right to bid 3 over 3 for the most part. In IMPs that is always true. In Match Points, that is generally true, but it is in fact a bit more tricky. In IMPs, if you follow that rule, even if you can make 3, the opponents will likely be going down so you will get a plus score if you deserve one. However, in Match Points, if you can make 3, sometimes the opponents will go down less than your score for making 3.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


AT|

Having said that, I still think my guidelines are good even in Match Points. You will still be right more often than you are wrong. Often when you bid "3 over 3" neither side can make 3. Therefore, you turned a plus into a minus.|

HT|B|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|The decision of "3 over 2" is actually pretty easy. If you know the opponents have an 8-card fit, you should not let them play there, pretty much never at the 2 level. If you do, at best you can hope for an average result and often you will get a below average result.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


AT|

If you know the opponents have an 8 card fit and have stopped at 2, you must bid 3 over 2. If you do not know they have an 8 card fit, then you don't have to bid. For example, in the typical 2 over 1 auction of|

PG| ***** 27 ***** |


AT|

The opponents only have a 7-card fit, because responder did not raise, opener did not rebid spades. In that case, it is okay to let them play at the 2-level unless you have a long suit of your own. Let's try a few examples.|

By letting them play at the 2-level you will at best get an average and often get below average. Here you will do better overall if you bid 3H. Some of you may have your doubts and that is fine. But I would love to play against you :).|

With 4-card support you always cue bid.|

With 3-card support it is a matter of style. I think more people than not play they can cue bid if they have 10+ points and 3-card support as well as 4-card support. I am  not one of  those people (surprise, lol).|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


AT|

I think knowing you have a 9-card fit is very important. With the same high cards, a hand with a 9-card fit will usually play a trick better than an 8-card fit. The 9th trump is crucial, because you have more trump available after drawing trump. So, I do not like to cue bid with 3-card support, and will usually bid a new suit first and raise later. |
PG| ***** 77 ***** |

I play a cue bid promises 4-card support. Occasionally I get stuck and have to lie. But I really like it promising 4-card support. However, If you want to play cue bid shows 3-card support as well, that is fine.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|A negative  double is not recommended. I think a VERY important  bidding principle is, you must show support with support immediately with 4+ card support. If you do not raise partner immediately, you cannot have 4-card support. I don't care if you are 7-4, raise partner, don't bid your 7-card suit. That might be a slight exaggeration, but I am trying to make an important point here.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Bergen Raises in Competition on certain auctions are something relatively new that I have been trying and I'd like to discuss them with you. As you already know Bergen Raises are off after interference. But, you can play Bergen Raises only over 1S and 2C overcall by your Right Hand Opponent. However, in competition Bergen Raises do not work if the overcall is 2D or higher. Let me show you a few auctions. BTW, I play Reverse Bergen Raises.|

^-|CS||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Following an overcall of a minor suit opening by partner there are several important points you should always consider before making any responses.|
PG| ***** 216 ***** |


AT|

1. The game chances are not as likely when your partner opens a minor suit. And it is more likely the opponents can out bid you at the same level in the majors. So your objective is to get in their way promptly.|
PG| ***** 217 ***** |


AT|

2. Inverted Raises are off.|
PG| ***** 218 ***** |


AT|

3. A cue bid is available to show a limit raise. Therefore, there is no reason to play a raise to 2 is strong.|
PG| ***** 219 ***** |


AT|

4. When opening one of a minor, 85% or more of the time partner will have 4+ cards although it is possible that partner only has a 3-card suit. So bid as if he/she does have four.|
PG| ***** 220 ***** |


AT|

5. Your first priority as in constructive bidding still is to show a major. |
PG| ***** 221 ***** |


AT|

Absent a major your hand either is worth 6-9 or 10+ points.|
PG| ***** 222 ***** |


AT|

With less than six points you pass.|
PG| ***** 223 ***** |


AT|

Bid 1NT with a stopper in the overcallers suit and 8-11 points.|
PG| ***** 224 ***** |


AT|

Raise to 2 with 4 card support and 6-9 points - no 4+ card majors.|
PG| ***** 225 ***** |

Jump raise to 3 with 5 card support, 6-9 points, and no 4+ card majors - note additional trump card needed.|

^b@2Here the choice is not as clear. Most people would double and that might work out when partner has a strong hand and hearts. But remember you only have an 8-card fit at best in hearts (partner would open 1H with 5) and they probably have a spade fit. So tactically I like 3C better. |
PG| ***** 257 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It makes it harder for them to bid in spades and you are likely to have a 9-card fit. At least partner will probably be better positioned to compete when you bid 3C. Therefore, despite my 4 hearts, I recommend 3C (but if you want to double, that could work out on some hands).|

^b@2Both 2S and 1N are possible. 2S identifies your strong clubs. It also is more preemptive, always good in competition. On the other hand 1N shows your points, spade stopper, and is more precise. I would lean towards 1N, unless playing against a real strong pair, where I want to get in their way with 2S. Either is fine.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's go on to bidding over a takeout double. I will discuss the double over one of a major opening first. One important point I like to emphasize first is that a new bid by responder shows less than 10 points. For example 1H-x-2C is less than 10 points - keep that in mind. |
PG| ***** 294 ***** |


AT|

Some people play something slightly more complicated, which I do not particularly care for. All level bids over the double are forcing and can be made with 10+ points, but 2 level bids are not. I find that very counter-intuitive and confusing. Using that system 1D-x-1S can be and often is stronger than  1D-x-2C.|
PG| ***** 295 ***** |


AT| 

The second important note is the 1H/1S-double-1N. In this auction 1NT promises 8-11.|

The third important note is that Bergen Raises are off after competition (unless you agree otherwise). I will discuss this topic later.|

In category B - with 10+ points you redouble with 3-card support.|
PG| ***** 305 ***** |

You should bid 2NT (Jordan 2NT) with 4-card support and limit raise or better.|
PG| ***** 306 ***** |

Some experts recommend bidding redouble with 10 points holding less than 3-card support and bid 2NT with 3+ card support and limit raise or better. |

Inverted Raises are off.|
PG| ***** 349 ***** |


AT|

If you have a nice major bid it. But remember the doubler tends to promise the major, so don't bid a weak suit. You only need 4 cards, but you should have at least a couple of honors. And of course the redouble rule applies, so if you bid 1 of a major you have less than 10 points.|
PG| ***** 350 ***** |


AT|

Here again redouble is the only way to show 10 points. You bid 1N with 8-11 points and you should bid 2N with five card support and 10+ points. Weak jump shifts and weak raises are highly recommended. We can get a better understanding of the bidding with the following examples.|

^-The boards in this section come mostly from Howard's mentoring sessions
and Susan Doty's lessons in 2007 and 2008. 

As reinforcement (for my old brain cell) I have manipulated some boards to illustrate similarities
and differences in constructive bidding and competitive bidding.

Further, as you already know experts have different styles. Howard's lesson is a good example.
As a student we are free to set our own style
as long as it has been fully discussed with the partner. 

With such differences in mind I have repeated some quizzes
so that you can bid it based on the style which is announced
in the vulnerability box - top left.

Last but not the least, please look out for a few trick questions
and unrelated items!

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from the hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to that you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-
