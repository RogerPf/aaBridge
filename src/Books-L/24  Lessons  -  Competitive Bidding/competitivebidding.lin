qx|Menu|bg|6|ht|e|at|@0By special request on September 10, 2007, Howard Schutzman (BBO nickname "hondo717") gave a lesson on "^*ICompetitive Bidding^*N" in the chat room of BBO. You can review the raw footage of that session by looking at September 10, 2007 mentoring session from either BIL library or Howard's web site.

This presentation is a total makeover done in April 2011. As usual the focus is on bringing you the bridge information as lean and mean as possible. The other issues such as proper grammar, spelling and page beauty took the back bench seats. The usual information on Beginner Intermediate Lounge |CP|1|AT|^*GFOU,(BIL)^*N|CP||AT| and |CP|1|AT|^*GHOW,Howard^*N|CP||AT| is not in the beginning of the presentation.

cp||fp||cp|8|AT|@1^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This lesson is by special request, and is instead of my usual weekly mentoring session. I am going to discuss guidelines to competitive bidding. The material presented here is also on my web site. You may download it, as well as many other things. The address is |cp|8|at|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge^*N|cp||AT|.|

First of all, let me define what I mean by a competitive auction. A competitive auction occurs when each side has approximately the same number of points. Typically each side has somewhere between 17 and 23 HCP. This scenario happens in a majority of the deals so it is very common. It may surprise you, but the single most important criteria for bidding in competitive auctions is the total number of trumps you have between the two hands.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


at|

The simplest way to explain this is that if you can figure out the number of trumps you have, you can safely bid the number of tricks equal to the number of trumps. For example, if you have 8 trumps between the 2 hands, you can safely bid to the 2 level. Similarly, with 9 trumps, you can safely bid to the 3 level.  With 10 trumps, to the 4 level. BTW, this is why when Pard opens ONE of a major and you have 5 of his suit, you jump to 4 level.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
ht|e|at|This principle is based on what is known as the |cp|8|at|"Law of Total Tricks"|cp||at| and if you want a detailed explanation, Larry Cohen has written an excellent book about this law. Marty Bergen (yes the same guy who invented Bergen Raises) has a couple of books entitled "Points Schmoints" which are particularly suited to beginners and intermediates. However, the critical way you apply the law is how I explained it.  The more trump you have, the higher you can bid.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|

A Kib: are you saying if you KNOW you have 10 trumps you can bypass all the convention and go directly to game? |
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


AT|

Pretty much, unless you are worried about slam. Simply said, if Pard opens 1S and you have 5 spades and less than 10 points, it is almost always right to bid 4S.  So, trump length is the main criteria.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|

A Kib: So, if your partner bid 1H and you have 7 hearts you can go directly to 6H?|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|

Let's not get carried away now, LOL. Now, there is one other point regarding trump length. In a competitive hand, it is almost never right to let the opponents play at the 2 level. Basically the rule applies through the 4 level for sure, after that, theoretically it still applies, but you must be more judicious.  And since 11+ card trump fits are pretty rare, I wouldn't worry too much about it.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|

A Kib: This shows the problem with any "Law". You can't let it be a substitute for judgment.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|

Yes, you still must use judgment, but the Law is a very good guideline. When in doubt, I find it works very well on most hands. Now, let us go back to playing at the 2 level. In competitive hands, it is  almost never right to let the opponents play at the 2 level.  So, if they stop at the 2 level, even if you only have an 8 card fit, you probably should usually go to the 3 level if you have to. However, once they get to the 3 level, you usually let them play it there unless you have a 9 card fit.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


at|

A Kib: Is vulnerability important here?|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|

Vulnerability is a factor, but only on very close decisions. Do not over worry about vulnerability, especially at IMPs, where you rarely get doubled in partials.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


NT||
%%%%%%%%%
ht|e|at|Okay, a couple of other things to consider as well, but less important than the total number of trumps. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|

^b@2^Z@3A singleton or void in the opponents trump suit is very valuable. If the opponents are at the 3 level, and you think you only have an 8 card fit, but you have a singleton in their suit, it might be right to bid 3.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


at|

Also where your points are located should be considered. Points in your suit or suits are very valuable on offense, and should make you bid more. On the other hand, points in their suits are better for defense, and should tend to make you want to bid less.|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


at|

Next, let us outline the important points. |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


cp|8|at|

^C1. Trump Length  -MOST IMPORTANT;  |

Let's go to the table. At the table, I have one hand with 11 different auctions. Believe it or not just to illustrate how the value of your hand changes depending on the auction. Then, I have another hand, with 5 more auctions. Through out the entire session the hand shown is your hand and you are sitting North and (South) your partner is the dealer. Please review the hand and the bidding carefully, make your bid and the reason you made it before clicking the arrow box. After clicking the arrow box you will see  my recommended bid. |

^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My recommendation is 3S, because as most of you said, you have at least a 9 card fit. And you also have a singleton diamond, so all experts would bid 3S. Remember, trump length is paramount.|mb|3s|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


at|
A Kib: I have question. If your partner had overcalled  do you still bid 3S?|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |

Yes, but good question. Trump length rule still applies. Let us do the next auction|

@0^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I tend to like to declare if possible, so I would bid 3S. In the long run, though, I still would bid 3S.|MB|3S|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


AT|
A Kib: Would it make a difference if the heart bidder was behind you or not?|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


AT|
It would make it less likely to beat 3H. And, actually would make it more likely for I to bid 3S.  Remember, they could have a 9 card fit too, so Pard could easily have a singleton.  The only reason not to bid 3S is if the hearts are behind you and you might push them into a make-able game. On to the next auction.|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


 
==================================== 3
rh||ah|COMPETITIVE|ah|BIDDING|AH|3|ub|7|mb|1H1S2H2SPP?|lb|*bWhat would be your bid?^^3h|nt||cp|8|AT|
@0^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are 2 conflicting issues here. The first is you have the opponents suit and, you probably only have an 8 card fit. The reason I say you likely have an 8-card fit is because pard also knows about the trump length rule. With 6 hearts, he would have bid 3H.  So you have defense and an 8-card fit, making you want to pass 2S.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
@0^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| However, there is one counter argument. If you remember, I said it is usually not a good idea to let the opponents play at the 2 level. So you could make an argument that you should bid 3H.  The other thing is you might push them to bid 3S.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


mb|3H|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


At|
A Kib: I think I'd bid it, I'd rather be -50 than -110.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


at|
Another Kib: But partner must have a pretty ratty hand not to compete with a singleton.|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


at|
Both of you make good arguments. This is definitely not clear-cut.  Okay, so this one is controversial, depends on your mood. Next auction is coming up.|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |

rh||ah|COMPETITIVE|ah|BIDDING|AH|4|ub|7|mb|1H2D2H3DPP?|lb|*bThis is the fourth auction. What would be your bid?^^3H|nt||cp|8|aT|
@0^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You could make an argument either way. You could pass, because you only have an 8-card fit and they are at the 3 level already. So you could pass. However, as I said before, shortness in their suit is a big asset on defense. With the singleton and such good hearts, I would tend to bid 3H. But, as I said, pass is reasonable as well.|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


mb|3H|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


at|
A Kib: But you have 8 losing tricks.|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


at|
But you should definitely really like shortness in their suit--worth 4 or 5 points. It's basically a glass half full or half empty argument. Either is right. I favor 3H.|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


======================================== 5
rh||ah|COMPETITIVE|ah|BIDDING|AH|5|UB|7|mb|P1DP2DPP?|lb|*bFor the fifth auction what would be your bid?^^x|NT||cp|8|AT|
@0^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at|This is known as a balancing double. Even though you only have 6 points. Pard must have something, unless the opponents are extremely conservative.  A "balancing double" is when you bid in the pass out seat.  You are allowed to balance with as few as 6 or 7 points on some hands. The idea being the opponents have limited their hands, so you are playing partner for some cards. Partner may even have 13 or 14 but was unable to bid because did not have a suitable suit or takeout double.
|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


mb|x|nt|
A Kib: What if Opponents playing inverted minors?  Is double still the bid?|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


at|
If opponents playing inverted minors, then they made a mistake as 2D is forcing. So, for the purposes of this lesson, assume you are playing against expert bidders. Let us move on to the next auction.|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


 
%%%================================== 6
rh||ah|COMPETITIVE|ah|BIDDING|AH|6|ub|8|mb|P1HP2HPP?|lb|*bWhat would be your bid?^^3c|NT||cp|8|aT|
@0^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| Another interesting hand. I think double is out, because I can almost guarantee you pard would bid diamonds. So, I think the only choices are pass or 3C. The bid of 3C just says you have clubs. The basic idea is if they have a fit, mathematically you have a fit too.|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


NT||mb|3c|cp|8|aT|
@0^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at|Let me explain why. Assume they have a 9 card fit. Since you and your partner have 26 cards between you, and only 4 of them are in the opponents suit, you and your pard have 22 cards outside their suit. Then, you must have at least one 8-card fit. Or at worst you have two 7-card fits and one 8-card fit. Therefore, I would bid 3C. But would be very nervous when I did so. In fact, vulnerable I probably would not do it.  Your 2 choices are pass or 3C. The adventurous ones should bid 3C, conservative ones should pass. |
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3
A Kib: Is 3C much better than 2S?|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


at|
Your question is very reasonable, and some people might bid 2S.  However, I would like to have a better suit, then  3C would be my choice. Here, it is possible we even have a 9-card fit.  With 2S, we have at best an 8-card fit because pard would probably overcall with 5S.|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


==================================== 7
rh||ah|COMPETITIVE|ah|BIDDING|AH|7|UB|7|mb|PPP1D2C2D3C3DPP?|lb|*bWhat would be your bid?^^4C|NT||cp|8|aT|
@0^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, let me ask you this. If Pard had overcalled spades or hearts, and you had 5 of his suit, what would you bid? |
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


at|Probably 4 of the suit. So, this is really not different. you have a known 10 card fit, so you should be comfortable bidding to the 4 level. Remember, I said you should be comfortable bidding based on the number of trumps you have. And here your singleton diamonds is wonderful. I really think 4C stands out. |
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


mb|4c|nt|^B@2^Z@3 
A Kib: But does the 3C bid promise 5 clubs? And if North had 5 clubs wouldn't he bid 4?|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


at|
Your Pard overcalled clubs, promising 5. And you only promising 3 or 4 clubs. |
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


 
======================================== 8
rh||ah|COMPETITIVE|ah|BIDDING|AH|8|UB|11|mb|PPP1S2C2S3C3SPP?|lb|*bWhat would be your bid?^^4c|NT||cp|8|aT|
@0^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I can understand some may pass, but I would bid 4C. I am actually hoping to push them to 4S so I can double.|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


mb|4c|at|
A Kib: Again if North had 5 Clubs's he could bid 4 directly according to your plan, |
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


AT|
Yes, I could have bid 4C right away, but why jump when they might let me play at 3C?  Pass is reasonable here too, but I tend to like to play 10 card fits up to the 4 level.|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |

rh||ah|COMPETITIVE|ah|BIDDING|AH|9|ub|11|mb|PPP1H2C2H3C3HPP?|lb|*bWhat would be your bid?^^p|nt||cp|8|aT|
@0^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, those of you who voted for pass, why did you do so, since you still have a 10 card fit.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


mb|p|AT|
Kibs: Partner is a passed hand and you might push the opponents to a makable game.|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


at|
Yes, this hand is a little different. Although 4C probably works out fine if they let you play it there. I would be afraid of pushing them into making game. So, unlike the last hand, where I was willing to defend 4S, I would pass 3H, because I would not be happy if they bid 4H.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT||cp|8|aT|
@0^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I use the following rule for bidding a minor at the 4 level. You have to decide what you are going to do if they bid game over your bid. If you are not willing to double them if they bid game, then you should not bid 4 of the minor. This is more of a tactical consideration. Because if you push them into a makeable game, you will lose a lot of IMPs. The risk in this case is higher than the reward for bidding 4C.|

@0^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Almost all experts would bid 4S on this hand. So, with a known 10 card fit, you should bid 4S.  You are making it very hard for the opponents to bid. They might even have a slam.  You could get doubled and go down a lot, but that is unlikely, and if you do, then they are probably cold for a slam.|

@0^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Assume you hold the hand shown above for each of the following auctions. There are not necessarily right or wrong answers. The important thing is to develop some principles that help you judge whether or not to bid, and apply those principles consistently. If you need more explanation email your answers to me. I define a competitive auction as one in which each side has at least one 8 card fit and the points are relatively even (17-23 HCP for each side). I use the following guidelines for competitive auctions: |
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


NT||aT|
^B@2^Z@31. Do not let the opponents play at the 2 level.
2. If the opponents are already at the 3 level, only compete to the 3 level if you have a nine card fit or a singleton in the opponent's suit.

CP||fp||ht|f|at|^c@2^Y@3Maureen Hall ( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :
^D* For beginner bridge players to escape to
^D* Where we could have teachers come and give lessons without interference from Advanced players
^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice
^D* For the beginner to go to and have one on one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions

In 2001/2/3  there was nowhere for that to happen and so in September 2003 Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began.

Nowadays there are lessons and tournaments  for BIL members to take part in every day of the year. All members can apply to have a mentor if they wish to do so and every endeavour is made to find one for them.  

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project – the BIL Library was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7 .  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum ( the Alfresco café) , to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.
