Soon after a player opens (Opener) the other seats receive specific designations. For example in the above auction North gets "Immediate Seat and/or the Direct Seat" designation. East is the responder and South gets the "Balancing Seat" designation which is the focus of this presentation.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


sb|s|NT|^B@2
The player in the Balancing seat has the option of either bidding the third Pass, which ends the auction, or to take some additional action in order to increase the level of play by the opponents and/or to compete for his side. Therefore, all bids, including double at that seat are considered ^*bbalancing^*N bids.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|^B@2

Further, from the bidding as is shown above, South has the following information which Howard will outline in the next panel.|

^-|ht|f|CP||CS||at|
^bFrom the above auction we can gather the following information:

^b@2a) It is known that East has 5 HCP or less

^B@2b) South knows nothing about opener's hand other than he has 5 hearts, less than a 2@C opener, and did not open 1N or 2N. That still leaves a wide range of possible hands. There is a difference than if Opener bid 1@C or 1@D. There, it is possible (although not that likely) that Opener only has a 3-card suit. And he often will have only a 4-card suit. So on this auction, you do know that Opener has some protection in that his suit is real.

^B@2c) Generally partner (direct seat) will have less than 15 or so. With 15+, partner almost always takes some action, even an imperfect one.

^B@2d) South know that your side has at least 16 or 17 HCP between them, usually much more. Opener has no more than 20, responder no more than 5. So theoretically they could have 25, But a practical absolute max for them is 23, leaving at least 17 for the other side-South's side. The main point is that, at worst, the HCP are pretty evenly divided and more often than not South's side has the majority of HCP.|

Therefore,  balancing is built on the principle that letting the opponents play hands at 2@S or lower is not good bridge. As the saying goes, "Try to Bid 'Em Up" particularly with favorable vulnerability. Let us borrow a board from Howard's recent mentoring session and get more insight.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Obviously the 2N ^*Bis not Unusual 2N^*N. If I were 5/5 in the minors, I would have bid 2N over 1@S. If I had a strong NT, I would have bid 1N over 1S. So my 2N can be neither of those. My 2N bid is takeout for the minors. In a pinch, I could even be 4/4 in the minors although 5/4 is more common. I do not want to let them play in 2@S, as you know. |
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I cannot make a balancing double, because I do not have long enough hearts. One choice would be to bid 3@C, which would be reasonable. However, because I also have diamonds I can bid 2N, which asks partner to choose his better minor.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |

stanira3: is that an OBAR bid?|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|OBAR stands for "Opponents Bid And Raise". It is Bergen's method of getting into the auction when it goes 1x-p-2x-?. His theory is that whichever person is short in the opponents suit should get into the auction. |
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, if it is your turn to bid after 2x, and you are short in suit x, you should bid if you possibly can. You can overcall a good suit or you can make a takeout double. A third alternative that Bergen recommends is to bid 2N, which is takeout for the 2 lower unbid suits (usually the minors), similar in concept to what I discussed above. |
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Absent an agreement that you are playing 2N as a Bergen OBAR 2N, that would be unusual, showing 5/5. But Bergen feels (and I agree) that you should get into the auction even with less distribution, so 2N should show 5/4 or possibly even 4/4.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Bergen also calls OBAR bids "pre-balancing" because the person who bids directly over 2x is not showing strength, just shortness in suit x and a willingness to compete. Partner of the bidder should not get too excited because, just as with normal balancing, the OBAR bidder is bidding on the combined partnership assets and is assuming even if his hand is not that strong, his partner's must be.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, as you will see shortly, since they make 3@S it did not matter that I balanced. But on some hands, they can make 2 but not 3. You rarely get a good score when the opponents stop in 2 with an 8-card fit, so you should strain to balance. "If they have a fit" you have a fit.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Let us look at the math. If they have an 8 card fit, you only have 5 cards in their suit between your hand and partners. So you have 21 cards in the other 3 suits. It is barely possible that you have 3 7-card fits (3 x 7 = 21). However, odds strongly favor an 8 or even 9 card fit as on this hand. And my competitive bidding rules say it is ok to bid 3 over 2 with an 8 card fit, even though it does not meet the LOTT.|

By the progress of the bidding it is clear that:
^cThe points are evenly divided.
^cOpponents have a fit and you have a fit.
^cIt is bad bridge to let them play the hand in 2H unless you (South) are broke.|

Balancing bids come in many flavors and requires use of logic and thinking based on the concept of, "Do not let the opponents play many hands at 2 Spades or lower unmolested.", particularly with favorable vulnerability.|sb|S|

The more cards you have in the opponents' suit, the less chance there is that you and partner will have a fit. It's often best to pass and let opener play in what may be a bad contract.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NNext is an in depth analysis of such situation by Howard.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT|^B@2
There is some merit to passing with that hand, because partner is probably short in hearts (since there are at most 4 hearts between North and East) and chose not to double or overcall. However, I have found you rarely get a good result by letting the opponents play at the 1 level. |
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I would bid 1NT with that hand, despite the singleton spade. If the opponents were at the 2 level, I would let them play rather than bid. The main danger in bidding is that the opponents will find their likely spade fit and you will get a worse result.|

NT||
cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|While it is true you should be more conservative, in general, other than some very rare borderline hands, vulnerability has very little effect on when you balance. Most people do not balance when they should, and this just gives them another excuse to make a bad decision not to balance. Bottom line is, vulnerability is a minor factor at best in deciding whether or not to balance.|

%%A12
st||pn|Balancing Seat, Opener,Direct Seat,Responder|md|2,,,|sv|n|RH||AH|A12 - Balancing|AH|How strong is partner's hand|mb|1hpp?|NT|^B@2
Another reason for making a balancing bid is to protect partner when he has good values, but did not have a descriptive bid available in the direct seat. Therefore, it is important to know how strong is partner's hand.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Conventional wisdom has it that when the opponents pass out a one level bid, you can probably assume that on average, your side will have about one half of the points. Your side will have 20-22 points and the opponents will have 18-20 points. (14-16 for opener, 4 for his partner). Subtract your High Card Points from your side's 20-22 to determine partner's points-but hardly ever above 17 points. Those are probably just educated guesses.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Further, there are times that partner's pass is a "trap pass"-has a strong hand and length in opener's suit. At 1 level you possibly can figure out how many trumps partner has. In this example, assuming opener has five hearts and the responder has 2, your side could have about 6 hearts. Subtract the number of cards you have from 6 to determine partner's length in that suit-partner could have about 5 hearts.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In the example as is shown above|MD|0sk974h3caj74dqt93,0,0,0|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


at| partner is likely to have 5 hearts. Therefore, he probably converts the double by South to a penalty double. However, those assumptions as mentioned are conventional wisdom. For a more realistic calculation let us listen to Howard next. |
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|While it is true, with a singleton heart, that partner is more likely to have hearts, it is not true on average your side will have 6 hearts. You have no idea how many hearts either side has. Opener could easily have 6  hearts and occasionally will have 7 or (rarely) 8.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|And let's say opener has 5 hearts. That leaves 8 between the other 3 hands. You have 1, leaving 7 for North and East. On average, partner will have 3.5 hearts (half of the 7 remaining hearts) meaning the opponents have an average of 8.5 hearts even if opener has 5 hearts (and opener could easily have more). I grant you that when responder has 4 hearts he will jump to 3@H if playing Bergen raises. If responder has 5 hearts he will jump to 4@H. So that means it is slightly less likely that responder has 4 or 5 hearts and slightly more likely he has 3 or fewer hearts.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|If opener has 6 hearts and you have a singleton, on average their side will have a 9-card fit. So once opener opens 1@H, it is quite likely that their side has 8 or more hearts when you have a singleton.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Nevertheless, you should still stretch to balance with shortness in opener's suit, for the same reason you always stretch to compete when short in their suit-your hand is worth more on offense when you are short. But it is very unlikely partner has 5 hearts.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Even with the likelihood that partner has a lot of hearts, defending 1@H doubled will rarely net you a good result. Because, if you beat it 2, which is pretty hard, you often can make 3N, which will get you more points. It is likely at best you will get an average result, and often below average.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|In summary, if you're short in opener's suit, stretch to balance. It's more likely partner has the stronger hand-his length in their suit may well be the reason he couldn't bid.|mb|x|

Bidding in balancing seat is literally a balancing act and battling for part score contract. If you bid more than you should and get doubled while vulnerable you lose way more points than opponents could collect making a part score. You have room for safety when not vulnerable and the opponents are. Be conservative when you are vulnerable and they are not-as is now.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Further, Howard strongly stressed the following:|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


AT|

"You will rarely get doubled in a part score, particularly once it goes 1x-p-p. In fact, the fewer points you have, the better positioned your side is to do well. Since your side usually has at least half the deck, if you have fewer points, that means your partner has more points. And your partner's points are well positioned behind the opponent with most of the points."|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT|^B@2
"Your finesses are all going to work. Although it is counter intuitive, it is actually worse if the balancer has a pretty good hand with the majority of the partnership assets, because, by the same reasoning. most of the opponents strength is behind your side's strength, meaning your finesses all rate to lose."|

PG| ***** 82 ***** |


HT|q|fp|2|at|^b@2Balancing Over an Opening Notrump (1NT - Pass - Pass - ?):|FP||AT| Is either natural or conventional and will not be reviewed here. There are many very good learning resources available.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


ht|s|fp|2|at|Balancing after a Suit Opening Bid (1@C/1@D/1@H/1@S - Pass - Pass - ?):|FP||AT| Minimum requirements for suit bid at 1 level (1@D-Pass-Pass-1@H) = 8-13 points, usually a 5+-card suit (but may be a good 4-card suit at the one-level). The better your suit, the fewer points you need to bid. The lower number is about 3 points less than 11 points required for a direct overcall-thus the term borrowing a King from partner. A jump in the balancing seat in a new suit (1@H-Pass-Pass-2@S = 13-16 points) invites game.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


ht|x|at|^b@2Many experts, including Howard, do not agree with 8-13 mentioned above. As was said in example A8 many experts will balance with a quality suit and fewer points particularly at the 2 level or could have more points than 13. Further, Howard says, "The 'borrowing a king' expression is incorrect. When you are balancing, you are bidding based on the partnership resources, not what you have in your own hand."|

^-|CP||CS||ht|d|fp|2|AT|^B@2To bid 1NT (1@D-Pass-Pass-1NT):|fp||AT| You need about 11-14 points with stoppers (or moderate length) in the opponent's suit. Some experts raise the range to 13-15 (or a poor 16) points if notrumper is vulnerable and/or if the opening bid was 1@H or 1@S.|

HT|g|fp|2|AT|Jump to 2NT (1@S-Pass-Pass-2NT):|fp||AT| = This can also be assigned one of two meanings: 
   1 - 21-22 points, balanced-Bergen and Howard play this option; or 
   2 - Unusual, showing length in the two lower unbid suits (this meaning is probably more valuable).|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


ht|j|fp|2|AT|^B@2Bid of the opponent's suit (1@H-Pass-Pass-2@H)|fp||AT|: 2@H in this sequence is called a cuebid, and depending on your partnership's agreement, it can be one of followings: 
   1 - A two-suited hand (the Michaels convention); or 
   2 - A strong, game-forcing takeout.|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


ht|n|fp|2|AT|Double|fp||AT|: The double in balancing seat is very similar to takeout double in direct seat except the points needed are less. You can make a balancing double with as little as 7 or 8 points, especially if you are short in opener's suit.

Further, you:|fp|2|AT|
^c@2Double |fp||AT|and bid 1N on the second round to show a 15-18 points hand. 1NT bid originally shows only 11/12-14/15 points.|fp|2|AT|
^C@2Double |fp||AT|and correct to a suit is just about the same as a double and correct in direct seat (16+). You can shave it a point with a real nice suit.|

The opponents have a fit in a major suit, but they stopped in 2@H. Not only is the 2H bidder weak, but when opener re-evaluated his hand after finding a fit, he didn't even have enough strength for a game-try. He must have a minimum opening bid, so their side has only 18-22 HCP. You have just 4 HCP, so partner must have a very strong hand.|

Smart money would be on pass. One of the bids in balancing process is a pass. Sure South can overcall 1@H.

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NHoward has a more complete answer, "A balancing double tends to show 4 cards in the other major, but you  can do it with a 3-card suit much more often than when you make a direct seat takeout double. So I would say it promises 3.5."|

East is very weak. Therefore, after an expected pass by West.|mb|p|

Values like this scream for offense, not defense. A takeout double could be a mistake for a number of reasons.|
PG| ***** 188 ***** |


NT|^B@2
First and foremost, if partner opted to pass, converting your takeout to penalty with club length, this might not work out very well. |
PG| ***** 189 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In addition, why ask your partner’s opinion via double, when in reality, you don’t much care what she thinks. A jump to 2H in this position shows a hand of intermediate strength with a long, strong suit.|
PG| ***** 190 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Hmm, an action that clearly resembles the cards above. After this descriptive bid, partner is invited to take action, but should not be terribly concerned about the length or strength of support for your suit. |

The hand you actually held (the original hand is reloaded) could best be played in any of the three available suits or notrump, and should partner pass for penalty (not likely, but possible, the way some people open two card club suits), you would be delighted.|
PG| ***** 192 ***** |

My preferred action with your hand would be a jump to 2NT.|MB|2N|
PG| ***** 193 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Although typically played as some type of weak, two-suited hand when bid in the direct seat, 2NT in the passout seat is best defined as a natural bid, showing 19 to 21 high-card points with a stopper. After this action, your partnership should play the same response structure you play to an opening bid of 2NT.|
PG| ***** 194 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Although this action is not perfect (because it conceals your five-card heart suit), I think it is the best compromise. One of my ^*BJerryisms^*N covers this very topic:|

In balancing seat you can make a takeout double with as few as 10 points and proper distribution. You have 4 cards in spades and you are 4-3 in the unbid minors. However, you must pass the same hand in direct seat. Further, you can make a balancing double with as few as 7 o 8 HCP if you are short (singleton or void) in opener's suit Clearly, in balancing seat, you do not wish to let the opponents play in 1H-not a good bridge.|

You have strength to bid something. But, with length in the opponent's suit and shortness in the unbid major, pass is the best bid. let them play in a mediocre contract-good bridge.|

In balancing seat you stretch to bid and prevent the opponents play in a cheap contract. For this 1 level overcall in balancing seat you need about 8 to 15 points.|

You could not bid this hand in direct seat. However, in balancing seat you have enough to overcall 2@D. You need about 10 to 15 points at the 2 level-the lower range is higher for a 2 level. With a stronger hand (16+) you double first then bid your suit later-next example.|

You are too strong for a 2@H overcall in balancing seat. You need to double first and introduce your heart on the second round. Partner cannot pass even if the LHO passes. In balancing seat with 16+ points you double first then bid your suit later.|

^*BMM^*N: Bidding 1N or 2N in the balancing seat can get a bit confusing. The experts hardly agree on the points needed for bidding 1NT in balancing seat. The ranges are 10 to 11 for the lower limit and 12 to 15 for the upper limit. Howard plays 11-14 range and is used in this presentation.|

South should bid 1NT which shows 11/12 to 14/15 HCP, balanced hand and spade stopper. With 16 to 18 HCP South must double first then bid notrump later.|

A jump to 2 NT shows 19 to 21 HCP. (The unusual 2 NT bid does not apply unless you have previously passed.) If South doubled and bid 2 NT, it would show 16-18, so this logically shows a better hand.|

Since South cannot bid the unusual 2NT, the sensible plan is to bid diamonds first; this is unlikely to be passed out, then South will bid 3@C next.|

^*BMM: ^*NGenerally you should balance unless you have secondary strength (Q-J-x, K-J-x-x, etc.) in the enemy suit. There are no specific point-count requirements; whatever you lack, partner should have.|

South doubles hoping that West will bid hearts. At his next turn South corrects to 3@D  since he lacks club support.|

BTW, the correct of 3@C to 3@D is not "double and correct" showing a strong hand. If South had a strong hand with diamonds, he would have doubled 1S originally.|
