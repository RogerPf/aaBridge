This short synopsis is based on "Raises in Competition" lesson by ^*BHoward Schutzman^*N, (BBO nickname hondo717"). The link to the original lesson is |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/3w6z9w^*N|CP||AT|.

As part of the Survival Kit group this is a stripped down version. It is what you need in a pinch. However, you probably would like to review Howard's lesson in its entirety. Also, it is suggested that you carefully study the Law of Total Tricks from this |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/087z9w^*N|CP||AT| ASAP.

In this synopsis, unless clearly indicated consider the information as told by Howard. To start the presentation please click forward arrow.

HT|B|FP||CS|6|at|^-{    Major Principles In Competitive Bidding    }
^-|fp||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Competitive bidding occurs on half the hands you play or even more. Many players use HCP as their primary means of deciding how and when to compete. But HCP are only a (very) small part of the picture. Distribution and fit with partner are much more important. In competitive bidding, the single most important guideline is the ^*ILaw of Total Tricks^*N also known as LOTT |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/087z9w^*N|CP||AT|. Here I focus first on LOTT (Bergen version) which says the following:|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |

^-
{    IT IS SAFE  TO  COMPETE TO THE SAME  LEVEL AS THE ## OF TRUMPS YOUR SIDE HAS.    }
^-|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |

So if you have an 8-card fit, you can compete to the 2-level (8 trick contract). With a 9-card  fit, feel free to compete to the 3-level. And with a 10-card fit, compete to the 4-level.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|

The LAW is a really good guideline. It is  much better even than most expert judgement despite what you may have heard. If you use the law, you will do well. By the way, the LAW as I stated it is actually not the pure "Law of Total Tricks", but it is very practical and works well.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|

The pure "Law of Total Tricks" says the following:

^-{
    FOR EACH SIDE, TAKE THE NUMBER OF CARDS THEY HAVE IN THEIR LONGEST SUIT.    
     ADD THOSE 2 NUMBERS TOGETHER. 
     THAT NUMBER WILL GIVE YOU THE TOTAL NUMBER OF TRICKS      
IN THE DEAL IF EACH SIDE PLAYED IN THEIR LONGEST SUIT.
}^-|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |

For example, if you have a 9-card fit and they have an 8-card fit, the total tricks is 17 (9+8). Then if you can make 4 (10 tricks) the other side can only make 1 (17-10 = 7). |

The pure version is much more complicated than the Bergen approach. The Bergen approach, however, is very practical. If you just focus on how many trump you have, you will know how high to bid. That is simple, easy to apply, and most importantly, extremely effective.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT|

Its most important application is in the 2-level and 3-level cases. I have some very simple, but very good guidelines about that. I am sure you may have heard the saying "The 3 level belongs to the opponents." and there is some truth to that, so long as you understand how to compete.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |

Let us first talk about bidding "3 over 3." That means, if the opponents have found a fit, and they are at the 3 level, and your fit is in a higher ranking suit should you bid 3 or not?|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


AT|

The answer is you should bid "3 over 3" only in the following circumstances:|

ht|k|AT|
a) you know you have a 9-card fit or 
b) you have a singleton or void in their suit.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


cp||AT|

Those are the only times it is right to bid 3 over 3 for the most part. In IMPs that is always true. In Match Points, that is generally true, but it is in fact a bit more tricky. |
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


AT|

The decision of "3 over 2" is actually pretty easy. If you know the opponents have an 8-card fit, you should not let them play there, pretty much never at the 2 level. If you do, at best you can hope for an average result and often you will get a below average result.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


AT|

If you know the opponents have an 8 card fit and have stopped at 2, you must bid 3 over 2. If you do not know they have an 8 card fit, then you don't have to bid. For example, in the typical 2 over 1 auction of|

PG| ***** 16 ***** |


ht|v|AT|^m@2The opponents only have a 7-card fit, because responder did not raise, opener did not rebid spades. In that case, it is okay to let them play at the 2-level unless you have a long suit of your own. Let's try a few examples.|

HT|e|at|^e{|ia|,1S2D3s|at|}|ht|l|at|^B@2The correct bid is 3@S. With a 9-card fit, you should bid 3@S over 2@D. So do it right away. Don't let the opponents communicate. Please note even if you play 3@S is a limit raise, in modern bridge, 3@S competition is not a limit raise. With a limit raise hand you would cue bid the opponent's suit (3@D) to show a limit raise value.|

By letting them play at the 2-level you will at best get an average and often get below average. Here you will do better overall if you bid 3@H. Some of you may have your doubts and that is fine. But I would love to play against you :). And yes I bid 3@H irrespective of the vulnerability.|
