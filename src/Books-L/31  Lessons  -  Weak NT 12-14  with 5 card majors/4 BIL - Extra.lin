^-|ht|d|fp||cp|8|AT| ^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|In this section, I will discuss a method I invented for competing when the opponents double the 1NT bid. The method applies whether the double is made directly (by responder's right hand opponent) or in balancing seat (by responder's left hand opponent after 2 passes).. |
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

It is based on the ^*BDONT^*N convention played by many pairs when competing over 1NT opening bids. I have therefore named this approach "^*BDONT Runouts"^*N. It lets you to find the best place to play when the opponents have doubled your partner's weak 1NT opening bid. The method is very flexible and allows for the following:|

ht|o|at|You can play in 1N doubled if responder has a sufficiently strong hand. |
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


HT|q|AT|Let us see how the system works. Partner opens 1N and RHO doubles, or partner opens 1N, LHO doubles after 2 passes, and RHO passes. As responder you have the following choices:|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


AT|

You pass if you want to play 1N doubled (typically a balanced hand with at least 8 HCP).|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT|

With a single suited hand (5 card suit or longer), you redouble. Partner is forced to bid 2@C, and you bid your suit (or pass if your suit is clubs). With spades, you have the option of bidding 2S directly, which jams the opponents.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


AT|

With two suits (and you may have as little as 4-4), you bid the lower ranking suit. Partner passes with 3 card support, and bids the next higher suit with a doubleton. Since partner cannot open 1N with 2 doubletons, you are guaranteed to play in a 4-3 fit at worst. For example, with diamonds and spades, you would bid 2 diamonds. If partner has a doubleton diamond, he bids 2@H.You then correct to 2 spades. |

^-|ht|d|fp||cp|8|AT| ^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|I recommend you play this system even if RHO's double is not penalty (for example, showing a single suited hand). It is simpler and more consistent, and allows you to compete effectively. |
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


AT|

If you prefer the "new" DONT, you can modify this system appropriately. In the new DONT, 2@H and 2@S are single suited hands. Therefore, redouble shows either a single suited minor, or hearts and spades (if responder corrects 2@C to 2@H, it shows hearts and spades).The advantage of the new DONT is that with a single suited major, you can compete more effectively. |

^-|ht|d|fp||cp|8|AT| ^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|With the strong NT, I recommend when the opponents overcall that you play systems on and "stolen bid doubles". This means that all bids by responder retain the same meaning as if there had been no overcall, and a double means "the opponent made the bid I wanted to make (he 'stole' my bid)". This is a very simple and effective approach.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


AT|

However, with the weak NT, it is more likely the points are evenly divided between the two sides, and you need more flexibility in competing for part scores. Therefore, I recommend you play the Lebensohl convention if you play weak 1N openers. It is somewhat more complicated than systems on, but it is a lot more flexible.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


AT|

Before I get into the specifics, let me explain the general guidelines behind Lebensohl:

Bids at the 2 level are natural and to play. 

Bids at the 3 level are natural and forcing to game.

A bid of 2N is completely artificial and forces opener to bid 3@C. It is used for several purposes. The most common is to play a partial at the 3 level when the opponent has bid a suit higher than the suit in which responder wants to compete. Another less common usage is to indicate responder has a stopper in the suit bid by the opponents. If responder forces to game after bidding 2N (as described below), he is showing a stopper. If responder forces to game without bidding 2N, he is denying a stopper. Lebensohl adherents call this "Slow Action Shows Stopper" (SASS).|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


AT|

In the next few paragraphs, I will describe how responder handles various hand types.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT|

^*BResponder wishes to play a partial in a 5+ card suit^*N
If the suit is higher than the suit bid by the opponents (for example, responder has spades and hearts were overcalled), responder can simply bid that suit at the 2 level. As indicated above, 2 level bids by responder are natural and to play.

If the suit is lower than the suit bid by the opponents (for example, responder has diamonds and hearts were overcalled), responder bids 2N, a completely artificial bid. Opener must bid 3C. Responder can pass if he wishes to compete in clubs. Otherwise, responder can bid his suit (diamonds in the example) and opener is required to pass. Note that this treatment only applies if responder's suit is lower than the overcalled suit. In the above example, if responder bid 3S over opener's forced 3C bid, that has a whole different meaning, as explained below (if responder wanted to play in a spade partial, he would simply bid 2@S).|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


AT|

^*BResponder has a 5 card suit and game forcing values^*N
Responder simply bids the suit at the 3 level. For example, assume hearts were overcalled. Responder can bid 3@C, 3@D, and 3@S, all of which are natural and show game forcing values. It is undefined as to whether or not responder has a stopper in the overcalled suit. However, with some partners I play the following. Assume my suit is higher than the overcalled suit (for example I have spades and hearts were overcalled). 

In that case, if I bid 3@S directly I am saying I have game forcing values but I do not have a heart stopper. If I bid 2N first, and then 3@S I am saying I have a game forcing hand with a heart stopper. As you will see below,this use of 2N is different than the way most people play Lebensohl. The more common approach is to play 2N followed by 3S as showing invitational values. Note that I cannot use this approach with a game forcing hand and a suit below the overcalled suit. If, for example, I have game forcing values with diamonds and the overcalled suit is hearts, if I first bid 2N followed by 3@D, then I am saying I want to play in 3@D. So I simply have to bid 3@D whether or not I have a heart stopper.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


AT|

^*BResponder has a 4 card major and game forcing values^*N
A cue bid by responder is Stayman, indicating at least one 4 card major and game forcing values (the cue bid is at the 3 level). However, there are 2 different Stayman sequences. A direct cue bid indicates that responder does not have a stopper in the overcalled suit. A bid of 2N followed by a cue bid indicates that responder does have a stopper (SASS). Note that if the overcalled suit is clubs, the 2 different Stayman sequence approach does not work. That is because opener bids 3C over 2N, so obviously responder is no longer able to cue bid 3@C. So with clubs overcalled, 3C is still Stayman, but whether or not responder has a stopper is undefined.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT|

There is a treatment you can play to address this problem. As will be explained below, double is normally either penalty or competitive. However, over 2@C you can choose to play double as Stayman. If you play that, then 3@C is also Stayman and shows game forcing values but no club stopper. Double may or may not show a club stopper. If you rebid 2N or 3N over partner's response to your double then you have a stopper. If you don't have a stopper, you must be prepared for whatever bid partner makes over your double. Also, with no 4-card major, partner should bid 2@D without a club stopper and 2N with a club stopper.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


AT|

^*BResponder Wishes to Raise to 3N^*N
The only issue to consider is whether or not responder has a stopper in the overcalled suit. With a stopper, responder bids 2N, and bids 3N over opener's forced 3C bid (SASS). With no stopper, responder jumps directly to 3N; if opener does not have a stopper, he bids his lowest 4 or 5 card suit.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


AT|

^*BResponder has a 5 card suit and invitational values^*N
If responder's suit is below the overcalled suit (for example, the overcalled suit is hearts and responder's suit is clubs or diamonds), responder must make a unilateral decision. He can either bid 3 of the suit and force to game, or bid 2N to play a 3 level partial. However, if responder's suit is higher than the overcalled suit (for example, the responder's suit is spades), then he can use the Lebensohl 2N sequence. Over opener's forced 3@C, responder bids 3@S. This shows an invitational hand with spades. Note that with less than invitational values, responder would bid 2@S. 

With game going values, responder would bid 3S directly. So the 2N sequence followed by 3@S specifically shows an invitational hand. Note that I suggested an alternative treatment above where this sequence showed a game forcing hand and a stopper in the overcalled suit. If you play that treatment, there is no way to show an invitational hand even when your suit is higher than the overcalled suit.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT|

^*BResponder has no 5 card suit but would like to compete for a partial^*N
In traditional Lebensohl, double is for penalties. However, I recommend that you play a double by responder as "competitive", showing a balanced hand willing to compete (approximately 8-10 HCP). In general, opener should bid his lowest 4+ card suit in response to the double. On occasion, opener may pass with good defense and length (usually 4+) in the overcalled suit. Some may argue that this approach gives up the ability for responder to punish the opponents for a bad overcall. 

However, in my experience, responder holds a balanced competitive hand much more frequently than a penalty double, so this approach works out better in the long run. There are a couple of variations you can play. One is what I discussed above, where a double of 2@C is Stayman (and a direct 3@C cue bid is Stayman with no stopper but game forcing values). Another is what I call the "2 way double" which I find very effective in match points. If we are not vulnerable the double is competitive. If we are vulnerable the double is penalty. Using this approach I often get the opponents for -200 (down 1 doubled vulnerable) which is usually a top board in match points.|

^-|ht|d|fp||cp|8|AT| ^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|In this section, I will briefly discuss some guidelines for competing when the opponents open a weak 1N. It is certainly possible to play one of the standard conventions, either DONT or Cappelletti. Cappelletti has the advantage of allowing you to make a penalty double. DONT has the advantage of allowing you to more effectively compete at the 2 level; some of the Cappelletti bids (2H, 2S, and 2C when your suit is clubs) force you to the 3 level. Of the two, I have a strong preference for DONT, as it allows you to easily describe more hand types. Giving up the penalty double is not costly as you rarely will get to defend 1N doubled. |
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


AT|

I am not a big fan of Cappelletti. But my feeling is that the best approach is to play simple natural overcalls. I overcall with the same values for a 2-level overcall as I would had the opponents opened 1 of a suit. I use a double to show an equivalent balanced hand. It is neither strictly takeout nor penalty. Partner can pass with 8 or more points, particularly with a balanced hand, but does need to worry about whether we would do better bidding game or setting them doubled. |
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


AT|

With an unbalanced or weak hand, partner should bid their suit. With a strong hand, when partner feels we should be in game rather than penalizing the opponents, he jumps to the 3-level. As a slight modification to the above, you can play "transfer overcalls". These are similar to natural overcalls except your overcalls are a transfer. For example, if you bid 2@D over 1NT, you are saying you have hearts. Partner can either simply accept the transfer (by bidding 2H) or make whatever bid he would have made over a 2@H overcall (such as raising to 3@H or 4@H or bidding a new suit as a forcing bid). I like this approach slightly better than simple overcalls because it gives you a little more flexibility. With a stronger hand, you can make another bid when partner accepts the transfer, including either showing a 2nd suit or raising partner to the 3-level to show a game invitational hand. |
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


AT|

One other approach is called "Mohan". It is a bit complicated. It combines penalty doubles, major suit transfers, and methods to show 1-suited and 2-suited hands. I personally prefer playing the simpler natural (or transfer) overcall method, but Mohan is a reasonable, if somewhat difficult to remember, alternative.|
