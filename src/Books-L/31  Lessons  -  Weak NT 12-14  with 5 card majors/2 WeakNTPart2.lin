^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|This article is the second of three introducing the weak 1NT opening bid (12-14 HCP). In the first article, I discussed uncontested auctions in which there is a weak NT opening. In this article, I discuss how to bid if you play the weak 1NT opener and you hold a strong NT. In the third article, I will discuss how to handle the auction when the opponents compete over your weak 1NT opener. |

^-|ht|d|fp||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|It is actually fairly simple to show a strong NT if you play the weak NT opener. You open 1 of a minor and rebid NT at the cheapest level. For example, if the auction goes| 
ht|g|cs|6|cp|4|at|^B{|ia|,1cp1hp1n|at|}|ht|g|cp||at|^m@2opener is showing a strong NT (15-17 balanced with at least 3 clubs). |

PG| ***** 4 ***** |


ht|t|cp||at|^B@2Many weak NT players play that the 1NT bid shows a balanced hand with 12-14 HCP or so. I played that way for many years. However, this gives opener a problem when he has 15-17 HCP. There is no good way to show that hand. By the way, that is why I strongly recommend to those players who play strong NT that they open 1NT any time they hold 15-17 HCP and a balanced hand even with a 5-card major. My solution is to play it as opener is showing a strong NT (15-17).|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |

ht|b|fp||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at| That does leave the problem of what to do when opener has a 5-3-3-2 hand with 12-14 HCP. I solve that problem using the same method that is used when responding over a forcing 1NT. I rebid a 3-card minor. Therefore, in the following two auctions|

ht|n|cp||AT|^m@2Note this approach is no different than the 2@C/2@D rebid in the forcing NT auctions.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


 
HT|s|at|^B@2There is one other important bidding difference between opening the weak 1N and strong 1N. Playing the weak 1N, you must bypass a 4 card major and rebid 1N in order to show your strength. Thus, if the auction goes,| 
HT|u|cs|6|cp|4|at|^b{|ia|,1cp1hp1n|at|}|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ht|u|CP||AT|^m@2opener may have 4 spades. Do not worry about missing a 4-4 major fit, because there is a method (Checkback Stayman) described below for discovering these fits. |
PG| ***** 10 ***** |

ht|b|fp||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Note that you only bypass a 4 card major if partner does not bid it. Thus, if the auction goes,|

ht|i|cp||at|^B@2Note that playing the weak NT gives you a better picture of the opener's hand after the rebid. For example, if the auction goes as you see below,|
HT|k|cs|6|cp|4|at|^b{|ia|,1cp1hp1s|at|}|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


HT|p|cp||AT|^b@2opener has 4 spades and 5+ clubs. The reason is because, playing the weak 1N opener, you only open 1 of a minor with either an unbalanced hand or a strong balanced hand. Since opener did not bid 1N over 1H, he must have the unbalanced hand. Note the contrast to those who play the strong NT, where you know much less about opener's hand; opener could have as few as 3 clubs. |

NT|^B@2
I do not like to play that for 2 reasons. a) It is inconsistent. And, more importantly, b) If you hold 15-17 and open 1H, you have no way to show your values if a 1NT rebids shows 12-14. So I prefer that even after opening 1H, a 1NT rebid shows 15-17.|

cs|1|ht|b|fp|1|cp|4|at|^-{  Checkback Stayman  }
^-|ht|D|fp||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Before going into detail about how to respond when partner opens one of a minor, I will discuss Checkback Stayman. This is because an understanding of Checkback Stayman is critical to the discussion of responses to one of a minor opening bids. |
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


AT|

Checkback Stayman is used by responder to discover whether an opener who has rebid 1N has either a 4 card major or 3 card support for a major previously bid by responder. The mechanics are simple. Over a 1N rebid by opener, if responder bids 2@C, that is Checkback Stayman (even if the opening bid was 1@C). If opener has a 4 card major, he bids it. Similarly, if opener has 3 card support for the major bid by responder, he bids it. If opener has neither, he bids 2@D.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


AT| 

If opener has both a 4 card major and 3 card support, your partnership needs to decide what the rebid should be. The 3 choices are a) show the 3 card support, b) show the 4 card major, or c) always bid 2H. I personally have a slight preference for showing 3 card support (on the theory that you should "support with support" when you can), but all the choices are equally good. You just need to come to an agreement.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


 
HT|p|cs|6|cp|4|at|^b{|ia|,1cp1DP1NP2C|at|}|HT|p|CP||AT|^m@2For example, the auction on the left is Checkback Stayman, asking opener to show a 4 card major. |
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


HT|u|cs|6|cp|4|at|^b{|ia|,1DP1HP1NP2C|at|}|HT|u|CP||AT|^m@2Similarly, this auction is Checkback Stayman, asking opener to show either 3 card heart support (with 4 hearts opener would have raised hearts) or a 4 card spade suit. |

cs|1|ht|b|fp|1|cp|4|at|^-{  Checkback Stayman  }
^-|ht|D|fp||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Most of the time, responder bids Checkback Stayman with invitational or game forcing values. If responder has a weak hand with one 5+ card major, he simply rebids the major to play. An example of this is the auction below.| 
HT|g|cs|6|cp|4|at|^b{|ia|,1DP1HP1NP2H|at|}|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


cp||AT|

However, responder can also bid "garbage" Checkback Stayman, using the same concepts as discussed in the first article in this series. If responder is short in clubs and has length in the other 3 suits, he may pass any response by opener, including 2@D. If responder has at least 4 cards in each major, intending to pass any major suit response by opener, he can bid 2@H over a 2@D response, asking opener to pass or correct to 2@S with better spades.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


AT| 

Many of you are familiar with the "New Minor Forcing" convention, which is similar to Checkback Stayman. If you use that convention, over a 1N rebid, responder bids the minor suit not opened to check for 3 card support or the other 4 card major. For example the next two auctions,|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


HT|s|cs|6|cp|4|at|^b{|ia|,1CP1HP1NP2D|at|}|HT|s|at|^M{|ia|,1DP1HP1NP2C|at|}|
HT|w|cp||at|^B@2
are both new minor forcing. You may wonder why I recommend Checkback as opposed to New Minor Forcing. The reason is that Checkback gives responder much more flexibility than new minor forcing, particularly with the use of garbage Checkback Stayman.|

cs|1|ht|b|fp|1|cp|4|at|^-{  2 way Checkback  }
^-|ht|D|fp||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Let me mention one other convention that some expert pairs play known as "2 way Checkback" or "2 way New Minor Forcing". If you play that, then both 2@C and 2@D over opener's 1NT rebid are conventional. Just as with regular Checkback, both are asking about opener's major suit holdings. |
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


AT|

2@D is game forcing Checkback whereas 2@C shows an invitational hand at best. The responses over 2@C are identical to those for regular Checkback. The responses over 2@D are more complicated (although opener's first obligation is still to show 3-card support or 4 cards in the other major). I won't go into further details here. The reason for playing this is basically the same as the reasons for playing 2 over 1 game forcing. Once responder bids 2@D, a game force has been established while the bidding is still at a low level. This gives the partnership a lot of room to explore for slam, including minor suit slams that would otherwise be hard to bid.|

cs|1|ht|b|fp|1|cp|4|at|^-{  Responses to One of A Minor Openers  }
^-|ht|D|fp||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|The responses when partner opens one of a minor are more clearly defined when you play weak 1N openers. This is because you must take into account that partner may have a strong NT hand (although a majority of the time opener will have an unbalanced minimum).|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


AT|

One consideration is whether or not to bypass diamonds to bid your 4 card major. Playing strong 1N openers, the modern tendency is to bypass diamonds. However, playing weak NT, this is not always the case. You should bypass diamonds to bid your major if you intend to pass a 1N rebid by opener. However, if you intend to bid Checkback Stayman over the 1N rebid, then you should bid 1D; this will allow any major suit fit you have to be played with the strong hand as declarer.|
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


AT|

Another consideration is the 1N and 2N responses. I recommend you tend to avoid these whenever possible, because you would prefer the contract be played by partner if he has a strong NT. Note that I recommend you still play inverted minors. Therefore, with 10+ points and 4 card support, you should raise to the 2 level; note that, unlike when playing strong 1N openers, this is very safe, because partner either has the strong NT or a 5+ card suit. Over a 1D opener, I will also favor a 2@C bid over a 2N bid if I have a choice; I will often bid 2@C with 3-3-3-4 distribution and 10+ points. With 5 card support and less than 10 points, I recommend you make a jump raise to the 3 level, even if you have a balanced hand. Again, this is very safe and quite effective. Opener often has an unbalanced hand with a 5+ card suit, so you have managed to preempt the opponents. And if partner has the strong NT, playing in an 8+ card fit at the 3 level is fine. |

Although 1@D is possible, I would bid 2@C. This gives partner a better idea about your point count, and also makes it harder for the opponents to find their major suit fit. I would not bid 2N. |

Bid 3@C. You will often have a 10 card fit (if partner opened an unbalanced hand), and 3@C should be reasonable even if partner has a strong NT.|

You must reluctantly bid 1N with this hand, as no other bid is appropriate. |

I would bid 2@C, giving partner a chance to bid 2N. However, 2N is a reasonable alternative.|
