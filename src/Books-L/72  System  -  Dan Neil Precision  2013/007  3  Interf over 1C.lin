at|^b@2djneill: The topic of today's lesson is handling intererence over our 1@c opening.

That is when the opponents overcall our 1@c, or double it, or even overcall over a 1@c - 1@d response

Just to review, 1@c-1@d  is 0-7 HCP

Now, it's not too hard to handle when we have made a positive response
e.g. 1@c - 1@h   (8-11) - and now they bid 2@c

It's still the same idea, we bid our PRIMARY SUITS first, and get to the right game
But we have the extra juicy chance of penalizing the opponents

Whenever we make a POSITIVE response, GAME GOING, doubles are penalty.

So today I'm going to talk about the difficult situation where we don't know if we have game or not.


Let's start with 1@c - (Pass) - 1@d|

The main thing to remember here is:
IF PARTNER COULD HAVE ZERO HCP, PRETEND THEY OPENED :-)
It's not really much harder than that
So here, North pretends West opened 1@s|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||at|
If you recall the NT ladder
1@c opening then cheap NT is 17-19
So that is what 1NT shows
|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||mb|pp|sk|s|at|djneill:  We just proceed as over a 1NT opening
South has 3 HCP
That is not enough for game opposite 17-19, so South Passes

sk||at|djneill:  but West was not done!
East is not that happy
and South can just Pass, surely the opponents are in the throes of a misfit
This probably makes tho
So after 1@c - (P) - 1@d - and 4th seat bids, we pretend they opened
The key again is:  If partner (South) could have zero HCP, we pretend they opened.|

Now, remember, that North has already promised 16+ HCP for the 1@c opening
So North's overcalls are really pretty strong :-)
South can now figure that with 5 HCP, it is pretty good for a 0-7 hand
So South now can bid a PRIMARY SUIT|

Recall the NT ladder, with 20-21, North would open 2NT, like in SAYC
but with 22+, North opens 1@c and then does something strong.
OK now we have to remember, if West opened 1@s  (we are pretending he did)
How would North show a "great hand, too strong to overcall 1NT?
North would double first of course, and *then* bid NT, that shows a REALLY big NT|

Opposite 22-23, that should be enough for game.    South could have had zero HCP for the 1@d response
So North can't just jump to 3NT
But by doubling and then bidding NT, as if West had opened 1@s 
that gave South the info to make the right decision|

That's right, Unusual 2NT|

nt||sk|n|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^6d|mb|6dppp|sk||at|djneill: North is a bit off put by not getting to defend 1@s - X
But let's see
If South has a decent hand with 5-5 minors, 6@d is reasonable

Karen10: But south is not forced to bid after the pass right? When has nothing?
djneill:  Good question - we rarely let the opponents play at the 1-level in bridge, so South should try to say something|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt||at|djneill:  If South had a 4333 2-count, there is indeed nothing to say
But North was so LOOONGGGG in spades, it was clear South would say something.
Karen10: If 5-card, bid no matter what?? :)
djneill:  It depends on shape *and* strength, yes
The freakier the shape, or the better the takeout shape, the fewer HCP you need to bid|

I will mention jump "overcalls" over 1@s now
Clearly if you opened 1@c you are not weak
If they open 1@s, and we bid 3@h that is normally a weak jump overcall
But, having opened 1@c, instead, it means "invite, long good suit"

Remember, North did promise a very good suit
Karen10: Was 3@h forcing?
djneill:  3@h is not forcing, it is invitational to game, requiring a trick or 1.5 tricks
It was difficult to get to this slam|

18 is not much more than 16, and South could have even a doubleton @h (and 1@c)
So it is South's decision, not North's|

Just because you open a strong 1@c does not mean the opponents do not have game
When I began Precision, I would double the opponents in game, because it made no sense, them bidding game over our strong bid
But if you think about it, 16 HCP out of 40 leaves 24 HCP
And these days, games need fewer and fewer HCP :-)|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


nt||at|djneill:  So I would suggest, if the opponents bid game over your strong club, 
don't double them unless you really think they are going down based on your hand.
This hand for instance, West loses 1@d, 1@c, 1@s, without breaking a sweat
But also the strong club is good for another thing
It can scare the opponents into *not* bidding a game
Just like an opening 1NT makes it unlikely the opponents will bid a game.

South's @sQ is likely useless, as both the opponents have bid spades
So it's about 3 HCP
But there is a 9-card diamond fit
Would South raise North's 2@d overcall over a 1@s opening, to compete?|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


at|     YES|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


nt||sk|w|mb|3sppp|sk||at|djneill:  And this was an example of the opponents getting scared out of game 
- maybe West should have bid 4@s, who knows, but the 3@d call made it hard, and North's 16 HCP were imposing
Isabelle10:  How much do you need to jump bid, i.e. 3 diamonds?   (like previous hand)
djneill:  The jump "overcall" by opener over 1@s promises about 8.5 tricks
So maybe 20-22 HCP,    but it promises a very good 6+ card suit|

^b@2djneill:  OK these 10 example hands have been wild and wooly, 
precision makes auctions very fun sometimes.
But the key principles remain:
Bid your PRIMARY suits first
And, if South (1@d responder) could have 0 HCP, we pretend THEY OPENED and bid accordingly.

Isabelle10:  in general does the 1 club opener always try to bid again after interference
djneill:  North could Pass, often with 17-19 BAL and no stopper
Or, if West had bid 2@s, not 1@s, that might silence many North hands for a bit.
But North should strain to bid, the 1@c told nothing about the shape of the hand, it is time to show it.

I will mention that interference against a strong club is the best defense to a strong club
It is important not to sit on your hands when the opponents open 1@c
If you do not overcall, they will tend to find the best contract.

djneill:  Good question came up, isn't North's first Pass over 1@s always a TRAP pass, with long spades?
North could have something like   @s Jxx  @h AKx  @d KQJx  @c KJx
In that case, North would have no bid
So North would just Pass over 1@s
Perhaps North could double, but it's close
southuist:  Because I was wondering how south tells the difference, and how do you alert a trap pass?
Do you alert it?
djneill:  No Pass is alertable in bridge, it's always either "nothing to say" or "trap"
Ok I guess there may be a Pass sometimes but it is rare, that it is alertable.|

^b@2djneill: I would like to go into the hands where EAST overcalls over 1@c DIRECTLY
This is where it gets the most difficult for our intrepid precisioneers

After  1@c - (Pass) - 1@d,  we have at least established responder is weak.
But over IMMEDIATE interference, South is not even limited at all.
Let's see how it works.

The first thing South can do is Pass
Pass always could be a broke hand, weak.
But, it could also be a TRAP
Just like if we opened 1@c in SAYC   and East bid 1@h
If South has 6 hearts, South will Pass, and await a reopening double by North
So this TRAP theory is really just standard SAYC stuff.

How weak is weak?
Well, Pass is about 0-5 HCP
That gives North a warning that things may not be as shiny as hoped.|

If they "opened"  1@h, our  2NT jump  would be unusual 2NT for the minors
So to show the ^*bBIG NT^*n,  we X first,  and then bid NT

But it's always important to cater to this TRAP pass if you can, and double is not too far out of line (takeout)
Notice East's solid gold overcall
So this is how you penalize the opponents when they wander in with fluff|

mb|1h|sk|s|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^x|mb|xp|at|djneill:  South's job is pretty easy with 0-5 HCP, just Pass and do whatever is needed later
Now let's discuss a bit stronger hands
With 6-7 HCP, South ^*bdoubles^*n
It is not a takeout double, it is merely a HCP-showing device
This double goes back to the old days in the 70's    and it is still standard today.|
pg| ***** 97 ***** |


nt||at|djneill:  What does 6-7 HCP mean for the precision pair?
obsugar:  ­game
Karen10: invite
djneill:  If you add 16 to 6-7, you get 22-23 HCP, minimum
Opener could be stronger, so immediately we are in the "near game" zone.|
pg| ***** 98 ***** |


nt||at|djneill:  Right, we are inherently inviting ourselves to game
However, there is a big problem, we have no idea what suits
It goes back to the basics...

nt||sk|n|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^2c|mb|2cp|at|djneill:  Bid your PRIMARY suit first

pg| ***** 101 ***** |


nt||sk|s|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^3c|mb|3cp|at|djneill:  OK so South has to bid something
South could bid a PRIMARY suit (2@d),   or show the stoppers with 2NT
Or maybe raise 3@c
I think 3@c gives partner the most information.

nt||sk|n|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^3s|mb|3sp|at|djneill:  Now North has 17, with a great 6-card suit
And there is a fit in that suit, so it might run at NT
... but wait, there is a SECONDARY suit, a major in fact
By bidding beyond the needed level, North is forcing to game!
The double by South immediately announced game was just around the corner
But it was possible for North to Pass 3@c  => 3@s = GF

If North has 17 and South has 6, and no good fits, game might just not be there.
Here, South has a 5 card diamond suit, but the Jacks are not that good, all by themselves
So South can Pass this 1NT

North had a nice suit, so ignored the "Mathe" majors bid by East.
