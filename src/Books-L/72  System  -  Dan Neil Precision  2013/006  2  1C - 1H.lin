at|^b@2djneill: In this lesson we will go over the  1@c - 1@h sequences
Last time we looked at  1@c - 1@d (0-7 HCP)
That turned out to be a lesson in how to get to the right contract but  not TOO high

This time we will release the brakes, we are going to game!
1@c - 1@h shows   ^*b8-11 HCP, any distribution^*n

If you add 8 to opener's 16, that's 24
Pretty much game values
So  1@c - 1@h is game forcing
But we still don't know anything about any of the hands' shapes!!
We will see how to find the right fit
The main concept in bidding in  1@c - 1@h is that we are going to game!   We can't stop.
So we have lots of room to figure everything out.  Nobody has to jump around

It's important that both sides bid their  ^*bPRIMARY SUIT^*n first
What is a PRIMARY SUIT?
The PRIMARY SUIT is your longest 5+ card suit
If you have 5 spades, 4 hearts, 3 diamonds, and 1 club, your PRIMARY SUIT is spades
So the first suit you would introduce after  1@c - 1@h  is spades.

Lets look at some example hands.      To skip to a next hand use the  ^$41 as usual|

mb|p|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^1h|mb|1H|an|any 8-11  GF|mb|p|at|South has 9 HCP
So that's in the 8-11 range
But in precision, you bid the step response:  1@h
Now North knows we are going to game
and South of course knows we are going to game
|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||sk|n|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^1s|mb|1Sp|at|Now it's time to bid each side's PRIMARY SUIT
North's longest 5+ card suit is spades
So that is the primary suit.
|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||sk|s|at|South now knows there is an 8 card spade fit, at least|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^2s|mb|2Sp|at|So South should raise the spades|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||sk|n|at|OK so North knows there is a 9-card spade fit now
The game we will play will be 4@s, clearly
But could there be more?
If South has 11 HCP, and North has 16, that's 27 with a 9-card fit and a singleton
North could imagine South with the  @dAKQxx and  @sQxx|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^3c|mb|3Cp|at|So I think North might use a little room here to cue-bid
A cue-bid is an Ace, King, singleton, or void
After you have set a major as trumps in a game forcing manner it indicates at least a hint of slam interest
|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||sk|s|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^3d|mb|3Dp|at|South of course must cooperate, in case North is REALLY strong|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||sk|n|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^3h|mb|3Hp|at|North will show the @h cue now, bidding the cues up the line|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt||sk||mb|4Sppp|at|South however is having no more of this - 
3343 is horrible and just 9 HCP, not 11
South cooperated  ....    but it's now over for South
So clearly South has not the hand North wants
It took a while, but we got to game.
|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||at|Major_Blue:  South raised with @SQxx.  What would she do with @Sxxx ?
djneill: Good question Major
If South had xxx, that's still 8 card fit, so South would raise.
Rickc54:  What would  3@s over the  3@h cuebid indicate?
djneill: 3@s over 3@h would indicate a  @sA or  @sK|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||at|The key to this cue-bidding auction is that North ALLOWED for South to have a good 11 HCP, 
and South ALLOWED for North to have a great hand (22+), 
but both sides quickly gave up to show each did not have a good hand.
Again, North bid her PRIMARY SUIT - longest 5+ card suit - first
We will see later how sometimes you don't find a fit, and end up in 3NT|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


nt||at|yleexotee:  Dan, can you give an example of what bid from south could encourage her further?
djneill: If South had a great hand, like  @dAKQxx, South could cue-bid @d AGAIN, showing two controls
South is actually not too far from a  1@c - 1@h - 1@s - 4@s jump - FAST ARRIVAL
Remember, FAST ARRIVAL in a game forcing auction, (jumping to 4 of a major) shows the WORST EVER HAND
Does South have the worst ever 8-11 raise with 3+ spades?|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt||at|It's pretty close :-)      4333 is an abominable shape    @cJ is not proven to be worth anything
Karen10: Any way to show the difference between a 3 or 4 card support?
djneill: No, but if you have a 4-card support, remember, that's the MAGIC BERGEN SPARKLY NINE CARD FIT
The MBSNCF is worth a lot
So in the subsequent auction, you would encourage partner.
Remember, if you raise to  2@s, it could be 3 or 4 -  So make sure you help partner to bid more if possible
The MBSNCF would never bid fast arrival immediately|

mb|p|sk|n|mb|1Np|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


sk|s|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^2c|mb|2Cp|at|Ok at this point, we use normal Stayman and transfers
South assumes North has 17-19
If North has 24+, North will take over later and do something like bid a slam
But 17-19 is the most common
|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt||sk|n|mb|2Dp|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


sk|s|mb|3Nppp|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


sk||at|South has no interest in a minor or anything else, other than 3NT
So South can just leap to 3NT
North has 17-19, no reason to do anything but Pass
In SAYC, North would open 1NT and South would bid just the same as here - Stayman followed by 3NT
This is a very analogous sequence to SAYC, should be easy to remember.|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt||at|1@c - 1@d - 1NT  also uses Stayman and transfers if you recall
So  1@c - 1@d - 1NT and    1@c - 1@h - 1NT   proceed all the same way
The only difference is that responder the first time is 0-7 and the second sequence 8-11
Also, if anyone plays step responses to 2@c in SAYC,  where 2@c-2@d  is 0-3,  2@c-2@h  is 4-6, etc, 
this is very similar to this point.
In this example nobody bid a PRIMARY SUIT because North did not have one! A PRIMARY SUIT must be 5+ or more cards.
But, North would rebid 1NT also with  5 of a minor and 5332 shape|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt||at|Isabelle10:  So, if its 5 of minor and balanced do you still bid primary or NT?
djneill: If the hand would open 1NT, it is very often correct to rebid NT too
In general the balanced hand, not the unbalanced hand, should be declaring too.   Why?
Because the unbalanced hand has a singleton
If you play 3NT, and they lead the singleton, you want the hand guarding that suit to be declaring 
to protect it from the lead
So very often,  1NT is a great rebid if you are balanced|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt||at|Karen10: Would you rebid NT with the range and a 5- card major?   Or always the major?
djneill:  With 5 of a major, and (332) shape, you can optionally bid either 1NT or the major.
It is not as important here,  because the main reason to OPEN 1NT with 5332 (in sayc or 2/1)
is because the system cannot find out that hand otherwise.
But in  1@c - 1@h    we are already going to game!    There is no big reason to hide your major|

nt||sk|s|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^2h|mb|2hp|at|This time South does not have 3+ spades
South in turn bids her PRIMARY SUIT
|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt||sk|n|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^3h|mb|3hp|at|Now opener has 3+ hearts, nice
Should North bid  3@h or  4@h, I wonder,  or maybe  4@d ?|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


at|
4@d really should have 4+ trumps      (Splinter)
So the question is whether North's hand "qualifies" as the WORST EVER HAND
Well, 3 Aces and a singleton is not bad
but it does just have 3 trumps and 16 HCP|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt||at|I think it's close but we'll go with 3@h
So we know what trumps is now!
There is an 8+ card heart fit
|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


nt||sk||mb|4hppp|at|So  4@h is the game we will play, unless there is something more
South has 9 HCP, and just 5 trumps
Also, the @cQ is unproven, and the @dJ is nothing amazing.
But the @sK could be quite valuable to North
So the question is whether to CUE-BID, or just sign off in  4@h ?
Again very close|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt||at|I think 4@h is not a bad call here
OK, so in SAYC this hand might be a problem....
North would open 1@s      South would respond 1NT
North would rebid 2@c      and South is stuck in the middle ground
Bid  2@h on a flimsy 5-card suit?
Most likely South would rebid 2@s, and you have lost the heart suit.
So Precision scores well in the 16+ HCP range|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt||at|As long as the opps don't bid :-) 
(we will discuss that next week)
So the first hand, OPENER bid the primary suit and there was a fast fit
This time, RESPONDER bid her primary suit and there was a fit there.

nt||mb|2Hp|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^3n|mb|3Np|sk|n|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^p|mb|pp|at|North actually might just Pass this, assuming South is flat
If South was not flat...   South had loads of room to bid 2NT (waiting).... or bid a minor (5-5 shape)
So North can reasonably Pass this|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt||sk||at|4@h is pretty difficult but 3NT has chances
In general, 5332 opposite 4333 in an 8-card fit plays better in 3NT, or at least as well, as 4 of the major
Of course if a suit is not stopped, that could hurt
But North is pretty solid in the side suits
So   1@c - 1@h - 1NT proceeds just like a 1NT opening.|

This time, North's primary suit is not a major at all
but it is a good one|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt||sk|s|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^2n|mb|2Np|at|South has no primary suit of her own
She has 3 baby diamonds, but a flat hand
South could choose  2NT here, or  3@d
The way to tell is where the honors are - here South has honors in 2 side suits
Also, 4333 is a NT shape, not a @d shape
So I would try 2NT with South's hand.
|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt||sk|n|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^3s|mb|3Sp|at|OK, we have discussed the PRIMARY suits
Time for the SECONDARY suit.
The secondary suit is the next-longest 4+ card suit
Sometimes you will have two 5+ card suits - in that case, the higher suit is the primary and the lower is the secondary
So in this way,  you can find a 4-4 major fit, even if the primary suits struck out.
|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


nt||sk|s|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^3n|mb|3Nppp|sk||at|Now South has a judgement call -  4@d or  3NT
My view is that 3NT is where you want to be if there is any doubt between 3NT and 5 of a minor
So that would explain why North is also going to Pass 3NT
You may have heard this mentioned somewhere as "Hamman's Rule"
|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


nt||at|yleexotee:  Dan, because 3@s was bid second it guarantees 4 spades. 
But if the hand was 6-5 diamonds-spades... "could" it be 5 spades?
djneill: Good question, if North had 6@d's and 5@s's,    would not North still bid the same way?
Well, in that case, North can rebid  4@s over 3NT.|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


nt||at|wyoming33: With possible 24 HCP is 5 of minor likely to make? Of course going to have distribution to figure in
djneill:  Yes  5@d might make here
The fewer HCP you have,  the harder it is to make an 11 trick contract
So with 24 I would be much more apt to try 3NT than 5@d
But with 29 HCP  5@d becomes not so hard
But either way, 3NT should have a shot|

pg| ***** 63 ***** |


nt||sk|s|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^3s|mb|3Sp|at|South now can implement a SPLINTER jumpshift
In a game forcing auction, jumpshifts are not strong hands (we already know strength)
Jumpshifts are splinters for the last-bid suit
It also promises a 9+ card fit
|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


nt||sk|n|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^4c|mb|4Cp|at|So North definitely is interested.
However, you must know, that a splinter can hurt a little too
If North has secondary honors (K, Q, J) in the splinter suit, that honor is devalued
So North's @sK goes down in value
Still, North has an ok hand, 18 HCP, not 16
3 Aces, and the trump Queen      5-4 shape    so North should cooperate I think
North can try a CUE-bid of 4@c|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


nt||sk|s|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^4d|mb|4Dp|at|South must cooperate
|
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


nt||mb|4Hppp|sk||at|But North can now sign off
North showed a little courtesy interest, but no more
South has just 8 HCP, not 11      so South can Pass too
Before North asks to see dummy, we note that South is declarer!
Precision sometimes results in this "dummy reversal" in hearts
because  1@c - 1@h  is artficial :-)|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


nt||at|In this case, slam depends on the 3-3 @d break, 
but of course that is against the odds
Note that even if the @sAce is onside, it makes not a difference
What a poor fate for the @sK
That is why the splinter can make a hand worse

As discussed, two 5 card suits - the higher one is the primary
It's very similar to how you are taught to open the higher of two 5 card suits in SAYC

nt||sk|s|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^2n|mb|2Np|at|South now has an interesting choice
True, South has 5 clubs, the primary suit...   but look at the honor distribution
Honors in every suit...    also, 2 hearts
This is a very NT-oriented hand
I think 2NT is a fine rebid|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


nt||sk|n|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^3d|mb|3Dp|at|Now North can introduce the 5 card diamond suit|

nt||sk|s|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^3s|mb|3Sp|at|And South can bid 3@s in case North is 4540|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


nt||sk|n|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^3n|mb|3Nppp|sk||at|So should North rebid  4@d or 3NT,  or perhaps 4@h ?
Again it comes back to the 3NT vs anything else dilemma
3NT is the correct call in most cases
So this is an easy contract|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


nt||at|South could have tried 3@c over 2@h, 
but most likely 3NT is the final contract.
yleexotee:  Dan so with two side 4-card suits, bid the lower?
djneill: Yes

pg| ***** 94 ***** |


nt||sk|s|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^3d|mb|3Dp|at|What you do here is up to you - do you play Puppet Stayman?  That's fine
How do you show  5@h's and 5@s's in your system?  That is whatever you see fit
Here, South's plan was to transfer to @h, then bid 3@s,   to show 5-5
With  5@h's and 4@s's   South would have used Smolen
The reason you want to transfer to  @h first then bid @s, is so you can make slam tries below game.
If you transfer to  @s  then bid 4@h,  you silence partner.

pg| ***** 97 ***** |


nt||sk|s|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^4n|mb|4Np|at|South adds 9 HCP to partner's 22-23, and gets 31-32
But there is a 9-card fit, since North superaccepted.
As you know, with a 9-card fit you only need 29-30 HCP for slam
South duly bids RKC

pg| ***** 99 ***** |

sk||mb|6Hppp|at|So 1 keycard is missing and South thus signs off in 6@h

So it's a nice slam.  The superaccept really made South's hand zing

sk|n|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^3d|mb|3Dp|at|OK, so North's longest suit is @c, not @d
So North bids 2@c to start and diamonds is the secondary suit
At this point, North can take stock.
North's hand has 2 losers - the little @h, and a @d
The chance that South does NOT cover any of those losers,  with 8-11 HCP, is small
The challenge then is to find grand slam if it is right|

pg| ***** 108 ***** |


sk|n|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^4d|mb|4Dp|at|As we mentioned earlier, North can rebid the secondary suit twice to indicate an extra card
But if the secondary suit was ABOVE the primary suit, and it has 5 cards, 
then the primary suit must have... SIX cards
So North is showing  6@c's and 5@d's
|
pg| ***** 110 ***** |


nt||sk|s|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^5c|mb|5Cp|at|At this point, South knows that there are two 8 card minor fits
Also, South knows that the  @cJT and  @dT are very useful
The  @hK, who knows     the @sAce is probably useful
So South probably should just bid 5 of a minor, since there is nothing "extra" about the hand
If South had lots of goodies, like the  @dQ, South probably would have cue-bid a major
So South is not showing an amazing fitting hand
|
pg| ***** 112 ***** |


nt||sk|n|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^6c|mb|6Cppp|sk||at|North can't count 13 tricks for sure, so just bids 6@c
This grand depends on the @d hook
In SAYC, North would open 2@c,   South might wait with 2@d
North would rebid 3@c....it's difficult
North might bash to a slam but there is no intelligent way to bid the hands in SAYC or 2/1
Precision again works best|
pg| ***** 114 ***** |


nt||at|On other layouts, grand would easily be reached, 
since North is showing  6@s and 5@d's at the 3-level
It also helped North to know South had 8-11 HCP

South has 9, including a side 5-card suit, adding it up, that's 31-32 HCP
If North has a "good" hand for slam, it could be there
So South uses the GIB system bid of 4@h to show a "slamtry 4@s raise"

nt||sk|n|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^4n|mb|4Np|at|North has a fantastic hand for slam
3 sets of AK's,   a doubleton      and the black jacks are proven values
The @sJ is not alone, South has 4 spades

South shows zero kings (obviously per North) and North can give up at this point
True, South might have the @sAKQ and a @cQ or @hQ for the 11 HCP
But if South had 11, would not South have bid RKC herself over 3@s?|
pg| ***** 127 ***** |


nt||at|In general, if 13 tricks can't be counted for sure, it's best to stop in 6
This was a very similar auction to a SAYC auction
The only difference was the  1@c - 1@h start
In SAYC it might go  2@c - 2@h - 3@h-... and similar result

nt||sk|n|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^4n|mb|4Np|at|North has finished the description, shape-wise, of her hand
South has 8-11, North has 23 with a great 6-card suit
So that's 31-34 HCP, it seems likely that slam is there
If there are 33-34 HCP, the power should suffice
If there are 31-32 HCP, the spades might set up
North could try a quantitative 4NT to ask South if she is min or max,   or just blast

pg| ***** 137 ***** |


nt||sk|s|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^6n|mb|6Nppp|sk||at|So this works well, with spades setting up

pc|cj|sk||at|North has 20 HCP, should she bid again?
If South has 8-11, that is 28-31 total - but there is no fit!
Without a fit, you need 33 HCP for slam (or a running long suit), so 3NT is the limit
South likes the club lead, and West thought he was being sneaky.

nt||at|djneill: OK that was the last hand of this session
 *throws eraser at sleepers in back*
For next Friday, Feb 21 4pm Eastern, we will go over the looming shadow over our 1@C opening:  interference.  
You should study pp 9-10 (interference over 1@C-1@D) and 19-22 (interference over 1@C) in your book.  
It is definitely worth a full lesson to go over.  
So many players play precision and fall to pieces when the opponents bid.  
Thankfully we will learn some tips and techniques to survive.  Precision can be quite imprecise!|
