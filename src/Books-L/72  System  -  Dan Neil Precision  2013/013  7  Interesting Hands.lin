at|^b@2^*bdjneill:^*n  Today our final session is just a run through of hands that occurred and how precision worked - cherry picked hands :-)

Karen10: Dan with which partners do you always play precision on bbo so we can kib?
djneill:  shaji, foobar, paulatl
djneill:  and pauli on another website I will not name :-)
Karen10: OK :)

cdt: Is this the only form of precision you play?

djneill:  There are other ways brewed up by various mad scientists, I do play a few other ways, but as you will see today, it's the general idea of limited openings that works so well in any precision system

The thing that ties all precision systems together is:  limited openings, strong club

Standard modern precision is the one that is going around all the top players now and will be used by more of "us".

sk||at|djneill:  In SAYC or 2/1, East might feel obligated to bid one more here
West could have 14-16 HCP, with a bad suit, e.g.
But as you can see on this real deal, North was lying in wait
If East pushes higher, the contracts are doomed|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|djneill:  But here, East knows that West is 11-15... and probably 11-13 since West did not jump to 3@s
so any game is marginal to horrible
Therefore, East can just Pass
Isabelle10:  When would opener jump to 3 spades? 
djneill:  1@s - 1NT - 3@s   shows about 14-15 HCP and a good suit|

mb|pp1D|an|could be short|at|djneill:  When playing Precision, you can count on partner opening *any* 11 HCP hand
Even some 10's, especially not vulnerable
So when North got this hand favorable vulnerability in 3rd seat, North knew it was really the opponents' hand
North opened 1@d, but was light.

If I have a ratty 6 and partner is 11-15, it's probably their hand
But rather than Pass, I went with a noise-making 1@s

If South had a good hand with just 4 spades, South could have bid 3@d over 2@d e.g., and maybe ended up 3NT

sk|s|mb|pp|at|djneill:  On this hand, we have to remember that opener of 1@d is most likely 11-13 BALANCED
So let's see what South knows:  North has 4 trumps and is 11-13 BALANCED
South has an Aceless 11, balanced, 4333
South downgraded the hand accordingly by about a point
So with 10 opposite 11-13, is it really worth it to try for game if both hands are balanced?|

nt||sk|s|mb|p2H|an|5+ @h's, 12+ HCP|at|djneill:  South is too strong for a 1@h  (8-11 HCP any hand) response
So South shows the PRIMARY SUIT fast, with 12+ HCP
|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


nt||sk|n|mb|p2S|at|djneill:  North bids a primary suit too|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |

pg| ***** 88 ***** |


nt||sk|n|mb|p4S|at|djneill:  North as a minimum with long good spades, and the misfit doesn't make it any better, 
so North just leaps to 4@s|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


nt||sk|s|mb|p4N|at|djneill:  South has 15, opposite 16, so 31 is not automatically slam
However, South is all Aces and Kings, which adds half a point
Further, South's @h might set up for extra tricks
South tries RKC

But are there 13 tricks?
South asks for the number of Kings
|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


nt||sk|n|mb|p6D|an|1|at|djneill:  North now knows South has all the side Aces, else no reason to ask for Kings
But there still are 2 club losers to handle, so North cannot leap to grand herself
|
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


nt||sk|s|mb|p7S|at|djneill:  South can count probably 7 spades, 2 hearts, 2 minor Aces, and one of North's Kings
That's 12 tricks.
But there is a side chance that North has a working Queen (@h, or maybe the Queen with her King)
Finally, there is a chance that the @h will set up for an extra trick - 
e.g. if north has a singleton or doubleton heart|
pg| ***** 94 ***** |


nt||at|Karen10: only 12 pts accounted for so far
djneill:  that too|
pg| ***** 95 ***** |


sk||at|
North has promised 16 HCP for the 1@c opening, yet @sAKQ and a King is just 12 HCP
There must be 4 more HCP working somewhere
In this case, the @dQ works well|

at|djneill:  In SAYC or 2/1, you may have problems even getting to just small slam
North opens 1@s, and South can't be sure of both the HCP total and the quality of the spades
Precision got it all across by the nature of the 1@c opening and North's jump to 4@s|

With just 12 HCP, out of 11-15, that seems a bit ludicrous

If it is an overbid, it's not much of one

djneill:  Yes in SAYC or 2/1, North may rebid 2@d or 2@h, but we would rarely guess North would be able to jump rebid 3@h
That would show about 15-17 HCP
But precision lets you jump more accurately|

1@s is not great, but if North bids 1@c precision, it may get too high easily

Crossruffing the whole hand gives 1 trumps, 7 ruffs, 2 spades, 2 clubs, and 1 heart for more than enough tricks, 
but might there be an overruff?
How many clubs does North need to ruff with dummy's @d's?|

1 can go on the spade hopefully, one on the heart
so 2 club ruffs are needed 
If diamonds are 2-2, it's cold then (2 trumps left to ruff)|
