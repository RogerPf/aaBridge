Shows the values for game but concern about one of the other suits, usually ^*bDiamonds^*n, but occasionally about a Major. 

Stops are bid upwards from this point. 

If, however, Responder is a passed hand or it is clear that game values may not be present

(eg: in a 1 Club sequence with a negative response), then this sequence simply shows a 5-card or longer (usually at least 6-card) Club suit with a 4-card major, and is just "to play".

ht|f|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Hi Everyone and welcome to today's Precision Club session, in which the plan is that we'll be looking at sequences over a 1NT Openings. 

 If you have not already done so, please have a look at the notes I have prepared on Precision Club bidding.

You can find these on: ^*hhttp://ocp.pigpen.org.uk^*n  

In particular, you might want to have the 1NT Page up on view during the session: ^*hhttp://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/1n.php^*n


|fp|t-title|at|The  1 NT  Opening|fp||at|

The topic today is not exactly "Precision-specific" in that what I'm going to deal with could apply equally to ACOL, Standard American, 2/1 or any other system.

Consequently, don't be afraid to sit and play if you're not yet "into" Precision, although the example hands do assume a Variable 1NT Opening 10-12 non-vul and 13-15 vul, because that is what our Precision system uses.

Similarly, the scheme of responses that you play over a Precision Opening 1NT bid does not really affect any part of the system, and so you are free to use whatever scheme of responses you like.

What I am going to show you today is simply my preferred scheme.
|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  In standard Precision Club, 1NT is opened with any hand containing 13-15 points which is either: 

4432, 4333 or 5332 shape with a 5-card MINOR (NOT a Major).

Like the 1@D and 2@C Openings, the precision 1NT Opening specifically DENIES holding a 5-card Major, but I'll come back to that in a minute.
^k|ih|SaT9HT54DA872CAT9|at|

|ht|h|at|^c@2So this hand is a perfectly  
okay non-vulnerable 1NT Opening 
(if a bit less than ideal).
^b@2^^^^
A 1NT Opening is HUGELY preemptive, however, so in the system I play we use a VARIABLE 1NT Opening 
^c@210-12  when we're NOT vulnerable and 
13-15  when we   ARE vulnerable.

^b@21@D is used to Open Balanced hands that do NOT qualify for a 1NT Opening because of vulnerability/point range
^c@213-15  when NOT vulnerable, and 
11-12  when Vulnerable.

^b@2Please note that we do  NOT  open 10-point  balanced hands when vulnerable. 


In practice, you can play any strength No Trump you like with Precision, but if the top of your No Trump range is higher than 15 points, it does affect the requirements for your 1@C Opening.

Some Precision pairs, for example, use a 14-16 1NT so for them a 1@C Opening is 17+ if balanced.
|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Precision makes no distinction between hands that do or don't contain a weak doubleton.

Semi-balanced hands with a 5-card major are NOT opened with 1NT, however, even if they are relatively weak.

An honourless suit, however, such as @H97642 might be opened with 1NT if the rest of the hand was semi-balanced ie: treat it as a 4-card suit.

Ok, that's about the only Precision-specific part of the lesson.  As I said at the start, you can fit literally ANY scheme of responses that you like over a Precision 1NT Opening or any other system's natural 1NT Opening, for that matter, since it does not affect the REST of the system in the slightest.

If, therefore, you wish to play McGruders 2nd variation in E Minor or Reverse Double-Barrelled 2-way Marionette Stayman, then please be my guest (and may God have mercy on you <grin>).

What range NT you play DOES affect other things (the 1@C and 1@D Openings mainly) so do think about the implications before you stray from a 13-15 strength.

Before we get going, is there ANYONE here who has NEVER played any kind of transfers before? I'm hoping most of you have, but assume that some of you might not have played full 4-suit transfers yet.

The original definition of Precision specifies the use of 2-way Stayman, ie: 

^d@21NT - 2@C  is non-forcing ordinary Stayman
1NT - 2@D  is FORCING Stayman
1NT - 2@H  is a natural weak takeout, and
1NT - 2@S  is also a natural weak takeout.

^b@2I have never liked this scheme (and very few Precision pairs use it) and I do not propose to teach it to you.

Firstly it is inefficient and does not give the flexibility that transfers afford.  Secondly it is complex but to no great effect, in my view.
|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Instead, I will outline the scheme for Normal but non-promissory Stayman and 4-way Transfers, and suggest next week one innovation that I and an old partner of mine came up with about 38 years ago, which you may wish to try, a 2-way 2@D response.

1NT - 2@C   is Stayman.

I'm not going to go into the basic mechanics of Stayman as it is normally the very first convention that any newcomer to Bridge is taught.

Later on today I will spend a little time on the differences in meaning between sequences that use Stayman and those that use transfers ie: where you end up showing 5+ cards in one major and 4-cards in the other.

I mentioned "non-promissory" Stayman earlier.

This is the norm when using 4-way transfers where 1NT - 2NT is a transfer to Diamonds.

"Non-promissory" simply means that 1NT-2@C does NOT guarantee that Responder holds a 4-card Major at all, since raises to 2NT have to go VIA Stayman  (because 1NT - 2NT is a transfer to Diamonds).


One aspect of Stayman is often forgotten, to the bidder's detriment.

There is only ONE requirement for the use of Stayman and it is this: If you decide to use Stayman, you MUST be in a position to cope sensibly with ANY of the 3 possible responses.

In general, if any one of those responses would "fix" you, then you should not use Stayman at all.
|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  There is, therefore, no minimum point count necessary to use Stayman eg: a hand like 
  @Sxxxx   @Hxxxxxx   @Dx   @Cxx     is very suitable for use with Stayman, because over 2@D responder bids 2@H, and they pass if Opener bids either Major in response to the Stayman enquiry.

What you MUST consider before using Stayman is this: If ANY of the 3 possible responses to Stayman would embarrass you and leave you without a sensible course of action, then you can bet your bottom dollar that that is what Opener will respond, and you should NOT use Stayman at all.

Suppose partner opens a 13-15 1NT and you hold    @SQJ7x  @HKJTx  @Dx  @CJTxx 

This is NOT a hand on which to use Stayman: A 2@H or 2@S rebid by Opener will be fine, but a 2@D response will leave you with nowhere safe to go since you do not have enough strength to bid 2NT over 2@D.


|
fp|t-title|at|1NT  -  The Core responses|fp||at|

The full scheme I'm going to suggest is as follows:-
|lg|m|n^|9|at|^c@2
1NT - 2@C      Stayman
1NT - 2@D      Transfer to   @H's     ^*bOR^*n   a balanced invitation (2-way 2@D covered NEXT week)
1NT - 2@H      Transfer to   @S's
1NT - 2@S      Transfer to   @c's
1NT - 2NT    Transfer to   @d's
|lg||at|
1NT - 3@C/@D/@H/@S        ^*bAlpha^*n  in the suit bid.   (But f@2or now you can play Either a 6+ card suit worth an invitation,   OR  a Game Force    -   YOU choose)
|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Just in case some of you have never yet used Transfers (and, amazingly, such people are more numerous than you might imagine) I will just outline the way transfers work and the reason they are so effective and popular: Transfers work by injecting an extra round of bidding.

Instead of bidding YOUR suit, you bid the suit below that and this in turn asks your PARTNER to bid your suit for you.

You are then free to pass or bid on depending on your strength.

They also facilitate Opener's hand being Declarer, which is often an advantage.

Thus 1NT-2@H requests that partner bids 2@S.

If you have a weak takeout, you simply pass over 2@S.

If you have a semi-balanced hand with 5-card spades that is at least worth an invitation, then you can bid NT's at the appropriate level to show this.

Alternatively you can invite or bid game in spades, or show a second suit if you hold one.

This is more flexible than a scheme where 1NT - 2@S is a weak-takeout and 1NT - 3@S is game-forcing.

Moreover, it increases the chance that the 1NT bidder who will normally have the stronger hand will end up as declarer with their strength hidden.

Transfers normally guarantee that you hold at least a 5-card suit in the suit you're transferring into.|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  So  1NT - 2@H  requests that partner bids 2@S.

If you have a weak takeout, you simply pass over 2@S.

If you have a semi-balanced hand with 5-card spades that is at least worth an invitation, then you can bid NT's at the appropriate level to show this.

Alternatively you can invite or bid game in spades, or show a second suit if you hold one.

The key to transfers is the extra round of bidding that they generate.

Since you ask partner to bid your suit for you, you can use this mechanism with ANY hand with a 5-card or longer suit, whatever strength, and then pass, invite, force, show a second suit, bid No Trumps, or whatever, as appropriate.

My advice, for what it's worth, is that I would pretty much ALWAYS transfer into a 5-card Major, even if semi-balanced.

The only time I would perhaps pause for thought is a completely honourless 5-card suit in a semi-balanced hand with scattered values outside.

Where Minors are concerned, I would normally only bother to transfer into a Minor if it was a 6-card suit and I was weak or at least slam-invitational. 

^*bOR^*n  if I had a game-going hand with a 4-card Major AS WELL.  If I was transferring into 3@C or 3@D and intending to rebid 3NT afterwards, I might as well just bid 3NT straightaway if only interested in game.


Any questions? 

ok, a couple more examples

fp|t-title|at|Breaking the Transfer|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Partner can "break" the transfer with an exceptionally suitable hand ie: maximum with good support for your suit.

Thus the sequence 1NT - 2@H(Xfer to @S) - 3@C would probably show a maximum 1NT, good 4-card support for
@SSpades@S and first-round control of Clubs, ie: the Ace. 

Another method for breaking transfers is to show a "worthless" doubleton if you have one, instead of cue-bidding your cheapest outside Ace.

Both methods work ok.


In this system we tend to cue-bid our cheapest Ace over 1NT - 2@H, but for various reasons we show worthless doubletons over 1NT - 2@D if the Diamond is 2-way (More on that next week).


Transfers should NEVER EVER be "broken" out of weakness or a lack of support for partner's suit.

If, for example, you've had a brainstorm and opened 1NT with  @SAx  @Hxx  @DKxx  @CKQJxxx  and the bidding goes
1NT - 2@D - ??   you must not bid 3@C just because you don't like Hearts.

For all you know partner might be sat there with @hAKQxxxx.

nt|^b@2^z@3|at|^^^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Responder  is  ALWAYS  Captain|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  In a 1NT sequence, RESPONDER is ABSOLUTELY and ALWAYS the Captain of the hand.

The 1NT Opener should stick to all these criteria, however, because partner may have a very weak hand and not be remotely interested in game.

Breaking the transfer inevitably means that you must play this contract at least at the 3-level.

But breaking the transfer like this can get you to some excellent very thin games, especially when Responder has a reasonable 6 or 7-card Minor and you have a fit.


As I said before, there are 2 common methods when breaking transfers to a MAJOR: 

You can either cue-bid your CHEAPEST 1st-round Control ie: Ace, 

OR you can show a "useless doubleton" ie: xx which will give partner some indication where your HCP are by a process of elimination and give them an idea of how well the hands are fitting.


Both of these methods are fine and both are BETTER than simply raising to 3 of partner's Major rather than 2, which tells them absolutely NOTHING extra about your hand.

pg| ***** 79 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|at|^^^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  The 2@S transfer to @CClubs@C and 2NT transfer to @DDiamonds@D are treated slightly differently -

in that breaks in the transfer are normally shown by bidding the INTERVENING denomination 

eg: 1NT - 2@S(Xfer to @C) - 2NT   or   1NT - 2NT(Xfer to @D) - 3@C   rather than bidding something else.


As with many things in Bridge, some people do play this the other way around, so bidding the intervening bid is "normal" and completing the transfer is showing max with good support.

Whatever floats your boat is fine, but personally, I definitely feel the first option is better.


Breaking the transfer over 2@S and 2NT is normally showing that Opener WOULD accept an invitation to play in 3NT.

Opener should always be maximum and their support for the minor should be AT LEAST as good as Hxx, and best if it is HHx or better, as then the chances of running 6 tricks in the minor is hugely increased.

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Ok, back to Stayman.

The more astute of you will by now have realised that if  1NT - 2NT  is a transfer to DIAMONDS then -

How do you invite partner to 3NT   with a balanced 13-14 opposite a 10-12 1NT, 

OR  with a balanced 10-11 points opposite a 13-15 1NT Opening? 

The answer is that you HAVE to go via Stayman (or the 2-way 2@D as we'll see next week).


Since we use an almost identical system of responses when Opener ends up rebidding 2NT to show a strong balanced hand, the same applies there  - raise to 3NT have to go via Puppet Stayman since  ...2NT - 3NT is a transfer to Diamonds.

The effect of this is that the use of Stayman does NOT promise possession of a 4-card Major hence the term "Non-promissory Stayman" and this does have an effect on the Stayman sequences.

If you are not using 4-suit transfers then a sequence like  1NT - 2@C - 2@H - 2NT  suggests that Responder has a 4-card SPADE suit and Opener will inevitably bid 3@S or 4@S if they also have one.

This is not the case in this system of responses.

If responder has 4-card Spades and NOT 4-card Hearts, then over  1NT - 2@C - 2@H  they rebid 2@S to show the Spades and a hand worth at least an invitation.

nt|^b@2^z@3|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  So when should you use Stayman and when Transfers, if you appear to have a choice?  Well there are a number of choices, but the main thing to aim for is a system of responses that is entirely consistent and intuitive.

The main area of choice is when you have one 4-card Major and one 5-card or longer Major:

If you transfer to one suit and then show a second suit, this is ALWAYS game-forcing (or perhaps just invitational if you are a passed hand). 

So a sequence like  1NT - 2@H - 2@S - 3@H  is 100 percent game-forcing with 5-card or longer Spades and 4-card or longer Hearts.

That in a nutshell demonstrates the difference between Staymanic sequences and ones using transfers, especially where both majors are shown.    Therefore -

1NT - 2@C - 2@D - 2@S  is a weak takeout with 4-card hearts and 5+-card spades.

1NT - 2@C - 2@D - 3@H  shows an INVITATIONAL hand with 4-card spades and 5-card or longer hearts.

1NT - 2@H - 2@S - 3@H  shows a game-forcing hand with 4-card or longer hearts and 5-card or longer spades.

You can choose to use the SMOLEN convention here if you like whereby 

1NT - 2@C - 2@D - 3@H  shows 4-card Hearts and 5-cards or longer SPADES, invitational strength, and

1NT - 2@C - 2@D - 3@S  shows 4-card Spades and 5-card or longer HEARTS.

Personally, I'm not a great fan of Smolen, but it's for you to choose.

It doesn't impact on the rest of the system.

pg| ***** 147 ***** |


bt||
nt|^b@2^z@3|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  As we'll see next week, we actually have TWO ways of making a balanced invitation to game, one involving Stayman, as we've seen this week, and one involving the 2-way 2@D response, as we'll see next week 

kritter2:  It is not as valuable (when playing weak no trumps) to play Smolen ?

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Indeed, which is one of the reasons I seen no huge advantage for Precision users.

In our case, the Staymanic method is a MILD invitation and the invitation using the 2-way 2@D is a STRONGER invitation More of that next week Last lap: Given the availability of transfers, the need to keep 3-level jump-shifts for game-forcing hands is greatly reduced.

Super-Precision uses these bids to initiate Asking Bid sequences, but in the absence of these, you might like to consider using these for UNBALANCED single-suited hands with at least a 6-card suit, definitely not interested in playing in No Trumps, that are nonetheless worth a mild invitation.

If you adopt these methods and ONLY if, then the implications of a sequence such as  
1NT - 2@D - 2@H - 3@H  is that either the hearts are only 5-card in length or responder IS happy to consider playing in No Trumps opposite a good hand.  Ultimately you have to work out the meanings of these different sequences with your partner.

Lastly In this system, we also use Texas Transfers  1NT - 4@D  and  1NT - 4@H  to show game-going hands with a 6+-card Major.

The upshot of this is that a sequence such as  1NT - 2@H - 2@S - 4@S  is a mild slam try, since a hand only interested in game would bid   1NT - 4@h - 4@S.

Similarly a sequence such as  1NT - 2@S - 3@C - 3NT  is a mild slam try, since a hand only interested in game would just bid   1NT - 3NT.

Any questions?

An easy mistake in reply to an Epsilon is when, say, you hold ^*b Q76 ^*n in the suit, and so give only ^*b Qxx ^*n in the alert.   THAT  IS  WRONG.  The agreement is ^*b 3rd round control ^*n and that is what should be told to the opps.   

The ^*b ethical ^*n problem with telling too much to your opps is that it disadvantages the other pairs who will play your opponents cards.|

at|^^^^OK, so a transfer to Spades and then left in it.  An alternative here is Stayman and then bidding 2@S over 2@D

which would show 5+card Spades and 4-card  Hearts.

at|    As we'll see next week, we use the Stayman invitation when we want Opener to be  "MAXIMUM",  and the invitation via the 2-way 2@D if we want Opener to be  "BETTER THAN MINIMUM". 

Hopefully you'll see the critical difference. Here East wants West to be a 15-count to bid 3NT

If via the 2-way 2@D, (covered next week) then East would want West to have anything better than a bare 13
but this may well make.

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  So the 2-way 2@D can get you to Minor suit games and slams when Stayman will not.

It allows you to explore for slam at the 2-level rather than the 4-level Hopefully that little example will have whet your appetites fpr next week's session Okay, we're going to leave it there for tonight

Any of you new to Transfers will have had enough by now, and there's probably some new material to consider even if you do currently use Transfers

Please do check out the notes on the website          ^*hhttp://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/1n.php^*n

As well as full coverage of what we've discussed tonight, you will find Articles on NT sequences and a lively Discussion Forum with discussions on Precision.

Next session we'll be having a look at the 2-way 2@D Response to 1NT, the innovation I mentioned earlier.

Whether you're serious about Precision or not, I would really suggest that you come along and that that will be worth the investment of your time.
