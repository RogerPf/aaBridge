Oliver Clarke Precision (^*bOCP^*n) has |cp|red|at| ^*btwo^*n|cp||at|  main strands,  The ^*bSimple^*n  and  ^*bComplex^*n.   Chapters 1 to 17 cover the  'Simple'  System.   Chapters  18 to 22  cover the few  'Complex'  system additions. 

In making these 'movies' I have attempted to capture a little of the feel of the real-life class.  However there are always things that have to be changed for clarity.  In particular, in order to make teaching points, I have at times altered the bidding in the student sessions.  In these cases the players names have been retained for atmosphere.

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Hi Everyone and a very warm welcome (especially to all of the new faces) to the start of another series of sessions on the Precision Club bidding system. 

The course lasts about a year and all the sessions take place on Saturday evenings at 9pm GMT/UTC (which is normally 4pm EST until Daylight Savings kick in and then 5pm EDT till the end of October). 

Firstly for those of you who do not know me something by way of a quick introduction: I'm a 59 year old retired Police Sergeant now living in Scotland, but I spent most of my adult life in Manchester, England.

I've been playing Bridge since I was about 5 when my father taught me in to make up a four with him and my elder siblings. I became an instant fanatic. 

In the late 1970's and early 80's I ran a Bridge Club in Manchester (Bury Athenaeum) and taught beginner and Intermediate classes there.

I got sucked into Precision Club quite early after its introduction and have been a keen exponent of the system ever since. 

The system I will be teaching you is a Super-Precision system I developed initially with Bob Bradbury in about 1980, but in the mid 1980's I teamed up with Jason Hackett.  

He was then an England Junior and is now a full GB International and one of the UK's highest-ranked players in the WBF rankings.  

Together we developed the system a lot further and enjoyed a lot of success as a partnership and as a team with Paul Hackett and Justin Hackett. 


^*brshunta:^*n  Am I at the correct place for the precision lessons?

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  oh yes|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at| Paul Hackett was a World Grandmaster back in the 1950's and still plays for the Great Britain Senior Team. Justin and Jason are now both World International Masters have for some time been two of the highest-ranked UK players in the WBF rankings list. 

I stopped playing Face-to-Face Bridge in about 1991 when I met my wife Naomi (who doesn't play).  I now play and teach entirely online on BBO.

Today's session is more of an introduction to Precision than anything else and we'll not be getting into many specifics. 

The schedule for the sessions is detailed on my Precision website and can be seen at ^*h http://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/Program.php ^*n. 

Before we start there are a few things that need to be said. At it's simplest, Precision is a fairly "natural" system and no more difficult to learn than, for example, Standard American or Acol. 

However, a normal progression would be to have a reasonably thorough grounding in one of those systems before moving on to a system like Precision. The reason for this is that Precision is very much a D-I-Y system in that it lends itself to more complex additions.

The system I teach is NOT REMOTELY "Standard" let alone "Basic" Precision, but a somewhat simplified version of the system I developed and played in the 1970's and 1980's and is more accurately called "Super-Precision".

The system I teach includes numerous additions to and variations of Standard Precision (which you are free to ignore, of course) that give the system enormous power. This system is not for the faint-hearted, however, and it is definitely not a system for beginners.

If you have not already done so, please have a look at the notes I have prepared on Precision Club bidding. You can find these on: ^*h http://ocp.pigpen.org.uk ^*n You might want to have these onscreen in the background for reference during the session.|

nt|^b@2^z@3

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  If you happen to miss a session or to arrive late, fear not, as Roger Pfister's ^*b aaBridge ^*n program contains the whole years course.

Seeing a system in use can be a great help if you are starting to learn it.  There are over 20 of us on BBO who regularly use this system and we normally hold scheduled practices on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays at 11pm UK time (6pm EST).  

We normally meet in IAC or the Relaxed Bridge Club so please feel free to join us there. I think at the moment the practices are mainly on Thursdays. 

At the moment I'm in the middle of a series of Seminars on the "complex" version of this system for people who already know the system I teach on Saturday nights But we will try to expand those back to Wednesdays and Thursdays 

The schedule for the Practice Sessions can be found at ^*h http://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/Practices.php ^*n.  As you will see, sometimes we just practice, sometimes it's a Teams Match if numbers permit, and I do some tutorials on particular aspects of the system or cardplay.

           
|fp|t-title|at|A bit of History |fp||at|
Precision was invented by a Chinese businessman called CC Wei in the late 1960's.  It quickly gained an international reputation following its introduction onto the world stage by the Chinese National Team and was soon after adopted by the famous Italian Blue Team.  

Two members of the Blue Team (Giorgio Belladonna and Benito Garozzo) later wrote the first description of 'Super-Precision', which employed a number of Asking Bids for use in 'strong' sequences.  The system I teach is loosely based on Eric Jannerstern's description of Super-Precision, but heavily modified from that. 

Benito Garozzo is still around (over 90 now) and a frequent player on BBO (sillafu) odten playing in the regular (many times a weak) JEC matches.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Today some of the best pairs in the world use systems based on Precision including Meckstroth & Rodwell and many others and it has tended to edge out most of the other "Strong Club" systems that have appeared over the years.

So why has Precision succeeded when so many other Strong Club systems have fallen by the wayside? 

I feel the secret is that whilst Precision is fairly prescriptive in a few sequences, it remains at it's heart a very simple and consistent system that delivers the goods. The basic concepts behind it are easy enough to learn and they alone are enough to give you an edge against the likes of Acol, Standard American, 2/1, etc. 

Once you add on the "optional extras" and, best of all, the Asking Bids that turn Precision into "Super-Precision", you have a system that, for my money, most the others out of the water and, perhaps best of all, is ENORMOUS fun to play (just ask any of our Precision group). 

The trick is to take as much of the guesswork out of bidding as you can. Where so-called "Natural" systems often end up leaving you wondering whether partner has good enough trumps, or what their exact distribution is, or whether they have the Queen of Diamonds as well as the Ace.

Precision often leaves you able to write partner's exact hand down before you make the final bid of the auction knowing it's exactly the right contract. If you think that is an idle boast then to whet your appetite as to the sort of sequences precision can offer, take the following hand, which is taken from an actual tournament that Jason Hackett and I played in the 1980's:

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Ok, Let's take a look at the Opening Bids in the "Classic" version of Precision. I stress that these are NOT exactly what I teach, but I am showing you them just so that you can see where the differences lie.
This IS "Standard Precision", but it's NOT what I teach ^c@2

1@C ^d Any hand with 16+ points except 20-22 balanced (2NT).
1@D ^d 11-15, No 5-card Major, No 6-card Clubs, Not 13-15 balanced.
1@H ^d 11-15, 5-card or longer Hearts, Spades shorter than Hearts.
1@S ^d 11-15, 5-card or longer Spades, Hearts not longer.
1NT ^d 13-15 balanced or semi-balanced with a 5-card Minor.
      
2@C ^d 11-15, 6-card or longer Clubs, or 5-card Clubs with a 4-card Major.
2@D ^d 11-15, 4414 shape with a singleton Diamond.
2@H ^d 5-9 with a 6-card Heart suit.
2@S ^d 5-9 with a 6-card Spade suit.
2NT ^d 20-22 balanced.

^b@2The 1@D Opening is always a catch-all Opening showing 11-15 points and a hand unsuitable for any of the other intermediate Openings. 3 and 4-level Openings are fairly standard (ie: similar to Standard American). 

The Opening Bid most often "tinkered with" is the 2@D Opening. Most Precision pairs absorb that hand-type into the 1@D Opening and use 2@D for something else (eg: Multi, Weak 2, etc). 

Precision (and indeed most strong club systems) enjoy two huge advantages over systems such as Standard American, Acol, 2/1 etc in which the range for an Opening 1-level bid is typically 11-20 points. 

This puts pressure on responder to come up with a response in case partner is very strong. 

So playing 2/1 or Standard American and you have a grotty 5 or 6-count and your partner opens 1@S and you hold something like  @Sxx, @HKxxx, @DQxx, @CJxxx,  you are pretty much FORCED to bid something in case your partner has a monster hand.
|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


bt||
nt|^b@2^z@3|at|

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  In Precision, because the 1@D, 1@H, 1@S, 2@C and 2@D Openings are limited to a maximum of 15 points, responder is much better placed and can happily pass with a 7 or 8-count with nothing particular to say, knowing that it is extremely unlikely that a game is being missed.

Sequences such as  1x-pass-pass-pass are  far more common in Precision.  

So the hand I just outlined would be an automatic PASS opposite a Precision 1@S Opening Similarly, the 1@C Opening shows 16+ points, so Responder with a good hand themselves is in a much better position to know when the prospects of a slam are good.

When responder makes a positive response to 1@C, the whole sequence is immediately game-forcing.

So there is no need to make expensive, space-consuming bids to force to game. This allows much more space for slam-investigation. 

Over a Precision 1@C Opening, 1@D is a "Negative" Response showing 0-7 HCP.  

Bidding now continues entirely on a natural and non-forcing basis.  

Anything OTHER than 1@D is a "positive" response and Game-Forcing, showing 8+ HCP.  

In Precision you don't see many jump-shifts JUST to show strength.


The advantages I have just mentioned are ALONE enough to give Precision a big edge over other systems such as 2/1, Standard American and Acol.


Take this hand, this is playing "Standard Precision", (not my system) @-|

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Let's discuss a few general things about Precision.   Precision initially is fairly strict about point-count requirements for opening bids.

This is not to say that playing strength plays no part in deciding whether to open (or what to open) - far from it, but although Precision is a fairly aggressive system, it puts less faith in "adding" points for extra suit length than systems like Standard American or 2/1. 

Similarly, when responder is assessing their hand, it is the point-count that is initially paramount. Playing strength, trump support and ruffing values obviously play a part in assessing a hand, but the idea of adding points specifically for shortages when assessing limit bids is an alien concept to Precision. 

Indeed, limit bids in suits rather than No Trumps is not something that Precision really uses.  Direct suit raises (especially in a Major) tend to be more pre-emptive than anything else and good raises tend to follow a different route. 

Over Minor suit Openings, if Responder is interested in exploring, the general tactics are normally aimed at playing "somewhere else", for example by finding a 4-4 Major suit fit or playing in No Trumps if possible.  

That's not to say that we never play in a Minor suit game or part-score, of course.

The general features that "Classic" Precision encompasses are as follows:

|Lg|e|at|^c@2
^c@.^d1@C shows 16+ and all intermediate Openings show 11-15.
^c@.^d13-15 1NT Opening.
^c@.^dForcing 1NT Response to 1@H and 1@S Openings (Similar to 2/1)
^c@.^d2@C Opening shows 5+ Clubs and is intermediate
^c@.^d5-card Majors

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  I mentioned that the system I teach does not follow "Classic" Precision in some respects. Here are the Opening Bids in the system I teach. 

The Openings up to and including 2@C are identical to the "Classic" Precision ones.

It is from 2@D upwards that some of them differ:
|Lg|e|at|^c@2
2@D ^d 16-23  with any 4441 shape.
2@H ^d   5-9    with a 6-card @h suit (same as "Classic").
2@S ^d   5-9    with a 6-card @s suit (same as "Classic").
2NT ^d   5-9    points with at least 5-5 in Minors,     \
  " ^d 11-15  points with exactly 5-5 in Majors,       >    (2 NT is a multi)
  " ^d a "normal" 3 or 4-level pre-empt in @s's        /
  
3@C ^d 11-15 points and a 6-card @c suit with an unspecified 4-card Major
3@D ^d Normal Pre-empt    
3@H ^d     "       "
3@S ^d     "       "
3NT ^d Gambling-style (as Acol)

4@C ^d A ^*b GOOD ^*n 4-level pre-empt in  @h's
4@D ^d A ^*b GOOD ^*n 4-level pre-empt in  @s's
4@H ^d A ^*b  poor ^*n 4-level pre-empt in    @h's
4@S ^d A ^*b  poor ^*n 4-level pre-empt in    @s's

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  I mentioned the website. Besides holding details of the full system in exhaustive detail, the site also boasts a discussion forum where you can raise problems you've encountered using the system, suggest changes, or just discuss the system with others using it. 

You can register for the Forum at ^*h http://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/smf/index.php ^*n, but please use your BBO UserID and genuine Email Address to do so. 

I get a lot of spurious registrations, so I tend to delete ones I don't recognise. The website is the definitive description of the current state of the system. Any changes to the system are reflected THERE before any changes are made to the downloadable documents or the Full Disclosure Convention Cards (see below).

Those "others" using the system generally form a Team called the Precision BILlies. Besides being a competitive Team in various different combinations for different competitions, we also try to run a mentoring scheme whereby those of us who are more experienced with the system help those still learning it.

If you are seriously interested in learning and using the system, you will not be alone!!   

If you are interested, register on the Precision Site and send me an email to express an interest in the scheme and we'll try to organise things.

The activities, practices, tutorials etc are publicised on the website and if you are starting to learn the system, please let us know so that we can include you in the mentoring scheme if you want to take advantage of it. 

In addition to the scheduled practices you will often find many OCp players playing on BBO, and kibitzing them will add to your understanding of the system.

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  If you ARE serious about learning the system, it is best done as a PARTNERSHIP whereby two of you learn the system together. This is because the system demands comprehensive partnership understandings.

This is NOT a system you can start playing with a complete stranger with any degree of confidence, even if they know the system well. Our suggestion, therefore, is that you find yourself a regular partner who is also interested in learning the system. Learn together, practice and play together, and discuss the system together.

The Partnership Bidding tables on BBO, if you've not yet discovered them, are a truly wonderful asset. Jason Hackett and I would have sold our mothers for that kind of facility when we were devising and developing the system together.

Ok, I wrote the system for the most part as it stand today, much of it with Jason Hackett, but Jason and I practiced the system for 6 MONTHS before playing it in anger Much of that time was spent in discussion, of course, but it does show that it takes a fairly serious amount of commitment to learn this stuff.

One of the BIG advantages to learning this system is that there are a considerable number of people on BBO who now play this system, so there are people whom you've not partnered before with whom you will be able to sit down and play this system without a lot of discussion.

The other facility that will really help you is Full Disclosure. We have not one but 12 different Full Disclosure cards available for download from the website with different implementations of the system. These are a great learning tool in the early stages of learning the system.

If you've not encountered FD before, it is primarily a means of alerting Opps automatically about your bids, but as you can set it to show you the meaning of bids you are THINKING of making as well as bids that you and partner have already made, it is a fantastic tool when first learning the system.

Once you've learned the system you can "turn off" that feature so that only Opps see the alerts These FDCC cards range from relatively basic implementations of the system, through cards for use against other pairs playing Precision, and even versions for the full "complex" system (not the version taught in these sessions).|

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Any questions?

^*bGatorJim:^*n  Oliver, If I may add, I have been only playing the system since July.  I play every chance I get.  And it is possible to learn it fairly quickly.  If you use the standard FDCC with another OCP family partner.  Just be prepared to goof up. It will happnen.

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  True. you can grasp the essential parts of the system. There are lots of parts of the system that the FD Card CANNOT cover, though, but it will help you with the mainstream sequences. Learning the whole system so you can play it with complete confidence and no aide-memoirs takes a little longer. :)

^*bGatorJim:^*n  AND, it is a LOT of fun

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Fun I certainly can guarantee, and I'm sure others who play this system regularly (Epee9, Eszter5, Nzakosek are here, for example) will agree. LOL, Jeremy, I think "Sorry if wrong" has more to do with matters of judgment rather than the system :)

As I claimed before, this system takes a lot of guesswork out of the bidding, but it's not ALWAYS the case that you can write down partner's hand. Most of the time there is still some judgement to be made 

^*bpottsca:^*n  Miscounting steps is easier than you might think.

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  No kidding :) 
What I will say is that although, it is huge fun to play, it DOES take a great deal of concentration to play this system.

Night all, bye for now


^*bisabable:^*n tys very much o

^*bEpee9:^*n  See you all on the Forum.
