lg|c|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   The 1@d Opening is STILL not forcing in the Complex System.
 
With  0-7  points Responder will normally pass, but might bid 1@h if they have 
^o a @d shortage and a 6-card or longer Major. 
^c@2|lg|i|at|
^bThe initial responses to the Complex 1@d are completely artificial: 
1@d   -   1@h ^f            8-10 ^i hcp (any shape)            ^n|cp|gr|at|^*b This lesson^*n|cp||at|
1@d   -   1@s ^f          11-13  ^i hcp (any shape)            ^n^*g 1D:18.2, ^*bSee chapter 18.2^*n
1@d   -   1NT ^f          14+    ^i hcp (any shape)            ^n^*g 1D:18.3, ^*bSee chapter 18.3^*n  
1@d   -   2@c ^f          16+    ^i Alpha 
1@d   -   2@d ^f          16+    ^i Alpha 
1@d   -   2@h ^f          16+    ^i Alpha 
1@d   -   2@s ^f          16+    ^i Alpha
^b@2|lg||n^|7|at|
1@h and 1@s are fairly straightforward but 1NT is 14+ UNLIMITED.     

If Responder has a 16+ hand that is of a type where Alpha seems the best route then they use  2@c, 2@d, 2@h  or  2@s,  but otherwise they bid 1NT and let Opener describe their hand further. 

Needless to say the 1NT bid is invariably Game-forcing.
 
Tonight we're only going to look at the  1@d - 1@h  (8-10 hcp) sequences. 

I'll outline all of Opener's rebids and then go through each one in more detail.|

lg|c|
cp|red|at|^*bOliver:^*n|cp||at|     Hi Everyone and welcome to today's OCP session, in which we'll continue to study the full COMPLEX version of this Precision Club system.   

None of what we'll be looking at over the next few weeks has ANYTHING to do with "standard" Precision.

You absolutely CANNOT learn or play this part of the system ON YOUR OWN.

You must learn it and practice is with a regular partner who plays the REST of this System or as one of a group.   

I will ALWAYS happily play the Complex System with anyone who asks but you must be comfortable with the rest of it, including all the Asking Bids before you do so.

The Complex Sys is effectively what I used to play with Jason Hackett in the 1980's and early 90's. 

The changes affect the    1@d,   2@d,   2@h,   2@s,   3@d,   3@h,  and  3@s Openings. 

The rest of the system is identical to that which I've taught you over the last few months.

Tonight we're going to start looking at Complex 1@D responses.
|n^|5|at|

Specifically, we're going to be looking at continuations over |fp|g|at| 1@D - 1@H|fp||at|      but first an overview.

fp|t-title|at|Complex 1@D |fp||at|      ^^^^|
lg|c|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Tonight I'm going to start looking at the changes to the 1@d Responses.
 
This will take several weeks because the 1@d Responses are a system within a system that Jason and I developed over a period of several months.

The requirements for the 1@d Opening are IDENTICAL to what I've taught you at the start of the series on precision, in other words the: 

1@d Opening shows ANY 11-15 point hand that is NOT suitable for an opening of 1@h, 1@s, 1NT, 2@c, 2NT or 3@c.
^fRemember that 1NT Opening (and so in turn the 1@D Opening) are vulnerability dependent.
|lg|c|at|
So Opening 1@d denies having a  5-card Major   OR   a 6 card @c suit (unless the minor is VERY WEAK).
It denies being balanced or semi-balanced with a 5 card Minor and of a range suitable for a 1NT Opening.
It normally shows one of the following hand-types: |n#|7|lg|d|at|
^c@.      Vul        ^g11-12  balanced  OR  semi-bal  inc  5@d's  or  5@c's 
^c@.      NON-Vul    ^g13-15  balanced  OR  semi-bal  inc  5@d's  or  5@c's  
^c@.      Any   4441
^c@.      5+@d's  but  NOT semi-bal
^c@.      4@d's  ^*b&^*n  5@c's 
^c@.      Weak  6@c's
^c@.      Weak  5@c's   ^*b&^*n   4@h's or 4@s's   AND   ^*bUR^*n (upper-range)     |fp|s|at|Pass - with the lower range version of this hand|fp||at|

The ONLY change to the requirements for the 1@d Opening in the Complex System 
^n  are that it DENIES having      6@d's   ^*b&^*n   4@h's or 4@s's.
|n^|7|at|
This is because of what the 2@h and 2@s Openings show in the Complex System, (guess LOL). |

fp|t-title|at|The Complex 1@d System is  OFF  after a PASS |fp||at|      ^^^^|
lg|c|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   If you want to play 2@h and 2@s as Lucas Two's, Tartan Two's or anything like that, it doesn't take too much work to absorb the 4-6 11-15 openings back into 1@d.
|n^|7|at|
Personally I prefer the Reverse Roman Openings, so that is what I will actually teach you.
|n^|7|at|
Before we go on I need to explain and stress one thing (because it's easily forgotten). 


|fp|t-title|at|The Complex 1@d System is  OFF  after a PASS |fp||n#|5|at|
If Responder is a PASSED hand then the Complex 1@d System simply does NOT apply and all bidding over the 1@d Opening is STRICTLY NATURAL along identical lines to the "normal" system (with the one excep tion that the 2@c and 2@d bids are no longer forcing to 2NT).

So the  Complex 1@d System ONLY applies in 1st or 2nd position.

If you're a passed hand, you're assumed to be  0-10  and so there's no point playing a system where the initial responses to 1@D are  hcp based.

|n^|7|at|
1@d - 1@h   -      2@d ^g         5+@D's   (if a 4 card Major also held, they will be ^*bLR^*n)
1@d - 1@h   -      2@h ^g         ^*bUR^*n  with  4@H's and 5@D's 
1@d - 1@h   -      2@s ^g         ^*bUR^*n  with  4@S's and 5@D's 
1@d - 1@h   -      2NT ^g         MAXIMUM  with 6 or 7@D's and normally 'semi'-balanced  (6322 or 7222)  so
|n^|3|at|                                          ^p    with scattered values outside the @D's
1@d - 1@h   -      3@c ^g         MAXIMUM with at least   5@d's  ^*b&^*n  5@c's 
1@d - 1@h   -      3@d ^g         ^*bUR^*n UNBALANCED  with 6+@D's
|lg|c|n#|7|at|
^bOpener's rebids are ^*b constrained ^*n (strictly defined).
|n^|7|at|
For example You'll notice that with 1@d - 1@h - 2@c   and when Opener has 4 in a Major and weak 5@C's they must be ^*bUR^*n (upper-range).
This is because our suggestion is always that you don't open and instead PASS when holding a ^*bLR^*n hand of this type (ie: where the @C's are not good enough for a 2@c Opening).|

lg|c|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   You'll notice that all of the bids from 2@h upwards show ^*bUR^*n or maximum hands.

That is because after  1@d - 1@h  the emphasis is almost always on reaching the most sensible part-score at the cheapest level,  we're only ever going to be heading towards game if BOTH of us are maximum.


The  1@d - 1@s  sequences (covered next week) tend to be the most complex, because now we're in invitational territory as a matter of course.


We will come  to   1@d - 1@h - 1@s    in a moment but first I want to cover ...



|fp|t-title|at|1@d  -  1@h  -  1NT |fp||n#|5|at|
Because the  1@d - 1@h  pair of bids do not show ^*b ANY ^*n suits, we treat the 1NT rebid EXACTLY like an opening 1NT, so ALL of the normal continuations such as:  Stayman,  2 Way-2@D,  4 way transfers   etc   apply.



Let's have a couple of quick examples.|

fp|t-title|at|Complex  1@D  -  1@h   Sequences|fp||at|      ^^^^|
lg|c|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Let's look as those Opener's rebids over  1@d - 1@h  in a more detail.
|n^|7|at|
^c1@d   -   1@h   -   1@s ^h shows ANY ^*b 4441 ^*n shape hand.    Responder always responds 1NT  and Opener now
|n^|7|at|
bids the suit BELOW the singleton.    With a MAXIMUM Responder can now make a RANGE BETA Ask (extra '^*bLR^*n' step in front of normal scale) in the singleton suit and will then bid the final contract. 
|n^|5|at|
If instead Responder simply signs off in a suit, Opener can now invite with a MAXIMUM, but the general rule is that UNLESS Responder makes that Range Beta to show a maximum 10, Opener will not normally invite even with a MAX.
 
As I said before,  generally after  1@d - 1@h,  we need BOTH of us to be max to get to game.

^c1@d   -   1@h   -   1NT ^h @2shows a balanced or semi-balanced (5 card @c's or @d's) hand of a range unsuitable for an opening 1NT bid (ie: 13-15 when NOT Vul   and   11-12 when Vul). 
^b@2|n^|5|at|
Continuations are EXACTLY as over an Opening of 1NT (eg: Stayman, 4-way Transfers, 2-way 2@d, INTRO, Transfer Leb etc).    The only exception is immediate jump shifts to the 3 level which are merely invitational with a good 6 card or longer suit.    So no Alpha over  1@d - 1@h - 1NT,  for obvious reasons.
|n^|5|at|
You and partner decide what the difference is between 
^d 1@d  -  1@h  -  1NT  -  3@h                                 and 
^d 1@d  -  1@h  -  1NT  -  2@d  -  2@h  -  3@h 
as both show invitational hands with a 6 card Heart suit. 
|n^|5|at|
Personally I tend to reserve the direct 3@h for occasions where I have something I feel might need protecting and I also tend to play the transfer sequence as strongly invitational and the direct 3@h as mildly invitational.
 
You can work out your own preference with your partner.    

Any questions so far?|

|n^|8|at| 
If ^*bUR^*n they will NOT have a    5@c's  ^*b & ^*n  (4@h's or 4@s's)   suit as well.
 
Because of the 2@h and 2@s reverse Roman Openings, they ^^ ^p will NOT have a      6@d's  ^*b & ^*n  (4@h's or 4@s's).
|n^|8|at|

at|^^The 3NT bid is not a bad bid but because North cannot be sure South has any @s's.  Eg: a @c lead to West's (possible) Ace and a @s back could mean 4 spade losers.   I think a better sequence would be
|n^|8|at|  
     2NT(enquiry)   -   3@s(Singleton @c, @s = suit below shortage)   -   3NT(with confidence)|

at|     One thing East needs to be aware of is that the only time West will have a 4-card major is when they (West) are also Maximum (15)  and that is going to be rare.

So East can bid 3@C knowing that if West is MAX and has a 4 card major he will make a move.|

at|2NT bid here pretty much has to be a max (10).  3@c probably gets you to 3NT as well.  East can tell West must have their points in the majors.  
|n#|3|at|
If INSTEAD West bids 2@h over 2@d  East will bid 3@c the problem then will be that West does not have the info that East is maxium and so might pass the 3@c.

Please remember that you really need to learn and practice this with a PARTNER.
