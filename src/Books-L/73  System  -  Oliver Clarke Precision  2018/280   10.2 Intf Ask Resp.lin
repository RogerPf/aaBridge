By pre-emptive, I mean where the interference jumps at least 1 round of bidding and is at or above the level of 3NT.

The scheme is similar to the earlier one, but significantly different:
^c@2
Any direct BID ^g by the Asker is STILL carrying on the Asking Bid sequence
 
DOUBLE  ^g is still an Ask in the suit below that of the interference
 
PASS ^g is now ^*b Lebensohl-style ^*n forcing partner to ^*b DOUBLE ^*n|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Hi Everyone and welcome to today's Precision Club session, in which we'll be continuing our look at what to do when opponents interfere during our Asking Bid Sequence.

Tonight we'll be looking at the Asker's action when Opps intervene over the response to a previous Asking Bid.

Our approach here is significantly different to those we considered last week, since we're trying to give the Asker access to the Asks that Opps' interference has bypassed (and which will now be quite "expensive" asks) rather than recouping space as such.

This whole topic really falls into a number of sections and we'll take each one in turn:|

fp|t-title|at|Re-cap  of  Last  Week's  Class|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Last week we looked at what to do if opponents intervened directly over the 1@C Opening.

There, any BID by responder shows a positive response.   With a negative (fewer than 8 points):

Responder:  with   0-4   Passes,      with  5-7  Doubles (or Redoubles)    ie: a sort of DIPO & RIPO

Secondly, last week, we looked at what to do when opponents interfere immediately over an Ask.

Here we use DOPI & ROPI (or more accurately, D1P2 and R1P2)  to conserve space over the interference,  so
 
^c Double = 1 step,     Pass = 2 steps,     1 step = a normal 3-step response,   etc.

When the interference is more pre-emptive we actually simplify and shorten the ranges for each Asking Bid except Beta and Zeta.

Before we move on, does anyone have any queries or uncertainties regarding what we covered last week?

fine OK.


As I said before, this week we'll be having a look at the following:-

fp|t-title|cp|h-highlight|at|^*b[C.1]^*n|cp||at|     Intervention  over  the  RESPONSE  to  an  Asking  Bid|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Please note that this is NOT exactly the same thing as our actions by Opener after interference immediately over a positive response to 1@C.

It is similar, but there are critical differences.   Firstly, we're going to look at what action OPENER (or perhaps we should more accurately say the "Asker") should take if our opponents intervene immediately over the RESPONSE to a previous Asking Bid.

The general rule here is very similar to DOPI & ROPI, except that we're now working BACKWARDS, to ask in the suits immediately below that of the interference.

Those asks have now become comparatively quite "expensive", so asking "backwards" gives us easy and cheap access to them.

To clarify: ^*b DOUBLE ^*n / ^*b REDOUBLE^*n  is an Asking Bid in the suit immediately BELOW that of the interference, 

^c(or the suit immediately below the last suit bid by anyone if we've had some doubles or redoubles).

And ^*b PASS ^*n is an Asking Bid in the suit below that (ie: 2 suits below).


So if the sequence starts: 

^c 1@C   -   1@H   -   1@S(Alpha)    -    1NT(No sup, 0-3 ctrls)   -   (2@S[Michaels])    -    ??? 

Now Opener can  ^f DOUBLE  ^i to ask about  partners  Hearts
                ^f PASS    ^i to ask about  Diamonds 
                ^f bid 3@C ^i to ask about  Clubs       etc
|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|cp|h-highlight|at|^*b[C.1]^*n|cp||at|     Intervention  over  the  RESPONSE  to  an  Asking  Bid|fp||at|     continued^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  To repeat:       ^*b PASS ^*n is an Asking Bid in the suit below that (ie: 2 suits below)

When calculating the  "suit below"  and the  "suit 2 below",   ^*bwe ignore No Trumps^*n, 

^d EXCEPT where 1NT WOULD HAVE BEEN a low-level Beta.

So the suit   ^*bbelow^*n   Clubs  is  Spades,      and the suit   ^*b2 below^*n   Clubs is  Hearts.

Needless to day if partner's response to the previous Ask was a  D1P2 Pass  or  R1P2 Pass,  over interference by your LHO  then only the  Double / Redouble  is available as an Ask.

And if partner has made a  D1P2 Double  or  R1P2 Redouble  after interference by your LHO over your previous Ask, then a  PASS  is now simply a PENALTY pass, since there is no guarantee that partner will get another chance to bid.

So Opener can decide to pass a  D1P2 or R1P2 Double  or  Redouble by partner (or even a pass by them, for that matter), 

but if Opener  Doubles, redoubles or passes  in circumstances where that is an Asking Bid  then Responder ^*b does NOT have that option ^*n  they cannot pass.    Hence: 

^c 1@C   -    1@H   -    1NT(Beta)   -    2@D(3 ctrls)   -    (2@S)   -    ???       Now

DOUBLE ^d   would be an Asking Bid (Gamma) in Hearts    (suit 1 below),  
PASS ^d   would be an Asking Bid (Theta) in Diamonds  (suit 2 below).

2NT here would be a quite normal "Handing over the Captaincy".

It's easy to see that here we would be able to make a Theta Ask in Diamonds more cheaply than would have been the case without the interference.|

fp|t-title|cp|h-highlight|at|^*b[C.1]^*n|cp||at|     Intervention  over  the  RESPONSE  to  an  Asking  Bid|fp||at|     continued^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Please just note (at this stage) that it's DIFFERENT immediately over a positive response to 1@C, 

in which case PASS is ALWAYS Gamma in Partner's suit, if they've shown one.   We'll come to that next week.

Another example: 

^c 1@C    -    1NT(@s's)    -    2@C(Beta)   -    2NT(5 ctrls)   -    (3@C)   -    ???       Now 

DOUBLE ^e is Gamma in Spades, the suit  1  "below" Clubs
PASS ^e is Theta     in Hearts,   the suit  2  "below" Clubs.


And another: 

^c 1@C    -    1@H(pos)    -    1NT(Beta)   -    2@C(0-2 ctrls)   -    (2@D)   -    ???       Now 

DOUBLE  ^e over  2@D is  Theta in Clubs, and 
PASS ^e is ONCE AGAIN Beta, but now using the WEAK scale (because 1NT was, and still would be, Beta).


Is everyone following this so far ?

Anyone having a problem ? 

Let's see an example hand.|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   On the other hand, at this vulnerability, it's unlikely South has much in Spades,

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   In the last hand, we saw the two facets of our auction over interference, both as Responder and Asker.
^^To really drive the point home, see if you can follow what's happening here:

^c 1@C   -    (^*bX^*n)   -    1@D(5+ Diamonds, 8+ hcp)   -    (^*bX^*n)   -    ^*bXX^*n(Alpha in Clubs) 
 
Over the first double, negative responses are catered for with Pass and Redouble, so 1@D becomes a positive response in Diamonds.

Over the second double, redouble is an Ask in the suit below the last suit bid (Diamonds) and therefore Alpha in Clubs.

Before we leave that last example it's a one off special exception to the rule about ignoring No Trumps in these situations: 

^c 1@C   -    (^*bX^*n)   -    1@D(5+ Diamonds, 8+ hcp)   -    (^*bX^*n)   -    Pass(^*bBeta^*n)

The  PASS  is  ^*bBeta^*n.  This is because  1@H  and  1@S  are available for Alpha in those suits so cheaply, and so we count back to (zero)NT, as it were.   

So far as I'm aware,  that situation has never arisen in anger,  but it's worth bearing in mind.   :)|

fp|t-title|cp|h-highlight|at|^*b[C.1]^*n|cp||at|     Intervention  over  the  RESPONSE  to  an  Asking  Bid|fp||at|     continued^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   One last example to clarify the issue with No Trumps: 

^c 1@C   -    1@S   -    (2@C)   -    ^*bX^*n(Beta)   -    2@D(0-2 ctrls)   -    (^*bX^*n)   -    Pass 

So here the double (^*bX^*n over 2@C) is  ^*bBeta^*n,  this is because 1NT (1 'suit' below 2@c)  would have been   ^*bBeta^*n.

Over the double of  2@D,  Pass is an Ask in the "suit 2 below" (1NT is the 'suit' 2 below 2@d), 

and because responders exact controls haven't been established (therefore Beta is still needed), the low-level Beta is STILL available,

so the PASS is a second low-level Beta (similar to the example I gave before).

Everyone follow?
^^
Hence the rule is that if  ^*b1NT^*n  is either the suit below, or the "suit" 2 below  ^*bAND^*n  that would have been Beta then

it ^*b IS ^*n included in the scheme, but otherwise  No Trumps are ignored  in counting the "suit below" and the "suit 2 below".

We do NOT "count backwards" to bids of  2@C,  2@D  and  2@H  that would have been Low Beta (ie: a relay over Responder's Positive), but ONLY to Low Beta's of  ^*b1NT^*n  that have been bypassed.

It's very easy to see that CHEAP interference, especially doubles and redoubles, almost always ends up gaining us space, sometimes whole rounds of bidding.

This method is a VERY VERY powerful weapon, but it does take a fair amount of concentration.

At the very least we minimize the space denied to us by the interference.|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   When the PREVIOUS ask was a trump Asking Bid  ^*bAND^*n  partner has shown a Positive response 
^^ ^c(ie: 4-step Theta/Delta,     3-step Alpha/Iota     and     ANY response to  Eta/Gamma/Zeta) 
^^^*bthen^*n  the  standard ^*bRelay Beta^*n  is available to you.    But should your RHO bid, this changes, and 

^c PASS         (the cheapest option available)  becomes the  ^*bRelay Beta^*n  and
^c DOUBLE    is an ask in the  1 suit below.

The only exception to this is when the interference by Opps is pre-emptive (ie: jumping a level to a level above 3NT or game in our agreed suit).

As we'll see in a minute in these circumstances 

^c PASS         is  |cp|h-highlight|at|^*bLebensohl ^*n|cp||at|  (asking partner to Double)
^c DOUBLE    is the  ^*bRelay Beta^*n.


Before we look at that, any questions on what we've covered so far? 


I'm teaching a gang of zombies tonight  LOL  :)

^*bisabable:^*n   lol


Time for another example.|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|    So just looking at the position over the 2@D response.   The positive response there wasn't "disturbed"
^d    so  Relay Beta  remains available. 

But suppose instead South had bid 2@S and West responded 3@D, now it WOULD be a disturbed response, and no "Relay Beta" would have been available.

So East would have to use  3@S Alpha  and follow it up with a  Relay Beta.       Any questions or comments?|

fp|t-title|cp|h-highlight|at|^*b[C.2]^*n|cp||at|     Pre-emptive  Intervention  over  the  RESPONSE  to  an  Asking  Bid|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Now we look at Openers actions after Pre-emptive Intervention over the RESPONSE to  an Asking Bid.

By pre-emptive, I mean where the interference jumps at least 1 round of bidding and is at or above the level of 3NT.


The scheme is similar to the earlier one, but significantly different:
^c@2
Any direct BID ^g by the Asker is STILL carrying on the Asking Bid sequence
 
DOUBLE  ^g is still an Ask in the suit below that of the interference
 
PASS ^g is @2now ^*b Lebensohl ^*n forcing responder to ^*b DOUBLE ^*n

asker (Opener) will now either  PASS  for penalties, or make a sign-off bid.
^b@2
^^
So if you just want to sign off somewhere, 

^d you ^*b must ^*n  to go through the ^*b PASS - DOUBLE  Lebensohl ^*n sequence FIRST, 

^e because any immediate BID by the Asker is potentially still an Asking Bid.
^^
Similarly  DOUBLE  by the Asker is NOT for penalties, but an Ask in the suit below.|

fp|t-title|cp|h-highlight|at|^*b[C.2]^*n|cp||at|     Pre-emptive  Intervention  over  the  RESPONSE  to  an  Asking  Bid|fp||at|       cont.^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   If the Asker wants to take a penalty, they have to go through the Pass-Double Lebensohl sequence

and then PASS the double for penalties.     An example: 

^c 1@C    -     1NT    -     2@C(Beta)    -     2@D(0-2 ctrls)    -     (4@H)    -     ???? 
^^
The  4@H  bid has jumped at least 1 round of bidding and is above 3NT, so now...
^c@2
DOUBLE   ^e   is Alpha in Diamonds

^c@2PASS ^e   is Lebensohl, telling partner to Double   and    if Opener then bids 4@S then that is a sign-off. 

4@S ^e   direct by Opener is  Gamma  in Spades, ^*b NOT ^*n a  sign-off  in Spades.
^b@2
Hopefully, you can see that at the expense of losing the  "suit 2 below ask",  we have a flexible system where Opener can choose to;   continue the Asking Bids,  Sign-off    OR    take a penalty.

The "sign-off" part has to be used with a bit of common sense, particularly if responder's exact level of controls is not known.   So if responder has a particularly suitable hand or more controls than partner might expect then he has the right to continue by cue-bidding.

^c1@C   -    1@H   -    1@S(Alpha)   -    2@D(4+ ctrls, No Sup)   -    (4@C)   -    Pass(Leb)   -    X   -    4@S   -    ??? 

If Responder has something like  Qx or xxx  in Spades and, say, 5 controls and a void in Clubs, then they would be crazy not to continue by cue-bidding Clubs.|

fp|t-title|at|Practice / Demo  Hands|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   I mentioned last week that we have been considering CHANGING the level at which this kind of action
^d (ie: Pass = Lebensohl) kicks in.

It has been suggested that we should possibly bring this into use ANY time that we've not yet agreed trumps and Opps make any kind of pre-emptive interference (ie: jumping at least a round of bidding).

No decision has been made on this as yet, but the notes on the website will change if we do decide on a change.


Any questions on actions over pre-emptive interference?
 

Ok then 4 volunteers please

ht|d|at|^^|
cp||at|^*bMM:^*n|cp||at|  We all know we have to alert when playing  'proper'  bridge.

The laws of the game say that what we have to put in the alert is  ^*b our agreement with partner ^*n about that bid.

While creating these bridge movies, I have gone through and added to, or amended, many of the alerts that were in the original text.

I have changed them from being ^*b REAL ^*n alerts, that you should give to real opponents, and have replaced them with ^*b STUDY ^*n alerts.   Study alerts are only useful to students of Oliver's Precision.  Of course in many cases no changes were needed.   For example    1@c     16+ Any dist except 16-23 4441

It is particularly important that we make the alerts for  ^*b Asking bids and their responses^*n,  as clear as possible

	    ^c ^*b Study Alert ^*n           ^i ^*b Real Alert ^*n                ^o ^*b It would be great if you could add ^*n
     ^b      @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@- ^h       @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-   ^n       @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-
		^c Beta    Relay Beta ...          ^i Gen Ctrl Ask                    ^o A = 2,  K = 1 
		^c Alpha                           ^i Asking  in                      ^o Trump ...
		^c Gamma                           ^i Asking  in partners suit        ^o Trump ...
		^c Epsilon                         ^i Specific Ctrl Ask               ^o in ... 
		^c Hxx                             ^i Hxx                             ^o in ... 
		^c none  or  1st & 2nd             ^i none  or  1st & 2nd             ^o [xxx, AKx(x)]
		^c 3rd rd ctrl                     ^i 3rd rd ctrl                     ^o [xx, Qxx(x), Qx]
		
An easy mistake in reply to an Epsilon is when, say, you hold ^*b Q76 ^*n in the suit, and so give only ^*b Qxx ^*n in the alert.   THAT  IS  WRONG.  The agreement is ^*b 3rd round control ^*n and that is what should be told to the opps.   

The ^*b ethical ^*n problem with telling too much to your opps is that it disadvantages the other pairs who will play your opponents cards.|
