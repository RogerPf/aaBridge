cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at| Hi Everyone and welcome to today's Precision Club session, in which we'll be taking a look at defending against Precision.

We'll be having a look at general tactics and I'll also go over a few conventional defences against 1@c Openings that you might like to consider.

First one piece of news,  John (lute57), who kindly stood in for me for the last couple of lessons is writing a three volume book about this system which will hopefully be completed by this time next year.

So Watch this space!!!! 


If you have not already done so, please have a look at the notes I have prepared on Precision Club bidding.

You can find these on:  ^*h http://ocp.pigpen.org.uk ^*n

The Defences I'll be covering today can be found at  ^*h http://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/Defences.php  ^*n

Before we start, are there any questions that anyone has on our methods of coping with interference during Asking Bid sequences (ie: what we have been covering the past 3 or 4 sessions)? 

OK, plenty to cover tonight, so let's crack on...|

fp|t-title|at|Defending  Against  Precision|fp||at|^^^^|
lg|b|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Defending against Precision requires a bit of thought and discussion with your partner, not least because some of the bids your opponents are making are not natural (eg: 1@c and 1@d Openers).

Similarly, some of the other opening do NOT mean what you might expect them to mean against other pairs key examples of this are the  2@c, 2@d  bids.

|n#|8|fp|t-title|at|Defending  Against  the  1@D  Opening|fp||n#|9|at|
Taking the  1@d  Opening first,  you have to think about the possible hand types that the  1@d  Opening shows.
|n#|8|at|The main issue here is that 1@d Openers are very often weighted towards the minor suits (but not always).
|n#|8|at|The  1@d  Opening can also be balanced (4432 or 4333 with the wrong range for 1NT), 4441 shape, or single-suited with a long Minor.  I tend to ^*b double immediately ^*n with both majors (at least 5-4) but with hands less suitable it very often works to pass the first time around and come in on the second round of bidding, once you have a clearer idea of opener's shape.

Bear in mind that in Precision  a  1@d  Opening does ^*b NOT ^*n promise a Diamond suit.

It can be as few as a 2-card Diamond holding and my system routinely opens 1@d with 4414 shape and a singleton @d.
In theory my system could possibly open 1@d with a Diamond void   (eg: @sAK5  @hAK4  @d-  @c9865432)

If you have diamonds, I would ALWAYS pass on the first round of bidding and come in later, as it is not very likely that the 1@d Opening will be passed out.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Defending  Against  the  1@d  Opening|fp||at|      continued^^^^|
lg|b|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  The sequence     (1@d)   -   2D    is usually going to be a 2-suited overcall of some kind (eg: Michaels), so PASSING over  1@d  and then bidding Diamonds on the ^*b NEXT ^*n round will always be showing Diamonds.

I do not advocate a complex conventional defence to the Precision  1@d  Opening under any circumstances.

...if only because of the wide variety of hand types that can be opened with 1@d However...

Essentially you can treat the 1@d Opening as if it was natural and keep Double for takeout, 2@d as Michaels, normal overcalls etc.

To repeat, with Diamonds, just pass on the first round and then come in with Diamonds on the SECOND round of bidding.

Any questions on defending against a Precision 1@d? 

look at this hand.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Defending  Against  the  2@D  Opening|fp||at|^^^^|
lg|b|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  The "Classic"  Precision system uses  2@d  to show  11-15 hcp  and  4414  shape (singleton @d)  so  defending against it is relatively easy, since the shape of Opener's hand is an open book.

It is quite rare that I ever intervene against a 2@d Opener unless I have diamonds, since you know that any other suit is going to split badly for you even if you find a fit.

On the other hand, knowing which defender will have 4-card trumps is a big advantage, so don't be deterred from it if your hand is likely to be able to cope with that kind of situation  (eg: a solid trump suit like KQJ10xx).

Again, I would suggest that a conventional defence against the Precision  2@d  Opener is not worthwhile and natural methods will usually be completely sufficient.

My own Precision system doesn't use 2@d as showing  11-15  and  4414  shape Instead it shows ^*b ANY ^*n 4441  shape hand in the ^*n 16-23 ^*n range.  If you are defending against the 2@d Opener WE use then I would be very wary of entering the bidding when there is a 16-23 point hand floating about UNTIL you know where their shortage is, since every other suit WILL be breaking badly for you.

9 times out of 10 Opener ends up showing their exact shape by bidding the suit below and THEN you can decide whether to come in or not.  EG:

^c2@d   -   2@h(Relay)     -   2@s(16-19)   -   2NT(Relay)   -   3@d(@h Singleton)   -   ...

At this point you can decide whether it's worth intervening or not.  Needless to say I would probably NOT enter the bidding except to double for PENALTIES once Opps have decided where to play, or to suggest a contract in Opener's short suit.    I would not play a Double as being for takeout here, for the reason listed above.    
 
Bear in mind that there is no way ANYONE is going to play in anything below the 3-level here.|

fp|t-title|at|Defending  Against  the  2@C  Opening|fp||at|^^^^|
lg|b|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  The Precision 2@c Opening always shows AT LEAST a 5-card Club suit in the 11-15 hcp range Defending against the Precision 2@c Opener is relatively simple and can be left to natural methods.

Since Opener is known to have at least 5-card Clubs normal methods will work as with a natural system.

So just defend as you would over a "normal" 1@c Opening, (but just one level higher).

One thing I really must recommend to you is the use of Lebensohl (or better still Transfer Lebensohl) when opponents have opened and partner has made a take-out double.

Use of Lebensohl is quite common after takeout doubles over weak 2 Openings, but it can also be very effective after takeout doubles at the 1 level or over a Precision  2@c  Opening.

Lebensohl gives you so much more scope to show different ranges of strength and different types of hand, that it really does gives your competitive bidding a whole new dimension.

We will be specifically covering Lebensohl in competitive sequences later on during this course.

If you want to have a look at it, then it is covered in the notes on the website ^*h http://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/ ^*n.

I really am a huge fan of Lebensohl, especially Transfer Lebensohl, and I can't recommend it to you more highly, whatever system you're playing.

In my view it's one of the most useful bidding concepts ever devised.

Ok, let's get to the main part of this session: |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


--------------------------------------------------------------------
bt||
nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Defending  Against  the  1@C  Opening|fp||at|^^^^|
lg|b|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Now we move onto the main section of this teaching session, which is defending against the Precision 1@c Opener.

Because this is a wholely artificial Opening and always shows a strong hand, we want to disrupt opponent's auction wherever possible.

This does not mean, however, that we have to be foolhardy to the point of insanity.

So always have an eye to the vulnerability.

For example, at Red against White it is rare that you will have a hand-type that will allow you to compete effectively and if you do, it will more often than not be a long solid or semi-solid suit.

With weak hands, therefore, the answer is to use up as much of the opponents' bidding space as possible.

Don't pussyfoot around with simple overcalls, but use up 2 or 3 rounds of their bidding space IF you have a hand that has some playing strength.

Making a pre-emptive 2-suited overcall on a ^*b weak ^*n 4432 shape hand is just not worthwhile, in my view.

If you have a decent hand, however, then by all means go more slowly to give you and your partner more room.

Just because one of the opps have opened 1@c, that doesn't mean that the hand belongs to them, or that you have no chance for a game.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


--------------------------------------------------------------------
bt||
nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Defending  Against  the  1@C  Opening|fp||at|      continued ^^^^|
lg|b|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  However, in many instances the best tactic if you have a good hand is to keep silent and then come in later if it looks like the bidding is about to die at a low level.

Tipping off your opps to how the suits are lying when you have little or no hope of competing effectively is not something I would advocate.

The other time when simple overcalls can be effective is when they are simply lead   -   directing.

A holding like ^*b KQJ10x^*n,  for example, can be shown cheaply with little risk to the bidder, especially when sat underneath the  1@c  bidder (who is more likely to be the declarer in a NT contract, so partner would be on lead).

If, on the other hand, you are sat OVER the 1@c bidder, then there's more temptation to keep quiet, especially if it looks like opps will end up in No Trumps with Opener being the declarer, otherwise you might just talk them out of a contract that you can defeat.

So the bottom line is to interfere as pre-emptively as possible when you have the hand for it, go more slowly when you have a decent hand yourself, and keep quiet if the vulnerability is wrong, or you don't really have a hand with which to compete or safely disrupt their auction 


Any questions thus far?  ok |

lg|b|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  The last bit of CRO-Panama (this is the Panama bit)   is  |cp|red|at|^*b jump overcalls ^*n|cp||n#|8|at|
^c^*bJump Overcalls ^*n|cp||at|  show   EITHER|n#|5|at|
^e a   ^*b weak  jump-overcall ^*n in bid suit 
^c    OR
^e a   ^*b 3-suited ^*n hand with a ^*b shortage ^*n in the bid suit

Thus     (1@c)   -   2@s    shows either  Spades   ^*b OR ^*n   a 3-suited hand with  Hearts,  Diamonds  and  Clubs.

Responder (and opps) are expected to work out which of those two possibilities you have.  So, to repeat the above sequence,   (1@c)   -   2@s   is ^*b either ^*n 6+ Spades  ^*b OR ^*n  a Spade shortage.

Panama might sound like a dodgy proposition, but responder can normally tell which sort of hand you have.

It's certainly good fun when you have the 3-suited hand.  :)

Responder normally assumes the WJO (Weak Jump Overcall), and it is normally the  Panama  bidder who moves
but ^*b only    IF ^*n doubled   ^*bAND      IF ^*n she has the 3-suiter.

Panama can have a very significant effect on unprepared opponents who have not discussed what to do over this kind of defence.

When you have the three-suited hand, opps who do not have an agreed method for exposing it can run into trouble, because (the opps) bids of your singleton suit may get treated (by them) as cue-bids rather than natural bids.

^*byleexotee: ^*n  What is partner's response, is there a relay of some sort ? 

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Good question, I'll get to that soon.|

lg|b|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  So the rule with Panama, is that partner assumes you have the weak jump overcall in that suit and generally passes, unless they want to compete further with a 2-suited hand that includes that suit and at least one of the others.

|n^|4|at|If the Panama bid is doubled for penalties, then the Panama bidder will redouble with a shortage in that suit and partner can now take their pick.

|n^|4|at|If they have a 6-card holding in that suit, then, of course, they'll simply pass. So no relays, or anything like that.
 
|n^|4|at|Treat it as a WJO, and only move ^*b IF ^*n it is doubled for penalties ^*b AND ^*n  partner redoubles  eg:

|n^|4|at|^c(1@c)                  -   2@s[@s or not @s]          -      (Pass[< 8 hcp])     -      Pass
^c(X[Penalties])     -            XX                     -      (Pass)                   -       ???

|n^|4|at|Now you should give preference to (and bid) one of the other suits.     ^t Similarly 

^c(1@c)                      -    2@s[@s or not @s]      -       (X[8+ hcp])        -       Pass 
^c(Pass[Penalties])   -         XX                     -         (Pass)             -         ???

In both of these sequences, the redouble is showing a @s shortage and the other 3 suits.

|n^|4|at|I've seen people making these kind of Panama overcalls on very weak 4432 hands, bidding their doubleton.

|n^|8|at|^*b^fI do not recommend it LOL :)  ^*n 

|n^|4|at|Keep it for WJO's or 4441 or 4450 hands, or occasionally 3451 shape hands.

|n^|4|at|Like I said, CRO-Panama can cause absolute havoc against Opps who are not prepared for it, especially when you have the 3-suited hand.

lg|b|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Another simpler defence to Precision you might like to consider is Truscott, which is a bit safer if less fun.

|n^|6|at|You might like to consider playing Truscott at unfavourable vulnerability and CRO-Panama at level or favourable.

|n#|4|fp|t-title|at|Truscott|fp||n^|6|at|

^c^*b Simple Overcall ^*n  ^h shows     ^*b 2-suited hands ^*n   with   ^*bthat suit  ^*n and ^*b  the suit above.^*n

^e For example     (1@c)   -   1@h     shows the Majors, and      (1@c)   -   1@s   shows the black suits.

^c^*b Jump Overcall ^*n    ^h shows     ^*b a Weak Jump Overcall ^*n  in  ^*b that suit.^*n

^e So Jump overcalls are natural.  Again,  Lebensohl-style  responses can be very useful here.

^c^*b Double  ^*n          ^h shows     ^*b Clubs ^*n and ^*b Hearts ^*n

^c^*b 1NT  ^*n             ^h shows     ^*b Diamonds ^*n and ^*b Spades ^*n

So Double through to 2@c all show 2-suited hands, and 2@d upwards are WJO's.

|n^|6|at|Truscott works on the assumption that, when you don't have that one LONG suit suitable for a WJO, it is safer to intervene if you can give partner a choice of 2 suits.

|n^|6|at|But it doesn't really cope with hands where you want to make a simple overcall with a decent hand, or want just to make a lead-directing overcall.

Any questions on Truscott    ok|

lg|b|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  I'm going to mention relatively briefly a further 4 defences to 1@c you might consider There are literally hundreds of defences to Strong Club Openings, however.

Other popular ones are:     Mathe,    Suction (Many varieties of this),    Crash    and     Amsbury.

|n#|4|fp|t-title|at|Mathe|fp||n^|6|at|

^c ^*b Double ^*n ^e shows   ^*b both Majors ^*n|n#|2|at|
^c ^*b 1NT    ^*n ^e shows   ^*b both Minors ^*n|n#|4|at|
^c ^c  Everything else is natural 

If you don't want to push the boat out too far then this may be the one for you! LOL.

Mathe is surprisingly popular, perhaps because it's simple and relatively foolproof.   It's a bit TOO simple for my taste.     AS you can probally guess, I am not a huge fan of Mathe.  :)

For me the main purpose in interfering in a strong club auction is to CONSUME Opps' bidding space, so I tend to restrict my interference to those times when I feel I have the opportunity to do that and a sufficiently distributional hand that the chances of finding a playable fit with partner are good.

If I can't do that safely, I tend to keep quiet.|

fp|t-title|at|Defending  Against  the  1@C  Opening    -    Suction|fp||at|^^^^|
lg|b|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Suction is a fairly simple idea but there are many different ways of playing it.

|n#|4|fp|t-title|at|Suction|fp||n^|6|at|

^b    ^*bOvercalls ^*n  show  ^*b either ^*n  the ^*b suit ABOVE ^*n the  ^*bsuit bid^*n     ^*b OR ^*n    the ^*b other 2 suits ^*n (^*bnot ^*n the suit bid)   So

^c(1@c)   -   1@h    shows either a single-suited hand with  Spades    ^*b OR ^*n  a 2-suited hand with both Minors.   And

^c(1@c)   -   2@c    shows either a single-suited hand with Diamonds ^*b OR ^*n  a 2-suited hand both with Majors.

Partner assumes the single-suited hand and normally bids that suit, and you then "correct" to the cheaper of your two suits if you have the 2-suited hand.  So:

^c(1@c)   -   1@h[@s or @d+@c]   -   (pass[0-4])    -   1@s   -   (pass)  -   2@c     would show  both Minors.

^c(1@c)   -   2@c[@d or @h+@s]   -   (pass[0-4])    -   2@d   -   (pass)  -   2@h     would show  both Majors.

^b    ^*b1NT ^*n  shows  a  2-suiter with two non-touching suits  (@c+@h  OR  @d+@s).

Any questions on how this SIMPLE version of Suction works?
^^
As an example let's restore the earlier hand and bid it with  ^*bthis ^*n version of suction.


^*bMM:^*n At the time of writing the version of Suction on the website  ^*h http://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/Defences.php##suction ^*n is different from that described above.  This of course may change. |

fp|t-title|at|Defending  Against  the  1@C  Opening    -    Suction|fp||at|      continued^^^^|
lg|b|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  This version of Suction is relatively simple to use, but it's also fairly easy to defend against, in that you NEVER have the suit you are actually bidding, which means that the Suction bid itself is ostensibly forcing, and Opps can afford to pass until you show your hand type.

On the other hand, it's far from unknown for the Suction bid to be passed by a partner with a weak hand and a 6+ holding in the suit.

If you're going to take a chance on partner NOT having Hearts, you might as well try to take up as much of Opps' bidding space as possible 

You can play Suction at ^*b ANY ^*n Level

^c(1@c)   -   4@h[@s or both Minors]           So the more distributional your hand, the higher you go.

There are other versions of Suction where you DO potentially have the suit you actually bid.

These are harder to implement but also harder for Opps to combat.

Worth checking out online if you don't like a simple life.


Lets look at an example hand.|

lg|c|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Crash is another fairly popular defence.

|n#|4|fp|t-title|at|Crash|fp||n^|6|at|

^cOver 1@c:

^d@2^*b Double ^*n ^g 2 suits same COLOUR 
^*b 1@d ^*n        ^g 2 suits same RANK
^*b 1@h ^*n        ^g nat
^*b 1@s ^*n        ^g nat
^*b 1NT ^*n        ^g 2 suits same ODD-ness (parity)
^*b 2@c ^*n        ^g a 3-suiter
^*b Jump overcalls ^*n   natural and weak.
^b@2
So it's a tiny bit similar to CRO but uses different bids to show 2-suiters of the same rank or 2 "odd" suits.

I've never tried using CRASH.

You'll have to work out sensible continuations yourselves (or Google it).|

lg|c|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Lastly we come to Amsbury ...one of my favourites  :)

|n#|4|fp|t-title|at|Amsbury|fp||n^|6|at|

Amsbury is very similar to Panama, but with a third option. The Amsbury defence is as follows: 

^*b   Simple overcalls^*n   are natural and constructive.

^*b   Jump overcalls^*n  are either|n#|4|lg|d|at|
^c^*b Single-suited ^*n ^g with that suit
^c^*b 2-suited ^*n ^g with the 2 suits ABOVE the suit bid
^c^*b 3-suited ^*n ^g with the other 3 suits|lg|b|at|

So Amsbury can be seen as a combination of the ideas behind Panama and Suction.  So playing Amsbury, 

^c (1@c)    -    2@h     shows   single-suited Hearts, or the other 3 suits, or a 2-suited with Spades and Clubs.

^c (1@c)    -    2@s     shows   single-suited Spades, or the other 3 suits, or both Minors.
|n#|4|at|
Like Suction (and Panama), you can play it at ANY level from a jump overcall up to the 4-level if you like.

You can also use bids in NT to show a 2-suiter with either round or sharp.

Any questions on what we've covered tonight?|

fp|t-title|at|Defending  Against  the  1@C  Opening    -    Summary|fp||at|^^^^|
lg|b|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  As I said earlier there are literally HUNDREDS of defences fo 1@c.

Many of them are variations on one or more of those that I've covered tonight.

Pick whichever suits your temperament.

The last thing to say is this: Some [good] Precision pairs develop very sophisticated methods for reclaiming space lost due to interference.

These methods can often end up GAINING them space if you interfere CHEAPLY.

Those of you who have come to the previous few sessions will have seen how CHEAP interference from Opps can actually gain us space we wouldn't have had otherwise.

My system incorporates a fairly sophisticated method of coping with it Bids such as Double.

Therefore, just to show the suit bid by RHO, particularly when that suit has been bid artificially as the response to an asking bid, are not generally worthwhile unless you really want that suit led ^*b AND ^*n it looks like partner will be on lead.

You will notice that in both of the conventional defences I have outlined to you, Double means something specific, normally showing 2 specific suits.

This gives you more chance of competing effectively than if you're showing a single suit by double to show the suit that opps have bid.   The key thing to remember in all this is that intervention that uses up a significant amount of bidding space is likely to be much more beneficial to your side.|

fp|t-title|at|Practice / Demo  Hands|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Make your interference count, therefore.

A sequence like     1@c   -   4@s   -   ???     is an absolute killer for a Precision auction.

Here opps are almost worse off than if playing a completely natural system.

So if you have the hand remotely suitable for that kind of intervention, and the vulnerability is favourable, then go the extra mile.

If I don't have the kind of hand that can interfere pre-emptively, I tend to keep quiet, as natural intervention with no real hope of competing is just giving information away to your opponents.

ok, let's practice some hands 4 volunteers please.

cp||at|^*bMM:^*n|cp||at|  We all know we have to alert when playing  'proper'  bridge.

The laws of the game say that what we have to put in the alert is  ^*b our agreement with partner ^*n about that bid.

While creating these bridge movies, I have gone through and added to, or amended, many of the alerts that were in the original text.

I have changed them from being ^*b REAL ^*n alerts, that you should give to real opponents, and have replaced them with ^*b STUDY ^*n alerts.   Study alerts are only useful to students of Oliver's Precision.  Of course in many cases no changes were needed.   For example    1@c     16+ Any dist except 16-23 4441

It is particularly important that we make the alerts for  ^*b Asking bids and their responses^*n,  as clear as possible

An easy mistake in reply to an Epsilon is when, say, you hold ^*b Q76 ^*n in the suit, and so give only ^*b Qxx ^*n in the alert.   THAT  IS  WRONG.  The agreement is ^*b 3rd round control ^*n and that is what should be told to the opps.   

The ^*b ethical ^*n problem with telling too much to your opps is that it disadvantages the other pairs who will play your opponents cards.|
