cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Hi Everyone and welcome to today's Precision Club session, in which we will be starting to look in detail at Precision Asking Bids.

This part of the series will take a couple of months in all.

Tonight we'll be looking at Beta, our equivalent of Blackwood.

If you have not already done so, please have a look at the notes I have prepared on Precision Club bidding.

You can find these on:  ^*h http://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/AskingBids.php ^*n  You will DEFINITELY want to have these on screen in the background for reference during this session.

The page for Beta can be found at  ^*h http://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/Beta.php ^*n If you are new to Asking Bids then there's no way you're going to absorb everything we cover tonight, so please do visit the site and read through the Asking Bid section at your leisure.

fp|t-title|at|The  Beta   Ask|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  The first Asking Bid we're going to look at is Beta.

This is a "general" control-asking bid and is potentially available in most bidding sequences, not just ones where Asking Bids have already been established.

Beta is the Precision equivalent of Blackwood, since it asks how many Aces and Kings partner has in their hand.

Beta is the ONLY Asking bid of this type (ie: one that doesn't have to be part of an Asking Bid sequence, and which doesn't kick off an Asking Bid sequence Generally speaking, the following bids can be Beta: 

^c|cp|r|at|^*b[1]  High-level Beta: ^*n|cp||at|   In natural auctions if a suit OTHER THAN clubs have been agreed, or if Clubs have not been suggested as trumps, then 4@C can be Beta (but see below).

^c|cp|r|at|^*b[2]  High-level Beta: ^*n|cp||at|   If Clubs HAVE been agreed as trumps in a natural sequence, then 4@D can be Beta (but see below).

Next I will show you a hand that we will keep returning to

|lg|f|at|
( ^*bMM:^*n   Remember that, in  Oliver Clarke Precision 
^c 1@c - 1NT      ^g shows  the responder has         @sspades@s      and
^c 1@c - 1@s      ^g shows  the responder has a     ^*b NO TRUMP ^*n    shape hand   ) |

at|     South's bid here is Beta for 2 reasons
|n^|5|at|
Firstly, South is still unlimited here, and since Clubs HAVE been mentioned as a possible trump suit, 4@D is Beta here rather than 4@C.
|n^|5|at|
Secondly, North's bidding to date has highlighted a Diamond shortage in their hand, and, as we will see in a minute, bids in partner's KNOWN short suit can also be Beta.|

bt||
nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|             . . . following on  from 

^c|cp|r|at|^*b[1] and [2]^*n|cp||at|     4@C  /  4@D  (^*bHigh Level Beta^*n in  ^*bnatural^*n  sequences)    

covered earlier.  We now get to...

^c|cp|r|at|^*b[3]  High Level Beta: ^*n|cp||at|   ^*bDuring^*n  Asking Bid sequences  4@C  /  4@D  can be Beta.

^c|cp|r|at|^*b[4]  Relay Beta: ^*n|cp||at|   Perhaps most importantly, these days, whenever we have agreed a trump suit by means of Asking Bids then, if Responder's EXACT number of Controls has not yet been established ^*bTHEN^*n ...
^c@2^*bA relay^*n  in the next bid up (excluding the trump suit and, if we've agreed a Minor, excluding 3NT) over the Trump asking bid response is  ^*bRELAY Beta^*n.
^b@2
^c|cp|r|at|^*b[5]  Low Level Beta: ^*n|cp||at|   After 1@C and a positive response,  ^*b Low Level Beta ^*n is always available: 
             ^t (it occurs nowhere else)
|n^|k|at|
1@C - 1@H/@S - 1NT is Beta
1@C - 1NT   - 2@C   is Beta 
1@C -  2@C    - 2@D   is Beta 
1@C -  2@D    - 2@H   is Beta.
|n^|5|at|
So apart from   1@C - 1@H - 1NT,   a relay in the NEXT BID UP over a positive response is a ^*b Low Level Beta^*n.
|n^|5|at|
^c   (We've not got to Alpha yet (next week): Alpha is a simple bid of a new suit over a positive response to 1@C.)
|n^|5|at|
The last 3 low-level Beta Asks displace an Alpha Ask in the Relay Suit, so that now a 2NT rebid by opener is Alpha in the relay suit.

1@C - 1NT - 2@C    is Beta, and 
1@C - 1NT - 2NT  is Alpha in Clubs.  
1@C -  2@D  - 2@H    is Beta, and 
1@C -  2@D  - 2NT  is Alpha in Hearts.|

cp|r|at|^c^*b[8]  Other Beta: ^*n|cp||at|   There are a number of other specific situations where a bid is Beta.  I can't go through all of these now, because it would take all night to list them.

We'll come to them as we progress with Asking Bids and strong sequences, and re - examine some of the Intermediate Openings.

You'll notice I've tended to say "can be Beta" in some of the above.  This is because it really does depend on the sequence.

Generally speaking, an Opener who has already LIMITED their hand by making an intermediate Opening will not normally have Beta available.  eg: 

^c 1H - 2@C - 3@D(Upper Range, 5 - 5+) - 3@H - ??? 

Here (above) Opener might be upper range, but they've still limited their hand to 15 HCP max, so 4@C by Opener here would be a cue-bid rather than Beta.     On the other hand, take the sequence|lg|f|at|^c@2
1@H - 2@C 
3@H - 3@S
4@C - 4@D
^b@2Here Responder has not limited their hand at all.  
So once Opener agrees Clubs as trumps with 4@C  ^*bTHEN^*n  4@D by Responder is Beta rather than a cue-bid for @d's.

Similarly in the sequence shown in  ^*bTeach 1^*n

North, though IS limited by the mere fact that they've opened a Precision Intermediate Opening.

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Any questions so far?     Or are you all asleep tonight?   :)


^*bRedbird44:^*n  Is the question I need to ask as responder?  -  'Have I limited my hand'  -  so I can tell in advance if my bid will be Beta or a cue-bid?

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Well if you HAVE limited your hand, and partner has NOT, then generally you should be leaving it up to them to make the running in slam investigation.  This is, however, a fairly fluid thing.

The above doesn't mean that a player who HAS limited their hand cannot, for example, initiate cue-bidding if partner seems to be strong but generally using Beta is NORMALLY (not always) left up to the stronger hand.

An exception to this is in  2@D  sequences where the bidding might start   2@D - 2@H - 2@S - 2NT - 3@D(@H shortage).

But although Opener has shown a strong hand, and it's now open to the notionally weaker hand to use Beta in @H.

Essentially we're following what I said above: 

Responder here is completely unlimited (but may have nothing), and Opener HAS now limited their hand by virtue of the  2@S  bid.

Any questions? .|

fp|t-title|at|Normal Scale|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Beta asks Responder how many controls they hold 

^c Ace   = 2   Controls  and a 
^c King  = 1   Control,  (but we don't "count" singleton Kings).

There are a number of different ranges for Beta, depending on partner's KNOWN strength and number of Controls.

A 1-4 step response to Alpha, for example, ALWAYS affects the range used for any subsequent Beta Ask.


^c|cp|h-highlight|at|^*b(a)  NORMAL: ^*n|cp||at|   The Normal Scale is used where Responder's strength not known or is KNOWN to be

intermediate (11-15): 
^c@2
1 Step   shows  0-2 controls 
2 Steps shows    3  controls 
3 Steps shows    4  controls, etc     eg: 
^b@2
1NT - 2@H(Xfer) - 2@S ^j   - 4@C(Beta)      ^q     - 4@S ^s shows  4 controls

1NT - 2@H(Xfer) - 2@S - 3@C(2nd suit) - 3@S - 4@D(Beta - as Clubs bid naturally) - 4@S ^s shows  3 controls.

So in this sequence, we'd be using the Normal scale.  

So here was an example of Beta being used in a "natural" bidding sequence rather than as part of an Asking Bid sequence.

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   The first scale      |cp||at|^*n(a)  NORMAL: ^*n|cp||at|    was covered on the previous full page 


^c|cp|h-highlight|at|^*b(b)  WEAK: ^*n|cp||at|   The Weak Scale is used where Responder is  KNOWN  to have  0-10 HCP (eg: passed hand)

^*bOR^*n  or KNOWN to have fewer than 4 controls (response to an earlier Alpha or Beta Ask): 
^c@2
1  step  shows   No   controls 
2  steps shows   1   control 
3  steps shows   2   controls 
 ^j eg: 
^b@2
Pass - 1@C - 1@S(pos with @S's) - ^*b1NT^*n(Beta) - 2@H          shows  2  Controls

1@C    - 1@H - 1@S(Alpha in @S's) - 2@D(Qxx/xxxx or better, 0 - 3 controls) - 4@C(Beta) - 4@H     shows  1  Control.

^c@2Note that being KNOWN to have 0-3 controls SUPERCEDES the fact that partner might also be known to be Intermediate.  So -
^b@2
1@D - 2@S(Alpha) - 3@D(Support, 0-3 Controls) - 4@C  is now Beta using the WEAK scale, 

^c because although Opener is known to be Intermediate, they are ALSO known to have 0-3 Controls.

As you can see, you ALWAYS have to be thinking about the sequence as a whole to determine WHICH Beta Scale is currently in use |

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   continuing...


^c|cp|h-highlight|at|^*b(c)  SPECIAL WEAK: ^*n|cp||at|    The Special Weak scale is used ONLY when a Low-level Beta is used opposite a 

Responder who is a  ^*bpassed hand^*n  eg.     ^*bPass^*n - 1@C - 1@H - 1NT    is Beta using the Special Weak Scale. 
^c@2
1  step  shows  0 or 1  control 
2  steps shows   2  controls 
3  steps shows   3  controls 
4  steps shows   4  controls, etc   ^j eg: 
^b@2
Pass - 1@C - 1@S(pos with @S's) - 1NT(Beta) - 2@H     shows 3 Controls.

The  ^*bSpecial Weak^*n  scale exists to alleviate the problem of Opener having insufficient room to use a Low-level Beta and still hand over the Captaincy with 2NT.

It gives us that one additional bidding space which makes it more likely that 2NT HoC (Hand over of Captaincy) will still be available over the Low-Beta response. |

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   continuing...


^c|cp|h-highlight|at|^*b(c)  STRONG: ^*n|cp||at|   The Strong Scale is used when Responder is known to be 16+ (most often after a 2@D

 Opening), or known to have 4 or more controls (eg: previous response to Alpha) 
^c@2
1  step  shows  0-4  controls 
2  steps shows   5  controls 
3  steps shows   6  controls 
4  steps shows   7  controls etc 
^b@2

There are, in fact, a further 2 ranges for Beta: These are 

^c|cp|h-highlight|at|^*b(d)  SUPER: ^*n|cp||at|   when responder known to be 24+ (Delta used), and 

^c|cp|h-highlight|at|^*b(e)  RANGE: ^*n|cp||at|   when Responder is Intermediate and circumstances are that their Range is important.

These scales are used infrequently, however, and only in very specific circumstances, so I'm not going to cover them here.

The notes do explain them, though.              ^*h http://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/Beta.php ^*n

You are unlikely to encounter the Range Beta unless and until you start playing the "complex" version of this system.

Any questions.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Scales  continued|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   One thing worth noting: For the purposes of ANY Beta Ask, Singleton Kings are generally @CNOT@C included in our tally of controls @HUNLESS@H we have a good indication from the previous bidding that it's likely to be carrying a decent amount of its "normal weight" (eg: partner has SHOWN that suit).

Suppose you hold    @SK  @HAQJxx  @DQxxx  @CKxx

Partner opens 1@C and the bidding proceeds 

^c 1@C  -  1@H  -  1NT(Low-level Beta)  -  ???     Here you should show THREE controls only.

On the other hand, suppose the bidding starts 

^c 1@C  -  1@H  -  1@S(Alpha)  -  ???      Now you should show FOUR controls, because partner's Ask in Spades makes it MUCH more likely that your @SK really is worth something.

Another time you MIGHT consider counting a singleton King is when partner has shown a very strong balanced hand (24+).

That's just on the balance of probabilities that partner is much more likely to have the Ace and/or Queen of that suit.

Generally, though, we do NOT count singleton Kings as a control.   Indeed I tend not to count singleton K, Q or J in my HCP when evaluating my hand.

Please do not worry if you can't recall the scales in detail.   Have a read through the notes on the Website and perhaps print them out.

Gradually they will make sense and settle down in your memory.|

fp|t-title|at|Other  points|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   A few other points about Beta: 

(1) ^cIn  @2some sequences you can have a SECOND Beta Ask during the same sequence, when the answer to a Low-level Beta got a 0-2 Controls response.

The SECOND Beta will automatically be on the Weak scale in these circumstances.

We never need a third Beta Ask in ANY sequence.


^b(2)^cAs stated earlier, a 1, 2, 3 or 4 - step response to Alpha will ALWAYS affect the Scale in any subsequent Beta (ie: If 1 or 3 steps in response to Alpha, any later Beta will use the Weak Scale, and if 2 or 4 steps in response to Alpha, any later Beta will use the Strong Scale).


^b(3)^cBeta is not ALWAYS the best route to find out what you need to know.

Bear this in mind if, for example, you have a void somewhere and there is, perhaps, one specific suit where you need partner to have their Controls.   Here perhaps better to ignore Beta and use Epsilon instead.


^b(4)^cTry to improve your ANALYSIS skills.

Quite often a degree of concentrated analysis of the hand will tell you a lot about what partner has, their distribution and where their controls are.

This will help you to target your Asking Bids most effectively.|

fp|t-title|at|Try to improve your ANALYSIS skills|fp||at|             continued^^^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   For example, you hold

^c|ih|sakt74 hkqjx dA cAK6|

You open 1@C and the bidding proceeds 
^c@2 
1@C ^f -   1@H (8+ hcp,  5+ @H)
1NT (Beta) ^f -   2@C (0-2)
2@H  (Gamma) ^f -   2@S (No @H Top Honour)
???
^b@2
Is it really worth making a second Beta Ask with 3@C Relay Beta here?   Probably not.

Partner cannot have the Ace of Hearts and the only other Control they can have is the King of Diamonds, so better to find out what degree of control they have in Spades.

If they have no Control of Spades it doesn't matter WHAT else they have, since slam is out of the question.|

An easy mistake in reply to an Epsilon is when, say, you hold ^*b Q76 ^*n in the suit, and so give only ^*b Qxx ^*n in the alert.   THAT  IS  WRONG.  The agreement is ^*b 3rd round control ^*n and that is what should be told to the opps.   

The ^*b ethical ^*n problem with telling too much to your opps is that it disadvantages the other pairs who will play your opponents cards.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   7@C is the ONLY grand slam guaranteed to make.

Spade loser goes on the 5th Heart.

Some will be in 7@H, half of them going off if they get the @S finesse wrong.|
pg| ***** 127 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   The thing here is that once West shows up with KJxx in Clubs and 2nd - round control of Diamonds, East needs to have the "vision" that West MIGHT have  @DKxx,  in which case  7@H  is fine, but they MIGHT have a singleton Diamond, in which case  7@C  is much safer than  7@H

That's a really valuable lesson in the kinds of thought processes you have to go through to really make the most of Asking Bids.|

cp|red|at|^*bOliver:^*n|cp||at|  Okay, we're going to leave it there for tonight. 

I expect that those of you new to Asking Bids have got headaches already. 

Please don't despair.   There is a huge amount to be absorbed on this topic, which is why I've deliberately only covered 1 actual Asking Bid today. 

Please do check out the notes on the website.

The   PrecisionTeaching.doc   and   PrecisionTeaching.pdf   files that can be downloaded are the full notes on what I teach in IAC.

These notes cover the Asking Bids in considerably more detail than I've been able to do today. 

Next week we'll be having a look at Alpha. The notes on the website cover these, so please try to have a look at them before next week.



lute57:  superb lesson Oliver (Winston Churchill would have been proud of you)

Redbird:  ty   @h
