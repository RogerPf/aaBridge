cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Hi Everyone and welcome to today's Precision Club session, in which the plan is that we'll be continuing our look at Precision Asking Bids with a look at two of the most useful trump asking bids, Theta and Iota.

As we'll see this is going to be a fairly easy session for those who were here for the week on Delta

For anyone who has not been to the previous sessions on Asking Bids this is certainly not a "basic" topic.

If you have not already done so, please have a look at the notes I have prepared on Precision Club bidding.

You can find these on: ^*h http://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/index.php ^*n You will DEFINITELY want to have these on-screen in the background for reference during this session.   :)

^c^*h http://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/Theta.php ^*n

^c^*h http://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/Iota.php ^*n

If you are new to Asking Bids then there's no way you're going to absorb everything we cover tonight, so please do visit the site and read through the Asking Bid section at your leisure.

If you want download one of the Precision system documents on the site see
 
^c^*h http://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/Documents.php ^*n

They cover this stuff in more detail.|

fp|t-title|at|Recap  of  Delta|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Last time we looked at Delta, a very strong primary trump asking bid, used only after a 1@D Negative response has been given.

Delta notionally shows a 24+ hand and is a 1@C Opener's only way to FORCE an Asking Bid sequence over a 1@D negative response.
Delta is made by a jump-shift immediately over the 1@D negative response.

Delta asks partner EXACTLY what their holding is in a suit.

^f Remember   ^*bH^*n    =    A, K or Q      (never J or 10)
^d@2
  1    step    ^g -   ^*b     or  ^*n  x
  2    steps   ^g H  ^*b     or  ^*n xx
  3    steps   ^g Hx ^*b    or  ^*n xxx
        |cp|d-feint|at|@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-|cp||at|
  4    steps   ^g HH ^*b     or  ^*n Hxx                   (4 steps or more agrees the suit as trumps)
  5    steps   ^g xxxx
  6    steps   ^g HHx ^*b   or  ^*n Hxxx
  7    steps   ^g HHxx
  8    steps   ^g xxxxx ^*b      or   ^*n xxxxxx
  9    steps   ^g Hxxxx ^*b     or   ^*n Hxxxxx
10    steps   ^g HHxxx ^*b    or   ^*n HHxxxx
^b@2

In the event of a negative response Opener can make a repeat ask in the same suit which asks partner to show which if the two alternatives they have.

The shorter of a given pair of alternatives is shown as 1 step and the longer as 2 steps.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Recap  of  Delta|fp||at|    (continued)^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  A repeat in the SAME suit ALWAYS sets that suit as trumps.

Opener can also make a repeat ask in the SAME suit over a positive response to Delta, but only if it can be made BELOW game level.

In the event of a negative response, Opener can make a repeat ask in a DIFFERENT suit and this would be Iota, one of the Asking Bids we'll be looking at tonight.

Once we've agreed a suit by Delta with or without a repeat ask in the same suit, Relay Beta is available in the next suit up.

...and, of course, we're now in an established Asking Bid sequence, so Epsilons are still available.



Any questions on Delta before we move on? .|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Introduction|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Theta and Iota are both SECONDARY trump asking bids, which simply means that they are NEVER the FIRST Asking Bid in a sequence.

They only occur after either a  LOW-LEVEL  Beta, or after a NEGATIVE response to Alpha or Delta (In the "Simple" System, anyway).



|fp|t-title|at|Theta|fp||at|^^^^|

at|Theta is, in practice, one of the most common ways for Opener to ascertain responder's exact holding in his main trump suit (more common than Alpha).

Theta occurs mainly in 2 situations only: Firstly, where a LOW-LEVEL Beta is used eg:

^c 1@C  -  1@H  -  1NT(Beta) 

then a new suit by Opener over the Beta response is   Theta   eg. 

^c 1@C  -  1@H  -  1NT(Beta)  -  2@D(3 controls)  -  2@S     is Theta   

Secondly, if Alpha gets a NEGATIVE (1 or 2 step) response, then an immediate repeat ask IN THE SAME SUIT is Theta.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Theta|fp||at|    continued^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  A Repeat Alpha/Delta in a DIFFERENT suit is always  ^*bIota^*n, NOT Theta.

If Responder has shown a balanced hand, then any bid that would normally be Theta is IOTA, not Theta.

Any questions on when a bid is Theta ?

The responses to Theta are IDENTICAL to those for Delta, ie:-


^f Remember   ^*bH^*n    =    A, K or Q      (never J or 10)
^d@2
  1    step    ^g -   ^*b     or  ^*n  x
  2    steps   ^g H  ^*b     or  ^*n xx
  3    steps   ^g Hx ^*b    or  ^*n xxx
        |cp|d-feint|at|@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-|cp||at|
  4    steps   ^g HH ^*b     or  ^*n Hxx                   (4 steps or more agrees the suit as trumps)
  5    steps   ^g xxxx
  6    steps   ^g HHx ^*b   or  ^*n Hxxx
  7    steps   ^g HHxx
  8    steps   ^g xxxxx ^*b      or   ^*n xxxxxx
  9    steps   ^g Hxxxx ^*b     or   ^*n Hxxxxx
10    steps   ^g HHxxx ^*b    or   ^*n HHxxxx
^b@2
Thus 
^c 1@C  -  1@H  -  1NT(Beta)  -  2@D           -  2@S(Theta)   -  3@S    shows     xxxx      in Spades 
^c 1@C  -  1@H  -  1@S(Alpha)  -  2@D(Neg)  -  2@S(Theta)   -  3@C    shows   Q or xx   in Spades

as with  Delta  a 4-step response to Theta agrees the suit  ie:   KQ or Qxx|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Theta  |fp||at|  continued^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  An immediate repeat Theta (in the same suit) asks for clarification, and responder always shows the SHORTER of 2 alternatives with 1 step, and the longer with 2 steps.

A repeat Theta always agrees the suit as trumps.

As with Delta Repeat Thetas in the SAME suit over a POSITIVE response are only available BELOW game level.

fp|t-title|at|Theta|fp||at|    continued^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  A Bid in a NEW suit after a negative response to Theta is always Iota (which we're coming to next and is a collapsed version of Theta).

As with Delta, if we agree a suit via Theta then relay Beta is available over the positive response.

So Theta is essentially identical to Delta except that it's used in completely different circumstances to those where Delta is available, and is called something else simply to avoid confusion.

 (Delta is ONLY for hands that are notionally 24+)|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Iota|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   The last of these 3 similar Asking Bids is Iota.

Iota is used in only  ^*b2^*n  places: 

(1)  @2Where responder has shown a balanced hand  ie:   1@C  -  1@s(+8, balanced)   and a low-level Beta Ask has been used, then any subsequent bid that would otherwise be  Theta  is  ^*bnow^*n  Iota

^c    1@C  -  1@S(bal)  -  2@C  -  2@D  -  2@S    is  Iota  in Spades      (the 1@S bid shows a balanced hand not @s's)

^c    1@C  -  1@S(bal)  -  2@C  -  2@H  -  3@D    is  Iota  in Diamonds 

In case anyone misses the reason for this, Iota is a "contracted" Theta, this is because a balanced hand, by definition, cannot contain a singleton or void, so there is no sense in having a response that shows either of those cases.

^b(2)  Any  ^*brepeat^*n   Alpha,  Delta or  Theta   in a  ^*bNEW^*n  suit is  Iota.

^c    1@C  -  1@H  -  1NT(Beta)  -  2@H(4 Ctrls)  -   2@S(Theta)  -   3@C(Q or xx)   -   3@D      is Iota 

^c    1@C  -  1@H  -  1@S(Alpha)  -  2@C(Neg, 4+ Controls)    -   2@D        is Iota

The reason why a repeat   Alpha, Delta  or  Theta   in a different suit is  Iota  rather than  Theta  is simply to try to save a little space.

When Responder has insufficient support for our FIRST suit, the chance of them having a singleton or void in our SECOND suit is very low.

It's not impossible, of course, but just much less likely.|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   So where the sequence starts   1@C  -  1@S(8+ balanced)    then a 1-step response to 

any subsequent  Iota  Ask effectively shows   ^*bxx^*n   since they  ^*bcan't^*n  have a void, singleton or singleton honour.

The rules for Repeat Iota Asks in the same suit (or a different suit) are identical to those for Theta and Delta.

These include,  just bidding a Repeat Iota agrees the suit as trumps,


Any questions so far on Iota? 


The differences between  Theta  and  Iota  are in the response scale and (as just covered) WHERE each is used.

A 3-step response to Iota (ie: showing  HH  or  Hxx)  agrees the suit as trumps so far as Asking Bids are concerned.

So you must follow-up with an immediate bid in No Trumps or later jump-shift into a different suit if you judge that response is insufficient given your trump holding.

So in this respect, Iota is also identical to  Theta  and  Delta  in that any response to any of these Asks that shows  HH or Hxx  agrees the suit.


As with  Theta,  if we agree a suit by means of  Iota,  then Relay Beta is available over the positive response.

As with  Theta  and  Delta, this applies even when the trump suit is SET by means of a repeat ask in the same suit.|

fp|t-title|at|Repeat  Iota  in  a  Second  Suit|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   There is one situation which requires special treatment, the situation being when
^c@2
^c@.   Responder has not shown a balanced hand   [ ie: After a Suit Positive, inc   1@c  -  1NT(Spades) ]

^c@.   Opener has used  Alpha,  Delta  ^*bor^*n   a low-level  Beta   then  Theta  

^c  ^d  @2and      receives a negative response 

and      then makes an  Iota  Ask in a second suit

and      the  Iota  Ask gets a 1-step negative response, showing    ' Less than  Hx or xxx ' , 

and      Opener then makes a repeat  Iota  Ask in the second suit
^b@2
For example
 
^c1@c  -  1@h  -  1@s(Alpha)  -  1NT(No Sup, 0-3 Ctrl)  -  2@d(Iota)  -  2@h(< Hx/xxx)  -  3@d(Repeat Iota)  -  ???

This is a special case as we are using  Iota  in a situation where Responder is not balanced and so might have a singleton or void in that suit.  Therefore a special 3-step scale has to be used for that repeat  Iota  Ask: 

^c 1  step                  ^f  -  ^*bor^*n  x               
^c 2  steps                 ^f          H           ^k( Repeat Iota - ^*bSpecial Case^*n - 'H' is min needed to the suit as trumps )
^c 3  steps                 ^f         xx                  

This special scale does not apply when Responder has shown a balanced hand, since "Less than Hx or xxx" always means a small doubleton in those circumstances.|

fp|t-title|at|Notes  on  Theta  and  Iota|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|    
Theta and Iota are a more common way of ascertaining partner's holding in your main trump suit for 2 reasons: 

^c(1) @2Beta gives a more precise initial reading of controls than Alpha (ie: the NORMAL scale for Beta 
starts 0-2, 3, 4, whereas with Alpha you are either 0-3 or 4+) 

^c(2) Theta/Iota give a more precise picture of partner's exact holding in the suit than does Alpha.

^bThere are, however, two situations where it is often better to use Alpha: 

^c(1) When you have a distributional 2-suiter (at least 5-5), or 

^c(2) Particularly when partner is a PASSED HAND (but sometimes even when they are not), and so the low-level Beta will be using the more expensive WEAK Scale and you judge that the Beta response (even using the Special Weak Scale) will take you just "past" your trump suit and therefore make the later Theta/Iota more expensive.
^b@2
So after   1@C  -  2@C  -  ??? 

If you're intending to Ask about your Heart Suit, you may prefer Alpha in Hearts rather than 2@D Beta, because ANY response to Beta will involve your asking in Hearts at the 3-level rather than the 2-level.

nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Although a repeat Theta/Iota in the SAME suit ALWAYS sets that suit as trumps, there is one situation you must bear in mind: 

^c@2Where  Theta  is a Repeat ALPHA in the SAME suit it is not (initially) a "normal" repeat Theta and a response showing  Hx or xxx  is enough to agree the suit.

If the first Theta gets a "negative" response then a 3rd bid in the same suit does set the suit as trumps and is a "normal" Repeat Theta.

^bFor example

1@C                ^g  -   1@H 
1@S(Alpha)         ^g  -   2@C(No Supp, 4+ ctrls) 
2@S(Theta)         ^g  -   3@C(H or xx  in @S) 
3@S(Repeat Theta)  ^g  -   3NT(H [Singleton Honour])
^b@2
So here the initial  Theta  is a repeat  Alpha  in the same suit.

The 2@s being an "after Aplha"  Theta  means that a response showing  Hx or xxx  would agree the suit

The 3@S is then a NORMAL repeat Theta, asking whether Responder has the  singleton Honour  or  xx  in the suit.

EITHER response will now agree the suit as trumps.|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


bt||
nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Remember the normal rules for trump agreement are 

Delta/Theta: 
^c4-step response or a repeat in the same suit sets the suit as trumps (unless a repeat Alpha in the same suit) 

Iota: 
^c3-step response or a repeat in the same suit sets the suit as trumps.

Since we normally use Theta and Iota (and Delta) with 5+ card suits, these trump agreement rules are geared to agree the suit when Responder has  HH or Hxx  in the suit or better.

You need to bear this in mind if you ever end up making a repeat Theta or Iota in a second suit that is only 4-card length.

Space permitting it might be better to hand over the Captaincy rather than making the Theta or Iota in a 4-card suit, but sometimes it is the only option and you can always sign off in NT's despite "agreeing" the suit if you decide partner's trump holding is insufficient.

Please remember that if Responder has shown a BALANCED hand,  Theta,  as such, is never used, but instead it is ALWAYS Iota.

Lastly, bear in mind that  Theta  and  Iota  are TRUMP asking bids.

Someone sent me an example hand the other day where they'd made a  Theta  ask at the 4-level in a 3-card Club suit rather than establishing agreement in their 7-card Diamond suit and then using an Epsilon in Clubs.

The end result was a complete disaster and if you abuse the system in this way, the results are pretty unpredictable.

Using Theta/Iota as a means to check on stops for the purposes of playing in No Trumps is really NOT a good idea.|

fp|t-title|at|Practice / Demo  Hands|fp||at|^^^^|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|    Apart from the fact that the responses to Theta can be VERY expensive, any response that "agrees" the suit has now completely misled partner as to the direction the auction is taking and you may struggle to sign off in No Trumps.

I've seen this kind of sequence numerous times 

^c1@C   -   1@S   -   1NT  -  2@H(4)   -   3@C(Opener's Clubs are xx) 

Opener is trying to check whether the Clubs are covered or not.

You might get away with this, but if Responder bids 4@C (which shows Hxxx in @C and agrees Clubs), you can't really blame Responder if they don't pass when you try to sign off in 4NT.   :)

If you want to take the risk, then be my guest, but it's really not a good idea, ESPECIALLY in a Major.

Any more questions on Theta or Iota?

ht|d|at|^^|
cp||at|^*bMM:^*n|cp||at|  We all know we have to alert when playing  'proper'  bridge.

The laws of the game say that what we have to put in the alert is  ^*b our agreement with partner ^*n about that bid.

While creating these bridge movies, I have gone through and added to, or amended, many of the alerts that were in the original text.

I have changed them from being ^*b REAL ^*n alerts, that you should give to real opponents, and have replaced them with ^*b STUDY ^*n alerts.   Study alerts are only useful to students of Oliver's Precision.  Of course in many cases no changes were needed.   For example    1@c     16+ Any dist except 16-23 4441

It is particularly important that we make the alerts for  ^*b Asking bids and their responses^*n,  as clear as possible

	    ^c ^*b Study Alert ^*n           ^i ^*b Real Alert ^*n                ^o ^*b It would be great if you could add ^*n
     ^b      @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@- ^h       @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-   ^n       @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-
		^c Beta    Relay Beta ...          ^i Gen Ctrl Ask                    ^o A = 2,  K = 1 
		^c Alpha                           ^i Asking  in                      ^o Trump ...
		^c Gamma                           ^i Asking  in partners suit        ^o Trump ...
		^c Epsilon                         ^i Specific Ctrl Ask               ^o in ... 
		^c Hxx                             ^i Hxx                             ^o in ... 
		^c none  or  1st & 2nd             ^i none  or  1st & 2nd             ^o [xxx, AKx(x)]
		^c 3rd rd ctrl                     ^i 3rd rd ctrl                     ^o [xx, Qxx(x), Qx]
		
An easy mistake in reply to an Epsilon is when, say, you hold ^*b Q76 ^*n in the suit, and so give only ^*b Qxx ^*n in the alert.   THAT  IS  WRONG.  The agreement is ^*b 3rd round control ^*n and that is what should be told to the opps.   

The ^*b ethical ^*n problem with telling too much to your opps is that it disadvantages the other pairs who will play your opponents cards.|

cp|red|at|^*bOliver:^*n|cp||at|  Okay, we'll leave it there for tonight. 

Hopefully this has been a slightly easier session to follow given that it was so closely related to what we covered last week.

Please do check out the notes on the website. 

If you do use the website, please do register and login each time as then it gives me some idea as to what people look at more when they're there.

Please do try to practice these Asking Bids. You will find it difficult to make sense of them unless you do spend some time in the Partnership Bidding Tables doing just that (Set the tables for constrained and 27+ points combined).

Next week we will be having a look at Sigma (A repeat Alpha in the SAME suit after a POSITIVE Response to Alpha) which checks on trump solidity. Hope to see you all then.
