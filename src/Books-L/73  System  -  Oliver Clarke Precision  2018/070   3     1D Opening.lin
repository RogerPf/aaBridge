^^
Do not be afraid to pass with a weak hand,  even with  ^*bno Diamond support^*n.

It is rare that opponents will be able to profit significantly by passing the hand out when they have the majority of the points, whether or not they have Diamonds.

Normally they will bid or double for takeout.|

A rebid of 1NT might conceal a 4 card @s suit

A rebid of 2@H is a reverse promising 5 card @d's in addition to being ^*bMAXIMUM^*n.|

8 - 10  balanced

This bid specifically denies possession of a 4-card or longer Major

A reverse into 2@H or 2@S promises 5-card or longer @d's as well

In practice, Opener will often ^*b pass this response ^*n unless minimum and unbalanced with both minors. In which case the best action will often be for:
|n^|5|at|
   @2^*bOpener^*n to bid  2@C  even if their @d's are longer, 
        @2since the  2@C  bid normally shows 4-5 in the Minors and Responder must have at least 
one  4 card  Minor suit.|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Hi Everyone and welcome to today's Precision Club session when we'll be taking a close look at the Precision One Diamond Opening and Responses.

If you have not already done so, please have a look at the notes I have prepared on Precision Club bidding.  You can find these on: ^*hhttp://ocp.pigpen.org.uk^*n     The 1@D Notes can be found at ^*hhttp://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/1d.php^*n

|fp|t-title|at|The  1@D  Opening|fp||at|
  
This is a catch-all Opening which shows any hand which is not suitable for one of the other intermediate Precision Opening Bids.

It does  ^*bNOT^*n, initially show a diamond suit and DENIES certain holdings more than promising anything in particular.

^c@2The 1@D Opening shows 11-15 points.

It ^*bDENIES^*n having a 5-card major (open 1@H or 1@S).

such as      @sAKx  @hAQx  @d-  @cxxxxxxx     but in practice it promises at least one card @d's.

It needs to be alerted fairly carefully.

My normal Alert for the 1@D Opening in this system is along the lines of 

^f 11-15, No 5@H/@S, No 6@C unless weak, not balanced in 1NT range 

but I have different alerts for different vuls, so I specify the balanced range it CANNOT be.

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  

The 1@D opening does not promise a Diamond suit and indeed can contain as little as a singleton diamond.

This does not mean that the Opening is Forcing, far from it.

With no particularly better contract to suggest and a weak (0-7) hand, Responder should pass and maybe enter the bidding later, but that 0-7 range can be shaded downwards when you have a 5 or especially a 6-card Major to suggest.


Time for the first teaching hand.

This might seem a little crazy when the opening doesn't promise Diamonds, but in practice it almost always works out alright, because if Diamonds are Opp's suit, it will be very hard for them not to double, at which point Opener and you both have a second opportunity to come in.  Statistically, the times when you come seriously unstuck are hardly worth worrying about.

The initial emphasis is on finding a Major Suit fit if one exists. Simple change-of-suit responses are forcing for 1 round.

maysie:  ? Why would Responder (West) raise hearts here ?  -  Opener has already shown a minimum hand.
^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   There's a big range between being Minimum and having a hand worth a game force.
West hasn't shown a "minimum" hand with 2@D, they are simply showing a preference for NOT playing in 1@S, an inability to bid 1NT (or some other number of NT's), and showing a second suit in Diamonds.  This is a natural, non-forcing and constructive sequence.  If East is balanced, they'll be in the 13-15 range here.

nt|^b@2^z@3|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Even a 15-count here with East might not bid more than 2@H over 2@D but that is still a constructive, forward-going move.  

The 1@H by West is a simple 1-round Force which may be no more than 8 points and a desire to find a better resting place than 1@D (ie: a rescue).

The 1@h bid promises only a 4-card suit, but it could be longer.|

A 1NT rebid shows whatever range of balanced hand was unsuitable for a 1NT Opening (ie: 11-12 vulnerable and 13-15 when not vulnerable).

It Specifically DENIES having a 4-card Major.

Please note that we freely raise Responder's Major with 3-card support  IF WE HAVE A RUFFING VALUE.

So on the last hand, East could have potentially raised 1@D - 1@H directly to 2@H without showing the Spades if they liked

I think bidding the Spades first is more constructive, but if the Spades were worse I might not bother.
^^
billyjef:  ? Could East ever bypass a 4-card spade suit to bid 1NT ?

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   No, The emphasis is initially to try to find a Major suit fit if we have one.
^^
So, in the previous hand, a 1NT rebid from East would specifically DENY having 4-card Spades,

as West might be 4-4 in the Majors, better to show the Spades.

One issue that will come up later is whether we treat the 2@C bid as probably showing 4-card Diamonds as well, which makes this a 3-suited sequence and therefore eligible for Lebensohl.

This is beyond the stage we're at at the moment, but worth bearing in mind later on when we look at Lebensohl.

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  1@D - 1NT  is a constructive bid showing 8 - 10 points balanced.

It specifically DENIES possession of a 4-card or longer major.

Over 1@D-1NT,   2@C and 2@D are both natural.

2@C will normally always show  either  5-card Clubs with 4-card Diamonds  ^*bOR^*n  a weak 6-card club suit,
^l but MIGHT also be  4441 shape with a Major suit singleton.

2@D will always promise a 5-card or longer diamond suit.

Opener will normally be unbalanced with a major-suit shortage or weakness, as otherwise they'll tend to pass 1NT or invite in No Trumps.

A MINOR suit shortage in Opener's hand is less of a problem, since a 1NT response from Responder will always have 7+ cards in the Minors.

In practice Opener will often pass after 1@D - 1NT.

Opener should bear in mind, however, that Responder is showing at least 7 cards in the Minor suits, and thus with 5-4 or 4-5 in the minors themselves a minor suit contract might be preferable.

After 1@D-1NT, Opener holding a minimum with ^*b4^*n-card Clubs and ^*b5^*n-card Diamonds might well rebid 2@C rather than 2@D

So that's one exception to rebidding 2@D with 5-4 in the Minors,     Billy

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  1@D - 2@C is a one-round force showing 11-15 points, but normally treated as being forcing to 2NT at least.

Bidding proceeds naturally, but responder will rarely have good diamond support, otherwise they would tend to bid 2@D (which comes next) 

1@D - 2@D is a one-round force with 11-15 points, but like 1@D - 2@C is normally treated as being forcing to 2NT at least.

Bidding proceeds naturally.

Responder is promising at least good 4-card diamond support.

Continuations after  1@D - 2@C  and  1@D - 2@D are  ^*bNOT^*n  identical, especially when it comes to the meaning of a 2 of a Major rebid from Opener.

Over  1@D - 2@C,  a 2 of Major Rebid from Opener is DEFINITELY a reverse, showing a 4-card Major and 5+-card Diamonds in an upper-range hand.

Over  1@D - 2@D,  2 of a Major IS normally showing a 4-card Major (but might exceptionally be showing a good stopper when they have a weakness elsewhere), but doesn't have to be upper-range.

For this reason, if Responder has a 3-suited hand with both Minors and one Major, it is probably better to respond 2@D rather than 2@C, in that Opener can always show a 4-card Major at the 2-level over a 2@D response, so the auction will potentially flow a lot more easily.

nt|^b@2^z@3|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  In both these situations (1@D - 2@C and 1@D - 2@D) a 2NT rebid is showing a lower-range balanced hand (with or without a 4-card Major)

Despite what I said before, this is safe enough, because when Responder bids 2@C or 2@D, they are never going to have a 4-card Major UNLESS they are strong enough (game-going) to reverse into it.

4441 are not completely straightforward when opened 1@D, especially when responder bids 1NT.

The general rule is that with both 4-card majors, Opener will tend to pass, and bid 2@C or 2@D if they have a weakness in a major.

If Opener is maximum, then they will keep the bidding going for one more round, at least, probably by rebidding their lowest Minor.

Hence  1@D - 1@S - 2@C  MIGHT be 1444 with a singleton Spade, especially if a 1NT rebid from Opener would be misleading from the viewpoint of Opener's range.

So if we're vulnerable and Opener has a 1444 15-count, they will  ^*bNOT^*n  want to rebid 1NT over 1@S, because now Responder will put them in the 11-12 range.


magicspy: ? in this bidding sequence, 1@D - 2@D - 2NT is it forcing to game ?
    
|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  No, 1@D - 2@D - 2NT is showing a lower-range balanced hand (for whatever balanced range they CAN have, given the vulnerability) so if we're NOT vul,  1@D - 2@D - 2NT  is showing around a 13-count (balanced) can't be 11-12 or we'd have opened 1NT can't be a bursting 15-count, as otherwise we'll be rebidding 3NT not 2NT.  

billyjef:  and with control in the majors?

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Yes, it'll definitely imply control of the Majors but after  1@D - 2@D,  more likely to be a 5-card CLUB suit than Diamonds 5-card.  If Diamonds, then  1@D - 2@D - 3@D  perhaps more likely.

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Denies 4-card support, might have 3-card support if no ruffing value elsewhere but more likely 2-card support at most. So if 3433 or similar, Opener might rebid 1NT rather than 2@S. But if 3442, 2@S better with 3-card Spade support.

lg|c|
at|^*bMM:^*n  In 2017 There was a thread on the ^*h http://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/smf/index.php, OCP Forums ^*n in which Oliver discussed the Simple System 1@d Opening.   What follows are ^*b extracts ^*n of that thread that might be of interest here, each "paragraph" is a seperate quote.|
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


vx|9999|
at|^^^^^^|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at| For example:  At Game All, You hold,  this an 11 count
|n#|3|ih|sKt5 hqj6 d52 caj742|n#|7|at|
You open 1@D and partner bids  2@D.  Now you have an easy 2NT bid, showing a lower-range balanced hand with no 4 card Major and NO good support for @d's.|  
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


vx||
at|^^^^^^A responder to your 1@d opening will, IF they're strong enough for a game-forcing reverse into the Major, bid their 4-5+ hand in the "normal" order (ie: Minor first).  If they're NOT strong enough to do that, then they'll bid the 4 card Major first at the 1 level.  Therefore we never "miss" 4-4 Major fits with our 1@d sequences. |
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


at|^^^^^^When Responder has both Minors and is strong enough to bid at the 2-level, we use the  1@D - 2@D  rather than
1@D - 2@C,  because the  1@D - 2@D  sequence imposes few limitations on Opener's rebid.  For example, they can freely bid a 4 card Major at the 2 level without promising anything extra in the way of hcp, whereas over 1@D - 2@C , a Major suit rebid by Opener is considered a reverse.

pg| ***** 77 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|at|^^^^|

fp|t-title|at|A Discussion on  1@d  Sequences|fp||at|        (continued)^^^^|
lg|c|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at| After  1@D - 2@C - 2NT,  Opener might be concealing a 4-card Major, because if they bid 2M over 2@C, it's considered a reverse, but that's okay, because the only time Responder will bid 2@C when they have a 4-card Major will be when they're strong enough to reverse into it at the next level (eg: 1@D - 2@C - 2NT - 3@H).   The same thing actually applies to the 2@D Response. 

The difference now is that Opener can freely show a 4 card Major at the 2-level without it being considered a reverse on their part. 

Why the difference?    Because most of the time when Opener has a 4 card Major and 5 card Clubs, the Club suit will be good enough for them to open 2@C rather than 1@D . If they have a lower-range hand with a 4 card Major and 5 card Diamonds they can bid 2@D over a 2@C response, but over a 2@D response, that's not an option and if they simply bid 3@D, the Major will tend to get lost.  So the 2@D response imposes fewer constraints on Opener's rebid than the 2@C response.

Anyway, if Responder has a 4 card Major and a 5 card Minor, but is not strong enough to make a game-forcing reverse into their Major after showing the Minor first, then they simply bid their Major at the 1 level.  After  1@D - 2@C  or  1@D - 2@D, therefore, Responder will not have a 4 card Major unless they're strong enough to reverse into it over Opener's rebid. That in turn allows Opener to make a more natural rebid over 1@D - 2@C  or  1@D - 2@D, especially 2NT.|
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


at|^^^^^^^*bMM:^*n A questioner supplied a set of example hands on the theme of  "Opening 1@d with a long weak @c suit".  These Oliver systematically went through and commented on.  They are reproduced over the next few pages.

|cp|red|at|^*bNOTE ^*n|cp||at| On each deal, you are free to use  { ^*b Enter the Deal ^*n }  and then click {^*b Analyse ^*n} and then click {^*b ShufOp ^*n}  a few times to see what the contract will actually make, given a selection of random defender hands.|

at|The initial response would probably be 1@H rather than 2@D, because Responder isn't strong enough to reverse, so   
^f 1@D  -  1@H  -  2@C  -  2@D  -  3@C  -  pass
is the likely sequence, because Responder will also be downgrading their hand slightly opposite a weak Club suit and the absence of any forward-going move from Opener over 2@D.|

at|Now Responder is good enough to reverse, so  1@D - 2@D - 3@C - 3@H - 4@D - 5@C/5@D.   Actually I think I'd rather be in 5@C than 5@D on this hand.   Responder will know that Opener cannot have 4-card Diamonds (else 3@D more likely than 3@C). Again Clearly Opener is lower-range and has made no move towards 3NT so will almost certainly have a marked weakness in one of the Majors.  As Responder I'd be slightly worried about retaining trump control if Opener's hand is going to get forced in one of the Majors (particularly if it's Hearts) and so playing in Opener's long Club suits looks more attractive.|

at|Once again, Responder not strong enough to reverse, so 1@D - 1@H - 2@C - 2@D - 3@C - 4@C - 5@C is the likely sequence.   I wouldn't ^*i^*b dream^*n of trying to play this hand in 3NT, because Responder's hand is an effective 9 count (the @SQ may be worth nothing at all), Opener has made no forward-going move over 2@D and so is clearly lower-range and unbalanced.   As Responder I would probably bid 4@C over 3@C, therefore, and now Opener will probably come to life and bid the game on the basis of the probably 10 card @C fit, their ruffing value in Hearts and Diamond fit.   5@C is an excellent contract on these 2 hands, but 3NT pretty much doomed from the word go, especially if Opps attack Hearts.|

at|Again, Responder not strong enough to reverse here, so 
^h 1@D - 1@S - 2@C - 2@D - 2@S - 3@D - 3@S - pass 
is the likely sequence. Opener will give preference to Spades (might even bid 2@S over 1@S - we have no fear of Moysian fits) and now Responder is worth a long trial bid in Diamonds, but Opener really not good enough to bid game in Spades, despite their void Heart and help in Diamonds.|

at|Some players might even venture   1@D  -  3@D(^*bAlpha^*n)    on this hand, but I don't like the poor points in the Majors, so I'd probably be bidding 2@D to find out more naturally.  So  
^d 1@D  -  2@D  -  3@C  -  4@S(Splinter in @H for @C)  -  5@H(Beta, Strong Scale)  -  5NT(5 ctrls)  -  7@C 
is the likely sequence.   Once Responder splinters to show a Heart shortage, Opener's hand becomes massive, hence 5@H Beta. When Responder shows 5 controls,  Opener will be expecting  @DA  and  @CAK  opposite.|

^f 1@D  -  2@D  -  3@C  -  3@H  -  3@S(4th SF)  -  3NT
Responder is strong enough to reverse into hearts over 3@C, now a 4SF in @s's and Responder is happy to oblige. Opener would probably choose this route specifically to protect Responder's Heart holding.|

ht|d|at|^^|
cp||at|^*bMM:^*n|cp||at|  We all know we have to alert when playing  'proper'  bridge.

The laws of the game say that what we have to put in the alert is  ^*b our agreement with partner ^*n about that bid.

While creating these bridge movies, I have gone through and added to, or amended, many of the alerts that were in the original text.

I have changed them from being ^*b REAL ^*n alerts, that you should give to real opponents, and have replaced them with ^*b STUDY ^*n alerts.   Study alerts are only useful to students of Oliver's Precision.  Of course in many cases no changes were needed.   For example    1@c     16+ Any dist except 16-23 4441

It is particularly important that we make the alerts for  ^*b Asking bids and their responses^*n,  as clear as possible

	    ^c ^*b Study Alert ^*n           ^i ^*b Real Alert ^*n                ^o ^*b It would be great if you could add ^*n

		^c none  or  1st & 2nd             ^i none  or  1st & 2nd             ^o [xxx, AKx(x)]

An easy mistake in reply to an Epsilon is when, say, you hold ^*b Q76 ^*n in the suit, and so give only ^*b Qxx ^*n in the alert.   THAT  IS  WRONG.  The agreement is ^*b 3rd round control ^*n and that is what should be told to the opps.   

The ^*b ethical ^*n problem with telling too much to your opps is that it disadvantages the other pairs who will play your opponents cards.|

at|East might bid 2@S over 1@S given his ruffing value in @H.
^^Over 2@D by East, West is right to bid 3@S rather than 2@S given their fit for @D and nice 6-card @S suit and a double fit.
^^One thing that West will appreciate is that the 2@D bid has IMPROVED their hand.|

at|^^^^Playing in  1@D redoubled  is also fine.  The redoubled overtricks will easily compensate for not reaching game.

at|Yes  -  2@d  is ALWAYS better (than 2@c) when you have both Minors because it makes life better for Opener.|

at|^^^^As I said earlier,  1@D - 2@D  is always better when Responder has both Minors because it puts much less pressure on Opener, who can now freely show a 4-card Major, whether reversing or not  but over  1@D - 2@C - 2Maj  is ALWAYS a reverse.|
