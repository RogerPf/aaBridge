^^^^
There is NEVER any doubt about which  Asking Bid  is being used.

The "rules" concern the relative "importance" of the various types of Asking Bid: 
^d@2
^c[1]  Agreeing trumps is the most important thing, You can't start asking about control in a side suit if you don't know what the trump suit is (and therefore which suits ARE the side suits).

Thus Trump Asking Bids generally take precedence and Epsilon (asking about controls in a side suit) cannot be used UNLESS we've already specifically "agreed" a trump suit.

^c[2]  Similarly, there normally not much point in floundering about Asking about degrees of control in side suits (with Epsilon) if you've no idea how many controls partner has in total, so finding out about partner's GENERAL level of controls is the number two priority.

^c[3]  Finding out about the specific degree of control partner has in side suits is generally the least important thing and so is the lowest thing on the Asking Bid totem pole.
^b@2
^^So   (1) Agreeing trumps,   (2) General Controls, and   (3) Specific Controls   is the order that determines things.

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Hi Everyone and welcome to today's Precision Club session, in which we start the second portion of this course and start looking at Super-Precision Asking Bids.

This part of the series will take a couple of months in all.

Generally speaking the Asking Bids are not going to be much, if any, use to you unless you are going to play Precision as it is not very easy or practical to graft them onto systems like 2/1 or Standard American.

This is certainly not a "basic" topic.

If you're not familiar with "Basic Precision" Openings and Responses, then this will be a very difficult session for you to follow or to get anything from.

You're welcome to stay anyway and hopefully you'll find this interesting but I also guarantee that you will find it confusing if you've not attended most of the sessions in this Series thus far.

I apologise to anyone who is put out by this, but there's not much point in confusing yourself by introducing an advanced topic into your system if you're not au fait with the basics.

If you're in that position please stay by all means, but have the paracetamol ready to hand, LOL!|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  If you have not already done so, please have a look at the notes I have prepared on Precision Club bidding.

You can find these on:  ^*h http://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/AskingBids.php ^*n You will DEFINITELY want to have these onscreen in the background for reference during this session.

If you are new to Asking Bids then there's no way you're going to absorb everything we cover tonight, so please do visit the site and read through the Asking Bid section at your leisure.

If you want, download one of the Precision system documents on the site, they cover this stuff in more detail.

Visit  ^*h http://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/Documents.php ^*n


^^|fp|t-title|at|Principles and Underlying Rules|fp||at|^^^^|

at|Okay, there's a great deal of introductory stuff on Asking Bids before we get to the Asking Bids themselves, so please bear with me.

Mostly, today, we're going to be concerned with GENERAL PRINCIPLES and UNDERLYING RULES for Asking Bids.

We will start on the Asking Bids themselves next week.

Super-Precision Asking Bids really are the fun side of Precision but they are a LOT of hard work to start with.

Asking Bid sequences normally occur after a POSITIVE response to a  1@C  Opening but can commence with a jump-shift over an intermediate Precision Opening  (eg: 1@D - 2@S),  and elsewhere.

The system I teach makes extensive use of Asking Bids and they are, in my view, what makes the system soar majestically above other varieties of Precision and certainly above other systems.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Asking Bids are unequivocably SLAM INVESTIGATIONS.

That doesn't mean that you are committed to play in a slam, but we are ALWAYS in a game-forcing situation if Asking Bids are used.

They are normally used BY the strong hand (asking the questions) with the weaker hand answering the questions (but not always).

The Asker is therefore not revealing anything much about their hand but, by the end of the Asking Bid sequence knows all (hopefully) the salient points about the responding hand.

In many instances you will find that the "Asker" can virtually write down partner's hand at the end of the sequence.

We also aim that the stronger hand will normally become Declarer, but this is not always possible.

Firstly there is no longer any such thing as a "standard" set of Asking Bids.

What I'm going to introduce to you over the next few weeks might have started life as "standard" Super-precision Asking Bids 40 years ago, but over the years they've been refined and tuned, and they're based on the set of Asking Bids that I developed with Jason Hackett in the 1980's, but which have now been developed further still.

I originally used Eric Jannerstern's excellent book on Precision Club, but the Asking Bids now bear very little relation to what you'll find in there, or indeed to what you'll find in Garozzo & Belladonna's definitive book on Super-Precision.

The moral is that you really must get yourself a regular Precision partner if you're going to bother with Asking Bids.

Learn and practice the Asking Bids together.

Don't expect to sit down opposite an unknown Precision player and have any kind of instinctive meeting of minds where Asks are concerned, because it's very unlikely to happen unless you're confining yourself to Asking Bids like Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Epsilon.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Asking Bids require a LOT of partnership discussion and hard grafting practice to get the hang of them.

This takes time and a LOT of effort, but the results speak for themselves.

Jason and I discussed and practised these Asking Bids for several MONTHS before we actually used them in anger.

I really can recommend you get into the Partnership Bidding Rooms for this purpose.

You can set the conditions there so you are always getting dealt game or slam hands and get some CONCENTRATED practice on these sequences.

I use the letters of the Greek alphabet to name the Asking Bids I use.

There are other "schemes" such as TAB (Trump Asking Bid), CAB(Control Asking Bid) etc, but I find that that's too generic and doesn't help when you have about 6 different Trump Asking Bids and, in any case, they give give me a pain in the abs.

So I use Alpha, Beta, Gamma etc.


Any questions or comments thus far?


The valium working nicely, I see :)|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Ok, let's firstly deal with some of the more general concepts behind Asking Bids: The responses to Precision Asking Bids are in STEPS above the Asking Bid itself, so we tend to talk about a 2-step response, 3-step response etc.

Thus if  2@S  is the Ask, then  
^c@2
2NT  ^dis the 1-step response,  
3@C  ^dis the 2-step response and  
3@D  ^dis the 3-step response, etc etc etc.
^b@2
The Ask normally relates to the suit bid, but the response never does, except by coincidence.

It goes without saying that Asking Bids AND Responses need to be alerted fully :)

As we'll see a bit later on when we consider Interference over Asking Bid sequences, there are some occasions (when Opps interfere over the ASK) when Double/Redouble becomes the 1-step response, Pass becomes the 2-step response, and the first actual "step" is the 3-step response, in an attempt to recover lost space.


Asking Bids are asking VERY SPECIFIC questions about partner's hand.

eg:  "What is your EXACT holding is in Hearts"  or  "What degree of control do you have in Clubs?"  or  "How many Aces and Kings have you got?".

Each Asking Bid has a range of possible responses, some open-ended and others with a limit on the number of steps responder can bid.

All the stepped responses have tightly pre-defined meanings.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


bt||
nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Furthermore, the range of steps and their meaning for a given Asking Bid often changes according to the exact circumstances.

If, for example, Responder has already shown 4+ Controls in response to an earlier Ask, there's no point having a scale for Controls that starts 0-2, 3, 4, 5, so in that situation we'd use a scale that starts 0-4, 5, 6, 7.

Any questions on the idea of stepped responses?


^^|fp|t-title|at|Terminology|fp||at|^^^^|

at|Alright, let's cover some terminology first: When we start talking about CONTROLS generally, we're dealing with Aces and Kings.

In "Precision-speak" an Ace is worth 2 Controls, and a King worth 1 Control.

Thus a hand like    @SAQJxx  @HKJ7x  @DQx  @CAK    contains 6 controls.

The Alpha, Beta and Zeta  Asking Bids enquire about the number of Controls partner has in their hand.


Let's look at a full deal.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |

nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  The West hand contains 3 controls (AK) ^mThe North hand contains 5 controls (AAK) 
^d  The East hand contains 1 control (K) ^mand the South hand contains 3 controls (AK)

As you can see the pack contains 12 controls.

We tend NOT to count a singleton King as a control UNLESS partner has already shown some strength in that suit.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


bt||
nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Suit Quality|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  When we start talking about SUIT Quality, we're dealing with Top Honours and length.

In the examples, if I say a bid shows Hxxxx, then that simply means a 5-card suit with one of the top 3 honours, so that might mean Qxxxx, Kxxxx or Axxxx.

Gamma, Theta, Iota and Eta Ask about suits in these terms.

Eta is always in regard to a 4-card suit and when Eta is used we're also interested in whether or not partner has the Jack.

Gamma (asking about RESPONDER's suit) is also concerned with trump LENGTH.

Normally the MINIMUM length of the suit is 5, but sometimes it'll be 6 (Gamma after a weak 2 opening, for example) and occasionally it'll be 4 (Gamma after a 2NT response to an Opening 2@D, for example).

There is always a set minimum length for a Gamma Response UNLESS the length of Responder's suit is already known (eg: after a weak 2).

That would bring into play a different scale that is similar to the responses for Eta, which is asking about a known 4-card suit Any questions about the terminology for showing suit length and quality?  


Note that Gamma and Eta both ask about Responder's suit rather than one of the Asker's suits.


When we get to asking about the specific  DEGREE OF CONTROL  held in a suit (Epsilon Asks), then the exact holding is shown, ie:  ^*bQx^*n  really does mean the doubleton queen.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


bt||
nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|fp|t-title|at|Degree of Control|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Because we're dealing with side suits once we've agreed a trump suit  "Degree of Control"  is interested in shortages as well as top honours.


In the example hand I gave before   @SAQJxx  @HKJ7x  @DQx, @CAK    this hand is said to have 
^c@2
1st AND 3rd Round Control of Spades (AQx),  

2nd Round Control of Hearts (Kxx),  

3rd Round Control of Diamonds (Qx) and  

1st, 2nd AND 3rd Round Control of Clubs (Stiff AK).
^b@2


So Shortages, as well as Honour Cards count as a "degree" of control.


Let's return to the earlier example deal.|

pg| ***** 14 ***** |


bt||
nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|fp|t-title|at|More on  Degree of Control|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  So a holding of Ax is said to have 1st and 3rd round control of the suit, 1st round control because of the Ace and 3rd round control because partner can ruff the 3rd round of the suit.

We almost always show ALL of the degrees of control that we can in response to Epsilon Asks (unless over pre-emptive interference)

However, if the topmost degree of control is a shortage (eg: North's Heart Singleton), then we only show it as 2nd round control, NOT 2nd and 3rd, even though technically North can also control the 3rd round of the suit.  

Any questions so far on degree of control?


^*bRedbird44:^*n  A stiff Ace?  -  1st and 2nd?   

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Yes and a stiff AK is 1st, 2nd ^*bAND^*n 3rd. 
^^

|fp|t-title|at|Repeat Asks|fp||at|^^^^|

at|A quick look at Repeat Asks.

Most of the Asking Bids have the facility of a REPEAT Ask, if necessary.

These questions are clarifying Responder's holding in some way and the answers are ALWAYS dependent on the answer to the INITIAL question.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Thus if the strong hand makes an Epsilon Ask (about the degree of control held in a side suit) in Clubs, and gets a response of "2nd and 3rd round control", a subsequent ask in the SAME suit (which doesn't have to be immediate) would be asking what KIND of "2nd & 3rd" round control responder has [Kx, KQx, KQ stiff, KQxx(x), KQJx(x)], ALL of which holdings are 2nd and 3rd round control.

Where Responder has shown 2 degrees of control in response to the first Ask (eg: 1st & 3rd, 2nd & 3rd, 1st & 2nd), a second ask in that suit is asking about the nature of the lower degree of control.

Thus is the first ask got an answer stating "2nd & 3rd round control", a repeat ask is asking what KIND of 3rd round control Responder has (because the 2nd round control will always be an honour) 

So Kx is 2nd and 3rd round control, because the King provide the second round control, but on the 3rd round they'll be able to ruff.
^^

|fp|t-title|at|Rules|fp||at|

Now we move on to some of the "rules" that underpin our use of Asking Bids.

These you must get to know until they are second nature, because you cannot successfully use Asking Bids unless you know them completely.

Some of the "rules" are specific to particular Asking Bids and we'll cover those when we get to the Asking Bid in question, but...

The critical point is that there can NEVER be any doubt as to WHICH Asking bid is being used at any one time.|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Some Asks are only used in very specific circumstances, the relative importance of agreeing trumps, finding out partner's general level of controls, and finding out about controls in a specific side-suit all determine which Asking Bid is being used.

This might seem improbable to you now, but as we move through the Asking Bids, you will see how the rules governing this work.

There is NEVER any doubt about which ask is being used.

The "rules" concern the relative "importance" of the various types of Asking Bid: 
^d@2
^c[1]  Agreeing trumps is the most important thing, You can't start asking about control in a side suit if you don't know what the trump suit is (and therefore which suits ARE the side suits).

Thus Trump Asking Bids generally take precedence and Epsilon (asking about controls in a side suit) cannot be used UNLESS we've already specifically "agreed" a trump suit.

^c[2]  Similarly, there normally not much point in floundering about Asking about degrees of control in side suits (with Epsilon) if you've no idea how many controls partner has in total, so finding out about partner's GENERAL level of controls is the number two priority.

^c[3]  Finding out about the specific degree of control partner has in side suits is generally the least important thing and so is the lowest thing on the Asking Bid totem pole.
^b@2
So (1) Agreeing trumps, (2) General Controls, and (3) Specific Controls is the order that determines things.

This is not a straight jacket, though, but it is the touchstone that decides which Asking bid is being used if there is any potential doubt.

(This will become clearer as we proceed).|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Trump Asking Bids always take precedence to start with, but once we've agreed a trump suit, ALL of those Asks (apart from repeat asks) are put away, "back on the shelf" and only Control asks are available.

Clearly there will be some hands where the ONLY thing you need to find out is, for example, partner's SPECIFIC degree of control in one particular suit.

The rest of their hand might be totally irrelevant.

The rules for Asking Bids merely set an order of priority for the Asking Bids.They do not mandate that you ALWAYS have to use the Asking Bids in the same sequence.

It merely determines WHICH Asking Bids are available and where.

Thus if we've agreed Spades as trumps, for example, and the last "response" was  3NT,  then  4@C  Beta (General Controls) TAKES PRECEDENCE over  4@C  Epsilon (SPECIFIC Control in Clubs), because General Controls has a higher priority than suit-specific control.

It doesn't mean you HAVE to bid  4@C  over the  3NT  response.

The Asker always decides what information they require most urgently and what they can and cannot afford to ask about.

On the other hand, if we'd already established Responder's exact level of control earlier in the auction, then  4@C  WOULD be Epsilon, because Beta is out of the window.

Similarly I have to stress that you CANNOT make an Epsilon Ask UNLESS we've actually agreed trumps first.|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  So if you in the position that you have a monster hand with a long solid Heart suit and are only interested in finding out whether or not partner has the Queen of Spades, you must get Hearts agreed FIRST (by whatever means) before you can enquire about partner's Spade holding.

You "knowing" that Hearts is where you want to play the hand doesn't count, because partner doesn't know your Heart holding.

This is quite a common area of confusion for those new to Asking Bids.

You have to use the MECHANISM of Asking Bids to agree the suit even if it's blindingly obvious to you (the asker) that that is going to be the trump suit.

Any questions of the relative order or priority of the different KINDS of Asking Bids?

I think at this stage, this is enough talk from me.

Let's show you a few examples of Asking Bids in action Remember that you do NOT have to remember the details about the specific Asking Bids today.

Just try to get a general flavour and see how the rules I've outlined for you are applied: |

nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  You're right, Jen, but you need to go a step further.
^^Ok, this is quite a hard one to spot, but it goes like this:|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |

pg| ***** 37 ***** |

pg| ***** 38 ***** |


cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   NO!!!!!, it isn't|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  South started by showing a 5+ @h suit (1@H response to 1@S) and if South also had  xxxx  in  @S,  then they'd only have 4 cards in the Minors, which means that 

either they'd have @DKx, @CKx,   ^*bOR^*n    Kxx in one minor and a singleton King in the other.

In the first case South would show 2nd AND 3rd round control in  ^*bboth^*n  Minors, and in the second case (with the singleton King) South would not show it as a control, so we can discount that posibility.|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  This means that the old thing that fits is that South MUST have the  K@S, K@H and  so 

ONE of their minor suit  2nd round controls  must be a shortage rather than the King.     (We don't know which).

So South must be    @SKxx  @HKxxxx(x)  @DKxx(x)  @Cx     (or the Minors the other way around).|

nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Positive and Negative Trump Responses|fp||at|^^^^|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  That brings us nicely onto the next topic:

Another concept to grasp is that most of the Trump Asking bids to do with assessing trumps have negative responses and positive responses.

These are positive and negative in terms of whether the suit is subsequently agreed as trumps for the rest of the sequence.

If the Ask gets a POSITIVE response, then the suit is agreed as trumps and all OTHER Trump Asking Bids go into the bucket.

If the Ask gets a NEGATIVE response, then we've NOT agreed a suit and Trump Asking Bids are still active.

So if the response to the Trump Ask is "negative", then the suit is not automatically agreed as trumps, and normally the Asker can ask again in the same suit or in a different suit.

Some Asks automatically agree the suit as trumps by the mere fact that they are used (eg: Gamma & Eta, both of which are asking about RESPONDER's suit) and another unconditionally SETS a suit as trumps, whatever Responder's holding (ie: Zeta).

The rules for trump agreement are different for each kind of trump asking bid.

When the strong hand is asking about one of THEIR OWN suits, and since we're usually asking about 5+-card suits, a response that shows at least  Hxx  or  xxxx  always agrees the suit as trumps (and a holding of "HH" often does too).

We'll come back to the criteria for trump agreement in more detail when we cover each of the Trump Asking Bids.|
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Bidding Space|fp||at|^^^^|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Bidding Space is almost always at a premium in Asking Bid sequences.

For this reason, as I mentioned earlier, some of the Asking Bids have different "Ranges" available to try to make optimum use of the space available whilst still maintaining the required degree of "precision" in the response.

Beta, for example, is our equivalent of Blackwood and asks how many Aces and Kings partners hand has.

There are actually SIX different ranges for Beta (Normal, Weak, Special-Weak, Strong, Super and Range).

To give you some idea the Normal range for Beta is used when partner's exact strength is unknown or when it is known to be intermediate (and the stepped responses are 0-2, 3, 4, 5...).

The Weak Scale is used when partner is known to be weak (0-10) or known to have less than 4 Controls (and the stepped responses are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4).

We saw an example of the weak scale in action in the  Teach 1  deal.  

The Strong scale is used when partner is KNOWN to be 16+ (relatively rare unless Responder is asking the questions over a 2@D Opening) or more commonly when partner is already KNOWN to have 4 or more controls 
 (eg: 2 or 4 step response to a previous Alpha Ask, both of which show 4+ Controls).

Apart from the Special Weak scale (which we'll cover next week), the other Beta ranges are fairly rare and you needn't worry about them overmuch.

Any questions?|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Captain's Choices|fp||at|^^^^|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Once a suit has been agreed as trumps, Asking Bids tend to continue until the Captain of the Hand returns to the agreed trump suit at game level or above, unless this bid is obviously invitational (eg: a jump to the 5-level in an agreed major suit).

However, a jump-shift into a suit OTHER than the agreed trump suit is almost ALWAYS "to play".

Sometimes for economy the Captain has to "lie" by pretending to agree one suit as trumps, all the while knowing that he is eventually going to play in a different one.

For example, Opener might have a very long solid suit (AKQJ10xx) but not want to impose that suit as trumps unconditionally, because they want to find out Responder's holding.

Using Alpha would probably take THREE asks in the suit, so perhaps agreeing RESPONDER's suit is a cheap alternative and then jump-shifting into their suit later in the bidding.|
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Which sequence to choose?|fp||at|^^^^|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Which sequence to choose ?  Well experience and judgement count for a lot here.

There is almost always more than one possible route and it is often impossible to tell to start with which will end up being the most economical one.

Economy is always worth striving for.

...but it cannot be guaranteed...

The trick is to continually evaluate the information you've gained thus far, and take ALL of the inferences from the responses you've had.

Sometimes the answer to one "question" will mean that you don't have to ask a different question about another suit.

Sometimes you have to change direction because of an unexpected response.

Be flexible.

Asking Bids do take a HUGE amount of concentration and effort to get right.  

We saw an example of that in the first example hand (Teach 1).  

However, the effort taken to learn the Asks and Responses, to learn the underlying rules that govern which ask is being used, and the degree of concentration required to put all this to good effect is REALLY worth the effort as sometimes Asking Bids will guide you to the correct contract when few if any other pairs are able to get there, if relying on "natural" methods.|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |

nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Practice / Demo  Hands|fp||at|^^^^|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  "Crafting" Asking Bid sequences is a skill you will acquire only gradually.

Even then, you will not get it "right" 100% of the time (I certainly don't).

It's also important to realise when you need to STOP Asking, because you cannot afford one of the possible responses.

If any of the possible responses to an ask would take you beyond the safe level, then you cannot afford to ask (but you might KNOW that the more expensive responses to, for example, an Epsilon Ask, are NOT possible, because all of Responder's controls are accounted for)

Let's show you some Asking Bid sequences in action.

For tonight only, since we've not yet discussed any Asking Bids in detail.

Can I ask that only people who are really comfortable with Asking Bids sit to play, and we'll give you a demonstration of Asking Bids in action.

ht|b|fp|z|at|^^^^^^^^^^^|fp|x-insertAlert|at|^- A small insert on Alerts^*n^-^^|cs||fp||cp||at|^^|

ht|d|at|^^|
cp||at|^*bMM:^*n|cp||at|  We all know we have to alert when playing  'proper'  bridge.

The laws of the game say that what we have to put in the alert is  ^*b our agreement with partner ^*n about that bid.

While creating these bridge movies, I have gone through and added to, or amended, many of the alerts that were in the original text.

I have changed them from being ^*b REAL ^*n alerts, that you should give to real opponents, and have replaced them with ^*b STUDY ^*n alerts.   Study alerts are only useful to students of Oliver's Precision.  Of course in many cases no changes were needed.   For example    1@c     16+ Any dist except 16-23 4441

It is particularly important that we make the alerts for  ^*b Asking bids and their responses^*n,  as clear as possible

	    ^c ^*b Study Alert ^*n           ^i ^*b Real Alert ^*n                ^o ^*b It would be great if you could add ^*n
     ^b      @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@- ^h       @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-   ^n       @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-
		^c Beta    Relay Beta ...          ^i Gen Ctrl Ask                    ^o A = 2,  K = 1 
		^c Alpha                           ^i Asking  in                      ^o Trump ...
		^c Gamma                           ^i Asking  in partners suit        ^o Trump ...
		^c Epsilon                         ^i Specific Ctrl Ask               ^o in ... 
		^c Hxx                             ^i Hxx                             ^o in ... 
		^c none  or  1st & 2nd             ^i none  or  1st & 2nd             ^o [xxx, AKx(x)]
		^c 3rd rd ctrl                     ^i 3rd rd ctrl                     ^o [xx, Qxx(x), Qx]
		
An easy mistake in reply to an Epsilon is when, say, you hold ^*b Q76 ^*n in the suit, and so give only ^*b Qxx ^*n in the alert.   THAT  IS  WRONG.  The agreement is ^*b 3rd round control ^*n and that is what should be told to the opps.   

The ^*b ethical ^*n problem with telling too much to your opps is that it disadvantages the other pairs who will play your opponents cards.|
