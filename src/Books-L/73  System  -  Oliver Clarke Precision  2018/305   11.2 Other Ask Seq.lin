cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Hi Everyone and welcome to today's Precision Club session, in which we'll be taking a second look at some of the Precision Openings, that we've already covered in previous lessons, and that change once we start using Asking Bids.  This week we are looking at the Intermediate Openings.

If you have not already done so, please have a look at the notes I have prepared on Precision Club bidding.

You can find these at: 
^d^*h http://ocp.pigpen.org.uk ^*n 

The notes on Major Openings can be found at: 
^d^*h http://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/1h.php^*n 
^d^*h http://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/1s.php^*n 

We'll also be looking at 1@d, 1NT, 2@c and 2NT, of course and even 3@c.

fp|t-title|at|Major Suit openings 1@H and 1@S|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Okay, first of all today we're going to look at Major Suit openings of 1@h and 1@s and how Asking Bids tie in with those.

We have covered these to some extent over previous months, but now we can nail these sequences down completely: So first we come to Major Suit sequences where Responder bids 1NT with a game-going hand which contains primary support for Opener's major.

If we are using Asking Bids then the "long-weak suit" variety of response goes out of the window (unless responder a passed hand) and then after the Forcing 1NT response and Openers subsequent bid of their 2nd suit...   

...a bid in the        cheapest  NEW   suit is ^*bGamma^*n in Opener's major.
...a bid in the ^*b 2nd ^*n cheapest NEW suit is ^*bGamma^*n in Opener's 2nd suit   OR   as ^*b BETA ^*n if no 2nd suit shown.
^c@2
1@h  -  1NT  -  2@c  -  2@d(Gamma in @h)
1@s  -  1NT  -  2@c  -  2@d(Gamma in @s)
1@h  -  1NT  -  2@c  -  2@s(Gamma in @c)
1@s  -  1NT  -  2@c  -  2@h(Gamma in @c)

1@h  -  1NT  -  2@d  -  2@s(Gamma in @h)       
1@s  -  1NT  -  2@d  -  2@h(Gamma in @s)
1@h  -  1NT  -  2@d  -  2@s(Gamma in @d)
1@s  -  1NT  -  2@d  -  2@h(Gamma in @d)

1@h  -  1NT  -  2@h  -  2@s(Gamma in @h)
1@h  -  1NT  -  2@h  -  3@c(Beta)                   ^l as  @c's   is  2nd cheapest suit and no 2nd suit shown by Opener

1@h  -  1NT  -  2@s  -  3@c(Gamma in @h)
1@s  -  1NT  -  2@s  -  3@d(Beta)                   ^l as  @d's   is  2nd cheapest suit and no 2nd suit shown by Opener

fp|t-title|at|Exclusion Beta     (VOID)|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Exclusion Beta occurs after a 1@h or 1@s opening and in principle used by 11-13 hcp Responding Hands that have extreme distribution WITH good trump support.

Exclusion Beta shows a VOID in the suit bid, and uses the STRONG Beta Scale, Asking Partner to ignore any controls they might have in the excluded suit.

It's aimed at finding "perfect fit" slams on sub-minimum values where Opener has good controls that aren't wasted in the exclusion suit.

The actual number of hands that will qualify for the use of Exclusion Beta is actually fairly small, because of the way Exclusion Beta actually works.   eg: 

^c 1@s    -   4@d    ^h@2shows  a VOID in @d, excellent trump support, and is Exclusion Beta, asking about the number of Controls Opener has OUTSIDE of @d's.

ih|QJ432 KQ5432 - K2|n#|7|at|
^b@2
|ht|p|at|^^^g@2Eg: you as RESPONDER hold this hand and Declarer opens 1@s.

Now 4 @d is Exclusion Beta and we'll find out if Partner has enough controls OUTSIDE Diamonds for us to make a Small or Grand Slam.

^b@2If Partner has 0-4 Controls  outside Diamonds, then any slam is a dead duck, but if 5 or 6 we can bid a small slam and the magic 7 will mean a Grand is on the cards.|

fp|t-title|at|Exclusion Beta     (Singleton)|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  The other use for Exclusion Beta is when Responder has a similar type of hand but with a singleton rather than a void.

Now Responder bids 1NT first and then jump-shifts into their singleton suit over Opener's rebid.

This type of Exclusion Beta tells Opener to counts the Ace of the excluded suit but to ignore the King of that suit.

An example of this kind of hand (after Partner has Opened 1@h might be^^ ^d| 
ih|12  K5432  KQJ32 A2|
lg|c|at|^^
The bidding goes

^c1@h   -   1NT  -   2x   -   3@s    ^k@2the 3@s bid shows the singleton @s, tells Partner to ignore ONLY the @sK   and asks for Controls using the  STRONG  scale.

Again, 5 controls are enough for a small slam and 6 might be enough for a Grand.

^b@2Exclusion Beta ALWAYS agrees Opener's Major, and so (space permitting) Epsilons are permitted over the Beta response.


Time for an example.|

fp|t-title|at|After 1NT  and Stayman|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  There are two Asking Sequence "portals" after Stayman has been used over a 1NT Opening. Ie:
^c@2
1NT  -  2@c  -  2@h  -  3@s  ^j Eta in @h's
1NT  -  2@c  -  2@s  -  3@h  ^j Eta in @s's

^b@2In both of these situations the bid of the OTHER major (other than the one Opener has shown) is ETA in the Major Opener DID bid.

In both cases, Asking Bids are now established and Relay Beta is available over the Eta response, and Epsilons thereafter.
^^^^^^^^|fp|t-title|at|Alpha after 1@d|fp||at|^^^^|
at|Jump-shifts immediately over a 1@d or 1NT Opening by an UNPASSED hand, are Alpha in the suit bid.

These are treated EXACTLY as Alpha over a positive response to 1@c, including the availability of Sigma, its precedence over Relay Beta if/when there is a conflict (eg: over interference).|

--------------------------------------------------------------------
qx|2C,wide|
nt|^z   @3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|After the 2@c  Opening|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Next we come to the 2@c Openings.

Here immediate jump-shifts by Responder are Alpha in the suit bid, but there are other ways by which we can get into a full-blown Asking Bid sequence:    Firstly, after
 
^c@22@c  -  2@d  -  2@h/@s,   a bid at the 3  -  level in the OTHER Major is Eta in Opener's Major.

2@c  -  2@d  -  2@h  -  3@s  ^j is  Eta in @h's    ^o(almost identical in a way to the 
2@c  -  2@d  -  2@s  -  3@h  ^j is  Eta in @s's    ^o Stayman sequences on the previous page).

^j@2In both of these cases Relay Beta is available over the Eta Response and Epsilons are also available.
^b@2Secondly, after 
^c@2
2@c  -  2@d  -  2@h/@s  -  4@c  ^j @2the bid of 4@c is a ^*b length known ^*n Gamma in @c's (because with 4-6+, the 3@c Opening would have been used).        Similarly after 
^c@2
2@c  -  2@d  -  3@c      -  4@c ^j and 
2@c  -  2@d  -  2NT    -  4@c^j the immediate bid of 4@c is Gamma in @c's with a 6 card minimum length.
^b@2
It is true, that with  3406  or  4306,  Opener STILL uses the 2@c Opening, but these hand-types are pretty rare.

^b@2At the end of the day, it's a matter of partnership agreement  whether you use a length-known or length unknown Gamma with the

^c2@c  -  2@d  -  2@h/@s  -  4@c 

sequence.|

nt|^z   @3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|After the 3@c  Opening|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Next we come to 3@c.

Over 3@c, 3@h and 3@s show slam interest in that suit.

Now Opener relays in the next bid up
 
^c3@c  -  3@h  -  3@s  ^h@2@{  to show 4-cards in the OTHER Major (Responder is more likely
^c3@c  -  3@s  -  3NT  ^h@2@{  to bid 3@d if they have slam interest in EITHER Major).

^b@2Now  4@c  by responder is Gamma in Clubs.

^c3@c  -  3@h  -  3@s    -  4@c(Gamma in @c's)
^c3@c  -  3@s  -  3NT  -  4@c(Gamma in @c's)

If Opener by-passes the bid above relay then these are ETA Responses for the Major that Responder just bid, promising a 4-card holding in that suit.    So

^c3@c   -   3@h   -   4@d(Eta Response)       showing two top honours in @h's without the Jack.

Now a relay over the response is Relay Beta and asking bids are established so Epsilons are permitted.

Needless to say, with length and strength in BOTH Majors, Responder normally does better to bid 3@d over 3@c to find out which Major Opener has, and then 4@d (Beta) over Opener's Rebid.

This implicitly agrees the Major Opener has shown, and so Epsilons can be used over the Beta Response.

Any questions on Asks over a 3@c Opening? |

fp|t-title|at|After the Multi-style 2NT Opening|fp||at|^^^^|
lg|c|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Last but not least, we come to the Multi-style 2NT Opening.

There are quite a few portals for Asking Bid sequences here: Firstly after 
^c@2
2NT   -   3@c   -   3@d/3@h(Majors)    -     4@c(Gamma in @h)
2NT   -   3@c   -   3@d/3@h(Majors)    -     4@d(Gamma in @s)
^b@2
In each case Asking Bids are now established (so Relay Beta and Epsilons follow).     Similarly, after 
^c@2
2NT   -   3@d(Pref)   -   3@h(Majors) -     4@c(Gamma in @h)      and asking bids are now established
2NT   -   3@d(Pref)   -   3@h(Majors) -     4@d(Gamma in @s)      and asking bids are now established
^b@2
Where Responder bids a Major over 2NT (ie: strongly invitational with that Major and a Minor), there aren't any portals for Asking Bids, because the Major suit bid is itself an Enquiry, asking Opener to clarify their hand-type and range.

Again after the sequence   2NT - 3NT,  the most common continuation is a 4@c bid by Opener, which shows a Major 2-suiter (because with Clubs or the Minors, Opener will usually pass 3NT).        After 

^c2NT  -  3NT  -  4@c  

we rely on a 4@d Enquiry rather than Asking Bids as such, but in all continuations a Beta ask is defined.

Even when Opener DOES continue with both Minors over   2NT - 3NT,   there is always a Beta ask defined, but no other Asking Bids are allowed.|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


--------------------------------------------------------------------
nt|^z   @3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|After the Multi-style 2NT Opening         |fp||at|continued^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  The other sequence where Asking Bids come into our methods is after the sequence 
^c@2
2NT  -  4@c ^hshowing a strong distributional hand and forcing Opener to clarify their hand-type: After 
^c
2NT  -  4@c   -   4@d(Majors)    -    ??,        now  4NT  is Gamma in Hearts and  5@c  is Gamma in Spades.

^bIn each case Asking Bids are now established and so Relay Beta and Epsilons follow.   After 

2NT  -  4@c   -   4@h(Minors)    -     ??,       @2now  4@s  is Gamma in @c's and 4NT is Gamma in @d's and 
     as above, Asking Bids are now established.
^b@2
When, however, Opener shows long @c's (2NT - 4@c - 4NT) all continuations are strictly natural and no Asking Bids are allowed.

One last thing in relation to Major 2-suiters is the effect the 2NT Opening has on Asking Bids after sequences such as 

^c1@s  -  1NT  -  3@h

Because  5-5 Major 2 suiters are opened with 2NT, and that sequence promises AT LEAST 5-5, it follows that that sequence is promising at least 6-5 distribution.

The minimum length for a Gamma in either Major has to be amended accordingly, so 

^c1@s  -  1NT  -  3@h  -  4@c        here the  4@c   bid is Gamma in @s, with a ^*b minimum length of 6 cards^*n.|
