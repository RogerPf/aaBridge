|cp||at|^*bMM:^*n|cp||at|  This class was given in  June 2018  during a later 12 month long cycle of OCP lessons.  

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Hi Everyone and welcome to today's Precision Club session, in which we'll be completing our look at what to do when opponents interfere during our Asking Bid Sequence.

Over the last few weeks we've been looking at how we cope with opposition interference during our Asking Bid sequences.

Over that same period, a discussion has been continuing in the OCP Forums on how we should define "pre-emptive interference"  ...or rather "re-define" it.   The existing definition dates back to the very first version of OCP (late 1970's and early 1980's) and hasn't change much until now.

Those discussions are now complete and the OCP Asking Bid Interference has now been changed to reflect what I'm going to explain to you today.

The ^*h http://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/AskingInterference.php, Asking Bid Interference ^*n page on the OCP site has been updated and as with the rest of the system is the ultimate reference for OCP.

So what's this all about?   Up until now we've defined  '^*bpre-emptive interference^*n'  fairly simply (a jump by Opps to a level at or beyond 3NT).

In a number of ways that simple definition has been shown to be inadequate and not to give sufficient scope to doubling interference by Opps for penalties.

We also recognised that there were a number of tangential aspects to this whole question that weren't properly explained or, in some cases, defined at all in the OCP system notes.|

fp|t-title|at|Up until Now|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Over the past three weeks, we have split Asking Bids into the following groups:

   |cp|h-highlight|at|^*b[A.] ^*n|cp||fg|y|at|^e Intervention immediately over a  1@C  Opening^*n                      ^t |fg|n|at|  |cp|r|at|^*bChapter 10.1|cp||at|

   |cp|h-highlight|at|^*b[D.3]^*n|cp||at|^c    &^*b  Pre-empt Interfer over a POSITIVE Response to 1@C^*n   at the ^*b 5 ^*n level |cp||at|
^^
|n#|3|cp|h-highlight|at|^*b[B.2]^*n|cp||at| above is completely unaffected by any of these changes, in that for |cp|h-highlight|at|^*b[B.2]^*n|cp||at|  "pre-emptive interference" is STILL defined as a jump by Opps (over an Ask) to a level at or beyond 3NT.

D1P2 and R1P2 still always apply, as covered in that lesson  and as before ...

The contracted scales ^*b ONLY ^* kick in when Opps  JUMP  over the Asking Bid to a level at or beyond 3NT.

The only other thing worth mentioning at this point is to remind you (as Teller) that in the event of ^*b 4 LEVEL ^*n interference over your positive response to 1@c, if Asker uses Alpha (rather than Pass=Leb or Gamma) then the responses REDUCE to only 2 LEVELS.|lg|g|at|^c@2

^^^^|fp|t-title|at|Point and Purpose|fp||at|
     
^*bMM: ^*n  One thing that is easy to miss out on is the point and purpose of the (quite complex) descriptions that follow.

The core idea is that in some circumstances we want to have a mechanism to BOTH switch on the use of the compressed tables and to be able to ^*b DOUBLE ^*n the Opps for ^*B PENALTIES^*n.  To do the latter we need to remove a bid from the set of meanings covered in the previous 3 chapters.

The actual method is to define situations in which the meaning of a ^*b PASS ^*n (by Asker)  is changed so that it instructs Responder to ^*b DOUBLE ^*n so Asker can then either PASS (for penalties) or bid on.

Oliver chooses to call this    ^*b" PASS ^*n which forces a ^*b DOUBLE "^*n  |fp|t|cp|red|at|^*b Lebensohl^*n|cp||fp||at|.  To me using this name for what is really just a "forcing relay" causes confusion (with real Lebensohl), but I guess we have to live with it.

Others have suggested  'Oliversohl'  and you will see  'Pass=Lebensohl'  on the OCP webiste.  but best of all (IMO) is just to think:
 ^f^*b PASS  forces  DOUBLE^*n
^^The question now becomes   when does     PASS  forces  DOUBLE      apply ?|

fp|t-title|at|Two changes to ^*b D1P2 ^*n and ^*b R1P2 ^*n backwards asking|fp||at|         One^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   There are two NEW exceptions to when D1P2 and R1P2 backwards asking when NOT in any normal pre-emptive situation such as those just covered.
|lg|c|at|
The first of these is  -  any time (over pre-emptive interference OR otherwise) when 
|n#|5|at|^cAsker's RHO makes a 
^f@2lead-directing ^*bDouble^*n  of a
^*nresponse to a previous Asking bid ^*n that is 
in a side-suit which has 
NOT been the subject of an Epsilon Ask.

^d@2In these circumstances ^*b R1P2 ^*n effectively becomes ^*b R0P1 ^*n in that 
Re^*b-Double^*n  is an Epsilon Ask in the suit RHO has just ^*bDoubled^*n (rather than the suit below that).
^*bPass ^*n        also moves up one step  hence   R0P1
|n#|7|at|
^bExample
|lg|g|at|
^c@21@c     ^f-    1@h
1NT(Beta)   ^f-    2@d
2@h(Gamma)  ^f-    3@h 
4@d(Epsilon)^f-    5@c(2nd & 3rd)
^b(X) - ??? ^j@2Re^*b-Double^*n     is Epsilon in @c's (rather than @s's)
^*bPass^*n               is Epsilon in @s's.|   
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


   
nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Two changes to ^*b D1P2 ^*n and ^*b R1P2 ^*n backwards asking|fp||at|         Two^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   The second exception is normally going to be immediately over a positive response to 1@c when Asker's RHO makes any kind of ARTIFICIAL overcall where they don't PROMISE the suit they've actually BID.

Now, once again, D1P2 effectively becomes D0P1 in that 
^i@2^*bDouble^*n   is now ^*b Alpha ^*n in the suit Asker's RHO actually BID
^*bPass^*n       remains Gamma/Beta depending on the nature of the positive
^e@2
This, therefore, will routinely apply to overcalls such as Panama, Amsbury, and standard Suction, for example, but might also apply in other situations.
|lg|D|at|
^bExamples

^b1@c  -  (p)  -  1@h  -  (2@c = @d or @h+@s)   -  ?    ^l@2^*bDouble^*n  is  Alpha in @c
^*bPass^*n      is  Gamma in @h

^b1@c  -  (p)  -  1@s  -  (2@d = @d or @c+@h+@s)  -  ?   ^l^*bDouble^*n  is  Alpha in @d
^*bPass^*n      is  Beta


^bBut don't forget: 

^b1 @c  -  1NT  -  (3@h = @h's  or  @h+@s)  -  ? ^lThis is now  "pre-emptive", and as Asker's RHO definitely has @H's
^*bDouble^*n  is Gamma in @s's, 
^*bPass^*n      is 'Lebensohl'|

nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Order of Preference|fp||at|         ^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Next up is Order of Preference: 

^c@.   @2If the interference on Asker's right is considered "pre-emptive", then 
^*bPass^*n='Lebensohl'  takes precedence over anything else.

^c@.   @2Just as  ^*bPass^*n='Lebensohl'  takes precedence over anything else, Sigma likewise takes precedence over Relay Beta or any other Ask if there is interference over the Positive response to Alpha and Sigma would be a Relay rather than a bid in the trump suit.

^c@.   @2Lastly whether or not  ^*bPass^*n='Lebensohl'  or Sigma are "in play", Relay Beta takes precedence over any other Ask if IT is in play.

.
^b@2So take the following sequence: |lg|h|at|^c@2
  1@c       -        1@h
  1@s(alpha)  -  2@d(0-3,+sup)

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|...which nicely brings us onto the question of Sigma at Game Level: 
|lg|d|at|
We have had a POSITIVE response to an Alpha Ask 

It is possible but very rare, for Sigma to be at Game Level WITHOUT interference from Opps, when it is, (so we can distinguish between Sigma and a Sign-Off). ^m ^*b Sigma ^*n is - the next bid up.

If there is NO interference then the normal rules apply
|n^|9|at|
^cOver a  3 or 4 step  positive (below game level), ^m ^*b Sigma ^*n is - an immediate repeat of the agreed trump suit.
^cOver a  5+ step positive response  ^m ^*b Sigma ^*n is - a the next bid up.

If there  is   NON Pre-emptive  ^*b Interference^*n  
^cif game of the agreed trump suit is within 2 bids,  ^m ^*b Sigma ^*n is - the next ^*b step ^*n up and  ^*bRelay beta ^*n is above that.
^cif the agreed trump suit is within 2 bids,  ^m ^*b Sigma ^*n is - an immediate repeat of the agreed trump suit.
^cotherwise                                   ^m ^*b Sigma ^*n is - the next ^*b step ^*n up and  ^*bRelay beta ^*n is above that.

fp|t-title|at|Interference over a Positive Double|fp||at|         ^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Positive Doubles NOW kick in at 2@h, but it is still up to each partnership to decide their own level.

In practice that still means that Positive Doubles only come into play when there has been a jump-bid by Opps over the 1@c Opening.

If, therefore, Asker's RHO BIDS anything over the Positive Double, we have automatically satisfied the new definition of Pre-emptive Interference (because one Opp has jumped and Asker's RHO has bid something).

The criteria for using a Positive Double, however, has NOT changed.

It remains a hand worth a positive response, but with no "good bid".

This will often mean a relatively balanced hand but with an insufficiently good holding in Opps suit to make a balanced positive.

That doesn't have to be the case, however.  Sometimes a Positive Double will be preferred to a positive in a poorish suit, especially if it would be a relatively expensive bid.

Since the new criteria for "Pre-emptive Interference" has been satisfied, a 
^c^*bDouble ^*n    by Opener  ^his ^*b  Beta ^*n        ^k     (in recognition of the fact that Responder is most often balanced)
^c@2^*bPass                 " ^*n ^his ^*b 'Lebensohl' ^*n 

^bAn alternative approach has been suggested, which is that a 
^*bPositive Double ^*n    is treated as PENALTY-orientated, especially at favourable vulnerability.
Opener simply passes if they feel the situation is right, given their hand.
If, however, Opener doesn't fancy converting the Positive Double into a Penalty, they simply continue, as now.
|n^|5|at|
The website doesn't currently have continuations if Opener's RHO bids over such a penalty-orientated double, but I will update it as things are confirmed.|

fp|t-title|at|Repeat Trump Asks|fp||at| ^^^^|
lg|m|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Repeat Trump Asks are not normally available at game level unless slam values have been established or Teller decides their hand is worth treating them as a repeat trump ask, because they're indistinguishable from a sign-off.

In the event of interference in front of Asker, however, we can "count backwards" to a repeat ask in the trump suit, and the rule is that we DO include the trump suit in backwards asking.

When there is ^*b pre-emptive interference ^*n in front of Asker at game level, it is very easy to distinguish between a repeat trump ask and a sign-off, however, as the sign-off will always go via 

^cthe         ^*bPass^*n='Lebensohl'          sequence

this means that     ^*b backwards asking will always ignore the trump suit^*n.|

ht|d|at|^^|
cp||at|^*bMM:^*n|cp||at|  We all know we have to alert when playing  'proper'  bridge.

The laws of the game say that what we have to put in the alert is  ^*b our agreement with partner ^*n about that bid.

While creating these bridge movies, I have gone through and added to, or amended, many of the alerts that were in the original text.

I have changed them from being ^*b REAL ^*n alerts, that you should give to real opponents, and have replaced them with ^*b STUDY ^*n alerts.   Study alerts are only useful to students of Oliver's Precision.  Of course in many cases no changes were needed.   For example    1@c     16+ Any dist except 16-23 4441

It is particularly important that we make the alerts for  ^*b Asking bids and their responses^*n,  as clear as possible

	    ^c ^*b Study Alert ^*n           ^i ^*b Real Alert ^*n                ^o ^*b It would be great if you could add ^*n

		^c Beta    Relay Beta ...          ^i Gen Ctrl Ask                    ^o A = 2,  K = 1 
		^c Alpha                           ^i Asking  in                      ^o Trump ...
		^c Gamma                           ^i Asking  in partners suit        ^o Trump ...
		^c Epsilon                         ^i Specific Ctrl Ask               ^o in ... 
		^c Hxx                             ^i Hxx                             ^o in ... 
		^c none  or  1st & 2nd             ^i none  or  1st & 2nd             ^o [xxx, AKx(x)]
		^c 3rd rd ctrl                     ^i 3rd rd ctrl                     ^o [xx, Qxx(x), Qx]
		
An easy mistake in reply to an Epsilon is when, say, you hold ^*b Q76 ^*n in the suit, and so give only ^*b Qxx ^*n in the alert.   THAT  IS  WRONG.  The agreement is ^*b 3rd round control ^*n and that is what should be told to the opps.   

The ^*b ethical ^*n problem with telling too much to your opps is that it disadvantages the other pairs who will play your opponents cards.|
