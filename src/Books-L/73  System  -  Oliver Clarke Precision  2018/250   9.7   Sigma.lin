cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Hi Everyone and welcome to today's Precision Club session, in which the plan is that we'll be looking at the latest addition to our Asking Bid arsenal, Sigma.

This should be a fairly easy week for those who followed the session on Alpha, but will be a little incomprehensible to those not familiar with Alpha For anyone who has not been to the previous sessions on Asking Bids  this is certainly not a "basic" topic.

If you're not completely familiar with "basic Precision Openings and responses, then this will be a difficult session for you to follow or get much from.

If you have not already done so, please have a look at the notes I have prepared on Precision Club bidding.

You can find these on: ^*h http://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/index.php ^*n.

You will DEFINITELY benefit from these onscreen in the background for reference during this session <grin>.

http://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/Sigma.php If you are new to Asking Bids then there's no way you're going to absorb everything we cover tonight, so please do visit the site and read through the Asking Bid section at your leisure.

If you want download one of the Precision system documents on the site 

    See  ^*h http://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/Documents.php ^*n ).

They are fairly large (around 500k) but cover this stuff in more detail.|

fp|t-title|at|Recap  of  Alpha|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Okay, Since Sigma relates SOLELY to Alpha, I'm going to recap Alpha briefly.

Alpha is a primary Asking Bid and is always the FIRST Asking Bid in a sequence if it is used at all.

Alpha is found in only 3 places (except in the Complex System): 

^c@.  New Suit Bid (Not the low-level Relay Beta) over a positive response to 1@C

^c@.  2NT rebid over a  1NT,  2@C  or  2@D  response to  1@C  is Alpha in the Relay Suit

^c@.  @2Jump-Shift over a  1@D, 1NT  or  2@C Opening
^b@2
Alpha Asks about support for Opener's suit (the suit bid) and about Responder's general level of Controls.

There are 4 basic responses and then the scale becomes open-ended scale covering the cases where 

Responder has GOOD Support (Hxxx or better) and 4+ Controls.

nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Alpha|fp||at|     Responses^^^^|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   The responses to Alpha are as follows  (a 3-step or greater response agrees the suit)

3 ^f 0-3          ^h     at least     ^k    "                  ^n"       ^q agrees trumps  (as do the following)
4 ^f    4 +       ^h     exactly      ^k    "                  ^n" 
|cp|d-feint|at|        @-@-@-@-@-@-@-|cp||at|               
5 ^f    4         ^h                  ^k ^*bHxxx^*n       & more        
6 ^f    5         ^h                  ^k    "                               
7 ^f    6         ^h                  ^k    "                               
   etc...
^b@2
So for the purposes of this session, we are only interested in occasions when Alpha gets a 3-step or greater response and so the suit is agreed as trumps

In the event of a NEGATIVE response to Alpha, an immediate repeat in the same suit is Theta (a Response 
showing  Hx or xxx  agrees the suit now) and an immediate bid in a new suit is Iota (or Gamma if Responder's suit).

We covered those last week.

In the event of a 3 step response to Alpha, a bid in the next suit up is Relay Beta and Sigma is the bid above that.

Over a 4 (or more) step response the next bid up is Sigma the Relay Beta is the bid above that.

So the Repeat of the Trump suit is  ^*bSigma^*n  and a    ^*bbid in the suit ABOVE^*n    the agreed suit is  ^*bBeta^*n.

O, any questions about Alpha before we have a look at Sigma ?|

fp|t-title|at|Sigma|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  The Asking Bid we're going to look at tonight is Sigma, a fairly new addition to our weaponry.

Sigma occurs in one place only, which is IMMEDIATELY over a POSITIVE response to Alpha (NOT after a 1 or 2 step response).

nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Sigma|fp||at|          (continued)^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Sigma is used to check on trump solidity by asking Responder to clarify their trump holding.
|lg|c|at|
The thing to remember is that trump "support" for the purposes of Alpha is an "all or nothing" affair.

If you have  ^*b Hxx ^*n or ^*b xxxx ^*n (or better)  in the suit then you show support.
It's only if you have  ^*b 4+ controls ^*n  AND at least ^*b Hxxx ^*n in the suit that the "asker" has any indication as to how good that support is.

Sigma fills that gap in that it allows the Alpha Asker to ascertain exactly how good Responder's trump support is after a POSITIVE response.


This the only way the strong hand can check on trump solidity (except perhaps by a process of elimination).

As was said earlier

Over a  3 or 4 step  positive response to Alpha ^m(0-3 ctrls, ^*b Hxx ^*n or ^*b xxxx ^*n or better)
^c an immediate repeat of the agreed trump suit BELOW game level is ^*b Sigma^*n.

Over a  5+ step positive response to Alpha      ^m(level minus 1  ctrls,  ^*bHxxx ^*n or better)
^c a bid in the next bid up is ^*b Sigma^*n
^c (no relay Beta is required)


the Steps for  Sigma  follow...|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  If Sigma is used and the response shows 2 or more top honours then a relay over the Response is Beta.

If Responder showed No Top Honours or only 1 then the Relay is a repeat Sigma (see later) and the next bid after that is Beta.

Let me stress, a Repeat Sigma is ONLY available if Responder shows No Top Honours or only 1 top honour.

If responder shows 1 or no top honours in response to Sigma, then a Repeat sigma is permitted to ask if Responder has the Jack of the trump suit.

Now 1 step denies and 2 steps promises.

If a Repeat Sigma is used, then a relay over the response is Relay Beta if required, otherwise Epsilon.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Sigma|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  So a Repeat Sigma (if available) takes PRECEDENCE over Relay Beta


^c 1@C  -  1@H  -  1@S(Alpha)  -  2@H(Supp, 4+)  -  2@S(Sigma)  -  2NT(xxxx)  -  ???
 
    ^f Now  3@C  is a Repeat Sigma asking about the Jack   and   3@D  is Relay Beta.
    

^c 1@C  -  1@H  -  1@S(Alpha)  -  2@D(Supp, 0-3)  -  2@S(Sigma)  -  3@S(HHxx)  -  ???

    ^f Now there is NO Repeat Sigma and 3NT is Relay Beta
    
      
^c 1@C  -  1@H  -  1@S(Alpha)  -  2@D(Supp, 0-3)  -  2@S(Sigma)  -  3@C(Hxx)  -  3@D(J@S?)  -  3@H(I don't have it)  -  ???

    ^f Now 4@C is Relay Beta

fp|t-title|at|Repeat  Sigma|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Repeat Sigma is available when Responder shows     NO top honours     ^*bor^*n    only 1 top honour.  

If Opener themselves has only 1 top honour, then the presence or absence of the Jack adds considerably to the chances of you losing a trump trick in addition to any other controls you might be missing.

Sigma is used quite rarely,  as it can easily use up space that is normally better used for Epsilons.

Sigma comes into its own when Opener has very few Epsilons that need asking  ^*band^*n  trump solidity is really an issue for the purposes of bidding a slam.



Let me put the first hand back up.   ^m^*bMM:^*n  Now called   Teach 3   but still the first hand.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
 

at|^*bisabable:^*n     ? Does it cause a conflict when 3NT could be   Relay Beta   and also  Repeat Sigma ?

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   No, because Repeat Sigma ALWAYS take precedence over Relay Beta.  

Similarly, an initial Sigma (after a 3 or 4 step response to Alpha) is in the trump suit itself, and Relay beta is NEVER in the trump suit.

Over a 5 step or greater response to Alpha, we know Responder's exact number of controls anyway, so  Relay Beta  doesn't arise.

For example Opener has     @SK10983  @HA  @DKQJ107 @CAK      The Bidding goes 

^c 1@C  -  1@H  -  1@S(Alpha)  -  2@H(Supp, 4+)

With 4+ Controls, Partner MUST have the 2 sharp Aces, and so it looks 6@S is a shoe-in.

But Opener really needs to know how good Partner's Spade support is and no amount of Epsilons elsewhere will tell him whether partner has the  @sQ  or  @SJ   of Spades.

So Sigma is most often used when Opener is pretty strong, but has a relatively weak trump suit, so trump solidity is the most critical factor.|

ht|d|at|^^|
cp||at|^*bMM:^*n|cp||at|  We all know we have to alert when playing  'proper'  bridge.

The laws of the game say that what we have to put in the alert is  ^*b our agreement with partner ^*n about that bid.

While creating these bridge movies, I have gone through and added to, or amended, many of the alerts that were in the original text.

I have changed them from being ^*b REAL ^*n alerts, that you should give to real opponents, and have replaced them with ^*b STUDY ^*n alerts.   Study alerts are only useful to students of Oliver's Precision.  Of course in many cases no changes were needed.   For example    1@c     16+ Any dist except 16-23 4441

It is particularly important that we make the alerts for  ^*b Asking bids and their responses^*n,  as clear as possible

	    ^c ^*b Study Alert ^*n           ^i ^*b Real Alert ^*n                ^o ^*b It would be great if you could add ^*n
     ^b      @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@- ^h       @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-   ^n       @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-
		^c Beta    Relay Beta ...          ^i Gen Ctrl Ask                    ^o A = 2,  K = 1 
		^c Alpha                           ^i Asking  in                      ^o Trump ...
		^c Gamma                           ^i Asking  in partners suit        ^o Trump ...
		^c Epsilon                         ^i Specific Ctrl Ask               ^o in ... 
		^c Hxx                             ^i Hxx                             ^o in ... 
		^c none  or  1st & 2nd             ^i none  or  1st & 2nd             ^o [xxx, AKx(x)]
		^c 3rd rd ctrl                     ^i 3rd rd ctrl                     ^o [xx, Qxx(x), Qx]
		
An easy mistake in reply to an Epsilon is when, say, you hold ^*b Q76 ^*n in the suit, and so give only ^*b Qxx ^*n in the alert.   THAT  IS  WRONG.  The agreement is ^*b 3rd round control ^*n and that is what should be told to the opps.   

The ^*b ethical ^*n problem with telling too much to your opps is that it disadvantages the other pairs who will play your opponents cards.|

cp|red|at|^*bOliver:^*n|cp||at|  Okay, we'll leave it there for tonight. 

Sigma a relatively easy Ask to explain. 

Next week we'll be finishing off with a look at Zeta and Eta.  Please do check out the notes on the website. 

If you do use the website, please do register and login each time as then it gives me some idea as to what people look at more when they're there. 

Please do try to practice these Asking Bids.  You will find it difficult to make sense of them unless you do spend some time in the Partnership Bidding Tables doing just that.   Set the tables for constrained and 27+ points combined.
