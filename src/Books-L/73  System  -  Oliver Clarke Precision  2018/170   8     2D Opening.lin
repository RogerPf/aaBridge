^*b20 - 23^*n  hcp      any  4441  shape

Opener bids their |cp|red|at| ^*bsingleton suit ^*n|cp||at| (as in Oliver's Twist)  ie: they bid the CHEAPEST suit that they would NOT SUPPORT at a higher level.  (Here ALWAYS the singleton).

^f@2
Responder passes if that's their suit.

If Responder is max for their 0-4 and has a fairly self-sufficient suit for 2 losers max (eg: QJ109xxx), they might try game despite Opener hitting their suit, but never with a suit such as J87xxx. 

If Opener does NOT hit Responder's long suit, Responder corrects by bidding it at the cheapest level. Opener will usually bid game if it's a Major, since we will almost always make at least 10 tricks in these circumstances.|

at|^*bMM:  ^*n   Because the  Simple System 2@d Opening  was revised in early 2017, this lesson is taken from the Feb 2018 class given by Oliver.  
|n^|8|at|
The text given here DOES includes some examples from the previous years of the 2@d class.  Also, as Oliver now uses 'radio' voice when giving the lesson I have, in places, added sections from the many things he has said.


|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Hi Everyone and welcome to today's Precision Club session, in which we'll be taking a close look at
the 2@D Opening & Responses that we use in this system.

^fThis is  ^*bNOT^*n  even remotely a standard Precision Opening.

If you have not already done so, please have a look at the notes I have prepared on the notes on the
|n#|5|at|^cOCP 2@D opening at    ^*hhttp://ocp.pigpen.org.uk/2d.php^*n  



"Classic" Precision uses the 2@d Opening for 11-15 4441 shape hands with a  SINGLETON @d ONLY.

Devoting a bid to a single shape that only comes up one hand in a thousand is a waste of a bid, in my view, which is why I have always preferred to open such hands with 1@d  instead, which in turn frees up the 2@d Opening for something else.

For us that 'something else' is  @-  STRONG  16-23  point hands with  ANY 4441  distribution.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|The  2@D  Opening  is  16-23  hcp    ANY  4441  shape|fp||at|^^^^|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  These 16-23 any 4441  hands are ^*bNOT^*n catered for by the 1@c Opening.  Note that after a 1@c Opening, Opener's suit rebids always show 5+ card suits and the balanced responses deny having a singleton.

Some Precision pairs overcome this by allowing 4 card suits to be shown by rebids (following the 1@C opener), but I've never been comfortable with this approach and it really would change EVERYTHING else in the system (all the Asking Bids, responses etc).

Many Precision Pairs either use a Multi 2@d (with strong 4441's as one of the options), or adopt 2@d to show STRONG 4441 hands as we do.

The 2@d Opening is unconditionally forcing for one round.

It is not unheard of for Responder to pass with a 7 card or longer Diamond suit and a Yarborough, but it is anti-systemic, not to mention masterminding, and you look a bit silly when partner turns out to have 4 card Diamond support and 6@d is cold <grin>.

One thing in passing: 24+ hcp 4441 hands ARE opened with 1@c, because a range bigger than 16-23 would be really difficult to handle.

So an Opener with 24+ hcp and 4441 shape IS FORCED to rebid in a 4 card suit.  This is acceptable as they have they have the strength to handle developments.

This usually means using the DELTA Asking Bid, which we'll see in a few weeks.|

fp|t-title|at|Continuations after   2@D   -   2@H  -  ...|fp||at|^^^^|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Okay, let's have a look at the   2@d - 2@h   response in more detail

If Responder makes the 2@h relay, then Opener rebids as follows:.

^c2@d  -  2@h  -  2@s           shows 16-19 and ANY 4441 distribution.

Responder makes a further automatic relay of 2NT and now Opener bids the suit BELOW the singleton.
|n^|9|at|
All continuations are natural and "to play" except  ^*b a bid in the singleton suit ^*n  which is the  Beta Ask  eg:

^c2@d  -  2@h  -  2@s   -   2NT[where sngl?]   -   3@s[sngl @c]   -   4@c[Beta]


Opener shows  20-23
|lg|f|n^|7|at|^c@2   
2@d  -  2@h  -  2NT   ^g   20-23 hcp  ^j  4441  @c CLUB    ^n    singleton
2@d  -  2@h  -  3@c   ^g          "   ^j  4414  @d DIAMOND ^o  "
2@d  -  2@h  -  3@d   ^g          "   ^j  4144  @h HEART   ^o  "
2@d  -  2@h  -  3@h   ^g          "   ^j  1444  @s SPADE   ^o  "
|n^|3|at|^b@2
Over these 20-23 Rebids, All continuations are strictly natural except a bid in the singleton suit which is Beta.
|lg|b|n^|7|at|
Opener must remember that ^*b only a 4-3 fit may be available here^*n  and Responder has promised no values whatsoever, so even if a maximum 23 count, Opener should respect a sign-off in one of their 4 card suits by Responder.
|n^|5|at|
It might seem odd that we have no provision for Trump Asking Bids in these sequences, but bear in mind that Responder may have NO points and NO 4+ card fit for any of Opener's 4 card suits and we are already likely to be at the 3 level, so priority has to be given to giving Responder a cheap and easy exit route.|

nt|^z   @3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Continuations after   2@D   -   2@S  -  ...|fp||at|^^^^|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Responder signals that they are very weak with a long suit of their own by bidding 2@s.
|n^|5|at|
Sod's Law says that a decent percentage of the time, if not the majority of the time, this long suit will dovetail nicely with Opener's singleton, and this determines our plan from this point.  With:

^*b16-19^*n  @-  Opener simply bids 2NT and Responder now bids their long suit at the 3 level.    eg:

^d2@d   -   2@s [0-4, 6+ suit]    -    2NT [16-19]    -    3@h [6+ @h's]   -  ...

^c@2Opener will usually pass, but with 18-19 and a 4 card fit, they may bid game in a Major or invite game in a Minor, but either way continuations are 100% natural and non-forcing.


^b^*b20-23^*n  @-  Opener bids their ^*b SINGLETON^*n  eg:

^d2@d   -   2@s [0-4, 6+ suit]     -    3@d [20-23, singl @d]   -   pass|fp|s|at| [I have 6+ @d]|fp||at|

If this hits Responder's LONG SUIT they'll usually pass, but do have the option of raising to the 4 level with a 4 count and a SELF-SUFFICIENT suit (eg: QJ109xxx), bearing in mind that Opener is 20-23, so there won't be many (if any) losers outside the trump suit.

If Opener's 3 level rebid does NOT hit Responder's long suit, Responder simply bids their suit over Opener's (known singleton) bid, even if it means going to the 4 level.  eg:

^d2@d   -   2@s [0-4, 6+ suit]    -    3@s [20-23, singl @s]   -   4@h [I have 6+ @h's  |fp|s|at|that go with your 4@h's|fp||at|]       

Once again we will normally end up in game if it's a Major suit or at least inviting game if it's a Minor, but in all cases continuations are natural and non-forcing, but Responder should bear in mind that we definitely have a 10+ card trump fit and Opener is 20-23.|

Lg|c|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  As Responder is ^*b 14+ ^*n with the two suited hand, they will NORMALLY have transferred into the cheapest of their two suits, especially if even suited, but they do have the option of doing otherwise (for example, they might have a 6 card Major and a 4 card Minor).
|n^|7|at|
As before, if Responder has hit a 4 card suit Opener completes the transfer and if instead Responder has hit Opener's singleton Opener bids the next suit up.   eg:
|n^|7|at|
^d2@d   -   2NT[trf to @c]     -    3@c [I have 4 @c's]

^d2@d   -   2NT[trf to @c]     -    3@d [I have @c singleton]
|n^|7|at|
If you are NOT using Asking Bids then bidding continues naturally.  If Opener completed the transfer then Responder can start cue-bidding immediately.
|n^|7|at|
If, however, Opener bids the suit ABOVE the transfer suit, then Responder simply ^*b raises that suit or bids their 2nd suit ^*n and now Opener will start the cue-bidding.

If Opener completes the transfer, this is taken by Responder as GAMMA Ask with a 4 card minimum length.

^*bPass^*b,  ^*bDouble / Redouble^*n   or   bid accordingly.

The difference here is that Responder WILL have another chance to bid, so it's much more common 
for Opener to PASS when they have a 4 card holding in Opps' suit.

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  There is further guidance on the website when the interference comes only AFTER Opener has completed or denied the 2-way transfer.     (^*bMM:^*n  See previous page).|
lg|f|at|

I don't propose to go through that now.

You can check the website if you're interested.

In practice, it's our experience that Opps tend NOT to interfere much over the 2@d Opening.

Knowing that Opener is 16+ and suits are likely to be breaking badly is a sizeable disincentive to getting into the bidding, at least until Opener has shown where their singleton is and we have found a fit, and a=often it's then too late for Opps to come in safely.

Are there any questions on the 2@d Opening, responses and continuations ?

ht|d|at|^^|
cp||at|^*bMM:^*n|cp||at|  We all know we have to alert when playing  'proper'  bridge.

The laws of the game say that what we have to put in the alert is  ^*b our agreement with partner ^*n about that bid.

While creating these bridge movies, I have gone through and added to, or amended, many of the alerts that were in the original text.

I have changed them from being ^*b REAL ^*n alerts, that you should give to real opponents, and have replaced them with ^*b STUDY ^*n alerts.   Study alerts are only useful to students of Oliver's Precision.  Of course in many cases no changes were needed.   For example    1@c     16+ Any dist except 16-23 4441

It is particularly important that we make the alerts for  ^*b Asking bids and their responses^*n,  as clear as possible

	    ^c ^*b Study Alert ^*n           ^i ^*b Real Alert ^*n                ^o ^*b It would be great if you could add ^*n
     ^b      @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@- ^h       @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-   ^n       @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-
		^c Beta    Relay Beta ...          ^i Gen Ctrl Ask                    ^o A = 2,  K = 1 
		^c Alpha                           ^i Asking  in                      ^o Trump ...
		^c Gamma                           ^i Asking  in partners suit        ^o Trump ...
		^c Epsilon                         ^i Specific Ctrl Ask               ^o in ... 
		^c Hxx                             ^i Hxx                             ^o in ... 
		^c none  or  1st & 2nd             ^i none  or  1st & 2nd             ^o [xxx, AKx(x)]
		^c 3rd rd ctrl                     ^i 3rd rd ctrl                     ^o [xx, Qxx(x), Qx]
		
An easy mistake in reply to an Epsilon is when, say, you hold ^*b Q76 ^*n in the suit, and so give only ^*b Qxx ^*n in the alert.   THAT  IS  WRONG.  The agreement is ^*b 3rd round control ^*n and that is what should be told to the opps.   

The ^*b ethical ^*n problem with telling too much to your opps is that it disadvantages the other pairs who will play your opponents cards.|

at|      So here South must (as they did) BID 4@S if they want to play there.  They can't bid 3@S to agree the suit and assume Opener will bid on, because they won't.
|n#|5|at|North knows that South might have nothing at all and  3343  shape here, so 3@S by South would be utterly "to play".  If South wants to be in game, they must bid it.
