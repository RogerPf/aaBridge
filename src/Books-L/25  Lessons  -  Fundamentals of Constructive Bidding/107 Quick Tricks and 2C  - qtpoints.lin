cp||at|On close decisions, I use Quick Tricks to decide whether or not my hand is a bit better than Bergen hand evaluation tells me it is. Here is my methodology. There are a max of 8 quick tricks and there are 40 HCP. Therefore, on average, each 5 HCP (40 / 8) should contain 1 quick trick. Hands with above average quick trick count are better than their HCP indicate. |

If my hand contains, for example, 3 quick tricks, then it is probably worth more than 12 HCP and I will stretch on close decisions. On the other hand, if it has only 2 quick tricks, I will be conservative. This is particularly useful on slam decisions, where an abundance of Aces and Kings is particularly important.|

cp||at|The hand and the comment is a direct quote but before the final printing I had a question about the number of losers in the hand. It could be as low as 5 or as high as six if you strictly follow Bergen's instructions. So I sent him an email asking him whether I was missing something.

cp||at|That response was enough for the Movie Maker to carry on. Aside from chapter 4 of Slam Bidding Made Easier (2008) by Marty Bergen there are many other great sources to review the 2@c opening. A nice blog by Tommy Solberg, BBO nickname "tommylee" at |

cp||at| is worth reviewing. Mr. Solberg starts with the next two hands questioning opening them 2@c. Let us go through both and you decide. |
