ht|e|AT|^p@2^Z@3This presentation is based on the third lesson of a five-lesson series on "Fundamentals of Constructive Bidding" by Howard Schutzman (BBO nickname "Howard") in the BIL. You can find the original material under the "Introduction to Constructive Bidding" in the "Tutorials" section in his web site at ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge^*N. Further, he has supervised this presentation for which I am thankful.

Moreover, I would like to thank Marge DeFries (BBO nickname "mardef") for editing  these presentations.

{      Beginner Intermediate Lounge, Our Home      }
^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

The next lesson, Part 2, will discuss the more complex auctions that result when responder does not have support.

In all of these lessons, I will assume the reader uses basic hand evaluation techniques. That is, he or she uses the standard 4-3-2-1 method for counting HCP and makes small adjustments for either shortness or length. I now teach, and prefer, the more accurate Bergen methodology, but, because it is not familiar to everyone, I will not use it in these lessons.

^B@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|With support for opener's major, responder has a very simple objective -- just deciding whether or not the final contract should be game (4@H or 4@S). If you have 3 or more cards in opener's major suit, that is the suit you should play in, and it is up to you to keep the auction simple and ensure that the final contract is in that suit.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |

Recall that opener's hand falls into one of 3 categories--minimum, medium, and maximum. I will refresh your memory by repeating the material from my first lesson. However, first, let me discuss "The Law of Total Tricks."|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%55 LAW
qx|LAW,The Law of Total Tricks |ht|e|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|The Law of Total Tricks is a fairly easy and extremely important concept that every player should know. |
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


AT|

Simply put, the Law of Total Tricks states that you are safe in bidding to the level equal to the number of trumps you have. So, for example, if you have a 9-card fit, you are safe in bidding to the 3 level (9 tricks). Similarly, with a 10-card fit, you are safe in bidding to the 4 level (10 tricks). |
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


AT|

Notice that the Law does not mention high-card points. That is because, even if you go down, the contract is almost always a good sacrifice against whatever the opponents can make. The Law is very accurate and should be followed on all hands. Sometimes it goes against your intuition, but, in my experience, you should strictly follow the Law. 

Note that the Law specifies the minimum level to which you should bid. Even with an 8-card fit, if you have enough points to bid game, you should still bid game, which is a 10-trick contract.|

Next, let me repeat the hand categories from the first lesson.

Minimum               No           No           Yes

During the auction, both partners should always be thinking about whether it is still possible to bid game. For example, if your partner opens and you, as responder, have a maximum (12+) hand, you should bid game. Similarly, if you open with a maximum (18+ with traditional count and 20+ with Bergen's count) and get any response from partner, you should bid game. |

Most of the time, you should simply bid 4 of the major (even with 0 points!). This gets you where you want to go quickly, and makes it very difficult for the opponents to bid. This is very much in line with the Law of Total Tricks.|

The only exception to this rule is that you may want to proceed more methodically if, as responder, you have a medium or maximum hand with 5-card support. In that case, slam is possible so you might want to proceed more slowly. |

You definitely should not jump to 4 of the major, since, as discussed above, that is a preemptive bid that promises 5 or more trumps, no more than 9 points, and no slam interest. |

With a minimum hand, opener should bid 4 of the major. With a medium hand, opener should consider exploring for slam. If opener has a maximum hand, slam is likely, so opener should assume their side will be in slam unless he discovers that they have two probable losers. |

|cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out that if the partnership has a 9-card fit, that is significantly better than an 8-card fit, even with the same (or even slightly fewer) points.

Marty Bergen, a well-known bridge player and teacher, thought this concept was so significant that he came up with a set of bids to precisely describe your strength when you have a 9-card fit in a major. His system is known as Bergen Raises, and is very popular with many advanced bridge players. |Bergen Raises work as follows:

1. ^cAn immediate raise to 3 is a weak bid, showing 4 or 5 points at most and 4-card support. Note that this is consistent with the Law of Total Tricks because with a 9-card fit it is safe to bid to the 3 level. You can think of this bid as similar to bidding 4 with 5-card support. It preempts the opponents, making it hard for them to get to the correct contract. Opener should virtually always pass the raise to 3, unless he has a six-card suit (and hence a 10-card fit, making 4 the correct contract using the Law of Total Tricks).|

Some people reverse the meaning of 3C and 3D , such that 3C shows a stronger hand than 3D. The reason is this gives you more room to explore for game with a limit raise, as you are more likely to want to explore for game with a limit raise than the weaker raise. That treatment is known as Reverse Bergen.

^B@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||fp|2|at|With a maximum hand, bid 2NT. This is a conventional bid (Jacoby 2NT), which promises an opening hand and at least 4 trumps. You should not bid 4 of the major, since, as discussed above, that is a preemptive bid that promises 5 or more trumps and fewer than 11 points. With a minimum hand, opener should bid 4 of the major. With a medium hand, opener should consider exploring for slam. If opener has a maximum hand, slam is likely, so opener should ask for aces and bid slam if the partnership is not missing 2 Aces.|

15 years ago, 3NT was how you showed a strong raise. But these days, 2N is the way to show a strong raise with 4+ card support. Even if you don't play Jacoby 2N, you should still use 2N as the way to show a strong raise. |

If you play Bergen Raises, this hand is easier to describe. You bid 3D, showing a medium hand and 4-card support. Even if partner bids 3H, you will raise to 4H. This sequence shows a hand not quite good enough for a 2NT bid, but good enough to insist on game. It is often done with a hand like this, a medium hand with 5-card support.|

- Count the number of cards you have in support.

- When you are certain there is a fit (3+ cards support), re-evaluate your hand.

- Respond based on your hand's strength and the number of cards you have in support of the major bid.|

realrowdy: Does law apply in pre-empt situations? Say partner opens 3 heart and you hold four but not much in way of points.^*N|
PG| ***** 98 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, the Law of Total Tricks is particularly useful when partner preempts. For example, if partner opens a weak 2 and you have 3 card support, you should "further the preempt" by bidding 3 (9 tricks with a 9-card fit) even if you have few points. Similarly, with 4-card support you should bid 4.

As I explained before, you can certainly bid game with 3 (or even 2) card support with a good hand, but with a hand not worth bidding game you should raise anyway based on your number of trumps. 

Similarly, if partner opens at 3-level preempt, you should assume a 7-card suit and bid 4 with 3-card support.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|You should bid 2NT. That shows 4 or more trump and a game forcing hand. If you play Jacoby 2N, then opener has some prescribed rebids.

But, as I mentioned in the lesson, even if you choose not to play the Jacoby 2N rebids, you still should play 2N over 1 of a major shows 4+ trumps and a game forcing hand.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|When I originally wrote this lesson a number of years ago, many people used 3NT to show the strong raise. If you have the original text file, that may be what you are referring to. However, the pdf tutorial is much more up to date.

2NT is now considered the forcing raise with 4 trumps. I suggest you replace the text file with my new pdf version of the tutorial. BTW, Bergen suggests that you only bid 3N over 1 of a major with 3 card support, 13-15 HCP, and exactly 4-3-3-3 distribution. In other words, it is a very precise and rarely used bid. |

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|You are referring to Hand 3 at the top of page 6 of the tutorial. On that hand, the auction goes 1H-P-2H-P, and you hold @Sxxx @HAKJxxx @DAQx @Cx. There are various ways people play to make game tries. I prefer bidding a suit where you have some values, so that partner will place more value on cards in that suit.
Therefore, I used 3D as my game try. There are other popular methods.

Some people bid suits where they don't have values, and would bid 2S here as the game try. Others bid shortness and would bid 3C as the game try. I think my approach is the simplest, but as long as you and partner agree, the other approaches have their strengths as well. And, regardless of which game try method you use, responder bids 4H to accept the game try, 3H to reject the game try.|
