^b@2^*bdjneill:^*n  Welcome all to Standard Modern Precision

As I mentioned in the textbook ^*h http://www.bridgewithdan.com/systems/index.html ^*nclick here^*x, it's fun, effective, legal, and really going to be the standard for the future as far as precision in the States.  Most of the top pros have at least one partnership in which they play this system.   So it's nice to be able to learn a little about it.       You may even use it.

For today, North is the dealer
The two main areas I will go over today are:

1) Overview of the openings

2) 1@C - 1@D continuations

In the future weeks we will look at all other parts of the system.   To start, let's look at North (opener) hands

In precision we open ALL eleven's and many 10's.   What this does is it allows us to open more frequently than most, and put pressure on the opponents.

^*bMM:^*n None of the hands were saved, but Kerrie got me lots of screen shots to make this presentation
@h Thank you Kerrie @h    and CJ provided what was still missing !!   TEAMWORK  :)|

nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psjt6hak64dq43cjt2|at|}


|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1dp|at|}|at|^b@2

North has the typical precision suit opening:  notice it is a bit light.  

You may be wondering why 1@d, why not 1@c ? 

In 2/1 and SAYC, the convenient minor is opened
Basically, if you would open a convenient minor, always open 1@d in precision (11-15 HCP)
The 1@c is reserved for ^*bstrong^*n hands
You say "may be short" when you open 1@d
It could be 2 cards

Precision is also a 5-card major system
So you should feel right at home coming from SAYC or 2/1
If you would open 1@h or 1@s in standard, and the hand is 11-15 HCP, 
you would open it just the same in precision.


Let's look at another 1@d opening|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2


|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psaj82hjt62dq5ckq6|at|}


|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1dp|at|}|at|^b@2


North again has a 1@d opening - this time just 2 diamonds
It is a very convenient minor
But you can see how 2 or 3 cards is very similar to many people who already open a short club.
It's not that revolutionary to open a short minor.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2


|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|ps7hqj42dakjt95cjt|at|}


|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1dp|at|}|at|^b@2


This time, North also opens 1@d
But it really has diamonds!
Just like in standard, if you have a long suit, you open it.
North plans on raising a heart response, or rebidding diamonds
just like in standard.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2


|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|ps5hkq84dq93ckqjt8|at|}


|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1dp|at|}|at|^b@2


This time North's longer suit is clubs by far
However, 1@d is still the opening



1@d is a very flexible opening.
You will open it a lot!
The idea is to prepare a search for a major fit.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

You might have @d and @c

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|ps8h2daqj842caq983|at|}


|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1dp|at|}|at|^b@2


Still you open 1@d
Of course you will rebid @c later to show both minors, just like in standard|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psj6ha985dt5cakt86|at|}


|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1dp|at|}|at|^b@2

- This time North has a 1@d opening again with longer @c
But North will prepare a 1NT rebid, not clubs 
- opening @d and rebidding clubs shows more minor cards than this - 
This is a balanced hand, so it will rebid 1NT|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2


|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psjt97hkdat75caqt5|at|}


|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1dp|at|}|at|^b@2


- This time, the 1@d opening has 3 suits
Notice you would open this 1@d in 2/1 or sayc too

The main difference between a sayc 1@d and precision 1@d is that precision 1@d could be short.
But it's very similar after that.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

Let's turn to the 1M (@h/@s) openings:  (11-15 HCP)

Again, 5-card majors, just like sayc and 2/1

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psakqj64hdt2cjt653|at|}


|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1sp|at|}|at|^b@2


You would open this in sayc 1@s
Same in precision
You do not have to alert this one|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psakqj64hdt2cjt653|at|}


|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1sp|at|}|at|^b@2


- North now has a 1@h
But notice it is just 11 HCP
I'm not sure all of us would open this at all in sayc or 2/1 

But precision allows you to open ALL 11's
It's more fun :-)
The opponents have to deal with this opening rather than a Pass|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|pst8haqt65dk95cq64|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1hp|at|}|at|^b@2


North again has a normal 1@h
I'll mention this is a maximum 1@h opening
Remember that the suit openings in precision are 11-15 HCP
This range gives us some immediately useful information|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|pskqt9862hk7cak98|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp|at|}|at|^b@2


- North has another 15, but this is a powerful hand
I would upgrade this to 1@c 

You have to alert 1@c
The 1@c is a stark departure from sayc and 2/1
Notice North can have longer spades than clubs
^*bThis is because 1@c says nothing about shape at all^*n

It's totally artificial
The definition of 1@c could be said to be:
^*b"wants to be in game opposite a random 8 HCP"^*n|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

Now some hands are "in between"....

^*uBalanced 14-16^*n

These hands open 1NT
This is ^*ba full HCP lighter^*n than your sayc or 2/1 1NT (15-17)
This is necessary because the openings are lighter by a HCP
So the NT range is pulled down.
What this does mean is you open 1NT a lot more often because 14 is more common than 17.
This also puts pressure on the opponents....
1NT is very difficult to contend with|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psak7hkj7d96ckj765|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1np|at|}|at|^b@2

Here's a typical 1NT opening
You have to announce the range when you make the bid (or in real life, your partner does)
Responding is easy
You just respond like a normal NT
Stayman, transfers
Nothing different, just remember opener is a bit lighter, so you need 1 more HCP to invite, bid game, etc

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psa963ha64dt532caq|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1np|at|}|at|^b@2

Here North has just 14 but that's enough for 1NT in precision.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psat32hat97d8ckq85|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p2dp|at|}|at|^b@2


The 2@d opening in precision is like mini roman
But it's ^*balways short in diamonds^*n
This time you REALLY are short!
It must be alerted.

(But there is another shape or two you can have, that mini roman will not have)|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|pskj72hkqtd2ckt652|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p2dp|at|}|at|^b@2

Here North has 4315 shape
Not really 3 suited, but kind of.
That also opens 2@d |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psaqj6hq982ca9653|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p2dp|at|}|at|^b@2

North may even be 4405, as here.  

The range is 11-15 HCP, just like other suit precision openings.
It's kind of a gadget to handle the hands that don't work anywhere else.

Opening 2@d is : ^*b4=4=1=4    4=4=0=5    4=3=1=5     or     3=4=1=5^*n     EXACTLY
So you can see that the opening helps partner immediately place the contract
often without asking any further.


The clubs we have neglected up til now.|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

Here is how you show 6+ clubs:
In sayc and 2/1, 2@c is artificial and BIG
But in precision it's just another natural bid.  (good 10-15 HCP)  NF
Like a strong weak two.


|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psjt54hdak6cqjt742|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p2cp|at|}|at|^b@2


But it can have a side suit, like here in spades|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psa8hqtd976caq9763|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p2cp|at|}|at|^b@2

North may be balanced tho
It just shows 6+@c's, 11-15 HCP
In sayc and 2/1 you would open 1@C and rebid 2@C
But here you accelerate the description

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psakj52h6djcaqt532|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p2cp|at|}|at|^b@2

It can even have.... a FIVE card major on the side
You hope to bid the major later|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

Ok so far all the openings have been somewhat natural, with 11-15 HCP
2@d excepted.
The 2@d opening has 0 or 1 diamonds
The 2@d opening never has 2 or more diamonds

It's time for the ^*ustrong hands^*n!
These are fun to announce (they are alertable)
You get to tell the world you have a good hand.

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psq872ha73dak7ca83|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp|at|}|at|^b@2

- This is a typical 1@c opening
A big balanced hand
1NT is 14-16, remember
This is just a hair too strong|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
- Here's another:

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psaqjhk72dqj863ca2|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp|at|}|at|^b@2



diamonds are longer than clubs, but that's ok, 1@c is artificial|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psakhakj8daj74ca63|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp|at|}|at|^b@2

There's no upper limit on the 1@c
I guess 37 is the most :-)
This hand is pretty good
You would open North's hand 2@c in SAYC or 2/1
But in precision you downsize that to 1@c
You plan on jumping in NT later to show this behemoth|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

Not all strong hands open 1@c - there is one:

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psq5ha842daq8cakq4|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p2np|at|}|at|^b@2

2NT opening is 20-21      Just like in sayc or 2/1
You should feel at home here.
You can use Puppet Stayman, or regular Stayman - transfers, etc     Nothing changes|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|pskj32hada3cakt985|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp|at|}|at|^b@2

- This hand actually has clubs!
But we won't really know that until later
1@c is artificial
The plan is to rebid the clubs at some point|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psqha6542dakj9cak64|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp|at|}|at|^b@2

- Here's a random hand with a 5-card major
The 1@c can be various hand shapes
It doesn't need to have clubs at all

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psak9765hkdkj973cq|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp|at|}|at|^b@2

Here it has just 1|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psahakqjt42d9cak62|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp|at|}|at|^b@2

This hand is almost a slam in hand
But you want to start slow with 1@c
In standard you would open 2@c
Same idea, just different bid

That's the overview of the hands for opening bids.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


at|

realrowdy:  It seems to free up your bidding.
wyoming33: What if you have 5M and 5m do you then open the major? And why not the major when you had 5/6?
djneill:  Yes if you have 5M-5m you open the major (if 11-15 HCP)
Well, in precision, you take a gamble with 6-5's to always open the 6, and then catch up later in the 5

Somebody asked: - Is it HCP or distributional points?
The 11-15 is a guideline. Feel free to use your judgement with distribution, but we open ALL 11's
There is no 11 we do not open.

|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2


Redbird44:  Do you count quacks when opening light?
djneill:  Yes you count every HCP, even the quacks
Feel free to use judgement if your hand looks stinky, it probably is not worth opening.

But personally, I've opened all 11's and will continue
lots of 10's, some 9's!
Once even a 6 HCP hand but that was questionable :-)
wyoming33: We know you are aggressive Dan :)

djneill:  Well, 6-6 shape 6 HCP, I figure 6-6-6 is a special number
I would never open a 6 HCP hand unless I felt it was a freak of freaks

Precision lowers the bar though, enough to open light more often than in 2/1 or SAYC
And since the maximum is 15, partner will never take you for a monster,
so you can get away with a lot.
