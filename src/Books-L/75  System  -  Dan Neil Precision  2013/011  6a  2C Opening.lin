at|^b@2^*bdjneill:^*n  Today we will finish our look at Standard Modern Precision with the 2@c and 2@d openings

These openings are similar to some openings you may have already seen before

The 2@c opening is like a "great" weak two  in clubs

The 2@d opening is like Mini-Roman, a 3-suited hand


The real reason to have these openings is because 1@c and 1@d are used for other things 
so we need a way to show long clubs (2@c) or short @d (2@d)


The first hand I just want to show you makes it clear that 2@c is just a big cousin to the weak two
A weak two is 6-10 HCP

This is the next step up: 11-15
So partner can raise it preemptively - we will go through the responses|

lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^2c|mb|2C|at|djneill:  So the 2@c bid is pretty clear - it shows clubs!
cdt: What is the max to open 2@C?
djneill:  2@c shows 11-15 HCP with 6 or more @c's
The range is similar to that of the 1@d, 1@h, 1@s, 2@d openings

nt||sk|s|mb|p2N|an|transfer to 3@c|at|djneill:  Here, South knows that North has long clubs, so there are at least 9 cards in the fit.
The LAW says you can bid to the 3-level with 9 trumps.
So South  just transfers to 3@c - a special bid.

What would a 3@c direct raise by South  mean?  We will see later.

For that reason, a 2@h or 2@s response to 2@c is just natural, but ^*unot forcing^*n
South has a few goals|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|
First, South wants to get to game if North has 4 hearts and a good hand
Second, South wants to tell North what to lead when the opponents find spades
And third, South wants to gently preempt the opponents.

This time, North definitely does!
North has a fantastic hand for South - 9 trumps is great, and a singleton

mb|p|sk|s|mb|2H|at|djneill:  South here has 3 clubs, so it might be best to raise clubs immediately
However, if partner has a heart fit, there could be an easy game - 
and if partner does not like hearts, south can run back to clubs|

mb|p|sk|s|mb|5C|at|djneill:  South here is happy to have a club fit, but there are storm clouds on the horizon
South has just 8 HCP, so the opponents have about half the deck, and South is short in BOTH majors
Surely the opponents have a big fit somewhere, and likely a game
It's time to go nuclear:  5@c|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |

up|24|at|djneill:  So the 2@c call allowed very fast preemption.
If North opens 1@c is SAYC, East might bid 1@h, and South can't raise too high
But 2@c - 5@c is hard to handle

3@c, 3@d, and 3@h are ^*btransfers showing 6+ cards in the next suit, invite or better^*n

South has just 10 HCP, but a reasonable 7-card suit and club tolerance, so game is in the air

nt||mb|p|sk|n|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^4s|mb|4Sppp|sk||at|djneill:  North has a doubleton spade and 14 HCP, so enough to accept game.

The reason South transfers is that if South is game forcing, South can continue bidding if North 
tries to sign off in 3@s or 4@c

pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt||mb|p|sk|n|mb|3D|at|djneill:  North this time is minimum, so just bids 3@d, which South can Pass|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


nt||mb|ppp|sk||at|djneill:  South might be able to run the diamonds at 3NT, 
but for North to have everything else covered with a minimum hand is asking a lot.
Plus North could have a singleton diamond, yuck, which  makes @d running unlikely.
In this case, the active bidding might have lost E-W their heart fit.
If in SAYC or 2/1 North opens 1@c, and South bids 1@d, West has a lot of room to bid both majors.
|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


nt||at|This continues with the main theme of precision is that you can make a lot of good scores 
by making life hard for the opponents.
You don't have to be perfect yourself, as long as you can get some good scores by messing them up.
Karen10: So you can "preempt" clubs only bidding 4@c or 5@c?
djneill:  2@c - 2NT shows a preemptive 3@c raise  (  or some other things, we will see later)|

2@d is how we:   
(a) find a major fit, (b) invite game, or (c) show 5-card major game force
We can even use it to find a club slam.

The worst hands North rebids 3@c with

pg| ***** 74 ***** |


nt||mb|p|sk|n|mb|3C|at|djneill:  3@c tells partner that the hand is in the bottom third of all the hands|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


nt||sk|s|mb|ppp|at|djneill:  So South here was really truly hoping for a 4-4 major fit
But alas, North has none, and in fact, North has a bad hand.
South can envision North with 11-12 HCP, and since South has 10, there is no point to bidding game.

So opener's ^*u3@c rebid is the double-negative^*n

^*u2NT to show a max hand with something in both majors^*n 
(but no 4-card Major)|
pg| ***** 121 ***** |


nt||mb|p|sk|s|mb|5Cppp|at|djneill:  This allows South to think 
- if North has both majors stopped and 6 clubs, diamonds must not be very stopped at all
So South can gamble 5@c

- The SIX card Majors transfer at the 3-level

sk||at|djneill:  So the 2@c bid functions in multiple ways:  
It preempts the opponents, gets to a good club fit, and prepares room to find a 4-4 major fit.

It is a very effective way to show a club suit
In SAYC or 2/1, you have to start with a convenient club, and hope to show clubs later.
