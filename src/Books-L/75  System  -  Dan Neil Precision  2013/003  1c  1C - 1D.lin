^b@2^*bdjneill:^*n  I'll start on the 1@c - 1@d sequences:

The   ^*b1@d  response to  1@c^*n   shows 0-7 HCP, any distribution, just as artificial as 1@c was.

It's the ^*Bnegative.^*n

Kind of like a 2@d response to 2@c in 2/1 or SAYC.

In that respect it is very similar.

It is not "waiting", it is actually promising ^*b0-7 HCP^*n

But 1@c was forcing!

You can't Pass it, unless you have peeked at all the cards

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|ps76hqt32dkt7cj754|at|}        |cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp1d|at|}|at|




So South with 0-7 HCP responds 1@d over 1@c

North's turn...    In this situation, the system is very ^*bMAFIA^*n

^*bMA^*njors ^*bFI^*nrst ^*bA^*nlways

The majors are what bridge is all about.

If you are going to bid a light game, it's in a major, not a minor

Majors score more at matchpoints than minors

You can score higher more easily at the 2-level in a major than at the 3-level in a minor!
|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
Let's see how MAFIA works

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psaqha754d83cakt96|at|}   

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|ps76hqt32dkt7cj753|at|}    |cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp1dp1hp3h|at|}|at|^b@2



After 1@d, North has 4 hearts and 5 clubs.. According to MAFIA you always bid your major first.
Even with a longer minor, as here.     The idea is to uncover a heart fit quickly.
- Here South has a nice hand (4 trump support, a maximum for the 0-7 range, balanced)
          The system bid is 3@h

At this point, North knows there are 22-24 HCP total, with an 8 card major fit.
At IMPs, North might just take a stab
Since at IMPs, you can bid aggressive games and be rewarded handsomely
In sayc or 2/1, you might open North's hand 1NT (maybe) and you miss the major fit
That is part of the power of MAFIA
True you might open it 1@c in 2/1, but there is an advantage to opening 1NT too|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|ps65hak82daj6ckq74|at|}   |cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp1dp1np|at|}|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|pst832h765dqt97caj|at|}

In this case, North has a major...
But you might choose to rebid 1NT instead, which is 17-19 HCP
The advantage to rebidding 1NT is that you rightside the contract
Also, a 1@h rebid would be wide-range, and many shapes
1NT immediately limits the hand and distribution effectively.

^*uResponder can now bid Stayman and transfers as normal^*n

Here South has 7 HCP, North 17-19, so there are 24-26 HCP
I think South would bid Stayman and then raise to game, this time it's on a @d hook.
50% game is not too bad, and who knows, maybe the opponents will never lead spades, 
South having shown 4 spades..

So the 1@c-1@d-1NT are very easy hands to bid.
^*bYou just pretend opener has a 17-19 NT opening^*n, and bid Stayman and transfers.
This is very easy for a SAYC or 2/1 bidder to understand.|

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psj642ht9d753ck763|at|}

- This time North has a VERY strong NT

In standard you would open 2@c and rebid 2NT
Almost the same, this time you open 1@c and rebid (jump)  2NT  (22-24)
And just like in standard, you can use Jacoby transfers and Stayman.
Again, very easy to understand.
The only difference was the 1@c-1@d start.

^*bThese NT rebids are limited and non-forcing.^*n
Responder is in control.
Responder can Pass these if weak.|

nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
Here's a hand where MAFIA works like a charm:
|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psa763haq862dj8cak|at|}

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|ps8542hj4dt93cq952|at|}      |cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp1dp1hp1sp2s|at|}|at|^b@2



1@h by North is forcing. It doesn't promise the world, but it allows you to creep up on a major fit.
In SAYC or 2/1 you bid "up the line",     Same in precision.

Now that South has shown 4 spades, North can raise to 2@s
South has just 3 HCP, quacks at that
So if North has a minimum 1@c opening, about 16-18, that's just 19-21 HCP total...
Not enough for game....   So South can Pass|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
It does take some basic math skills to use precision.
We'll see later how North can show VERY strong hands
|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|pst9hak98da32caq96|at|}

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psq8762hq632d98ct3|at|}     |cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp1dp1np2cp|at|}|at|^b@2



This time South has a weak hand opposite 17-19
But you can't keep a good man down
Garbage stayman!
South found a major fit after all
South had 9 cards in the majors, the chance of a good fit was pretty good 

So again, 1@c-1@d-1NT is 17-19, not forcing, and you use stayman/transfers

Now we get more interesting|

North of course MAFIA's 1@h
As you would in sayc or 2/1, North bids first one suit, then the other.
This 2@c limits North's hand to about 20-21 HCP at the most.
South has a 6th spade so can rebid those,   or Pass 2@c
It depends whether South wants to risk tempting North to bid higher.
After 2@s North sees a big misfit, and might just want to Pass this.
It's a close 5@c but in general, bidding for 11 tricks is difficult with just 20-23 HCP
North has a lot of losing hearts to take care of, and East is sitting there with them covered.
So stopping low has its merits in a misfit.

In sayc or 2/1, North would open 1@h. South might Pass, or respond 1@s or 2@s   (if weak jump shift)
So you get to the same place regardless.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psa5h6daqj872cak76|at|}    |cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp1dp2dp3dp3sp4sp5d|at|}|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psjt963ha53dt654c3|at|}

This time, North has no major, so North is free to rebid a minor (DENYING a Major)
Again this limits North's hand, South does not have to bid again.

South has 5 of the 0-7 HCP, so pretty good...Also, South has a fit for diamonds
South has 5-7 HCP for the free call over 2@d    (2@s or 3@d)

North knows there are 23-25 HCP total     Game might be there.
So North could try bidding a stopper with  3@s    hoping to get to 3NT

South has an unbalanced hand with 5 spades and a singleton - 3NT does not look right
South can try 4@s            and North can go back to 5@d
This plays pretty well, even with the @dK offside.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

As Bergen often states, 9 trumps and a singleton you can basically write game into the scorepad.

...10 trumps here.

In standard, North might open 1@d, South respond 1@s, and North is stuck
Maybe North rebids 3@d, maybe 3@c
But it's tough for South to climb to game with such a bad hand

Precision allows North to calmly describe her hand and get to game
It adds some more wrinkles.|

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|ps952h643dt92c9643|at|}


This time North has a serious hand     South, not so much

The way North forces to game with a long minor and no major is to ^*ujump rebid^*n 

South cannot Pass this, as much as it pains her :-)
South's best shot here is to leave open the way to 3NT   (3@d waiting is an ok bid)

North can bid a stopper.
South has no stopper, so will use FAST ARRIVAL to get to 5@c

(notice East does not know about North's diamonds)|

This time North has a game forcing balanced hand.

So North shows the big GF balanced hand by ^*ujumping to 3NT^*n  (25-27)

1@c    ^d1@d
3NT = 25-27

I'm going to introduce a possible gadget you may choose to use  (the 2@h bid)

1@c   ^d1@d
2@h = "Kokish"
     ^d2@s = relay bid

nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psak8hakj6da7ckq65|at|}   |cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp1dp2hp2sp2np3dp4h|at|}|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psj7hq9753dkt2cjt7|at|}

1@C - 1@d - 2NT would be about 22- to a bad 24
This hand is probably too strong for that.
The gadget I will introduce is called Kokish    (2@h = Kokish = GF with hearts   or  BIG  NT)

This way, North gets to show the big balanced GF hand at the level of 2NT
2@h forces south to bid 2@s          as a kind of relay
and North now rebids 2NT to show the BIG BALANCED game force  (good 24-27)
South can now use Stayman and transfers as normal in SAYC and 2/1

North showed about good 24-26 HCP
South has just 7 HCP, but the 9-card fit (north's jump to 4@h) means anything is possible.

In general, with a 9 card fit and 30 HCP you can investigate slam|

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|ps873ht965dj54ck97|at|}


- Here North has a multi-dimensional hand
I would suggest treating North's hand as balanced
The singleton honor acts as a doubleton of sorts
But I would discount it a bit, so instead of 22, I would call it 21
And South can choose to bid on or not 

It could be a close game

Next we will discuss some of the MAFIA continuations
As normal, North rebids the major with a major-minor, even if the minor is longer!|
