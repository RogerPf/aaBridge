So far, it's all been 11-13 balanced, because actually, half the time or more it is!

wyoming33: Is responder aways captain?

djneill:  Right, if opener is 11-13 balanced, responder is captain

djneill:  Yes if you recall, 2@c was game forcing unless 3@c rebid immediately.
(MM..yes, but this in new situation, raising p's suit)

pg| ***** 21 ***** |


mb|p4C|at|djneill:  Now South can see that NT might be difficult with just one spade stopper.
At the same time, there may be a  club slam, with 9 trumps, anything can happen
|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt||sk|n|mb|p4D|at|djneill:  North has a great 5-card suit, and all prime cards
So North cue-bids 4@d
North can basically count a slam if there are enough keycards... but 0314 makes it difficult - 
you don't always know if you have the Queen of trumps until it is too late.

South also is not sure the @d are so solid

pg| ***** 33 ***** |


sk||at|djneill:  Once South knows North is  1@s - 4@h - 5@d - 3@c  exactly, it is not difficult to rest in 3NT
So the thing to remember for a 1@d opening is:  Opener is USUALLY 11-13 balanced

Let's see how it works when the opponents interfere over 1@d

Just remember that opener is:   you guessed it:  11-13 balanced most often
South has 16, enough for game.
But just like in SAYC, we use a NEGATIVE DOUBLE to ask about hearts

pg| ***** 39 ***** |


sk||at|djneill:  South has 16 and a well-placed @sK behind overcaller, so maybe 17 HCP
Still, North is: .... 11-13 BALANCED
So there is no reason to explore
If North had 14-15, North would be unbalanced maximum and have jumped around
If North had 12-13 unbalanced with 4 @h's, North would have tried 3@h over the double
So by bidding 2@h, North is clearly showing a MINIMUM hand

sk||at|djneill:  South has 11, but remember, Precision opens light, 
so 11 is not enough to force to game on, sometimes not even enough to invite on.
So South can Pass.

nt||mb|p|sk|n|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^p|mb|p|at|djneill:  North might want to retreat into clubs here..
The problem with retreating into clubs is that when opener bids 1@d then 2@c, it shows BOTH minors
North would be embarassed if South corrected 2@c back to 2@d with 4 diamonds :-)
Playing in a 4-2 fit is not fun.
So North just pauses and plays it here.

In SAYC, you have to be pretty darn weak, in case opener is 18+  ....
But in Precision, opener is 11-15, in fact, usually 11-13 balanced.
So "weak" is more like 6 to 10
even less if NV
