^b@2^Z@3^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|As I am sure you already know, longtime bridge teacher and author, Marty Bergen in association with Howard Schutzman, is giving monthly lessons on BBO. Those are paid lessons. However, there was  free lessons on May 13 and 14, 2010. The free lessons were as way of introducing students to their online lesson series. I attend anything free. So, I did not miss that lesson. And, I had many company--over four hundred on May 13. The topic of the free lesson was How To Sharpen Your Declarer Play.|

Also you all know me. If allowed, I like to convert anything to BBO movie presentation. That lesson was not different and what you see next is the result. However, I had to put some salt and pepper to the presentation. So, I changed things around and added a bit of surprise and humor to it. Last but not the least I tried to enhance the great lesson and keep the viewer involved. As the result you are going to get into the fray and get either approving or disapproving BBO chimes. So, sit back,  have your favorite music on, and learn while having fun.|

PG| ***** 45 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^b@2^Z@3^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Thank you Howard. In conclusion: When declaring in notrump, you don’t always have the time to set up your best suit. Don’t give up, and don't waste brain cells thinking about what contract you'd rather be in. Instead, try to find another suit. That will give you a chance  to make your contract.|

SB|S|SB|NCorrect Marty. You have four diamonds and two hearts.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


SB|N|SB|SI need three more, and with our four club honors, that should be easy--ten included.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


SB|S|SB|NHowever, here is a warning which is relevant on many deals. Please explain.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


SB|N|SB|SHands where your winners are blocked are usually harder than they appear.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


SB|S|SB|NLet us ask the students what would they do at trick one.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


SB|N|lb|*CWhich should be played from the dummy?^^HK^HK53^|cp|8|AT|^b@2^Z@3^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Clearly, I have three choices.
^CA. I can win in my hand.
^CB. I can win in dummy.
^CC. I can duck in both hands.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^b@2^Z@3^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|And the answer to the question is... not C, whatever I do, I should NOT duck the opening lead.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^b@2^Z@3^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Ducking won’t solve the dilemma as to where to win the heart. If I duck and if West finds a spade shift, I am history. E-W will win three spades, one heart and the @CA. |
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^b@2^Z@3^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|In which hand should I win the @HQ lead? Most players want to save dummy’s @HK. They think they need it to get to the @DJ after unblocking the @DAKQ. However, saving the @HK is not necessary.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^b@2^Z@3^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|I have a guaranteed entry to dummy. Because dummy has two club honors, I must win a club trick. Moreover, although it is not obvious, you do need to save the entry to my hand. Why is that? Let’s put that on hold for a moment. Once we answer the second question, the logic will be much easier to understand. For now let us assume that I win the opening lead in the dummy.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


nt||lb|*CWhich suit from the dummy will I lead at trick two? Click a card from the suit you select.^^d2^SQ32H53DJ542CKJ3^|cp|8|AT|^b@2^Z@3^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Diamonds is correct. You must unblock your three honors. On most hands containing a blocked suit, you need to unblock the suit ASAP. If you lead clubs first and the defense correctly held up, you’d be unable to cash the @DJ. So, we have determined that diamonds must precede clubs. Now, you can see why I must save your @HA. If I don’t, how will I get to my fourth club? Remember the correct defense is to win the @CA on the third round.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^b@2^Z@3^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|It’s very unusual that a player who opens 1NT would run out of entries. Regardless, I must immediately cash my diamond honors to unblock. Once I cash my diamonds, the @HA will be the only outside entry to my clubs. I must preserve it. Now let me ask the third question. Am I confident of making this hand against best defense?|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^b@2^Z@3^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|The answer is  yes. Once I win the @HK and unblock diamonds, E-W is helpless. I will then lead a low club to the @CK. It does not matter which opponent holds the @CA. Either the @CK or the @CJ must be an entry to the dummy to cash the @DJ. By saving the @HA, E-W can’t stop me from winning three club tricks. It no longer matters when West wins his @CA. Let's play the hand out.|

SB|N|SB|SYes. Occasionally, your plan will be thwarted by a bad split.|

NT||cp|8|AT|^b@2^Z@3^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|SB|n|cp||at|Thank you Howard. Whenever I see a 5-card suit, I give it a second look. Long suits are the key to making many contracts. That is even true when the long suit is weak. Another of my favorite themes is not drawing trumps prematurely. I estimate that I draw trump first only 40% of the time.|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^b@2^Z@3^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|I know that my peers would answer in a similar way. On the other hand, when I ask my students: "How often do you draw trump ASAP?" I usually get answers such as 75%, 90% etc. On this hand, it is 1000% wrong to draw even one round of trumps first. Instead, you should immediately turn your attention to dummy’s long suit. Let me take care of this trick.|

Regardless of which card West plays, I would play low from dummy. Another excellent teaching theme is: "Lose your losers early." Many players are taught that when they begin playing.

@D@D nome: Now, if you wish, you can play this hand double dummy. West led heart Queen, however, you can choose a different lead. Just click any card from that hand. When finished or if not interested in the double dummy feature please, click the forward arrow to move to the next board. |

Kerrie: My only fast losers are the @CAK. |

cp|8|AT|^b@2^Z@3^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Correct, as long as you can trump your two small hearts, you are willing to lose a trick to the @SQ. The one thing you can’t risk is an opponent over-ruffing you with the @SQ and leading a trump. This applies to both hearts and diamonds. Having done your planning, you’re ready to play.|
