As requested by a few of his students, in September, 2012 Howard explained the Dummy Reversal in one of his two weekly mentoring sessions. The lesson was great and along with other students I understood it well-I thought. You will get to see his explanation shortly. But, uncommon as Dummy Reversal may be, soon after the lesson I declared two boards with bad results. Had I learned the lesson well I could recognize the obvious, Dummy Reversal, and make both contracts. This presentation is my attempt to fully learn the issue and hope to recognize the Dummy Reversal when I confront it next time at a bridge table.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT| 

To prepare it I searched the web, collected the best information on the topic, run them by Howard for his comments, and finally arranged them in how I like to learn it. In doing so I will be presenting the topic in a different format than Howard's lesson on September 12, 2012. The format is simple. Howard tries to answer questions in a way that might help it burn on Movie Maker's mind. |

^B@2^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|It is difficult to find a clear definition for "Dummy Reversal" in the bridge literature. The following from Wikipedia seems more to my liking. |
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


AT|

"Dummy reversal (also known as reverse dummy) is a technique in contract bridge whereby declarer uses trump cards to ruff from the hand with longer trumps, and retains the trumps in the other hand to draw the opponents' remaining trumps. This technique can be adapted for use in other trick-taking games.
 
In the ^*Bnormal^*n technique, the ruffs are taken from the hand with shorter trumps, retaining trumps in longer hand for control. Since player which first mentions the trump suit in the bidding becomes the declarer, typically the hand with long trumps will be declarer's one – thus the name ^*Breverse dummy^*n, as the normal roles of dummy's and declarer's trumps are reversed."|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|I agree with the definition. However, there is some misconception about what the term means. Some people think it means you are reversing dummy any time you set up dummy. I don't really care what you call that, so long as you understand what it means to set up dummy. A dummy reversal is when you set up dummy and dummy is shorter in trumps. That happens rarely, but it does happen. And you need to understand how to count trump tricks to understand when it is right to do a dummy reversal. |
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Further, when most people play a hand, the approach they usually take is to "set up their hand." That means they look at their own hand and figure out how to generate winners and throw off their losers. That is often the correct way to play the hand but not always.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


cp|1|AT|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|The part in Wikipedia also says the fallowing:
"The sole purpose of dummy reversal is to yield more tricks than the normal technique.
 
Some indicators that a hand may lend itself to dummy reversal are:

- shortness (singleton or void) in declarer's hand with length in the same suit in dummy
- loser(s) in declarer's hand that cannot be ruffed or discarded on a side suit.
- adequate trump strength and length in dummy (typically a three or four card trump suit with at least two honors for drawing the final trumps) 
- entries to dummy outside of the trump suit"|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


NT||
cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|One thing to keep in mind is that usually, especially in a suit, declarer is the one with long trumps but not always. For example, if you open 1NT and pard transfers then you end up as declarer with shorter trump than dummy. In that case, it often is right to set up dummy, because, although by the rules you are declarer, logically, it makes more sense to think of the hand with long trumps as "declarer" and try to set up dummy.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


cp|1|AT|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|Are there other situations?|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Another common situation is when you have a 4-4 fit. There neither hand is longer in trumps. So sometimes it pays to set up declarer's hand, other times it makes more sense to set up dummy. 

One final situation, is if partner makes a 2 suited overcall, showing 5/5. You are being asked to choose one of the overcaller's suits. In that case you might have as little as 2 or 3 trump so you end up as "declarer" but logically pard is declarer because they are the one with long trumps. So it usually pays to set up the hand with long trump.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


cp|1|AT|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|So far so good. But what is the difference between having the trumps spread even or uneven in both declarer and dummy's hand?|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|That is the main point. Dummy Reversals are hard to grasp until you are comfortable with how to count trump winners. Let me explain it. |
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


AT|

- The way to think about it is to designate one of the hands the ^*bmaster hand^*N. In the master hand, you count your trump tricks based on length. So, if the master hand has a 5-card suit and you have no missing trump honors, the master hand will generate 5 trump tricks. If, for example, you are missing the trump ace and no other high cards, then the master hand will take 4 trump tricks. In other words, the master hand takes the same ## of tricks as you would playing NT.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


AT|

- The way to generate additional trump tricks is to ruff in the non-master hand. So if you ruff once, you get one extra trump trick. If you ruff twice, you get 2 extra trump tricks. Usually, the master hand is the hand with longer trumps. But you can make the hand with shorter trumps the master hand. You still use the same procedure to count trump tricks -- you count the ## of tricks based on length in the master hand, plus the ## of ruffs in the non-master hand.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT||
cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Almost always, you maximize your ## of trump tricks by having the long hand be the master hand. But every once in a while, you generate more trump tricks by designating the shorter hand as the master hand. Therefore, you can think of a dummy reversal as when you designate the hand with shorter trump as the master hand.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


cp|1|AT|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|Let us pick up your illustration from the recent lesson. First you start with a standard hand where declarer has long trumps.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding is not important. This is a normal hand, where declarer has the long trump suit. |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


pc|CK|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Let us count winners. 5 spade tricks, 2 heart tricks, 1 club trick  for 8 tricks. We need 2 more tricks. Some people incorrectly think if I ruff hearts in my hand I am creating extra trump tricks. That is not correct. South has 5 spade tricks whether he plays 5 rounds of spades or ruffs some hearts. There is no difference between ruffing a heart or leading a spade and once dummy is out, throwing a heart.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|The point is South has 5 spade tricks period. The way you normally create extra trump tricks is to ruff in the short hand. On this hand I can take 7 spade tricks, if I ruff two diamonds in dummy-the 5 spades in my hand plus 2 ruffs in dummy. And that is how I get to 10 tricks. Let us play the hand.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|To summarize, I always had 5 spade tricks in my hand. Where I got the extra tricks was ruffing twice in the other hand. That allowed me to play a spade trick without using one of my 5 spade tricks.|

It is a "dummy reversal." If I ruff 4 spades in the South hand that gives me 8 tricks with and North 4 trump tricks.

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|By ruffing 4 times in South, I turned South's trump length from 5 trumps down to one trump meaning North had the length. So North had 4 trump tricks by length, and South had 4 trump tricks by ruffing = 8 trump tricks.
That is a "dummy reversal." I reversed the (very) usual procedure of creating trump tricks by ruffing in the long hand.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||
cp|1|AT|
^B@2^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|Let me bring my observations to your attention one by one. 1. Probably the contract can be made by ruffing diamonds in dummy. Would that work to take 12 tricks here?|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Yes it would. And it might even be a better way to play the hand. However, at the time I decided to play it dummy reversal as it would be more interesting :). Also trump lead would probably make it not possible to do a dummy reversal. What else have you noticed?|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||
cp|1|AT|
^B@2^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|2. You have commanding solid trump suit with a 3-1 distribution in opponent's hands, dummy has a useless 4-card suit, declarer has a void in that useless suit, and there is no problem with transportation. A change in any of those could upset the dummy reversal play.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Those are all valid observations. In every hand you declare, the supreme rule is right after the opening lead hits the table you ^*Bmust^*N count your tricks. Then make a ^*Bplan^*N to take the number of tricks required. In most auction the plan would be a simple one. However, occasionally you really need to evaluate all your options-your trick taking tools. Dummy reversal is another trick taking tool.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Ruffing and cross-ruffing, Ruffing Finesse, and Trump Coup are other tools in the same category. I know that you hardly can wait to discuss the board in Wikipedia. I would be glad to comment on it.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Playing the usual way, trying to set up declarer's hand, South has nine tricks - 5 trumps, 3 aces, and the @DK. There is no chance for 10 tricks. But, if you can find a way to take 6 trump tricks, that gives you 10 tricks. By making North the "master hand" and ruffing 3 hearts in South, you can take 6 trump tricks -- the 3 trump tricks in the North hand plus 3 ruffs by South.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|1|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|There are other important points here. The declarer should ruff each hearts with progressively higher trump card which makes an overruff impossible if the heart breaks badly. The declarer plan also based on a 3-2 trump distribution-most frequent. We can go ahead and continue with your play.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|South was confident that the opening lead was a singleton. But declarer could see a possible late spade loser, a possible diamond loser and a probable club loser. He decided that the best line was a dummy reversal, ruffing losers in the longer trump hand (here, the dummy) and drawing trumps from the shorter hand. Let us follow the play. Again you can choose your card before clicking the forward arrow-just to quiz yourself.|

"A dummy reversal is a ruffing strategy employed in suit contracts. Normally when a declarer holds a long trump suit in hand, he uses the short trump suit in dummy to ruff losers. A dummy reversal flips this concept around so that declarer's long trumps are used for ruffs, and dummy's suit is used to draw trumps."|

It’s that third ruff which reduces Declarer’s trumps to a shorter length than Dummy’s.
