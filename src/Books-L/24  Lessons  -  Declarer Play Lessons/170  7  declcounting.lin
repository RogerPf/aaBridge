^-|CP||fp||CP|8|at|^b@2^Z@3T|CP||FP||at|hanks for coming to my seventh and last declarer play lesson in 2009. This lesson is on counting. I will certainly talk about counting the defenders hand as declarer, but I will also talk about counting out declarer's hand as defender. Both are very important. In fact, I would say, if as defender you can count out declarer's hand, you will immensely improve your defense.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |

This lesson is based on two sets of materials. The first is my tutorial on counting distribution. You down load it from my web site at ^*Hwww.hondobridge.com^*N. That is where most of the material will come from. Also, for those of you who have Marty Bergen's ^*IDeclarer Play^*N book, there is some material from Chapter two. I will note where the material comes from for each hand. |

Before we get to counting in earnest, I want to discuss one fairly easy counting technique. If you learn nothing else from this lesson, I hope you will try and use this technique. The technique has to do with counting trumps and other long suits you may have as declarer. |
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


AT|

Many people try to count trumps by figuring out how many have been played. So, if they play one round, and everyone follows they say "four have been played." Then if they play another round, and say one defender doesn't follow, they think "seven have been played." But that can get very complicated, particularly if you as declarer or one of the defenders has ruffed a trick.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


AT|

A much easier way to keep track of trumps, or any long suit, is to just remember how many are out in the defenders hand. So, if you start with an 8-card fit, then there are five out in the two defensive hands. If you play one round, and both follow, then just remember there are three out. It is much easier to do it this way, as you are keeping track of fewer cards and numbers. You simply remember how many are out. Let me load an example hand to show you. |

Let's do a little planning and counting winners. You have six spades if spades break, two clubs, two diamonds, and a diamond ruff for eleven tricks. So, even if spades don't break, you will get ten tricks if you can maneuver a diamond ruff. So, let us begin.|

Now we can draw trumps and use our counting technique. Let me pause for a second here. Before we played to trick one, you should notice that you started with 8-trumps between the two hands. Six in the South hand and two in the North hand. so, right off the bat, you should think to yourself that there are five out and then you don't have to remember  that you ruffed a diamond. You already added "five trumps out" to your mental checklist at trick one. Therefore, I would remember there are five trumps out. On with drawing trumps.|

Only West followed, so there are still two out and West is getting a trump trick. The contract is safe. You have lost one trick, and you will simply lose a club and the Jack of spades.

There is only one trump out, and I can just ignore it. That's it, for counting trumps. It is much easier to do that way, than remembering how many have been played. Just remember how many are still out.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is one mistake that is very easy to make. If the defense ruffs a trick, remember to deduct one from the count of trump remaining. For example, if the defense had been able to maneuver a club ruff, then I have to remember there are now only 4 trumps out. That is the only pitfall, remembering to subtract one from the number remaining when the defense ruffs. |

^-|ht|f|CP||fp||CP|8|at|^b@2^Z@3I|CP||FP||at| hope you will now find counting out trumps much easier. The rest of the lesson is on counting out distribution.  Let me just give some general guidelines on counting out hands. Most people think this is a very complicated topic. But really, if you follow a few simple principles, it can be done by most reasonably good bridge players. It is more that you have to be willing to make the effort and be confident that you can do it. Most people lack the confidence to do it, not the talent. I hope this lesson will build up your confidence.|

There are two basic techniques that you use to count out hands. The first technique is what I call "positive inferences"--conclusions you can draw based on what bids have been made. Here are a few examples:|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


cs|6|HT|n|AT|
{|ia|o1h2c|at|}|HT|n|at|^k@2^Y@3Your partner opens one of a major. Therefore, partner has at least five cards in that major. So, you already know almost half of partner's hand. Next, he bids another suit.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


ht|r|at|^B@2
{|ia|o1h2c2d|at|}|HT|r|AT|^K@2^Y@3Now, you find out he has another 4 card suit. Therefore, you know at least nine cards in his hand, leaving only four you don't know about.|

PG| ***** 31 ***** |


HT|i|CS|6|AT|
{|ia|o3h|at|}|HT|i|at|^j@2^Y@3At the 3 level, you can assume that the preempter is showing a 7-card suit. So, you already know more than half of his hand.|

CS|6|
HT|m|AT|^B@2
{|ia|o2s|at|}|HT|m|at|^j@2^Y@3At the 2 level, you can assume a 6-card suit. Granted, these days some people open Weak-2s with 5-card suits, and 3C with a 6-card suit, so you might have to revise your assumptions later, but as a working assumption, you can assume six cards for a Weak-2 and seven cards for a 3-level preempt.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


HT|r|AT|^B@2
{|ia|o1n|at|}|HT|r|at|^j@2^Y@3Let's say someone opens 1N. You can assume, at least tentatively, that they have no six-card suit, and not more than one doubleton. Yes, these days some people open 1N with 6-3-2-2, or 5-4-2-2, but that is not normal. However, in general, you can assume no six-card suit, no singletons or void, and only one doubleton.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


HT|w|at|^B@2^Y@3It is time to make some positive inferences from the play. Let us look at an example.|

Say you are defending and declarer is drawing trump. You have three trump, and partner shows out on the second round. You now know that declarer started with nine trumps between the two hands, so by looking at dummy, you can figure out how many declarer has left. |
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


pc|HQ|NT|^B@2
Let's say, for example, that dummy started with four trumps after the opening lead. That means declarer started with five. |

This is something you should just automatically get in the habit of doing on every hand as defender. Once you make it a habit, it is very easy to do and every once in a while it will be very useful information, yet requires very little mental exertion.|

^-|ht|f|CP||fp||CP|8|at|^b@2^Z@3N|CP||FP||at|egative inferences, the second technique, are similar to the famous mystery story in which Sherlock Holmes solves the crime because the dog did not bark. You can often determine what someone has by what they did not do as opposed to by what someone did. These are harder, but just as useful. For example:|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


HT|j|CS|6|AT|
{|ia|o1d|at|}|HT|j|at|^j@2^Y@3Partner opens 1 of a minor. Virtually all of the time, you can assume partner does not have a 5-card major. Sure, maybe partner has six of the minor and a 5-card major. But that rarely happens.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


HT|n|CS|6|AT|^B@2
{|ia|o1h1n|at|}|HT|n|at|^j@2^Y@3Here is another example. You open 1H and partner bids 1NT. Partner has neither 3 hearts (would have raised to 2H) nor 4 spades (would have bid 1S). Partner has no more than two hearts, and does not have four spades. Again, just file that information away, as it may be useful later.|HT|r|at|^B@2^Y@3The only exception would be if you are playing forcing 1N and partner has a 3-card limit raise. In that case, it is possible for partner to have three hearts (but not 4 spades). You will find out on his next bid if that is the case, but provisionally you can assume he does not have 3-card heart support.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


HT|V|at|^B@2{|ia|o1c1h1n|at|}|HT|u|at|^j@2^Y@3In the example on the left, since the rebid was neither 1S nor 2H, partner has at most three spades and three hearts. Partner also has at least 4 clubs--if he/she only had three clubs, the hand must contain four diamonds, and therefore 1D would have been the opening bid. Look at all the information that can be gleaned from such a common auction!|

^-{ An Introduction to Counting Defenders Distribution }
^-|ht|f|CP||fp||CP|8|at|^b@2^Z@3A|CP||FP||at|nother play example is when partner leads the 2 of a suit against no-trump, showing four. It is unlikely partner has a 5-card suit (unless it is a suit bid by the opponents) because it is more likely he would have led his 5-card suit. I am assuming, of course, that you have not bid. So, remember, when partner leads the 2 against NT, or just the lowest visible card (for example, leads the 3 and the 2 is in dummy), you have an awful lot of information about the  hand.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


at|

The last example is when you bid or overcall a suit and partner does not lead your suit--the opening lead is a low card in another suit. Partner better have a void, otherwise he will have to stop playing with me! That is not totally true, but it is more true than not.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


AT|

It is a cardinal rule of mine that you always lead partner's suit. Sure, once in a while it doesn't work out, but it usually does, and it certainly builds up partnership trust. Remember "you never lose the postmortem by leading partner's suit."|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |

Okay, now on the next few hands, I will show you only two hands. Either you will be a defender and you need to focus on your hand and dummy, or you are declarer and I want to focus on your hand and dummy.|

You are East. Ignore the other two hands. And do not bother to open them if you know how as they are not realistic and just made up to suit our purpose here.  You can now determine South's exact distribution, believe it or not. We have a simple auction, a simple lead, yet you know an incredible amount. Let us go over it.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Since partner has 4 hearts, there are 9 remaining. As you see seven between you and dummy, declarer (South) has two. The key suit on this hand is clubs. We see four clubs--one in the dummy and three in your hand. Thus, there are nine clubs between West and South. Partner did not lead a club, so he probably does not have five and South opened 1N and should not have six clubs. Therefore, South should have five clubs.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So far, declarer is ?@S-2@H-?@D-5@C. South opened 1N and should not have more than one doubleton. Further, you know South has a doubleton heart, he can have neither a doubleton spade nor doubleton diamond. So Declarer's hand is like an open book now. South must be 3@S-2@H-3@D-5@C. So, look at what you can figure out from a simple auction and only after the opening lead.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I am not saying you should do this every hand, but it is amazing what you can figure out when you put your mind to it. Even if you only get some of the counting done, it is better than not doing it at all. That was a pretty complicated example. Most of the rest will be much simpler. On to the next hand.|

Here, I just want you to focus on the bidding and forget about the cards in each hand. I can assure you that each hand has 13 cards! I will show them to you later. For now, just analyze the auction. You can you figure out South's most likely distribution just from the bidding.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This is actually a very common auction, so it would be good for you to remember it. It doesn't matter if you play SAYC of 2 over 1. The most likely distribution for South is one spade, five hearts, four diamonds, and three clubs. How did we arrive at that conclusion? Simple. The opening bid promised five hearts, the 2D bid promised four diamonds, and the 3C bid was raising clubs. So, South probably has three clubs, because with four clubs South might have raised right away.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Again, South's hand is almost an open hand. Most likely his hand is 1@S-5@H-4@D-3@C. He could be 0@s-5@h-5@d-3@c or 0@s-5@h-4@d-4@c, but that is not nearly as likely.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Anyway, when an opponent bids two or three suits, you know an awful lot about their hand, particularly when they open one of a major. Just remember, if they open one of a major and bid another 4-card suit, you know at least 9 of their cards. That leaves only 4 cards you don't know. If one of the 2 unbid suits is led, you can usually figure out what they have in that suit. As I said earlier, this happens quite a bit. So keep it in mind that:|

In this hand, I deal with a declarer play. South (you) is the declarer, and all 4 hands are real on this example. However, we have only interested in the North and South hands. What do we know about West's hand beside having six hearts? Let us find out.|

Here, though, the key to this hand is the club suit. You need to take all four clubs to make the contract and pitch a diamond loser in your hand on the fourth club. You can play for a 3-3 break, or finesse either opponent for the Jack. What should you do? First, you must remove the last trump. I am sure you have been counting the trumps all along.|

Now, you should review what you know about West. West started with six hearts because of the weak two, one diamond, and two spades. Therefore, West must have four clubs. If you are careful, you can test to see if East has a doubleton Jack, otherwise you can finesse West for the Jack.|

Now, you have to have the courage and rely on your convictions. You know West started with 4 clubs, because you counted out the hand. So you should play the @C9.|

In this example, West's hand is of interest. Remember my rule is to lead count if you have not supported partner's suit.|

East is going to attack the weakness in dummy and will select the proper card. West hopes to know how many hearts are in South's hand. Keep track of hearts played until the crunch time.|

West believes that partner would lead the Jack from either J10x or Jx. Since West has the 10 of hearts, then East most likely started with a doubleton heart.|

West now is assured that South started with three hearts such as @HAKx and South already played the Ace and the King. Why? Because, West has five, there are three in the dummy and East most likely had two.|

West has to discard, but which one? If declarer has AKx of clubs, West has to discard a heart. If declarer has AK of clubs and a low heart, West has to discard a club. However, by keeping the count on hearts West knows that South has a small heart. Therefore, West discards the club.|

So, again, by paying attention to hearts early in the hand, you could figure out what to do and save yourself thinking at the end. Counting is particularly important on defense and this sort of thing happens a lot.|

One last hand. On this hand, the bidding is not important.

First is the planning. We have a sure heart loser. The key is to figure out which way to finesse the clubs, as we have no spade losers and no diamond losers. On this type of hand, you play all the other suits besides clubs to see what you find out about the distribution. To make it easier to see, I am going to duck the first heart, although it doesn't really matter that much.|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Again, I am going to simplify things a bit by assuming a 2-2 trump break. You can handle a 3-1, but by assuming a 2-2 it makes it easier for me to teach the hand. Next, I am going to get rid of all my red cards so I can determine the distribution of spades, hearts, and diamonds. This will allow me to figure out the club distribution. Then, I will play the person with the most clubs for the Q of clubs.|

It is not a sure thing, but it is better than nothing. Please keep track of the cards played by West.|

Now, I have all the information I need. I found out that West had two spades, four hearts, and three diamonds. Therefore West started with  four clubs, and East started with three clubs. From that information, it is slightly more probable that West has the Queen of clubs. So, I finesse West for the Queen.|

If you play this hand 100 times, West will have the Q of clubs 4/7 of the time (a little under 60%) and East 3/7 of the time. 4/7 is better than 50%, so you should play West for the Queen of clubs. All I had to do was to keep track of West's distribution in hearts, spades, and diamonds, and I could figure out clubs. I am not saying you can do it all the time, but at least give it a try on some hands.|
