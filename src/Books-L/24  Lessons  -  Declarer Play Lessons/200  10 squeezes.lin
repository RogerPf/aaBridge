^-|
 
CP||fp||ht|f|at|^c@2^Y@3Maureen Hall ( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :
^D* For beginner bridge players to escape to
^D* Where we could have teachers come and give lessons without interference from Advanced players
^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice
^D* For the beginner to go to and have one on one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions

In 2001/2/3  there was nowhere for that to happen and so in September 2003 Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began.

Nowadays there are lessons and tournaments for BIL members to take part in every day of the year. All members can apply to have a mentor if they wish to do so and every endeavor is made to find one for them.  

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project – the BIL Library was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum ( the Alfresco café), to send in articles and suggestions for publication the monthly Gazette.

HT|i|AT|^b@2^Y@3This BBO movie is based on Howard Schutzman's lesson on "Squeezes" in the Beginner Intermediate Lounge (BIL) which is brought to you in another cyberspace fireside chat format. |

On May 28, 2009, I was just cruising in the BIL and saw many players gathering in the lounge with Howard. I asked, "What's going on?" Howard said, "I intend to run a declarer play lesson on the last Thursday of each month, at least for the foreseeable future. This first lesson is on squeezes." After taking a nice and comfortable chair, I said, Do you mind if I join and ask questions?" He responded, "Not at all. Please join and fire away."|

PG| ***** 10 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Although squeezes are often considered an "expert" play, hopefully, after this lesson, you will see that actually they are not all that difficult. The potential squeezes come up all the time. If I play more than a dozen hands, I expect to see at least one or two possible squeezes, particularly since I overbid all the time anyway, and have to make up for it in the play :).|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


AT|

- |CP|1|AT|nome|CP||AT|: Okay, tell me what would I get from a "squeeze" please.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|First of all, a squeeze can only generate at most one extra trick. So, if you are in a 10 trick contract and can only see how to win 8 tricks, a squeeze will do you no good. But if you can see how to generate 9 tricks, then it is quite possible that a squeeze will yield the 10th trick.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


AT|

- |CP|1|AT|nome|CP||AT|: Well one trick is better than none. So tell us how do we "squeeze" please.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|There are basically only two principles you have to learn, and both are fairly easy to understand. The basic technique is as follows. You run all your side suit tricks, and hope that one or both of the defenders will have trouble discarding. One of their discards may set up a small card in one of your other suits. The simplest squeeze works against one opponent. That opponent has to guard two suits, and is only able to guard one suit.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


AT|

- |CP|1|AT|nome|CP||AT|: Howard, I always learn better when I see what you said in action on a bridge table.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Sure. Let us open a table and look at a few deals. The first hand demonstrates how a squeeze works. But, please note, as this is not a lesson for bidding, the auctions are shortened for all deals used in this lesson.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The first thing you do, as always, is some planning. Here, you can count 3 sure spade tricks, 2 sure heart tricks, 3 sure diamond tricks, and 4 sure club tricks for a total of 12 tricks. But, you need a 13th trick somewhere. If either spades or diamonds break 3-3, then you have your 13th trick.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT|^B@2
- |CP|1|AT|nome|CP||AT|: I really don't have to "squeeze" if the spades and diamonds are 3-3. Further, I probably can look into a finesse somewhere here.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|That is reasonable but you have to rely on 100% probability to make your 7N. The finesses are 50% and the probability for a six-card suit to break even is 40%. Neither of those odds are appealing here. But, a "squeeze" probably is your best shot at making your contract.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT|^B@2
- |CP|1|AT|nome|CP||AT|: Then, how would I proceed?|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Elementary dear nome. Spades and diamonds are your "threat" suits. True if the remaining cards are 3-3 you have no problem. You would like to guard yourself against 4-2 distributions.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


AT|
- |CP|1|AT|nome|CP||AT|: And how would I do that?|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Clubs and Hearts are your non-threat suits. So, you run all your heart and club tricks first, and hope that one defender will have a problem discarding.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


AT|
- |CP|1|AT|nome|CP||AT|: I like to call my Club tricks as "depleter" as it depletes opponent's cards.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|In fact, that is what is going to happen, as you will see. So, take the opening lead and proceed. All you have to watch for is a spade or diamond discard from one of the opponents.|

And East has to also keep 4 diamonds, preventing north from running 4 diamonds. By the rules of bridge, East has to play something, so he can't keep both 4 spades and 4 diamonds. You can now take the last seven tricks, 4 spades and 3 diamonds.|

- BILFriend1: Would the squeeze have worked if West had the stops?|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, the squeeze works as long as the same person has both 4 spades and 4 diamonds. It could be East, it could be West, it doesn't matter. However, as we will see later, that is not always true. Sometimes only one person can be squeezed.|

PG| ***** 43 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|That was the first principle of squeezes. you run all your non-threat suit tricks, hoping that one defender has a discarding problem. The next hand will illustrate the second and final principle.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|This is almost the same as last hand, except that you have one less heart trick, and the auction is  one trick lower. The second principle is that you must lose all the tricks you intend to lose early, before running your tricks. For those of you who want to be bridge nerds and impress your friends, lol, this principle is referred to as "rectifying the count." You don't need to remember the name, just remember the principle.|

stefsched: So other options, such as finesses have better odds of working?|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Good question Ste. It is hard to calculate the odds sometimes, but a finesse is 50%. On this last hand, I would say the squeeze is a better option, even if a finesse is possible.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Squeeze works if either suit is 3-3. That is over 50% right there. Odds of one suit breaking 3-3 are 40%. And if that suit doesn't break 3-3 (60%), then the odds of the other suit breaking 3-3 are 40% of the remaining 60% odds, which is 24%, for a total of 64%.|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|If you didn't understand the math, don't worry. Just remember the odds of one of two suits breaking 3-3 is about 2 out of 3. In addition, you add the squeeze possibilities, which is another 18% or so (again don't worry about the math). So, on this hand, the squeeze/3-3 break is much better than a finesse.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|In general, I would say, that a squeeze vs a finesse is at least the same odds, and squeezes are much more fun :). However, if the squeeze doesn't work and the finesse does, you might have to find a new partner, lol.|

PG| ***** 81 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|You should look for hands where you are one trick short, but you can set up a low card in one of two suits for your extra trick. Let us say for example, that clubs and diamonds were your threat suits  and say you had 3 clubs in your hand and 2 on the board. And you had 3 diamonds on the board, and 2 diamonds in your hand. In that case, you might set up a club in your hand or a diamond on the board.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's talk about a "pseudo squeeze", which also occurs a lot. A pseudo squeeze is where the squeeze actually doesn't work, but the defenders misdiscard anyway. Because, often it is hard for a defender to tell what to discard and sometimes you can pull off a squeeze even though it should not have worked. The next hand is and example. It is similar to this hand.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|The reason the squeeze worked here is because of what is known as "distributed threats." Even though this was similar to the last hand, where the squeeze did not work, there is one important difference. The threat cards are "distributed." The low club threat is in my hand, allowing me to pitch a club from dummy and keep the spade.|
PG| ***** 184 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|The spade threat is on the board. Hence the threats are in 2 different hands. When the threats are in 2 different hands, the squeeze works on either defender.|
PG| ***** 185 ***** |


UP|44|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|When the threats are in the same hand, as on the previous board, the squeeze only works on the person who discards before the hand with the threat cards. To summarize it, if each hand has one threat, then you can squeeze either person. But, if only one hand has both threats, you can only squeeze the person in front of the threats (on the last hand, West, who was in front of North).|

A "double squeeze" uses the same principles as a simple squeeze, but in this case, you squeeze both opponents simultaneously. The way you do that is you have 3 threat suits. Each opponent can only guard one threat suit, therefore, one threat suit remains unguarded. The principle is identical. The defender cannot protect two suits.|

The contract is 3N and the opening lead is two of clubs--you can play this hand double dummy afterward. First, make your plan before clicking the forward arrow and before each trick for the rest of the play. As the hand is being played watch for the squeezes' basic. There would be ^*BNo^*N commentary with the plays. |
