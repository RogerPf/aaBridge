^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|The following hand is from Howard's mentoring session on Feb 22, 2011. Last week I presented it in part to promote my current report on "eight ever nine never" and the "Restricted Choice" topics. First, let me present the board as it was played that night. As I mentioned the auction was a good one. Those of us who were kibbing and could see the four hands had no doubt that Vered--who is considered a talented player--could make the contract until the trick number 4 when she finessed the ten which lost to Jack held by East. |
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


at|

We all could sense Vered's frustration. Meanwhile, a few kibs who were short on control publicly chatted, "eight ever nine never."  Howard was the good partner and the great mentor and at the end of the play made his points. So, let us go through the board again. I will give you the pleasure of choosing your play at the critical trick. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Vered actually made the right play. Let me explain why once Eddy shows a spade honor, Vered should finesse Nada for the other honor. That is known as "The Principle of Restricted Choice." The math is rather complicated, but it works as follows. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you have a 9-card fit, missing the Queen and the Jack and say you play the Ace (or King) and the Queen or Jack drops as in this case. The odds are two to one in favor of the finesse as Vered did here. So, Vered should play Nada for the other honor (Jack) once Eddy drops the Queen. It happens to lose here (2:1 is not equal to 100%), but it is the odds on play--once the Q or J drops.|

^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at| As usual I should make it clear that this tutorial is solely for my learning. To prepare it I have used several sources--listed on the opening page. Howard kindly has guided me through out its preparation. No, I did not ask permission to use the material from those sources as almost all are in Wikipedia.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


at|

There are several explanations for the principle of restricted choice. Most notables are by Terence Reese and by Andrew Robson. However, it is very difficult to find a comprehensive and all inclusive definition without going through pages of examples and probability charts. A Google Search produces couple hundred links for the item which in most part are copied from a few original sources. They all have a rather lengthy and complicated explanation starting with a set of card combinations and most lead to describing the famous TV show by Monty Hall--let us make a deal. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


AT|

Further, it is rather tedious to have a good distinction between the "Eight ever Nine never" rule and the restricted choice principle. Nevertheless, I like a few of them which I will share them here with you to develop the base for what I hope would be a short and easy to understand explanation--at least for us bridge challenged. But, first, let us look at the easy and familiar "Eight ever Nine never" rule.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


AT|

"Eight ever - Nine never" Rule deals with whether you should finesse a missing ^*BQueen^*N when you have a 8-card or when you have a 9-card fit in a suit. With just eight cards you should always finesse--eight ever; but with nine cards you should play for the drop--nine never (finesse). But actually the odds for nine cards are very close and you may prefer to finesse if there was an inference that may be working. Further please note that it usually deals with a combination of cards missing only the Queen with three or four spots. Also, the rule can be ignored when additional information from the bidding, the play if the cards from other suits, from the opening lead, or from the second play in the particular suit becomes available. And finally it is static.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


AT|

On the other hand, the restricted choice  is complex and difficult to define properly in a few paragraphs. Next, you will find several of the better ones.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |

ht|d|va|8|CS||FP||CP||AT|^B@2^Y@3"The principle of restricted choice is an idea from probability. It is related to the idea of Bayesian inference and the idea of biased information."|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


AT|

"The Principle of restricted choice is used in bridge to guide a player (usually the declarer) into finding the best line of play in certain situations."|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


AT|

"A mathematically based guideline for analyzing suit combinations. In general, the guideline states that a play of a card which may have been selected as a choice of equal plays increases the chance that the player started with a holding in which his choice was restricted.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


AT|

"Crucially, it helps play, in situations which used to be thought of as guesswork. In many of those situations the rule derived from the principle is to play for split honors. After observing one equivalent card, that is, one should continue play as if two equivalents were split between the opposing players, so that there was no choice about which one to play. Whoever played the first one doesn't have the other one."|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


AT|

"The most common example of what restricted choice principle is all about usually revolves around a combination of cards in one suit"|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


at|

"Restricted choice is based on a complex mathematical situation and comes into play based on a known information--when two touching honors or equivalent honors are missing and gaining additional information--when one of the touching honors appears on the first round of play. It gives the declarer a 2 to 1 odds to gain the maximum number of tricks possible from a suit combination."|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |

ht|d|va|8|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|Simply, restricted choice principle is appropriate when the declarer playing a card from a nine-card fit in a suit and a defender dropping one of the two ^*BMISSING touching honors^*N on the first round. Then, the declarer should play the other defender for the other missing touching honor. This is the best line of play by 2 to 1 odds. We will get to the logic behind the principle later. All we have to remember for now is:  |
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


AT|

^ba) The missing honors should be touching and 
^bb) One of them should be played by one of the defenders on the first round.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


AT|

Based on my reviewing all the explanations, the restricted choice has ALL the following properties. If one is missing so goes the restricted choice principle out the window.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


AT|

A. It usually deals with suit combinations missing at least two touching honors--Ace-King, King-Queen, Queen-Jack, or Jack-Ten. The case of missing Queen--Jack is more often and most important.

B. It is a dynamic phenomenon-requires one round of play in that suit with one of the missing honors to appear.

C. In most instances, using the restricted choice principle give the declarer a two to one odds of making the maximum number of the tricks in the 9-card suit combination. But again it is not 100 percent.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


AT|

That was the easy part. The difficult part, however, is to properly explain why and how does it work. So, let me follow my understanding and outline those properties further. In the next few examples we will look at several suit combinations to determine whether they fit the restricted choice principle requirements as I understand it.|

As I mentioned earlier, all the explanations of the restricted choice starts with a reference to "Let us Make a Deal" TV show by Monty Hall. So next, I do my best to re-create three scenarios based on the show and use it to explain the restricted choice.|

%%%%%%%page
ht|d|va|8|CS||FP||CP||AT|^B@2^Y@3You can summarize the Monty Hall's TV show to the following three scenarios if you pick curtain ##1 for example.
## 1: The prize is behind curtain 3. The only curtain that Monty Hall can open with small prize behind it is 
^ccurtain 2--his choice is RESTRICTED to curtain 2. Contestant must switch.
## 2: The prize is behind curtain 2. The only curtain that Monty Hall can open with small prize behind it is 
^ccurtain 3--his choice is RESTRICTED to curtain 3. Contestant must switch.
## 3: The prize is behind curtain 1. Monty Hall can open either curtain 2 or 3--his choice is not restricted 
^cand the contestant loses. |
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


AT|

In other words, when Monty opens either curtain 2 or 3, revealing small prize behind it, he is giving additional information and changing the odds. Now, the prize is behind the other curtain 66.6 percent of times. In bridge, the same logic is used to explain the restricted choice. Therefore, when missing two touching honors and on the first round one of the defendant plays one honor you should finesse the other for the second honor instead of playing for drop.  |
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


AT|

How could they apply the Monty Hall's TV show to contract bridge you may ask. That is a fair question and it was my question too. So, let us look at a new suit combination. In the following example declarer (South) has nine spade cards and the four missing spades are King-Queen-x-x  in the closed hands. Again, not all expert agree on this combo.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |

South plays a small spade, West plays the two or three, @SJ is played from the dummy, and East win the trick with @SK. On its return to hand, declarer plays another small spade, West follows with another small spade. Now, what should be played from the dummy? Is it better to play @SA, hoping to drop @SQ from East, or to finesse with @S10, hoping to drop @SQ from West on the third round of the suit? The odds are in favor of finesse 2 to 1. |

ht|d|va|8|CS||FP||CP||AT|
^B@2In the following example let us again look at first board played by Vered. Declarer (South) has nine spade cards and the four missing spades are Queen-Jack-x-x  in the closed hands.

Further, let us assume that the bidding and the opening lead were unrevealing and declarer (SOUTH), is on lead.  The @SQJ42 are missing. Declarer plays small to the Ace. West plays small and East plays the Queen. Declarer then returns to hand with another suit and plays another small spade. West again plays another small. What should declarer do now? Use the "Eight ever Nine never" principle and play for the drop or finesse the ten?|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


AT|

In another word, should declarer play for the defenders' original holdings to be @S42--@SQJ or @SJ42--@SQ for this hand and @S32--@SKQ or @SQ32--@SK for the hand before? Which principle should be followed? The "Eight ever Nine never" or the the Monty Hall's TV Show--restricted choice?|

Declarer should finesse is the answer. Let us explore the issue a bit more.|

Let us go back to the actual deal, where we played a small spade to the Ace, West played small, and an honor (Jack or Queen) appeared from East and it is a true card--East has not false-carded. Next, we played another spade to the dummy with West again playing small. Then, the only "lies" of interest are combinations 4, 8, and 12 (in red print and repeated below) where East holds singleton or doubleton honors--QJ. It can be seen immediately therefore, that there are twice the number of combinations where there is a singleton honor in East's hand than the doubleton QJ and 2 to 1 that East has to play a singleton honor--restricted choice.

 4.  ^c  42     ^d   -   QJ ^f  = 6.783
 8.  ^cJ42    ^d   -   Q  ^f  = 6.217
12. ^CQ42    ^d   -   J  ^f  = 6.217

Thus, you should finesse and not play for the drop. |

^B@2Let me confess that at this stage of writing my restricted choice tutorial the volume of information overwhelmed me and I even questioned whether I had to go this far. I still had pages of probability charts, suit distributions, and many examples to include in the tutorial. Then I asked, "What useful material have you learned and presented so far?" The answer was on first page of my prepared material and it was from Howard. It told me everything I needed without going through all the charts and Monty Hall TV show. So, next I will have that summation and try to close this writing shortly after.|

^B@2"By far, the main use of restricted choice is when you hold the AK10 in a suit and are missing the Q and J. And usually, it is with a 9 card fit. It works as follows:|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


AT|

a) Play the Ace (or King). If neither the Queen nor Jack drops play the King (or Ace) next and hope for the 2-2 break.

b) If the Queen or Jack appears on the first round, assume the missing honor is in the other hand (the hand which did not drop the honor) and finesse for it. If you do so, the odds of the finesse working are 2 to 1 in your favor.

The reason that play works is as follows. After the first trick (when an honor drops), the only possible distributions of the defenders cards are xx opposite QJ, Jxx opposite Q, or Qxx opposite J. So, in 2 cases out of 3, the finesse works (hence the 2 to 1 odds)."|

That was really all I have learned so far and needed to learn. You probably would ask, "Then why did you put us through all what you call a tutorial? You could have said it in one page." Fair enough. But then I would not have the job of making BBO movies! |

Further, I cannot help to bring you  an article by Larry Cohen from April 2005. I really do not need to learn more than Howard has said. But, the one example used by Larry Cohen is very much the same board Vered played in the session. Let us look at it.|

You have this combination in spades and wish not to lose any spades. Therefore, you play low toward dummy's Ace|

What next? Should you lay down the King and hope East started with QJ doubleton? Or, should you come back to the South hand in a different suit and lead a spade to dummy's 10 finessing against West (who could have started with J94)? Let us see how the finesse rates here.|wt|S|pc|s3|

The theory of restricted choice says you should finesse - don't play for the drop. Two times out of three, the honor that dropped from East will be a singleton. Only one time in three will it be from Queen-Jack doubleton.|

"Many of you will be happier if you stop reading now. Just be aware that, when missing Queen-Jack-x-x, and an honor drops on the first round, play it to be a singleton. End of story. By now, you may wish you had stopped after the first paragraph. If so, just take my word for it (or try the link). Furthermore, many theorists and bridge mathematicians say all this 'restricted' talk is hogwash. They say it is simple math: J94 or Q94 is twice as likely to have been originally dealt than 94 doubleton."|

There are only 2 cards left. Should you play for the 10 to drop (J109 tripleton on your right) or should you finesse and assume LHO started with 10732 and East with J9?|
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This is actually "double-restricted" choice. Assume East played the Jack and nine because he was dealt exactly (only) those 2 cards. If he started with J109, he could have played any two of them (J9, J10, or 109). When you see specifically the Jack and nine, presume he had to play those two. He probably does not have the 10. If he had the 10, you might have seen it. This is even more than a 2 in 3 chance when you finesse the 8 on the third round of the suit. Therefore, return to hand with another suit, hope you made that plan before, and lead low to spade eight.|
