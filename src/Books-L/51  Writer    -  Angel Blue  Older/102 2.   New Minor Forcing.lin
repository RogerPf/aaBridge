ht|b|fp|1|cp|2|at|^z1|
ht|f|fp|1|at|"New Minor Forcing" is one of the most useable conventions in modern bridge.

The main purpose of the convention is to find eight-card fit in one of the major suits after opener 1NT or 2NT rebid.

In this movie I intend to introduce the convention and to show you a set of simple-to-apply responses.

It is easy to find a major fit when each partner has four biddable cards in the same major suit. This process is simple – one 
bids the suit and the other shows support.

When opener holds five cards in a major suit and responder has three, any 5-major system allows recognizing the fit 
fast and easy.

The problem may occur when:

^b1.  Responder has five of his major and opener has only three. 
^b     In this case, after a No Trump bid by opener, responder may not rebid the suit with less than six cards. 
^b     As a consequence, the partnership will miss the 5-3 fit.

^b2. Opener has four hearts but he cannot introduce them after responder's 1@S due to a lack of strength for a reverse 
^b    bid. In this case, after a 1NT rebid by opener, if responder has also four hearts and 11-12 points, a 2@H rebid may 
^b    conceal his real strength while a rebid of 3@H is considered as a game-force. As a consequence, the partnership 
^b    will miss the 4-4 fit in those cases where responder has also four hearts.

^b3. Responder holds five hearts four spades and is unable to rebid his spades due to a lack of a sufficient strength for 
^b    a game-forcing reverse in the higher-ranking major.|

ht|f|fp|1|cp|2|at|The New Minor Forcing  convention intends to solve these problems: responder can bid the minor that has not 
previously been bid in order to ask opener about his majors holding. This bid is artificial and indicates nothing 
about responder's holding in the suit.|

ht|b|fp|1|cp|2|at|^z2|
ht|j|cp|2|at|^bHere we can see some examples of New Minor Forcing sequences:|

ht|k|cs|1|at|^b{|ia|1cp1hp1np!2d|at|}|

ht|k|cs|1|at|^m{|ia|1dp1hp1np!2c|at|}|

ht|q|cs|1|at|^b{|ia|1cp1sp1np!2d|at|}|

ht|q|cs|1|at|^m{|ia|1dp1sp1np!2c|at|}|

ht|v|at|Notice that in all of the above cases, opener's first bid was one of a suit and his rebid was 1NT, which usually 
describes a balanced 12-14 point hand. Responder's first bid was always one of a major.

Responder's second bid – 2@C or 2@D – aims to allow opener to give additional information about his holding in 
the majors.|

ht|b|fp|1|cp|2|at|^z3|

ht|f|cp|2|at|It is up to partnership agreement on whether to use the convention:

^b1. After opener's 2NT rebid, in which case the following sequences would be employed:|
ht|i|cs|1|at|^b{|ia|1cp1hp2np!3d|at|}|

ht|i|cs|1|at|^m{|ia|1dp1hp2np!3c|at|}|

ht|n|cs|1|at|^b{|ia|1cp1sp2np!3d|at|}|

ht|n|cs|1|at|^m{|ia|1dp1sp2np!3c|at|}|

ht|t|cp|2|at|^b2. After opener's first bid was a major, responder rebids the minor which is the most natural to his hand:|
ht|v|cs|1|at|^b{|ia|1hp1sp1np!2d|at|}|
ht|u|cp|2|at|^l   Or:|
ht|v|cs|1|at|^m{|ia|1hp1sp1np!2c|at|}|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||
ht|b|fp|1|cp|2|at|^z4|


ht|f|cp|2|at|It is also up to partnership agreement on whether to use the convention:

^b3. After an interference by opponents.

^b 4. By a passed hand.

Two questions come up now:

1.  What kind of hands responder describes by his artificial 2@C or 2@D rebid?
2.  How should opener go about responding to responder's rebid?

^bResponder will usually hold:

^b1)  Five cards in his major suit but may also have four cards in the other major.
^b2)  Eleven points or more.

With six cards in a major suit, responder may simply rebid his suit to set it as the trump suit.

Responder who holds less than eleven points, will preferably keep the contract as low as possible by 
passing opener's 1NT rebid or rebidding his own suit at the lowest level.

What do we want to achieve with the New Minor Forcing convention?

1.  Find a 4-4 fit in the unbid major.
2.  Find a 5-3 fit in responder's major.
3.  Obtain further information about opener's strength within his minimum opening.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |

ht|b|fp|1|cp|2|at|^z5|
ht|f|cp|2|cs|1|at|PRIORITIES:

1.    After  {1@C - 1@H, 1NT - 2@d}  or  {1@D - 1@H, 1NT - 2@C}:

^ba.  Opener shows heart support with three hearts.
^bb.  Opener bids No Trump.


2.    After  {1@C - 1@s, 1NT - 2@d}  or  {1@D - 1@S, 1NT - 2@C}:

^ba.  Opener bids 4-card heart suit.
^bb.  Opener shows spade support with three spades.
^bc.  With none of the above, opener bids No Trump.

By following these rules, the partnership will most likely end up declaring the hand from the 
stronger side and will help them to find the 4-4 fit, if there is one, rather than a possible 5-3 fit. 

Playing a 4-4 fit often provides more tricks by establishing responder's 5-card second suit.

For this reason, when both a 4-4 fit and 5-3 fit are available, the 4-4 fit is usually preferred.|

ht|f|fp|1|cp|2|at|We have to distinct between two cases:

Case one: RESPONDER'S FIRST BID WAS 1@H. 

We assume that had opener held four spades, he would have mentioned the suit instead of bidding 1NT (though, opener 
may, upon agreement, bypass a four-card spades suit to rebid 1NT).  Therefore, in the following sequences, responder 
is looking only for a 5-3 in heart rather than for a 4-4 fit in spades.|

ht|r|cs|1|at|^p{|ih|psakhqjt95dg62ca943|at|}|

ht|x|cp|2|at|Holding the left hand, responder can't be sure whether the partnership has sufficient strength for game.| 

ht|z|cp|2|at|Holding the right hand, responder knows that the partnership has an adequate strength for game but he 
still can't be sure whether the final contract should be 4@H or 3NT.|

nt||fp|1|
ht|b|fp|1|cp|2|at|^z8|

ht|f|cp|2|at|Case two: RESPONDER'S FIRST BID WAS 1@s. 

This situation is a bit more complicated. That is because responder may show interest not only in 5-3 spade fit but in 
a 4-4 fit in hearts as well.

Now opener has six different responses (compared to the four he has after responder's 1@H bid).
 
^bHere is the basic sequence we are going now to deal with, following with two different hands for responder:|

ht|b|fp|1|cp|2|at|^z12|
ht|f|fp|1|cp|2|at|So far I introduced the basic principles of the convention.

Now i am going to show some more useful ways to handle typical hands.

Look at the following hand:|


ht|k|cs|1|at|^n{|ih|psA763hK2dA5cAQ962|at|}|
ht|l|cs|1|at|^b{|ia|1cp1sp1Np?|at|}|

ht|r|fp|1|cp|2|at|^bEast has 17 HCP together with a very good support for West's clubs.

^bWest describes a 12-14 point hand without spade support. 

^bIs there a chance for slam? 

^bThere is not enough for 6NT, which demands about 33 HCP, but 6@C might be a good spot.|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt||
ht|b|fp|1|cp|2|at|^z13|

ht|e|fp|1|cs|1|at|^o{|ih|psA763hK2dA5cAQ962|at|}|
ht|f|cs|1|at|^c{|ia|1cp1sp1Np?|at|}|

ht|k|fp|1|cp|2|at|Many would bid 3@C, running the risk that partner will not get the proper message. Besides, 3@C could be 
considered as a limit raise and West can pass it!

4@C maybe? 4@C should be reserved for Gerber. But even as a natural bid it takes too much bidding space. 
Moreover, if West holds only three clubs, it might be correct to stop at 3NT.

So it becomes clear that East has to find a way to show the club support while maintaining a chance to explore 
for the slam.

What East needs is a way to show the club support by using a forcing bid, simultaneously asking West to give 
additional information about his holding.| 

ht|u|cs|1|at|^m{|ia|1cp1sp1Np!2dp|at|}|
ht|u|fp|1|cp|2|at|The New Minor Forcing convention provides the tool:|
ht|z|fp|1|cp|2|at|After every response from West, East would be able to bid 3@C (or 4@C in case that West jumps).|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt||
ht|b|fp|1|cp|2|at|^z14|

ht|f|fp|1|cp|2|at|Following the above example, here is the rule: New Minor Forcing followed by support for opener's first suit should be considered as a descriptive game forcing bid and slam invitation.| 

ht|h|fp|1|cp|2|at|Here is one more example to illustrate the idea:|

ht|k|cs|1|at|^j{|ih|hsAJ3h83dAQJ97cT32|at|}^x{|ih|hsK4hAK952dKT85cA6|at|}|
ht|h|cs|1|at|^m{|ia|1dp1hp1Np!2cp2np3dp3sp4Np5sp6dppp|at|}|
ht|p|fp|1|cp|2|at|2@C: New Minor Forcing, asking for three hearts.

2NT: Minimum, no three hearts.

3@D: Diamond support, game force, slam invitation.

3@S: Cue bid. After East's 3@D bid, West reevaluates his hand due to 
his strong 5-card suit and his controls and makes a move towards slam.

4NT: Roman keycard. 4@C was also available as a cue bid.

5@S: Two keycards and the @DQ.

The final 6@D contract is excellent. Notice that 6NT fails after a club lead.|

ht|b|fp|1|cp|2|at|^z15|

ht|f|fp|1|cp|2|at|Another application of the New Minor Forcing convention can be used after opener's 2NT rebid.

In this context we should first refer to another question that appears frequently.

Look at the following hand:|
ht|k|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psAJ42hK5dAK6cAt94|at|}|
ht|l|cs|1|at|^j{|ia|1cp1hp?|at|}|
ht|r|fp|1|cp|2|at|^bThe question is: should West show a balanced 18-19 point hand by jumping to 2NT or 
^bshould he content with 1@S and show his strength later?

^bThough in my opinion 1@S will usually provide better results, many will give priority to 2NT.|
