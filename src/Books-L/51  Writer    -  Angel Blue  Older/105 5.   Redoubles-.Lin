ht|f|fp|1|cs|1|cp|2|at|^b{PART ONE}|

ht|h|fp|1|cp|2|at|Do you know all you need to know about this strange animal named Redouble?

If your answer is "no", just keep reading. If you think inversely, well… you can't be damaged by reading it also.

The historical usage of redouble in modern bridge was for penalty purposes – a try to enlarge the score by the 
side that bought the contract and was doubled by the opponents. 

It was, in a sense: "If you think that I can't make my contract, I will show you what I think about that by redoubling your double".

About 60-70 years ago, a new idea has been originated: instead of ^*B "I can make my bid" ^*Nit was converted into: 
^*B"I believe I can defeat you whatever contract you may bid".|
^*N
ht|r|fp|1|cp|2|at|^pHere is the basic form of redoubling:|

ht|s|cs|1|at|^o{|ia|   1sx!r|at|}|

ht|x|fp|1|cp|2|at|^pWhat does North show by this bid? 

North shows a hand worth at least 10-11 points, usually denies support for opener's major, ^*Balways ^*Ndenies four-card support.|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


nt||

ht|f|fp|1|cp|2|at|Why? 

This is simply because:

1. When you redouble to show the intention to eventually double every contract the opponents may bid, it would be 
    unreasonable for you to have a good support for your partner's suit. That is since having that support will leave 
    you with an insufficient number of cards in the other suits for doubling the opponents' contract.  

2. Having support for partner's suit may make the redouble much less profitable, or not at all, because your 
    partnership may have a game.

3. When you have a fit in a major suit, especially when it is a nine-card fit, there is a very good chance for the 
    opponents to have a good fit in the other major. In those cases redoubling may prove to be a waste of time 
    as it may give the opponents the opportunity to find out if they have a heart fit. Facing such a fit would make a 
    punishment impossible in most cases. Show support with support!

One more important note, easy to forget: the redouble always promises a second bid. 

Therefore, the opener (South in our example) may pass a possible bid by East, leaving the redoubler with the option to double every bid made by East.

Do you always have to redouble with 10+ points and with no support for partner's suit?

The answer is no! 

The redouble has a particular meaning and when your hand does not meet the requirements, you should look for alternatives.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||
ht|f|fp|1|cp|2|at|You should always remember that one-level bida over Take out double are 100% forcing. 

^bTherefore, when you hold...|ht|h|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|phsKQJT65h5dK763CA4|at|}|

ht|h|fp|1|cp|2|at|^j    and the auction goes this way,,,|
ht|i|cs|1|at|^j{|ia|   1cx?|at|}|
ht|o|fp|1|cp|2|at|it would be incorrect to redouble because it may give the opponents to learn whether they have a heart fit and 
how good is that fit. You should instead bid 1@S  which may be sufficient to shut East up if he has a weak hand.|

ht|q|fp|1|cp|2|at|There are also other kinds of hands in which a redouble is not recommended. 

Look at this hand (same auction as above):|
ht|r|cs|1|at|^k{|ih|ps97hak865daqt94c8|at|}|
ht|x|fp|1|cp|2|at|Having two long suits, you need time and bidding space to show them both. Redoubling may cause a loss of expensive time. 

If you redouble instead of bidding a suit, the opponents would be able to outbid you by a simple bid or by 
a weak jump. You may then lose your opportunity to show both of your suits. Bid 1@H and jump to 3@D later.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||
ht|f|fp|1|cp|2|at|A very important point: A two-level bid over an opponent's double is not forcing. 
Therefore, when you have 10 points together with a suit that has to be shown at the 
two level, you must redouble first.

^bLook at the following examples:|
ht|j|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psA87h43d87ckjt743|at|}|
ht|k|cs|1|at|^j{|ia|   1hx?|at|}|
ht|p|fp|1|cp|2|at|^bWith this hand you should bid 2@C – non forcing.|

ht|r|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psAq7h43d87ckjt743|at|}|
ht|s|cs|1|at|^j{|ia|   1hx?|at|}|
ht|x|fp|1|cp|2|at|^bThis hand is too strong for a non-forcing bid. Redouble!|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||
ht|f|fp|1|cp|2|at|Showing support in a major suit:

As mentioned above, when you have a support for partner's major, you should show 
support instead of redoubling.

Most of today's players use a jump support to show a weak hand. The preempt tends to cause the opponents difficulties or even prevents them from further bidding.

But it also says that you are unable to make a jump raise with 10+ points and four card support for partner's major. How then should you show the support?

It is with a bid you don't need anymore in this kind of Auctions – the 2NT bid (with hands that naturally would bid 2NT, you now can use the redouble).|

ht|r|fp|1|cp|2|at|^bSo with this hand...|ht|s|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|pskt4hkj86dqj32c84|at|}|
ht|t|cs|1|at|^j{|ia|   1hx!2n|at|}|
ht|s|fp|1|cp|2|at|^j    You should bid 2NT to show the support.|

ht|z|fp|1|cp|2|at|^bThis is a convenetional bid, named Jordan (or Truscott) 2NT.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||
ht|f|fp|1|cp|2|at|Let's now move to East, the doubler's partner.|
ht|h|cs|1|at|{|ia|   1sx!r?|at|}|
ht|n|fp|1|cp|2|at|It is unlikely that East has much to offer in this auction, even if all the others hold minimum strength. In real life 
East is supposed to have 0-6 points, 2-4 on average.

The first option for East is to pass. This will show a hand with no comfortable bid. It can for instance be a hand with no five-card suit, neither four-card heart suit, nor good four-card minor suit.

This pass denies even the weakest possible heart suit (5432). As the doubler is assumed to have four hearts, 
East is expected to show four-card heart suit if he has one.

A jump in a suit by East should be identified as a preemptive bid – weak hand with long suit.

ht|h|fp|1|cp|2|at|So far we have explored situations in where we can redouble and others in where our hand does not meet the reuirements for the redouble and we needed to look for alternatives. We have also discussed the options for the doubler's partner.

Now we are going to put ourselves in the opener's seat, assuming his RHO (the fourth seat) has made a bid or passed.

What should the opener do in such cases?

The answer is very simple: usually nothing!

The critical point we should remember is that the redoubler has promised a second bid and therefore the opener doesn't have to bid unless he has something very important to tell. 

From the opener's viewpoint, his partner may have something like @sKQJx in the opponents' suit and he wishes to penalise them.|

ht|k|fp|1|cp|2|at|1. Pass: This is the most frequent reaction. South is usually saying: "my opening bid was not based on an 
             extreme distribution.

2. 2@d. A repeat of the opening suit describes a minimum opening which is based on a long suit without  
            great defense value.

^iIt can be something like this:|
ht|o|cs|1|at|^p{|ih|hsqxhxdkqjxxxxcqjx|at|}|
ht|s|fp|1|cp|2|at|3. 3@D. This bid does not promise the 15-17 points we would expect in other kinds of auction, that's 
            because with those hands we would certainly pass. In principle this bid shows a close or 
	         semi-close suit with not much of side value, a little bit better than a real preemptive value but yet 
	         limited in strength (usually 11-13 points). ^pFor example:|

ht|h|cs|1|at|^j{|ia|    1cd!r1spp?|at|}|
ht|n|fp|1|cp|2|at|Your redouble states that you intend to bid anyhow. Your options are to double or to bid something else.

A doulbe would of course be penalty oriented, therefore you need a four-card suit with at least one honor and 
good spot(s). @SKTxx would be the minimum requirement.

You should remember that your partner will normally not pull your double out so you must be careful. With less than required for the double you can bid 1NT or 2NT, depending on your strength.

As the redouble promises at least 10-11 points, 1NT will show minimum and 2NT will show 12+ and would be a game force, offering to play at 3NT. This bid also describes the redoubler's distribution and allows to find 
a better contract if such is exists.|
