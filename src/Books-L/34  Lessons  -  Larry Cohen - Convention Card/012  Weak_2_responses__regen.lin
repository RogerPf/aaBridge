I will give my advice on what conventions are important, and which are not. My opinions reflect 25 years of writing and teaching and are aimed at the intermediate level. This series is not for beginners and not for National Champions. Anyone in between will hopefully benefit from my thoughts.|

at|^^|cp||at|^bBTW, Howard thinks Ogust is better than feature. Ogust lets you describe both the quality of your suit and the strength of your hand. It leads to more accurate bidding when the responder to a weak-2 opener has an invitational hand. However, most players overuse 2NT. It is rare that responder wants to bid 2N. On most hands, responder should either pass or raise based on the number of cards in opener's suit.|

at|^b@2|at|^^|cp||at|^bYou must decide if this is a minimum (in which case rebid 3@s) or a non-minimum (in which case rebid 3@d to show the feature). This could depend on your preempting style (is it a maximum for YOU?). |

at|^^|cp||at|^bAlso important is position and vulnerability. For a 2nd seat Vulnerable preempt, I'd consider this a minimum and would rebid 3@s. For a dealer favorable-vulnerability preempt, I'd consider it a maximum and would rebid 3@d.|

at|^b@2|at|^^|cp||at|^bI would rebid 3NT and treat this as a "solid suit." Sure, I'd prefer to have AKQ--but I can't treat this as a minimum, and prefer not to announce a diamond feature with only Q4 doubleton.|
