at|^b@2|ht|w|cp||at|^bIn general, 2-level preempts are made with 6-card suits, 3-level preempts with 7-card suits, and 4-level preempts with 8-card suits. Note, the words "in general"--there is no rule that you have to abide by. Position is very important. When you are in 2nd seat, your preempting shouldn't be too reckless (because one of your opponents has already passed, there is a good chance the contract belongs to your side). In third seat, when your partner has already passed, you can loosen up and preempt more often.|

cp||at|When you respond to a preempt, you have to take many things into account. For example, say partner opens 2@h and you have:

at|{|ih|pSkq2Hk2Daj873Cjt2|at|}|at|^j@2|ht|c|cp||at|^j|
at|^^|cp||at|^jIf partner is a sound preemptor, and you are vulnerable (especially at team scoring or opposite a 2nd-seat preempt), you might just bid 4@h.  If partner is a "medium " preemptor, you might bid 2NT to find out if he is minimum or maximum. If he is an aggressive preemptor, you probably should pass. It is so important to know partner's style!|

cp||at|: In fourth seat, can you open with a preempt (after 3 passes)? Sure. For a 4th seat weak-two, you should have a decent six-card suit and about 10-13 HCP (with less, you would pass the hand out). A 3-level preempt in 4th seat would contain a 7-card suit. After 3 passes, I would open 3@h with something like:
