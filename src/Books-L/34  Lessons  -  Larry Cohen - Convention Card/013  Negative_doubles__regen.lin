at|^^|cp||at|^bMany years ago, after we opened the bidding and the opponents overcalled, a double was for penalty. This ineffective method was overturned when Al Roth invented what was first called Sputnik, named after the Russian satellite in the late 1950's. Now, when the opponents overcall, our responder's double is not for penalty. It is "takeout," or "negative" with the focus on the other major.|

If you are writing "through 3@s," do you mean to tell me that when the opponents overcall, say, 4@c, that you magically expect to have a trump stack and want to double 4@c for penalties? Pretty silly. I recommend Negative Double "through infinity." In fact, the higher they bid, the less likely you are ever to be dealt a penalty double. Doubles on any level should NOT show length/strength in the opponent's suit. They should all be takeout/cards.So, don't limit yourselves by marking through 2@s or 3@s.|

cp||at|I agree with Cohen in principle. However, I am slightly more precise. I like to play negative doubles through 3@s, meaning a double of an opponent's overcall through 3@s shows support for the unbid major. Starting at the 4-level doubles are "card showing" but do not promise any particular distribution. They are neither purely penalty nor purely takeout. They mean "partner, do something intelligent". The more distributional partner is the more partner should want to bid. The flatter partner is, the more partner should want to pass.|

cp||at|The "smaller" issues are the following two specific auctions, which unfortunately require memorization:|
cs|1|ht|g|cs|1|cp||at|^b{}|
at|{|ia|-1c1dx|at|}|at|^k@2|ht|g|cp||at|^kIn this exact auction, the double promises both majors (at least 4-4). With only one 4 card major, the responder simply bids it (promising at least 4).|
cs|1|ht|k|cs|1|cp||at|^b{}|
at|{|ia|-1c1hx|at|}|at|^k@2|ht|k|cp||at|^kOn this specific auction, the double promises exactly 4 spades. With 5 or more, the responder bids 1@s.|
at|^b@2|ht|o|cp||at|^bThese 2 auctions cause confusion among inexperienced players. There is no substitute or shortcut for these 2 "special" rules. They simply need to be studied, studied again, then practiced and memorized.|

at|^^|cp||at|^bWhen playing Negative Double, what if the responder happens to have a penalty double? The way to "get them" is to pass (in tempo is a good idea) and hope the opening bidder can reopen with his own takeout double, to be converted for penalties.|

cp||at|There is plenty more on this topic (such as follow-ups by opener and responder)@-but none of it needs noting on the convention card. I couldn't live without Negative Double. Everyone should play them, and they should be played on all levels (not just the 2- and 3-level). In general, the negative double shows the unbid suits, with the focus on the majors.|
