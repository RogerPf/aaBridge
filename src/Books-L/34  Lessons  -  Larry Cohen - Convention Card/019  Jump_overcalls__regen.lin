at|^b@2|ht|r|cp||at|^bWhat are the requirements for this weak jump overcall? Let's keep this easy. If you would open a weak two-bid, then you can make a jump two-level overcall. If you would open with a three-level preempt, then you can make a three-level jump overcall. Vulnerability and suit quality are key. Next, are some examples.|

cp||at|Bonus for very experienced players:|
at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bALERT:  What does it mean if you jump overcall after they have preempted?  For example in:|
cs|1|ht|e|cs|1|cp||at|^b{}|
at|{|ia|--2h3s|at|}|ht|g|cp||at|^jauction, or.|
cs|1|ht|h|cs|1|cp||at|^b{}|
at|{|ia|--2h4c|at|}|ht|i|cp||at|^jthis auction you are South with 3@s and 4@c bids.|
at|^b@2|ht|k|cp||at|^bThere is a good saying: "You can't preempt a preempt." Once your opponent has preempted, you shouldn't also be able to preempt. Therefore, the jumps in the auctions above don't show weak hands. They show good hands. How good? "Intermediate." |
at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bThis means about 16-18 in playing strength (more than a full opening bid) and a good 6+ card suit. So, on the first example, a 3@s jump overcall would look something like:|

at|^b@2|at|^^|cp||at|^b^*bMM: What Cohen calls "Roman Jump Overcalls" is also known as "Leaping Michaels" (which Howard finds more descriptive name since it shows a Michaels type 5-5 hand). Howard thinks that Leaping Michaels is a better way to play a jump to 4@c or 4@d than having it show a single suited minor hand. As Cohen suggests, this lets you play a 3-level cue bid over a weak 2 as asking for a stopper. That comes up fairly frequently and lets you get to 3NT when appropriate. The 3@h/3@s cue bid as stopper ask only applies over 2@h and 2@s openers. A 3@d cue bid over 2@d is still Michaels.^*n|
