at|^^|cp||at|^hLet's start with the jump-overcall of 2NT. This is one of the first conventions that new players learn. The "Unusual" notrump shows a 2-suited hand (at least 5-5). The two suits are the "two lowest unbid suits." So, after the opponents open 1@h or 1@s, the jump overcall of 2NT shows at least 5-5 in the minors. Over a 1@d opening, the 2NT bid shows clubs & hearts. Over a 1@c opening, it shows diamonds & hearts. What strength? Usually it is a preemptive-type hand (weak)@-but could be a very strong hand (in which case the 2NT-bidder will act again). The vulnerability is important; I'd show a 2-suiter with KJ9xx in each suit if not vulnerable, but would prefer to have better suits if vulnerable.|

at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bWhen the opponents open one-of-any-suit and we overcall 1NT, it shows a balanced hand with the strength of a strong 1NT opening. A normal range for a 1NT opening is 15-17. The overcall can be slightly stronger, possibly up to 18. On the low end, a 15-count should be a decent 15, especially if vulnerable. So, the approximate range is 15 to 18. Of course, a stopper in the opponent's suit is a good idea (especially if the opening was a major). In balancing seat, it is normal to "subtract a king" so the range is approximately 12-15.|

at|^^|cp||at|^bWhen in doubt, if it is at all conceivable to try 3NT, then close your eyes and go for it. Partner can usually be counted on for a little help. Even if he lets you down, you are unlikely to get doubled. Partner should not bury you when you make a 3NT overcall; he should assume you are already bidding some of his cards. If partner does bid, I suggest 4@c is Stayman and 4@d/4@h are transfers. There are many complex possibilities here, but why bother to memorize them when this situation doesn't come up very often? A jump overcall to 3NT is always a very good hand (roughly 20+ in playing strength)--as opposed to overcalling after a 3-level preempt, where you might have to do it under duress (with the equivalent of, say, only 16+).|

at|{|ih|pS7H2Daqj987Ckqj65|at|}|at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bIt shows at least 5-5 shape. Again there are many complexities (really, 4NT can be any 2 suits), but this article can't go on forever. What's written here is sufficient for my "summary approach."|

cp||at|In general, a 4N overcall is 5-5 in the minors (assuming the opening bid was in a major). However, there is one exception. If the opponents open 4@s, then 4N shows any 5/5 hand. The suits are not necessarily the minors; one of the suits could be hearts. Therefore, responder must take that into account when bidding. Responder should only bid 5@d over 4N if he is willing to hear partner correct to 5@h. Otherwise he should bid 5@c even if he has better diamonds.|

cp||at|Playing this as a strong NT (15-18) is fine. However, it is slightly dangerous. In general, the opponents have at least 20 HCP between them, often more. Therefore partner rates to be weak so you could easily be in trouble in 1NT. Therefore many good players play this as a "sandwich NT." It is defined as a weak takeout bid, less than an opening hand. Usually with 5 cards in the unbid minor and 4 cards in the unbid major. With a stronger hand and the 2 unbid suits, you can still make a takeout double.|
