I will give my advice on what conventions are important, and which are not. My opinions reflect 25 years of writing and teaching and are aimed at the intermediate level. This series is not for beginners and not for National Champions. Anyone in between will hopefully benefit from my thoughts.|

at|^^|cp||at|^bI am very much in the KISS (Keep It Simple Sweetheart) School. I believe that focus on declarer play and defense is much more important than adding a fancy convention. If a convention is hard to memorize I will not endorse it. If it is highly artificial, I will say NO. If it doesn't come up much, it shouldn't be in your arsenal. The only conventions I will endorse, must meet all three of these requirements:|

at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bOoops. Marty alerted. He took my bid as conventional. He was right. I had forgotten our methods. This was one of Marty's (many) brainchilds called BROmAD. Instead of showing clubs, I had shown 7-10 points and 4+ diamonds! At least I had the 7-10 points.|

at|^^|cp||at|^bI am NOT ALLOWED TO BE WOKEN UP BY MARTY'S ALERT. When I bid 2@c, I thought I was showing clubs. I must ignore the fact that he alerted and explained it as diamonds. (Even had he not explained it, I am not entitled to all of a sudden "remember".) Let me repeat: When I bid 2@c, I thought I had shown clubs. Armed with that information, my partner jumped to 5@d. Who am I to overrule him? I still have what I've shown. I showed clubs, I had clubs. Removing to 6@c would be taking advantage of the alert.|

at|^^|cp||at|^bBefore I show you a new deal with this theme, I will tell you that the above story had a remarkable ending. You can read about it in Points Schmoints, or hear the full story at one of my lectures (sorry for the tease).|
at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bNow, on to this deal from the 2007 Nationals.|
at|^^|cp||at|^b|

at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bWith neither side vulnerable, he saw a 1@d opening by David Berkowitz. This was a Precision diamond--could be short. It is important to discuss with your partner if you treat such a 1@d opening as anything special. Is 2@d still Michaels? Daniel elected to bid 2NT, unusual. This showed the 2 lowest unbid suits--clubs and hearts.|
at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bHis LHO (that would be me) doubled, penalty-oriented. Daniel's partner chose 3@d.|
at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bWhat's that? Partner didn't choose one of Daniel's 5-card suits. He must want to play in diamonds. Maybe he has 6 or 7 of them. Daniel's singleton king is actually good support. RHO doubles. Everyone passes. The lead is made and you table your dummy.|
at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bNow, as Paul Harvey would say, for the "rest of the story".|
at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bAfter Daniel's 2NT, I asked what it showed. Some players, especially over a Precision diamond, choose to use 2NT as minors (as opposed to clubs + hearts). Daniel's partner answered: "I think 2NT shows the minors."|
