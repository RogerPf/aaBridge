cp||at|Basically I think it would be fair to say Cohen pretty much thinks there is nothing wrong with opening a weak 2 with an outside 4-card major. As with many things in bridge, he might occasionally make an exception. But he would aggree that you should not let the presence of a 4-card major deter you from opening a weak 2. Be reluctant to pass any hand that has the points and suit length to open a weak 2.|
