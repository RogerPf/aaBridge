at|^^|cp||at|^bI suggest that direct seat actions show either a good hand (like an opening bid) or very good/long suits. It is too perilous to get involved with, say, king-empty fifth in one suit and queen-jack-fourth in the other. Exercise caution when vulnerable.|

I recommend: "Front of Card." In other words, if you make a penalty double and partner bids 2C, treat it as Stayman. If he pulls your double to 2D or 2H, treat is as a Jacoby transfer.

at|^^|cp||at|^aHoward disagrees with Cohen about the need for a penalty double over a weak NT. It is a common misconception that you can get a big score by trying to double them. In Howard's extensive experience with the weak NT, he very rarely gets a bad result when the opponents try to double his 1NT opener. Weak NTers are usually strong players and they have good runout schemes for escaping to 2 of a suit.|

at|^^|cp||at|^aAlthough there is no perfect system to combat the weak NT (which is one of the main reasons Howard plays it), Howard recommends you play natural overcalls and double as takeoutish showing a balanced hand whose minimum strength is near the top of the NT range. For example, if the NT range is 12-14 the doubler should have at least a good 13. That system works as well as any.|

at|^^|cp||at|^a^*b2) Comment about balancing against 1NT^*n|
at|^^|cp||at|^aIf it goes 1NT-P-P-?, Howard agrees with Cohen that you should strain to balance when you have a hand with good distribution (a 6-card suit or a hand with a singleton or void). This sounds counter intuitive, but the weaker you are, the more you should want to balance. Why? Well, the points are probably evenly spread between the 2 sides. If you have a weak hand, that means partner is likely to have a strong hand. And he is sitting behind the strong opponent, meaning your finesses are going to work. Similarly, if your partner balances and you have a strong hand, don't "hang" them by bidding on. Be content to play a 2-level contract. If the opponents let you play there, you are likely to get a good result.|

However, even if you decide to play them, Howard strongly disagrees with Cohen about what it means when you pull a penalty double. Cohen recommends you treat the penalty double as a strong NT and play "systems on" (e.g. 2C is Stayman, 2D is a heart transfer, etc.). The problem is the doubler often does not have a strong NT shape. So Howard recommends that all 2-level bids by partner of the doubler be natural and weak.|
