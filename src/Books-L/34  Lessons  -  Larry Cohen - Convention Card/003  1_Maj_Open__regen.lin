at|^^|cp||at|^bIt is a bit different with red suits. Opening 1@d and then trying to bid hearts will often lead to "reversing." For example: 1@d-1@s-2@h is a reverse showing extra values. But, in no case should you ever open 1@d with 5-5 in the reds. Start this hand 1@h, planning to jump shift in diamonds.|
