at|^b@2|ht|p|cp|8|at|^bNotes: There is confusion (rightly so) over other "reverse" auctions. For example, in this auction,|
cs|1|ht|q|cs|1|cp||at|^b{}|
at|{|ia|-1hp2cp2s|at|}|at|^k@2|ht|q|cp|8|at|^k2@s is a "reverse?", but does it show extras if playing that 2@c was already GF? There is no universal answer, but I say that in a 2/1 GF auction, there should be no such thing as "reverses" -- i.e., they don't show extras. |
cp|8|at|Also, in this auction is|
cs|1|ht|u|cs|1|cp||at|^b{}|
at|{|ia|-1sp2hp3c|at|}|at|^k@2|ht|u|cp|8|at|^k3@c a reverse? |
cp||at|Again, no consensus, but I recommend that it doesn't promise extras. There are other auctions where it is not clear if opener has reversed, nor whether he has promised extras. Also, the explanation given in this article is just a summary@-it doesn't cover all the nuances. However, it already says more than I wanted to say@-this is supposed to be a KISS (Keep it Simple&##133;) summary.|

at|^^|cp||at|^bCohen's system of the cheapest of 2N and the 4th suit as indicating that responder has a weak hand that cannot force to game is played by many. But it is flawed in my opinion because it forces responder to make an artificial bid that may get your side too high when, in fact, you want to stay low. I play what I feel is a much sounder, more natural, and easier to remember system. It is described fully in my movie on reverses|

at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^b1. The only way for responder to force to game is to bid the 4th suit (analogous to 4th suit forcing). Any other bid by responder is not game forcing. If responder does not bid the 4th suit, and opener has a hand strong enough to force to game (18+), then it is up to opener to take charge and force to game.|
