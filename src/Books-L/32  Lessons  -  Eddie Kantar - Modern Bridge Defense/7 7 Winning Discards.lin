PG| ***** 4 ***** |


ht|e|at|^B@2^Z@3Shakespeare certainly was not thinking of Bridge when he wrote the famous line that appears on this page, but oh, how well it applies!

I would not want to try to guess how many contracts have been handed over to declarer through mistakes made by defenders when discarding.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|

It is true, discarding is not always fun, especially when declarer is running a long suit and you have to find three or four discards - ouch!|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at|

But like every other situation on defense, there are basic principles you can apply, and there are many opportunities for the defenders to help each other out making informative discards.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|

Let's start by looking at how one sends messages with discards.

Discards, for the most part, discards are 'attitude' plays.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|

Basically you tell your partner whether or not you have any interest in the suit you are discarding.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3The discard of a ^*Irelatively high^*  spot card (could be th 4 from the KQ432), ^*Ishows strength;^*  

the discard of a ^*Irelatively low^*  spot card (could be the 7 from the 987) ^*ishows weakness.^* |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|

Although the aforementioned discards are exceptions (the 4 is usually discouraging, the 7 encouraging), to determine the real meaning of the discard you should look around to see whether there are any lower spot cards unaccounted for.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


at|

If all the lower cards are visible, assume partner is making a discouraging signal.

If two or three lower spot cards cannot be seen, assume a positive discard.

If one lower spot card is missing, you are on your own.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|^*i

Some players use^*  ^*Bupside-down^*  ^*Idiscards. Using this convention, the discard of a low card is encouraging and the discard of a high card, discouraging.

The rationale is that it is easier to spare a low card from the^*  AQ1032 ^*Ito get partner to lead the suit than a high one.

Also, from a worthless holding such as^*  8732, ^*Iit is not wasteful to discard a high card to discourage.^* |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Sometimes you get luck and partner makes two discards in the same suit.

A high-low discard is encouraging (a 3 followed by a 2) and a low-high discard is encouraging (a 7 followed by an 8).|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|

Of course if you do not pay attention to the size of the first discard, the second will not matter much.|

pg| ***** 31 ***** |


at| Why?|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


at|

Because partner ^*Iwill^*  notice that the @d532 are all missing and will assume the @d6 is a monster card.|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


md||nt|^B@2^Z@32) Sometimes you won't be able to afford a discard from the suit you want partner to lead at all.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


at| Why?|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


at|
One reason is that you may want to keep all of your cards in that suit (usually at notrump) to set up the suit, or not allow declarer or dummy to take an eventual trick in the suit.|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Not to worry.

There exists the possibility of making negative discards in suits you don't want partner to lead.

Negative discards carry as strong a message as positive discards.|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3In fact, negative discards at notrump are the norm, and are used frequently at suit contracts as well.|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


md||nt|^B@2^Z@3Here's a variation on that theme:|

pg| ***** 46 ***** |

How do you get a Heart shift without pounding on your chest?|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Discard a Spade!

If you want partner to continue Spades you don't discard a Spade, do you?|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3It would be nuts.

No, when you discard from the suit you have led, you are telling partner to look elswhere, otherwise you would be saving those cards for long suit tricks.|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


pc|sd|nt|^B@2^Z@3Your discard of a Spade is a form of negative discard.

Why not discard an encouraging Heart and be done with it?|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Because it is just not healthy to discard the winning trick!|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


sk||nt|^B@2^Z@3If you hang on to all four Hearts and partner reads this book and shifts to a Heart, you take ^*ifour^*  tricks and defeat the contract one trick.|

nt|^B@2^Z@3A Spade return would have given declarer three Spade tricks, three Club tricks and four Diamond tricks.

While the return of the @hK gives the defense four Heart tricks and the @dA; 3NT -1.|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


pf||bt||bg|3|nt|^B@2^Z@3You should be familiar with these basic discarding principles:|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


at|

^*BMake your spot card discard signals as clear as a bell^* |
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


at|

Don't torture partner.

If you wish to make a positive discard from the @hK9872, discard the @h9 (the higher or highest equal), not the @h8, and not the @h7.|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


at|

Discarding the @h8 ^*Idenies^*  holding the @h9.

Good partners keep these little things in mind and may go wrong in the end game, playing declarer for the @h9.|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


at|

^*BWhen discarding from an honor sequence, discard the highest card in the sequence: the one you would have led^*|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


at|


From the ^e@sJ10987, discard the @sJ; ^mfrom the @dQJ1092, discard the @dQ.
  
From the ^e@hKQJ105, discard the @hK; ^mfrom the @cAKQJ10, discard the @cA.|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


at|

The discard of an Ace tells partner he has led the wrong suit...again.|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Before discarding an honor card, you must be sure that you can afford it.

If you can it is one of the clearest of all signals.|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


at|

Knowing about the strength in the suit might resolve some of partner's discarding problems, as we will see in this layout:|

pg| ***** 74 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3You can save the day by discarding the @dQ as soon as possible.

nt|^B@2^Z@3In effect this tells partner how many cards ^*ideclarer^*  has in the suit allowing partner to take the trick with her honor card at the appropriate time (when declarer is playing her last card to the suit).|

This sounds simple, but many players seem to ignore it!|
pg| ***** 148 ***** |


at|

One drawback of using a relatively high spot card to signal (an 8, 9 or 10 for example) is that sometimes they have the potential to score a trick.

There is nothing more ignomonious that signallying with the setting trick!|
pg| ***** 149 ***** |


at|

If both a positive and a negative discard send the same message, it is far better to discard a low card in a suit you do not want partner to lead than it is to discard a high spot in a suit you do want partner to lead. ^*IRe-read this.^*|
pg| ***** 150 ***** |


at|


Against notrump in particular, you should not discard from a suit you want partner to lead, if you are hoping to set up tricks in the suit.

Conserve your length and strength, and throw away cards from a suit(s) you do not want led.|
pg| ***** 151 ***** |


at|

Throw losers, not winners!|
pg| ***** 152 ***** |


at|

The corollary to this (which has been touched upon previously) is that when you lead a suit against notrump, and later discard from it, you are saying 'No future here' to partner - a clear suggestion to switch to something else.|

pg| ***** 334 ***** |


fp||at|

The first discard in a suit shows ^*Battitude:^*  a relatively high spot card is encouraging.

Watch partner's second discard carefully to confirm the meaning of the first discard.|
pg| ***** 335 ***** |


at|

For example: a 3 followed by a 2 is encouraging, a 7 followed by an 8 is not.|
pg| ***** 336 ***** |


at|

When making ^*Itwo^*  discards in the same suit from length, the first is ^*Battitude,^*  the second ^*Bpresent count.^*  

(High from even, low from odd for present count).|
pg| ***** 337 ***** |


at|

The discard of an honor indicates the top of a perfect sequence.

It also tells partner it is not necessary to protect that suit if discarding becomes a problem.|
pg| ***** 338 ***** |


at|

At notrump, keep at least one card in any suit partner has bid if you have the semblance of an outside entry.|
pg| ***** 339 ***** |


at|

Unless there is a chance for a ruff, do not discard down to a singleton or a void in any suit if you can possibly help it.

When declarer plays that suit and sees you show out, he will know every card partner has in the suit.|
pg| ***** 340 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3When void in a suit you want partner to lead, a suit which will be giving declarer a ruff and a sluff, kake a discouraging discard in the suit partner is most likely to lead.|
pg| ***** 341 ***** |


at|

Most discards come from long suits.

If declarer knows your length from the bidding or because partner has shown out, that suit is safe to discard: declarer knows what you have.|
pg| ***** 342 ***** |


at|

In general, the weaker of the two hands makes honest discards, while the stronger may not.

If you have all the missing high-card strength, you do not have to make a general announcement since partner isn't going to get in anyway.|
pg| ***** 343 ***** |


at|

Avoid wasting potential tricks by discarding high cards.

If you feel you cannot afford to discard a high card in the suit you want led, discard a low card from a suit you don't want led.

This is particularly true at notrump, where you may need to keep length in the suit you want led.|
pg| ***** 344 ***** |


at|

If you discard in a suit partner has led earlier, make a present count discard.

(When either declarer or dummy initiates a suit, you usually give present count immediately).|
pg| ***** 345 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Try to keep parity with both the dummy and the declarer.

It is easier to keep length partity with the dummy because you can see it.|
