    Opening Leads Against Suit Contracts   
  }
^-

|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3When making your opening lead against a suit contract, a major concern is whether to initiiate an 'active' or a 'passive' defense.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|

'Active' means leading from a Queen or King or even plunking down an Ace in a suit when you don't have the King.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at|

'Passive' means leading a trump or, perhaps, some suit they have bid, playing the waiting game: waiting for declarer to open up side suits rather than you.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|

Keep in mind that declarer has two main ways of getting rid of losers:|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|

(1) ruffing them in dummy, the short trump hand;|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|

(2) discarding them on an established suit in the dummy.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|

If you fear (1), lead a trump.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


at|

If you fear (2), make an attacking lead.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|

If you fear neither, try to play passively.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |

Picking the right suit to lead
^-|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


fp||at|^B@2^Z@3Before making  your opening lead, it helps to ask yourself a few pertinent questions.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


at|

(1) What can you pick up from the opponents bidding?|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


at|

 Do they have a fit?|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


at| 

Did they stagger into game or did they bid it confidently?|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


at|

Did they shy away from NT because they were weak in one suit?|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


at|

(2) Did partner stick in a bid? |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


at|

Did partner have a chance to make a one-level overcall and didn't? |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


at|

Did partner have a chance to make a lead-directing double of an artificial bid and didn't?|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


at|

(3) Do you have a short suit?|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


at| 

Does partner? |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


at|

Maybe you should try for a ruff, or maybe you should try to give partner a ruff.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3(4) What about your trump holding? |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


at|

Your trump holding frequently dictates your opening lead. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


at|

For example, if you have trump control (Ax, Axx, or Kxx) short suit leads are attractive.|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


at|

(5) Have you a strong honor sequence headed by the AK or the KQJ? |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


at|

If so you probably don't have to worry about the other rules. |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


at|

Read on for some examples of these tips, all designed to help you select the killing opening lead.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |

When to lead trump
^-|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


fp||at|^B@2^Z@3Have you heard this one? 'When in doubt, lead a trump.'|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


at|

If you have, forget it.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


at|

Although trump leads can be devastating, more often than not they are disastrous.|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


at|

They are disastrous when dummy has a long strong suit and declarer draws trumps and discards losers on that suit; tricks you could have taken had you led one of those suits.|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Trump leads that expose trump honors in partner's hand can also turn partner into one unhappy camper.|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


at|

But that doesn't mean that you should never lead a trump.|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


at|

In fact, there are some bidding sequences that practically scream for a trump lead.|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


at||fp|3|at|^-

Declarer bids two suits and dummy prefers the second
^-|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


fp||at|^B@2^Z@3When dummy prefers declarer's ^*Isecond^*  suit, and you have winning tricks or eventual winning tricks in declarer's first bid suit, put a trump on the track to protect those winners.|

Lead a Heart to cut down dummy's ruffing power.|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Later, when in with the @sA, lead another Heart.|

Every trump you lead translates into one less Spade ruff in the dummy and another eventual Spade trick for you.|

^-|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


fP||at|^B@2^Z@3When you make a one-level takeout double and partner passes, it is ^*Inot^*  out of weakness.|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


at|

It is because partner thinks her trump holding is longer (or as long as) and stronger than declarer's. |
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


at|

Partner is saying 'Help me draw declarer's trumps.'|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |

nt|^B@2^Z@3Partner is not supposed to have @hKJ943, but more like @hQJT97 or@HKJT964.|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |

Partner (a good partner, that is) has the intemediate spots, not declarer .|

Dummy usually has three trumps with a side-suit singleton, or more likely a side-suit doubleton.|

However, there are two occasions where a trump lead is so aboninable that it cannot even be mentioned in mixed company: |
pg| ***** 71 ***** |

nt||st||bg||md||mb|1sp2cp2sp4sppp|

nt|^B@2^Z@3Dummy figures to have five or six Clubs and three Spades. Declarer is likely to use some or all of the Clubs to discard red suit losers. |
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


at|

Your Club holding usually dictates your choice of opening leads.

|
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Unless you have very strong Clubs, you should make an attacking lead, leading from your stronger side suit, but not the one that is headed by the Ace.|

It will be easier (and faster) to develop Heart tricks as opposed to Diamond tricks before declarer drives out your @cA.|

When there is a long suit in dummy (Clubs), plus trump support, there must also be a short suit.|

pg| ***** 95 ***** |


fp||at|^b@2^Z@3Think back to hands you have played at a trump contract only to discover one opponent has four trumps. |
pg| ***** 96 ***** |


at|

Very annoying, right? You have to use four of your precious trumps to remove theirs.|
pg| ***** 97 ***** |


at|

Furthermore, if you started with five trumps and you have already trumped once, you have only four left. |
pg| ***** 98 ***** |


at|

Drawing trump means leaving yourself trumpless.|
pg| ***** 99 ***** |


at|

It means playing the hand at notrump, something you may not find palatable. |
pg| ***** 100 ***** |


at|

And if you don't draw trumps, the player with the four trumps is almost sure to trump one of your winning tricks sooner or later. |
pg| ***** 101 ***** |


at|

Not pretty.|
pg| ***** 102 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Now change seats. |
pg| ***** 103 ***** |


at|

This time you are the defender with those four annoying trumps. |
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


at|

You have a mighty weapon at your disposal even if those four trumps are baby-size, let alone if they are headed by an honor or two. |
pg| ***** 105 ***** |


at|

How should you take advantage of your riches?|
pg| ***** 106 ***** |


md||mb||st||bg||nt|^B@2^Z@3At a trump contract, the player who holds the majority of the trump cards is usually master of the house. |
pg| ***** 107 ***** |


at|

Say the trump suit is divided like this:|
pg| ***** 108 ***** |


ha|y|nt||md|kqt95,a742,j83,6|
pg| ***** 109 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Declarer starts life with one more trump than you. |
pg| ***** 110 ***** |


at|

But let's say you lead some suit that forces him to ruff.|
pg| ***** 111 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Now you each have four trumps. |
pg| ***** 112 ***** |


at|

Say when you get in with the @sA, you  make him ruff again.|
pg| ***** 113 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Suddenly you have  more trumps than him! South has lost control of the hand. |
pg| ***** 114 ***** |


at|

Only good things can happen from here on in.|
pg| ***** 115 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3It all boils down to this: holding four trumps against a declarer who figures to have four or five trumps, the best strategy is usually to try to force declarer to ruff. |
pg| ***** 116 ***** |


at|

In other words, lead from your longest suit and hope it is declarer's shortest.|
pg| ***** 117 ***** |


ha||nt||md|,a732h86dqt743cq6|mb|1np2cp2sp3sp4sppp|
pg| ***** 118 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Lead a Diamond. |
pg| ***** 119 ***** |


at|

Even though the opponents are playing a 4-4 fit, if you can make either hand ruff a Diamond, they will be playing a 4-3 fit.|
pg| ***** 120 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Later, if you can force the hand with ^*ifour^*  trumps, the 'long hand,' to ruff another Diamond, your trump holding will be longer than that of either opponent. |
pg| ***** 121 ***** |


at|

You will have wrested control of the hand from declarer.|
pg| ***** 122 ***** |


nt||md|,q45h3dkt87ck9432|mb|pp1cp1hp1np2dp3hppp|
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Sometimes you can tell from the bidding that partner has four trump. |
pg| ***** 124 ***** |


at|

Your plan should be the same: lead from length hoping it is declarer's shortness.|
pg| ***** 125 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Partner must have at least four Hearts; lead a Club.|

^-|
pg| ***** 127 ***** |


fp||at|^b@2^Z@3Bridge players just love to lead singletons or doubletons. They'd lead a void if they could. |
pg| ***** 128 ***** |


at|

Short-suit leads often work like a charm: if you have a singleton and partner has the Ace you are off to a flying start.|
pg| ***** 129 ***** |


at|

But what if partner ^*idoesn't^*  have the Ace? You are still okay if either you or partner has a ^*Iquick trump entry^*  such as the Ace. |
pg| ***** 130 ***** |


at|

If you have the trump Ace, you may be able to find an entry in partner's hand and still get your ruff.|
pg| ***** 131 ***** |


at|

Clearly the best time to lead a short suit is ^*Iyou^*  have a trump entry, a trump suit that looks like: Ax,  Axx,  Axxx, or Kxxx. |
pg| ***** 132 ***** |


at|

With Axxxx or Kxxx you have to decide whether to try for ruffs by leading your short suit or whether to go the other way and lead from your long suit trying to force declarer to ruff.|
pg| ***** 133 ***** |


at|

On the other hand, your trump suit might be such that ruffing one of declarer's tricks actually costs you a trump trick so you gain nothing.|
pg| ***** 134 ***** |


at|

For example, trump suits that look like KQT,  QJx  or JTxx do ^*Inot^*  lend themselves to short suit leads.|

fp||at|^B@2^Z@3Once you have decided which suit to lead, you still have to lead the proper card in the suit so partner knows what is going on. |

For the moment assume you are holding an unbid suit, or perhaps a suit ^*you^*  have bid. |

Here's what you should lead from various holdings:|

Txx,  Jxx,  Qxx,  Kxx,  lead low. However, with Axx, if you choose to lead the suit, you usually lead the Ace.|

This is a toughie. |

If you lead high it looks like a doubleton.  |
pg| ***** 202 ***** |


at|

If you lead low it looks like from an honor.  |
pg| ***** 203 ***** |


at|

If you lead the middle nobody knows what it looks like.  |
pg| ***** 204 ***** |


at|

Best is to avoid leading from three small if you can help it.  |
pg| ***** 205 ***** |


at|

Experts tend to lead low from three small, but for the rank and file, 'top of nothing' is better.|
pg| ***** 206 ***** |

Three small cards in a suit partner has bid
^-|
pg| ***** 207 ***** |


fp||at|^B@2^Z@3This one is easier.  |
pg| ***** 208 ***** |


at|

If you have ^*inot^*  supported, lead low, if you ^*ihave^*  supported, lead high. |
pg| ***** 209 ***** |


at|

Do the same with four small cards.|
pg| ***** 210 ***** |


at|

Say you have @d842 and partner bids Diamonds.

If you have supported Diamonds lead the @d8; if you haven't, lead the @d2.|

Four or more cards headed by one honor
or two non-consecutive honors

Lead the fourth best.  |
pg| ***** 213 ***** |


at|

From Txxx(x),  Jxxx(x),  Qxxx(x),  Kxxx(x),  QTxx(x)  or KJxx(x), lead your fourth highest card, just as in notrump. |
pg| ***** 214 ***** |


at|

If your suit is headed by the Ace, lead the Ace although leading from an unsupported Ace is a rare bird.|

pg| ***** 216 ***** |


fp||at|^B@2^Z@3Ace ^dThis book suggests the lead of the Ace from AKxx(x)(x), thus clarifying 
^Dthe lead of the King which shows the KQ. |

^DHowever, this is a ^*itrick one^*  convention only. |

^DAfter trick one the King is led from both AK and KQ combinations.|

^D^*IHowever, the King is also led from the AKxx(x) at trick one if:^*   |

^D(1) You are leading a suit partner has bid whether or not you have supported. |
pg| ***** 221 ***** |

^d(2) You are leading a suit you have bid and partner has supported. |
pg| ***** 222 ***** |


at|

^d(3) Your opponents are playing the contract at the five-level or higher.|
pg| ***** 223 ***** |


at|

^D In each of these situations, it is common to lead the Ace without the King, therefore 
^Dthe King is led to avoid that confusion.|

King ^DFrom suits headed by the KQ (or Kx).|

Queen ^dFrom suits headed by the QJ (or Qx).|

Reminders

pg| ***** 230 ***** |


fp||at|^B@2^Z@3(1) Once again it is suggested that the lead of both the 9 and Ten should be different from 'standard practice. |
pg| ***** 231 ***** |


at|

The standard lead from the KJT is the Jack; here the Ten is suggestedd, making it clear that when partner leads a Jack it is his highest card. |
pg| ***** 232 ***** |


at|

Also, just as against notrump, lead the 9 from the QT9 or KT9 combinations as well as top of a doubleton or even top of nothing.|
pg| ***** 233 ***** |


at|

(2) Against a suit contract, leading from the AJT or AT9 or from an unsupported Ace (unless it is Ax) is rare.  |
pg| ***** 234 ***** |


at|

If you try it lead the Ace.|
pg| ***** 235 ***** |


at|

3) Underleading an Ace is even rarer than leading an Ace. |
pg| ***** 236 ***** |


at|

Although it can work out well, it tends to backfire because partner can seldom read it (or believe it).|
pg| ***** 237 ***** |


at|

(4) In contrast to when you are defending against a notrump contract, an honor lead agains a suit contract can show ^*Itwo^*  touching honors, not necessarily a three- or four-card honor sequence.|
