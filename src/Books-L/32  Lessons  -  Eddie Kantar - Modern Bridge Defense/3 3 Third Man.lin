pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3This chapter deals with the partner of the opening leader, third hand. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|

In this chapter you shift seats; partner makes an opening lead, dummy comes down, and you are expected to make the proper play to the first trick. |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at|

More contracts are lost at the first trick than any other, usually by third hand screwing up.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|

This chapter will be devoted to giving you helpful insights so you can avoid these screw-ups and impress everyone with your expertise at trick one. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|

Of course, there is still trick two to deal with if you win the first trick.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|

It all starts with the card your partner leads. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|

If partner leads low, the presumption is that she is leading from length with an honor or two in that suit.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


at|

If partner leads an honor, the presumption is an honor sequence. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|

If partner leads a suit you have bid but partner has not supported, that's a horse of a different color. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


at|

Now, presumably, partner is leading from shortness.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|

Let's see how you should react to each of these leads.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |

pg| ***** 16 ***** |


fp||nt|^B@2^Z@3Third hand high is a good general rule to follow, but wouldn't you know it, it's only right about half the time.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


at|

Let's start with a common position where it is clearly right.|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |

nt|^B@2^Z@3Say this is notrump and partner leads the @s2.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


ha|y|wt|w|pc|s|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


at|

This is a classic case of playing third hand high because:|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


hs|ns|nt|^B@2^Z@3(1) dummy has small cards,|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


hc|skj|ls|ns|at|

(2) your high cards are not equals.|

lc|skj|pc|sk|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


pc|sjs|nt|^B@2^Z@3You squish declarer's Queen between your Jack and partner's Ace.|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


at|

Let's look at the wrong way.|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


up|4|nt|^B@2^Z@3|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


pc|sjsq|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3This gives declarer a cheap trick and the lead.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


at|

He has gained a tempo to attack other suits.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


md||nt|^B@2^Z@3^*bWhen you have equal high cards, play the lower or lowest equal.^* |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3In the previous example you held the @sKJ4.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


at|

Your Spade honors were not equals, but if you had @sQJ4, they would be.|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Now hear this: when third hand has two or more ^*Iequal^*  high cards, third hand plays the lower or lowest equal first.|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


at|

Better re-read that, it's sacred.|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3When third hand has two or more ^*Iequal^*  high cards, third hand plays the lower or lowest equal first.|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt||md|,2,863,qj5|wt|w|pc|sssj|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3When partner sees your Jack, partner realizes you may have the Queen, but cannot have the @s10.|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


at| Why?|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3The @sJ and @s10 are equals, so if you had the @SJ10, you would play the 10 not the Jack.|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


at|

This leads us too:|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3^*bWhenever third hand plays high, third hand can never have the card directly beneath the one played.^* |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


at|

Here's another tip:|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


md||nt|^B@2^Z@3^*iIf the lead is low, dummy has small cards, and you play the Jack, you cannot have the 10.|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


at|

Furthermore, if you are looking at the Queen, the card directly above the one partner has played, you know partner has played her highest card.^* |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


nt||pn|Declarer,You,Dummy,Partner|md|a,k9762,8543,j|
Pg| ***** 48 ***** |


hc|s6|nt|^B@2^Z@3Say Hearts are trumps and you decide to lead the @s6.|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


lc|s6|wt|w|pc|s6ssjsa|nt|^B@2^Z@3What can you deduce?|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


at|

Your thinking should go like this:|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Partner cannot have the @s10, having played the Jack, so declarer has that card.|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


at|

Partner has neither confirmed nor denied the @sQ by playing the @sJ.|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3However, if declarer had the @sAQ, she would surely have taken the first trick with the @sQ.|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


at|

Conclusion: partner started with the @sQJ and declarer with the @sA10.|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


md|a,q9762,8543,j|wt|w|pc|s6ssjsa|nt|^B@2^Z@3If you had led from @sQ9726, and the same plays had been made at trick one, you could deduce that declarer held @sAK10.|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Partner's @sJ denied the @s10, and because you have the @sQ, partner's @sJ must be her highest card.|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


md||nt|^B@2^Z@3Before playing third hand high, make sure none of your spot cards are equal to one of your honor cards!|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


pn|Declarer,Partner,Dummy,You|
nt||md|,3,t65,jq9|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


hc|s9t|wt|w|pc|ss|nt|^B@2^Z@3It's true that your @sQJ are equals, but your 9 is also the equal of the Jack because the 10 is in dummy.|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


pc|sj|lc|s9t|nt|^B@2^Z@3When you play the Jack your partner will labor under the mistaken impression for the entire hand the declarer holds the 9.|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


up|1|pc|s|nt|^B@2^Z@3The proper play is the 9.|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


up|1|pc|sq|nt|^B@2^Z@3Don't even ask what you do to partner if you play the Queen.|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


up|1|pc|s9|at|

Also, your play of the 9 denies the 8.|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


at| Having fun?|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


nt||pn|Declarer,You,Dummy,Partner|md||nt|^B@2^Z@3For the following exercises, put yourself in the opening leader's chair and assume you are playing with a bright partner, who has not only read this chapter, but actully understood it.|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


nt||md|k,q2347,t65,8|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3It's notrump and your lead.|
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


wt|w|pc|s3sss|
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


at|

Who has all the missing cards?|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


at| You can do it!|
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3The missing cards are the 9, Jack and Ace.|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


at|

If partner had the Ace, partner would have played it (third hand high).|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Okay, declarer has the Ace. 

What about the @s9 and Jack?|
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3If declarer held either of those cards, there would have been no need to win the trick with the King.|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


at|

Partner must have them both. Declarer started with @sAKx and partner @sJ98.|
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


nt||sb|wThere's no stopping me now!|
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


md||nt|^B@2^Z@3Now let's change things a tiny bit:|
sb||
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


nt||md|a,q7234,t65,9|
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


nt||wt|w|pc|s3sss|
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3What s really going on here?|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3If partner had the @sK, he would have played it third hand high, so declarer has that card. |
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


at|^B@2^Z@3

Declarer must also have the @s8 since partner played the @s9, denying the card directly beneath, remember?|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3That leaves the Jack.|
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3If declarer had the @sAKJ, declarer would have taken the first trick with the Jack, so declarer has the @SAK8 and partner the @sJ9.|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


up|4|at|

Now try this:|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


nt||md|j,q7234,t65,9|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3The same diagram but this time partner plays the @s9 and declarer the @sJ.|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


nt||wt|w|pc|ssss|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Can you work it out?|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


at|

Partner must have a singleton and declarer the @sAKJ8.|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3You have run into a hornet's nest!|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


at|

If you this were a suit contract, you would know that partner could ruff the second round of the suit.|
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


md||nt|^B@2^Z@3And now a practical application:|
pg| ***** 94 ***** |


at|

You are on opening lead versus a notrump contract and the opponents have gone through Stayman and declarer denies a 4-card major.|
pg| ***** 95 ***** |


md|q,k976,234,j|wt|w|pc|ssssq|
pg| ***** 96 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Believe it or not, you can figure out where every other card is and eqaully important,|
pg| ***** 97 ***** |


at| what to do about it.|
pg| ***** 98 ***** |


at|

For openers, declarer must have thhe @sA.|
pg| ***** 99 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Holding @sAJx(x), your partner plays the Ace.|
pg| ***** 100 ***** |


at|

Moving right along, declarer must have the @s10 as well.|
pg| ***** 101 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3If partner has the @sJ10, partner plays the 10, not the Jack (lower equal).|
pg| ***** 102 ***** |


at|

Since declarer denied four Spades, and since you know declarer has the @SAQ10, partner has the J85.|
pg| ***** 103 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Elementary, my dear Watson.|
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


at|

More importantly, if you regain the lead before partner, you must not lead a Spade into declarer's @sA10.|
pg| ***** 105 ***** |


at| You must wait for partner to continue the suit.|
pg| ***** 106 ***** |


md||nt|^B@2^Z@3Until now dummy had been coming down with low cards, but that is not always the case.|
pg| ***** 107 ***** |


at|^*i

Dummy may hit with with an honor and you may have a higher honor.^* |
pg| ***** 108 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Scenes like this are quite common: |
pg| ***** 109 ***** |


nt||pn|Declarer,Partner,Dummy,You|md|,2,q73,kt4|
pg| ***** 110 ***** |


wt|w|pc|ss|
pg| ***** 111 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3There is a rule to cover this situation.|
pg| ***** 112 ***** |


at| Are you thrilled?|
pg| ***** 113 ***** |


at| 

The rule: |
pg| ***** 114 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3^*IWhen partner leads low, dummy has an honor, but plays low, and third hand has a higher honor than dummy, third hand inserts a 9 or higher, if possible, rather than playing the honor. |
pg| ***** 115 ***** |


at| Lacking a 9 or higher to insert, third hand plays the honor.^* |
pg| ***** 116 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Pretty long rule isn't it?|
pg| ***** 117 ***** |


at| But it is an important one.|
pg| ***** 118 ***** |


pc|st|
pg| ***** 119 ***** |


at|

Given the rule you should stick in the 10.|
pg| ***** 120 ***** |


md|,s2,q37,k94|wt|w|pc|sss9|nt|^B@2^Z@3If you had the K94 you would stick in the 9.|
pg| ***** 121 ***** |


md|,2,q37,k84|wt|w|pc|ss|nt|^B@2^Z@3If you had the K84 you would play the King. |
pg| ***** 122 ***** |


nt||pc|sk|
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


hc|s8|nt|^B@2^Z@3It usually saves a trick if you conserve your honor to capture dummy's honor - but you need a 9-spot or better to make it worthwhile.|
pg| ***** 124 ***** |


lc|s8|nt||md|98,q23t,k56,aj74|wt|w|pc|sssjs|
pg| ***** 125 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Lo and behold, it takes a trick.|
pg| ***** 126 ***** |


at|

Now you have to be patient, patient for partner to get in and lead an honor through dummy's King.|
pg| ***** 127 ***** |


at| Shift to another suit.|
pg| ***** 128 ***** |


md||nt|^B@2^Z@3Sure you may be thinking it works like a charm to play the Jack when partner has the Queen, but what if declarer has the Queen?|
pg| ***** 129 ***** |


nt||md|q8,t932,k56,aj74|wt|w|pc|sssjsq|
pg| ***** 130 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Same scene.|at| 

Be patient.|
pg| ***** 131 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Next time partner gets the lead she might try the @s10.|
pg| ***** 132 ***** |


wt|w|pc|sts|
pg| ***** 133 ***** |


nt||wt|n|pc|sksa|
pg| ***** 134 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3This time you capture King with the Ace and declarer ends up with 1 Spade trick.|
pg| ***** 135 ***** |


up|8|wt|w|pc|sssas|
pg| ***** 136 ***** |
pg| ***** 137 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Had you played the Ace at trick one (a Nervous Nellie play) declarer winds up with two Spade tricks.|
pg| ***** 138 ***** |


md||nt|^B@2^Z@3^*IWhen dummy has an honor that is higher than third hand's honor, third hand plays as if there were no honor at all in the dummy.|
pg| ***** 139 ***** |


nt||md|,2,k83,qt75|
pg| ***** 140 ***** |


wt|w|pc|sssq|
pg| ***** 141 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3The play of the Queen is the same you would have made if dummy had only low Spades. |
pg| ***** 142 ***** |


at|

Similarly, if your Spades were @SQJ7 and dummy played low, you would play the @sJ, your lower equal.|

pg| ***** 146 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Playing equal honors out of order (higher- lower) indicates a doubleton.|

nt||md|53,4,a36,qjt9|

nt|^B@2^Z@3^*BThe Rule of Eleven^* |
pg| ***** 181 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Are you ready for a rule that has been around for over one hundred years and is still working?|
pg| ***** 182 ***** |


at|

It is called the Rule of Eleven and only declarer and third hand can use it.|
pg| ***** 183 ***** |

nt|^B@2^Z@3At notrump partner leads the @s5,|

at| presumably fourth best.|
pg| ***** 188 ***** |


at|

(For this rule to work, partner must be leading fourth best.)|
pg| ***** 189 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Subtract the size of the card your partner leads from 11 (11 - 5 = 6).|
pg| ***** 190 ***** |


at|

That "6" is the key number.|
pg| ***** 191 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3It tells you that there are six cards higher than the five in the three ^*Iremaining^*  hands: dummy's, yours and declarer's.|
pg| ***** 192 ***** |


hc|s976|nt|^B@2^Z@3You count the number of cards higher than the five in the dummy (three)|

Time to apply the "rule".|

nt|^B@2^Z@3There are four cards higher than the @s7 in the three ^*Iremaining^*  hands.|

at|

For example:|

wt|w|pc|s|
pg| ***** 212 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3There should be four cards higher than the @s7 in the three remaining hand.|

hc|saqkt93|nt|^B@2^Z@3You see two of them in dummy and three in your hand, for a total of five, and there are supposed to be only four.|
pg| ***** 214 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Has the rule been repealed after a hundred years? Is it on vacation?|
pg| ***** 215 ***** |


at|

No your partner has not led fourth highest - rather, a top card looking for your strength, or perhaps the @s7 from @sJ87.|

There is also a corollary:|
pg| ***** 261 ***** |


md||nt|^B@2^Z@3If dummy leads low and dummy wins the trick and third hand has a lower doubleton honor, it is almost always right to unload the honor.|

nt|^B@2^Z@3So much for your proper play at trick one: there is trick two to deal with as well.|
pg| ***** 683 ***** |

You may win the opening lead and wish to return partner's suit, or the opponents may win the first trick but you still wish to return partner's suit later in the hand.|
pg| ***** 684 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3The idea in most cases is to give partner ^*Icount^*  with your second card, unblocking the suit if necessary.|
pg| ***** 685 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@31) With two remaining cards, return the higher.|

2) With three cards remaining, return the lowest.|
pg| ***** 687 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@33) With more than three cards remaining return your ^*ioriginal^*  fourth-highest.|
pg| ***** 688 ***** |

4) With an honor sequence remaining return the higher or highest card in the sequence.|

sk||nt|^B@2^Z@3Partner knows you started with three Spades (with four you would have returned low) and doesn't cash the @sK setting up declarer's guarded Queen.|
pg| ***** 707 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Instead partner switches and waits for you to lead a third Spade through declarer's Queen.|

nt|^B@2^Z@3If partner were the declarer, that is exactly how she would play Spades if she were planning to run the suit.|
pg| ***** 714 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Defense is very similar to declarer play: the only problem is that declarer can see both hands and you can't!|

nt|^B@2^Z@3Partner should be able to work out what is going on when declarer plays the Jack and the Queen.|

sb|w|nt|^B@2^Z@3If declarer held the @sQJT, you would have started out with the @sA743.|

With this holding you would have returned your lowest card from three remaining, the @s3.|

You remain with a sequence and should return the highest card in that remaining sequence.|

nt|^B@2^Z@3Don't think that just because your eight drove out the Queen that partner knows you started with the @sJT98.|
pg| ***** 731 ***** |


at|

For all partner knows, you may have started with the @sT98 leaving declarer with the @sQJ5.|
pg| ***** 732 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Your return clarifies the position.|

Before leaving this topic, the following three combinations must be addressed:|

ha|y|nt||sk|e|md|qt5,j237,96,ak84|
pg| ***** 735 ***** |


wt|w|pc|ss|
pg| ***** 736 ***** |


ha|y|sk|e|nt|^B@2^Z@3At notrump partner leads the @s2 telling you that declarer has ^*Ithree^*  cards in the suit.|
pg| ***** 737 ***** |


at|

Rather than win the @sA and return the King, it is a stronger play to win the King (or the Ace as a falsecard) and return the @s4.|

nt|^B@2^Z@3Declarer with a possible @sQTx holding, may go wrong and insert the 10 playing you for the Jack and partner for the other high honors.|
pg| ***** 741 ***** |


sk||at|

This normal play by the declarer allows the good guys to run the suit.|
pg| ***** 742 ***** |


md||nt|^B@2^Z@3But then there is this:|
pg| ***** 743 ***** |


ha|y|nt||sk|e|md|q7,jt235,96,ak84|
pg| ***** 744 ***** |


wt|w|pc|s3ssks|
pg| ***** 745 ***** |


ha|y|nt|^B@2^Z@3This time partner's lead against notrump is the @s3, meaning that if you can't see the deuce partner could have a five-card suit leaving declarer with a doubleton.|
pg| ***** 746 ***** |


at|

When you win the trick and declarer does not play the deuce, play your high honor!|
pg| ***** 747 ***** |


sk||pc|sa|nt|^B@2^Z@3Don't lead low, as you did in the previous diagram; you are paying good money for this lesson!|

pg| ***** 751 ***** |


wt|w|pc|s2ssqs|
pg| ***** 752 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Your plan is to play two top Spades even though you suspect declarer is going to ruff.|
pg| ***** 753 ***** |


up|1|at|

If you win the first trick with the Queen, you tell declarer that you started with the @sAKQ.|
pg| ***** 754 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3That in turn may help declarer place all other defensive HCP.|

sk||pc|sq|nt|^B@2^Z@3However, if you win the first trick with your ^*IAce^*  and return the Queen, declarer may place partner with the King, and perhaps form a false impression of where the other honors are.|
pg| ***** 758 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Notice that partner is not fooled.|
pg| ***** 759 ***** |


at|

Once declarer ruffs, partner knows your exact holding.|
pg| ***** 760 ***** |


md||nt|^B@2^Z@3^*BWhen third hand plays before the dummy^*  |
pg| ***** 761 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3You make an opening lead, dummy comes down, and partner is third hand.|
pg| ***** 762 ***** |


at|

But whenever partner leads a suit first, suddenly you are third hand looking at the dummy to your left.|
pg| ***** 763 ***** |


pn|Declarer,You,Dummy,Partner|nt|^B@2^Z@3Does this change anything? You'd love to read 'No, it doesn't', wouldn't you?|

pg| ***** 769 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Use your @s9 to drive out the @sA.

Don't even think of playing the 10.|
pg| ***** 770 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3If you play the 10 you deny the nine, making both your partner and the author shudder.|
pg| ***** 771 ***** |

Since partner's lead marks declarer with the King, you save a trick by inserting the 10.|
