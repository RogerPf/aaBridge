He often took his bridge books to junior and senior high school, hiding them beneath his textbooks. One of his instructors was so impressed with his "study" habits that he mentioned it in class, causing Eddie to sweat bullets fearing the teacher would come a little closer and see "Reese on Play" superimposed over the history book he was supposed to be studying.|

ht|k|va|4|at|^B@2At the high school level many of the girls who had boyfriends in college found out that Eddie played bridge and begged him to teach them the game. He did, with high hopes in mind, but the minute they thought they knew how to play, he never heard from them again. At the University of Minnesota where he studied foreign languages (now he can enjoy bridge books written in French and Italian),  he taught bridge and sold football souvenirs to pay his tuition.

|ht|p|at|^B@2Eddie Kantar's bridge wisdom combined with his wit makes reading his popular books a learning experience (at any level) as well as a true pleasure. He is one of the best known bridge writers in the world. He has written some 25 bridge books, some available in CD-Rom form, and is also a regular contributor to the ACBL Bulletin, Bridge World, Bridge Today, and OKbridge. A two-time World Champion, Eddie is highly regarded as a player, and he competes regularly on the National level.  He is known as one of bridge's great ambassadors.

{ TO BALANCE OR NOT TO BALANCE? }
^-|ht|e|fp||at|^B@2When the opponents conk out at the one or two level, it usually means that you and partner have about the same strength as they do. The questions is — should you let them play there, or should you stir up the pot and reopen the bidding? Try this quiz to see how well versed you are at the art of balancing. 

Assume you are playing in a team game, neither side is vulnerable and you are sitting South holding this hand:

@SAJ76  @H54  @CQT9 @DK876 

Decide what you would do in the following six sequences:|

Your bid is Pass. A double in this sequence shows heart length and strength with opening bid values. Not exactly what you have. Remember, they haven't found a fit in this sequence.

Your bid is Double. Just barely. You have four card support for the unbids (mandatory), but you also have a wasted @CQ on offense.

Your bid is Pass.  It would be pushing the pencil a bit to double here. Your @DK is misplaced and you don't have four card support for both unbid suits.

Your bid is Double.  A double in this position can be shaded down to 9-10 HCP if you have the right distribution-shortness in their suit plus support for the unbids.
