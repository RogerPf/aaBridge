cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Opener has six or seven clubs with a minimum hand. Responder has a strong hand with five hearts and four spades, possibly four hearts and four spades, as responder may be looking for a diamond stopper for 3NT. The 3@D bid is ambiguous and could be looking for a diamond stopper in openers hand. It could be argued that the 3@D bid is looking for half a stopper (Qx, Jxx) in opener's hand as the opener apparently doesn't have a full stopper not having bid 2NT over 2@S. This is a tricky sequence.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|It looks like responder has five diamonds, four spades,three good hearts, and is exploring possible game or even slam contracts. Responder is still unlimited. Had responder four hearts, he would have raised hearts over the 1@H bid.|
