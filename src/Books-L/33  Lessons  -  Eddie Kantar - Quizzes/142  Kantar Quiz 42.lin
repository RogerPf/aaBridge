(c) is at least in the ballpark because of the heart fit. 3@H is another possibility, but both bids would be stretches.|

Facing none, play in game, opposite one With one play in 6@C, facing two shoot the works! (a) is a clear-cut 4@S bid and (b) should cuebid 4@H hoping to hear 4@S. If partner does bid 4@S, try 4NT. If partner bids 5@C over 4@H, bid 6@C hoping partner has the @CA. Sometimes you have to take a chance. |

This sequence is supposed to show six reasonable hearts or five very good ones (KQJ9x, AQJTx). You get the idea.|
