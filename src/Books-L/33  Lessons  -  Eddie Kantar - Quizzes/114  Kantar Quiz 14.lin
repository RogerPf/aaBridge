He often took his bridge books to junior and senior high school, hiding them beneath his textbooks. One of his instructors was so impressed with his "study" habits that he mentioned it in class, causing Eddie to sweat bullets fearing the teacher would come a little closer and see "Reese on Play" superimposed over the history book he was supposed to be studying.|

ht|k|va|4|at|^B@2At the high school level many of the girls who had boyfriends in college found out that Eddie played bridge and begged him to teach them the game. He did, with high hopes in mind, but the minute they thought they knew how to play, he never heard from them again. At the University of Minnesota where he studied foreign languages (now he can enjoy bridge books written in French and Italian),  he taught bridge and sold football souvenirs to pay his tuition.

|ht|p|at|^B@2Eddie Kantar's bridge wisdom combined with his wit makes reading his popular books a learning experience (at any level) as well as a true pleasure. He is one of the best known bridge writers in the world. He has written some 25 bridge books, some available in CD-Rom form, and is also a regular contributor to the ACBL Bulletin, Bridge World, Bridge Today, and OKbridge. A two-time World Champion, Eddie is highly regarded as a player, and he competes regularly on the National level.  He is known as one of bridge's great ambassadors.

Bid 3@S followed by 4@H. On a good day partner will have three cards in one of your suit or perhaps even a doubleton honor. On a bad day, a very bad day, partner will have a singleton in both majors. |mb|3s|

Bid 4NT. Simple Blackwood. If partner has one ace, 6@C can be no worse than a finesse.|mb|4n|

Pass. If you can't get yourself to pass this hand (no fit, no suit of your own to run), you are one dangerous partner! |mb|p|

Bid 5NT. The Grand Slam Force asking partner to bid seven with two of the top three honors in the last bid suit. With one honor, partner bids 6@C. With no honors, partner will also bid 6@C meaning it is time to shop around for another partner.  |mb|5n|an|Grand Slam Force|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|"Grand Slam Force" is an old fashioned convention that is no longer used. Once Roman Key Card Blackwood was invented, the Grand Slam force was no longer needed since RKCB allows responder to find out about all 3 of the top trump honors. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


SK||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So on this hand the modern bid is 4NT, which would allow you to find out if partner had the AK of clubs. Yes, it is barely possible that partner would show 2 key cards with the DA and CK, but that is too remote a possibility to worry about. An expert responder might bid 5D, which is "exclusion blackwood", telling partner to not count the @DA when responding as to the number of key cards.|
