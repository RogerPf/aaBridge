HT|s|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Hand C is the correct answer.  Hand A should bid 4@H before the opponents find their diamond fit; Hand B should pass because it had no defense against any other contract your double may chase them to. Hand C is just right for the bid. |

HT|s|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Hand C is the correct answer.  When a passed hand bids 1NT in the direct position it is unusual. Your double showed at least 5-5 in the blacks. Hand B should pass... quickly and hand A has a perfect passed hand takout double.|
