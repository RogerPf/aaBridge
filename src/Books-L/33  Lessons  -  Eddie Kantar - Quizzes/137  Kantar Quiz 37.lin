You start this quiz with 150 points to the good, but you lose 10 points with each 'accident'. You are always South, not vulnerable against vulnerable playing rubber bridge for real money. You are South holding this hand|

Also, partner doesn't seem to have a diamond stopper so you shouldn't worry about him having two suits unstopped!|ht|j|cs|6|at|^k{|ia|,1N2S!3n|at|}|
