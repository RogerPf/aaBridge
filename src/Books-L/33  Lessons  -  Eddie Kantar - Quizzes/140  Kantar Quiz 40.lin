     40  -  MATCH YOUR BIDDING WITH DON KRAUSS     }
^-|CS||fp||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|My good friend Don Krauss has represented the United States twice in World Championship play and has consistently done well at the National Level, the true test. 

He formed successful partnerships with the legendary Lew Mathe and Bob Hamman, for many years the ##1 ranked player in the world. 

Don was also a successful rubber bridge player in San Francisco. Now retired, Don still plays locally and still keeps on winning.

Now, you match wits with Don on the following 10 rubber bridge problems from actual play, sitting in the South seat. |

^B@2^*BDon Krauss: ^*N|cp||at|Bid 3@H. We tend to make positive responses to 2@C openings when we have something clear to bid (overlooking one time when I opened 2@C, Lew responded 2@S and I had the AKQJxx of spades!) |
n#|5|at|^^Maybe I can find out if partner has any heart support. If he does not I will bid 7@S as there cannot be a possible loser outside of hearts. The only thing can maybe beat a grand slam is three small hearts in partner's hand and that is what I am trying to uncover.|
