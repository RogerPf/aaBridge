He often took his bridge books to junior and senior high school, hiding them beneath his textbooks. One of his instructors was so impressed with his "study" habits that he mentioned it in class, causing Eddie to sweat bullets fearing the teacher would come a little closer and see "Reese on Play" superimposed over the history book he was supposed to be studying.|

ht|L|va|4|at|^B@2At the high school level many of the girls who had boyfriends in college found out that Eddie played bridge and begged him to teach them the game. He did, with high hopes in mind, but the minute they thought they knew how to play, he never heard from them again. At the University of Minnesota where he studied foreign languages (now he can enjoy bridge books written in French and Italian),  he taught bridge and sold football souvenirs to pay his tuition.

|ht|p|at|^B@2Eddie Kantar's bridge wisdom combined with his wit makes reading his popular books a learning experience (at any level) as well as a true pleasure. He is one of the best known bridge writers in the world. He has written some 25 bridge books, some available in CD-Rom form, and is also a regular contributor to the ACBL Bulletin, Bridge World, Bridge Today, and OKbridge. A two-time World Champion, Eddie is highly regarded as a player, and he competes regularly on the National level.  He is known as one of bridge's great ambassadors.

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Bid 2@D  A "fake reverse" to force partner to bid again. Next you will support hearts giving partner a pretty good idea of your hand. A jump to 3@C is not forcing and might miss a 5-3 heart fit. |mb|2d|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Bid 5@S. A raise to the five level of the last bid major in a sequence where three suits have been bid asks partner to bid slam with a control in the unbid suit. Partner passes lacking first or second round diamond control, bids 5NT with the guarded @DK, trots out 6@D with the @DA and bids six spades with a singleton diamond.|mb|5s|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Bid 2@C. The 4th suit to create a force. A jump to 3@D is not forcing and bidding 3NT is bizarre. After the 4th suit, partner usually bids notrump with a stopper in that suit. The bid of the 4th suit has nothing to do with your holding in that suit. It is just a convenient way of forcing partner to bid again, particularly after having made a one level response.|mb|2c|CP|1|FP|2|AT|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|3NT is the bid.  A 2NT rebid would show a minimum type hand, typically 12-14 HCP with at least one club stopper. You are too strong to make such a discouraging rebid. Many would open this hand 1NT to avoid awkward rebidding problems.|mb|3n|
