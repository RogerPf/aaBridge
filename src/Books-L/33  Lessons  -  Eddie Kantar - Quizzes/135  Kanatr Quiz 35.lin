NT||

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Opener has six clubs, five diamonds and two hearts. The diamond rebid showed five diamonds therefore the club opening showed six clubs. With 5-5 in the minors, the proper opening bid is 1@D even if the opener has reversing values. If opener is that strong, opener can always jump shift to 3@C and then possibly rebid clubs.|
