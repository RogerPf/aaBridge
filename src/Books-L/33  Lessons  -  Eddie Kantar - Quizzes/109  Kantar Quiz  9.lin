He often took his bridge books to junior and senior high school, hiding them beneath his textbooks. One of his instructors was so impressed with his "study" habits that he mentioned it in class, causing Eddie to sweat bullets fearing the teacher would come a little closer and see "Reese on Play" superimposed over the history book he was supposed to be studying.|

ht|k|va|4|at|^B@2At the high school level many of the girls who had boyfriends in college found out that Eddie played bridge and begged him to teach them the game. He did, with high hopes in mind, but the minute they thought they knew how to play, he never heard from them again. At the University of Minnesota where he studied foreign languages (now he can enjoy bridge books written in French and Italian),  he taught bridge and sold football souvenirs to pay his tuition.

|ht|p|at|^B@2Eddie Kantar's bridge wisdom combined with his wit makes reading his popular books a learning experience (at any level) as well as a true pleasure. He is one of the best known bridge writers in the world. He has written some 25 bridge books, some available in CD-Rom form, and is also a regular contributor to the ACBL Bulletin, Bridge World, Bridge Today, and OKbridge. A two-time World Champion, Eddie is highly regarded as a player, and he competes regularly on the National level.  He is known as one of bridge's great ambassadors.

^-{   9.  A QUIZ ON LIMIT BIDS   }
^-|
CP||fp||at|^B@2^x@3
In order to better understand bridge bidding, it is important knowing which bids are limited and which bids are unlimited .

A limited bid has a specific range of high card strength, usually a three point range. For example, an opening bid of 1NT  can show 12-14, 13-15, 15-17 or 16-18 depending upon agreement. Other bids such as an opening bid of 1@H is considered unlimited because the range is so great. One can open 1@H with as few as 10 or 11 HCP or as many as 20 HCP in some cases.
  
The moment either the opener or the responder makes a limiting bid, the partner becomes the captain, at least for the moment. In the following quizzes you will be shown 8 sequences and your job is to decide which, if any, of the bids are limited  -  have a range of about 3 HCP.  Assume you are playing a standard system. |
