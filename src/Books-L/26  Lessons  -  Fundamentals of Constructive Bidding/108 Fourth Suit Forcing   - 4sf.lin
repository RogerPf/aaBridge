^-{ Fourth Suit Forcing in a Nutshell }
^-|
CP||fp||at|^C@2^Z@3With Fourth Suit Forcing you can initiate a game forcing auction while keeping the bidding at a lower level. Without it, you would be forced to gamble on game when you are uncertain of the correct strain. Fourth-suit-forcing in particular helps partners avoid bidding a doomed 3NT because neither hand contained adequate stoppers

Naturally, you may find some experts playing Fourth Suit Forcing as invitational at two level and forcing at three level. However, here a strict "game force" is adopted. The following explanation by Mr. Howard Schutzman puts the entire issue in a nutshell.

"I play 4SF unconditionally establishes a game force, whether at the 2 level or 3 level. Some do play  2 level invitational, 3 level forcing, but my feeling is there are many other sequences where you can show invitational strength, but often none where you can show game strength, so I think the unconditional game force is simpler, handles more situations, and makes much more sense."

How does Fourth-Suit-Forcing work? 

     Let us look at a common bidding situation. You are sitting South and the bidding goes:|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |

^B@2Please study your hand and decide what should you bid now?|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


at| You cannot bid 2@S because it would promise a 6-card suit.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|
Without a heart stopper bidding NT is out. |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at| You cannot bid clubs either. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|

Furthermore, with 13 HCPs you want to be in game. But which one?  It seems that you must choose between 4@S and 3NT.  But your partner may have only two spades at best and bidding 3NT with two small hearts is dangerous. Here Fourth Suit Forcing (4SF) comes to the rescue. Bid 2@H and wait for more information from the opener.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||
st||rh||ah|4th Suit Forcing|ah|a1|sv|0|md|3SAQ832H54DA32CK95,,,|mb|1dp1sp2cp2h|ah||at|
^B@2Your bid should be 2@H which is Fourth Suit Forcing (4SF). 4SF is a convention designed to deal with this challenge.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


aT|

Your 2@h bid says nothing about the suit in question. It simply establishes a "game force" and asks opener to bid again  giving further information. For example, after your  2@H partner should bid 2@S with three-card spade support or 2NT with a heart stopper. Unable to do those partner should pick a suitable bid. |

^-|FP||
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


at|
          
            The following situations are mainly when you might want to use 4SF: 
               ^DA.    You are asking whether partner has 3-card support for your  5-card major;
               ^DB.    You are interested in NT game but lacking stopper in the fourth suit;
               ^DC.    You do not have a natural bid; or
           ^DD.    You have "an opener" hand. Note again that you are the responder.|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


AT|

^C@2You may need more information on "an opener" hand. Howard suggested the following.|AT|

"Responder has to carefully evaluate his/her hand after getting the second bid from opener which is the third suit. Now, an |cp|8|at|opener|cp||at| hand is required plus other conditions for a 4SF bid. Generally speaking, using the Rule of 20 to establish whether or not a hand is an |cp|8|at|opener|cp||at| is a good methodology and will work most of the time. However, based on the auction, you may upgrade some hands where you have a particularly good fit but ostensibly only invitational values or downgrade some hands that meet the rule of 20 where you have a bad fit. 

For example, if you have a hand with heart and club support and partner bids hearts and then clubs, you might decide a hand that is just short of an opening bid is still good enough (an opener) to bid game. Similarly, on the same sort of auction, if you have a 5/5 hand with spades and diamonds that meets the rule of 20, you might be concerned about a misfit and downgrade your hand a bit." |

Lacking the 3-card support partner should bid  2N with hearts stopped". Generally speaking, when responder bids 4SF, you want to keep the bidding low, until you find out why 4SF was bid

^c @H@2Bid 2NT. With a spade stop, and easily enough for game, you could argue for a 3NT bid. In general, you should not jump to game over a 4sf bid. Partner deliberately wants to keep the bidding lower. Let his next bid tell you why he bid 4fs. Although many times, he is just looking for a NT stopper, sometimes he might be making a slam try. Here, if partner bids 3@D or 3@H over 2N, you should show some slam interest since you have 16 HCP. |

^c @H@2You may say "Responder is showing a six card spade suit with a game forcing hand, and probably no heart stopper." That is certainly likely, but really what partner is doing is showing excellent spades, and letting you choose between 3N, 4@S, and possibly trying for slam. So, with bad spades (no better than a small doubleton), you would probably bid 3N over 3@S. With some spade support, but otherwise a min hand, you would bid 4@S. And with a better than min hand, you would bid another suit, below 4@S, establishing spades as the strain, and making a slam try. |
