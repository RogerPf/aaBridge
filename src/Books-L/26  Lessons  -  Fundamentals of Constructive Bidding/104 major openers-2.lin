ht|f|AT|^o@2^Z@3This presentation is based on the fourth lesson of a five-lesson series on "Fundamentals of Constructive Bidding" by Howard Schutzman (BBO nickname "hondo717") in the BIL. You can find the original material under the "Introduction to Constructive Bidding" in the "Tutorials" section in his web site at ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge^*N. Further, he has supervised this presentation for which I am thankful.

Moreover, I would like to thank Marge DeFries (BBO nickname "mardef") for editing  these presentations.

{      Beginner Intermediate Lounge, Our Home      }
^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

In this lesson, Part 2, we will discuss the more complex auctions that result when responder does not have support.

In all of these lessons, I will assume the reader uses basic hand evaluation techniques. That is, he or she uses the standard 4-3-2-1 method for counting HCP and makes small adjustments for either shortness or length. I now teach, and prefer, the more accurate Bergen methodology, but, because it is not familiar to everyone, I will not use it in these lessons. Now, let me begin the lesson on when the responder does not have support for openers's suit.

^-|
fp||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|With support for opener's major, responder has a very simple objective -- just deciding whether or not the final contract should be game (4@H or 4@S). If you have 3 or more cards in opener's major suit, that is the suit you should play in, and it is up to you to keep the auction simple and ensure that the final contract is in that suit. You should always consider the hand categories--minimum, medium, and maximum--and the The Law of Total Tricks.|CP||

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, most of the time, when you do not have support, you will bid 1NT. This simply announces you have 6-8 points and fewer than 3 cards in opener's suit. It does not promise NT distribution.|

AT|If opener has a balanced hand (5-3-3-2, or 5-4-2-2 with scattered honors) and a minimum or medium hand, he should pass. With a 6-card major, opener should rebid it. With an unbalanced hand, partner should bid the second suit, asking you to pass with 3-card support. The one exception is that with 5 hearts and 4 spades and a minimum, opener should pass, because the auction 1H-1NT-2S is a reverse, showing a medium or maximum hand. Let us look at a few examples.

{Responding with a Medium Hand (9-11 points) and no Support}
^-|
fp||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|These are the most complicated auctions, because you, as captain, need to determine both the best strain (which suit or NT), and whether or not your side has game (if opener has a medium hand, 15-17, or maximum hand, 18+). The basic approach is for you to bid a new suit (forcing another bid from opener), and then invite or bid game based on opener's next bid. Let's look at some specific cases:|

cs|4|
Ht|i|at|^B{|ia|,1sp2cp2s|at|}|HT|h|AT|^m@2^Y@3If opener rebids the major (e.g., 1S-2C-2S), that promises a 6-card suit and minimum opening  hand (no more than 14 or 15 points). You should invite with a honor doubleton and a good medium responder hand. Otherwise, you should pass, since it is unlikely your side has game.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


HT|n|at|^B{|ia|,1hp2cp3h|at|}|HT|m|AT|^m@2^Y@3If opener jumps in the major (e.g., 1H-2C-3H), that shows a medium opening hand with a 6-card suit, so your side has game (since you also have a medium hand). It is your responsibility to make sure you get there. Because opener can jump with a six-card suit and a medium hand, a simple non-jump rebid of opener's suit shows a minimum hand. |
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


HT|r|at|^B@2^Y@3Therefore, when opener rebids his/her suit, you have a very good idea of opener's hand strength. This is not always true with other auctions. |

HT|h|AT|^m@2^Y@3and see why it promises 5 hearts.|ht|l|at|^B@2^Y@3If you, as responder, only have 4 hearts, you virtually always have a 4-card minor. You don't have 4 spades (you would have raised), so, unless you are exactly 3-4-3-3, you have to have a 4-card minor. Therefore, you bid your 4-card minor. Opener now has the opportunity to bid 2H over your minor. Therefore, requiring responder to have a 5-card heart suit in order to bid 2H makes it easier for your side to determine how many hearts there are between the two hands.|

One special circumstance is if opener opens 1H and you have 4 spades and a 5-card minor. You should bid your minor first. You will then bid your spades over opener's rebid. Since spades are a new suit, opener is forced to bid again. Bidding this way describes your distribution more precisely and makes it easier for your side to find the correct strain.|

^-|HT|e|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|On the auction 1S-P-2C-P, a reverse is not available for the opener. 3D and 3H are jump shifts, showing 18+ and forcing to game. So with a medium opening hand, opener is often forced to make a minimum rebid if he is not strong enough to jump shift. A jump shift skips a level for the suit bid;  a reverse does not skip a level for the suit bid.|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


AT|

If we change the auction slightly to|at|^J{|ia|1SP2DP3C|at|}|ht|M|at|^b@2^y@3then 3C would be a reverse (because you bypassed 2S). But 2H is not a reverse, and 3H is a jump shift. So with 16 or 17, 5 spades and 4 hearts, opener is forced to bid 2H and hope that they do not miss game when opener has 10 or so. Next, let me give you some definitions.|
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


CP|8|FP|2|AT|

a) Jump shift|CP||FP||AT| - a jump shift is skipping a level in a suit. For example, if you want to bid hearts and 1H is available to you, and you bid 2H, that is a jump shift. So, for example in the following auctions, |
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


ht|T|at|^B{|ia|1cp1dp2h|at|}   and ^n{|ia|1sp2cp3h|at|}

Opener's  rebid is a jump shift. A jump shift rebid by opener shows 18+ and establishes a game force.|

{    WHEN IS IT A REVERSE AN WHEN IS IT A JUMP SHIFT     }
^-|HT|e|fp|2|CP|8|at|^B@2^Y@3b) Reverse|CP||FP||AT| - a reverse by opener is a rebid by opener that goes voluntarily past the opener's first suit at the two level. So, for example, if you open 1C and partner responds something, and 2C is available as a bid, and you bid something higher than 2C, that is a reverse. For example, in the following auction,|
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


HT|i|at|^b{|ia|1cp1sp2h|at|}|HT|H|at|^m@2^Y@32@H is a reverse. 2C was available to opener as a rebid, and he chose not to bid 2C. A reverse, because it does take up some extra bidding room, is defined as more than a minimum opening hand, 16+ or so. It is forcing for one round. (This is very important; responder may not pass the reverse.)|
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


AT|
^B@2^Y@3Responder, with 10 or more points, is obligated to make sure their side gets to game. Similarly, if opener has a maximum, 18+, opener is responsible for making sure their side gets to game by jump shifting. When reversing, opener only promises 16+ points, so responder with a 6-count is not obligated to force to game (just obligated not to pass the initial reverse).|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|So, to summarize what to do with unbalanced maximum hands and a second suit, opener must jump shift (or reverse into spades). The jump shift establishes a game force (the reverse does not). With a minimum hand, opener rebids the suit at the 2 level (except if it is spades, in which case opener passes). And with a medium hand (somewhat rare), opener also rebids a suit at the 2 level, but can reverse into 2@S when appropriate. |
PG| ***** 138 ***** |

ELIZA42: Opener with medium hand (15-17) cannot reverse. Ask him to clarify.|
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Using standard hand evaluation methods (raw HCP plus additions for shortness), you can reverse with a medium hand. A medium hand which qualifies for a reverse contains a 5+ card suit plus a 4 card suit. Therefore, you can add at least 2 distribution points to the hand (the hand must have at least either 2 doubletons or a singleton) giving the hand enough strength to reverse.|

guyb2: When as responder you have a maximum and opener opens 1@h. What to do with 5 spades and 5 minor?|
PG| ***** 141 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|You bid 1 spade. You must force to game. If opener raises spades, you can bid game. If opener's rebid is not your second suit, you can bid your second suit to force opener to keep bidding. If you are lucky enough to have opener rebid your second suit, then you can use fourth suit forcing to force opener to keep bidding.|

qx|LAW,The Law of Total Tricks |ht|e|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|The Law of Total Tricks is a fairly easy and extremely important concept that every player should know. |
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


AT|

Simply put, the Law of Total Tricks states that you are safe in bidding to the level equal to the number of trumps you have. So, for example, if you have a 9-card fit, you are safe in bidding to the 3 level (9 tricks). Similarly, with a 10-card fit, you are safe in bidding to the 4 level (10 tricks). |
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


AT|

Notice that the Law does not mention high-card points. That is because, even if you go down, the contract is almost always a good sacrifice against whatever the opponents can make. The Law is very accurate and should be followed on all hands. Sometimes it goes against your intuition, but, in my experience, you should strictly follow the Law.|
PG| ***** 146 ***** |


AT| 

Note that the Law specifies the minimum level to which you should bid. Even with an 8-card fit, if you have enough points to bid game, you should still bid game, which is a 10-trick contract.|

During the auction, both partners should always be thinking about whether it is still possible to bid game. For example, if your partner opens and you, as responder, have a maximum (12+) hand, you should bid game. Similarly, if you open with a maximum (18+ with traditional count and 20+ with Bergen's count) and get any response from partner, you should bid game. |

^-{Full Text - Howard's Lesson}

HT|f|fp||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Y@3^*BBILManager:^*N|cp||at| Thank you very much Howard for this very educative series.|cp|8|
pg| ***** 156 ***** |


AT|^B@2^z@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at| You are welcome. guess that is my cue to get started Welcome to my fourth lesson on the Fundamentals of Constructive Bidding. The purpose of these lessons is to teach you the principles behind bidding. I have found that most students bid by memorizing the often conflicting and confusing rules about bidding. What I am trying to do in these lessons is explain the principles behind these rules so that you can figure out what to bid, rather than just relying on a set of rules.|
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


AT|

This lesson is part 2 of how to bid when your partner opens 1@H or 1@S In part 1, I talked about how to bid after 1@H or 1@S when you have 3+ card support. Remember a very important principle is "support with support." That means you should go out of your way to show partner you have support ASAP.|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


AT|

If you have 4+ card support, raise partner immediately regardless of what else you have in your hand. If you bid a new suit after partner opens a major, that denies 4-card support. If you have 3-card support and if you have a weak hand, similarly you should raise to 2. However, because unfortunately there is no good way to show 3 card support with a medium or maximum hand, you have to reluctantly bid a new suit.|
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


AT|

Notice I said reluctantly. Whenever partner opens a major and you have support, you should be disappointed when you cannot tell him the good news immediately. Unfortunately, often you do not have support for partner. This lesson is on what you do in that case. A quick note on hand evaluation. In these lessons I use the usual 4-3-2-1 method for counting high card points, with small adjustments for either shortness or length. That is a reasonable method to use when you first learn bridge. However, I strongly recommend you learn the Bergen hand evaluation method once you are comfortable with bidding. It is much more accurate.|
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


AT|

For details on that method you can go to my web site ^*Hwww.hondobridge.com^*N and look at my slam bidding lessons 1 and 2.|
PG| ***** 161 ***** |

HT|E|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|For those who have been attending these lessons, remember, as responder you have one of 3 hand types -- a minimum response contains about 6-8 points, a medium response contains about 9-11 points. and a maximum response contains 12+ points. If you have a maximum response, it is your responsibility to make sure your side gets to game. If you have a minimum response, game is possible but unlikely, unless partner has 18+. The most difficult auctions are those where you have a medium response, because then you have game if partner has 15+.|
PG| ***** 162 ***** |


AT|

So, what I am going to do in this lesson is discuss your responses to one of a major based on which type of hand you have as responder. Let's start with when you have a minimum response (6 to a bad 9 or so). This is very easy, if not very informative to your partner. Most of the time, you bid 1N over 1 of a major with a minimum response. You cannot bid a new suit, because that promises at least a medium hand. You cannot raise because you do not have 3+ card support. So, by default, you must bid 1NT. There is one exception. If partner opens 1@H, and you have a minimum hand and 4+ spades, you should bid 1@S. However, recall that, if you have a minimum hand, if you bid 1@S, you only do that with 2 or fewer hearts. With a minimum  hand and 3+ hearts, you always raise.|
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


AT|

Now, that does not mean that when the auction goes 1@H-P-1@S, opener should assume you do not have 3 hearts. He does know you do not have 4+ hearts, because, as I said before, you always raise with 4+ card support. But a response of 1@S can be made with a medium or maximum hand and 3 hearts, as responder has no way of raising right away. However, if the subsequent auction shows that responder has a minimum hand, then opener knows that responder has at most 2 hearts. So, quite often when it goes 1@H-P-1@S, responder has 2 or fewer hearts. And if he has 3 hearts, opener will find out the next time responder bids.|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


AT|

Now let's go back to the 1NT response. What does opener rebid after 1NT? I am assuming here that we are not discussing the 1NT forcing convention. If you play the 2 Over 1 Game Force System, 1NT sometimes shows a different hand than a minimum hand with 6-9. But that is beyond the scope of this lesson. For now, assume 1NT shows a minimum hand with 2 or fewer cards in support of opener's suit, and 6-9. What does opener rebid?|
PG| ***** 165 ***** |

%%%%%%%%%%%%%
HT|E|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Note that opener cannot have a medium balanced hand, because then he or she would have opened 1NT. Remember that I, and most experts, advocate opening 1NT with a balanced 15-17 even with a 5-card major. So, opener cannot have a medium balanced hand. If opener has a maximum balanced hand, he can bid 3N, or 2N with 17 or a bad 18. If opener has a six-card suit, and a minimum hand, he or she rebids it at the 2-level. With a six-card suit and a medium hand, opener can jump to 3. Note that is not forcing.|

With a six-card suit and a maximum hand, opener must show a maximum hand by either jump shifting, occasionally into a 3 card minor, or bidding 3NT or 4 of the major if the suit is good enough to play opposite a singleton. The point here is that once responder bids 1NT to one of a major, the captaincy of the hand shifts back to opener. If opener has a maximum hand, it is his or her responsibility to make sure their side gets to game. Responder has sort of "signed off" by bidding 1NT. If opener feels that 1N is not the best contract, it is her responsibility to change the contract and determine whether or not to bid game. |

So, I have now talked about what opener rebids with either a balanced hand or a 6+ card suit. With an unbalanced hand (that means another outside 4+ card suit), opener can bid a new suit. If the new suit is at the 2-level, then responder will usually either pass or, with 2-card support for opener's original major, correct back to 2 of the major. Note that with a minimum or medium hand, opener has to bid a new suit at the 2-level. If opener rebids a new suit at the 3 level, that is a jump shift, which shows a maximum hand, and establishes a game force. Again, when opener rebids a new suit at the 2-level, opener can theoretically have as much as 17 or a bad 18, but in real life usually has less.|

There is one special case I need to talk about. If it goes 1@H-P-1NT, on occasion opener will have a minimum hand with 5 hearts and 4 spades. In that case, opener cannot show a second suit at the 2-level. Why is that? Because 2@S is a reverse (a bid past the original suit at the 2-level). Also, note that because responder bid 1NT, responder cannot have 4+ spades. So, your side cannot possibly have a spade fit. Therefore, if you have a minimum hand, with 5 hearts and 4 spades, and the auction goes 1@H-1NT you should pass as opener. Of course, with 5 hearts and 4 spades and a medium or maximum hand, you can rebid 2@S as opener, since you can reverse with a medium or maximum hand.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|So, to summarize what to do with unbalanced maximum hands with a second suit, opener must jump shift (or reverse into spades). The jump shift establishes a game force (the reverse does not). With a minimum hand, opener's rebid is a new suit at the 2-level (except if it is spades, in which case opener passes). And with a medium hand (somewhat rare), opener's rebid is still a new a suit at the 2-level, but opener can reverse into 2@S when appropriate.|

Next, let's go on to what to do when you as responder have a medium hand. These are the most difficult auctions, because you, as responder and captain, need to determine both what suit to play in, and whether or not to play in game. Neither suit nor level has yet been determined. If opener has a medium or maximum hand, you want to be in game. But if opener has a minimum hand, you do not want to be in game. Similarly, you do not know which suit the hand will be played in (or if NT is best). So, what can you do?|
PG| ***** 171 ***** |


AT|
 
Well, you have to rely on the fact that a new suit by responder is forcing for one round. Therefore, you must bid a new suit with a medium hand and no support for partner. For example if partner opens 1@S, and you have 5 hearts, you can bid 2@H. Note that 2@H over 1@S guarantees a 5 card suit. This is the only new suit bid by responder that promises a 5-card suit. All other new suit auctions only promise a 4-card suit. Remember, I am talking about what to do when you as responder have a medium hand. You cannot bid 2@H with a minimum hand, even if you have 5+ hearts. With a minimum  hand, you have to bid 1NT. You can only bid a new suit at the 2-level as responder with a medium or maximum hand and if that bid is 2@H, it shows 5+ hearts.|
PG| ***** 172 ***** |


AT|

Let's take the case where partner opens 1@H, you have a medium hand, and 4 spades. In that case, you have an easy 1@S bid. Sometimes responder will bypass a 4 card spade suit but, when you have a medium hand, and 4 spades (or more), it is pretty much always right to bid 1@S. Responding to a 1@S opener, with a medium hand (no support for partner), if you have a 5-card minor (and not 5 hearts) you should bid the minor. If you have no 5 card suit, and do not have support for partner, you have to have a 4-card minor, so you bid the 4-card minor.|

HT|E|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|So, 1 major/2 minor only promises a 4-card suit. Now, those of you who are sharp may ask, what do you do if opener opens 1@S and you have exactly 4 hearts and 3 cards in all the other suits and a medium hand. |
PG| ***** 174 ***** |


AT|

None of the rules I presented apply. You can't bid 2@H as that promises 5 hearts. You can't bid a minor, because that promises a 4-card suit. Well, first of all, that case rarely happens and second of all, there is some good news anyway. You have 3-card spade support, so you know you are going to end up in spades (or occasionally hearts if opener also has 4 hearts). Therefore, in that case, you bid 2@C with a 3-card suit, and then show your 3-card spade support on the next round. Bidding 2@C with a 3-card suit will not get you into too much trouble because you will correct back to spades. |
PG| ***** 175 ***** |

Once responder bids a new suit, what are the possible rebids by opener? If opener rebids the major at the 2-level, that shows a minimum hand with a six card suit. You, as responder with a medium hand, can invite with a doubleton honor, otherwise pass. Much of the time you will pass. If opener jumps to 3 of their major, that shows a medium hand and 6+ cards in their suit. Since you have a medium hand, that is a game forcing auction. So, if the auction goes 1 major / 2 something / 3 major, that establishes a game force. Responder, by bidding a new suit at the 2-level has shown at least a medium hand. And opener, by jumping to the 3-level has shown a medium hand.|
PG| ***** 176 ***** |


AT|
 
You may recall from the the first lesson, a medium hand opposite a medium hand has enough points for game so that specific auction establishes a game force. When opener rebids their suit, you have a good idea of both their hand strength and distribution and can usually determine whether or not game should be bid. Unfortunately, opener is usually not so co-operative with their rebid. But, if opener rebids the cheapest NT (either 1 major / 2 minor / 2NT) or (1@H-1@S-1NT) you do have a good idea of what opener has --a balanced minimum, and game is unlikely, so you often pass.|
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


AT|
 
Now if opener reverses, that shows a medium hand as well and again, if you have a medium hand, your side has enough for game. If your first bid was a 2 over 1 bid (for example, 1@H-P-2@C-P-2@S), then both partners know that a game force auction has been established. That is because you, as responder, have guaranteed a medium hand with the 2@C bid and opener has guaranteed a medium hand with the 2@S reverse. Therefore, the game forcing nature of the auction is clear, and all that remains is to determine the suit. Similarly, if opener jump shifts, that also establishes a game force.|
PG| ***** 178 ***** |

HT|E|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|That leaves the difficult auction, where opener bids a new suit at the 2-level. For example, 1@H-2@C-2@D. That is a case where opener's strength is not fully defined. Many times, opener will have a minimum  hand and, if you only have a medium response, game is not likely. But, opener will on occasion have a medium hand, not strong enough to jump shift so, you with a medium hand, should keep the auction open to cater to that possibility.|
PG| ***** 179 ***** |


AT|
 
With 2-card support, you can return to 2 of opener's major. With support for opener's second suit you can raise. Otherwise, you have to bid 2NT or rebid your suit. If at all possible, however, you should bid one of opener's suits. You should only bid NT or rebid your suit if no other suitable bid is available.|
PG| ***** 180 ***** |


AT|

Though, responding with a medium hand is the toughest, with a maximum hand things are much better. You, as responder, know that you must bid game, so that issue is resolved. The only thing you have to figure out is which suit to play in. You should keep making forcing bids (new suits), until you figure out where to play. Usually, opener's rebid will clarify things, and you can figure out where to play and, you will always have a new suit available as your second rebid, in case you are not sure what to do.|
PG| ***** 181 ***** |


AT|

Therefore, if you have an opening hand opposite partner's opener, the auction is pretty straight forward. So long as you, as responder, remember to keep making forcing bids, until you get to game. The one special case I want to talk about is when partner opens 1@H and you have 4 spades and a 5-card minor. In that case, you do bypass your 4 card spade suit and bid your 5-card minor. When you later show your spades, opener will know you have a 5+ card minor, 4 spades, an opening hand, and will have a good idea what to do. May people will bid 1@S over 1@H with an opening hand and a 5-card minor but that is not correct. you should bid your minor first.|

a) Once again you have a minimum hand.
b) Game is unlikely. 
c) Also spades is possible but less likely because you have such weak spades. Remember, when partner opens 1@H, he almost never has a 5-card spade suit. So, at best you have a 4-4 spade fit. Even if opener has 4 spades. unless they are very strong, you could have as many as 3 spade losers. Therefore, I would bid 1NT with that hand, although if you chose 1@S that would be acceptable.|

c) At this point, spades, hearts and NT are all likely contracts. Clubs is possible, but you almost always prefer 3NT to 5 of a minor. You are strong enough to bid 2@C followed by 2@S. Therefore, you bid 2@C. If opener rebids 2@D or 2@H, you bid 2@S. If opener rebids 2NT, you rebid 3@S. Remember, opener cannot bid 2@S with 4 spades and a minimum  hand as that is a reverse. So, 2N by opener does not deny 4 spades. |
PG| ***** 194 ***** |


AT|

If opener bids 2@S (after opening 1@H), that makes you very happy. That establishes a game force. You want to make a slam try. If you bid 4@S that is weaker than bidding 3@S. That is because, once a game force is established, jumping to game is the weakest bid you can make. That is known as the principle of "fast arrival". Once a game force is established, if you bid to game quickly, that shows little slam interest. On this hand you should bid 3@S, not 4@S since you are in a game forcing auction, 3@S is forcing and stronger than 4@S.|

c) So, you must bid 1@S. If opener rebids 2@D, bid 3NT. If opener bid 2@H, bid 3@C (new suit is still forcing). If opener bids 2@S, you could bid 4@S. However, sometimes opener might raise to 2@S with good 3-card support. 2@S by opener tends to show 4-card support, but can be done with 3-card support. Over 2@S I would bid 3@C. Opener can then bid 3@S with 4 spades, or 3NT with diamonds and 3-card support.|
