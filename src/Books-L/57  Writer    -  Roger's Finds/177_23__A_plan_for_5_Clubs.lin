n#|3|at|I was a defender against this contract and declarer went down.   There was no real reason why he went down, except - lack of planning.  It was not even a hard plan to come up with.  So forewarned you should be able to bring the contract home without further assistance.|
n#|d|at|^^The first time you play the hand you do so without assistance from aaBridge, when set like this the hand is called a ^*b Study Deal^*n.  There is no looking at the Opps cards but you CAN ^*b UNDO ^*n as much as you like.|   
n#|9|at|^^After that you get to play the hand a 2nd time but with access to the ^*b DDS ^*n (Double Dummy Solver)  etc.|

(a)  @2Which is the master hand ?^*n|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


at|^^In this case as South has 6 trumps and North only 3, clearly South is the master hand.|

at|^^^c(c)   What techniques can we find that will reduce the number of losers, (ideally down to just 2).|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


at|^^ two @s  losers can be ruffed in Dummy.| 
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


at|^^two @d  losers can be thrown on Dummy's @hKQ.|

at|^^a @c loser can be finessed way.|

ht|f|at|^g@4@5^^|
ht|c|n#|1|
at|^^^c(d)   What problems are there for each technique (in this hand).|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


at|^^ two @s,  Opps (from bidding) must be 5-4 or 6-3 as @s's (East supported),  so 3 rnds should be no problem.| 
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


at|^^two @d,  if @h's are 4-3 (the most likely spilt) then again,  3 rounds should be no problem.|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


at|^^the  @c  finesse is  50-50  at best.  Also we can not finesse twice AND ruff the two @s's.| 
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


ht|f|at|^g@4^^|
ht|c|n#|1|
at|^^^c@2We have just done that hardest part of the plan.  We know which techniques to use to get the loser count down to 2 and so give us the 11 tricks we need^^What comes next ?|

^p they will know what to do from experience.|

ht|c|n#|1|
at|^^^c(e)  @2What is the order of play  @-  In what order are we going to play the cards ?  |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


at|^^We now know we must win with the @d Ace in dummy and then need to cross twice to hand to ruff the 2 @s's.  Looking for entries we can see the @H Ace and the @c Ace (trumps),  ruffing a 4th @h would be foolish.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


at|^^So we have @-  Win with @dA,   |fg|y|at|(continued on the next page)|fg||
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


ht|f|at|^g@4@5^^|
ht|c|n#|1|
at|^c@2^^Win with @dA,  Unblock @sA,  low @h to @hAce,  low @s ruffed,  @hKQ discarding the 2 low @d's in hand,|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


at|^^Low @c to the @cAce,    2nd low @s ruffed in dummy with the last @c.   Unless the trumps split 4-0 you are home.  All your cards are trumps in and the only have the @cKJ,  so 11 tricks must come to you.|
