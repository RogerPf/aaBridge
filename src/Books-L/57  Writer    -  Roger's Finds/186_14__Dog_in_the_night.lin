Now 

^dLet me draw your attention to curious indecent of the,   @h lead that was NOT made.

I watched this hand being played.  EW were a pick up partnership and gave no extra info on their bids (South did alert).  I have added North's range, 15-17 (as an alert) to the 1NT Opening bid.

After much thought  @-  You decide that there  IS  a chance that West has under-led the Ace of @c's, (@c's is his partners 2nd bid suit),  perhaps he knows his Kantar - 'Modern Bridge Defense'.|

Taking  South  as the master hand we have  6  losers    1@s   2@h   1@d   1@c    we need to reduce this to  3  or fewer.
BUT wait what is all that bidding by East?  And a @c not a @h lead by West and then J@d return?  Into the teeth of the visible @dAQ in dummy.   Is this all as crazy as it at first appears? 
|n#|5|at|^i By the way,  you have to find 10 tricks. . .|

at|^*bAnalysis^*n      What is East's distribution?  Why has West not lead a @h, East's first suit?  ...because he has not got one?!  So that puts East as ?6?5 shape.  A 6-0 trump split is :( so assume the spades are 5-1 putting East with  1615  shape. So he has lead his singleton @d.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


at|  So we have West as 5053 (5052 remaining).  This means that West has to follow along to (can't ruff) your top 4 @d tricks.   If you can make those 4@D's, @hA and 5@s's you have ten tricks, but how ?|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


at|^^First you have to get rid of East's supposed singleton @s (pray, it is not the Queen).      So win this lead in hand and take the @s finesse.|

at|^^We know that West has 4@d's left so we can run our 3@d tricks. We know West has 2@c's so we can ruff 2@c's (to set up a trump coup it is common to shorten your trumps).  We know that we can lead a @h towards dummy and if West ducks we will make the Ace.  |n#|5|at|^^Let's begin by clearing the @sA (as it sadly cannot ruff anything) then ruff a @c and make West think by leading a @h.|

at|If instead of discarding, West ruffs.  You duck in dummy, so in effect West will have ruffed one of your @h losers.  Say West returns at @d.  Win in dummy, ruff a @c and repeat the treatment of leading a @h.|
