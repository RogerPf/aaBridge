n#|3|at|This is a hand that I played in the  ^*h https://www.bilbridge.com/,BIL^*n  ^*b Dawn to Dusk ^*n event,  held on 2018 April 1st.   

|n^|9|at|A main theme in  Roger's Finds  is to slowly take the reader through a complex hand.  You also get to play the hand against the aaBridge bots.  The bots have been set up to give you exactly the same defense that I got at the table.

|n^|9|at|The first time you play the hand you do so without assistance from aaBridge, when set like this the hand is called a ^*b Study Deal^*n.  There is no looking at the Opps cards but you CAN ^*b UNDO ^*n as much as you like.   

|n^|9|at|After that you get to play the hand a 2nd time but with access to the ^*b DDS ^*n (Double Dummy Solver)  etc.

|ht|t|at| ^e@2 { |n#|4|at|Don't forget to read the Analysis Section (^*bAsys^*n).  That is what a ^*b Roger's Find ^*n is all about. |n^|b|at|^^ ^^}|

ht|e|at|^g When you first played a card to the @s6, you did play a HIGH @s, didn't you ? |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


n#|3|at|^^If you noticed that dummy's @s7 was enough to force the Ace - Well Done.   But shame on you if you then lazily played the @s4.| 
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


n#|3|at|^^Out of pure habit you should nurture  ANY  entry possibilities, for  'Justin'  @-  'Just in case'.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


n#|3|at|^^That is why I played the @sK and not the @s4, not a thought of an end play in my head.|

at|   We have 9 tricks.  The 10th must come from some end play.  |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


n#|7|at|^^It turns out that the 'End Play' we need is a Squeeze.
Don't be put off by the "S", word it is just a technique and like all techniques it can be learnt.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


n#|5|at|^^On the other hand, don't necessarily expect to follow along with everything the first time you see  it here today. |

ht|e|at|^g To me this position has prospects.  |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


at|Looking at the @d's, we have 6 so they have 7, which means once three rounds of @d's have been played, only ONE defender will be able to control the @d suit.|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


n#|5|at|^^So with nothing to lose we set about playing the needed three rounds of @d's.
|n#|5|at|As long as you remember to preserve the wonderful @s4 you still have a chance.|

@d back, again ruffing.  ^j Watch it happen...|

ht|e|at|^g       West has just shown 1 @h and the @dKQ10,  East has shown  1 @h and the @d972.
To me, that says, the missing @dJ is with East.|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


tt|y|
n#|4|at|^^If West (who bid 2@H) started with 6 cards in @h's we are home.  Why ?   Because West with only five cards left in her hand and putting her with 3 of them being the 3 remaining @h's means that she will then have at most 2 other cards that are not @h's.  These 2 cards can only be @c's.|

ht|e|at|^g(For those who did not show the Opps cards earlier, they are showing now.)|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


n#|4|at|^^If West has only got 2 @c's then it means that she will have NO say in the @c suit,
as once we play our @cAK, then only East can control @c's  AND  we already know that East is controlling the @d's (having the @dJ).|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


ht|f|at|^g@4@5^^|
ht|e|at|^g If you are wondering if I worked all this out at the table, the answer is NO.
I did have an inkling that such an outcome might be possible because West had bid 2 @h's, so was likely to have little space for the other suits.  
The key is that, once the Opps have taken their tricks, - there is only this one chance - so TAKE IT.|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


ht|f|at|^g@4@5^^|
lg|f|
ht|e|at|^g We still have to finish the Squeeze.
Technically for those (like me) who like names, this is an 'Inverted Automatic Squeeze' with a 'Two Part Extended Menace', which in this this case is the  @cA73  together with the  @cK94.
|n#|3|at|The @d8 is a one card Menace (it menaces the @dJ) while the combined @c holding threatens to make a trick from a third @c should East give up her guard.|
