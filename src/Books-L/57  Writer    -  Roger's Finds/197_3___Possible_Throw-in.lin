I played this hand in  4@s's, or should that be misplayed it in  4@s's.


Of the 16 tables that played it  14  South's played in  @s's  
^i and the two that made 10 tricks only did so with the aid of truly terrible defense.


Either way I am sure we can do better this time.  
^k Despite the fact we are going to be up against perfect defense.      :)

at|^^Are we in a good contract ?      Will others be playing here ?     Which hand should we pick as the Master hand ?    How many losers do we have ?    You know the drill.|    
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


n#|5|
at|^^Just from a quick glance you can see that this is a VERY marginal 24 hcp game, many will not bid it.  It is also unlikely that many will play in 3NT.   So to have any chance of a reasonable score we MUST make our 10 tricks.|  
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|n^|5|
lg|k|
at|With South as the master hand we have  5  losers    1@c(slow),  1@h(slow),  1@d(slow)   and   2@s(1 fast, 1 slow).
We need to get this down to 3.      I will leave you to count  'winners'  if that is your style.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


n#|3|
at|^^There are two obvious candidates for shedding losers  
^c@2(a)  picking the correct play to reduce the @s losers to one      and
(b)  the  @c  finesse|

at|PLEASE NOTE  -  that there should be no rush to try the @c finesse.  There maybe a chance that East can be induced to lead one for us.  The Opps do have nine of them.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


n#|3|
at|^^^*bWhat is going on in  @h's ?^*n
West's  @hQ  must be from @hQJ (at least) and she could well be leading from 5.  If so (we have 6) then East has only a doubleton.   Just something to bare in mind for later.|

at|^*bHow to deal with the trumps ?^*n 
Clearly trumps need to be pulled to stop them ruffing.
With just the  @sAQ96  out a 2-2 split is the most likely (49%) and West will have the @sA, half the time then what we need to do is lead to the King (and hope).|

at|^^Umm...  the  @h4  then the  @h10  is still consistent with East having a doubleton.  So given that we know West started with  @hQJ  and NOT the 10  then five with West becomes even more likely.|

at|We know East started with  3@s's  and at least  2@h's.  If he did indeed start with just the doubleton  @h  then he now has his remaining 8 cards as ONLY @c's and @d's.   It gets better, if he has only 3@d's then they are splitting 3-3 and we can get to our long @d with the @cA.  And if East has 4 or more @d's (likely given West started with long @h's)  then  well....  can you see it .... ?   can you .... ?|
