ht|k|n^|5|at|But what do we already know ?  West overcalled a 1@s (5+) and East supported (3+).   Were the @s 6-3 or 5-4 ?  West did not try to give East his @sAce which is enough to make it likely that West started with 6@s and so knew the next round would be ruffed.   |
at|The switch to the @c9 also makes it likely that East has both @c hons (@cKQ).|

at|^^so east started ^*b 3523 ^*m.    Meaning that East started with 5 @h to West's 2. So East is two and half times more likely (5/2) to have the @hQ than West.|

ht|k|n^|5|at|^*bYes ^*n -  clearly we could have allowed for the possibility that East's clubs were @cKQx and so should have preserved the @cJ in case it came good.  Therefore we should have started the @c ruffs with the @c6.|

ht|k|n^|5|at|There is deeper point, once we have the inkling that West could have both the @cKQ, we should have seen that East (with a 4th @c) may feel compelled to cover a low @c at trick 3.  
Look at it from Easts point of view (assuming that East started with a 4th @c).|
