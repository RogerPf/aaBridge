^c@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Hi everyone. This is my eighth and final lesson on Defense 202. It has been a pleasure giving you these lessons. I hope you have enjoyed taking them as much as I enjoyed giving them. This week, as we have done for the past 3 weeks, I will present several example hands to illustrate the defensive principles we have learned. You should review the 4 topics I covered in the first 4 weeks -- opening leads, carding, signals, and counting. If you learn everything I covered in those first 4 weeks, you will be a better defender than most. Okay, next is our first hand for this week.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bid 2S. it is clear. Despite the fact that North has a balanced hand, you should always raise partner if you can. Pass is not completely unreasonable with only 5 HCP and a balanced hand. But, North has 6 points, so pass is not reasonable. The question is, should North bid 1N, as he has no shortness, or 2S. The answer is, always raise partner if you can.  Not only does it have the advantage of supporting partner immediately, but it makes it that much harder for the opponents to come in.|

mb|p|SK|S|lb|*bWhat would you bid here?  ^^4s|mb|4S!|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|South  has a great hand. 18 HCP, a doubleton, a really nice spade suit, and nice cards in the other suits. 4S is clear cut. 2N is definitely not correct. You need to force to game. If you are playing match points, and want to try NT, although I don't recommend it, you would have to bid 3N. But 4S is much better, particularly since you have great spades and a small doubleton heart. As far as knowing what North has, North is pretty well defined--3 or 4 spades, 6-9 points.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The opening lead is pretty clear. Leading from the top of a 3 card honor sequence is very powerful. The King of hearts stands out. As a defender West is carefully evaluating the dummy. West needs to keep track of both hearts and spades. With 4 spades, it is often possible to shorten declarer's trumps such that you can set up a second spade trick for yourself.|

PG| ***** 17 ***** |


pc|H5|pc|S5|at| West was already pretty sure East started with 3 hearts but this confirms it. West should also keep track of trumps. There were 7 between West and North. Therefore, there were six between East and South. Since South opened 1S, South  had at least 5 spades to start with and East had at most 1 spade.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| The fact that East has 1 spade is very good news for West. Why is that?|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


at| Because that means South  started with only 5 spades. South  has already ruffed once meaning South  only has 3 spades left at this point. Therefore, West is sure of beating the contract. How?|

at| After West gets in with the Ace of spades, she will lead her last heart which declarer has to ruff. Therefore, West will have one more trump than South and score a small trump in addition to the Ace.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The contract is set. Many people are reluctant to lead a card that they know declarer will trump. However, that is often a good play. At worst, it will be a neutral play, as declarer can always ruff the suit himself and sometimes, particularly when you are long in trumps, you can force declarer to run out prematurely. |
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even if declarer is trumping in the short hand, it may cause declarer to prematurely use up an entry. The point is, don't be afraid to lead a suit that you know declarer is trumping. If you have a better lead, by all means make it. But, it is at worst a neutral play. And on this hand, it actually created a trump trick for the defense.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I hope most of you would open the South  hand. It meets the rule of 20. The rule of 20 being if your HCP plus length of 2 longest suits is at least 20, you should open. In this case South  has 11 HCP and has 9 cards in her 2 longest suits--spades and hearts. So, 11 + 9 = 20.|

greenie08: If vulnerable?|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


AT|
At any vulnerability. Particularly when you have a major, You should strain to open. I like to open even with a long minor, but there is a case to be made not to open marginal hands in first or second seat with only a long minor and no majors. I am a rule of 20 purist myself. You need to decide what is comfortable for you.|

mb|p|sk|n|lb|*bWhat would you bid here?  ^^3s|mb|3S!|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3S is my choice. Let us look at various answers. 2S, which only promises 6-9, is too weak a bid. 4S, which promises a weak hand, with 5 spades is not appropriate. The question is, should North force to game. If you think North should force to game then Jacoby 2N is the bid. This hand is not quite strong enough to force to game. It does have 12 HCP, but has a flat distribution. I would be content with a limit raise. But, 2N would not be unreasonable, just a tad aggressive in my opinion.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


mb|p|SK|S|lb|*bWhat would you bid here?  ^^4s|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most of you would think that South  has a clear pass, I suspect. However, Marty Bergen has an interesting rule that works quite well on these hands. Any hand with a void or singleton should raise to game after a limit raise is his rule. Also, for those of you who use Bergen hand evaluation, the hand has 11 HCP + 1 length point + 2 for singleton + 1 for 4 card heart suit once spades are supported. That gives the hand 15 Bergen Points, enough to bid game. But the singleton rule in and of itself is enough to bid game.|

FM75: Doesn't he subtract for 4 quacks?|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good question. Quacks are "Queens and Jacks" which are not worth their true value of 2 and 1. But in this case, there are 4 quacks and 2 (Aces and 10s), so not quite enough to subtract a point. If you are interested in learning about hand evaluation, my slam bidding lessons part 1 and 2 are good source to learn the method. You can down load them from my web site at|CP|1|AT| ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/^*N|CP||AT| or from the BIL library at |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bilbridge.com^*N|CP||AT|. Anyhow, I would bid 4S here.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East should play a high heart to encourage partner. That will either show the Queen (assuming Ace from Ace-King) or a doubleton. In this case, East wants to show a doubleton. Correct play is heart eight.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now East is looking at the clubs in the dummy. With only six clubs between East and North, that means there are 7 between South  and West, It is extremely unlikely that West started with 7 clubs. For one thing, West might have preempted or even opened 1C using the rule of 20, if West had AKx of hearts and QJxxxxx of clubs. It is virtually certain South  has at least 1 club. Therefore, East decides to take the setting trick and plays the club Ace next.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, it turns out if East is patient, the hand is set 2. But "it is never wrong to take the setting trick." Occasionally playing match points, where overtricks and undertricks matter, it might be. But, in general, if you can defeat a contract, do so.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The question is whether East should play high low, to encourage or not. In this case it is not such a good idea because  East has a natural trump trick. Therefore, ruffing a heart does not gain the defense a trick. Therefore, East would not like West play another heart. To that end, East should discourage by playing a low heart.|

Encourage partner when you want her to continue the suit. Discourage when you don't want the suit continued  as you noticed on this hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West has a pretty good hand once East opens 1S. Using Bergen's hand evaluation, it is close to 10 points. So, one could consider this a limit raise with three card support, and bid 3S. But, there are some negatives to the hand. The unprotected Jacks are a minus and an eight card fit is not nearly as good as a nine card fit. If I change South's hand to KQJX Jxxx x Jxxx, I would probably make a limit raise, due to the fourth trump. The difference between a 9 card fit and 8 card fit is huge.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you are deciding between a more conservative and less conservative bid. With a nine card fit, choose the less conservative bid (limit raise in this case). With an eight card fit, choose the more conservative bid. A nine card fit is worth at least half a trick compared to an eight card fit. So, here I would content myself with a 2S bid.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me explain further with SAYC and 2/1 in mind. Even if West decides to evaluate the hand as a limit raise, he should not bid 3S, because that promises 4 card spade support. In SAYC, he needs to bid 2H. In 2/1, he needs to bid a forcing 1N, followed by a jump to 3S over the opener's rebid. He should not bid 3S over 1S.|

sk|N|lb|*bWhat would you bid here?  ^^x|mb|d!|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North should get in the auction here. Remember, "if they have a fit, you have a fit."  North has a really nice takeout double here. When the auction goes 1x-p-2x, if you are short in the opponents' suit, you should strain to bid. Partner should assume you are competing, not showing a good  hand. The opponents have already shown approximately half the HCP by bidding and raising. Your side can't have more than half the deck. So, it is okay to compete in this sort of auction with shortness in their suit.|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


sk|E|lb|*bWhat would you bid here?  ^^r|mb|r!|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East has an interesting choice. East wants to compete to at least 3S. Given all of East's Aces and 2 good suits (clubs and spades), there is a small possibility that their side has 4S. Most experts play 3S here directly is just competing. In other words, they don't want to give South  a chance to bid. Therefore, East must make another bid to show a good hand. 3C or redouble are both fine here.|

sk|S|lb|*bWhat would you bid here?  ^^3d|mb|3D!|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|South  does not really want to give North a choice of what suit to play and   should bid 3D to show her best suit. This does not show extra points, merely a preference for where to play. It is similar to when the auction goes 1x-dbl-rdbl. A bid by the responder to the takeout double does not show extra values. On that auction, the first bidders have good hands and, therefore, the responder to the takeout doubler cannot possibly have a good hand. The same principle applies here. 3D is merely preference for a suit, it does not show any values.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Correct bid for North is 5D. From North's point of view 3D was great news from South. They have a nine card fit, North is short in spades, and they are not vulnerable and the opponents are. It is a perfect time to sacrifice. Even down 3 doubled is better than their making 4S.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me briefly go over the scoring.  4S vulnerable making is 620. Non-vul doubled down 1 = 100, 2 = 300, 3 = 500, 4 = 800. So, if North/South can manage to go down 3 or less, 5D is a good bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East with 3 Aces, and no real shortness, does not want to go to 5S.  East should double, suggesting that he would rather defend than play.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, I am going to play this hand with two different defenses. In general, when the opponents bid, and you have the majority of the points, they are bidding on distribution. Therefore, it is likely that they will want to cross ruff the hand to maximize their tricks. Thus, when the opponents sacrifice, a trump lead is often a good lead. Let me first play the hand out without a trump lead.|

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|lb|*bWhat would you bid here?  ^^2d|mb|2D|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North could have as many as 17 points. To jump shift North needs 18 points. Therefore, South, with 10 Bergen's Starting Points, should not consider passing. 1N is a possible bid,  but the club stopper is iffy. If North has longish diamonds, since North also has long spades, it is likely North could be short in clubs. Therefore, although 1N is a possible bid, it has two flaws.|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First, as I mentioned the club stopper is iffy. Second, the hand is a bit strong for 1N but not quite good enough for 2N. Thus, in order to encourage partner to bid again, South  might choose 2D. Partner might pass and that might indeed be the best contract. But, if partner has hearts, or a good hand, partner will take another bid.|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


mb|p|nt||sk|N|lb|*bWhat would you bid here?  ^^3h|mb|3H!|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|From North's point of view, 2D really improved his hand. It tended to deny clubs, because with clubs South might very well bid NT. So, North's singleton club looks useful. Additionally, South  could easily have five hearts in which case 4H must have plays. Finally, with 15 HCP and a singleton, North, who has already denied 18 points, should show a good hand. 2H would be too weak. |
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North would bid 2H if the @HK were a low heart. North should encourage South  to bid game if at all possible. 3H shows a pretty good hand, 16 or 17, with 3 card heart support.|
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


mb|p|sk|S|lb|*bWhat would you bid here?  ^^4h|mb|4H!|at| And South is happy to bid game.

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|NT||sk|W|lb|*CWhich card should West lead? Click the card please.^^d8^SQ3HA3CAT984D8732^|pc|D8|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because this was such a long auction, West has a lot of information about North's hand and South's hand as well based on the auction. It is clear North is short in clubs and that North has exactly 3 hearts and 4 spades. North's most likely distribution is 4-3-5-1, or possibly 4-3-6-0. Normally that might call for a trump lead, and, in fact, that might work out well. But, West is an expert defender.|
PG| ***** 140 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would not expect you to work this out, but West is pretty sure that she can beat declarer. Remember, South raised North's diamonds, therefore, because North has long diamonds, and South  has at least three. Thus, North/south have an eight card diamond fit or perhaps even a 9 card fit. They probably have an eight card heart fit which means partner has three hearts. Further, because West has four diamonds, and North/south have at least eight, partner has at most a singleton diamond.|
PG| ***** 141 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, because West has the Ace of hearts, it is likely that West can arrange at least one diamond ruff for East, and possibly two. So, the Ace of hearts, Ace of clubs, and two ruffs will set the hand. Then, an expert West would lead a diamond. BTW, a slightly less expert West would lead A of hearts and a heart because it sounds like North is short of clubs and you want to cut down on club ruffs. If you chose the Ace of hearts, I would not fault you.|
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In fact, that is the lead I would expect you to make based on these lessons. But, lets see how a diamond lead works out.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Remember, when leading something for partner to trump, the spot you lead is "suit preference." If West leads a high diamond back, that is telling East to lead the higher of the two non-trump suits back, in this case spades. If West leads a low diamond back, that asks for the lower of the non-trump suits back, a club in this case. Without the suit preference, East would have to guess which black suit to lead back. But, by following the suit preference, East knows to lead back a club for the second diamond ruff.|

Movie Maker's Note|CP||AT|: For the last eight weeks I had the pleasure of turning Howard's excellent lessons into BBO movies. I think I did an excellent job doing so--delusion is my suit! However, in this final presentation, I could not adequately represent the depth of appreciation shown by many bridge students who attended the eight weeks course. However, next, I will include the chat from Sandy which beautifully expresses them. |

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from the hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to that you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-
