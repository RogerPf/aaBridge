^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily - activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^-{        Opening Remarks        }
^-|cs||fp||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Hi everyone. Let's get started. We have finished covering the topics I wanted to cover about basic defense. If you can learn to make good opening leads, card correctly, give good signals to partner, and count, you will be a better defender than most. What I have done for the next four weeks is come up with hands showing you how to apply what you have learned or at least what I have taught :).|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT|

Each week, I will present six hands, and discuss them in detail. Today, the first four hands are mostly from Marty Bergen's material on defense. His book, Bergen For the Defense, may be a bit advanced, but it is easy to read and quite humorous. So, if you are looking for an enjoyable way to learn more about defense, I recommend it. He and I also present online lessons, and some of the hands are from those lessons. I took one or two hands from the book "25 Ways to Be a Better Defender" by Barbara Seagram.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


AT|

So, each week, the first four hands will be mostly from Bergen. The last two hands each week are real hands that I actually played on BBO. Of course, in these lessons, I will always get the defense right :). But, to be completely truthful, that was not always true at the table. The reason I mention that is I never want you to be discouraged about your bridge even the world class players make mistakes, some of them rather silly in fact. Bridge is a hard game, Be proud of your achievements. Forget your mistakes, except possibly to learn something.  Okay, enough preaching. On to the hands. Here is the first hand. For each hand, not only will I discuss the defense, but the bidding and play as well.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


CP|8|AT|

nome|CP||AT|: To give you additional practice each board is set up in a quiz format in several parts. In the first part you will be quizzed on bidding the hand. Next, you will be the declarer. In another part you will be one of the defenders. In this fashion you can practice the LEAD, CARDING, SIGNALS, and COUNTING. Finally, I have a summary of important principles Howard discussed during the play of the hand.  Let us start with the first hand. This is how I am paying for my sin!

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Some people would open 4@S. A large majority of the time, that will be the correct contract. However, you give up on slam that way. The advantage of opening 4@S is it is hard for the opponents to compete. The disadvantage is that if partner has as little as 10 or 11 points, you could miss slam. For example, if I add the Ace of diamonds to the North  hand,|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


sk|n|at| giving North  11 HCP, 6@S is a cold contract. So, most experts would open the hand 1@S. |
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT||sk|S|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Some players might want to open 2C. But, the hand is not really strong enough to do that. There are some complicated rules for when to open 2C. The simplest rule that I often use is, can I take 9 tricks with my hand. On this hand, I can count seven sure spades, and 1/2 a heart, only 7.5 tricks. Therefore, it is not close to a 2C opener in my methods.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, a couple of people asked me what I meant when I said 6@S was "cold" if North  had the @DA. "Cold" is bridge slang. A "cold" contract is either 
a) one that makes on any distribution or 
b) one that makes given the lie of the cards. 
In the case above I meant a). However, sometimes the opponents (or you) make a contract due to a lucky lie of the cards, and you console yourself by saying the contract was "cold" against any defense. |

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let us discuss what East should do. Many of you would pass, fearing the vulnerability. But that would be my last choice. You can't play "scared" bridge. To be successful at bridge you have to be aggressive but not foolhardy of course.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|There are a couple of things that make bidding attractive on this hand. First of all, it is always true, if the opponents have a fit, you have a fit. Let me explain why. For the sake of argument, let us say the opponents have a 9 card fit. That means you and your partner only have 4 cards between you in their trump suit. Also, you and your partner have 26 cards between you (each of you have 13, and there are no misdeals, at least on BBO :).|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, that means you have 22 cards (26 - 4) in the other 3 suits. Mathematically, therefore, you must have at least one 8-card suit between the two of you. Forget about the math. Just remember, "^*Bif they have a fit, we have a fit^*N."|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Second, when competing, shortness (singleton or void) in their suit is a very powerful asset. Let us first discuss a void. If you have a void, and are playing in a trump contract, then all their high cards in their suit are worthless if you get to play the hand. In fact, Marty Bergen says, if you have a void in their suit, you are playing with a 30 point deck. Keep that in mind. A void in their suit is way better than even the Ace. So, East has a singleton, not quite as good as a void, but almost.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Singletons and voids in their suit should make you aggressively. Now, finally, East also has a really powerful suit, diamonds. Basically, even opposite a singleton, it should play pretty well. Most of the time it will take five tricks. Finally, the question is, what should East bid?|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|If North  had opened 1@S, you could make a case for a takeout double, as it is possible that E/W would want to play in 4@H. However, once there is a bid and raise, chances of game are not nearly as likely. And it is also likely that, since they own spades and can outbid you, partner will be on lead and you really want partner to lead diamonds. So, 3@D is the best bid here. |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


mb|3D|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT|^B@2
margaritah: Isn't  the  3@D  bid  showing  a  poor  hand?|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|No, the 3D bid is not a preempt. It just shows diamonds. The idea behind a preempt is to get in the opponents way. Here, the opponents already have made two bids, so 3D is not really getting in their way. Besides, there is no point in preempting, since the reward of preempting of making it hard to bid does not apply.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


sk|S|lb|*bPlease choose your bid.  ^^4s|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let's look at South's hand again. Some of you who only count HCP will say, "well South  has 16 HCP" and North  has no more than nine and game is not likely. But, that is not true. South's hand is extremely powerful, and also N/S are known to have at least a 10 card fit--North  was showing three spades, and South  has seven, for a total of 10 spades at a minimum.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Anyhow, first of all, South knows they have a 10 card fit and there is an important bidding principle known as "the law of total tricks"--LOTT for short. The law of total tricks says, if you count the number of trumps you have, you can bid to a contract for that number of tricks. If for example, if you know you have a 9-card fit, you should bid to the three level, since that is a nine trick contract. Similarly, here, because you know you have a 10 card fit, you should bid to the four level, a 10 trick contract.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|The law is a very easy competitive tool. and it works really well. For example, most of you know if partner opens 1@H and you have 5 hearts, you are supposed to bid 4@H regardless of how many points you have. That is again an application of LOTT. You know you have at least a 10 card fit, so contracting for 10 tricks is right. On this hand, South  also has very good cards and expects to make 4 spades most of the time.|

^-|cs||cp||fp||at|
^b@2Let us review the important points we have learned from the last two hands.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


at|

There are some complicated rules for when to open 2C. The simplest rule that I often use is, can I take nine tricks with my hand.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


AT|

You can't play "scared" bridge. To be successful at bridge you have to be aggressive but not foolhardy of course.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


AT|

If the opponents have a fit, you have a fit. For the sake of argument, let us say the opponents have a 9-card fit. That means you and your partner only have four cards between you in their trump suit. Also, you and your partner have 26 cards between you (each of you have 13).|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


AT| Therefore, in the remaining 22 cards you must have at least one eight-card fit.

When competing, shortness (singleton or void) in their suit is a very powerful asset. Let us first discuss a void. If you have a void, and are playing in a trump contract, then all their high cards in their suit are worthless if you get to play the hand. In fact, Marty Bergen says, if you have a void in their suit, you are playing with a 30 point deck. |
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


AT|

There is an important bidding principle known as "the law of total tricks"--LOTT for short. The law of total tricks says, if you count the number of trumps you have, you can bid to a contract for that number of tricks.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


AT|

Lead partner's suit, my most important rule on defense.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


AT|

In third seat, usually it is best to play the lowest card from touching sequences--Queen from AKQ.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


AT|

Right after the opening lead try to count the distribution of at least the relevant suit.|

Signal whenever relevant. Attitude first, count next. Signals are not demands. When signaling, do it as strongly  possible.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|West has a very clear cut lead. Remember, leading the top of an honor sequence is a very powerful lead. The @HK is the correct lead. No other lead is even close. In NT, this shows at least the KQJ or KQ10. In a suit, the K only guarantees the Q, but in NT you must have a three card sequence or broken 2.5 card sequence (e.g. KQJ or KQ10).|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|South had enough of this and has to take the trick with Ace. Now let us have a good look at the dummy and figure out how to set the contract. West knows that South needs almost all the diamond tricks from the dummy. Further, West has the diamond Ace as the gate-keeper. South has to go through West to get the tricks and West has the Ace.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Let us think and find out what West needs to know. Now, in this particular hand, East must really help West out. West needs to know when to take the diamond Ace. There are no entries to the board, so West wants South to be out of diamonds when she takes her Ace--so South cannot get back to the dummy with another diamond. Therefore, East needs to tell West how many diamonds she has. Right now, West can count nine diamonds between his/her hand, the dummy, and the one played by declarer. Therefore, there are four left between South and East. If East has two, South has two left. If East has three, South  has one left.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|East must signal count. If you remember, you play  "^*Bhigh low^*N" to show a doubleton and "low high" to show three. Thus, in this case East plays the @D8 which is high, showing two or one. Let us go through the next trick.|

So, by East giving West count, West knew how many times to duck a diamond. You might be thinking, why shouldn't West duck 2 diamonds regardless. The next hand will show you why. Next, you will have a chance to play this hand double dummy and experiment with different plays. Let us finish the hand.|

That way declarer will be limited to the least number of tricks to which she is entitled.|

mb|p|SK|S|lb|*bPlease choose your bid.  ^^1s|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|South  with five spades, has a clear 1@S "balance bid." A "balance bid" is a bid made in the pass out seat. In this case, if South  passed, then West buys the contract for 1@H. It is rarely right to let the opponents play at the one level. So, South  should strain to make some sort of bid. In this case, South has a good hand, so 1@S is easy.|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|But even with seven or eight points, and five spades, South  should bid 1@S. Some teachers say South can "borrow" three points from North when in the balancing seat. But, another way to look at it is this. West did not open 2c. East passed showing less than six points. So, at a minimum, North and South  have at least 17 or so, and likely at least half the deck. The less points South  has, the more points it is likely North  has.|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|It is quite possible North  did not have a convenient bid over 1H. And also, North  did not know that East was going to pass. So, making an aggressive bid with North  is somewhat dangerous. But, once East passes, being aggressive with South is not dangerous  because South  now knows that N/S have a fair number of points between them.  |
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


mb|1S|SK|W|lb|*bPlease choose your bid.  ^^p|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|West has nothing more to say. Does not have a sixth heart, or more than a minimum hand, so pass is correct. Each bid should provide more information. Passing says West has a minimum opening bid with five hearts.|

mb|p|SK|N|lb|*bPlease choose your bid.  ^^2h|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|North  has an interesting bid, if you play it. Many people play a "cue bid" (bid in the opponents suit--2H) in a competitive auction shows support for partner's suit and 10+ points and that is what North  has--three spades and 10 points. I personally play a cue bid guarantees four card-support. I would bid something else with the North  hand, but many people play you can cue bid with three-card support. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|West has to do some counting. West saw nine hearts originally between her hand and dummy--West had five, North  had four. So, East and South  have four between them. Since since East played a high heart, East probably was starting a high low and has two hearts which means South also has two. Further, West knows that if South draws trumps, he can set up the @HQ for a discard and West would like to prevent that. Since West has the Ace of spades, she can do it.|
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|The trick is arrange so that partner ruff the two hearts in dummy, thereby preventing any discards by South--even though South can over ruff. Otherwise, South  would clear all the trumps and would be able to throw a club loser on the last heart. Therefore, the defensive plan is to prevent a heart discard, and hope that E/W have one trick in either clubs or diamonds. Let us go along with the plan. So, West plays a small heart next.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|One bidding rule to remember is "^*BNEVER PREEMPT A PREEMP^*Nt." So, 3S here is not a preempt. Once the opponents open a preempt, there is no point in your preempting, because your side likely has the majority of points. Thus, a jump bid like this shows a solid six-card plus suit and a good hand. Some people would bid 2S. But, since 3S is available to show a solid suit and a good hand, 3S is more descriptive. But, those who would bid 2S, that is fine.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|West is going to take stock. If East had the AQJ of hearts, he probably would have overtaken, in case the King was singleton. Further, if East did not have  109 etc. it should not discard the Jack as a signal. If East did not have the 109, perhaps would play the eight. Therefore, East must have the Ace but not the Queen. West also knows East has six hearts, because East opened a Weak-2. West had two and North had two. So, 6 + 2 + 2 = 10, leaving three hearts for South. This counting stuff is very important :).|
PG| ***** 187 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|In fact, West knows South started with Qxx of hearts. So, West can see a sure set, if West is careful.  West can see two heart tricks, the Ace of spades and a heart ruff if he plays his cards right. However, dummy also only has heart left. Further, except for the Ace, West cannot overruff dummy. Therefore, West has to remove dummy's trump before playing a second heart to make sure West can ruff the third heart and not be overruffed. So he should play the spade Ace first.|
