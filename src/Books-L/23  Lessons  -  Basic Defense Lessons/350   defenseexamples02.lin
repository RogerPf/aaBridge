^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|This is my sixth lesson on defense 202. It will be similar in format to last week's lesson, as will be weeks seven and eight. The first four weeks I gave you the fundamentals of defense--opening leads, carding, signaling, and counting. I suggest you keep reviewing those principles as they are essential to your becoming a good defender. |
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|

The last four weeks I am giving you example hands each week to illustrate how to apply the fundamentals. The hands are taken from a variety of sources. Many of them are from ^*IBergen for the Defense^*N. The book is a little advanced for beginners, but it is easy to read and entertaining so I recommend it. Some of the hands are taken from the online lessons I help Marty Bergen with and a couple of the hands are from the Barbara Seagram book "^*I25 Ways to Become a Better Defender^*N." I am neutral about that book, don't recommend or not recommend it. And two of the hands each week, if I have time, are from actual hands I played on BBO.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |

Okay, let's get started with our first hand. For each hand, I will discuss the bidding, declarer play, and defense, as appropriate.|

cP|8|at|^B@2Movie Maker|CP||AT|: Generally, It is not much fun to just watch the action with all hands open. I like to be able to think, analyze and participate in the action. Therefore, as before I have set up the boards so we can place our bets before the horses are out of the gates. The hands would be in a closed format. However, please do not peak before you give the answer even if you know how to open each or all of the hands.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The first two bids are pretty straight forward and the correct bid here is 1NT. Let us discuss the 1N rebid a bit more. Some of you might be nervous that you have no club stopper and therefore bid 2D. However, the 1N rebid does not promise stoppers in the unbid suits. It merely says opener has a balanced hand, typically with only one doubleton, although occasionally with two and 12-14 HCP. |
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is a very descriptive bid, and should be made whenever possible. Here it is clear. Some people would not do it if they did not have spades stopped, but, as I said, my feeling is, if you have the correct distribution and HCP, you should bid it.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let me discuss the concept of the "captain" of the hand. On every auction, one person is the captain and the other is the subordinate. The captain is the one who takes charge of the auction, deciding how high to go and what to play in. The subordinate mostly just answers the captain's questions. On most hands, responder is the captain. That means, responder is ultimately responsible for getting to the correct contract. For example, on this hand, once South opens, North is the captain.

sk|N|lb|*bPlease choose your bid.  ^^3n|MB|3n|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And North, with an opening hand, is responsible for making sure their side gets to game. Looking at his hand, North figures the most likely games are either 4H or 3N. Once South opens 1D and does not raise hearts, it is clear to bid 3N. Do not bid 2N, that is invitational, and is asking South a question. South can pass 2N, unless she has a good 13 or 14. So, remember North is responsible for getting the side to game, as captain.|

pg| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's look at what's going on from East's perspective. How can East plan to defeat the contract. East is pretty sure that West has the Ace of clubs. It is possible that South ducked, but with the Queen in dummy that is not as likely. So, for the moment East can assume West has the Ace of clubs. That is two tricks for the defense. East can also see that if she can get West to lead hearts, they will take three heart tricks. |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|How did East arrived at that conclusion. Just look at the dummy's heart holding. If the heart led from West he can get three tricks. But, if he leads the heart the defense gets only two hearts. Okay, let us see if East is an expert player.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


at||lb|*CPlease choose the card East should lead to give the defense the three heart tricks. ^^hk^HAKJ^|pc|hK|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us analyze why heart king is the proper choice. If East just plays back a club right away, West will not necessarily know what to do next. A spade could be right, as could a heart. In fact, since South is known to have fewer than 4 spades (remember South bid 1N over 1H, not 1S, a spade is probably a better bet. So, East would like to make it clear to West what to do.

PG| ***** 26 ***** |

pg| ***** 27 ***** |


sk|W|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When this wins the trick, West will know East must have the Ace of hearts because first of all East would never lead that without the Ace. And second, if South had the Ace, with the heart Queen in dummy, South would take the Ace of hearts. Therefore, East is telling West what to lead back after getting in with the Ace of clubs. Remember, always help out your partner on defense what you can.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have one partner who is very exasperating. He never signals. He says he does not want to tell the declarer anything but he expects me to figure out what he has. Well sometimes I do and sometimes I don't. Remember, good defenders always help their partners out. Don't worry about tipping off declarer. Declarer knows what she has anyway. But, each defender does not know what the other has.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here East made it clear how the defense is to go. I know on opening lead you lead Ace from AK. However, in the middle of the hand, you should lead K from AK. When the King wins it makes it clear you have the Ace. Some experts lead Ace from AK in the middle of the hand but the King is correct, as it provides much more information.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, if West makes a mistake, East has done everything he can at least. Also, by leading the 9 of clubs, it is clear East does not have the 10, because East would not lead 9 from 109. So, the important point here is to help your partner out on defense when you can.  But West is another expert player and knows what to do next.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here North South are playing 2 over 1. That means, unlike SAYC, 1N is forcing, South cannot pass. 1N forcing has a lot of advantages. I don't recommend you play it until you get some experience, but once you get your bidding fundamentals down, 2 over 1 is a better system than SAYC. Almost all experienced players play 2 over 1. Even in SAYC, South might bid 2D. But, if playing 2 over 1, it is required that South does not pass.|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In the first week, we went over when it is right to lead a trump and, I said, if declarer has bid 2 suits, and responder favors one of the suits, that implies responder is likely to be short in the other suit. That is particularly true if you, as leader, are long in opener's other suit. On this auction, you can just about bet that North has a singleton or void in spades. Why is that?|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With a doubleton spade, unless North had 5 diamonds, or at least a solid 4-card suit, North would return to 2S. West also has a lot of spades, and does not want spades ruffed in dummy. So, a trump lead makes sense here. However, first, let us assume West was not thinking much, and makes the natural lead, which is a heart. Normally, the Queen from QJ10 is a very powerful lead and a majority of players would make it, even on this hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is another play, which comes up on occasion. East knows West has QJ at least and likely QJ10 or QJ9. With a doubleton King, on the lead of the Queen East should unblock the King. This tells West East started with either Kx or a singleton King.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


sk|S|pc|HA|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, lets see how South can come to 8 tricks. Outside of trumps, South has one club and the one heart she just took. So, South needs six trump tricks. If she can ruff twice in dummy, she will take two trumps in dummy and four in her hand. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand illustrates the concept of "tempo." The defense has few advantages. One of its main advantages is the opening lead that gives the defense the advantage of being able to strike the first blow for their side. It is not always right to make an aggressive lead, but when you do, you gain what is known as a "tempo" on declarer. In this case, leading a trump allowed the defense to be able to lead two trumps. Not leading a trump as the opening lead lost a tempo for the defense, and they could only lead 1 trump. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1NT bid is pretty clear with 16 HCP and balanced hand. Remember, the lack of a spade stopper is not a deterrent. Any time you hold a hand with no more than one doubleton and 15-17 HCP, open 1N. It is an extremely descriptive bid. In fact, a majority of experts agree you should open 1N with a balanced 15-17 even with a 5 card major although there is some controversy about that. I strongly fall into the camp of, open 1N whenever I can, even with a 5 card major.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Again on this hand, North is the captain. North has a really good idea what South has, and can often just place the contract and even if she can't place the contract, by asking South some small questions, she will know what the correct contract is within one or two rounds of bidding. In this case, with 11 points, North knows they must be in game. With no 4-card major, and a balanced hand, 3N is very likely to be the best  contract.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now lets do some planning as South. Let's ignore spades for the moment. South can count three clubs and three diamonds for sure. And, once the heart Ace is knocked out, can count three heart tricks. So, nine tricks are there, assuming E/W don't take more than three spade tricks.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


pc|S3|SK|E|nt||lb|*CIf you were East what card would you play and why? ^^s2^SAJ92^|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's look at East's perspective. Most players tend to lead fourth best. The seven is somewhat of a high card though. So, it could be top of nothing. But, if it is, then South has the Q108 of spades and the defense is cooked in spades. However, let's be an optimist and assume it is  fourth best.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In that case, we are in great shape. The only three cards higher than the seven are the Q, 10, and 8. And if that is fourth best, West has to have all of those cards which means that South has no spades higher than the seven. For those of you familiar with the "^*Brule of 11^*N", you can use it to figure out the same thing.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The rule of 11 applies when partner leads fourth best. It says, "subtract what partner leads from 11." Whatever answer you come up with is the number of cards in your hand, dummy, and declarer that are higher than the card led. In this case, you subtract seven from 11 and get four. That means, you, dummy, and declarer collectively have four cards higher than the seven. You have three cards higher than the seven and dummy has one card higher than the seven. Therefore, declarer has no cards higher than the seven. |
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Thus, East can afford to play the two of spades, and be certain, assuming the seven is fourth best, that the seven will win the trick.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, South would have no good bid over a 1D response. A 1N rebid would show 12-14 and South has 15 and a jump to 2NT would show 18 or 19. Please remember, don't worry about stoppers. Just open any balanced hand with 15-17 HCP 1N. So, let us go back to 1NT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||sk||at|Would have been nice if West was a mind reader and led a club but, the Queen of spades is the obvious lead from West's hand. This happens quite frequently. According to the guidelines I have you for opening leads you should lead the top of an honor sequence. The guideline does not always work. But, they give you the best percentage of finding the best opening leads. Some people like to look for the spectacular opening lead.|

PG| ***** 108 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In NT, leading length in general is better than strength. But if you have a mediocre 5 card suit, and a 4 card suit with the honors, the 4 card suit is probably a better lead. In suit contracts, leading the top of an honor sequence is a very strong lead; length does not matter because your low cards will be trumped.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Back to spectacular opening leads. So, people who look for spectacular opening leads tell you how brilliant they are but they fail to mention that for every success, their spectacular opening leads fail four or five times. Therefore, my philosophy is use the fundamentals. They greatly increase the probability that you will be successful in the long run. That is true in most sports and competitive endeavors. The people who are the most successful are those who apply the fundamentals. For the next several tricks let us only look at East's hand. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now remember, East should play attitude unless count is obvious. We have seen the diamond situation before. West is going to look at the card played by East to see how many times to duck. West sees nine diamonds between his hand and dummy. So, South and East have four diamonds between them. And, actually, South has to have at least two, since South opened 1N. So East has at most two.|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


pc|D4|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, the two of diamond is missing. It is possible that East started with two. It is also possible that South started with J92 of diamonds and East had a singleton diamond.|
pg| ***** 113 ***** |


pc|D9|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Based on his count, West should duck again. Unlike last week, this duck probably makes no difference. With two Kings on the board, there is probably an entry to run the diamonds anyway. Last week, dummy had no outside entries, so knowing how many times to duck the Ace was very important. But this week, it will not likely make any difference at this stage.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, East is going to help partner hoping they can defeat the contract. The hearts and clubs in the dummy are identical. However, East wants to signal West for a club lead if West ever gets in--East almost is certain that West has the Ace of diamond. So, East is going to discard club Queen as a sledge hammer signal.|

pc|CT|nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, should East signal clubs? Let's analyze it for a second. On the last hand, East had 5 clubs (@CAQJT9) and could count five tricks for the defense even if she signaled a high club--@CQ. Therefore after, throwing a club, East had four clubs left (@CAJT9). Therefore, East could count four club tricks and the Ace of diamonds for down one. On this hand, if East throws a high club, then the defense will only take three clubs and the Ace of diamonds. Let us play it that way for now.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, East cannot afford to throw a high club to signal. So what shall he do?|
PG| ***** 140 ***** |


AT| Easy, East can signal with a low heart to discourage that suit and hope partner will lead a club. It is obviously better if East could make a positive signal--a high club. But in this case that is not possible because he cannot afford discarding a high cub. Now let us go back and let East play a low heart which most likely will set the contract. Again, look at the dummy and recall the importance of the card East played on the first trick.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, a smart West will know that playing another spade probably does not make sense. Partner signaled with a low spade on the first trick which assured that South has the King of spades. East also signaled a low heart. So, West can assume South has the Ace of hearts. If West leads a spade, then the contract is guaranteed to make. South already has three tricks. In addition, he will take three diamonds, four hearts and a spade which will give him more that he needs to make the contract. So, a club lead is in order.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On most hands, particularly in NT, you tend to signal with low cards rather than high cards because signaling high cards tends to give up tricks. The low card means you don't like the suit. In suit contracts, on the other hand, you often can signal a high card when you like that suit because length does not matter in suits, as declarer will tend to be able to trump our suit after the second or third round typically. |
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This example is more typical of how you signal in NT in real life. Some people play a complicated system of suit preference known as Lavinthal discards, particularly in NT. But, I do not particularly like that system. I don't want to get into it here, but if someone has a question about it, feel free to email me, and I will explain how it works and why I don't like it.|
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I recommend that your signals be in the suits that you discard--low in a suit means you don't like the suit, high means you do like the suit you discarded. That is the easiest and most effective way to signal.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from the hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to that you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-
