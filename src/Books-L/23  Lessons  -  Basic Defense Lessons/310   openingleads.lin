1. Partner's suit|CP||AT| – one of my cardinal rules is always lead your partner's suit. You never lose the post mortem by leading partner's suit. There are occasional exceptions, but they are very rare. Therefore, if you always lead your partner's suit, you will come out way ahead. Plus, just as importantly, you will build partnership trust. If I do not lead partner's suit, partner can assume I have a void. |

Next, let me give some examples. Assume you have this  @S ?? @H ??? @D ???? @C ???? (the actual cards do not matter for this example). Your hand's distributions is two spades, three hearts, four diamonds, and four clubs. In the following examples we will use the same hand with different auctions.

^-|HT|g|cp|8|AT|^C@2^Y@3^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am trying to give you simple but effective guidelines. And I have found leading unbid suits, in the long run, tends to work out well on more hands than not. You may come back to me and tell me on a specific hand, leading an unbid suit did not work out and I will not be surprised. However, I will be surprised if you tell me it rarely works out.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


AT|

I would like to clarify something here. If the opponents make an artificial bid, such as a transfer, or an artificial 2@C strong opener, they are not really showing the suit they bid. For example, if it goes 1N-P-2D (xfr)-P-2H. A diamond is a perfectly good lead because the 2D bidder did not show diamonds. So, when I said don't lead suits the opponents bid, I meant don't lead suits in which they have shown strength and length. If they make some conventional bid, in which the suit bid does not show strength or length in that suit, then leading that suit is fine.|

|CP|8|AT|Away from an unprotected honor|CP||AT| (except for longest suit in no trump). An unprotected honor is defined as an honor that is not part of a sequence. For example, if you have Kxxx or Qxxx or even Q10xxx, those are all "unprotected" honors. A protected honor is one that is part of a sequence, such as KQJx or QJ10x. Protected honors are very safe, as they establish tricks, whereas unprotected honor leads are not safe, as they often give away tricks. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


AT|

|CP|8|AT|Away from an Ace in a suit contract.|CP||AT| It is almost never right to lead an unprotected Ace. As noted above, an unprotected honor is one that is not part of a sequence, so an unprotected Ace is an Ace in a suit where you do not hold the king. If you never lead an unprotected Ace, you will come out way ahead in the long run. Other instances related to leading away from the Ace are outlined later. In the rare case where you decide you must lead the suit, you should lead the Ace. If you lead low, partner should assume you don't have the Ace.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

In no trump|CP||AT|, it is often right to lead away from an Ace, and that is perfectly acceptable. The idea in no trump is to establish your suit by getting rid of the stoppers that declarer has. By picking a long suit, it is more likely that declarer is short in that suit, and has fewer stoppers. |

qx|A5a,When to Lead Trumps|HT|E|FP|1|cs|1|CP|4|at|^-
{        When to Lead Trumps        }
^-|CS|6|CP||fp||AT|^C@2^Y@3You should lead a trump when you have reason to believe dummy (or declarer) is short in one of their partner's suits, particularly if you are long in that suit. If declarer bids 2 suits, and dummy shows a preference, it is likely that dummy is short in the other of declarer's suits. On those sorts of auctions, a trump lead should be seriously considered. For example, assume the following auction:

As North a club lead might very well be your best lead, particularly if you are long in hearts or spades. |

{|ia|1SP2CP2HP2NP3HPPP|at|}|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


AT|
^C@2^Y@3In this auction, declarer showed at least 5 hearts and 5 spades. And responder showed a preference for hearts over spades (if responder preferred spades, he would have bid 3S over 3 hearts). Therefore, responder is shorter in spades than in hearts, and also has no more than 3 hearts (if responder had 4 hearts, he would have raised 2H to 3H immediately). A heart lead by North rates to work well, because you are trying to get rid of as many of responder's trumps as possible and prevent declarer from using them to trump his spade losers. |

In no trump, you should only lead top from a 3 card honor sequence or broken honor sequence (K from KQJ or KQ10, Q from QJ10 or QJ9, J from J109 or J108). Never lead an honor that is not the top of a sequence (for example, if you hold J 7 6, lead the 6, not the J). Some people think you should lead J if it is partner's suit, but that is incorrect. Some people lead K from AK, but that is not common practice any more.|

{    What to Lead from Three Small - Not Partner's Suit   }
^-|CS|6|CP||fp||AT|^C@2^Y@3Everyone agrees that if you have a 3 card suit with an honor, you should lead low. There is no universal agreement, however, on what to lead from 3 small. Each of the 3 choices has its advocates.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


AT|

• Many experts prefer to lead low from 3 small. That gives partner count ("count" here means how many cards you have in the suit) and allows him to differentiate between between the leader having a doubleton or three. |
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


AT|

• On BBO, the most popular treatment is to lead high from three small. That tells partner you have no honor in the suit. |
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


AT|

• A few people advocate leading the middle card (for example, they lead the 6 from 8 6 4). The second time the suit is played, you play the high card (the 8 in this example). This is known as "Middle Up Down" or MUD for short. As far as I am concerned, this is the worst choice of the 3, as your opening lead is often ambiguous. You need to take a stand, leading low if you think count is more important, and leading high if you think denying an honor is more important. |
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT||
HT|E|FP|1|cs|1|CP|4|at|^-
{     What to Lead from Three Small - Partner's Suit     }
^-|CS|6|CP||fp||AT|^C@2^Y@3The above discussion assumes you are not leading partner's suit. When leading partner's suit, the rules are somewhat different: |
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


AT|

• If you have not supported partner's suit, lead low from 3 small. It is almost always more important for partner to know your count (how many cards you have in the suit) rather than whether or not you have an honor. Partner can often work out where all the honors are, but it is harder for him to determine whether or not you have a doubleton if you lead high from 3 small. |
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


AT|

• If you have supported partner's suit, then he knows you have at least 3. Therefore, you should lead low from 3 to an honor, and high from 3 small. Since he already knows you don't have a doubleton, you might as well provide the additional information about whether or not you have an honor. |
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


AT|

• When you have the Ace in partner's suit, the situation is a bit ambiguous in a suit contract. It is still dangerous to lead a suit in which you have an unprotected Ace, but less so than in a suit which partner has not bid. If you have another attractive lead, I would think about leading that suit, rather than leading an unprotected Ace, even in partner's suit. In a no trump contract, you should still lead the suit, as leading away from an unprotected Ace is not as dangerous, because your Ace will not get trumped. |
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


AT|

If you choose to lead the suit and have Ax, always lead the Ace to show two. If you have three or more to the Ace and choose to lead the suit, do the following. In a suit contract, lead the Ace (remember, you never lead away from an Ace in a suit contract). In a no trump contract, lead low when you hold 3 or more to the Ace in partner's suit.

^k@2^z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||fp||at|My preference would be the 8 of hearts. It seems like the most passive lead, the lead least likely to give away a trick. Some people would want to lead a spade.

HT|s|va|2|AT|^k@2^z@3If you lead a spade, you have to lead the Ace, since you cannot lead away from an Ace in a suit contract. As I said above, leading unprotected Aces is rarely right, which is what steered me away from a spade lead.|

HT|v|AT|^C@2^z@3
The Queen of diamonds is not likely to be right, since your opponent bid diamonds. Some people think that leading through dummy's strength is a good opening lead, but my experience has been that it usually doesn't work out well to lead a suit that the opponents have bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Thank you very much Phillip for your kind words. Welcome everyone to the first of my 8 week course on defense. This course will be in 2 parts. The first 4 weeks will be mostly lecture and examples and the last 4 weeks will be practice hands. This week's topic is opening leads. The topics for the 3 weeks after that are:
Week 2 - Defensive Carding
Week 3- Defensive Signals
Week 4 - Counting|
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


AT|

Defense is the most difficult part of bridge. Even the experts make lots of defensive errors. What I hope to do here is give you a good grounding of the fundamentals of defense. You should not expect to play perfect defense but, if you learn the fundamentals, you will do much better on average than most of your peers.|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


AT|

Opening leads in particular are very difficult. It is an important defensive tool, and can often make the difference between a contract making or being set. What I am going to do is give you guidelines for making good opening leads. If you follow these guidelines, you will do better than most. There are occasional hands where an unorthodox brilliant lead beats an otherwise unbeatable contract and there are many player who look for these brilliant leads, (and usually fail).|
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


AT|

My advice is to stick to the basics. If you execute the fundamentals better than your peers, you will do better in the long run.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As many of you know, I work closely with Marty Bergen who is one of the best bridge players in the US. He told me, on hands where the opening lead matters, and it is not obvious, he is happy if he gets half of them right. If Marty Bergen only gets half right, then we can feel good if we get half right.|
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


AT|

There are basically 2 considerations when considering your opening lead. The first and more important is which suit. Once you pick the suit, then you have to decide which card in that suit.|
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


AT|

Let me give you some general guidelines about which suits to lead. There are few absolute rules in bridge. But, this first principle is one of two cardinal principles that I always obey
and that is, ALWAYS LEAD YOUR PARTNER'S SUIT.|
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


AT|

Most of the time it will be right, or at least not wrong
and, more importantly, it builds partnership trust. My partners know, if I don't lead their suit, I probably have a void
and, as I tell my partners, if you lead my suit, you can never lose the post mortem :). It might not be right on the hand, but is right for the partnership. I have followed this rule for many years, and I assure you I have come out ahead in the long run. So, that is my first and most important rule.|
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


AT|

The second order of preference in choosing a suit is to choose an unbid suit. Some people think that if someone opens one of a minor, it's okay to lead the minor, because sometimes opener is short. That is not true. If someone opens one of a minor, 85% or more of the time they have four plus cards in the suit. And even if they only have three cards, they usually have honors. So, avoid leading any suits that the opponents have bid. This is not an absolute rule, but it is a very good guideline. |

^-|CP||FP||cp|8|AT|^C@2^Y@3
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Against NT contracts, my preference is to lead my longest unbid suit. I prefer length over strength. The longer my suit, the more likely in NT I am going to set up my low cards. If I own two unbid suits of the same length, then I pick the stronger one. So, the old "4th from longest and strongest" rule does work well. Some people say you should prefer to lead an unbid major and there is some merit to that, in that modern bidding tends to focus on bidding major over minors. So, failure to bid a major means that it is less likely that the opponents have that major. However, I still prefer to lead my longest and strongest suit, even if it is a minor.|
PG| ***** 172 ***** |


AT|

If it is close to a tie in terms of which suit to lead, then I will lead the major. But, that is only when it is close to a tie. Otherwise I pick my longest and strongest suit. Obviously, I was talking about if partner has not bid. Remember your first obligation is to lead partner's suit if partner has bid a suit.|
PG| ***** 173 ***** |


AT|

The next thing to consider are honor sequences, particularly against suit contracts. If you have 2 or more touching honors in an unbid suit, that is often a good lead. I will go over later which card to lead, but honor sequences tend to be strong leads in unbid suits.|
PG| ***** 174 ***** |


AT|

Another good lead is trumps. I will discuss specifically when trumps are a good lead in a few minutes. However "when in doubt, lead trumps" is not a good rule in general. I will clarify it in a few minutes.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Finally, another good lead is a singleton.

To summarize, in order of preference:
1) LEAD PARTNER"S SUIT
2) lead an unbid suit
3) lead longest and strongest unbid suit in NT
4) lead suits with an honor sequence
5) lead trumps on some hands
6) lead a singleton|

Let me give some examples. Assume you have the following distribution (the actual cards do not matter for this example)
@S ?? @H ??? @D ???? @C ????. Meaning, you have two spades, three hearts, four diamonds, and four clubs. Say the auction goes 1C-1S-double-P-2C-P-2H-P-P-P. In this auction, your partner overcalled 1@S. In this case it is obviously clear to lead a spade.|
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


AT|

Let's take a different auction. Again, remember you have two spades, three hearts, four diamonds, and four clubs. The auction is 1C-p-1D-p-1N-p-3N-all pass. In this case, lead a heart, the longest unbid suit. Even if you have honors in clubs or diamonds, avoid leading them. Perhaps if you had KQJ10 in a minor you might lead it. But, in general avoid leading suits that the opponents have bid.|
PG| ***** 178 ***** |


AT|

Here is 1C-P-1D-P-1H-P-2N-P-P-P auction. Here you should lead a spade. Partner rates to have five plus spades since neither opponent bid spades. There are exceptions to not leading a spade, but for now, just stick to unbid suits.|

^-|CP||FP||cp|8|AT|^C@2^Y@3
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am trying to give you simple but effective guidelines. And I have found leading unbid suits, in the long run, tends to work out well on more hands than not. You may come back to me and tell me on a specific hand, leading an unbid suit did not work out and I will not be surprised. However, I will be surprised if you tell me it rarely works out.|
PG| ***** 180 ***** |


AT|

I would like to clarify something here. If the opponents make an artificial bid, such as a transfer, or an artificial 2@C strong opener, they are not really showing the suit they bid. For example, if it goes 1N-P-2D (xfr)-P-2H. A diamond is a perfectly good lead because the 2D bidder did not show diamonds. So, when I said don't lead suits the opponents bid, I meant don't lead suits in which they have shown strength and length. If they make some conventional bid, in which the suit bid does not show strength or length in that suit, then leading that suit is fine.|
PG| ***** 181 ***** |


AT|

The final auction is 1C-P-1D-P-1H-P-3H-All pass. This is a prime candidate for a trump lead. You have length in the opponents suits and it sounds like each may be short in the other's suit. Therefore, here a trump lead (heart) would be called for. We will discuss this further shortly.|
PG| ***** 182 ***** |


AT|

Now, let's discuss which suits to avoid. First, as I said, avoid leading suits which the opponents have bid naturally. Second, leading away from an unprotected honor is often a bad lead. An "unprotected honor" is an honor that is not part of a sequence. So, a suit just as Kxxx and Qxxx contain unprotected honors. Leading those suits often gives away a trick, particularly in suit contracts. In NT contracts, you should not worry as much about leading away from unprotected honors in long suits, because you are trying to set up low cards. But, in suit contracts, you cannot set up low cards in your suits, because your opponent will probably be able to trump low cards. So, leading away from an unprotected honor in a suit contract should be avoided if possible (unless of course partner bid the suit).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is another important rule that many less experienced players find hard to follow. This in regard to suits with unprotected Aces. Remember, an unprotected Ace is  when you don't have a sequence (e.g. the AK). Thus, in a suit where you don't have the A and K together, in a suit contract, don't lead that suit. First of all, you should never lead away from an Ace in a suit contract. If you lead a low card in a suit contract, partner should assume you cannot have the Ace. If you absolutely feel you have to lead the suit, then lead the Ace.|

Leading an Ace to "see what is going on" is a very bad idea. If you never lead an unprotected Ace for the rest of your bridge career, you will come out way ahead. Aces are made to capture other honors. Again, if partner bid the suit, it is ok to lead the Ace. And in NT, it is often good to lead away from an Ace. However, in suit contracts, avoid leading suits with unprotected Aces if partner has not bid the suit.|

Finally, and many people find this surprising, a doubleton is usually not a good lead. You rarely have the opportunity to set up a ruff for yourself. A singleton is a very strong lead
but a doubleton is a very weak lead.|
PG| ***** 186 ***** |

To summarize suits to avoid:
a) suits that opponents have bid naturally
b) away from unprotected honors in suit contracts (assuming partner has not bid the suit)
c) unprotected Aces or away from Aces in suit contracts (again assuming partner has not bid the suit)
d) leading doubletons|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is time to talk about when to lead trumps. You generally should lead trumps when you believe dummy or declarer is short in one of their partner's suit, and will be using trumps to trump losers in that suit. A common example is when declarer bids 2 suits, and responder supports one of those suits. It often means responder is short in the other of declarer's suit.|
PG| ***** 188 ***** |


AT|

Let me give an example. Suppose the auction is as follows: 1H-P-1S-P-2C-P-3C-P-P-P. On this contract, declarer has bid hearts and clubs, and partner has raised clubs, not hearts dummy is probably short in hearts, and since declarer has at least 5 hearts (remember declarer opened 1H), she will be trumping hearts in dummy. SO, a club lead is called for. This is a very common sort of auction when declarer shows 2 suits, and dummy takes a clear preference, a trump lead is usually a good lead. One more time; a good time to lead trumps is when declarer is 2 suited and responder has shown a preference.|
PG| ***** 189 ***** |

I got a question about what about if you have an honor in the trump suit.For example, the worst holding I can have when leading a trump is Qxx. That gets complicated. It is quite possible leading a trump will give up a trick. But, not leading a trump might also give up a trick. I would say in general, it is okay to lead a trump from Kxx or Axx, but not from Qxx or Jxx.|
PG| ***** 190 ***** |


AT|

Let's finish with what card to lead. The strongest lead you can make is from an honor sequence, particularly a 3 card sequence. You lead the top of the honor sequence. In suits, it is ok to lead from a 2 card honor sequence. Lead A from AKxx, K from KQxx, Q from QJxx, J from J10xx. In NT, however, you should only lead from a 3 card honor sequence or broken sequence. Lead  K from KQJ or KQ10, Q from QJ10 or QJ9, and J from J109 or J108. The reason it is ok to lead from a 2 card sequence in suits is, it is unlikely you have more than one or two tricks in a non-trump suit. But, in NT, you are hoping to establish tricks, so you hope partner has something to fill in for you if you only have a 2 card sequence.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, with an unprotected honor, if you choose to lead the suit, lead low (assuming you don't have a doubleton). From Jxx, if you choose to lead the suit (for example, partner bid it), lead low. Some people think you should lead an honor if you have it in partner's suit. But, that is not correct. Remember, you want your honor to capture one of the opponent's honors.|
PG| ***** 192 ***** |


AT|

On the other hand, you should lead low from three to an honor in partner's suit. Lead low from Kxx, Qxx or Jxx. Note that a few people lead K from AK, but that is not common practice any more.|
PG| ***** 193 ***** |


AT|

If leading a suit without an honor sequence, lead 4th best from an unprotected honor. Also lead low from 3 to an honor, as previously discussed, whether or not it is in partner's suit and lead high from a doubleton. You always lead "high-low" to show a doubleton. You you should avoid leading a doubleton, but if you think it is the right suit, lead high, even if you have an honor.|
PG| ***** 194 ***** |


AT|

Now, let's discuss what to lead from 3 small. Remember lead low from three to an honor. From three small, there is not general agreement. It comes down to the following tradeoff. Would you rather have partner know you don't have an honor, or that you don't have a doubleton. Most experts, who like to count hands out, prefer low from 3 small. However, most people on BBO prefer high from three small.|
PG| ***** 195 ***** |


AT|

As I said, if you lead low, then partner knows you do not have a doubleton because if you have a doubleton you lead high. However, if you also lead high from 3 small, then partner does not know whether you have two or three. But, as was said, on BBO, the preference is to lead high from three small. |
PG| ***** 196 ***** |


AT|

That may be okay because most people don't count out hands and it doesn't really help them to know you have three. But, it does help them to know you don't have an honor. So, on BBO leading high from three small is probably better (although I personally play low when playing with expert partners).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people lead the middle card from three. That is called MUD for "Middle Up Down." I think that is not a very good approach partner often can't tell if the middle card is high or low so you get the worst of both worlds. Either agree to lead high, to deny an honor, or to lead low, to show count, but don't pick middle.|
PG| ***** 198 ***** |


AT|

Now if leading partner's suit, there is an exception. If you have supported partner;s suit, then it is okay to lead high from three small to show him you don't have an honor. But, if you have not supported partner's suit, then it is more important for partner to know how many you have then whether or not you have an honor. Partner has honors, and dummy may have some honors and partner can often work out where the honors are. But, it is nice for partner to know how many you started with, so he can figure out how many declarer has, and discard appropriately.|
PG| ***** 199 ***** |


AT|

Therefore, if you have not supported partner's suit and have 3 small, lead low. But, other than that, lead high (if you either have supported partner or are leading an unbid suit).

This concludes this week's session.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.
