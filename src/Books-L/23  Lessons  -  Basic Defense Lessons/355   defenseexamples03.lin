qx|A3,Opening Remarks|HT|e|cp|8|at|^b@2^Z@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Hi everyone.  Welcome to week seven of my eight week class on Defense 202. As we have done the previous two weeks, this week I will present several hands that illustrate how to apply the basic defensive principles I have taught you. Remember to review your notes from the first four weeks. I will be covering examples for all the topics I covered--opening leads, carding, signaling, and counting. If you learn the fundamentals that I presented for those four topics, you will be a way above average defender. Let's get started with our first hand.  |

PG| ***** 4 ***** |


at|

^*BWhich Suit to Lead (in order of preference).^*N
Always lead your partner's suit. If you do not lead partner's suit, partner can assume you have a void.   
Unbid suit. 
Longest suit, (against NT contracts--fourth best).
Suits with an honor sequence
Trump
Singleton. You should either have a trump trick or good reason to believe partner may have the Ace or a trump trick.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


AT|

^*BWhich Suit Leads to Avoid^*N
Opponents' suits.
Away from an unprotected honor,(except for longest suit in no trump).
Away from an Ace in a suit contract. In the rare case where you decide you must lead the suit, you should lead the Ace. In no trump, it is often right to lead away from an Ace.
Doubletons (except in partner's suit or trump).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some of you might hesitate to overcall 2H with the South's hand. Your suit is not that great. However, it is rarely dangerous to overcall a six card suit. And most aggressive experts would not hesitate to bid 2H.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, North has few things to consider. The good news is, North has a great hand with heart support. The only bad feature of North's hand is the spade suit. In general, it is better on offense to have cards in suits other than the opponent's suit. The reason for that is that you are better off if your high cards fit with partner. Since East opened spades, it is less likely North's spades will fit with partner. So that is a negative feature of North's hand. |
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In fact, having the Ace of spades would be better than having the King-Queen. North should discount her spades somewhat, however, the rest of her hand is magnificent. She has good 3-card heart support, a very nice 5 card-club suit, and a singleton diamond which are all terrific features. So North has a clear 4H bid. |
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me point out that when you have values in an opponent's suit, they are not nearly as useful as if they are in partner's suit. If I gave North KQ10x of diamonds and a singleton spade, for example, same number of points, but then slam would be very possible. Therefore, you should upgrade points in your suits, downgrade points in the opponents suits.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's look at the hand from South's perspective. It looks like there are only two losers, a heart and a spade. With six spades between North and South , South is a bit worried about a spade ruff but has to hope for the best. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although I am not a big fan of false cards, in this case, dropping the Jack cannot hurt.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


pc|SJ|sk|E|nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's see what East should be thinking about. First of all lets look at the spade suit again, as almost always, it comes down to counting. There are 10 spades between East and dummy to start with. Therefore, there are only three spades between South   and West and those 3 spades are the 5, 7, and Jack. Since if West had the 7 and 5 of spades, West would have led the 7 (high from a doubleton). Because West led the 5, East knows West had a singleton spade, despite South 's false card. South  has to have the 7 of spades. Thus, East can give her partner a ruff.|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|An overeager East would be very excited and gives West a ruff right away. But let's see what happens if she does that.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you see South makes the contract. However, let's go back to the end of the first trick and see if East can be a little smarter.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


at||up|21|sk|E|rh||ah|Board 1A|sc||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We are back to the end of first trick before declarer has to play. East should realize that even with a ruff, she can only count 3 tricks, Ace of spades, Ace of hearts, and a spade ruff. That is not enough to beat the contract as we already tried that. So, where can the defense get a fourth trick. The singleton club combined with the Ace of hearts is very powerful for the defense. East has control of the heart suit, so she can maneuver a club ruff. Once she figures out that she can give West a spade ruff, she can see a way to defeat the contract.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


pc|SJ|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, if she leads a club right away, then after West gets a spade ruff, West can then give East a club ruff. Therefore, East needs a little patience. East must lead a club first rather than immediately giving West a spade ruff. This plan works only if North/South  don't have a 10 card fit and then West has at least 2 trumps, so West can get a spade ruff on the second round of hearts.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Two of spades is a suit preference for clubs. If East wanted a diamond back, would have led the nine of spades asking for the higher non-trump suit. By leading the two of spades back, East is asking for the lower of the non-trump suits--clubs.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here, let me briefly discuss the 2H bid. That is what is known as a "reverse" and shows a strong hand. Reverse is when you voluntarily  bid past your suit at the 2 level (on this hand bid past 2 diamonds). It shows at least 16 points. |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |

at| South  is guaranteeing at least 16 points. It is forcing one round. North cannot pass and if North has 10 or more points, then North must make sure that their side gets to game. Reverses are probably the most complicated bidding concept there is. So, if you don't understand what I just said, don't worry too much about it. Many otherwise pretty good players don't understand reverses either. However, trust me when I say that 2H shows a strong hand and it also shows five plus diamonds and four hearts.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


mb|p|sk|N|NT||lb|*bWhat should North bid?^^3d|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North cannot pass, so takes a preference to diamonds, since South  has to have at least five diamonds on this auction. 
|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


mb|3D|mb|p|sk|S|lb|*bWhat should South bid now?^^3n|nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A timid South would pass, with only 16 HCP. But with two very good suits (hearts and diamonds), the hand is worth a lot more than 16. It is closer to a 19 point hand than a 16 point hand. For those of you who use Marty Bergen's hand evaluation techniques, it in fact does evaluate to 19. So, most expert South  would bid an optimistic 3N and hope for the best. If you chose to pass, that would not be terrible, just conservative :).|

taxlady: Why not open 1NT with 16 points?|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good question. The distribution is not correct (2 doubletons) and a reverse is available to better show the hand. However, some people would indeed open an off shape 1N.|

PG| ***** 57 ***** |


pc|C5|pc|C9|pc|CK|pc|CA|sk|S|at|  Let's look at the hand from South's perspective. There are four diamond tricks, once the Ace is out. There are two club tricks, since the Jack knocks out the Queen and the 10 is then good. And finally there are two spade tricks for the total of eight. If South  can manage and steal one heart trick, she will take nine tricks and make the contract. So, let's start on diamonds
|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


pc|D7|pc|D5|pc|DT|sk|E|lb|*CWhich diamond should East play? click the card please.^^da^dA932^|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here, there is no reason to duck the Ace of diamonds. Because, East listened to the bidding. East knows that South started with five diamonds at least, and there were three in dummy. Therefore, West must have a singleton diamond, since North/south have an 8 card diamond fit and East started with four. So far West knows that South has (???) spades-four heart-five diamond and (???) clubs. Again, if you pay attention to the bidding, there are lots of things you can figure out about the hand. |
PG| ***** 60 ***** |

pg| ***** 61 ***** |


nt||lb|*CEast decided to return a club but which one should he choose?^^c4^C42^|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Correct, there is no reason not to lead a club back. In general, if partner starts a suit on defense, you should lead it back, unless you have a good reason not to. In this case, there is no good reason. Since South  bid hearts, a heart does not seem like a good play. Also, remember, East should lead back her "remaining count" in clubs. That means, with a doubleton, East should lead the 4 rather than the 2, to show a doubleton. That helps West count out the club suit.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


pc|C4|pc|C7|sk|W|nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, West has to do some counting and map out the clubs distribution. Initially, West and North had 8 clubs. So, West knows that East and South started with 5 clubs between them. They each showed one on the first trick. Therefore, before this trick there were 3 clubs left--7, 4 and 2. Now East played the four and South the seven. Who has club 2?  East could have started with K42 or K2|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once East leads back club 4 it assures East that South started with two clubs and just used his second club. Why? Because, East is supposed to lead back high from remaining doubleton and four can only be high from K42 after the king was played--East should lead back 2 from K2 and 4 from K42. This kind counting and carding is extremely important if you want to play good defense. If East had carelessly led back the 2, then West would assume that East started with K2.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West has no entries and knows that North is entitled to one club trick. So, West has to hope that East has another club left and can get in and lead a club back to beat the contract. Therefore, West must duck this trick. If West does not duck, that is the last trick West will take and the contract makes.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now South  also knows what is going on, but hopes to steal a heart trick, and take 9 tricks.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


pc|H5|sk|E|at| the spot light is on East now. |
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|An East who followed Howard's ^*Bsecond hand low^*N rule blindly, would play low quickly and hands the contract to the declarer on a silver platter as Declarer needs only one trick from the heart suit. However, there was a second part to ^*Bsecond hand low^*N and that was, it is okay to play high if you can take the setting trick.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, a smart East has figured out the club suit. Partner led five--fourth best--then the three. Therefore, West must started with five clubs because with four clubs he would lead the three. So, East correctly figured out that the defense will take 3 club tricks because partner must have three club winners left. Those combined with the already taken the diamond Ace, and the heart Ace sets the contract. Thus, East is allowed to play high, since that is the "setting" trick.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Again, counting and carding were very important on this hand. I know this stuff seems hard, but the first thing to do is to at least card correctly. Make sure you lead fourth best. Make sure you lead back remaining count. Once you get used to the mechanics, and you can count on your partner to do the same, the defense will get much easier. Defense is not easy, but without proper technique, it is virtually impossible. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First let's look at South 's perspective. This contract looks pretty easy if spades break 2-1. South will lose two hearts and one diamond. For now he is losing the first heart trick.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let's look at the hand from West's perspective once the first heart trick is over.|sk|W|
pg| ***** 96 ***** |


at| Notice East played a high card. From West's perspective, the nine is encouraging. It either shows a high card, or a doubleton. In this case, since West can see all the high cards, it shows a doubleton. That means that South also started with a doubleton because West sees 9 hearts between he and dummy, leaving 4 for East and South. So, they each have two based on pard's signal, (assuming pard does not have a singleton). In any case, a second heart is safe.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West notes that there are no more heart tricks for the defense. What can he do now? The clubs are ominous. West better cash the diamond before South  throws away his diamonds on the clubs.|
PG| ***** 98 ***** |


pc|DA|pc|DQ|pc|D3|pc|DT|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now West is pondering how could the defense get another trick. The only possibility is in spades. If East has the Ace or King of spades then they have a trick. Wishful thinking, however, in this case it turns out "^*Bthe 8 is enough^*N." Let us do some analysis for West. since West is pretty sure N/S have a 10 card fit, based on the auction, East must have one spade exactly which most likely (West hopes) is the spade eight.|
PG| ***** 99 ***** |


at|  Why is ^*Bthe eight^*N a good spade for East to have you may ask.|
PG| ***** 100 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Simple. The J109 of spades are in dummy. If West can get East to ruff a heart with the (hopefully) eight of spades, then South  will be forced to overruff with a higher spade. Since the J109 are in dummy, that means South  has to use the Ace or King of spades to overruff--declarer does not have any card higher in his hand. That means that West's Queen of spades will become good. |
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, there is another consideration. The first thing West must do is make sure East ruffs. So, West must lead a low heart. if West leads the Queen of hearts, East would have no reason to ruff. Let's see how that works out.|
pg| ***** 102 ***** |


pc|H3|pc|HJ|sk|E|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Back to East. East may figure that South has the Queen of hearts since West did not lead the Queen. In any case, East is going to ruff. No reason not to.|
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


pc|S8|NT||sk||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Declarer is hopeless now. If he does not trump the defense gets the setting trick.|
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


pc|c5|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if to win the trick he has to use either the Ace or the King which promotes the West's spade Queen. Let us do that.|

mc|9|sc|Y|at| That play is known as an "uppercut" for those of you who want to learn the terminology. Frankly, I don't care if you know what a play is called. I just think it is important that you understand it. But, an uppercut is where one defender plays a high trump and forces declarer to play a higher trump, thereby setting up a trump trick for partner|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would not hate it if South bid 1N instead of 2D, but most would bid 2D. Now, one misconception that some people have is that 2D is forcing. That is not true. 2D can absolutely be passed. A new suit by responder is absolutely forcing. So as long as responder keeps introducing new suits, opener cannot pass. However, a non-jump new suit by opener is not forcing. The only way for opener to force is to either reverse or jump shift. In order to jump shift South needs at least a good 18 points.|

mb|p|sk|N|lb|*bNorth needs you help to bid. ^^3d|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|After 2D bid  North should only pass with a 6-8 point hand. In this case, North has 10 and a diamond fit so 3D is the perfect bid. It is invitational, not game forcing. With a min hand South could pass. It also gives South the ability to bid 3S with 3 card support.|
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


mb|3D|mb|p|sk|S|mb|3N|at| In this case, South is an optimist like me, and bids 3N, which is a bit pushy. Pass would be reasonable by South as well.|

NT||sb|W|SB|S|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's see what South should do. South can count three clubs and two diamonds an one spade. If South  can manage three heart tricks, the contract will make. There is really no other way to make. Even if South  manages to take four diamond tricks, that would only be 8 tricks--four diamonds, three clubs, and a spade. So, musts play hearts.|
pg| ***** 126 ***** |


SB|W|SB|S|pc|H2|sk|W|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Before playing a heart, West is going to analyze the bidding and the first trick. From the Ace of clubs on the first trick, West can figure out South must have started with the AKQ of clubs. Why is that? Because East would play his highest club. If East had the A, K, or Q of clubs that's what East would have played. Therefore the AKQ of clubs must be in South's hand.|
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also, let's use some of our counting lesson as well. From the bidding West knows that South has at least five hearts and at least four diamonds. Bingo, West figured out 12 of South's cards--five H + four D + three C = 12. Therefore, at best South has one spade. With that knowledge, an expert West, knowing South has at most one spade, will win with heart King and play the King of spades, in case South's spade is a singleton Queen.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from the hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to that you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-
