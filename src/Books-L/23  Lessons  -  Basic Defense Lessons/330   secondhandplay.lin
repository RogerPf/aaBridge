One of the most common defensive errors less experienced players make is to not train themselves to play second hand low smoothly and quickly. There are few exceptions to this rule. The main exception you should keep in mind is that it is ok to play second hand high to win the trick when it is the setting trick (or your side can cash the setting tricks). But other than that, if you always play second hand low smoothly, it will gain you far more tricks than it will lose you. So it is very important that you train yourself to smoothly duck when you are second hand to a trick.|

QX|A2,When second hand plays before the dummy|cs|1|ht|B|FP|2|cp|4|AT|^-{  WHEN SECOND HAND PLAYS BEFORE THE DUMMY  }
^-|cp||CS||FP||at|^b@2
The primary objective for second hand is to cover an honor led by declarer to promote some secondary card or cards for either himself or the partner. Therefore, second hand should not cover if such mission cannot be accomplished. |
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


AT|

In the examples coming next the second hand is sitting West. In most instances the contract is not relevant. Further, it is assumed that declarer has no entry problem and the ruffing is not a concern. BTW, for our purpose your hand is open but declarer and your partner cannot see it and in many instances the play of cards may not follow the standard pattern.|

The main purpose of covering an honor with an honor is to promote a card either in partner's or in your hand. Here, the dummy has all the cards which possibly can be promoted.|pc|h2|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So, if you cover the heart Jack declarer would make four heart tricks with no problem--has all the promotable cards. So, West should play low and hope for a miracle. Please note declarer does not know you have the queen. But he will know as soon as the @HJ goes around and holds.|

Now let us change the cards in the dummy.|

Now you cover the honor. There is a good possibility that East has the @H9 and could be promoted.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


md|0,0,0,h9564|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So, in absence of additional information West can cover. On the other hand if there was enough information from the bidding or the previous play, if any, that South has the last three hearts covering would not generate any promotion. |
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Let us look at another example.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||
%%%Board 3
md|1hj,hq432,hakt87,|RH||ah|Board 3|pc|hj|lb|*CWhich card should West play?^^h2^hq432^|pc|h2|at|^b@2 
It does not make any difference what card West plays. The cards are stacked against East/West. Declarer can take five hearts with no problem. Even if East had the @H9, East would need three hearts in order for the 9 to be promoted--length factor.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So, what is the point. How can West decide. The answer lies in the estimate of ^*Ipartner's length^*N. Cover if you suspect partner has length in the suit. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Next we can look at promotion in our own hand. Again, we sit West and the same conditions as before.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |

pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt||pc|hq|lb|*CWhich card should West play? Cover or not cover? Click that card on the right.^^h2^hk762^|pc|h2|at|^b@2
No reason to cover. West would have no hope to make a heart trick by covering. On the other hand, the Ace in dummy would be out after three rounds. West has enough ^*Ilength^*N—staying power which gives hope to get a trick in hearts.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Therefore, if you have length of your own or suspect partner has length do not cover except for the following situations where dummy has Ace doubleton and West has King doubleton.|

It is no brainer. West has to cover. If not declarer's Queen wins the trick and all declarer has to do is from hand lead a small card toward the Ace and capture the King. Further it is possible that the original heart holdings are as follows.|

NT||lb|*CWhich card should West play? Click that card on the right.^^h4^hq74^|NT|^B@2
There is a fairly common situation. Declarer is missing the queen and can finesse either opponent for it. But he has no idea which opponent to finesse. So he will try to have the defense help him by leading an honor from his hand, hoping that an inexperienced defender—not one of us of course—will cover with the queen, thereby eliminating the guess.|PC|h4|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||
%% b7x
MD|hkj93,hq74,hat8,h652|RH||ah|Board 7x|pc|hj|at|^B@2
If West covers the @HJ, South will take all the heart tricks, since West conveniently told him where the @HQ was located. But if West plays low smoothly, most declarers will assume that East must have the @HQ (otherwise West would have at least hesitated). He will therefore win the @HA in dummy and finesse East for the HQ, thereby losing a heart trick that he would  not have lost against a less experienced defender.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I am sure you have noticed something interesting about the lead of an honor by the declarer. Yes, you guessed right. Declarer led an honor and dummy had an honor directly below the one that was led. If West thinks as most declarers do, it would be apparent that when declarer leads an honor and dummy does not have the honor immediately below then declarer must have that honor. |
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT|^B@2
For example if declarer leads a Jack he has a ten to back it up. And if declarer leads a Queen then has the Jack. Let us look at a few examples where West should look for a card below the one declarer played in the dummy. He should consider declarer has it if not in the dummy.|

From the lead of Queen West expects the declarer holding the Jack and is familiar with the rule of covering the last equal honor and plays low. "By recent count 4,857,432 tricks were lost last year when West covered in similar situations."|

I also, learned from Howard how to set a No-Trump contract either by ducking my Ace long enough so declarer cannot use the tricks in dummy--when declarer runs out of entries to dummy--or help my partner to do so. We only can do that if we have an accurate count. |

UP||nt|^b@2
This is really a judgement call. For one, declarer probably would play the King anyhow. In that case playing low is best particularly if East has the Ace.

PG| ***** 207 ***** |


NT|^B@2
East correctly deduct that West started with five spades - Rule 11. Further, you may ask why South took the trick with King instead of the Jack. That is a good question. However, it would make no difference because East is a very smart player. East already counted out the hand and figureed out that South started with a doubleton @SK and West should have @SQ 10 8.|
PG| ***** 208 ***** |


NT|^B@2
After winning the second trick, declarer clears the diamonds. Eventually, has to cross to the dummy with a heart to test the clubs. South really hopes that East has the club Ace and would follow the rule and play low. Thus declarer can make his/her ninth trick.|

Certainly you will not play the Jack, for this would be a purposeless waste of a possibly valuable card, as the Dummy will probably play the King anyway. Your choice, then, rests between the Ace and the five. If you play the Ace, the Dummy will play a small card and Declarer's Queen will be promoted to rank with Dummy's King and command the suit.|pc|h5|

However, the Declarer cannot see all four hands! With both the Ace and Ten missing, he will probably lead his five with the intention of playing Dummy's Jack.|

Here Second Hand (West) is in a finessing position when the Declarer leads the five. You, as West, must play your nine. The play of either the King or the Jack merely simplifies the Declarer's playing act, it will place for him all the missing honors in your hand. By playing the nine you may induce the Declarer to finesse Dummy's Queen on the first round, thereby making your King-Jack worth 1 sure trick.|PC|D9|

Here it is advisable, when West is Second Hand, to play for the certainty of making 1 trick. If Declarer leads low you, as West, should play the Jack, which forces the Ace and leaves you with a sure third round winner. Notice carefully the difference between this and the preceding situations. Here the play of the Jack is right because of the threatening Ten in the Dummy.|PC|DJ|

Now it would be dangerous for West to play the Jack, as the chances are against the Declarer's holding @d K 10 9 4. The danger in playing the Jack lies in the fact that to do so might conceivably force Dummy's Ace and drop Partner's singleton King.|PC|D7|

Put it another way, with the Dummy holding @dA 8 3 2, the chances are pretty good that Partner holds either the King or the Ten, and to play low will force Dummy's Ace just as surely as to play the Jack and is much safer.|PC|d7|

pg| ***** 270 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Your only hope is that the Declarer will consider the possibility too remote that you have Queen-Jack and do not play one of them, and will simply, as a matter of safety first, go up with the Ace, hoping that the suit will ultimately break to his advantage. You see, to play the Jack here, flaunting it in the face of Dummy's powerful holding, will give away the whole situation. |

If Declarer leads the @S6, and you play the Queen, it will hold the trick. But the next time spades are led the Declarer will be able to lead a small card from Dummy and finesse through your Partner's King, rendering it worthless. By playing low on the first trick, you let Partner win with his King while you still retain your Queen as a certain winner for the third round.|PC|S5|

Here the decision is easy to reach. If Declarer leads the Queen, you must of course cover with the King, which assures you of 2 tricks in hearts. Against this you have the objection that if the Declarer knows much about Bridge he will not lead the Queen, for it is the height of folly to attempt such a finesse--as you already know.|PC|HK|

You certainly hesitate about covering that Queen with your King, for Dummy's Ace will surely win. But to cling to the King will do you no good, for if the Declarer also holds the Jack and Ten, he will continue to lead hearts until your King is caught eventually.|

It is much better to |cp|8|at|"cover an honor with an honor"|cp||at|, forcing the Dummy's Ace in the hope that Partner may have the Jack or Ten, which will be promptly promoted.

If West plays low on Declarer's Queen lead, and then does the same on the Jack, Declarer must eventually catch both King and Ten on the third round. Thus Declarer makes 4 heart tricks. |

But if West covers the Queen on the first round, the Ace goes up, the Jack wins the second round, and Partner's Ten wins the third round. |PC|HK|

NT|^B@2
In this example, if you, as West, lack that nine-spot with your King, you should reconsider covering an honor with an honor especially against a good player. Any Declarer acquainted with the rudiments of the game will not lead the Queen unless he holds a lower honor with it. |

If you, as West, cover with your King, Dummy's Ace will win and then Declarer will lead a low card from this hand. If East plays the eight, Declarer can finesse his nine and catch the Ten with the Jack. |
PG| ***** 284 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Consequently, when you hold the King and the Ten or the nine, you should not hesitate to cover; but without one of these cards, you must weigh the issue. This does not mean that you should fail to cover the Jack if it is led subsequently, for then your only hope is that Partner holds the Ten and that your play of the King will establish a trick.|PC|D2|

Here if you cover Declarer's Jack lead with your Queen, your Queen has been successfully "found" and captured. If you do not cover, the Declarer who (not being clairvoyant) was probably just probing, like as not will go up with the King and finesse against your Partner instead.|

Covering is just what he wanted you to do to save himself a guess. The Jack lead should always be covered with Second Hand's Queen whenever it is apparent that, by not covering, Second Hand is establishing a tenace in the Dummy against the Defending Side.|PC|C7|

By covering the Jack with the Queen, you force out Dummy's Ace, leaving you with the eight, which can be played before Dummy's Ten, thus making Partner's King-nine a perfect tenace over the Dummy. Carrying the principle further, sometimes Second Hand must cover even a Ten to try to establish a tenace position in Partner's hand.|PC|DQ|

Still another problem is when to cover honors with honors when intermediate honors are missing, such as a Jack with a King, or a Ten with a King. The same principle holds true. If Dummy holds but one high honor, to cover is generally futile. |

The Declarer is thereby held to 1 spade trick, as the Ten is the only card which can make. If you play low on the Jack lead, Partner will be forced to win with the Ace and the Dummy's King-Ten will be worth 2 sure tricks.|
