ht|g|at|So far we have discussed two basic positions (the "Fork" and the "Problem suit") in their elementary form: after executing the elimination process, we simply threw a defender in by playing two unproductive cards in the throw-in suit.

Next, I will show you additional ways to throw a defender in. 

They are less elementary but do occur frequently.


|fp|2|at|1. Exiting with a trump.|fp||at|

This possibility occurs when, in a potential elimination setting, declarer holds a trump combination that allows him to 
put a defender on lead with a trump.

For example: When you are missing three or four trumps to the King, it is usually right to finesse. 

An exception may occur when you hold an elimination setting.

In such cases it may be a better idea to lay down the Ace. 

If the trumps break 2-1 but the King does not fall, you will then have the option of endplaying the defender who is left with the King.|

ht|f|at|Here are some possible trump combinations where this sort of play might be preferable:
^c@2
1. AKxxx-xxxx(x)  against Qxx-x(x).

2. Axxxx-Jxxxx  against Kx-Q or Qx-K.

3. Axxx-Kxxx  against any 3-2 split.

4. AQxxx -10xxx  against Kx in situations where a losing finesse may cost.

^bHolding the following hand, you arrived at the contract of 4@h and got the lead of the @d10.|

are divided.|

ht|f|fp|2|at|2. Loser-on-loser elimination-throw-in.|fp||at|

This is one of the most common ways to throw a particular defender in, forcing him to make a lead to our advantage.

The loser-on-loser concept is basically a form of the general elimination-throw-in tactic that aims to save a trick we would otherwise lose.  
Look at this layout:|

ht|w|at|Playing a 6@s contract, You can ruff the opening lead in hand and draw the adverse trumps in one or two rounds.
Sooner or later you will have to deal with your two potential diamond losers. A successful finesse in the suit will bring 
your slam home. Alas, if the finesse fails you will lose two diamond tricks and your slam. What can you do about that? 

Move ahead and see!|
