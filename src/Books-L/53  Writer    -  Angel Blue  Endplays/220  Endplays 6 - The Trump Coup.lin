ht|f|n^|9|at|"Trump coup" is a trump-endplay method based on drawing a defender's finesseable trumps whenever an ordinary finesse is impossible.

Trump Coups have a wide variety of types and subtypes as well as a number of difficulty levels and complications, but to be devoted to my declaration to make it a simple guide, I will do my best to deal only with its simplest forms.

|n^|5|at|The trump coup is a technique based on the trump reducing tactic and can be used by declarer when the adverse trumps are divided unevenly but he cannot finesse the suit as he doesn't have a trump available for this mission.

|n^|5|at|The trump coup allows declarer to make the finesse without the lead of trump itself.
|lg|c|at|
|n^|5|at|Here are the conditions required for a trump coup:
^c@21.  The defender's trumps are on the right side of declarer's fork position.
2.  Declarer is able to cash the winners needed for his contract without suffering a ruff.
3.  Declarer is in a position to lead a card through the threatening defender towards his own trump holding. 
4.  There are entries to both declarer and dummy's hand.

^bDeclarer should execute his coup as follows:
1.  Reduce his trump holding to match the number held by the defender.|n^|4|cp|red|at|@.|cp||n#|4|at|
2.  Cash his winners until only trumps left in his hand.|n^|4|cp|red|at|@.|cp||n#|4|at|
3.  Finish in the hand opposite his trumps (usually dummy).  
4.  Lead from this hand, forcing the defender to ruff. 
5.  Overruff whichever trump played by the defender.
6.  Cash his remaining trump winners.
|n#|3|n^|2|cp|red|at|^b  @.|cp||n#|2|at|  Steps 1 and 2 can be reversed or combined.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|

ht|f|at|Here is a basic example of a position where the trump coup can be accomplished:|

ht|h|at|^e@s 107|
ht|i|at|^e@h -|

ht|j|at|^c@s 54| 
ht|k|at|^c@h -| 

ht|j|at|^g@s -|
ht|k|at|^g@h K7|

ht|l|at|^e@s -|
ht|m|at|^e@h AQ|

ht|n|n#|2|at|With South declaring a heart contract, he can win two trump tricks if North has the lead. Declarer leads a spade from dummy, forcing East to ruff. Declarer overruffs and cashes his remaining trump. The play of the spade from dummy allows declarer  a trump finesse without leading a trump from the opposite hand.

|n^|5|at|But suppose the end position was:|

ht|r|at|^i@s 1072|
ht|s|at|^i@h -|

ht|t|at|^g@s 543| 
ht|u|at|^g@h -| 

ht|t|at|^k@s 9|
ht|u|at|^k@h K7|

ht|v|at|^i@s -|
ht|w|at|^i@h AQ5|

ht|x|n#|5|at|Again, a spade is led from dummy, but this time declarer has to ruff and must give up a trump trick to East. In order to avoid being locked in the lead from hand prematurely, declarer has to set up the coup through a trump reduction first. The timing of the coup must therefore be perfect. |
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|

ht|f|at|I hope the following partial deal will clarify the necessity of this perfection:|
ht|h|at|^e@s Q109|
ht|i|at|^e@h -|
ht|j|at|^e@d AQ|

ht|k|at|^c@s 876| 
ht|l|at|^c@h -| 
ht|m|at|^c@d K7|

ht|k|at|^g@s 4|
ht|l|at|^g@h K7|
ht|m|at|^g@d 83|

ht|n|at|^e@s -|
ht|o|at|^e@h AQ5|
ht|p|at|^e@d 42|

ht|r|at|Declarer, requiring all five tricks in a heart game, finesses the @dQ successfully. If declarer now cashes the @dA, the results will not be satisfactory.

To avoid this, declarer should instead ruff one of his spade winners.

Then he should play a diamond to the Ace, completing the correctly timed preparation for the endplay.

Finally, he will play one of his remaining spade winners to trap East's trumps.

Let's see these two variations in a movie format.|

ht|g|at|Let's summarize what we know so far about the trump coup tactic:

A trump coup is a method of beating defender's finessable trumps without the lead of a trump through defender's hand.

It achieves the same effect as a regular finesse in the trump suit but without requiring a trump lead from the opposite hand.

To achieve this, the play should be arranged in a way that the defender will be forced to ruff into the fork behind him.

In preparing the coup, declarer should play the required number of winning tricks in the side suits and reduce his trumps to match the threatening opponent's holding. 

The final step of a trump coup is the lead of a card through the defender with only trumps left. Declarer can now score his remaining trumps by an overruff. 

If declarer, instead, discards losers in a side suit before reducing his trumps and the threatening defender refuses to ruff, he would endplay himself, having to lead a trump from his holding.

Entries are critical in planning this play.

The following deals will illustrate the whole process.|

at|As you have no way to pick up East's @cJ9 with a straightforward finesse, you should try to perform a trump coup.
^^|n^|5|at|To achieve the coup position you must ruff two of dummy's red cards in your hand.  That will leave you with the @cK10 over East's @cJ9.
^^But you must arrange your play in a way that allows you to put dummy on lead at trick 11.  Are there any problems ?|
