^*bMM:^*n  Formatting changes for ^*b aaBridge ^*n by   RogerPfi   and   GG_Bridge   (August 2018).
|n#|5|at|^c  @2With thanks to Arik for his permission to include this work in aaBridge.  In adapting this approximately 10 year old work I have shortened Arik's marvelous title (preserved above), which was used through the original lin file, to the single word  - ^*bEndplays^*n.  
|n#|5|at|His indexing system has also been changed in keeping with the need to split the original single file into the 15 sections that you can see in the left hand column of the index.
|n#|5|at|The content remains 100% Arik.|

ht|e|at|
^*baaBridge^*n  has a lot more features than the older lin file players.  In particular aaBridge can play the Opps cards.  In the older players you could only 'play' hands double dummy and then only by playing all the cards yourself.

So it now makes sense to use this work in a different way to that which Arik had in mind when he wrote it.

This is my suggestion: 

Whenever Arik first shows you a Deal,  click the  { ^*b 1st ^*n }  button and try to    |fp|2|at|Play it Yourself|fp||at|.

If you finish or if it is too complicated - no problem - just click the   { ^*b Back to Movie ^*n }  and continue reading the text.


Whenever a deal comes to an end (there will sometimes be a few tricks left to play),  if you want to check that it will play to the end as the text says it will,  click the   { ^*b Cont ^*n }  button and ^*b continue ^*n to play out the rest of the tricks.


|lg|m|at|The  { ^*b Enter the Deal ^*n }  button allows you to ^*b Review ^*n the play of the deal and later to click the { ^*b Play ^*n }  button that will then be on the left hand side, so letting you -  |fp|2|at|play out the hand  FROM THAT POINT|fp||at|. 
|n#|3|at|This can be important, because - at times - changing the first few plays may cause the problem to not 'work' as Arik intended.|

ht|z|n#|0|at|^b^*bMM:^*n  Remember you can |cp|red|at| ^*b PLAY ^*n|cp||at| ^*b ANY HAND ^*n  at  ^*b ANY TIME ^*n  by clicking the  { ^*b 1st ^*n }  button.|

ht|f|at|Many playing techniques such as "Endplay" are often regarded by the non-expert players as "only for experts" strategies.

In fact, the term "Endplays" covers several playing techniques like the Eliminating-throw-in plays, coups and squeezes. 

The term "Endplay" basically refers to all situations where an opponent is forced to lead, discard or sacrifice one or more tricks. Each individual endplay hand has its own critical point in which the endplay occurs.

In this article I will restrict myself to deal only with three categories:

|lg|d|at|
^*bEndplays  1 - 4^*n   ^fcover the    |fp|2|at|Elimination-Throw-in|fp||at|
^f   @2An Endplay technique that is primarily based upon three possible positions viz:
|n#|3|at|^gthe  |fp|2|at|Fork|at|,   the  |fp|2|at|Problem-suit|at|,  and  the  |fp|2|at|Entry|fp||at|  positions.


^b^*bEndplays  5^*n    ^fcovers the   |fp|2|at|Trump Ending|fp||at|
^f   An Endplay technique that enables declarer to cope with a hostile trump distribution.


^b^*bEndplays  6 - 7^*n  ^fcovers the   |fp|2|at|Trump Coup|at|  and  |fp|2|at|Coup en Passant|fp||at| 
^f   Two more methods of coping with a bad trump distribution. |
