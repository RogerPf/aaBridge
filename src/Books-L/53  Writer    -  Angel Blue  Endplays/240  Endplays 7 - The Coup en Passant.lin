ht|f|n^|7|at|Coup en Passant is a trump coup combined with a loser on loser play. 
|lg|b|at|
|n^|7|at|The term "Coup en Passant" was taken from the chess game where a pawn is captured after passing over a square 
guarded by the opposing pawn. 

|n^|7|at|The main goal of this tactic is to combine two losers into one.
^c@2
|n^|7|at|^bIt is very similar in nature to the trump coup:
1.  Both occur when a defender has a natural trump trick but there is no way to finesse in trumps. 
2.  In both the trump reducing process is the key play.
3.  In both declarer needs a sufficient number of entries to the opposite hand.

^bBut there are two significant differences between these two techniques:
1.  The Coup en Passant occurs when declarer has a certain trump loser and an apparent certain loser in a 
^x side suit.
2.  Declarer doesn't have a fork over the defender's trump holding.

|n^|7|at|^bDeclarer should execute the Coup en Passant as follows:
1.  Reduce his trump holding to the same length (or fewer) of the defender. 
2.  Cash winners (hoping to not being ruffed or overruffed prematurely), until only trump(s) and loser(s) 
     are left in the hand over the threatening defender. 
3.  Finish in the hand on the right side of this defender.
4.  Lead a card through the defender from a suit in which the opposite hand is void. 

|n^|7|at|^bThen:
a. If the defender ruffs with his natural trump trick, declarer discards a loser. 
b. If the defender discards, declarer ruffs.|

ht|f|at|Here is a comparison between the end positions of the Trump coup and the Coup en Passant, in both South plays a spade 
contract and needs to establish an extra trick.|

ht|n|at|^u@s 10|
ht|o|at|^u@h 3|

ht|q|at|^s@s 6|
ht|r|at|^s@h 9|

ht|t|at|In the trump coup position, declarer wins two trump tricks by leading a heart from dummy through East's @sK7.

In the Coup en Passant position, declarer leads a club from dummy, and now:
1.  If East ruffs, declarer discards the @h9 (loser on loser play).
2.  If East discards the @h3, declarer ruffs with the @s6. 
Either way, declarer converts two losers into one winner. 

Notice that the trump suit in the Coup en Passant position does not include a fork.|

ht|f|at|Let's see two more positions where declarer can perform the Coup en Passant.|

ht|h|at|^ea.|
ht|h|at|^pb.|
ht|h|at|^s@s 6|
ht|i|at|^s@h 7|

ht|j|at|^q@s 10|

ht|k|at|^u@h 10|
ht|l|at|^u@c 7|

ht|m|at|^s@s -|
ht|n|at|^s@h 3|
ht|o|at|^s@c 6| 


ht|h|at|^h@s -|
ht|i|at|^h@h 72|

ht|k|at|^j@s QJ|
ht|l|at|^j@h 10|

ht|n|at|^h@s K6|
ht|o|at|^h@h Q|

ht|q|at|In both of the above positions, South plays a spade contract and needs to establish an extra trick.

In a, declarer leads a club from dummy, and now:
1.  If East ruffs, declarer discards the @hQ (loser on loser play).
2.  If East discards the @h10, declarer ruffs with the @s6. 
This way or the other, declarer scores an extra trick. 

In b, the threatening defender is West. Declarer leads a club from his hand, and now:
1.  If West ruffs, declarer discards the @h7 from dummy.
2.  If West discards the @h5, declarer ruffs.
This way or the other, declarer scores an extra trick.

Let's now move ahead to see the example hands.|
