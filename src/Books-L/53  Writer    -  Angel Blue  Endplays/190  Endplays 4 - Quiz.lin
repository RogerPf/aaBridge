ht|f|at|The four quizzes were designed in three steps.

First, you will get a chance to plan your play with only your and dummy's hands visible.

Take your time, don't rush. Remember: ^*BThe harder the training the easier the battle^*N.| 

ht|k|at|Next, you will have the hand with the solution. Use the right arrow below the deal to move through the 
playing process. 

Finally, you will have all the quizzes in a playable mode, where you can replay them as often as you want, 
by clicking on the cards.

To get the most out of these quizzes, I recommend to move back and forth through all the available variations, 
including the erroneous plays.

This way you will learn to avoid errors when, in the future, you will have to cope with similar situations.|
