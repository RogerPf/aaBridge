ht|f|at|It sometimes happens that a defender has a long and strong trump over or behind your trump holding and you need an  extra trump trick to make your contract or worse, you cannot lose even one trick to the outstanding trumps. 

You may learn about such hostile holdings from the bidding  -  for example, you were doubled @- or you discover  that in the early play. 

Every so often you may discover that a defender has finesseable trumps but you cannot finesse, because:
^c@2
1.  Dummy's trumps are gone because you drew them.
2.  You don't have a sufficient number of entries to dummy for the required number of finesses.
3.  You used, or need to use, dummy's trumps for other important purposes.
^b@2
If you are aware of the situation in time, you can often rescue yourself if you stop leading trumps and go after ruffs, trying  to perform a trump endplay.
|lg|8|at|
For a trump endplay to work, you should apply the "Trump reducing" technique. 

You do that by ruffing yourself down until you have equal or fewer trumps than those held by the opponent.

Meanwhile, you cash winners in side suits.

Finally you throw in the proper defender so he must concede the required trump trick.

Look at the following deal:|

qx|TE-u,wide|
ht|a|n#|5|fp|2|at|^*b^a TE-u ^c|fp||at|^*gIndx:Index,Click for Index^*n|

ht|g|at|This is the unusual play of a smaller trump under the opponent's ruffing trump. The situation  occurs when there are no cards in both your hand and the right side defender other than trumps. The goal is to  leave this defender on lead, endplayed. This may not happen very frequently though worth being familiar with. 

Here are two example layouts where the underruff would be required:|
ht|l|at|^ba.|
ht|l|at|^d@d76|
ht|m|at|^d@hA               -|
ht|n|at|^f@sQJ8|
ht|o |at|^d    -|
ht|p|at|^d@sA96|

ht|r|at|In a: At the end of a spade contract, you play the @hA from dummy. If East ruffs with the 8, you can overruff with the 9 for  two trump tricks. So East, having the exact layout of the trumps in mind, would instead ruff with the Jack. If you overruff now with the Ace, you will be endplayed and have to give East two trump tricks.  To assure yourself two trump tricks, you should play the 6 under the Jack, endplaying East.|
ht|l|at|^jb.|
ht|l|at|^l@hJ8|
ht|m|at|^l@c7              -|
ht|n|at|^n@hQ109|
ht|o |at|^l    -|
ht|p |at|^l@hK76|

ht|v|at|In b: Playing a heart contract, you lead the @c7 from dummy, East ruffs with the 9. If you overruff with the King, you will be endplayed and must lose two trump tricks to East. On the other hand, if you play the 6 instead, East will be endplayed and  you will gain two trump tricks.

Needless to say that to achieve the actual layouts, you have to start by reducing your trump holding. 

Let's see two examples of this technique.|
