cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT|: I always wished to go on assignment with unlimited expense account like those we read about it in the papers. Finally, my dream came through. Maureen our BIL manager and Howard our great teacher had a pilot study to present bridge topics of interest to bridge students much enjoyable to study than reading endless lines of text. So, I jumped at the occasion. With an eye for a free travel I suggested a fireside chat format. Thus, I received an assignment to interview Howard in Florida and report to the BIL members.|

Everything went smooth afterward. Soon I received a first class airline ticket to Florida for March 10, 2009 to meet Howard before his mentoring session that day. The topic was DONT. The note with the ticket said that all the expenses are fully paid by BIL. I was delighted and bragged about my new assignment in our local club. My dream finally came through.|

The flight was fun except for a stop and plane change in Dallas-Fort worth, Texas. In Florida I was limousined to Howard's adobe which is located on a beautiful Imperial palm lined street with manicured lawns. The house is gorgeous with warm exterior colors and dark red shutters on the windows. It exudes class. Taffy was the first to greet me. Then I met Ava and finally Howard. I was a bit nervous to meet my hero and my Rock Star. But, his usual gentle and mild manner erased all my jitters.|

And finally, back in my five stars hotel while writing my report based on our chat I received a call from front desk saying, "|FP|2|cp|8|at|This morning the bank which had the funds for my travel expenses filed for Chapter 11 and I would be responsible for all the expenses.|FP||cp||at|"  Oh well, I sure have too many dreams in my old age.

cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT| - I understand DONT stands for (D)isturb (O)pponents (N)o (T)rump and Marty Bergen is the author. Please explain it and tell us when is it used?|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

Howard: ^*N|cp||at|DONT should be used when you have a hand suitable for competing over a 1N opener. I will discuss the exact requirements later. But, in general, if your hand is either somewhat distributional or has some strength, you should compete by making a DONT bid.
|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT| - Is it correct that DONT is really to disturb and get a part score rather than trying for a game or higher auctions?|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

Howard: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, the purpose of DONT is to arrive at the best part score. In general, once an opponent opens a strong NT, it is unlikely your side has game. So, DONT is designed to get you to a good part score. You may occasionally miss a game, but this is more than made up by the many successful part scores you will find if you play DONT.
|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT| - There are other conventions to disturb a 1NT opener beside DONT such as Astro, Pinpoint, Brozel, Modified Brozel, Hamilton, Cappiletti and Modified Cappiletti. You do prefer DONT. What is your reasoning? |
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

Howard: ^*N|cp||at|I prefer DONT because it allows you to compete on more hand types and find a good part score at the 2 level. Most of these other conventions often require stronger hands to compete because you may often end up at the 3 level, so you will have to pass with many hands that, were you playing DONT, you would be able to compete with.

cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT| - Another good teacher opines that the auction of 1NT-P-P-P is difficult to successfully defend and the intention for opponent should be to push them out of 1NT auction. What are your thoughts on the issue please?|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
Howard: ^*N|cp||at|I agree with the other teacher that more often than not, you will not get a good score if the auction goes 1N-P-P-P. At best, you are unlikely to beat 1N more than a trick or two, and if you can beat it, you probably can make a part score of your own. And, they will often make 1N, and you will still have a part score contract that you could have made instead.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT| - Is it true that DONT is really more so based on shape rather the points of the hand? I will ask specifics later.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
Howard: ^*N|cp||at|The more distribution you have, the fewer points you need to bid DONT. And, because the NT opener has a good hand, on average you will hold fewer points. So, because of that, you will tend to compete more often with DONT based on distribution than high cards.
|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT| - Now then, my RHO opens 1NT. What should I look for in my hand to correctly bid a DONT. Now, you can be specific with shape and point range please.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
Howard: ^*N|cp||at|Let us look at single suited hands first. You should bid DONT if you have the same sort of hand that you would be willing to overcall with a suit at the 2 level had the opponent opened a suit at the one level. So, you need either a six card suit, or a good five card suit, and typically at least ten or so points (using Bergen hand evaluation methods).|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


AT|

With a 2 suited hand, it is a bit more complicated. With 5/5, you can compete with as few as 7 or 8 HCP, particularly if your values are concentrated in your suits. With 5/4, you probably should have at least 10 or 11 HCP. Lately, I almost never bid DONT in direct seat with only 4-4 and will only bid DONT in balancing seat with 4-4 if I have close to an opener and my 2 suits are very good (each have at least 2 honors).|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


AT|

Also, you should be a bit more cautious when you are vulnerable, and can be a bit more aggressive when non-vulnerable.

cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT| - Now, I like to concentrate on each part of DONT one at a time. From your explanation I understand that I should show all single suited hands with the DONT double except when the holding is a weak spade. Before I ask you what a single suit is what if beside having a single suit the hand contains 4+card side suit?|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
Howard: ^*N|cp||at|In general, if you have a six card suit, you are normally better playing in that suit. So, if you have a hand with both six card and 4 card suits, I would tend to treat that as a single suited hand. rather than a 2 suited hand.
|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT| - Thank you. Back to the single suit issue. I understand that the longer the single suit is the less points is needed to bid a DONT double, Therefore, I have the following hypothetical single suits which I need help on point requirement. What would it take for each of the following to bid a DONT double.
- A. a five + cards with no  4+ card side suit.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
Howard: ^*N|cp||at|As I mentioned previously, you should bid a DONT double (single suit) if you have the same sort of hand that you would be willing to overcall with a suit at the 2 level had the opponent opened a suit at the one level. So, you need either a six card suit, or a good five card suit, and typically at least ten or so points (using Bergen hand evaluation methods).|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT| and - B. A six or seven card suit. I am sure an eight or nine is possible but for now just the six and seven would do.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
Howard: ^*N|cp||at|With a six card suit, you should be willing to compete with as little as 7 or 8 points. With a seven card suit, even 5 or 6 points can be enough. However, if you have fewer points, your high cards should be concentrated in your long suit.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT| - Now to the two suited hands. Again, I understand that the point requirement for a 6-6 is less that 4-5. First, please give a few examples of two suited hands and define your point range.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
Howard: ^*N|cp||at|With a 2 suited hand, it is a bit more complicated. With 5/5, you can compete with as few as 7 or 8 HCP, particularly if your values are concentrated in your suits. With 5/4, you probably should have at least 10 or 11 HCP. And with 4/4, you need at least an opening hand.|

cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT| - Thank you. I am sure if any of your students has a question on a 7-4 and a 4-7 holdings they can ask you via email, unless you wish to answer it now.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
Howard: ^*N|cp||at|You are right. You have my email address here.|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT| - Let me clear one important point before we go to other parts. From your instructions, I understand that we always bid the lower ranking of the two suits regardless of the the shape or the strength of each two suits. For example with 2-2-5-4 or a 2-5-2-4 or a 5-2-2-4 the  bid always is 2@C. Is that correct?|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
Howard: ^*N|cp||at|As I mentioned, you should usually treat a hand with one four card suit and one 6+ card suit as a single suited hand. On any hand that you choose to treat as 2 suited, DONT requires that you bid your lower ranking suit, even if your higher ranking suit is stronger. |
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT| - Let us shift to partner's response after a DONT bid assuming the next opponent simply passes. Please, tell us what would be partner's response if the auction goes 1NT-D-P ?|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
Howard: ^*N|cp||at|Over a DONT double (showing a single suited hand), the doubler's partner must bid 2@C. This allows the doubler to bid their suit at the 2 level (or pass if their suit is clubs).|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT| - Thank you. Now if the auction is 1NT-2@C-P ?|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
Howard: ^*N|cp||at|When the DONT bidder bids a suit, showing a 2 suited hand, partner should pass with 3+ card support. Otherwise, partner should bid the next higher suit, to allow the DONT bidder to pass if that is their 2nd suit or to bid their other suit at the 2 level. In the example auction you gave, partner should pass with 3+ clubs, otherwise bid 2@D.
|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT| - And if the auction was 1NT-2@H-P|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
Howard: ^*N|cp||at|On this auction, the DONT bidder's 2 suits are known (hearts and spades). Therefore, partner should pass with better hearts or bid 2@S with better spades. |

^-|FP||CS||cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT| -- So far very good. But while back I had a 2-7-1-2 hand and the auction was 1NT-X-P to me and I bid 2@H and was royally roasted. Please comment what would be the correct response when responder to a DONT double has a 7+ card in diamond or heart? Should the response still be 2@C?|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

Howard: ^*N|cp||at|Theoretically, you are supposed to bid 2@C over the double. However, with a 7+ card suit of your own, it is permissible to bid your suit. It is more likely that you will be better off in your suit than partner's suit. So, partner should not have complained on that particular hand.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

Howard: ^*N|cp||at|In response to DONT Double partner should have great suit of his own (at least 6 cards with working values or a 5-card choke full of honors) to bid that suit instead of the usual 2@C bid.bids his own independent suit instead of 2@C. It is rare, however, that partner can bypass the 2@C relay bid.|

PG| ***** 50 ***** |


HT|t|cp|8|AT|^c@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|First of all, you can have as little as 4/4 and show 2 suits if you have an opening hand or better. Second of all, in general, you should bid 2@S rather than doubling and bidding 2@S. As originally defined, Bergen said 2@S directly was weaker than doubling and bidding 2@S, but I feel the preemptive value of bidding 2@S right away is such that you should always bid 2S when you have spades.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


AT|

In fact, I play a revised version of DONT. I play 2@H shows a single suited heart hand, rather than hearts and spades. That is because I feel that are more hands where you have a single suited heart hand than a 2 suited heart/spade hand. And 2@H has good preemptive value. Playing this revised version of DONT, to show hearts and spades, you double and correct 2@C to 2@H.|

^B@2South overcalls 2@C to show a 2-suited hand.  North does not have 3+ card support in clubs, so must bid the next higher suit (2@D in this case) to allow South to show the second suit.

^B@2Since double would show a single-suited hand, North can't show the strong balanced hand.  He just has to pass.  However, that's not usually a disaster.  When someone opens a strong No-Trump, it's very rare to have a strong hand, and even if you do have, passing usually works out OK.

^*bPlaying DONT, you give up the penalty double.^*n|

nt|^B@2^Y@32@S is a "spare" bid playing DONT.  So it's used to show a very weak hand with spades - just to get in the opponents' way.  East would double then bid 2@S with a better hand.
^*bPlaying DONT, a direct 2@S overcall is a very weak bid.^*n|

I do not agree with the original definition where you bid 2@S with a weak hand, and double and correct to 2S with a stronger hand. I think you should always just bid 2@S if you have spades.|

^B@2After a DONT bid, the partnership often has to "scramble" to find the best fit at the 2-level.  Here, responder could bid 2D (pass/correct).  That would work out well if South had the minors.  But South will bid 2S - disaster!  It pays to be ^*ipessimistic^*n and assume partner has the suits you are short in.  Best is for North to bid 2H, natural and not forcing.

^*bAfter a DONT bid, a new suit (not the next step) is natural and non-forcing.^*n|

^B@2Unless North had 6+ good hearts, he should bid the conventional 2D (or pass)  and hope for the best. This hand happened to work out, but it usually will not. |

nt|When the auction starts 1NT - Pass - Pass, it pays to bid as often as you can if you're unbalanced.  Playing DONT, that's even more true.  Firstly, partner will probably be balanced (he didn't overcall himself!) so he should have a fit for you somewhere.  Secondly, he will often be quite strong (he couldn't double for penalties, remember).  So even if you are weak, don't be scared - bid!

^*bAfter 1NT - Pass - Pass, try to bid with almost any unbalanced hand.^*n|

^B@2Here responder has a strong hand and wants to look for game. 2NT is forcing, asking for partner's second suit.

^*bAfter a DONT overcall, 2NT is forcing - but you need a very good hand!^*n|

Kia: Howard, please tell us how do you feel about the 2NT|
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


NT|
^B@2Do not agree that West should bid 2N with a strong hand. Sure, on this hand it works out well, but more often partner will have a weaker hand, and you will get too high. Remember, DONT is designed to find a good 2 level part score; it is very rare in real life that you will miss a game, and your plusses for the part scores will more than make up for that small disadvantage.|

^B@2An immediate 3@H overcall is weak with a long suit.  So by doubling THEN going to the 3-level, West shows a strong hand.  East should raise.

^*bPlaying DONT, it's possible to show a "strong jump overcall".^*n|

4@H is better than 3@H. You have a solid 8-card suit, and will take heart tricks even if partner has 0 HCP and a void in hearts (and that is extremely unlikely).|

cp|8|fp||at|^c@2^Y@3Kia|CP||AT|: Here, I recognize a need for a second opinion. But, first a disclosure. The boards starting with x1 through x26 are the work of a bridge dilettante before he became a devotee to Howard's style. He learned that you do not DONT with a strong hand. However, Howard sternly reminded the dilettante, "As you know, I rarely pass 1N even with a good hand." So, next is what he approves. So, even the dilettante is not immune to a second opinion.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|c|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.
