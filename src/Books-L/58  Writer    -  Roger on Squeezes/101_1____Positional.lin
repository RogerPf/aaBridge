at|A simple squeeze is one that squeezes a single opponent in only two suits.  The simplest of the 'simple' squeezes are the 'Positional' squeezes.  The 'Positional' squeezes are so called because they only work against an opponent sitting in a particular position.   In the early examples this will mainly be West.

The secret of squeezes is to  ^*bLearn the Patterns^*n.

With the  'patterns'  in your mind you can try to find them in the examples.  With practice, just repeatedly going through examples is enough, you will start to  'see'  squeezes.|

ht|q|lg|b|at|
There are lots of books on Squeeze play.   I like the (1985) series by ^*b Hugh Kelsey ^*n.  You only need the first book ^*b Simple Squeezes^*n.  I suggest you try sites like ^*h abebooks.com ^*n for a second hand copy.

This work takes the same presentation order as Kelsey follows in ^*b Simple Squeezes ^*n but uses none of his examples, so making this work an excellent accompaniment to his book.|

To  ^*bPlay^*n  the Practice hands    -   Click either the  {^*b Cont ^*n}  or the  {^*b Enter the Deal ^*n}  button.  

When available, the two buttons will appear in the green area at the bottom right of this window.

Clicking either takes you  'into the deal'.   You return back to this tutorial by clicking the  {^*b Back to Movie ^*n}  button.

This ^*h http://musingsonbridge.rogerpf.com/2016/04/down-rabbit-hole.html ^*n blog-post ^*x contains a diagram that will help to explain this.

After clicking  { ^*b Cont ^*n }  you continue the play by clicking on a ^*b CARD ^*n or on the  { ^*b Undo ^*n }  button.

While playing you can  use the  {^*b Show ^*n}  /  {^*b Hide ^*n}  button to  show / hide  the opponents cards.


The  {^*b Enter the Deal ^*n}  button is like a 'grown-up' version of the continue button.
|n^|a|at|
 ^g after clicking it you get to choose (by use of a button) which of three things you want to do. 

|n^|5|at|
{^*b Edit ^*n}  let's you explore the deal  'double dummy'.   Click a ^*bCARD^*n to play it.    Use  {^*b Undo ^*n}  to unplay cards.

{^*b Play ^*n}  let's you play the remaining cards (against the computer).    As with  ^*bEdit^*n  any un-reviewed play is discarded.

{^*b Review ^*n}  (the default)  let's you run back and forth in the existing play.     Use  ^*bFlow^*n,    "^*b>^*n"   and the  ^*bNavbar^*n.
^s(^*bMouse wheel^*n  is best)

^c@2Win the lead of the @sQ with the dummy's Ace.
Play the top two @d's ending in hand.
Cash the @hAK
Run the @c's, at first discarding two low hearts (keeping only the Jack)   
^d then discarding low @s's,  so ending with   @sK9  @hJ   in dummy.
With the play of the last club (the squeeze card @c9), ^*b East ^*n will be squeezed.

I am playing for East to have started with   @SQJ10  @HQxx.     On the play of the squeeze card (@c9), East will  EITHER -
	^d ... discard his @hQ.  In which case, I will discard the @s9 and lead to the @sK and cash the @hJ.
^c OR  |fp|s|at|(more likely)|fp||at|
	^d ... discard his @s guard (keeping the @hQ).  In which case I will discard the @HJ and lead to the  @sK  
	       ^p expecting the @sJ to fall so promoting my @s9.

^b I know this is a lot to expect but it will come with repetition of the hands, again and again.
