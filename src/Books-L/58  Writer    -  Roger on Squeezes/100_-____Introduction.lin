n#|1|at| 
There are two types of chapters in this 'book'.  The first type, which are numbered and have gray banners (like the one you can see above) are ^*b Squeeze ^*n chapters.
|n^|9|at| 
The second type, which have letter designations and have slightly pink banners are ^*b Technique ^*n chapters.

|fp|t-title|at|Books|fp||

In later chapters I often refer to Hugh Kelsey's, Simple Squeezes (1985).  Also Google Books has a preview of the David Birds (2002) book  ^*h https://books.google.com/books?id=4TlSChG-PuAC, Bridge Squeezes for Everyone  -  Yes, Even You!^*n   Once the link opens click the picture of the cover to see the contents.

|fp|t-title|at|Squeeze  Patterns|fp||
n#|2|at| 
The book has as its key concept the idea that  -  finding a squeeze is all about looking for the pattern of that squeeze.  Compare this with trying to recognise a fingerprint given a collection of prints for reference.

This Introductory Chapter covers:|lg|e|at|
^d^*g   Lern, How to  - Learn -  the patterns of each Squeeze ^*n
^d^*g   Genr, How to  use  aaBridge to generate 'Interesting' Hands (which may include Squeezes) ^*n|

at|On the right is an example squeeze pattern.  It is the Positional Simple Squeeze, which is described fully in the next chapter.

To learn a squeeze's pattern you need to:

^c@.   Read and re-read its chapter.

^c@.   Play out all the supplied endings  -  and become very familiar with them.
@1^z@3
^c@.   Write out - |cp|red|at|^*b on paper ^*n|cp||at| -  the pattern you are studying.  DO IT 3 TIMES  for each pattern.

^c@.   Do NOT neglect the ^*b Inverted ^*n version of the pattern - write it out as well.|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


at|^^^^
You need to do the above |cp|red|at|every day|cp||at| or so for a week or more until you can write it out 
^q from memory without hesitation.
|lg|c|at|
The ideal is to get to the point where you can close your eyes and (perhaps in bed) bring the pattern to mind and play though the final few tricks - all from memory.  

Once you can do this it will be seeping deep into your unconscious, and will become part of your unconscious competence.  

You will then start to find that the exercises become easier.   Over time the ^*b conscious ^*n effort you put in to looking for squeezes at the table, will be rewarded by your ^*b  unconscious ^*n lending a hand.|

ht|d|n#|5|at|    @.  You can have two copies of  ^*baaBridge^*n  open at once  -  one reading this, the other following along.
|n^|9|at|	
On the aaBridge  ^*bWelcome^*n  page is a button marked  { ^*bPlay Bridge^*n }  click that.
In the right hand column the  ^*bNew Deals^*n  tab will now be showing.  
Click on a radio button   eg:   ^i ^*b31+  slam 4-4, 4-3^*n
                      ^gOR      ^i ^*b32+  6NT^*n
|n^|9|at|
Click the 5th  |cp|red|at| ^*b'Interesting'  Deal Selector^*n |cp||at|  button   (hard)
Next click the   { ^*bNew Board^*n }   button  center left.
|n^|9|at|
Once the new board appears (after a few moments) you can use the ^*b Hide / Show ^*n  button to quickly examine the deal and see if the target, here 12 tricks, will be easy to make,  allow yourself to take any finesses that will make and to drop singleton Kings and take easy ruffs.
|n^|9|at|
If you decide it will be too easy to play click   { ^*bNew Board^*n }   and examine the next deal.
|n^|9|at|
When you think you have found a deal that is not so simple, for safety, click ^*b Save ^*n (top right).  Now click ^*b Hide ^*n (was labelled as ^*b Show ^*n) and play it out against the computer.  With luck you may have hit an interesting endplay or even a squeeze.
|n^|9|at|
If you see the aaBridge bots choose a particularly poor defense, please follow the hint that will be displayed and start the bots off on a better line.  (It is very hard to write bots that can, pick the line of play, that ^*b human beings ^*n will find most difficult).
|ht|x|n^|5|at|
|fp|t-title|at|A word of Caution|fp||at|
|n#|2|at|Do not expect to find squeezes until you have ^*b learnt ^*n up to at least  ^*b Chapter 2  The Automatic Squeeze ^*n and even then they will not come easily.  However, many of the generated deals will be 'interesting' and worthy of your time.|
