at|You have a potential squeeze against an opponent but you can see that both opponents guard a key suit.  
^^^*bIsolating the Guard^*n  is the technique that solves this problem by reducing the opponents holdings so that only one of the them now guards the suit.  The older (sadly inaccurate) traditional term for this technique is 'Isolating the Menace'.              Best to learn it as  -  Isolating the GUARD.
^^|at|{  |n#|5|at|The common way of ^*b Isolating the Guard ^*n is to ruff the suit until only one defender has cards remaining.

fp|b-bigtitle|at|How to  ^*bPlay^*   the  Practice Hands|fp||at|^^|
n#|2|at|
To  ^*bPlay^*n  the Practice hands    -   Click either the  {^*b Cont ^*n}  or the  {^*b Enter the Deal ^*n}  button.  

When available, the two buttons will appear in the green area at the bottom right of this window.

Clicking either takes you  'into the deal'.   You return back to this tutorial by clicking the  {^*b Back to Movie ^*n}  button.

The  ^*g:Doc Collection::Help,Doc Collection^*n  document  ^*b Down the Rabbit Hole ^*n  contains a diagram that will help to explain this.

After clicking  { ^*b 1st ^*n }  you continue the play by clicking on a ^*b CARD ^*n or on the  { ^*b Undo ^*n }  button.

While playing you can  use the  {^*b Show ^*n}  /  {^*b Hide ^*n}  button to  show / hide  the opponents cards.


The  {^*b Enter the Deal ^*n}  button is like a 'grown-up' version of the continue button.
|n^|a|at|
 ^g after clicking it you get to choose (by use of a button) which of three things you want to do. 

|n^|5|at|
{^*b Edit ^*n}  let's you explore the deal  'double dummy'.   Click a ^*bCARD^*n to play it.    Use  {^*b Undo ^*n}  to unplay cards.

{^*b Play ^*n}  let's you play the remaining cards (against the computer).    As with  ^*bEdit^*n  any un-reviewed play is discarded.

{^*b Review ^*n}  (the default)  let's you run back and forth in the existing play.     Use  ^*bFlow^*n,    "^*b>^*n"   and the  ^*bNavbar^*n.
^s(^*bMouse wheel^*n  is best)

|n#|5|at|Come back another time and play them through again.       Repetition will,  ^*b really will^*n,   get it all to sink in.|

fp|b-bigtitle|at|What is an Answer ?|fp||at|^^|
n#|2|at|
I know that the first (and even the second time) you go through the practice hands you will be just about starting to understand what is going on.   BUT after that ...

Successfully playing the hand against the bots is |cp|red|at|^*b NOT ^*n |cp||at|an answer, I repeat |cp|red|at|^*b NOT ^*n|cp||at| an answer, to the question.

The type of answer you NEED to give (assuming that you want to benefit from your work here) is - 
|n#|a|at|^c@2
|fp|t|at|Part 1   -   The 'Trick 1' PLAN|fp||at|          (NOT in the supplied answers, but YOU should think it out)
|n^|7|at|
A detailed statement (to yourself) of the order of the play of the tricks, including which hand you will be in at each stage and stating any discards.  The plan ends with the words 
  -  "With the play of the squeeze card (named) ... East or West or Both ... will be squeezed".
|n#|a|at|
|fp|t|at|Part 2   -   The Key Cards of the Squeeze|fp||at| 
|n^|5|at|
A statement defining YOUR important cards and where they will be when the squeeze card is played.
|n#|a|at|
|fp|t|at|Part 3   -   Your Opps remaining (important) Cards|fp||at|         (NOT in the supplied answers)
|n^|5|at|
A statement about the important cards your Opps hold and about which hand you expect to find them in, such as -   "I am playing for LHO to have the @sK and the ..."    Part 3 is an extension of 'Part 1 - the Plan', as it also covers what comes after the squeeze card is played.

|fp|t|at|Part 1   -   The 'Trick 1' PLAN|fp||at|       
|n^|7|at|
^c@2Win the lead of the @sQ with the dummy's Ace.
Play the top two @d's ending in hand.
Cash the @hAK
Run the @c's, at first discarding two low hearts (keeping only the Jack)   
^d then discarding low @s's,  so ending with   @sK9  @hJ   in dummy.
With the play of the last club (the squeeze card @c9), ^*b East ^*n will be squeezed.

|fp|t|at|^bPart 3   -   Your Opps remaining (important) Cards|fp||at|
|n^|8|at|
I am playing for East to have started with   @SQJ10  @HQxx.     On the play of the squeeze card (@c9), East will  EITHER -
	^d ... discard his @hQ.  In which case, I will discard the @s9 and lead to the @sK and cash the @hJ.
^c OR  |fp|s|at|(more likely)|fp||at|
	^d ... discard his @s guard (keeping the @hQ).  In which case I will discard the @HJ and lead to the  @sK  
	       ^p expecting the @sJ to fall so promoting my @s9.
|n#|5|at|
^b I know this is a lot to expect but it will come with repetition of the hands, again and again.|
