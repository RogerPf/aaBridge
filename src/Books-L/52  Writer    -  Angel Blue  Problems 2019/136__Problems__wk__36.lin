|n#|3|at|^*bMM:^*n  Angel Blue and kindly supplied ^*b ALL ^*n the text for THIS set of  8  deals.
|n#|4|at|    ^e(Here he does assume that you will spot the need to ruff all 3 @cs. A 'dummy reversal' for 12 tricks.)
|n#|4|at|If the loss of either initial finesse would result in the defeat of your contract, you must decide which of the two finesses to risk.
You have a possible heart loser, a loser that can be avoided if RHO has the Queen.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


ht|d|at|@4^^|
ht|d|at|
On the other hand, if LHO has the Jack of spades, you can lead a spade to the 10.
If the 10 of spades holds, you can later discard two hearts from dummy on the King-Queen of spades.
In other words, you are looking at two finesses and if either works you can make your grand slam.
But if you take the wrong one… down you go.

If only you knew which one to take.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


ht|d|at|@4^^|
ht|d|at|
Occasionally the best line is to combine your chances partially by following the following strategy:
IF YOU CANNOT TRY BOTH FINESSES, FIRST CASH THE TOP CARDS IN THE SUIT IN WHICH THE OUTSTANDING HONOR IS MORE LIKELY TO DROP.
Here you have one suit missing a Queen (hearts) and the other missing a Jack (spades).|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


ht|d|at|@4^^|
ht|d|at|
To increase your chances, play the Ace and the King in the suit missing a Queen.
If the Queen appears, you have 12 tricks.
If the Queen does not appear, take the finesse in the suit missing a Jack.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ht|d|at|@4^^|
ht|d|at|
Since one finesse is as good as the other, you pick something like an extra 20% by cashing the Ace-King of hearts before taking the finesse in spades, as the Queen might fall under the Aca-King.
Testing the hearts without giving up the lead has kept you alive to take the spade finesse, not to mention those extra 20%.|

You are now wide open in spades and must avoid taking any losing finesse.
You have eight sure tricks and if clubs divide, you do not have to worry about either red suit finesse.
You test the clubs but LHO discards a heart on the second round.
If either finesse works you make your contract.|

In cases like this, the following rule comes in handy.
WHEN FACING A CHOICE OF FINESSES IN TWO SUITS MISSING THE QUEEN AND EITHER OF THESE FINESSES WILL GIVE YOU THE CONTRACT, PLAY THE ACE AND THE KING OF THE LONGEST SUIT AND IF THE QUEEN DOES NOT DROP, TAKE THE FINESSE IN THE OTHER SUIT.|

Here, the best play is the diamonds Ace and King, followed by the King of hearts and heart to the Jack.|

|n#|3|at|You have 11 top tricks and there are two chances to make your contract: the club finesse or the spade finesse.
Unfortunately, the diamond opening lead has forced out your Ace, and either losing finesse would allow the opponents to cash the setting trick in diamonds.
Since you cannot try both finesses, you should first try to drop one of the missing honors.|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


ht|d|at|@4^^|
ht|d|at|
Obviously, the Queen of clubs is likely to drop, because you have three more clubs than spades.
Therefore, after drawing trumps, you should cash the Ace-King of clubs.
When the Queen drops, you make an overtrick.
If the Queen did not drop, you would still have the spade finesse available to make your contract.|

|n#|3|at|You have 10 sure tricks and there are three chances to make the contract:
LHO holds the King of spades,
LHO holds the @cQJ,
The outstanding clubs split 3-3.
Unfortunately, the opening lead may force you to make a critical play early.|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


ht|d|at|@4^^|
ht|d|at|
|n#|0|at|You can either duck, finesse the Queen or rise with the Ace.
If you duck, LHO will continue with the 10, forcing you again into the same dilemma.
If you finesse the Queen and it loses, a spade return will knock out your Ace.
Then you will not be able to take advantage of a 3-3 club break @- the opponents can cash the setting trick when they gain the lead.|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


ht|d|at|@4^^|
ht|d|at|
The correct play is to win the Ace at trick one.
Then you will draw trumps and lead a club to the 10.
This loses to the safe hand (RHO) so your Queen of spades cannot be led through.
Regardless of the return, you will be able to benefit from dummy's long club.
Note that if the clubs do not break 3-3, you would still be able to lead a spade toward the Queen and succeed if LHO held the @sKing.|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


ht|d|at|@4^^|
ht|d|at|
Thus you kept all your chances alive by winning the Ace of spades first.
If the opening lead were a LOW spade, you could accomplish the same objective by ducking the first trick. But you cannot afford to duck the Jack.|

You should take all three finesses!
Since the lead is a club, you should play the Queen at trick one.
Later you can try the spade and diamond finesses the first time either suit is led.
Note that you will win anywhere from nine to twelve tricks depending on how many finesses work.
You will be set only if they all lose, which makes you a strong favorite (about 7 to 1).|

You should play three rounds of spades, discarding a diamond from your hand.
Then cash the Ace of diamonds and exit with a trump to LHO's Queen.
What can LHO return?
A spade will give you a ruff-and-discard; a diamond will be through the QJ10 up to your void.
Eleven tricks whatever LHO does.
