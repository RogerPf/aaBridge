fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|c|at|

^B@2Simple (non forcing) Stayman:

Stayman is THE convention used to find a 4-4 Major fit when Partner opened the bidding with 1NT
(Here will be referred to the strong 1NT : 15-17 )

More and more, 1NT (and 2NT) are opened with 5 card majors and especially over 2NT "puppet Stayman" 
has gained in popularity.
Here I will adress "basic Stayman"
Regardless if you open 1NT with a 5-card major, Stayman is still a very usefull convention.

1NT        2@c = the Stayman convention

It's an artificial bid with a clear question: Partner, do you have a 4-card Major?

Do you use Stayman with less than invitational hands? 
NO, you simply pass as there are no game perspectives.
(on a very rare occasion you might bid "garbage Stayman", more later)

To be invitational or game forcing (GF) you will need |cp|6|at|^*B8+ HCP^*N|cp|2|at|, you can do the math:
If partner opened 1NT with 15 HCP: You don't want to be in game when you have 8 (15+8=23) 
But if partner opened with 17 (17+8=25) you have a fair chance for game, 
Especially when you have a hand better than a 4-3-3-3 distribution.
 
8 HCP and 4-3-3-3 might be a perfect pass,
But 8+ and a better distribution AND a 4-card Major go Stayman :)|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^B@2

Responding to partner's 2@c Stayman:

Life for Opener is easy, as there are only 3 responses available:

- 2@h = yes, I have a 4+ card @h (and I might hold a 4-card @s) 
- 2@s = yes, I have a 4+ card @s (and I certainly do not have a 4-card @h)
- 2@d = no partner, I don't have a 4-card Major

If opener has 2 4-cards in the Majors, he will bid them "up the line" ie @h's first. 
(Showing spades denies hearts!)
"strength" is not part of the answer! Lacking a Major, you do NOT bid 2NT when maximum!   2@d is your answer
The reason to bid them up the line will become clear shorthly

And what if you as Responder to 1NT hold 4-4 in the Majors, or even 5-4 or 6-4?
Stayman is still your bid!

With the following example hands you should get the idea

Your rebids after partner's response to your Stayman will vary depending on your values: 
Are you invitational or GF and 4-4 or 5-4 (or even 6-4)?

Let's look at some hands where Stayman is the bid, and opener's responses
and how to take it from there....

If partner has a maximum 17 game could be there, but if he has 15...probably not
since you DO have enough HCP's to invite

Very nice, at least an 8-card Major fit. But bidding 4@h might be too high if Partner has a minimal 1NT opener. 
How to show your invite?
By raising partners 2@h to 3@h
If Opener was minimal he will pass, with a maximum 1NT opener he will raise to game: 4@h
With 16 he will have to use some judgement...:)|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |

After P's 2@d, which says absolutely nothing about his strength, you can still invite with 2NT,

Though you didn't find the golden Major fit, 3NT ìs still possible..

Partner, (after you have limited your hand), will take over the captancy and place the contract at the right level.
He will pass if minimal, or bid 3NT when he is maximum|

Stayman is also used when you hold 5-4 in the Majors and an invitational or better hand
(We are discussing basic Stayman, once you get the hang of this there are a little more "refined" treatments 
those treatments would start with Stayman too..so no worries)
If Stayman is new to you, be patient and stick to basic for a while!

A jump, why?
If you had an invitational hand, you would bid your 5-card at the 2-level, 2@s

How about 4NT?|

NO, 4NT is reserved as Quantitative and partner can pass or bid 6NT|

Because imagine you did nòt have hearts but spades.
(Compare with rebidding 2NT with an invitational hand..wrong suit partner, I have @s's)
Even when no fit is found, you still would like to invite to the small slam with 16 hcp...

ooooopssss off partner goes in a King responding....aiaiaiai

Start with a Cue-bid (jump-rebid) to show a stopper up the line!
(any non-jumps would be natural and GF)
Starting a cue bid sequence will tell partner that you confirm the suit, and have slam interest!
4@c (you have to skip the lowest cue bid possible here, 3@s, as you don't have the spades stopped)
This message is conveyed to your partner|

Partner opens 1NT, and you hold garbage....
If Partner is allowed to play that 1NT, he is going to have a very hard time!
He´ll likely go down a couple without any help from you

Under a very specific circumstance, you should still bid 2@c
(?? but 2@c tells P I have an invitational or better hand....P will kill me)

When you hold a singleton or void in the @c suit and have 3+ in the others
you should still bid Stayman!
Why?

To justify this look at these 3 hands:

pg| ***** 49 ***** |


at|^B@2

Partner of course thinks you are bidding the regular "Stayman-hand" and will bid accordingly.
Your action after whatever partner does is PASS

You will almost always land in a 7-card fit or better
And a suit-contract at the 2-level will be superior
If you pass the 1NT, you will not be able to contribute any tricks at all
However, in a suit contract, ruffing a few clubs will contribute a few tricks.|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt||fp|1|cp|2|at|^B@2

And oh well if Partner held exactly 3=3=2=5, 
you end up in a 6-card @d fit with hand 1. 
(hand 2 and 3 still give you a 7-card fit)
Not good, but likely no worse than a 1NT contract though.

Remember that you will not end up in a 2NT contract, 
as Partner should never be answering 2NT to your Stayman-ask.
You are the captain here, and because you will pass after any rebid by opener, 
what ever his rebid is (2@h, 2@s or 2@d, ...there are no other options for opener)
It is not important which of these 3 he bids, you will pass no matter what.|

^b{ 2@d and 2@h, the basic Jacoby transfer bids }|fp|1|ht|d|cs|3|at|^B@2
Though invented by the Swedish player Olle Willner (!) years before O.Jacoby introduced them to N.American players,
they are now widely known as "Jacoby transfers"

What is the idea behind a transfer (2@d or 2@h transferring to 2@h/2@s respectively) after a 1NT opening by P?
Among others, that the stronger hand (partner's, who opened 1NT) will be the delarer
(he will be the one bidding the "real" suit). His hand with the HCP won't end up laying on the table as dummy,
which would be a huge advantage for the defenders!
In other words, it protects partner's, usually stronger hand.
Also, the opening lead will not go through partner's strength, but rather "into" partner's strength.
The 1NT bidder frequently holds combinations of honors (called tenaces) that are worth more tricks if the defenders lead "into" them rather than "through" them. 
For example, if you hold the @h AQ, you'ld like your left-hand opponent to lead a heart for you, but not your RHO.

Playing Jacoby transfers opens a whole new set of bidding options.
They can be used for weak hands, invitational hands, GF hands and slam hands.

They can be used after 1NT and 2NT openers, as well as after  
2@c    2@d
2NT/3NT rebids (which would still show balanced hands, just outside the 15-17 or 20-21 range)  


This is how it basically works:
1NT   ^d2@d = transfer to @h
2@h
or
1NT   ^d2@h = transfer to @s
2@s|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^B@2


A transfer is an artificial bid that says nothing about the suit bid, but yes, about the suit directly above.
After opener ^*Bcompletes^*N the transfer (that's what you just asked him to do), your rebids will depend on your hand-type
All you will need to employ transfers is a 5-card major suit. They can be made with 0 pts!
(In a sense, this would work as the garbage Stayman, better in a suit than NT, and there will ALWAYS be a 7+ card fit)
As we saw earlier, with 5-4 in the majors, we use Stayman if our hand is invitational+
But if we have a less than an invitational hand, forget about the 4-card, transfer to your 5-card and pass.

Jacoby transfers are used with 1 (or even 2) 5+card Major suits.

When you have a ^*Bless than an invitational^*N hand: - You transfer and pass after partner completes the transfer.
With 2 5-cards, in an otherwise very poor hand, transfer to your strongest Major and pass again.|

2@h   ^d4@h   ^gA GF hand with a 6+ card @h 
^g(there will always be an 8-card fit after partner's balanced opening bid)

with 5-5 in the majors you transfer to the ^*Uhigher^*N ranking (spades), and rebid the lower ranking hearts at the 3-level (slam interest) or 4-level (no slam interest)
1NT   ^d2@h
2@s   ^d4@h   ^gYou showed 5-5 in the Majors, you're guaranteed a fit, pard will pass or correct to 4@s 

A transfer followed by a rebid of a minor is a GF, showing a 5-card Major and a 4+ card minor
1NT  ^d2@d
2@h  ^d3@d  ^gshows a 5 card heart and a 4+ card diamond with a GF hand


With slam going hands a rebid of 4NT = Quantitative
1NT   ^d2@d
2@h   ^d4NT = Quantitative and a 5-card @h

Many people do not like Quantitative, because "it is confusing"..
Is it?
If 2NT is your invitational rebid with a 5-card, 3NT your Game bid with a 5-card...
Why would 4NT all of a sudden mean anything else but a slam invite showing a 5-card?
Partner pass if minimal and bid 6 in the suit or 6NT if maximum for the 1NT opening bid |
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^B@2

There are several ways to transfer to your minor suits (6-card or longer) 
Here is the sayc approach: 

For the weak hands:
1NT  ^d2@s  ^g= partner bid 3@c, a "puppet-bid", alert
3@c  ^dpass or correct to 3@d

As responder you will hold somethink like:

@s 654          ^e@s 654
@h 82            ^e@h 82
@d 4          ^e@d JT98762
@c JT98762   ^e@c 4

In NT hands like these are worthless and will not help partner, in the minor they are powerfull

For the invitational hands:
1NT  ^d3@c/3@d ^gpromissing a 6+ card suit and suggests 2 of the 3 top honors
^gPartner then could bid 3NT holding the missing honor and the other suits stopped

As responder you would hold something like this:

@s 65          ^e@s 654     ^h@s 654
@h 82            ^e@h 82  ^h@h 82
@d 543          ^e@d KQ87654  ^h@d AK98763
@c AQT932   ^e@c 4     ^h@c 4

None of these hands have outside entries...
If partner has the missing honor, the suit should "run" and all be well
Note that if you hàd an outside entry, you might want to raise to 3NT right away.

^b{ Super-accepting Jacoby transfers, basic }|fp|1|ht|d|cs|3|at|^B@2

The basic super-accept:
You open 1NT and partner transfers you to spades with 2@h:      1NT     2@h
You do not know what kind of a hand partner holds.
P might be planning to pass your 2@s, or he might have any invitational, GF or slam hand.

If your 1NT was maximum in pts ànd you hold a 4-card support, something like this:
@s AQT4
@h J876
@d A9
@c AQ7

You could "super-accept" (jump) to 3@s. It would tell partner you're maximum and have a 4-card support.
Ìf partner intended to pass the 2-level with a sub-invitational hand, he can re-evaluate
knowing that you have good support might make his hand better, and game might still be "on"

Imagine responder's holding is something like this:
@s K9832
@h T32
@d 4
@c K865

Where responder first intended to transfer and pass...
With the known 4-card support, how good did responder's hand get?
The 6 hcp and an extra one for length, and add on's for the singleton @d (3 in a 9-card fit seems fair)
partner can ruff his eventual @d losers...game seems a fair option
Of course you might have hands where you still would pass partner's super accept and hope it makes.
(There are other methods to super-accept out there) |

This is a hand where you would transfer to your @h suit, and pass when partner completes the transfer
Partner will usually bid 2@h (he might "superaccept" with 3@h!)
The idea is the same as behind "Garbage Stayman", you're more helpful in a suit contract than in NT
You might have a nice long suit, but you miss the entries once it sets up
Partner's life will be much easier in a 6-2+ heart game|

But pass after P completes the transfer again. 
5-4 hands go through Stayman...yes...when they are invitational+ ...not with this one|

Followed by bidding your second 5-card, the lower ranking at the 3 or 4 level 
4@h without slam interest     3@h with slam interest (slow shows extra values)
With 5-5 in the Majors, you KNOW there will be a fit in either one or the other, 
as partner will not have 2 doubletons for his 1NT opening bid|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |

To remember the difference between an invitational and a GF sequence, 
transfering high-rebidding low gets you to the 3 (or 4)level: at least GF
transfering low- rebidding high can keep you at the 2-level = invitational.|

nt||mb|p2sp|lb|*bPlease chose your bid^^3d|mb|3d|at|
and bid  your 4+ card minor at the 3-level. This is natural and GF. 
but diamonds need not be a 5-card, 4 is enough
You showed the unballanced nature of your hand
Hopefully partner can support your spades, otherwise 3NT
With some hands, like a 2-card spade, and 3 small clubs partner might raise your diamonds or bid a @d game, afraid ops will cash a bunch of clubs right of top.|
