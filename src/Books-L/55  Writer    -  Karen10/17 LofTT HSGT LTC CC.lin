fp|2|cp|2|cs|1|HT|g|at|^b{Hand Evaluation}  

^bGetting to the right contract depends on good hand evaluation skills.  
^bWe are taught the value of High Card Points beginning with the 4-3-2-1 approach 
^bthat focuses on one's honor holding. 

^bWe learned the value of long suits (to develop extra tricks through promotion plays)  
^band when we have good trump support for partner and a short side suit, 
^bagain our hand can generate extra tricks.|

^bAside from obstructive preempts and competing in partscore contracts,
^bbidding is all about making contracts and knowing when to stop short, lacking values.  

^bGetting to the right contract requires accurate partnership bidding.  
^bSound bidding is predicated on good hand evaluation, solid partnership communication skills  
^band on the ability of the partnership hands to make tricks.
  
^bAs always, tricks made during play are based on three elements:
^bPower, Promotion and, in the case of suit contracts, Ruffing.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at|


^b{Power:}  Reflecting on hand evaluation, we begin counting our High Card Points.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|


^b{Promotion:}  Next we consider the shape of our hand, adding extras for a "good" long suit headed 

^bby top honors  - a promotable trump or side suit - to gain extra tricks during declarer play.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|


^b{Ruffing or Cross Ruff:}  Side suit shortness (especially in the dummy) also can help generate extra tricks 

^bprovided Declarer has enough trumps to gain ruffing tricks.|

^b{ HONORS }

|cp|2|fp|2|at|^bHonors come in several sizes:

^b1: Primary honors – Aces and Kings are usually more desirable than Queens and Jacks, 
^b   especially at higher level contracts|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|

^b2: Working honors – Clustering honors in fewer suits can earn extra tricks through finessing|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


at|

^b3: Picking up a self-sustaining suit is a special present 
^b   Everyone loves to pick up a long, strong suit that is guaranteed not to lose more than one trick
^b   even when partner only holds a worthless singleton.  
^b   Even a semi self-sustaining suit with 2 losers in an unsupported suit makes a nice gift.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|  


^bShortly, we will get into more details|cp|9|cs||at|


^B{ The shortcomings of HCP + Length: }|fp|2|cp|2|at|

^bWhile counting 1 extra point for each card beyond the first 4 trumps works well for 5/6-card suits, 
^bwith 7+ card suits and two suited hands length point valuation undervalues the worth of the hand:  

^bCertainly a 12-card suit missing the Ace is worth more than 6 HCP (K=3, Q=2, J=1) + 8 length points.  
^bDespite its 14 point valuation, the hand will take 11 tricks even when partner has a bust hand.|

^b{ The Law of Total Tricks }|fp|2|at|


^bIn Bridge we always look forward to finding a "golden fit" with partner, 
^ba major suit with 8+ combined length that usually generates at least 4 tricks in the trump suit.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|

^bAnd when it comes to a long suit: more is better.  
^bIn 1982, Larry Cohen authored the book: 
^b"To Bid or Not to Bid – The Law of Total Tricks" 
^b(based on his partnership agreements with Marty Bergen)|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


at|  

^bAccording to The Law Of Total Tricks (LOTT), holding a combined 9-card trump fit will generate 
^bAT LEAST one more trick than an 8-card suit!|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


at|  

^bAssuming equal vulnerability with both sides holding 18-22 HCP, 
^bThe Law suggests bidding to the level that corresponds to the combined length in your partnership's fit.  
^bSo with a 5-4 fit, you would bid up to the 3 level (5+4 = 9 => 3 level) despite HCP value! 
^bWith a combined 10-card suit, you would normally bid a major suit game (5+5=10 => 4 level)|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


at|  

^bOf course, "environmental factors" matter, the primary environmental considerations include 
^bvulnerability and the distributional shape of your hand. 

^bFor instance a shapely two-suited hand will fare much better than an "ugly duckling" 
^bwith a 5-3-3-2 shape, a 4-4-3-2, or worst of all a flat 4-3-3-3 hand.|

^b{ The Law of Total Tricks and Losing Trick Count }|fp|2|ht|f|at|
^bHighlights of "The Law ":

^b- Place a premium on extra trump:  9 trumps is at least 1 trick better than an 8-card fit.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


at|

^b- Within reason (vulnerability and extra points):   
^b=> With an 8-card suit and points equal to opponents:  compete to the 2-level, 
^b=> with a 9-card suit to the 3-level, and with a 10-card suit bid game in your Major.|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


at|

^bIn competition, consider vulnerability:  
^bUse caution when vulnerable, especially with adverse vulnerability (you are vulnerable - opponents are not)|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


at|

^bShape matters!  Holding a 5-4-3-1 shape is better than a flatter 5-3-3-2 hand or 4-3-3-3

^bThe Losing Trick Count:  Back in 1934, LTC was documented by F. Dudley Courtenay in his book 
^b"The System the Experts Play." 
^bIn the 1970s, George Rosencrantz championed the concept of "Cover Cards" for Responder,
^bprimary honors and shortness valuable to cover partner's losers.
^bRon Klinger's book, "Modern Losing Trick Count" was followed up by refinements

^b@2In the bidding exercises (to demonstrate the value of Losing Trick Count), various hands will be explored 
^bwhere Opener makes a Help Suit Game Try (HSGT) without applying LTC first.
^BWe will then illustrate the same hands using LTC. 
^bLeveraging LTC to find games via Help Suit exploration is but one of many benefits using LTC valuation!   
^bLTC is especially well suited to investigate slams, preempt and opening NT response, 
^bcompetitive bidding and more.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |

^bThe Help Suit Game Try (HSGT) is an excellent method for Opener to explore game after the partnership 
finds a trump fit:
^b(1@s – 2@s…  or 1@h – 2@h…)|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


at|   
^bAs its name implies, when Opener makes a "Help Suit Game Try" after responder's 2M, 
^bOpener's rebid enquires whether or not Responder can provide additional help in the specified suit, 
or show other help up the line towards 3 of the Major.

^b{1@h/@s  -  2@h/@s
^b2NT/3x  -  ??}|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


at|  

^bFor our bidding agreements, we will assume that when Responder has adequate strength 
^b(or undisclosed extra's) along with 3+ card trump support, he will bid game in the Major. 
^bOtherwise bid the Major at 3-level.|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


at|  

^bFrom top to bottom, some examples of Responder's "help" include:
^bAQx,  x,    Kxx (+),  Qxx (+),   xx (+)       (+): Not with a min. 6-7, you will need some extra's)|

^bMaximum of 3 losers per suit x 4 suits = 12 losers per hand |

^bMaximum of 12 losers per hand x 2 hands = 24 losers per partnership (maximum)|

^bOpener 7 losers (LTC=7), Responder 7 losers (LTC=7) => 7 + 7 = 14 losers

^bThe solution is for Responder to use "Cover Card" counting

^bIt also prevents Responder from falling into the LTC-trap: 
^bLong side suits, but not enough entries to promote it.|

^bAnd some additional hands being considered a Self-Sustaining Suit where trump fits are a moot point.|
pg| ***** 322 ***** |


at|

^bThe basics of Losing Trick Count for the opener and Cover Cards for the responder:

^b1. We need an 8-card trump fit, usually in a major suit.
^b(Later we'll consider Self-Sustaining suits.)|
pg| ***** 323 ***** |


at|

^b2. Aces and Kings are not losers.  Ditto for Queens in a suit supported by Partner 
^bor a good side suit with accompanied honors.|
pg| ***** 324 ***** |


at|

^b3. We don't count losers beyond the first 3 cards in a suit,
^bexpecting an opportunity to either promote or ruff losers in that suit.|
pg| ***** 325 ***** |


at|

^b4. While counting HCP has its time and place, Bridge is about making tricks.
^bSo when the partnership has a major suit fit and the opener counts 6 losers,
^bwhen responder can cover 3 of those losers, then 6-3 = 3 losers.
^b=> And that yields a 10 trick game.|
pg| ***** 326 ***** |

^b              A  AK    AKQ...   or a void  (K singleton maybe 0.5 losers) 

^b1 loser:   Missing an honor in a suit, count 1 loser
^b             Ax   AKx   Kx  KQ   KQx..   x  Q (singleton)

^b2 losers:  Lacking two honors in a suit, count 2 losers
^b             Axx    Kxx    Q10x  QJ5 
                   (the Queen is supported by another honor, the J or 10 here, we have a chance to finesse)   
^b             Qx   xx (small doubleton)

The exception you might want to consider is when you have all your honors stacked in a long suit and few in the side suits.

After taking 5 tricks in spades, extra tricks depend upon finesses.
Also, the @c10 is a very useful card, and honors do complement other questionable honors.
It is the pancake shape with losers in all suits, that makes 3NT, one trick less for game the better choice.

{^b Self-Sustaining Suits     (SSS) } 
|cp|2|cs||fp|2|at|
^b@2Everyone loves to pick a long suit full of honors, especially when our partner has opened the bidding.  
^bHere we will learn a simplified formula, a calculation to help us identify when a suit stands on its own, 
even when partner may be short.
We need a method to determine Suit Quality, which would allow us to make an INDEPENDENT LTC hand-evaluation or not.

^bDeveloping Guidelines:|
pg| ***** 443 ***** |


at|

^bTrump fits and Self-Sustaining Suits:

^bTrump fits are fine, yet SSS can be even better.
^bAs you'll recall, we normally don't use LTC 
^buntil we've found a 5-3 or better trump suit fit – typically in a major suit.

^bOn a lucky day, one partner will have an excellent suit,
^ba suit headed with lots of honors and sufficient length.
^bWhile we may feel comfortable making a gut-level decision
^bto determine when to use LTC without a partnership fit,
^bwe can setup a few ground rules on what constitutes a self-sustaining suit.|
pg| ***** 444 ***** |


at|

^bFirst off, we ought to figure partner may have negligible help in our powerful suit.
^bSo unless you bid based on luck, initially figure your partner has a worthless singeleton.

^bOf course if partner has opened our rebid NT, then by all means make an appropriate adjustment 
^bwhen partner is known to hold at least a doubleton in your suit.|

{^b Self-Sustaining Suits and Suit Quality } 
|cp|2|cs|1|fp|2|at|
^bFor a suit to truly be self-sustaining it ought to be limited to 1 loser,
^beven when your partner holds that worthless singleton.
^bSo we don't autonomously figure LTC without a fit or that blockbuster suit.
^bNow look at the formula to determine the quality of your great suit.
^bThe Suit Quality is determined by:|
pg| ***** 446 ***** |


at| 
^bAdding the number of useful honors in a given suit to the length of the suit.

^b{ To qualify as a truly self-sustaining suit, the Suit Quality should be 10 or more. }

^bWhile a suit quality of 9 is very nice, we'll call that a "semi self-sustaining suit".
^bRemember, unless our partner has more than a singleton in your long strong suit,
^ba semi self-sustaining suit isn't guaranteed to generate an abundance of tricks, it may have a couple of losers.

^bSelf-Sustaining Suits: SQ = 10, usually lose 0-1 trick(s)
^bLet's take a look at so-called self-sustaining suits.
^bRecall we have a suit quality of 10 or more and we shouldn't lose more than 1 trick.

^b|cs||at|{ AKQxxxx : 3+ honors + 7 length = 10 }   (with 3 toppers)

^bEven if your partner has a singleton,with a combined length of 8 card and opponents holding 5,
^bWe ought to lose no more than 1 trick most of the time.|
pg| ***** 447 ***** |


at|

^b{ AQxxxxxx : 2 honors + 8 length = 10 }

^bA reasonable self-sustaining suit. True, to hold our losers to 1 we'll hope to finesse RHO for the King.
^bBut even if we have to play the Ace and a small card,
^bour odds are still fair to take 7 tricks when an opponent has King-doubleton.|

^bWith four top honors, the Ace-King-Queen-Jack, plus a 5 card suit we add up 4 plus 5 = 9.
^bYet with the 4 top honors, we still ought to take all 5 tricks.
^bCertainly the odds are low an opponent holds five to the 10 in our suit,
^bso with the "4 toppers" we can add 1 to our suit quality.

^b{ KQJ10xx : 4 honors + 6 length = 10   }   (without Ace)

^bAnother SSS, with a suit-quality of 10.


^b{ QJ109xxx : 3 honors + 7 length = 10  }   (lacking both primary honors)

^bWhile 7 plus 3 equals our suit quality of 10,
^blacking both primary honors, we could lose 2 tricks here.
^bTrue, the 9 spot helps if partner has a singleton.
^bOr if partner opened or rebid Notrump, we'd feel better about this so-so suit.
^bSo let's say this suit is close to self-sustaining but not quite there.


^b{ J1098xxxx : 2 honors + 8 length = 10 }   (Inadequate without primary honors)

^bTrue, the suit quality is 10 but this nasty suit hardly is self-sustaining, is it?
^bWe could easily lose 3 honors in the suit unless the opponent honors crash.
^bSo the exception to counting a suit quality of 10 as self-sustaining is:
^bEnsure the suit has adequate primary honors to minimize your losers.|

{^b Semi Self-Sustaining Suits   (semi-SSS) } 
|cp|2|cs||fp|2|ht|d|at|
^bSemi self-sustaining suits have a Suit Quality = 9
^bSuits where we might lose 2 tricks.

^b{ AQxxxxx : 2 honors + 7 length = 9     }

^bWith 2 nice honors and a finesse opportunity; A good semi-SSS.

^b{ KQJxxx : 3 honors + 6 length = 9      }

^bAnother semi-SSS

^b{ QJ109xx : 3 honors + 6 length = 9ish }   (missing the 2 top honors)

^bYes, we have the connected 9 with the Queen-Jack-10 and 6 cards,
^bso 3 plus 6 mathematically adds up to 9.
^bBut we should probably discount a bit unless partner has rebid NT.

^b{ Q10xxxxx : 2 honors + 7 length = 9    }   (NO, Inadequate honors)

^bWith inadequate honors there is no way the losers here are limited to 2.
^bSo we can bid and rebid the suit, 
^bbut don't figure this suit to setup unless partner shows support.

^b{ AKQxxx : 3 honors + 6 = 9+             }   (3 honors)

^bIf your partner made a NT call, by all means count this as a self-sustaining suit.
^bWith your 6 and partner's possible singleton, and a likely 4-2 split 
^bthe opponents are limited to 1 trick with Jxxx.|

{^b Self Sustaining Suits and LTC }
|cp|2|cs||fp|2|at|

^bWithout a fit, we count our self-sustaining suit as one loser.


^BAnd of course when partner belatedly shows support,
^bsuch as when we have rebid a semi self-sustaining 6-card suit,
^bwe also use our traditional LTC criteria.


^bWhen our partner opens or rebids NT and we hold a semi self-sustaining suit,
^bwe also use our handy LTC hand evaluation because we know we have a fit.
^bEspecially when we have a 6-card suit or 5 with a lot of toppers.

^bConcluding this presentation we will look at the last 3 hands

Assuming West can cover 4 losers, slam is in the bag despite only holding 12 HCP.
Using modern methods, East begins bidding 2@c

all nice working honors,    looking at his Cover Cards:
With 4.5 Cover Cards (2 in diamonds, 1 in spade and 1.5 in hearts), 
North indeed has slam interest and cuebids 3@d to show a control in that suit.|

In fact, if we were to deal hundreds of average 15-17 HCP hands to North,
South still makes slam 50% of the time with his FANTASTIC hand;
Definitely a Self Sustaining suit with a Quality that exceeds 10.|

so Responder can certainly count LTC straight away.|

Responder's LTC:  1@s   1@h   2@d's and 2@c's    totaling 6.

Despite North's 10 HCP, appreciating the Self-Sustaining Suit quality after Opener's 2 NT, 
6@s is a sound contract making 72% of the time.
In fact, with ANY 20-21 point hand, a Spade slam makes 97% of the time.
As you might guess, the odds went down here with the poor spades in South's hand.
Still, a 72% chance for a slam bonus is always a worthwhile adventure even with a poor fit.
So again, holding a Self-Sustaining Suit can be a beautiful thing to cherish.|

North is delighted that Partner has a balanced hand with Club support.
So with a Semi Self-Sustaining Club suit, 3 honors plus 6 Clubs = 9,
North's slam juices are beginning to flow.
With LTC now coming to the rescue, North does the math.|
pg| ***** 488 ***** |


nt||at|
North's losers are:  3@s  1@h  3@d's and  1@c       totaling 8 losers.
With Partner's   2NT   rebid,    expecting 7 Cover Cards seems a bit rich.
But could we perhaps upgrade North's hand finding some extras?
Yes, the @c10 that accompanies the Ace-King should help on a finesse.|
pg| ***** 489 ***** |

After all, after South's rebid 2NT we can expect some @c help, right?
So North persists making a 4@c Gerber Ace-asking bid.|
