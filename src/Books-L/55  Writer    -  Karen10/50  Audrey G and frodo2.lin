An 8-board tourney was held Wednesday, the 20th of February 2013 
followed by the discussion in the BIL Lounge with "Audrey G" and "frodo2"|cp||at|
^*BAll comments during this presentation are either Audrey's or David's.^*N|cp|2|at|
(review was held with voice-feature)
A great opportunity for all BIL members to learn from one of the world's best bridge teachers.


Though not the case in the tourney of course, in this presentation South will always be the Declarer and West the Opening Leader. "frodo2" taking all seats. 
That should make it easier to absorb the lesson points. Enjoy!

South has a textbook 1NT opening bid, showing a balanced hand in the 15–17 point range. 
North has 10 high-card points plus 1 length point for the five-card diamond suit.
North has enough information to take the partnership to game in 3NT.

even in auctions that start with a NT opening bid)|

Declarer wins the first trick with the @hJ.

Three more tricks must be developed, and these can be promoted in diamonds by driving out the defenders' @dA and @dK |

South opens the bidding 1NT, and North raises to game in 3NT.
Play of the Hand: 
Declarer has two sure spades, four diamonds, and a club. 
Two more tricks are needed, and declarer can promote them in the hearts.

On this deal, the defenders are developing the tricks they need through promotion,

nt||at|Entries are always a consideration.
To continue developing tricks in the club suit, West must overtake East's @cJ so that the suit can be continued even if East holds only a doubleton.
Holding the @c10, West can afford to overtake the @cJ with the @cQ. 
If East had held a third club instead of South, overtaking would have been unnecessary, but it never hurts to play safe!|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |

Declarer has five diamond tricks and four club tricks to take.
The only danger is that the defenders may take too many tricks before declarer can gain the lead.
When West leads the @s7, declarer's best choice is to play a low spade from dummy at trick one, hoping East will win the trick.|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt||at|
If East wins and returns a spade, declarer is sure to get a trick with the @sK. 

If West wins the first spade and leads another spade, declarer will have to play dummy's @sK,

at|West leads the @s7 and declarer plays the @s3 from dummy. 
East's first instinct might be to play the @sJ, third hand high, but only as high as necessary. 
East wants to keep dummy's @sK trapped.|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


nt||at|
However, if East wins the first trick, the contract can no longer be defeated.|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


at|
Instead, East must apply the Rule of Eleven to the opening lead of the @s7. 
Subtracting 7 from 11 leaves 4 cards higher than the @s7 in the remaining three hands. 
East can see one in dummy, the @sK, and holds three more, the @sA, @sJ, and @s9.|

nt||up|16|at|Conclusion:
On this deal, the defenders use the finesse to take the first four spade tricks. 
To do so, however, East must make use of the Rule of Eleven. 
That's one of the advantages of leading the fourth highest card of the long suit.|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


nt||at|Taking tricks on defense can be a challenge, so each partner must look for ways to make it as clear as possible how the
defense should go. 
Every so often, however, one defender can help make things crystal clear. 
On this deal, East's play of the @hA before returning a spade, guarantees that the defenders won't go wrong in taking the tricks to which they are entitled.

up|12|at|Playing the @d10 rather than the @dA is the correct play no matter what South holds. 
From the Rule of Eleven, East knows that declarer has only one card higher than the @d5 
11 – 5 = 6, and East can see the @dQ, @d8, and @d6 in dummy, 
and East holds the @dA and @d10.... 
Declarer could hold the @dK, @dJ, @d9, or @d7.|

Suppose South held the @dK and West the @d9. 
Then playing the @dA would give declarer two tricks, the @dK and @dQ.

restricting declarer to one diamond trick.|

Suppose South held the @dJ and West the @d9.

whether or not East plays the @dA or @d10 at trick one. 
Playing the @d10 will let declarer win the first trick,|

but if the defenders regain the lead, they can take the remaining diamond tricks. 
In effect, they have taken their losses early

nt||at|Conclusion:
West's opening lead lets the defenders trap dummy's @dQ, 
provided East plays the @d10, only as high as necessary to win the trick.
The advantage the defenders have is that they can trap the @dQ in either hand. 
If declarer held the @dQ instead of dummy, East could win the @dA

lb|*cHow should West continue?^^hj^SKJT6HJT8D92C832|at|The @s2 won't discourage West from continuing the suit with the @sA-K-Q, 
but East doesn't want West continuing from a broken sequence.
If West ignores East's signal and continues with another spade, 
declarer will get a trick with the @sQ and make the contract.
Instead, West must switch to another suit, hoping East can gain the lead and lead a spade, trapping declarer's @sQ.

East may be tempted to play second hand low, keeping dummy's @dK trapped.|

However, East can infer from West's opening lead and subsequent shift 
that West holds the @sAKJx(x). 
With only the @sAKxx(x), West would have led a low spade initially.
So East should hop up with the @dA and return a spade.|

nt||up|8|at|When West leads the @sA and then switches to a heart, 
declarer should win in dummy and lead a low diamond toward the @dQ.
There will be no danger if West holds the @dA|
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


nt||at| 
West can win the @dA, but still can't lead spades without giving declarer a trick with the @sQ.
The advantage of leading a low diamond from dummy is that if ^*BEast^*N holds the @dA, 
East may play low, letting declarer win the @dQ and take nine tricks.

nt||sk||up|4|at|Conclusion:
The lead avoids giving declarer a trick to which declarer was not entitled, 
and paints a picture for partner of the opening leader's holding in the suit. 
The lead, by itself, does not defeat the contract.|

to determine how best to go about taking their tricks, 
and must use their entries appropriately to get all the tricks to which they are due.|

at|Suggested Opening Lead:
The opponents bid two suits before arriving in 3NT, hearts and spades. 
Although leading a heart would be a good idea with no information from the auction, 
knowing that South has a five-card heart suit warns West to pick another suit. 
Between diamonds and clubs, West chooses to lead a diamond, the @d2, fourth best|
pg| ***** 129 ***** |


nt||sk|s|at|Play of the Hand:
After the opening lead, declarer has two tricks in diamonds regardless of whether East wins the @dK on the first trick or not.
These go along with four club tricks, but three more tricks are needed, and they can come from the heart suit.|
pg| ***** 130 ***** |


nt||at|Declarer hopes East has the @hQ, so that a finesse will be successful. 
Even if West holds the @hQ, declarer can eventually promote three winners in the suit.

The key decision comes on the opening lead. 
West has to consider the auction and look for a suitable alternative to leading a suit bid by the opponents. If West leads a heart, declarer will win the race to nine tricks.|

West can lead another diamond, but declarer has three heart tricks to go with two diamonds and four clubs.

South has only 14 high-card points but can add 1 length point for the five-card diamond suit.

Declarer has one spade, one sure diamond, and four club tricks.
Even if East has the @hA, declarer can get only one extra trick in hearts.

Declarer will be able to take the first ten tricks if East has the @dK.

If East plays the @s7, holding on to both the @sK and @sQ, declarer can make the contract. 
Declarer tries the diamond finesse, which loses to West's @dK.
West can lead another spade, and East can take tricks with the @sK-Q, but will then have no spade left to lead. 
There is no entry to West's remaining winners.

nt||up|3|at|Conclusion:
The opening lead of the @sJ tells East that West has either a solid sequence in spades or a broken sequence headed by the @sJ-10-8. (When not playing "coded")
In either case, East can afford to unblock the @sK to keep the @s7 as an entry to West's long suit. 
The @s7 is more valuable than the @sK! 
Entries are everything when developing and taking winners on defense.|
