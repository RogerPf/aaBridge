fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back 
yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned SAYC, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.

|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|mitche: Bidding: Let's begin with 2@C 
- since 1@C was a naturally bid suit, most players would not take a direct 2@C bid to mean "I have clubs".  
So West's bid is pretty much undefined. 
I think that most people take the cue bid here as conventionally showing either  a 2-suited hand, spades and diamonds here,
or as a strong takeout.
If West wants to show clubs, she can do so by passing and bidding clubs at her second turn.  
And this is all subject to partnership agreement.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  In fairness, some pairs do play that a direct bid of a minor is natural.  
Let's look at what some bids mean: 
a double would clearly be for spades and diamond (takeout).
1NT should be natural, showing stoppers and something like @sQx, @hAJx, @dKxxx, @cKQJx.
2@c may be (by agreement) either what West has here or possibly @sKxxxx, @hxx, @dAQxxx, @cx.
I think that without agreement, it should show a weak 2 suiter (not strong enough for takeout double).|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: As North has nothing more than his 1@C bid already promised, his best action is to pass 2@C, whatever it means.
As it turns out, 2@C will make (barely). 
azin: I thought my double was a support double showing 3-card support.
mitche:  OK, if you play X as support, then it's fine.. I did not see an alert so I assumed it was penalty-oriented.
Support X are alertable - also, neither of you has it on your CC (profile).  The X also gave South a bit of trouble.  
I am pretty sure that if she thought it showed heart support, she would not have bid 3@s.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: Possible bids for South after a support X are 2@S or 2NT.  
3@s sounds very strong, and South has a hand not as strong as all that.  
So I think an auction might be:  1@C - (pass) - 1@h - (p)/ 1NT - (pass) - 3NT - X**
and  West might double to ask for an unusual lead (here, that would be the @C7), and happily beat 3NT 2 tricks or so.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: If South has 4 @s's, North should bid 4@h not 4@s.  
Reason: South can’t ever have a 5-card spade suit on this auction, so hearts rate to be longer than spades here.  
Even with @SAKx, you should prefer the LONGER trump suit.  
And South's bidding suggests that hearts are longer, or at least as long as her spades.

at|mitche:  Play:  At 4@s, West began with a couple of clubs and shifted to her singleton @D - so far so good.
Declarer has only 1 chance for her contract, to hold heart losers to 1 and find the spades 3-3.
So her play must be to lead hearts from dummy instead of playing trumps.

MM: By clicking on the cards, you can play the hand Double Dummy.

|sk||

at|mitche: Bidding:  After the weak 2 bid, a second seat 2NT bid shows about 15-18 HCP with stopper(s) in the suit bid.  @DKJx is a minimum stopper, so 2NT is right, and West has a good 7 bagger - so 3@s makes sense.
As do the passes - so the auction was pretty reasonable.   
BridgeSus1:  I don't know which way is better:  to set the 2NT or play 3@S.
mitche:  Should west declare or defend?  
What happens if East's preempt is @DKJ10xxx and declarer has the @DAQ and @SQxx?|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  I think it is wiser to bid 3@s than to defend here.  You might get lucky and catch partner with the kind of 
hand that can raise 3@S to 4 (something like  @sQx, @hx, @dAKxxxx, @cxxxx).  
On this hand, 2NT is going to fail badly (probably down 4), but that is not really the issue.  
I am not sure I can't make game - 8 tricks in my hand and dummy having 2 might be enough. So yes, I bid 3@s.  
Competitive bidding is pretty tough.

at|mitche: Play: Declarer used her entry in diamonds to finesse in spades, a reasonable play, since South bid 2NT, 
and is marked with most of the outstanding points.  When she picks up the @SQ she has 9 tricks (7 spades, @DA, @CK), 
so she can afford to finesse twice in hearts for an overtrick.
(MM: South played the @h Ace and not the Q at trick 7 (the only reasoning for that is because she doesn't have the Q), making the finesse a very "marked" one)

|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


SK||

at|mitche: Bidding:  I think that the takeout X of 1@d is OK, even with just 3 hearts here. 
The raise to 2@D is a WEAK bid.    So bidding 3@d on unfavorable vul is pretty gutsy.  
It worked out here only because East has a doubleton spade. 
BILAsst10: No Inverted Minor over double?
mitche:  Absolutely not... There are 2 ways for responder to show a good hand over a takeout X.  
They are XX - which shows strength, no support, or 2NT (Jordan), showing 10+HCP and a 4+ card support. 
Over a minor, you really would rather have 5 of them, but a good 4 would do in a pinch.|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So 2@d is weak, and 3@d would be weaker (with longer @D, the preempt) by responder.
IM "on" only in "uncontested auctions.
BILAsst10: Should East bid 1@H instead?
mitche:  No.. 1@h is forcing.   Her choices are pass or 2@d.

|sk||

at|mitche: Bidding: I suppose I open 1@s in first seat with the West hand 
(like everyone else in the world supposes they open it, too), and 1NT is pretty standard response.  
So what does West bid at his second turn?  2@s promises a 6-card suit.  So he should probably bid an ugly 2@c.
East will then probably raise 2@C to 3 (my preference) and hope that West has 4 of them.  
(This is the ugly part of 2 over 1, I might mention.)
Bergen solves this problem by using SEMI-FORCING 1NT, but that has its own difficulties. |
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


nt|| 
at|mitche: East should not pass 2@c, since opener could conceivably have as many as 17 HCP for that 2@C bid.
Again, 3@C is the correct bid by East over 2@c.  
When East raises 2@c to 3, he shows about 10-11 points, which is what he has. 
I also agree with East's raise of 2@s to 3, as West should have had a 6-card suit.
West, looking at a rock-bottom minimum opener, should pass 3@s.  
|
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: So the auction could go:  1@s - 1NT/ 2@C - 3@C/ pass.   I think that would be technically correct.. 
3@c can make if defense slips even a little bit, but most likely 3@c is down 1, maybe 2.
Again -- this is the worst possible pair of hands for the 2 over 1 system.

at|mitche: Play:  North's spade lead is correct, since the auction was not a very brisk one. 
When North discards on the third spade, she should ditch the @D7, not the 5.   (North would love a @D lead) 
Similarly, South should signal for a heart. 
Also, when North does come in with the @cJ, she had reduced herself to the @HAJ (perforce) and exited with a small heart. 
This is a case where you must lead the Ace, not the Jack.
veeree:  I discard o/e with my @d5|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: Please use standard discards. 
First, everyone should know them, and o/e discards aren’t universally understood at an intermediate table.

at|mitche:  Bidding:  West's Jacoby 2NT was the system bid, and also the best idea.
East has a lot of points (15 HCP), but he lacks Aces - so I would bid 4@s to show this minimum opener.  
It's a nice minimum, but still a minimum.  
A 3@S bid should show a hand with about a king more than a sound minimum opener.  
After 3@s, West wants to bid 4@c, to start looking for a slam.  East will control bid 4@d (first or second round @D control) 
and West would now like to bid 4NT, RKCB.
East would show 1 "ace", and West will sigh, sign off at 5@S, and they would make it without any difficulty.|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  For opener to bid 3@S over Jacoby 2NT, he should have 2 key cards or 1 and the trump queen.. and 16+ points.  
If East had @hKQ83 instead of @HkJ83, I would agree with the 3@s bid.

up|24|pf|y|at|mitche: Play:  At trick 1:  Playing standard leads, the @C10 is correct.  
If you play coded jacks, 10's and 9's, then the @C9 is correct.  
Either way, it cannot hurt for declarer to put in the @CJ at trick 1 and then to play a diamond.  
If North fails to put in the @DA (not the easiest of plays to rise), then East can steal a @D trick and make 6 anyway.

MM:  By clicking on the cards, you can play the hand Double Dummy.  To continue with the next deal click the  ^$40

at|mitche: Bidding: We use IM, and East correctly took 3@c as preemptive.
Lesson: make sure you and your partner are both reading from the same music.
I am gonna make a couple of recommendations for this group:  
-First, we use inverted minors
-Second, we use splinter bids
West might have bid 3@d to show the full value of her hand.|

at|mitche: Even though West has just 9 HCP, it is worth about 15 dummy points for a club contract.
Furthermore, if 3@C was intended as a limit raise, then West should not pass over 3@h, even red vs white. 
s_harv: Was my hand worth a 1@c opening bid?
mitche:  Well, let's see: it has 11 HCP, 2 quick tricks, and is a "bergen 20" - so it meets the minimum requirements. 
Since you lack the majors, it's a good idea to get your bid in before you get shut out of the auction.
Even if it goes 1@h 2@h, East is never going to be able to get a bid in--so opening has some tactical advantages, too. |
pg| ***** 107 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Back to West's bid over 3@h.
East has at least 11 or 12 HCP for an opening bid, right?   
And West has 9, so E/W have the balance of strength, most likely.  I would venture 4@C.. 
If N/S bid and make game, too bad, but I think they won’t likely make.
ANON: I guess I should have figured we had at least 9 clubs.
mitche:  Yes.
Again, any agreement would have helped. I ascribe this to confusion over no understanding of the 3@C bid, rather than 
someone doing something wrong.

at|mitche: Play: First, under leading an ace in a side suit works out so infrequently that it should be a desperation play - 
like "pard, I am hoping you can get in to give me a ruff."
So West, lead the @CA. And even better, don't lead clubs at all... Lead the @D8 at trick 1.

Declarer play: with no entries to your hand, your best chance to get one is to lead the @SJ and hope that spades are 3-2.
That gives the defense the option of allowing you to get to hand for a trump finesse or sacrificing their spade trick 
(if the @SK is doubleton in either hand).|
