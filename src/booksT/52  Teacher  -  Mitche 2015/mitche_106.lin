fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back 
yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned SAYC, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.

pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|mitche:  Bidding:  I think that South has enough strength to overcall 1@h at his first turn. 
Yeah, you'd like not to have wasted spade strength, but the odds are pretty good that if you don't get in early with this hand, you won't ever be able to get in. So South might find the 1@h bid.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|
The suit is cruddy, yes, but you have enough general strength to compensate.
At match points, I would bid 1@h without any regrets.  At IMPs, you might be more cautious, but even there, I get in -- 
it's now or never, as the song goes.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: West's 1@s bid is the "book" bid if you use Walsh style responses, and I think that is the right bid with this hand.  
For those needing a reminder, "Walsh style" bypasses a 4 (or even 5) card @D-suit in favor of a 4 card Major 
when the hand is worth just 1 bid.  In other words, bidding 1@d and then bidding spades later would be very constructive, 
at least game invitational.  So since West is not interested in forcing to game, she just bids 1@S instead of 1@d|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|
If East bids 1NT over 1@S, as happened here, South can double to invite his partner to get in the fray.  
If so, N/S may still get to 2@h.  In any event, South passed, and 1NT became the final contract.

at|mitche: Play: When South leads the @HJ, what other card should be in his hand?|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


at|
As this is a notrump contest, South should have the @hJ108 or @hJ109.  
Since North can see the @H8 in dummy, she should place partner with the J109x(x).  
To make sure the heart suit doesn’t block, she wants to play the @HQ at trick 1.  
By the way, the opening leads I recommend are what are called "coded" Jacks, 10's and 9's 
(please check Kantar's books on defense for a complete explanation of coded leads).
Basically, the lead of the J is top of a sequence and it denies a higher honor.|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: The lead of the 10 or 9 is either the top of a sequence or  HJ^*u10^*n(x), or from H10^*u9^*n(x) 
It implies the next higher honor and a third, NON-Touching higher honor, e.g. KJ10xx leads the 10.  But QJ10xx leads the Q.

The old-fashioned (and still considered standard lead) is top of an interior sequence, e.g. the @HJ from @hKJ10xx.  
This puts third hand in a genuine quandary in some situations.  
So we would like to use coded leads and for North to play the @HQ.|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Declarer needs to get one of the minors going as soon as possible, before the defenders untangle their heart 
tricks, so she may as well win the second heart and go after clubs (her stronger minor).
When she eventually leads a small club to the King, South should duck. Then, unless declarer has advanced radar or great 
psychic powers, he will capture an honor with his Ace and guarantee defeating the contract.

at|mitche: Bidding:  When second seat overcalls a 1-level bid with 1NT, it shows about 15-18 points and a stopper in the 
suit bid on his right.  So South bid 1NT.  West might have preempted with 3@d at this vulnerability, but decided to pass.
(I am a MP animal and would have bid 3@d, but that's just me.)  So what does North do?|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


at|
We play SYSTEMS ON in this setting.  North is owner of a very nice hand, with two good suits headed by Aces opposite a 
1NT opening.  So she should -|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


at| you guessed it - transfer with 2@h.
South should be very happy to know that North has spades.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: After the transfer, South might bid 3@C to show a maximum and a doubleton club.  
If so, North may try 4@C (which should show an ACE and a good hand), which might get N/S to 6@S.  
But 6@s is a pretty lucky make, since East could easily have @SQJx and the @CK. 
So best would be for North to bid 4@s when South bids 3@c.|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


at|
veeree:  What is the difference in bidding 3@s super accept and 3@c?
mitche:  You open 1NT on a hand with 4 spades and a doubleton and your partner transfers into your 4-card major.
You want to tell her that you have a very good hand for that major, along with some useful distribution.|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: So a jump to 3@s by the NT opener would say: "4 spades with no shortness (i.e. 4333) and a maximum"
But by now you know that having ruffing values increases the value of your hand.  
So bidding your shortness (clubs, on this hand) says: "4 spades, maximum, and a doubleton club."|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


at|  
The ^*umaximum^*n part is really essential, because you are giving valuable information to the other side.   
You should do that only when you are reasonably sure the information will help your side more than the defenders.
WestElsdon: Never heard of this approach.  Is this a convention with a name?|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Just super acceptance.  Check with Marty Bergen's booklets for information, and most likely Bridgewinners.com 
will have info.
Some people use the jump to 3@s to show 4333 MINIMUM hands, and 2NT to show 4333 Maximum hands.  
So there are several treatments for super accept.|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


at| 
There are also some tricky problems --- like what do you do when your hand has 4 spades, 2 hearts, and partner transfers 
into spades?  And also how does responder respond after a super accept...|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt||at|
My recommended sequence on this hand is: (1@D) 1NT (p) 2@h / (p) 3@c (p) 4@s
Once South super accepts, game should be pretty easy to make.

at|mitche: Bidding: Over 1@d, North has a close decision whether to bid 1@S or pass.  
As you know, I bid very aggressively, so I'd bid 1@S, and I acknowledge that some players would be much more comfortable passing.      If North passes, East will bid her spades, and South bids 2@C.  
East's 2@S seems reasonable, and North's 3@c may or may not work out.  
There is a case for passing:  
It is the 4-card spade stack and @D shortness.  
The defense will start to shorten declarer's trumps by repeated diamond leads.|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: And sooner or later, North and East will have the same length in spades, 
which means declarer could be in deep trouble.  ("forcing defense")
Anyway, North bid 3@C and that was that.

Because she will be able to ruff a diamond or 2, in addition to the spade ruff she hopes to give partner.
OK.. summary of key points.. if you are going to compete in the bidding, do it sooner rather than later.

|sk||

at|mitche:  Bidding:  I was just commenting that a big club system avoids this kind of disaster, playing in your 3-2 fit 
when trumps divide 6-2.  By the way, Dolly, good pass. 
I think that with the South hand, however, I might consider a slightly unorthodox takeout X over 1@d.  
The hand does have shortness in @D and support for the Majors.  
The one bid I would NOT consider is 2@C, because the suit just isn’t good enough for a 2-level overcall, vulnerable.  
Suppose for a moment that South had doubled 1@d. What would you do with the West hand? 
a) pass   b) 1@S   c) 1NT   d) something else? |
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  The general agreement is that over a takeout X, a 1-level bid by responder is forcing for 1 round, and a 
2-level bid is weak; XX is the only strong bid over a double.  That said, choices B and C are out.  Bidding 2@s on that
spade suit, well, I am brave, but not that brave.  So I just go quietly and hope for the best.  
And what should North do if it goes 1@D - X - pass?
Remember the rule of 12 and 10 (Ron Klinger's rule for deciding when to convert a takeout X)?
Well, let's see. The rule of 10 and 12 works like this: Subtract the level of the contract (7 tricks here) from 12.|
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  You need at least that many trumps to consider passing a takeout X.  Here, North has 6 trumps, which is more 
than 12 - 7 = 5.  So we look next at trump quality.   Subtract the level from 10 (here, 10 - 7 = 3).
You need at least that many ^*utrump tricks^*n to convert takeout to penalty.  
Here, North can expect 1 or maybe 2 trump tricks 
(she has no way of knowing declarer only has 3-card suit).  So she should not convert a takeout X ! 
And her best bid then is:   a) 1@H  b) 1NT c) 2@c d) 2@d?
I'd bid 1@h and hope I can play a 4-3 fit.  Remember that pard usually has 4 of 'em.

at|mitche: Play: If I am south, I don’t lead a spade, because it's just too easy to blow a trick and get nothing back in return.  
Ditto for hearts.  And leading a club from that suit ... ugh!  
There is a very good reason to lead the @DA here, and it's not just because the other suits are too ugly to lead from.  
Either declarer had a really strong hand and anything else is too risky, or partner has a trump stack.  
I may blow a trick by leading the @DA but I think it’s much better to let declarer do all his own work.
A trump lead means declarer will never score more than the 2 hearts he can always get, and I don't surrender a spade 
trick, either.|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  The South hand and the auction make this a perfect hand for a passive lead.  
And nothing is more passive than leading trumps.
A final point:  I expect partner to be aggressive in balancing. 
When advancer (4th seat) passes out 1@D, I am convinced she has a trump stack.
CarlieG: If I think my partner has a trump stack, do I want to try to avoid leading trump?
mitche:  You want to help pull declarer's trumps to protect your outside winners and if it costs a trump trick to lead 
the @DA here, you are more likely to get it back by forcing declarer to lead out of his hand.|

at|mitche:  Bidding:  After 2@d pass, pass, West might consider balancing in with a double, which will get 2@S from East, 
which will either become the final contract (down 1, probably) or North will venture to 3@d, which is a more risky place 
to be than 2@D. 
At match points, especially, it does not pay to allow the opponents to play at the 2 level uncontested.  
You risk relatively little by balancing, especially when the vulnerability is favorable.  
And here, no one should disturb 2@s...neither North nor South is good enough to double.  
Also, no one is good enough to bid to the 3-level, either. |

at|mitche: North with 7 losers and South could not bid over 2@D, so it's very unlikely that she has enough to make 3@d.
That leads to the next idea.  Should South pass 2@D?|
pg| ***** 99 ***** |

I think not.  I prefer 2@h for these reasons.
First, the Major pays better.  Second, North may have more hearts than South has diamonds.
2@h might evoke a balancing X from East (it should, for the same reasons as West should X over 2@D).
BILAsst10: Not a very good @H suit vulnerable.
mitche:  I know it's a thin suit.  It's also a 6 bagger, and long suits win tricks.|

at|mitche:  To quote one of my favorite old authors, Geza Ottlik, "Small trumps love to be forced."
And here, please note that a heart contract takes the same 9 tricks as a diamond contract (2 spade losers go on diamonds). 
BILAsst10: So long as you can get to them before ops take out your losers.
mitche:  How can you not?  If they lead spades, you win the @sAce and cash 3 diamonds.  And if they lay off spades, you 
just play trumps first.  |

nt||
at|CarlieG:  What values or holdings are needed to balance at the 2 level  vul and n/v?
mitche:  Points are less important than shape for balancing.  When the opponents stop at the 2 level, they probably 
have at most 22-23 HCP, meaning your side has 17-18.  
And if that's so, you can safely play at the 2-level in an 8-card fit.  Balancing is much easier when you are fortunate 
enough to have spades, because you can outbid the opps at the same level.  Which is why Spades are known 
informally as "the boss suit" or "God's suit" (if you are either very reverant or very irreverant).|
pg| ***** 102 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So balancing means you have some shape and can figure partner's points as 18 minus what you have.
This also means that when your partner balances, she has already bid about 6 or 8 of your points. 
DO NOT PUNISH PARTNER FOR BALANCING!
If you voluntarily go to the 3 level, you need a full opener, counting distribution. 
Example.. East has 9 points here, and if West had balanced, he bids 2@s and then shuts up for the rest of the auction.
He would need a singleton @D or another King to think about 3@s. Even thinking about bidding 3@S over 2@d - X is an overbid!|
pg| ***** 103 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  If you are vul, you need to be a bit more conservative about balancing, because down 1 doubled is more than 
any part score is worth.
