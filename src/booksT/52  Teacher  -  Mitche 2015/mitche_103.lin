fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back 
yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned SAYC, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.

at|mitche:  Bidding:  What should North bid over the negative X?
First, how many spades should South have for 1@S?|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|  At least 5 (most of the time).
So North knows that they should have an 8-card spade fit.
I think that with this hand, it's better to show support, and the best way to do that is to bid 2@D, a limit raise or better. 
Why should North want to raise instead of what looks like a very reasonable 1NT bid?|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  There are 2 reasons:  
First, South is likely to have a 1-suited hand; and second, West advertised hearts (his negative double).
So after 2@d, East has a clear-cut pass (a minimum, balanced hand) and South will bid 2@S.
I will expect an overcall to be a 5-bagger, and if not, well, the overcall suit should be very stuffed, 
and the over caller should have a  singleton somewhere..
It's almost NEVER right to overcall on a 4 card suit with a flat hand.  In the actual auction, South's 2@h 
bid would not be my choice.  Listen to the bidding.  West has said, "4 hearts here, pard." |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt|| 
at|mitche:  So South should not be eager to get to a 4-3 fit. And if it's a 4-4 heart fit they have, he knows the trumps 
are going to split poorly.
I think that after 1NT, South, with a minimum overcall (and no promise of a spade fit) should just pass.  
In the actual auction West bid 3@d over 2@h.  	Any thoughts???
I agree with 3@D for these reasons: E/W have at least an 8-card fit, and West has an Ace and King so the points are probably 
split very evenly, and WEST HAS DISTRIBUTIONAL VALUES.
Also, the odds are very good that E/W have 9-card @D fit, because East rates to be short in hearts on the auction we had.

at|mitche:  Play:  What is declarer's plan for making 3@S?  He counts how many losers?
If the world is very cruel, he could lose a spade, 2 hearts, a diamond, and a couple of clubs. 
How can declarer develop 2 tricks?
The club suit looks very much like he can hold his losers to 1 there.  So he should be thinking about finessing twice in clubs.
But at trick 1, he should guarantee himself a discard by going in with the @DK or @DQ.
Now, he has a discard on the diamond honor, and 1 loser goes away for sure.|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt|| 
at|mitche:  How should declarer attack hearts?|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


at|
Depends on what the play reveals.
BILAsst10: Kind of hard to finesse with few entries to dummy.
mitche:  Yes.. which is all the more reason to set up a @D at trick 1.  If defense leads @D's he has an extra entry to 
dummy.  And if not, they take his finesses for him.|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt|| 
at|mitche:  The play to the early tricks will show East with @SA, @DA, and 1 club honor.  That would almost surely
put @HA in the West hand (if East had that card, he might have opened 1NT).  
So I play East for not having the @HA, and that means I have nothing to lose by finessing hearts.  
Also, if all West has is the @HQ and @CK, he would not make neg X.

|sk||

at|mitche: Bidding: After 1@H, East has a pretty clear-cut pass (even thinking about bidding is an overbid).
And South has to think about showing a pretty good hand.  
1@s is not forcing, but "constructive" - showing some tolerance for hearts.  And @hKJ is quite enough to tolerate hearts.
When North bids 1NT (a bit of an underbid, but not at all unreasonable), South should raise to 2NT.  
And North will bid game.

at|mitche: Play: Declarer has 8 tricks on the lead, and she properly ducks the first @D.  
When East finds a second diamond in her hand, it means West has at most 4 of them, and just 2 remain in her hand...   
You have to count, folks!!
So we all agree that the play to tricks 1 and 2 means West began with 4 diamonds.   
Now, North counts 5 @h's, a @d, and 2 @c's.  Moreover, North knows that West MUST have the @SA.  Why?
Without the @SA, West could have only 11 HCP, not nearly enough to open the bidding with a flat hand in third seat 
(remember the play marked West with 4 diamonds). |
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|| 
at|mitche:  So instead of returning to hand with the @CK, lead a small spade from dummy.  If West wins the @SA and cashes
@D's that is all the tricks the defense gets.   And if West ducks the @SA, North has her 9th trick immediately.
So let's pretend East won the @SA - then the @SK sets up for your 9th trick.

at|mitche: Bidding:  When advancer (South, here) raises over caller's 1@s bid, it shows a weak hand.  2@s can be bid on 
genuine garbage!  South has a better hand than North has reason to expect.

So a raise to 3@s should show a hand with 4 losers or so, because South might have 10 losers. And does.
So pass 2@s with the North cards.  If you get forced to the 3-level, that's a different story, but don't put yourself
in a dangerous position on thin values after advancer's raise.

at|mitch:  Play:  Declarer has not much chance to escape down 2.  Taking the spade finesse was probably the correct way 
to tackle the suit.  Also declarer guesses well to finesse the @D10 to get out for down 2.   
azin: What is the optimal play when you are missing A and Q and have 9 cards.
mitche:  Depends.   With no clues from bidding or play, you are completely on a guess.  Here the only bidding clue 
is the negative X, which should suggest spade shortness.  I would have floated the spade too.  |

Prefer the 5-2 fit to a 4-3 fit.
Since N/S have found a fit of sorts, E/W should have one, too, so the balancing 2@S bid makes perfect sense.
However, if South had responded 2@h, then East would be the one faced with a balancing decision.

at|mitche: Play: In 2@S, West has to lose 2 spades, probably 2 clubs, and if E/W break the suit, 2@h.  So the best way for 
West to proceed is to give up her losers and let N/S do her work for her.  The other thought on the line is to observe 
that when North led the @CJ and the first trick went JQK, the only high club out was the 10.
She might have tried to go after clubs to develop a discard for the losing heart.  
azin: Should N/S pass the 2@S regardless?|

sk||

at|mitche: Bidding: With "reversed Bergen," 3@d shows 7-9 points and 4-card support.
South alerted and evaluated the hand as 10-12, 3@d being the "regular invitational Bergen raise"
My preference (and also Marty Bergen's) is to use 3@C for the weaker hand and 3@d for the invitaional.
Here is why not to use reversed Bergen raises: 
Opener is MUCH more likely to need to make a game try over the 7-9 hand than the 10-12 support points hand.|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: So by bidding 3@C on the weaker hand, opener has more bidding space to look for game.
In my expert partnerships, I use regular Bergen, and I encourage my students also to use regular Bergen.
So please consider it... |
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


nt|| 
at|mitche: The advantage claimed for reverse Bergen, by the way, is to allow more room for slam bidding with the reverse bid.
But games are perhaps 10-12 times more common than slams.|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


at|
Is South invitational or minimum?       10 points with 3 of them in Jacks is close. 
I guess that you could treat that balanced hand with an AK and 10 HCP as a strong hand, 
but my preference is to downgrade 4333 and 4432 hands with wasted values (the 3 Jacks, one of them Jx   another Jxx).

at|7047: What should my lead have been?
mitche: I would lead my singleton @d at trick 1, win the @SA at my first chance, and hope partner could get in to give 
me a ruff.  Leading singletons when you have first round trump control is very likely to be the best way to beat the 
contract because, especially on this bidding sequence, you are not likely to beat it on power.

One other point in play: when East did come in with the @SA, she has a safe exit in hearts. |

at|mitche:  Declarer is now void (he ruffed the second round) and breaking the club suit will solve any problems declarer might have in that suit.
Imagine that declarer has he @CAQ and no @D strength to see why a club lead is very unlikely to help the defense.

MM:  By clicking on the cards, you can play the hand Double Dummy.   To continue with the next deal click the  ^$40

at|mitche:  Bidding:  South has a thin, but shapely takeout X, but I think I would still pass and await developments, 
even at this vulnerability.  You should have 2 QT's (quick tricks) for a takeout X in second seat, and if your hand is light, 
you should have any unbid majors.  
At MP's, you may survive, but at IMPs scoring, it pays to have full values for a second seat double.  
WestElsdon:  Meaning, don't count shortness?
mitche:  Count shortness, Tom, but have an A and KQ and 4 spades when you only have 9 HCP|

at|mitche:  Now, what should West bid after the double?
Before North gets to bid 3@h, West has a bid.  Should it be a) 1@S b) 2@s or c) something else?|
pg| ***** 111 ***** |

Some ideas: If you bid a suit at the 1-level over a double, it is a 1 round force, but it shows less than 10 HCP.  
If your partner opens 1 of a Major and RHO doubles, then 2NT = a limit raise or better.  
If pard opens 1 of a minor, and you have 10+ HCP, redouble to show that your side has the balance of strength.  
2@s would be a weak bid, showing this hand minus the @DAK.  
In standard bidding (SA or 2 over 1), 1@D (x) 2@h (or 2@s) is a weak bid with not much defense.|

nt||
at|WestElsdon:  So XX?
mitche:  Yes, XX.  After the XX, West will get another chance, and with spades (also known as the Boss suit) West will 
have the chance to bid it at the same level  as anything N/S would say.  
So a sample auction might be:
1@d (X) XX (2@h)/pass, pass, 2@s pass/ 3@s.  And if N/S compete to the 3 level, E/W can decide whether to double or 
bid 3@s or 4@s and unless N/S get the clubs going early, E/W will make 4@s.   
One more point: when West bids 2@s freely, East might wish to raise to 3@s anyway.|
pg| ***** 113 ***** |


nt||
at|WestElsdon:  How would the bidding go if I didn't double?
mitche:  If South does not :  1@D - 1@S/ 2@S (2NT by S). 
And then, if E/W bid to 3@s, North might try 4@h, knowing South has a distributional hand.
WestElsdon:  What does the 2NT by South mean?  I'm missing this point.
mitche:  2NT in this situation cannot possibly be natural, yes?
South passed 1@D so it isn't to play. What's left? Just a takeout bid for the 2 remaining suits.  
It is a "sandwich" NT... basically an unusual NT overcall.|
pg| ***** 114 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Something to think about, folks: after South passes, a NT bid cannot possibly be natural, 
so it must be some kind of takeout.
And if E/W bid and raise spades, North cannot have more than 2 spades, maybe less. 
(South knows this because he can account for at least 10 spades on the bidding and his hand.)
azin: As to bidding,  should I bid 3@H or 2@H?
mitche:  It's close.. you have 9 losers (Qxx is not a trick), so I would bid just 2.  
You are under no obligation to bid, so 2@h shows about this much.

at|mitche: Play: At 3@h, North has to guess whether to play for hearts to be 2-2 or 3-1.  If he guesses to play @HA
and a heart, he makes 10 tricks.  If he finesses twice, he makes 9 tricks.

Thanks to Eileen for her generous assistance and to all of you for your courteous attention and questions.
MM: You can play the hand Double Dummy if you wish.  
This concludes this presentation, hope you enjoyed, Karen10 & GG_Bridge
