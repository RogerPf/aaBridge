fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back 
yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
First, forcing 1NT, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned SAYC, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Negative Doubles  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|^b@2^*bmitche: One Level Bid ^*N

Tonite we will have a short lesson on negative doubles, one of the 3 or 4 most useful conventions.
One of the most common problems you face in bidding is holding a hand like @sKJxx @hxxx @dQJxx @cxx.  
Your partner opens 1@c and your RHO overcalled 1@h.  What to do?
Obviously, we want to get spades into the picture. But 1@s here should show what?

When partner opens the bidding, he may have as few as 11 or as many as 20-21HCP, so responder tries to give 
opener a chance to bid again whenever possible. 
If second hand overcalls or doubles, opener will have a chance to bid again => there is less pressure for responder to bid. 

Historically, when responder bids over second-hand interference, it shows about a K more than if no overcall had 
been made.
So a 1-level FREE BID used to show about 8-9 points and a 2-level free bid is 11+ HCP.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at| 
Another old-fashioned idea is that double by responder is for penalty. 
But be honest -- when was the last time you held @sxx, @hKQ10xx, @dAxx, @cKxx and heard your RHO overcall 1@H?  
Probably not this year-- or century! 
So the NEGATIVE double takes a bid that's almost never used and retools it to show a hand holding 4 cards in any 
UNBID major and no convenient bid.  
So with @sKJxx @hxxx, @dQJxx, @cxx, we  double to convey the message "4 spades" and any strength from 6 to 40 HCP.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at| 
NOTE: Some pairs play that a neg X promises tolerance for both unbid suits, but this is not a good idea. 
You could have a hand like this someday: @SKQxx, @hx, @dxx, @cAJ10xxx. 
If pard has something like @sAJxx, @hxxx, @dAx, @cKQxx, you have a pretty good play for 6@s's, even with just 24 HCP.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at| 
What does this mean for our bidding?
In the auction 1@C  (1@h):   
a) when we do bid 1@s, we have 5+ spades;  
b) when we double we have exactly 4 spades, no more, no less. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||
cp|2|at|^b@2
So far, so good, but we need to look at one more auction; 1@C - 1@d overcall.
Suppose we do not have 4-4 in the majors. What're we supposed to do with our sample hand? 
We should not negatively X because we don't have 4-4 in the majors.  
(Remember, neg X promises 4 cards in any unbid major.)
We do not want to pass with this hand. We will never be able to catch up later.
We need to bid; and we make the same bid we would have made without the overcall.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at| 
Modern bidding treats the auction 1@C (1@D) 1@S as showing 4+ spades and 6+ points minimum. 
So notice that 1@C (1@d) 1@S shows 4+ spades in responder's hand, 
and 1@c (1@h) 1@S promises 5+ spades in responder's hand.
And the auction 1@c (1@D) 1@s promises 4+ spades and fewer than 4 hearts (most of the time). 
Responder could be 5-4 in spades and hearts and still bid 1@s. 
Later, if responder bids hearts, she promises more spades than hearts.

^*b@2mitche: 2-level Negative Double^*N.
When the bidding begins something like 1@S by pard, 2@c by RHO,  a negative X promises 4 hearts and about 8+ points. 
Once again, the neg X is unlimited in strength. 
Now, a free bid of 2@d or 2@h promises 5 cards or more and 10+ HCP. 
Sometimes when you lack the strength for a 2-level free bid you will make a neg X anyway, 
for example: @sxx, @hKJ10xx, @dQxx, @cQxx.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|  
(But note--some pairs like to use negative free bids  to show this kind of hand. This means they use a neg X to show 
good hands. But while this is popular, it is not yet widespread outside of expert or tournament circles.)|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


at|  
Most pairs play negative X through 2@s.  Some will use them at the 3 or 4 level, but I like to be able to penalize the 
opponents when I have points and the hand looks like a misfit. 
So let's summarize:
Negative doubles usually promise 4 cards in any unbid major.
They are used by RESPONDER, the partner of the opening bidder.
And they show about 6 points at the 1-level (may be less, depending on partnership understandings) 
and about 8-9 points at the 2-level, again depending on whether you use "negative free bids."

MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.

pg| ***** 15 ***** |


at|mitche:  Bidding:   After 1@c (1@h), we'd like to get spades into the conversation, so East has the kind of hand 
that likes to make a negative double here. You promise 4 spades, not four spades to the ace.  
So East's best bid would be a negative double.
After 1@h overcall, raising to 2@c means "5 clubs, weak hand and at most 3 spades."
Note that if East's 2@c bid means that, then West's 2NT bid is correct.
If East is weak and West bids 2NT anyway, it says "bigger than opening 1NT."
So let's suppose that East had made a negative X and South passed (with 2 points, South certainly passes).|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Then West could bid 2NT to show 18-19 points.
Please make sure you see the differences in these 2 potential auctions: 
since 2@C in this auction is a weak bid, 2NT shows a better-than-1 NT- strength hand.

But after the neg X, keeping things at the 1 level, the jump to 2NT shows 18-19 HCP.
Someone asked "but what about inverted minors"?  Inverted minors are off in competition, so 1@C (any overcall) 
2@c shows long clubs and a bad hand.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  1@C (double) 3@c is still weak, with 5+ clubs, and presumably some shortness somewhere. 
The auction 1@c (1@h) X (negative) pass/ 1NT shows a hand with not enough strength to open 1NT.

at|mitche:  Play:  West did well to win the first @D with the @dK.  No reason to tell North where the @DQ is located. 
Also, West nicely executed an endplay against North by playing off all her winners outside of hearts (except the @sKing) 
and exiting with a low spade.
South can help his partner by overtaking the @SJ and playing a heart (if he had saved one).
So well done, Vee|

|sk||
at|mitche: Bidding:  East's hand is probably strong enough to bid 1@S, and then to bid hearts at the 3 level to show a 
3-card limit raise strength.  So an auction of 1@h 1@s / 2@c - 3@h shows 10-12 dummy points and 3-card support.
East's singleton and nice (3 card support with 2 honors) hearts, 2 quick tricks, and 8 losers are enough for that sequence.  
Remember - limit raise = 8 losers.
West's 5 loser hand is strong enough to bid 4@h opposite East's 2@h bid -- and she did.

at|mitche: Play: After the @d lead, West has 1 spade, 1 heart, and 4 club losers to dispose of. 
The @DK takes care of 1 loser, and she can ruff some clubs (2 of them) in dummy to assure the contract.
So I would play absolutely safely for 10 tricks as follows:  win the @DA and cash the @DK (discarding a spade), 
@SA, and @CA, and then cross-ruff. 

When the @cK falls at the third round, I continue cross-ruffing.  If South overruffs with the @HK, and returns a
trump, declarer still has 10 tricks and if the clubs are 4-3,  declarer will lose just 1 more club anyway.|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: But if the clubs are breaking really badly and North ruffs from Kxx(x), 
declarer could find herself in some difficulty.
And when South cannot overruff the third-round club ruff, declarer still makes 11 tricks.
Look for the safest line to take the tricks you need to make your contract.|

|SK||

at|mitche: Bidding:  Playing 2 over 1, East's best bid is a forcing 1NT over 1@s.  Her hand is not good enough to insist 
on game opposite any 1@s opener.  Without an Ace and with a flat 12-point hand, 1NT will work better almost all the time.

Another bidding point - Should West have jumped to 3@h? 
After the 2 over 1 response, a jump to 3@h should show better suit quality than West has.
Change the KJ10 to KQ10, so that West has just 2 major suit losers then 3@h would be OK.
We are in GF auction, so 2@h won’t get passed.|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  And when you jump below game in GF auction, you are taking up a lot of extra room, 
and the only reason to do that is to show very good quality suits.

Back to East's bidding: the sequence of bidding 2@d and then 3@c is kind of interesting.
3@c is still 4th suit forcing. So I would have interpreted the bid as asking West to bid 3NT with a stopper in clubs.
After 2@h, East's correct bid (if 2@d were correct) would have been 2NT (with the @c-stopper)|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  4th suit forcing is still "on", even playing 2 over 1. How else can you get to 3NT from the right side?  
If East has a club stopper, she can bid NT herself (after 2@h here)  
If East has a balanced hand without a club card, she can bid 3@C to ask opener to look for a club stopper.
And that brings me back to 2@d again.   Maybe East could have bid 2@c (her cheapest 4-card suit) instead of 2@d.
If 3@c really showed clubs, then wouldn’t the auction show 5 diamonds and 4 clubs?
Imagine that you open 1@c and partner bids 1@s. You bid 1NT and she bids 2@h.
Would that auction show longer spades than hearts?|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


nt||
at|WestElsdon:  I thought 2@D would only show 4.
mitche:  Yes, 2@d might be on 4 cards, but then why wouldn’t East bid 2NT (or a fast-arrival 3NT) over 2@h?
Once again, we have to conclude that if East bid 2@d (instead of 1NT), then 3@C cannot be right here, except as an ask 
for a club stopper.
WestElsdon:  I'm just having a hard time following  your logic.
mitche: we agree that 2@d is game forcing, yes?  (And 1NT might have been better?)|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


nt|| 
at|mitche:  So now, when West bids 2@h, she has  at least 5 spades, 4 hearts and 4 unknown cards 
(which may be Major suit cards, of course).
East's 3@C bid should ask if those 4 cards happen to include a club stopper--it should not show a 4-card club suit 
because with 4-4 in the minors, the correct bid would have been 2@c, not 2@d.
WestElsdon:  Bidding up the line, irrespective of points in each suit?
mitche:  Yep just like if you have AKQx, J543, 43, 543, you respond 1@h to 1@C.
I like to have honors in the suits I bid too, but we agreed that East should have bid 1NT, not 2@D or 2@c.|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So if East decided to bid 2@d for whatever reason and she has clubs, she should bid NT with her balanced hand.   
So 3@C should be looking to get to 3NT.
And if East doesn’t bid it herself, the only reason is no club stopper.  So 3@C asks for West to bid NT with a club stop.
Bidding the 4th suit asks partner to do something smart here.   First priority: bid 3NT with stopper in the 4th suit.  
Second priority: with 3-card support for diamonds (East's "real" suit) and no club stopper, bid 3@D.  
Next, West should clarify her Major suit length with 3@h or 3@s to show where the extra card(s) - remember those 4 
unknown cards - are located.|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche:  So in a sense FSF is an asking bid. 
And if East really does have a minor 2-suiter, she could've bid 4@c somewhere along the line.

at|mitch: Play: If North wanted to lead clubs, then the better choice is the @CJ, not the 5.
Reason: unlike No Trump, you should lead the top of a 2-card honor sequence against suit contracts.

(Of course, you'd like something like J108x to lead the J against NT.)
Also, we like "coded" jacks, 10's and 9's for opening leads.
Declarer has just 2 losers, the @HA and the @DA and she took her 11 tricks.

at|mitche: Bidding:  With a disaster of a hand, East correctly transferred into her 5-card spade suit.  
East's hand rates to be dead at 1NT, so she guessed to play in a 7+ card fit.

at|mitche: Play:  North guessed to lead a club, and struck pay dirt when South ruffed.
South then led a small heart and West was on the guessing griddle. He guessed to play the K (correctly, I think), and 
North gave South another ruff.  At this point, South cashed his heart and played another round.

West now knows that North began with 4 clubs and 3 hearts. That suggests that South will have more spades than North.  
So West should ruff a diamond and lead small trump from dummy, hoping that South will play an honor.|

at|mitche:  When South won the @SA, he led the last heart, and West had another guess for down 1. 
He guessed to discard, and North ruffed with his last trump, an uppercut, promoting South's jack.
Good defense.|

at|mitche: Bidding:  The auction prior to undos was 1@s 2@d/ 2NT - 3@s/ 4@S – 5@C, followed by undo to 
1@s - 2@d / 2NT - 3@S - 4@c/ 4@d - 4@h/ 5@s ...
The auction was fine up to 3@s. I think East's original 4@s bid was correct for 2 reasons:  
First, and most important, she has a minimum.  2NT, in my opinion, just shows some balanced hand with 5 spades and 
not honor-third of diamonds.
West showed a good hand (better than minimum 2 over 1) with 3 spades. Remember, with a minimum, West would’ve 
used fast arrival and just bid 4@s.  And when East bid 4@s (originally), she showed her minimum. |
pg| ***** 97 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  West decided his hand was good enough for a slam try, with 5@c (why not 4NT?).
I am guessing that West hoped to invite a control bid from East. 
But 4NT would have been a better idea, because all that West wants to know if East has any key cards (the @SK or @HA).  
And he would have heard the no key card response and have signed off in 5@s.  And East should bid 5@s over 5@c, with 
no first round controls to show.

at|mitche:  Bidding:  SOUTH decided that since E/W had stopped at 2@h, perhaps N/S had a fit, too, so he balanced in 
with a double.  After all, E/W stopped low, and that marks North with some strength.

I like the idea of not selling out to a low-level contract, especially at matchpoints, where passing by South would 
probably result in a poor score.  North bid 3@d (take out partner's takeout doubles) and that was that.
East might have taken the push to 3@h with her 5th heart... or West with his good fit and what he hopes are 
well-placed kings. |
pg| ***** 110 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  At matchpoints, I would have bid 3@h, but at IMPS scoring, passing 3@d is probably better. 
Match point scoring makes you take some very risky actions.

at|mitche: Play: Opening lead of the @CK was a good choice, not just because of the results, but because 
a) it was singleton, and 
b) West bid clubs. He rates to have a club card. 

Leading hearts might work, but leading singletons is an effective attack.
North innocently took a finesse and the roof caved in. 
East got 2 ruffs, and with an inescapable spade loser, the contract was doomed.|
pg| ***** 127 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Two points in play: 
First point:  when East scored her @DQ with the second ruff, she led which card?
It was the @S10. Better: lead a low spade.  The @S10 gave declarer a shot at holding things to down 1

Second point: declarer can hold the contract to down 1 by remembering that the @sJ and 8 were both winners. 
When East won the @SQ and returns a heart, he should ruff in South hand and cash spades.|
pg| ***** 128 ***** |


nt|| 
at|BILAsst10: Would it be better to take @DA and lead another @D to cut down on ruffs - hopefully?
mitche:  As it turns out, playing @DA and another @D would be better, but North has no reason to expect a 5-1 
club division.  East would also lead the @CK from K2.

BILAsst10: No reason to expect finesse to work either with KQ outstanding.
mitche:  Well, the @D honors might be split.  If someone held the @DKQ, they might've bid 3@h.
So I think declarer was kind of unlucky here, which led to down 1. |
pg| ***** 129 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: Down 2 was not bad luck, though, it was not watching the spots as carefully as he could have.
