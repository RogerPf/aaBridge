fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants
in the back yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at
bridge takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO 
or in a club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d)
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned SAYC, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|^b@2mitche:    ^*BForcing 1NT Responses - Part 1^*N


We will discuss bidding after forcing 1NT responses. 

Point 1:
A 1 NT response to 1@h or 1@s could be as weak as 5 or 6 HCP up to 12 points. 
So opener's first job is to limit her hand. 

Let's review hand strengths: 
A MINIMUM opening bid is anything up to about a bad 16 points; 
An INVITATIONAL opener is about 16 to 18;
A STRONG opener is 19+ points. 
NOTE: I recommend that you open all 5332 shape, with opening 1NT strength hands, with 1NT. 
This solves some miserable rebid problems. 

For example, holding @sxx, @hAK10xx, @dAxx, @cKQx   (with 15-17 HCP)
If your partner bids 1@S over your 1@h opening, you have no good rebid! Open 1NT and not 1@h

So let's assume that opener began with 1@h or 1@s in first or second seat and responder bids 1NT.

In most cases, responder will not have as much as 3-card support for opener’s Major, 
so our rebid structure is designed to keep the bidding low enough to find a fit in a different suit.

Opener must be careful about jumps, else the auction may become very awkward. 
The three-level is an uncomfortable place to be looking for a fit. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

In the following discussion, we assume that responder bids 1NT after your opening 1@h or 1@s bid. 

With a minimum opener (at most 15 points), opener’s rebids are as follows:

a) Rebid the opening Major with a 6-card suit. (Note: with 6 of your Major and a lower-ranking 4-card suit, 
bid the 4-card suit and then rebid the 6-card Major to show a hand with 14-17 points.)
example:   @sKJxxxx, @hAQx, @dQ10x, @cx,    opener rebids 2@s.  
With   @sKJxxxx, @hx, @dKQxx, @cKx    also rebid 2@S.
But with @sKQ10xxx, @hx, @dAQxx, @cKx,    bid 2@d, planning to rebid spades on your third bid.

b) If opener has 5+ spades and 4+ hearts, she rebids 2@h (with a minimum hand).

c) If opener has just a 5-card Major and a balanced hand, she rebids her longer minor. With equal strength 
and length in the minors, I prefer to bid 2@c. If opener has specifically 4=5=2=2 shape, she rebids 2@C.  
This, because responder is obligated to bid 1@s if she has 4 of them.  
This is the ONLY time you bid a 2-card minor over a forcing 1NT.
To avoid the problem of rebidding a 2-card suit, some pairs use the Flannery convention, which I do not 
recommend; I am willing to play in the unlikely 2-4 fit to keep 2@d as a natural weak 2.

d) This structure allows responder to correct to 2 of opener’s Major with a doubleton and a hand not strong 
enough to invite game. 
Examples: opener’s hand is   @sQx, @hKQJxx, @dAxx, @cQxx   -- rebid 2@d (equal length but stronger minor)
Example 2:   @SAQxxx, @hKQxx, @dJxx, @cx  -- rebid 2@h. 
Example 3:   @sAQxxx, @hKQx, @dxxx, @cKx  -- rebid 2@d, your longer minor.
Responder will take a "false preference" with 2-card support for your Major. 

Example: opener bids 1@S, you bid 1NT (forcing), and opener rebids 2@d. 
Your hand is   @s97, @hK10xx, @dQxx, @cJxxx.    You rebid 2@S.
That is part 1 on Forcing 1NT Responses.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cp|2|cs|3|ht|c|at|^*b@2^*BForcing 1NT Responses - Part 2^*N
With a sound 6-card Major that can play for 1 loser opposite a singleton (KQJ9xx or better) and 16-18 
starting points -- jump rebid your suit.

Example: @sxx, @hKQJ10xx, @dAxx, @cAx.  Rebid 3@h over 1NT. NOTE: this is NON-FORCING. 

Responder will pass with something like @sKxx, @hx, @dJ10xxx, @cQxxx, but with any doubleton support and a 
9-loser hand or better, responder should raise. Example: @sKxx, @hxx, @dQJxxx, @cQxx. 

If responder has the 3-card limit raise for her 1NT response, she raises to game.  Opener has at worst a 
5 loser hand, and the 3-card limit raise has 8 losers, not quite enough to bid past game. 

The jump rebid of 3 of a Major shows about 5-6 losers. With a stronger hand (17+), you plan to:
a) Raise 1NT to 2NT with a balanced 5332 hand and 18-19 HCP. 

b) Jump-shift  (Game forcing): Note: sometimes you will jump-shift into a 3-card minor to establish a 
GF situation -- Example:
@sAKJ10x, @hxx, @dKJx, @cAKJ.  (I would like to open 2NT, but my heart holding convinces me otherwise.) 

If partner has enough strength to bid over 1@S with 1NT, I will bid 3@C at my second turn. 
The absence of a 6th spade and my extra strength both make it wrong to bid 3@s over 1NT.

c) Reverse (1 round force). 
So here is what we do with invitational hands:
 
Note that a reverse is at least invitational, but still can be very strong: 
you see this in an auction like 
1@h - 1NT /2@s where opener might have a hand like: 
@sKJ10x, @hAKJxx, @dK10x, @cx|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

Note on "semi-forcing" 1NT.  

When you pass in first seat, partner needs more than minimum strength to explore for game; 
but at the same time, third seat openers may be rather lighter than a first or (especially) second seat 
opening bid. 

For this reason, a lot of players use "semi-forcing" 1NT after partner's third-seat bid of 1 of a Major.  
Opener is allowed to pass with a sub-minimum hand or a balanced minimum. 

So if you play semi-forcing 1NT by passed hand and you open in 3rd seat with @sQJ9xx, @hxx, @dKJx, @cKJx 
you should not feel obligated to bid 2@c.

This means that if you are a passed hand, you should raise 1@S to 2 with something like @sJxx, @hxxxx, @dKxxx, @cQx, 
rather than bidding 1NT.  
Because we play Drury, opener will not (or should not) get excited by a single raise by a passed hand.

Responder's fit showing-bids after a Forcing 1NT ( back to unpassed hands).

We agree that responder will never bid a forcing 1NT when holding 4-card or more support for opener's Major. 
We will always use Bergen or Jacoby 2NT to show 4+ card support. 

These are pretty straightforward. 
Your raise of 1@h or 1@s to 2 shows 7+ to a bad 10 dummy points and 3-card support. (constructive) 
With a weaker hand and 3-card support, bid a forcing 1NT and then either pass opener's rebid of 2 M 
or correct to 2 of partner's Major. 

With 3-card support and a good 10 to 12, bid 1NT and then raise to the 3 level. 
Example: Q94, A2, K1064, Q983; 

Partner opens 1@S in first seat and rebids 2@c over 1NT -- you bid 3@s. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
So that is a very brief overview of how you can use 1NT, along with Jacoby and Bergen and Drury to cover the 
3-card raise. 
As a passed hand if I have 10-12 dummy points and 3-card support, I will use 2@C, Drury (2-way reverse).

^*bSummary:^*N 
With fewer than a good 7 points, we show a raise by starting with 1NT response to opener's 1 of a Major 
and then take a preference (at the 2-level).  
With 7+ -> 10+, we raise (CONSTRUCTIVE RAISE).  
With 3-card support and 11-12 support points, 1NT followed by a raise to the 3-level. 
With 3-card support and an unbalanced hand, and 13+ points, make a 2 over 1 bid (GF)
and then a "preference" to opener's Major.

^*BNote on 13-15 balanced hands.^*N  
We use Jacoby 2NT to show a game-forcing raise of opener's Major 
(Jacoby always shows 4+ card support). 
That means you can't use 2NT to show a 13-15 HCP balanced hand with 3-card support
e.g. @sJxx, @hAxx, @dAxx, @cKQxx. 
So, we agree that 1@h -> 3NT (or 1@S -> 3N) 
shows EXACTLY: 3=3=3=4 or 3=3=4=3 shape and 13-15 HCP. 

We NEVER make this bid with a 4-card Major and we NEVER make it with a doubleton.  
So what do you do with a big hand, say @sAxx, @hKQx, @dKJ10x, @cKJx  (17 HCP)? 
Answer: respond 1NT and then jump to 3NT, showing 16+

OK, let's play some bridge!

MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.

at|mitche: Bidding:  The bidding was OK.  If West had slightly stronger @D suit, 
she might want to bid 2@s over 1NT to show a strong hand, but 3@d was OK here.  

East's raise was also OK, but with 9 losers opposite that 5 loser hand... you may be hard-pressed 
to make game, so I would not have been upset with a pass.

West is just about strong enough for a reverse, because of the 7th @D.

at|mitche:  Play:  Declarer has to figure out how to dispose of a loser.  She has a spade and 3 bad hearts,
so at trick 2, she won the @DK and correctly discarded a spade from hand. 
Her next play should be a small heart from dummy. This guarantees the contract against any possible
distribution of the @H suit.

If the heart honors are split, the defense can play only 1 round of trumps and declarer can ruff her last heart.  
And if the @H honors are not split, then the defense either must allow a heart winner or a ruff.|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  The way that you know to hang onto that last heart, North, is to observe that declarer would probably
have bid 2 of a major (a reverse) with a big hand and 4-6 or 4-7 shape.  
So the inference is that she is 3370 when she discards on the club Ace.
You know the clubs are worthless.. that is another thing, you can just throw clubs forever on this deal.

West can work out that this defense can never cost a trick and may pay off if East had a singleton.  
Good idea to overtake.

The @C10 was a winner, and when North discarded the @HJ, there was no reason for East to ruff. 
West will return a heart at trick 4, if allowed to, and the defense will still get all the tricks it is entitled to. |

at|mitche: Bidding:  An "inverted" raise of 1@C to 3@c shows a weak hand with long clubs.
Partners need to agree what they mean by "weak".
In all of my partnerships, I have this agreement: 
a preemptive raise to the 3 level denies a defensive trick outside the suit I am preempting in.|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


at|
So here, North has a defensive trick - the @DKQ and 8 HCP.  So I would not preempt with North hand.
I recommend this treatment, by the way, because here, as we see, it cost N/S the chance to bid and make 3NT.|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Someone said that they play the raise as showing < 10 HCP.  The problem isn’t the <10 HCP,
it's the defensive value of the hand.  
And a preempt should deny any defense.  Otherwise, the preempter's partner will never know whether to take a sacrifice 
or to double when the other side gets into the auction.
Also true - 1@C - 3@c absolutely denies a 4-card Major.
You're free, of course, to make any agreements about the bids you wish.|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  I am recommending that you agree on no Ace or King outside the suit you preemptively raise.  

You give up a lot of information, but you also expect, when preempting, to win the contract.
gypsy1308: ok so the bid is 1@D?
mitche:  1NT  - a balanced hand with 6-9 (or 8-10, if that's your range) HCP. |cp|4|at|

The odds are 2 to 1 that East has the @CQ.
Here is the way to see that.  
When West has a singleton Jack (or Queen) he must play it.  
But if he has the doubleton QJ, he could play either one. |

at|mitche:  So when he plays the @CJack, the inference declarer should make is that he was 
100% sure to play the Jack if it was singleton, but only 50% likely to play it from @cQJ doubleton. 
So that makes the odds 2 to 1 that West does NOT hold the Doubleton @cQJ.  
This is the principle of restricted choice. Google it!

at|mitche:  Bidding:  Over 1@s, I would not have objected to a 3@d preempt by North, but 2@d is OK.  
And East has surely got a pass over 2@d.
What should South do over 2@d?

He has a pretty good hand, I think, and since 2@d could be as good as 16 points, South should make an encouraging bid 
that shows support for diamonds.  How can South do that?|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


at|
I would bid 2@s. A cue bid shows a limit raise or better for the overcalled suit.|
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Either that or a very good hand that wants to establish a forcing auction.
Here is the basic idea: 
If you are in 4th seat (advancer) and your partner overcalls (and responder passes),
your new suit (here, 3@C) is "constructive, non forcing." |
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


at| 
That means "good suit, 7-10 points," and maybe a doubleton small in your suit. 
By convention, the cue is one of 2 hands: either a very good hand, something like    @sx, @HKQJxxx, @dKx, @cAJ10x 
or a limit raise (+). |
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  If overcaller bids anything other than 3@d it shows a full opening hand.  
And if overcaller does bid 3@d, advancer can pass with the limit raise 
or bid his own suit after the cue bid to show the big hand.  
Or repeat the cue at the 3 level to ask for a stopper for 3NT.
Let's suppose South does bid 2@s, then N/S might find 5@d which goes down just 1 
(if E/W work in a ruff, that is).|
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Even doubled, 5@d down 1 is a better score than allowing 4@h to make, and if the defense slips, 5@d makes.  
BTW, that is why I like the 3@d overcall better.

at|mitche: Bidding:  DONT (Disturb Opponents' NT) may be the most commonly-used defense over opening 1NT.
This is a pretty good sample of the 2@s overcall of 1NT.
A 2@s bid may be on real junk, something like @sQ10xxxxx, @hx, @DKQx, @cxx, 
or it may be as strong as South has here.
Double of 1NT shows a 1-suited hand, and double, followed by 2@s, shows a real powerful hand,
something like @sAK10xxx, @HAx, @dKJx, @cxx.|
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  When I asked Marty Bergen about a X followed by 2@s, he said in effect:
a 6-loser hand with at least 1 1/2 defensive tricks outside the spade suit.  So 2@s was right.

at|mitche:  Play:  The small heart seems right, but you could make a case for a club opening lead.
Why? |
pg| ***** 97 ***** |


at|
West is not going to set hearts up (and even if she does, she has no entries).
So it might be best to lead from shortness in the hope of getting a ruff or maybe 2.  Here a club 
lead holds declarer to 9 tricks.  
|cp|4|at|<<So does the heart lead if East plays correctly.  Takes the @HA, plays @cAK and, noting West’s high-low, and gives West a club ruff.>>|cp||
pg| ***** 98 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  A heart is less likely to blow a trick, but also less likely to defeat 2@s than the more aggessive lead from shortness.  Singleton leads are especially good in situations like this one. 
Doubleton leads in unbid side suits are more risky but when they work, they work really well.

at|mitche: Bidding:  A redouble shows about 10 points minimum, so East has about the weakest hand you 
would ever rewind with.
(MM question: Don't most disregard the X when you can bid a Major at the 1-level? Forcing and a 4+ card)|
pg| ***** 101 ***** |


at|
1@d is not a strong bid in this auction.   Indeed, how could it be!!  
West and North have opening hands and East has 10 points, what does that leave for South?
When responder redoubles, it is usually a good idea for opener with a balanced hand to pass, 
to give the redoubler the next bid, so 2@c promises an unbalanced hand, which is what West has.|
pg| ***** 102 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  After the forcing 2@h bid, 2NT is sort of forced 
(with stoppers in the other suits, it seems OK, 3@c would tend to deny a @D card).  
So 2NT is right, if not a bit uncomfortable.
East can pass, raise to 3NT or bid 3@C.|
pg| ***** 103 ***** |


at| 
At this form of scoring, IMPS, 3@c is OK, since it is most likely to result in a plus score, 
but at matchpoints, I might pass 2NT. 
Declarer can take 9 tricks at NT if she does everything right -- But it requires a good guess in clubs.

sure club loser to the @CK. She now has 2 spades and the club to lose. 
Do not mess around with this hand by leading the small spade. Just cash the @SA and claim 9 tricks.
