fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back 
yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned SAYC, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."
Mitch Edelman aka "mitche"

fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|^b@2mitche:  ^N

^b@2So let's take this time for Q and A.
Anything on your minds (Bridge related, please.. I don’t do politics here)

WestElsdon:  Do you play Bergen raises on over double?

mitche:  BERGEN AFTER DOUBLES?

Here is what Marty recommends, it is called BROMAD (Bergen Raises Of Majors After Doubles).

A single raise can be on junk.   So bidding goes 1@S-X, your responses would be: 
 - 2@s shows 3-card support and 3-7 cruddy dummy points, e.g.  Jxx, xx, Qxxx, Qxxx.
 - 3@s (double raise) with 0-6 dummy points, some shape, and 4-card support.
 - 2@c with 8-9 dummy points and 3-card support, e.g. xxx, xx, Axxx, QJxx.
 - 2@d with 4-card support and 7-9 dummy points, e.g. Jxxx, xx, Axx, QJxx.
 
 - XX with 10+ dummy points.  The XX is ambiguous. It can be on points with or without a fit.  
   If you redouble and then raise spades, you have 3+ spades and 10+ dummy points.

 - 4@S Shows 5+ card support and is completely preemptive.

   ^*bIf you do pretty much anything else^*n, it shows a good hand without support for pard's opening 
   bid of 1 Major. (though jumpshifts are preemptive too)|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||

cp|2|cs|1|AT|^b@2      
WestElsdon:  So the 3@C and 3@D bids are gone, replaced by the 2 level bids, and only need 3-card support
for the 2@C bid.

mitche:  Yes, and now 1@S  (X)  3@c shows a club bust, something like x, xxx, Jx, QJ10xxxx.
The idea is to use the LOTT (Law of Total Tricks) to bid to your LAWFUL level as fast as you can on a 
weak hand.
BILAsst10: Still use Jordan for 4+ support and limit raise +?

mitche:  You can use 1@S  (X)  2NT to show a limit+ with 4 card support, yes.

WestElsdon:  Is it a standard part of the Bergen raise system or an extension?
mitche:  This is sort of standard among Bergen players. Marty wrote about it in a couple of booklets 
and his original book, 
Bid Better with Bergen, I think volume 1 (but don't hold me to that).

click ^$40 for Board 1

MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.

pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|mitche: Bidding:   I recommend that on all balanced hands with the appropriate point count, open 2NT and then 
play puppet stayman.  
If you don’t play puppet stayman, then open a 20 point hand with a 5-card Major with 1 of the Major.  
So if Bob and Dolly had agreed on using puppet, he would like to open 2NT and then be transferred into 3@h, which is 
where he'd play the hand. 3@h probably makes on any lead.
BILAsst10: Why can’t one just transfer over 2NT?
mitche:  You can. The auction 2NT - 3@c is usually puppet stayman, and 3 of a red suit by responder is a transfer.

at|mitche: Play: Declarer ducked the opening lead of the @D9 in dummy. I think it is better to split dummy's honors, 
because when North has the @DKQ, the ace will capture air.
And if the @D honors are split, the play of the @D10 will establish a second @D trick for declarer.
Next: declarer unblocked the @HAK and got out with a @d, won by North and a club shift put the lead (and the spotlight) 
on South.
When 2 rounds of @H survived, South must reason as follows: why would declarer do that?
The only reason is to get those cards out of the way (unblock) the @h suit.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  When Declarer does so before playing even a small trump out of hand, it should say very loudly that he has 
no more hearts.  Then South should lead anything but his last heart. 
Declarer will never be able to get to dummy and will lose a second club, 2 diamonds, and probably 3 trumps down 1.

You need to play detective in bridge and ask why a declarer or defender takes the line they do. 
And always to count!
The other clue was North's play of @h5 and then the 7 -- low, high means odd number of hearts. |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Since South saw 8 hearts between his hand and dummy, he knows that North and East have just 5 between them, 
and after 2 rounds, he knows from North's signal where the 13th heart must be.
Does that make it easier to see how count signals work?

at|mitche: Bidding:  When you open the bidding in 4th seat, you should follow the rule of 15.
That is, add your HCP and spades. If the number is less than 15, pass out the hand.
(Of course, if you have a reason to bid, like void, AKQxx, KQ10xx, xxx, you should bid.) 
The point here:  A 4th seat opener almost always shows a sound hand.  Why risk a minus score when you can pass out the 
hand and take a zero?
4th seat openers are not flyweight!|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Now, let's look at South’s hand, with AK, K and a few 10s -- that is a pretty good hand to be passing on, 
because the points are all prime, not quacks.
So after 1NT, South should at least raise to 2NT. I don’t know if South should bid 3NT on his own, 
but certainly 2NT is in order.
North should accept the invitation and make 3NT.

at|mitche: Play:  North has 5 tricks in the red suits (without a finesse) and 2 clubs, so she needs 2 more tricks (for 3NT).
The most obvious way to get them is to take a club finesse.  

So if declarer wants to play off the @CAK and try to drop a doubleton @cQueen and then continue to establish another 2 clubs, that would be better than abandoning the suit.
The thing is that the defense is unlikely to be able to cash more than 4 spades.|

at|mitche: Bidding:  How many losers does North have?|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


at|
North has 3 spade losers, 2 in hearts, 1 in diamonds, and 2 in clubs = 8 losers, yes?  
When South bids hearts, North is entitled to count 2, not 2 1/2 @H losers.
So 8 losers is an invitational hand in hearts.  How do we show a hand with 3-card support and 8 losers, using the LTC 
as a guide?
Over 1@h, 1NT followed by either a raise of 2@h to 3 or a jump to 3@h over 2 of a minor.|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  If I were North, I would plan to do either that or 1@s, followed by 3@h 
(it is possible that South has 4 spades and more hearts).
Yes, the @S suit is four midgets, but as responder, it's almost always a good idea not to hide 4-card majors.
BILAsst10: You say that North should bid 1NT then jump to 3@H?
mitche:  Not here, 1@h – 1@S /  2@h - 3@H is how the auction might go if E/W are quiet.
Now, the East hand is pretty decent, and its holder decided to show it with a double.|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: A raise shows 3-card support, because we use Bergen raises or Jacoby 2NT to show ALL hands with 4-card support  
(or splinters, if they show up and we have enough stuff to bid one).
Back to the East hand.  Over 2@h, Bob decided to double.  At these colors, that might not be best, because West is marked 
with a pretty cruddy hand;  figure at least 21 or 22 for N/S (2@h is constructive), and West has at most 3 HCP.
 
South decided to raise to 3@h over the X.  I play that as strictly a competing bid to keep West out of the auction.|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  In particular, it is NOT a game invite because South has other ways to show a good hand, like redouble or a 
new suit.  Now North's underbid of 2@h creates a problem.  Should she bid 4@h?
If she interprets 3@h as a "bar bid" (just jamming the auction), she passes. If she thinks 3@h is invitational, she bids 4.

he is really lucky and a great guesser, a heart.  How should he proceed? |
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


at|
After winning the opening lead, South should lead the club Queen from hand.  Why?|
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


at|
If the defense wins the @CA, then the @CKJ can cover the spade and a diamond loser.
And if the defense allows the @CQ to win, the club loser has just vanished.
When East comes in with the @HK, he is kind of stuck.|
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Leading the @SQ is not going to work. I do not remember if South won the first trick with the @sK or the @sA
(he should have won it with the @sA)
WestElsdon:  I took with the @sA
mitche:  So East knows the @sQ sets up 2 spade tricks in dummy (if South has the K too)
btour:  I want to keep him out of dummy and I want a diamond lead.|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  OK, then there is an excuse for the spade, and a LOW spade puts South to the test -- 
the Q means he cannot go wrong...

South leads club Queen at trick 2 to assure the contract, and East plays a LOW spade at trick 4.
OK, thanks to the players for tackling these hands and facing some difficult problems in bidding and play. |

at|mitche: Bidding:  East's 2NT was the unusual 2NT, of course, and South has nothing to say.
West bids only 3@D, because East might have bid on real junk (take away the @hAce, and East still bids 2NT).
East cannot raise, because West might have bid 3@d on real junk, too (take away the @SA).

So they are stuck at 3@d.
South still has junk and should not bid 3@S, so 3@d becomes the final contract.
The auction was pretty much what I think it should be.

at|mitche: Play:  At trick 1, what should North lead?
Let us reason together.. .... 
East has the minors, and North has stuff in clubs. So he should not lead a suit dummy will want to set up, most likely.
So despite the strong Club holding, it is probably best to look elsewhere.
A spade might be right, but I would guess to lead either the @hK (to set up a trick for the defense) or a trump.
The standard lead with a good holding in declarer's side suit is a trump, but here it won't do too much to stop ruffs. 
I lead a heart honor.|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


nt||
at|BILAsst10: East has only 3 cards in majors – likely.
mitche:  True, but I know my club tricks cannot run away.

If declarer has 5 hearts to the @hAJ10 and dummy a heart singleton, the @hK will not help, but neither will a club.
After the heart opening lead, declarer is sure to lose 3 tricks. And with the @h shift at trick 2, declarer will make 
10 tricks.|

at|mitche: Bidding:  2@h is the correct bid by East.  She doesn’t have enough for a Drury 2@c bid.
West has nothing to say.
North has a bit of a problem. He would like to balance, but no clear way to do it.  At matchpoints, I have been known to 
bid 3@D here and gone for 500 on a part score hand but I  also have pushed the opps to a failing 3@h.
So you pays your money and takes your chances. 
Here, the North hand is too flat to bid over 2@h (and he has the death holding in hearts, to boot).
Balancing is a very delicate business sometimes and this is one of those times.|

nt||
at|mitche:  But note that if 3@D is undoubled, E/W have allowed themselves to be robbed blind.  And if they push on to 3@h, they go down.
jonnyquest: Should South open 1@C?
mitche:  South has a bergen 20, but in second seat, where you really do need a sound opening, at IMPS I pass.  
At matchpoints, I might open 1@C.  But I certainly would understand passing with a lot of quacks and not good suits.
North found the best opening lead against 2@h - anything else, E/W make 3.

sk||
at|mitche: Bidding:  South's second bid should be something other than 3@c.  My choice would be 3@s to establish 
a GF auction.  
North would scratch his head and bid 3NT to show a spade stop. 
South would then be able to bid 4@c as an advance cue bid.|
pg| ***** 114 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  I think that the easiest path to 6@H is 4NT.  North will show 1 key card, and South then asks about the 
trump Q to get to 6.
So one possible auction 1@D 1@h (2@s) 4NT (which must be key card for hearts)/ 5@c (if you play 1430, which you should), 
5@D (asking for the @HQueen) 6@h.|

at|mitche: Play:  How do I plan as declarer?  I first think that I have a cross-ruff, needing only for the spades not to 
be 7-1, in which case East might have bid 3, not 2.
Note that if declarer does intend to cross ruff, he has to cash his outside winners before starting the cross 
ruff, else the defenders might discard a side suit and ruff one of your winners.

BILAsst10:  Declarer has all the high @H except for the 2 which you use for 2nd @S assuming West has 2 of them.|
pg| ***** 129 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Yes, that is it.  Nine  trumps, the spade, diamond, and club aces (you cannot set up the @D and get back 
to enjoy it without pulling trumps.
Therefore the @d finesse and a @c discard on the @dA, the @cA and the cross ruff, eventually losing a @c-trick

MM:  You can play the hand Double Dummy if you wish
This concludes this presentation, hope you enjoyed, Karen10 & GG_Bridge
