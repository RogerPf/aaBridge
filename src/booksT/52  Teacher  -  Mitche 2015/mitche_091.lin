fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned SAYC, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."
Mitch Edelman aka mitche 


MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.
Thank you Eileen (wyoming33) for sending the hands and editing the chatlog! @h

pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at|mitche: Bidding:   In third seat, the usual guidelines for a weak 2 bid are relaxed, so South's 2@d bid is perfectly 
normal -- even with a thin suit and few points.  West has a pretty good hand.  With her hand, I bid 2@h. 
The guideline I use is with a good 5 card suit, I need only about 10 points to come in freely over a third seat weak 2. 

And sometimes, if the suit is nice (or 6 cards), I will bid with even fewer HCP.  So 2@h looks OK.
If West bids 2@h, North should raise to 3@d - but in the actual auction, with 8+ losers, pass is probably OK.  
At matchpoints, however, I bid 3@d without any problem (Law of Total Tricks bid).|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  East correctly balanced in with 2@S (you cannot afford to let your opponents steal from you)  and West's 
having not overcalled now comes back to haunt her. 
It turns out that 4@h is making, losing just a diamond and club ... and maybe a heart.

I guess the lessons are "it's a bidder's game" and "Don't be afraid to overcall a weak 2 with a good hand."  
If you wait for a better holding, you may wait a long time. You don’t need much more than T9x to win 4 trumps.

at|mitche: Bidding:  A Stayman 2@C followed by 2NT shows about 8+ - 9 points. 
So South has that kind of hand and bids it that way.  North, with a good 5-card suit and 16 HCP  has enough to bid 3. 
You accept with any 17 or a good 16.. and what makes a 16 HCP hand good is a 5-card suit with at least 2 honors 
and a 9 or any 3 honors.

at|mitche: Play:  East led a 4th best @S8 which forced the @sJack from declarer.
Mary counts 7 winners on the lead:  5 diamonds, 1 spade, 1 club.  
What is her plan to win 9?

She tries first to win a heart trick and if East has the @HA, then another spade.  
But the @HK loses and the contract is in danger.
West should lead a spade, partner's opening lead.  And if she does, declarer will lose 3 spades and the @HAQ.|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  If West were on OPENING lead, a club would be OK, but unless you have a good reason not to, it's usually 
right to return opening leader's suit.  What's a good reason? |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


at|
Strength in dummy in opening leader's suit or a very good suit of your own WITH an entry.
CarlieG:  How can I tell if the @S8 lead is not top of nothing or 4th best?

mitche:  Well, you can see 6 spades in your hand and dummy, and 5 of them are lower than the 8.  So pard is not leading 
top of nothing.  She might have led from shortness, but after a Stayman auction, if she has a good minor, she will lead it.|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So the clues are: 
a) look at all the lower spots, 
b) pard doesn’t have a good minor suit to lead and most important, 
c) declarer has at most 3 spades -- she did not respond 2@s to Stayman.

at|mitche: Bidding:  East in 4th seat has a big hand and guesses to make an offshape double. 
After the X, I think South should bid 3@s immediately. 
Why?|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


at|
A) she has a probable 9-card fit, so she is "LAW safe" and
b) East - West won’t know about a fit at the 3 level. 
They will have to risk the 4-level, vulnerable, on a possible misfit.  Note that any 4-level E/W contract is doomed.
So South wants to advance the preempt.  Keep that in mind, raising a preempt can be made on some pretty cheesy hands.|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Anyway, West bid 3@D and East (probably gnashing her teeth) decided to pass. 
Now, when South bids 3@S, East decided to defend on the E/W misfit.

at|mitch:  Play:   Opening lead: if West has the @DK, then the @DA and a diamond may be the best defense 
(East would possibly get a ruff with her @S2).
A round suit lead is too repellent to consider, and the @SA and a second round of trumps is the only other reasonable 
lead strategy.

Declarer: do not lead clubs.  The double locates the @HA (and maybe the Queen, too) so if you want to get to dummy to 
lead toward your spade honors, use the heart suit.|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Also, a very subtle little swindle that may work against players who aren't paying attention: cover the 
second @D (the 4 at trick 2) with the Jack. A sleepy West might cover reflexively, allowing you to set up a discard for 
a losing club. 
Of course West should realize the only @d she hasn’t seen is the @DK, and North MUST have that card.

at|mitche: Bidding:  South has a pretty weak hand so passing might be the best strategy, but 1@S is also reasonable.
But after 3@C rebid by North, South should bid 3@h, not 3@s. Why?

North has shown a strong 2-suiter and South has no reason to suspect spade support.
So IF North bids 3@c (I think it is a bit of an overbid), South must choose between clubs and hearts; 
3@s should show a much better suit here.

at|mitche:  Play:  Was leading trump good, or not so good?
Well, let's see if we can work out an opening lead for West: 

A @h is out. North advertised a good suit, or at least a long one, and some points.
A @c -- declarer's second suit is not a good idea (don't help declarer by leading the suits they bid strongly) 
A @d from Axx is probably wrong because North is known to be short in diamonds.
So a @s attack is actually the best lead. |
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  How should declarer think about the contract?
He has a sure trump loser and at least 3 diamond losers -- too many, and after the trump lead and continuation, he can 
ruff only once.
So let's "stand on our heads" and look at dummy as the "master hand" (Dummy Reversal)
Dummy has 3 clubs, 2 hearts, 1 diamond and a spade to worry about. (7 losers)
But what if declarer can win 5 hearts, the @CA, and ruff 2 clubs in his own hand?  That brings the count to 10 tricks.  
This means setting up the heart suit.  If @H's divide reasonably and Jack is in the West hand, it might work. |
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So the best line for declarer:  

Take a 2nd spade with @sJ;  play @CAce;  ruff a club; heart to Ace; club ruff; play the @H10: |
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


pf|y|at|
a) If covered by West with the @hJ, overtake with @hQ, draw last trump and run good hearts for 10 tricks; 
b) If not covered, let the @h10 run, draw last trump with king in dummy and run the good hearts again for 10 tricks.  
If the @HJ is with East then the contract will be down one.|

sk||

at|mitche: Bidding:  It's pretty hard to get to 6@h here -- even though it is cold. 
East can help a bit in the bidding with a 3@s bid instead of the 4@h bid.  That bid here means "good raise for hearts". 
I think it is now pretty standard to use  an immediate cue bid as "limit raise or better" both for opener's and 
overcaller's suits.
What would happen over a 3@s cue bid?
Unless you use Italian cue bids and both E/W partners take very optimistic views of their hands, it's still unlikely 
that they would get to 6 using standard methods.|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


nt||
at|WestElsdon:  Bid controls?
mitche:  Yes, control bidding: West shows second round @C control (4@C) and East shows second round control of @D (4@D).  
But East's giraffe is very hard to describe. 
btour:  Does west have a double and correct hand?

mitche:  West has a hand that is pretty close to doubling and then bidding hearts.  With 16 points, the @SQ favorably 
located, and 5 losers, it's close.|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  I think that double followed by your own suit should show about 4-5 losers.
So it's pretty close. I might be more inclined to do it vulnerable than non because of the vul game bonus. 
WestElsdon:  The 3@S bid by East says “I have Hearts?”

mitche:  Some partnerships use it to ask for a stopper for 3NT,  and if so, West would bid 3NT, and East would then show 
the @h support.|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Steve Robinson suggests that overcaller should treat it as stopper ask by unpassed advancer, as almost 
opening hand by passed partner. 
His book "Washington Standard" has a lot of very good ideas, but many of them are not "standard" 2 over 1 
or standard anything, for that matter.

WestElsdon:  Nothing about hearts?  Just strength?
mitche:  A 3@s cue by East here would show hearts.

at|mitche: Bidding: East's 2@s bid was absolutely 100% correct - a "constructive" raise 
-- showing 7-10 points and 3 spades.  
What should North bid in balancing position?
a) should he pass? 
b) double? or 
c) something else,    and if so, what?|

at|mitche: We agree that pass is out.
I think X is right, because KQx is good enough @h support.
With 4-5 in the minors (1=3=4=5 shape), then I would think about 2NT (for the minors).|

So X is OK, and East likes her hand enough to bid 3@s - a bit uncomfortably, but that is what balancing does to you.|

BILAsst10: How about double after 1@S?
mitche:  A double of 1@S should have 4 hearts I think, so I agree with passing 1@s.

Note that with East having 4 hearts, it is very unlikely that West will have more than 1 heart loser.. 
so this isn't the dreaded "death holding."

at|mitche: Play:  How many losers does declarer have?
I count 5 losers .. the @DJ covers one of the 2 losers in that suit.  
Those small diamonds won’t go away on their own, you know.

And you don’t know about the @S finesse, so you count a potential @S loser, 1 heart loser, a club, 
and possibly 2 diamonds, depending on how you play the suit.
So the plan should be: I will finesse in spades and diamonds.|

at|mitche:  She wins the heart, floats the @S10 and when that wins, declarer has her 9th trick.
How should she play diamonds?|
pg| ***** 127 ***** |

Well, here is my thinking: 
I am guessing that NORTH, who doubled, has the @DK.  
Of course, that isn't ironclad, because a balancing X could be quite weak, possibly as few as 7 or 8 HCP.
But I think there's a good chance the "normal" @D finesse is losing so I will lead TOWARD the @DJ, 
hoping North produces the @DK.|
pg| ***** 128 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  If the @DJ is allowed to win, I will give up my heart loser and hope that North will eventually get stuck
with the lead and have to play @D himself.  But if Bob plays the @DK early, West will win 10 tricks. 
If declarer finds herself in 4@s she would have to play that way, and also not pull all 3 rounds of trumps 
(ruffing @d).

So the play at 4@S would be: win the @HA, finesse in spades, lead a small @D.  
If North ducks the @DK, West can ruff diamonds in dummy and if North wins the K, West doesn't need to. |

nt||
at|mitche:  So think about a finesse in a slightly different way: leading toward the @DJ here is an unusual finesse, but 
it is still leading toward a lower honor with the hope that the higher honor is in front of it. 

Thanks to Eileen for her generous assistance and to all of you for your courteous attention and participation.

MM: You can play the hand Double Dummy if you wish.
This concludes this presentation, hope you enjoyed, Karen10 & GG_Bridge|
