fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back 
yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned SAYC, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|lb|*bWhat should South bid?^^p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p

|sk||at|mitche: Bidding: Let's look at South's bid after 1@S.  
We would like to have a better spade holding than singleton Ace for the 1NT bid.  So that bid is not the best.  
So we need to find some other bid with South's hand.  
North bid 1@h, and we sort of like hearts.  After the 1@S overcall, a 2@h bid by South should show a 4 card-support 
And a double of 1@S overcall, if natural, shows a LOT of spades, right?  
How often do you have enough spades to double 1@s for penalty when you don't have enough of them to open 1@S?  
About NEVER, that's how often. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  If South has enough spades for a natural double of 1@S, then he probably has enough of them to open 1@S.
So we now believe that South cannot make a natural double of 1@S in this auction, cannot reasonably raise 1@h to 2, 
and would like to show  something in hearts, just in case North has 5 of them.  How can we do this?|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|  
We use the not-useful double of the overcall by 4th seat to show exactly 3 cards in responder's bid suit.
This is called a "Support" double, and it is quite useful.
It uses an "impossible" bid to convey an important bit of information to responder.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Here is how it works.. Opener bids 1 plum. pass by overcaller, and responder bids 1 or 2 grapes.
4th hand (the "advancer") makes an overcall of some number of a third suit, bananas.  
Opener doubles bananas, advancer's overcall suit. 
The message is "I have exactly a 3-card support for your grapes pard.”    If opener does NOT make the support X, 
it denies a 3-card support for responder's suit.  It's still possible for opener's side to get to NT (or 1 fruit salad 
here) if that's right, because responder will know if his side is in a 4-3 fit or a 5-3 fit.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  The ONLY time a support double happens is when OPENER can double a 4th seat overcall, as we saw here .  
OR - the auction goes 1 plum (1 banana overcall) 1 or 2 grapes by responder, 2 bananas by advancer,
e.g. 1@c (1@d) 1@h (2@d).
NOW, X by opener shows 3-card support for hearts. (That is the basic model.)
There is a critter called the support redouble.  And it happens when advancer doubles instead of overcalls.  
We use support doubles ONLY thru the 2-level.  3-level doubles are not support X.  
ONLY OPENER MAY MAKE SUPPORT X or XX.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||
at|heelboy:  What does responder bid after the support double?
mitche:  Responder can do whatever seems best - either a natural NT, a raise of opener's suit,  rebidding his suit, 
or the 4th suit (which is now looking for a stopper in the overcalled suit).|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|
Here, let's suppose that South had made a support X.  
Then responder bids 2@d - or if West bids 2@s, you pass with your weak hand.
One other point in the bidding--when North passes over 3@d,  South should just call it a day and allow E/W to play 3@s

at|mitche:  Play:  Declarer wins the opening lead and plays 2 rounds of trumps, finishing off that suit.  We are at trick 4.
Declarer just played 2 rounds of trumps.  The heart situation involves some guessing ... Notice that it would be a lot 
better for him if the defense led hearts.  
Declarer has 2 sure club losers.  Lead a CLUB, not a heart.  After the @CAK are gone, if you're lucky, the @C9 will be 
ready to fall (it does).  Declarer can discard 2 hearts on the @CQ and @C8, and if the 9 is not friendly, declarer can 
cross-ruff spades and clubs.|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Defense will need to lead a heart sooner or later, which can only help declarer solve the heart suit.  
So the rule here is 
"LOSE YOUR SURE LOSERS EARLY."

Best play for declarer: win @SA - cross to the @DQ and ruff a spade. Then @DK and a club. 
If the defense helps you by leading a spade, declarer ruffs that and leads another club.|

sk||

at|mitche: Bidding: First, even at favorable vulnerability, at IMPS, a 1@S overcall should show a better suit than KJ763  
I think a minimum is 3 of top 5 honors, so at least QJ10xx .. and if the suit is that weak, you need at least one outside 
A or K to overcall.  So West might do better in the long run to pass this hand.  
Here, the 1@S overcall pinpointed all the honors in the suit for declarer.  
At IMPs you want to have some protection against being killed.  
Here, E/W would be lucky to take 3 tricks and if playing in 1@SX, would be giving up 800.|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: OK.. I guess North has to do something over 1@S, and his choices are 
some number of diamonds, some number of NT, or an ambiguous 2@S bid.
2@d should show better @D's, the 2@s cue will force, but it'll also temporarily give opener the wrong message 
(as 2@s should show a limit raise or better in hearts).  
And any number of NT is wrong:  3NT kills any chance of finding a slam, if that's on.  
So 2@d is forcing..which is good enough for now.  A X is very reasonable too.|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Over opener's 2NT, North should reason that South has less than a 1NT opener and settle for 3NT, 
so the N/S bidding was very reasonable to reach a reasonable contract.
BILAsst10: What would  a X of 1@s show? tell?  ask?
mitche:  A double of 1@S is Negative, showing support for the minors.  
I think it would be OK, especially if North then bid some large number of NT.
BridgeSus1: Is it normal for South to bid 2NT with only two small @C?
mitche: Well, it's not my first choice.|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt||at|BridgeSus1:  What would you bid then?
mitche: If 2@d promised 5 of them (it should), then South should probably bid 3@d. 
North would then bid 3NT (I hope he would).
So a reasonable auction (including 1@S overcall) might be 1@h (1@s) X p / 1NT - 3NT.

at|mitche: Play: West led the @S6, as you recall.  Declarer counts his winners: 4 diamonds, 2 hearts, a club, and 3 spades.
Why 3 spades? |
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


at|
WestElsdon: Rule of 11 says 5 higher spades than the 6 and he has them all.
mitche:  Right, Tom ... So in order not to waste the power of his @S8, declarer should allow the opening lead to run to 
his hand, win the first spade, and play a couple of rounds of hearts 
(I confess  I would play @HA, and then run the Jack, losing to the doubleton Queen).  
That sets up 4 hearts, then I would make a spade play.|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Even if West shifts to a club, the contract is cold. 
One other point on defense.  When Declarer played the @HAK and crashed the @HQ and J, she should take advantage of the 
fact that declarer did not finish off the @D suit and  get out safely with a diamond or club 
(that is after winning the @CK).  That would hold declarer to 11 tricks.

SK||

at|mitche: Bidding: First, North has a better bid than 1NT -- 1@s. 
You really don't want to conceal a 4-card spade suit. 
WestElsdon: Doesn't that promise 5+?
mitche:  NO!!!
Let me be clear - unless you use the Flannery convention (which I refuse to do), 1@S response shows 4 or more.  
So 1@h - 1NT says "no 4 card spade suit."  Playing 2 over 1 (which we are doing here ), 1NT over a first or second seat
opener of 1@h or 1@s (followed by pass) is 100% forcing for 1 round.  And 2@d is the correct rebid. |
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  North now has a bit of a problem... and 2NT is probably the only bid he has left - passing could result in 
playing a 3-3 fit.  Some North players might try 2@h over 2@d, and that would not be horrible.
BILAsst10: If North bids 1@S, South  bids 1NT and that is where it is played?
mitche:  If North bids 1@S, I think South should bid 2@d anyway, with a weak hand and 1543 shape.
This is an ugly hand for any bidding system.  If you play standard, then North might bid 2@C over 1@h and it would be 
very hard to stop below 3 level, and that still is going down 2, most likely.  Maybe 1 if declarer guesses everything well.
So this is just a bitchy hand.

at|mitch: Play: At 2NT, East wants to lead spades, and from 1098x, the book lead is the 10, for 2 reasons:  
a) top of a 3 card sequence, and b) no higher honor. If you play "coded" leads, then the 10 is also standard.
Declarer's best chance to swindle the defense (he is doomed if the defense finds hearts) might be to win 
the first spade, cross to dummy with a diamond, and finesse a club into East's hand.
East might decide to lead a SMALL heart from @hAQ. Or a diamond, hoping to get declarer to lead a heart toward his hand.|

|sk||

at|mitche: Bidding: South has a hand this strong on alternate Blue Moon Thursdays.
In SA, and without any other conventions, 2@C followed by 3NT shows about 25 to 27 points, and that is just what South has.

North can count 33 to 35 points, and must not pass.   She wants to look for slam.
The easiest way to bid slam is for her just to bid 6NT.  Since 2@C followed by 3NT is such a bulky sequence, some pairs 
have gadgets to save room (one is called a kokish relay). 
|
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: The next gadget is the 5NT "pick a slam" that Marty Bergen loves.
Over 3NT, North might bid 5NT, and South should then bid the cheapest suit she thinks would be OK with being trumps 
(here, 6@h)
And North would bid 6@s, to say. I can tolerate spades. South would probably pass 6@s, and that would be that.
Getting to 7NT is a bad idea, but 7@C or 7@s are both reasonable. And in standard methods, just about unbiddable.
(Swap the @CQ for the @DQ and you see why 7 would be impossible to reach.) |

at|mitche:  Bidding:  West's 1NT is at the absolute top of any reasonable range for 1NT, and East is at the absolute top of 
the range for passing, so E/W wind up in a very cosy contract.  South decided this was a good time to balance, 
and her decision was kind of unlucky.  North could have had a major, and North might have had another high card or 2. 

So since neither East nor West had enough trumps to double 2@c (you need trump tricks to double a low-level contract), 
N/S stole a contact, to go down  2.  West might have made a "do something smart" double of 2@c, which should have gotten 
E/W to 2NT.  And 2NT will just make on a club lead (E/W get the hearts going.)

at|mitche:  Play:  If N/S can work out a diamond lead, they would likely beat 2NT.
No one did anything terribly wrong, but the results are poor for N/S.

MM:  By clicking on the cards, you can play the hand Double Dummy.  To continue with the next deal click the  ^$40

at|mitche: Bidding: After East bids 2@s, I think West should just bid 4@s.   Even with the 4333 shape, 
she has found a 4-4 fit, with at least 25 HCP in partnership, plus her nice texture (all those 10's, 9's, and 8's)
As Marty sez, "she who knows, goes."
jonnyquest:  Do you always suggest a Stayman bid response even with a hand that has no shortness?|
pg| ***** 105 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: Well, that is a matter of partnership agreement. 
In one of my partnerships, I play that 1NT denies a 4 or 5 card Major 
and in another partnership,  I could have a 5 card Major when I open 1NT..
Marty (and also the Granovetters) believes in opening 1NT any time you have a hand with the right number of points 
and at most 1 doubleton.  And I have also known people who open 1NT with 4441 shape and singleton A or K ...
So there you have to use Stayman.|

at|mitche: Play: It turns out that the club opening lead doesn’t give anything away.  
Declarer won and immediately cleared the @CA and took a discard (of a heart) on the @CK.  
I think declarer should wait until she knows which card would be best for a discard before going for the pitch.  
Better might be a small spade to the @SA and then @CA, and spade to the Queen.
Why? |

Playing the @SA first will allow her to discover if North has @SJxxx, and still be able to pick up the suit.|
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  By the way, if North does have @SJ9xx, she should play the @S9 when declarer plays small spade from dummy 
(this is one of a class of well-known "obligatory falsecards").
Anyway.. declarer found a 3-2 spade split.  Then she took a losing finesse in diamonds.
When North came in with the @DQ, she should not play the @DA. She should get out with a small heart.
If she has been counting declarer's points, she knows that South must hold either the @HA or @HK 
(declarer has @SAK, @CA, and with the @HAK, that would be 18 points, too much for 1NT opener).|
pg| ***** 124 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So by leading a heart before declarer gets the diamond suit going, she gives the defense a chance to defeat 4@s
Declarer should still get things right (she will need to finesse against the @HJ).

Thanks to Eileen for her generous assistance and helping me tell North from South, and to all of you for your courteous 
attention.

MM: You can play the hand Double Dummy.  This concludes this presentation, hope you enjoyed, Karen10 & GG_Bridge
