pg| ***** 25 ***** |


mb|1H|at|M_DornWiss: 1@H is the best overcall imo - an overcall can be from 7-17ish|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt||mb|d|at|M_DornWiss: many players promise 5+ @S to bid the suit rather than negative X, 
but any approach is fine

North "could" bid 1NT since has a @H stop and a flat hand - but could then "lose" the @S fit  - 
also the @D stop is non-existent - showing @S is best|

pg| ***** 28 ***** |


mb|1S|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


mb|ppp|at|M_DornWiss: north has no extras, and should pass
However, after the good 1@h overcall, west should have X'd after 1@S to tell pard of her great values and invite further competition
East does not know if west has 7 or 17 - the ensuing X says "I am at the top range for my overcall"|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt||at|Lizabc: but I have nothing to bid back to her, I cant bid over the dbl?!
M_DornWiss:  yes, liza - you should bid something as your hand is not good enough to "sit" for the X
Lizabc: what ever happened to having points?
M_DornWiss:  liza, in effect your pard's X after 1@s would say she had the points - it is for takeout saying she has a very good hand and doesn't wish to sell out
With 3 @H's going back to that suit is best then: support with support:)|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt||at|
Lizabc: If having points is old fashion,then I old fashion!
M_DornWiss:  remeber this is a partnership game
It is not just "your" values that make the hand - it is yours AND your partners
A bridge partnership is like a marriage:)|

mb|ppp|at|M_DornWiss:  There's rather a lot to this hand: It is not easy to bid - 
learning4:  diplomatic, Mike :)
M_DornWiss:  first - I like north's original pass rather than a weak 2@D that many players succumb to
With a side major suit and TWO outside 1st round controls (an ace & a void) that is not a weak 2
Some agressive bidders would open it 1@D but I am not quite of the ilk unless in 3rd seat
I feel it is best first passed and to bid later
Having said that:|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


nt||at|M_DornWiss:  The 1@C opener and 1@H overcall are fine, 
but I am not enamoured with the 1NT response - 
1) the @S suit can be lost  
2) the @C stop is alone (add the J in hand and it is better) 
further - it is usually not a good idea to bid NT with a void in partner's suit as then there is no transportation within that suit|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt||at|M_DornWiss:  Yet the hand is not really good enough - especially with a misfit - to bid 2@D
imo 1@S is the least of evils - on this hand it will strike gold|

mb|ppp|at|M_DornWiss:  Another interesting hand to bid - 1st - I reiterate: SUPPORT WITH SUPPORT (I cannot stress that enough)  
(I asked Fred if there would be a way to italisize or type in bold rather than CAPS to emphasize but he said nope)
drat...2@D and 2@H are BOTH GOOD BIDS - BUT should have been made in the first place|
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


nt||at|M_DornWiss:  the west hand had an ace, 3 card @H support, and a ruff value - aces are UNDERvalued - 
actually I count them as 4 1/2
2 wee ones: yes  I should have supported 1st round 
M_DornWiss:  my view on responding to partner's overcalls is like this:|
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


nt||at|M_DornWiss:  An overcall is roughly 7-17 and the MIDpoint therefore = 12
So I assume partner has the midpoint - a minimum opening bid value - and respond just like I would to an opener
If partner has less (s)he won't bid again
If more, will|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


nt||at|M_DornWiss:  This is a hand that should be bid to a 5@D game
I like north reopening X
and had south originally bid 2@D north would be off to the races
However I still find 3@D a bid of an underbid and would instead trot out 2@S
If south then rebid @D's I might still peep out 4@D as a last ditch effort|
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


nt||at|M_DornWiss:  south Q 2@H?
BabsG:  yes - to show support  and a limit raise?
M_DornWiss:  I don't think so - after the original pass it's impossible to "catch up"
wik54:  I wanted to undo my reopening x thinking partner would have doubled 1@H if had 4@S and points
M_DornWiss:  I think the reopening X was fine - if pard rebid @C you can go back to @D but pard might have held a weak hand with 5 @S's and have been unable to X or bid them
X would find the fit on the original pass auction and 2@S instead of 3@D would do so on the actual one|

mb|ppp|at|Karen10: :) took your 4@d as a splinter
M_DornWiss:  ok - the wheels came off and the train took to water, but a heckuva lucky result with @S's 3=3!
When these results happen against me I just smile and scrape the egg off my face:)|
pg| ***** 131 ***** |


nt||at|M_DornWiss:  first - there was no need to bid 4@D, as 3@D is forcing (to game) - 
it was sharp of west to take it as a splinter, as that is a common approach to a jump to a minor on these auctions.|
pg| ***** 132 ***** |


at|
Also - a NT opener cannot bid BW         4NT is to play
Karen10: after "splinter"...suit agreed, showing slam interest.....so would be BLW?
M_DornWiss:  again - even IF 4@D were a splinter and @H's were agreed - the NT opener cannot and should not bid BW - 
NT is to play
West could cuebid if wished - such as 4@S, but a control ask is responder's duty|
pg| ***** 133 ***** |


nt||at|M_DornWiss:  There is a modern treatment for east to ask for controls - it is called "kickback" - 
where the suit above trumps asks for controls - here after 2@H   "4@S"  would be a control ask
But I really do not wish to confuse the issue at this level of play|
pg| ***** 134 ***** |


nt||at|mopel: So how do I tell p I have an opening?
M_DornWiss:  After a 3@D rebid by east, west should rebid 3NT - 

Then a 4NT raise by east would be quantitative, asking west to bid slam with 17 or with 16 and a good 5 suit 
Playing with a regular pard we would not reach slam - it is dependent on too much|

mb|ppp|at|M_DornWiss:  wow - lotsa over & unders on this one! 
West was the only perfect bidder :)|
pg| ***** 156 ***** |


nt||at|M_DornWiss:  1 puppy track (@C) should be passed out, 
(although some would overcall 1@H with the good 4 card suit - it's not terrible to do so imo.) 
The balancing X by north is way too aggressive - 
The values are weak, it is a "Disney" hand (full of quacks - queens/jacks) and should be devalued - 
also the shape is flat and poor for take out|
pg| ***** 157 ***** |


nt||at|M_DornWiss:  Having heard the X, however, opener east should XX
That shows a better than minimum range hand - 
(after all, had west responded it was a 2NT rebid for opener)

After the balancing X by north and pass by east south is a bit too good for just 1@H
Therefore 2@H is a bit better - you don't want to "hang" balancer when they are on a minimum|

nt||at|Karen10: 1NT by east after X ok?
M_DornWiss:  East might also choose 1NT as a rebid instead of XX - 
That also shows better than a minimum hand

Ideally the auction should go 1@C...float!  (although as I said, a 1@H overcall is fine, even on a 4 carder as it is a good one)|
