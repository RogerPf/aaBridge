^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||at|


^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

mitche: Hi, everyone and welcome to tonight's 2 over 1 bid, play and discuss session.
2 over 1 means: 
If your partner opens in first or second seat and you bid a non-jump 2 level bid, it is game-forcing.
Also if pard opens 1@H or 1@s in first/second seat, your response of 1NT (with no intervening bid) 
is forcing for 1 round .  Otherwise, the bidding looks a lot like SA|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||at|92612:  Mitch, do you use reverse Bergen with 2/1? 
And do you use Drury?
mitche: I prefer regular Bergen, not reverse. 
Because you need the game invite more over the weaker response
Yes, 2-way reverse, but any Drury agreement is useful 
|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||at|dragonfy:  I doubled on the Rule of 9 tonight - what a disaster
mitche: The rule of 9 was in the May bulletin. It works if you remember when not to use it
If you have a broken trump holding IN FRONT of the bidder, beware!!
dragonfy:  I need to find out when NOT to use it LOL|

sk||pc|cq|at|mitche: Marty Bergen says that raising partner is the best bid in bridge
So... let's see - west had a chance to support hearts early. 
Even with the 6 card diamond suit, a heart raise makes sense to me
You know that you have at least an 8 card fit and a singleton in the suit the opponents bid
So forget about the @D suit for now and bid 2@H|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||at|BILAsst10: Wasn’t sure she had 5 - but maybe she doesn’t overcall a 4-card suit
I will overcall a good 4-card major at the 1 level   (but yes I should have)
mitche: So you will learn to play 4-3 fits :)
Also, if pard overcalls in second seat on a 4 card major, you can count on a singleton somewchere..... 
The late Marshall Miles wrote a book, Bridge in the 21st century, that discusses 4 card overalls in depth
IF you play them, some people use a jump in the unbid suit as a "picture bid" showing a good 5 card suit and support for overcaller. BUT THAT IS AN EXPERT TREATMENT requiring a lot  of discussion|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Before we leave the discussion - what are your understandings about "free bids" in third seat?
Some people play that 1@S, as S bid here, is just the same as if there was no overcall
dragonfy:  I debated about going 2@S but wasn't sure if you would take that as a 6-card weak bid
dianavd:  with no overcall I'd take for 4 spades, but she'd negative double with a 4-card after overcall 
mitche: Just make sure you know whether the free bid shows values or can be made on a light hand with a long suit
dragonfy:  So would 2@S have been better here?|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: I was going to recommend a 2@S bid, 
BUT with 3 cards in the overcalled suit, the jump to 2@S would be risky
Better to have something other than 6322 shape, especially with 3 in the overcaller's suit
So if you use light free bids, bid 1@S - otherwise, pass and come in later|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt||at|Back to the bidding: 
After 2@S, E has a better call than 3@H 
Pard bid @D which should say (or shout) "I don’t have heart support" - so 3@D would be fine here
BILAsst10: and I planned to raise @H's next time
mitche: If E bid 3@D, W can comfortably raise hearts. 
3@H here by east should say "6 hearts"
Just be careful about rebidding 5 card suit at 3 level when partner's bidding says the hand may not fit|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: One last point ... 
I would have given some thought about 4@S by S... 
S has a probable 10 card fit and no defense against 4@H, so 4@S should be a decent save.
In fact, you lose 2 diamonds, 1 club, 2 hearts, which is not bad against 4@H
dianavd:  and I was too minimum to go 4 I thought
mitche: N bid her hand with 2@S

sk||pc|ca|at|mitche: Bidding: West has a hand that some would open 2NT on 
(yes, it's 5422, but it also looks very notrumpy)
Which if she had, E/W would have gotten (or should have gotten) to 4@H which is always making
But 1@S is reasonable. 
BILAsst10: yes I see all those @H's
gypsy1308: yes then I bid 4@H (well transfer to @H)|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: East decided to pass, pretty sensibly
And S decided to reopen with 2@D, also reasonable
West's pass is pretty well..... passive (sorry 'bout that)
She might try to bid 3@C, asking her pard to pick a black suit
BILAsst10: That would be a disaster, when she couldn’t respond over 1@S I didn’t see much sense in going on|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: Eileen, you aren't going to get rich selling out to 3@D with half the deck and shortness in diamonds!
If your pard has 4 small clubs and a doubleton spade, you are going to make 3 clubs, just on brute force!
I understand your reluctance to take a negative score - but the point here is - your hand is worth a lot if pard has any 6 black cards... 
BILAsst10: but not if she doesnt, I would have to bid 3@C  and my @S suit is pretty lousy
mitche: OK - if you want to pass, then you wind up with a small plus. And miss game in the process :(|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt||at|BILAsst10: I see no way going to make game so maybe can set ops if they get too high and they are vul
mitche: It is true that best defense beats 3@D 2 tricks, which if you double, is +500 ... but +100 is a small profit with these cards
I will never miss 5-3 spade fit playing "puppet stayman" - so 2NT looks right to me
I am shedding popcorn here.. Sue brought a bag in and I am covering the couch with it ...
East will bid 3@H with her 7 card suit, and you will either pass or bid 4..

up|42|pf|y|at|On to the play: When W played the @CAK (well- judged to continue clubs, Eileen), 
East should discard a spade, not the small heart because you can then get 2 ruffs! 
Eileen gives you a club ruff at trick 3, and then a spade to the ace and a second spade, which you  ruff
You do not know that W has the @SA, but it doesn't hurt at all to try this (if S has the @SA, the East hand is now 100% worthless).|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |

gypsy1308: could I have bid 3@H?
mitche: Yes, Eleanor, you could have, but given West's pass over 2@D, you should have a better suit, something like Q10xxxxx

pc|d9|at|mitche: Bidding: I think that it's incumbent on E/W to look for a spade fit sooner or later. 
E/W will make 4@H if they can bid it, so E/W need to know how to find their heart fit, too
I think that if N bids 2@C, East needs to make a negative double.
If W bids spades, E can then raise diamonds, but you want to find a major suit fit if you have one
So the auction might be: 
pass  1@D   2@C   X    
4@C    4@H
And then N can decide whether to defend or declare.|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: A lot of people would wonder about a negative X with 3-5 shape
But East cannot bid 2@H here (not enough points), and she can always raise diamonds later, if necessary
The problem with a 4-3 spade fit, if it exists, is that the spade honors are in the 3-card suit, and if the defense plays clubs, you are ruffing with high trumps.. not the best,  unless W has a solid @S suit... 
Anyway, we did not have that problem
3NT was imaginative, and all it needs is for S to have a king outside of clubs|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: But as mentioned earlier, I would have bid @C with the S hand, because 
a) I have a LOT of clubs and 
b) I don't have any defense 
Anyway, N made a bid he hoped to make, and life was tough tonight. 
Should she bid 3NT?
Probably. It doesn't need a lot to make ...

up|40|pf|y|at|mitche: Now, on to the play
Look at trick 1
East led the @CK. Declarer has the @CAJ and dummy has the club 10
Declarer should win the @CAce and play the club jack at trick 2
This allows her to make 2 clubs instead of 1.|
pg| ***** 111 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: More important, it gives the defense a problem, 
because the @C10 threatens to be a dummy entry if the defense ever leads clubs, 
and also a discard for a potential red suit loser|
pg| ***** 112 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: By the way, when N plays the clubs that way, she discovers that East started with the @CKQ and then with the @SK...
That leaves just 13 points the defense can hold. And since W opened the bidding, 
she must have  both red aces and queens, else her opening bid was substandard for first seat
The key point here - watch the card combinations (@CAJ) and count points to learn where high cards are placed

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Also, S has one legitimate shot at making 3NT.
It is to bang down the @DAce and hope that the 3 outstanding diamonds are divided 2-1 with the King singleton
If it is, you take 10 tricks. If not, well, too bad

please click the  ^$40 for the next board |

sk||pc|d5|at|mitche: Bidding: I think that S has a 1@C opening bid, rather than passing.. 
with 14 HCP, you want to get the first blow in on the auction
After that, any action S takes is going to be a problem. 
You cannot recover after passing a full opener in second seat|

nt||at|mitche: Now, what should 1NT mean here? 
When you, as a passed hand bid 1NT when the opponents have bid 2 suits, 
you are making a 2-suited takeout bid. 
This is the "sandwich" notrump: since 1NT is impossible after passing 
(you cannot possibly want to play 1NT with both opponents bidding) 
the bid shows a hand like 5-2-1-5 and weakness... |
pg| ***** 151 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Sort of like a michaels cue bid or unusual notrump bid.. 
If you double 1@H, you show almost an opening hand with support for the unbid suits, 
something like 11 points and 4-3-2-4 shape
If N recognized the bid as sandwich, she could bid 3@S directly over 2@D to put maximum pressure on E/W...

up|45|pf|y|at|On to the play: One suggestion for declarer.. 
ruff the last diamond before you play hearts... and then...don't play hearts. 
Go after clubs!
Reason: 
If you play clubs, you develop a parking place for your heart loser
And by ruffing the @D before playing clubs, you'll endplay west if she has the @CA, too|
