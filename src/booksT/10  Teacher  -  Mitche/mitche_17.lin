^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
He’s been mentoring in BIL for 2 years and lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

He learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |

^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

mitche: Hi, everyone and welcome to tonight's 2 over 1 play and discuss session.
2 over 1 means: 
If your partner opens in first or second seat and you bid a non-jump 2 level bid, it is game-forcing.
Also if pard opens 1@H or 1@s in first/second seat, your response of 1NT (with no intervening bid) 
is forcing for 1 round .  Otherwise, the bidding looks a lot like SA|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||at|92612:  Mitch, do you use reverse Bergen with 2/1? 
And do you use drury?
mitche: I prefer regular Bergen, not reverse. 
Because you need the game invite more over the weaker response
Yes, 2-way reverse, but any Drury agreement is useful

sk|n|lb|*cWhat would be your Opening lead?^^h7^SQ87H9732DA92CT86|
pc|h2|sk||at|mitche: Bidding: The East hand evaluates to a Bergen 20 (barely), but not to an Edelman 22 :)
That is, total of your HCP, 2 longest suits, and quick tricks...If that is 22 or more, open in first or 2nd seat
The E hand is 21 1/2, and is at best a marginal opening... 
If you do open these kinds of hands, I think you should have a 5 card major (at IMPS)
At matchpoints, for those interested, you should open this hand|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: OK - the 1NT response looks correct, and East has nowhere to go.
Lola8888:  I had 13 pts - Should I have done a dbl?  but - I had 3@D's
mitche: South's hand is 4333 with 13 points. Best is for her to go quietly, since her hand is not likely to be a useful dummy, unless N has a long suit...
So I like passing. But should S pass after 1NT?|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: I would be more inclined to double 1NT, which you should treat as takeout
OK - why I recommend the double over 1NT
Note that the bidding says the HCP are very evenly divided. 
So N rates not to be broke.
Also, the hand has support for the majors. And West, for sure doesn't have a 4 card major, 
meaning N is almost 100% sure to|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||at| mitche: N/S will settle in 2@H which will probably go down just 1, which is a better result than allowing E/W to make 1NT

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: OK - on to play
At trick 1, S knows that it must be right to shift. What did she shift to?|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


at|
It was the @D8.  You may have heard the guideline, "lead through strength to weakness"
So Dummy's weakest suit is? Spades! 
So at trick 2, S should shift to her 4th best spade. 
This immediately sets up 2 spades (the Q will score immediately or soon, and then N/S will win 3 spades.|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: What is also important is that dummy has strength in diamonds, and this means that S should not help set up what rates to be declarer's suit.
Finally - when declarer was in dummy at trick 9 (the @DQ won), the 13th diamond was a winner. It may have been useful to cash it
So summary: on defense, it's usually better to try to set up your side's suit than declarer's.

pc|Da|sk||at|mitche: Bidding: After 2@S, it's not clear what is best with the N hand.
But whatever is best, I am sure it is not to double. 
Here is why: the double in Standard bidding is not takeout, but card-showing, inviting partner to convert to penalty with the right kind of hand (a couple of trump tricks)
N doesn't have that.|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Some people play the X here to show support for partner's overcalled suit (a "romex" double)
This hand doesn't have that, either
So the double seems not a good choice.
I think if I bid at all - and I don't know for sure that I would - I would just bid 3@H.  
But at this vulnerability, it is very, very risky|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: The @SK looks useless, and there's no guarantee of finding pard with a heart fit, 
I would pass and bid 3@H after a reopening double
You remember our prior discussions on balancing, I hope|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Oh, before I leave the bidding!
After West's 3@S bid and North's raise, should East bid 4@S?|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


at|
Well, here's the problem: N's double overstated her strength by about an ace or so, 
If N/S can make 4@H (they actually can), then 4@S rates to be a fair sacrifice.
So I would bid 4@S, as insurance. 
Also, East's hand has improved.. the singleton heart is valuable on offense, not on defense

pc|h6|at|mitche: Bidding: the S hand is not quite strong enough for 2@H.  
As a passed hand, she needs at least 10 points for that bid, and with so many points in quacks, better to bid 1NT
If S bids 1NT, then N should rebid 3@D
As it is, after S bid 3NT, N should bid 4@D. 
Why?|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


nt||at|jan heaton:  shows 2 suited hand, uneven distribution
mitche: There is no guarantee that S has just the right stuff to make 3NT @DQ and @HA)
So playing in @S or @D is safer -  In fact, 4@S is 100%
Lola8888:  I thought about saying 1NT but thought- if I counted a pt for 5th card - that made 10 pts. 
mitche: I understand, but the absence of texture and the preponderance of quacks devalue the hand.
In Bergen evaluation, the hand is worth 9 
You cannot count both the @SJ and @DQ as 3 points and extra points for distribution

sk||at|mitche: Bidding: When you double an artificial bid (as 2@H was), 
you are saying, "please lead this suit, pard, when you get in, or on opening lead
You are also saying, If you have heart length, we may have a save against their spade contract
In other words, you should have a 5th heart, I think|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Even with 15 points, the S hand should just go quietly. 
mitche: Next - West bid 2@S
When you accept the transfer bid after a double, you promise 3 cards in the suit (or more)
The reason this is important - East, if she held a better hand, would know that there is an 8 card spade fit, and she can bid spades to the appropriate level|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


nt||at|Liz111:  If W doesn’t have 3 cards, what does W bid then? NT?
mitche: W would pass.
East can redouble to say, "please complete the transfer"|
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


nt||at|Also, suppose that W had really good hearts, say KQ10x

If you lead clubs, as you did, you run a chance that one of the defenders might be able to ruff a club 
If it's from the hand with 3 trumps, that isn't terrible, but if the hand with 2 spades can ruff, you go down in a cold contract

a) the East hand could be as good as 17 points
b) West has 4 card support and a void. And an outside AK
So W should bid 3@C
gypsy1308: Void in pard's first bid suit :(|
pg| ***** 120 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: East would probably bid 3@H and W would bid 4@C, which might get EW to 5@C. Which has its chances (!)
I think the only defense against 5@C is for the defense to play some trumps.|
pg| ***** 121 ***** |


nt||at|7047:  should I have re-bid my 6  Hearts first before the club bid? 
mitche: Good question ...
Here is the guideline: let's say you have 6 cards in suit A and 4 in suit B. 
The sequence A, A, B shows 6-4, 
So does the sequence A-B-A
The difference: the first sequence is limited to about a bad 15 points. With better, you bid A,B,A|
pg| ***** 122 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So your hand is much too good to bid 2@H
If W bids 3@C, E should bid 3@H - West might have @D cards and try 3NT. 
If W does bid 3NT, E should pass, since she has shown her strength (16+) and 10 of her cards - actually, 11 of ... them|
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: West would also bid 4@H on a hand like KQxx, xx, xxxx, Qxx
On THIS hand, W does NOT have a @D card so she will not bid 3NT, but rather, she will bid 4@C

And declarer should discard spades from dummy - there is less chance that someone will overruff diamonds|
pg| ***** 138 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Summary of key points: We already went over ABA. Remember it, it's important
Next, declarer should see long trumps in both hands, and also shortness in the side suits. That spells "cross-ruff" and she should think how to play the hand that way

pc|cq|sk||at|mitche: Bidding: When your pard has preempted with 3@H or 3@S 
and you have 4 card support, just bid 4 – period!

Unless you have a really good hand for 3NT
Like West's one.|
pg| ***** 146 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: If your pard is reliable about having a good suit when he preempts vulnerable, you may risk 3NT
Notice that any lead from N surrenders the 9th trick here|
pg| ***** 147 ***** |


nt||at|Dui_bu_chi:  Reliable = ?  Does vulnerability alter how to preempt
mitche: Yes. Vulnerable, you should have 1 more playing trick than N/V
The "rule of 2 and 3" says,  a vul preempt should expect to be no worse than down 2 opposite an average dummy
And a nonvul preempt should be good enough to be down 3 with an average dummy
If E doesn't have this good a @H suit, he should have an outside honor, and any honor in E hand will help|
pg| ***** 148 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Now, let's say that W did bid 3NT. 
North should bid 4@D
The more conservative E/W bidding is, the more that N wants to bid 4@D
I do not think we have enough time to discuss what a double of 4@H by N should mean and how to respond to it.. but I think there is a good case for treating a double of 4@H here ... as takeout

up|44|pf|y|at|mitche: But now on to play:
East's hand is pretty easy to count out. 
She followed to 3 rounds of spades and ruffed the second club + she has 7 trumps 
(S followed to 2 rounds)
That leaves exactly 2 unknown cards, and they both are diamonds|
pg| ***** 162 ***** |


nt||at|kyno40: My mistake with @D
So when N wins the @DJ at trick 11, he knows that a spade will yield a ruff and sluff. 
This means he should cash the @DA

mitche: Before we launch into a discussion, I want to make an announcement: 
Next Tuesday (26/3) is the second night of Passover, and I will not be here. That means I will not have a chance to wish you all a happy Easter or Passover after tonight. 
So, happy ... Easter, Passover, SpringTime, or any other celebration you may be observing.

Now, I would like to open the table for a discussion - I have a hand in mind:
Here is a hand I held a couple of nights ago, which I think is interesting

@sxx  @hAx  @dQJxxxxx   @cKx

You are playing IMPS (essentially rubber bridge) and you are in ^*ufirst seat^*N.|fp|1|at| 
What do you do with this hand, and more importantly, why?


|cp|4|at|arya_01:  1@D to try and reach 3NT if partner shows major 
jdbowman: I'll bite - 2@D
gypsy1308: I would open 2@D weak 
7047:  I'm confident 1@D
arya_01:  ditto
Calligal: I don't think it is a weak 2 hand, 13 pts including length in @D|cp|2|at|

mitche: So the choices are 1@D or 2@D ... Anyone for 3@D or pass?

|cp|4|at|gypsy1308: Doesn't meet rule 20
Calligal: some may say pass to wait to see what partner says about their hand
gypsy1308: v or n/v?  makes a difference|cp|2|at|
mitche: If you think vulnerability matters, you are probably contemplating a preempt of some sort - so non-vul
|cp|4|at|7047:  got a re-bid of 2@D
EddyHaskel: I'm passing, there are a lot of points out there in the other hands.  
Then I'm bidding 2@D over pard's major.
eleno59: I'll take 3@D|
pg| ***** 165 ***** |


nt||fp|1|cp|2|at|^b@2 

@sxx  @hAx  @dQJxxxxx   @cKx 
mitche: Here are the choices:  a) pass;   b) 1@D   c) 2@d   d) 3@d   e) anything else|
pg| ***** 166 ***** |

mitche: OK – 3@D is a bad idea. 
Why?

|cp|4|at|Liz111:  with 7 playing tricks, too strong for pre-empt
gypsy1308: can't find what p has
EddyHaskel: my good cards in other suits say don't open 3@D... if I'm opening it's one level.
EddyHaskel: this hand might set a lot of opponents' games|cp|2|at|

mitche: The strength isn't the issue. There are 2 other points, tho
The first and most important is you have 2 very good defensive cards, the @HA and @CK
When you preempt, you are saying that your hand is offensive in nature and of little value in any contract other than the suit you bid
The second reason - 7222 is the worst possible distribution for a 3-level preempt. 
So 3@D is definitely out of the running. 

mitche: OK - now, let's consider 2@D|cp|4|at|
EddyHaskel: I don't open 2 level for almost all the same reasons I don't open 3
EddyHaskel: altho if pard uses Ogust, I have a nice rebid|cp|2|at|
True about Ogust, but the stronger your opponents, the less that 2@D will slow them down

mitche: With a 7-card suit and the outside cards, 2@D is probably not a very good idea either, because 
a) it has not much preemptive value and 
b) we still have defense and 
c) pard will ... never be able to work out that you have a 7th diamond, 
meaning your 2@D bid may help partner misdefend

pg| ***** 167 ***** |


nt||fp|1|cp|2|at|^b@2 

We are down to      pass or 1@D
First - I think we need to imagine one thing: 
Let's suppose you have this hand @sAQ10xx, @hKxx, @dx, @cxxxx
Would you open 1@S in second seat?|
pg| ***** 168 ***** |


at|
Of course not.
But would you overcall 1@D with 1@S?|
pg| ***** 169 ***** |


at|
Of course you would!

What I am getting at is this-- 
Second hand will have a much easier time getting into the auction over 1@D than if you pass
If you open 1@D with this hand, you actually make it easier for the opponents to get into the bidding at a low level and to push you around 
And your partner will expect how many quick tricks?|
pg| ***** 170 ***** |


at|
Your pard will expect you to have 2 of them!!
You have 1 ½ quick tricks. 
So partner will often find himself wanting to double the opponents when they get to 3@S  
and he has 2 trump tricks and an outside picture.

My recommendation is, with a marginal hand and no majors, pass and await developments, especially at IMPS
At matchpoints, I would be more inclined to open, if only to get the first bid in, and only nonvul
