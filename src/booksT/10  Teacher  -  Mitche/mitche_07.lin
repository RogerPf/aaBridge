^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
He’s been mentoring in BIL for 2 years and lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

He learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||at|


^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play.

You are all bidding 2 over 1 with these conventions: fourth suit forcing and new minor forcing,
OK, folks, let's start! Happy bidding, playing, and discussing! ...|

mitche: bidding: The auction was just what I think it should have been...
South's 2@c established a game-forcing auction, so there was no need for South to jump to 3NT. 
Had N had 6 Hearts, the 2NT bid gives North a chance to rebid 3@h, which would have steered NS to 4@h
when that contract is right. Well Bid!

up|52|pf|y|at| mitche: Play: 
The auction tells West that her partner is broke, with at most 5 points or so. (the opps get to 3N and you have 9 HCP... that leaves not much for your pard...)
So what should West lead?|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: I think the safest lead would be the @sJ, because it is safe (Neither N nor S has 4 Spades...)
and b) if pard's 4 or 5 points include the @sQ or (maybe you are really lucky) the @sKQ
you will maybe take 4 Spades and the @hA
There is little hope of taking more than 2 Heart tricks,,,|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: One point on declarer play -- when you lose the @d finesse and a Spade comes back- win in dummy and run the @d-suit. You may get some useful discards (a Club or 2?), in which case you may be able to set up an extra trick, either in Clubs or Hearts
Save the Spade entry for later...|

mitche: bidding:
I think that when you overcall a 1NT bid, you should have a decent suit. So I would not have bid 2@s on South's hand
The hand's 12 HCP aren't working very well.. if the @cK were the @sQJ, I would have no problem with a 2-suited overcall that showed the majors
(moviemaker: For ex. 2@h showing hearts and spades, or Multi Landy 2@c showing 5-4 or 4-5 in the majors)|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: What should West do after 2@s?
If you're playing convention-free bids in this situation, then 3@c is probably non-forcing, 
West has a tough time showing a good hand with Clubs after the overcall..
mitche: So if you use natural bids, 3@c should be lots of Clubs, not much more
bjmue: I was going to use the Spade transfer to Clubs but South interferred!|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: There is a convention (and a very good one, too), called "lebensohl" 
That allows you to cover pretty nearly every problem you run into when someone interferes with 1NT.
When N bid 3@s, East might give some thought to doubling, because down 1 is 200, a better score than 4@c
In fact, 3@s goes down 1 or 2, depending on the opening lead...|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: so - summary on bidding: 2@s should show a better suit, and 3@c should be long Clubs and not much more
amcs: how should bidding go?
mitche: I think the bidding should be 
1N p 2@s p
3@c|

nt||up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: after the 2@s overcall, the @sA seems right. And then Bonnie made a good guess leading the @cA 
If NS are non-vul against vul opponents, S might consider whatever her system is to show a major 2-suiter
But what I want you to look up is the "lebensohl" convention.. It is worth learning, even for intermediates.
In my opinion (for what it's worth), lebensohl is one of my favorite conventions, along with Jacoby transfers, negative doubles, and roman key card blackwood|

at|mitche: bidding: When S bid 2NT, Jacoby, North's responses are as follows: 
a) a bid of a new suit at the 3 level shows a singleton, or possibly a void.
b) a new suit at the 4 level shows a minimum 5-5 hand with concentrated strength in the 2 suits
c) a jump to 4 of your major shows a minimum hand with no shortness
d) a bid of 3 of your major shows a good hand, 
and e) a bid of 3N shows a really good hand
d) and e) are slam try bids... 
 |
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Based on that, what should N have bid over 2NT?
kat827:  4@S?
mitche: yes, indeed. 4@S, which would slow down S, who had every reason to think there might have been a slam, if 3@C really was a singleton...|

up|27|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: N has to guess whether to finesse twice in spades or to bang down the @sA
There is a small percentage edge in finessing twice, but this hand is one where playing the ace is better.
Here is why - if you pick up a singleton honor, you are home. If you get just small cards you may decide to run the diamonds, hoping to catch the person with long trumps has to follow to 4 rounds, in which case you can get rid of all of your clubs...
And you still have the option of playing a second round of trumps... :)

(mm: I think that should be 5 rounds to void the club suit...)|

mitche: this is not a simple hand at the 5 level, but you should not be at the 5 level...

mitche: bidding: I think that it's pretty standard for about everyone to play 4th suit forcing
So West's 2@d is an artificial, game-forcing bid!
realrowdy:  yikes
mitche: yep... it aint that invitational 5-5.. 
realrowdy:  how should I bid?
|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Over 1@S, I think that 2@d is fine, because it asks East to bid 2@h with 3 card support
But after 2NT, West should bid 3@d, which says "5-4 or 5-5" in the red suits
East will bid 3@h, and you might use your judgment to pass . 
3@h (or even 4) is not  a bad place to play the contract.. 
Basically - 4th suit forcing shows about an opening hand, and W is really close.|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Alternatively, West might bid 2@C instead of 2@D, which has the disadvantage of being a horrible underbid... or 2@H, which is also a distortion of her hand..|

The key is that when you play the @D10 at trick 1, East wastes the value of her @D8...
Kind of a tricky deal -- either N gets endpayed in spades or S in diamonds :)

mitche: bidding: Clearly, the 3@d contract means there were  some serious partnership misunderstandings
North's double is a take-out double for the 2 unbid suits, clubs and diamonds, in this case
shoeman:  that's how I saw it
mitche: North has a lot of points, but both of her suits were bid. Her best action is just to pass and wait developments OK?|
pg| ***** 120 ***** |


nt||at|Next  - after East's 2@c bid, S has been relieved of the obligation to bid. So with a bad hand only 4 diamonds, the best thing to do is to pass
A "free bid" may not show points here (after all, S probably is pretty weak), but it does show a better suit OK???
shoeman:  my @D should be 5+?
mitche: Yes, you should have a better suit than Qxxx, either length or strength
At a minimum, if your suit is just 4 cards in length, a free 2@D bid should show a good 7 dummy points or so, if you have a 5 card suit, you might bid on 6 points|
pg| ***** 121 ***** |


nt||at|
Third: after the offshape X, N has no reason to raise on a doubleton... 
And finally, when the auction got to 3@D, West should double. Pard opened the bidding and you have the majority of points, and 2 or 3 trump tricks!
OK- key points.. at the 1 level, when your pard has either not bid, or has passed. a double shows the 2 or 3 unbid suits.. Usually... 
It is never made with shortness in the unbid suits|

sk||at|mitche: bidding: the double of 1@d is kind of thin, I think. If you are doubling on 4333 distribution, I think you should do it with no wastage in the suit you are doubling (in this case, ... the @dQ)
When you have strength in your opponents' suit, you should be more willing to defend.
At any rate, East doubled. West has a pretty good hand in this auction, and with two aces and 9 points, I would bid 2@c over the double. Even with the horrible  4333 shape...|
pg| ***** 132 ***** |


nt||at|I don't particularly mind 1NT by north; some people would bid 1@S, but after the double, there's less incentive to bid the spade suit
And passing 2@H is automatic...S said he has long hearts and not much else...
BTW, I would think about a jump-shift to 2@h over the double! (showing 6-card and 4-6 pts)|
pg| ***** 133 ***** |


nt||at|  
mitche: So I think the bidding might be 1@D (X) 2@h all pass
2@h over the double is weak... shows no tricks outside the heart suit... Some people play that you have no defensive tricks at all, but I think that a broken 6 card suit to the ace is OK

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: We have discussed leading unsupported aces in side suits against trump contracts.
If it's wrong to lead unsupported aces, it's "wronger" to underlead them!
40 lashes across the back with a wet noodle for underleading the @CA...
Better is to lead a spade (the 6) here |

mitche: After a spade lead and trump shift, declarer is cooked. his best play is to come off dummy with a club, and then the spade King will get pickled... Declarer will wind up with just 6 tricks at most, and possibly even 5..

sk||at|mitche: bidding: S has a hand worth 12 HCP and  15 support points in diamonds, (1 for the 5th diamond, 2 for the doubleton), so the 2 over 1 bid is well-justified
Over 3@d, N might bid 3@s (showing a stopper) or 3@h (asking for one), depending on their conventions.
|
pg| ***** 159 ***** |


nt||at|irinica:  Can S bid 2@D, inverted minor?
shoeman:  I thought about that but not in P profile
mitche: Either way, they should find their way to 3NT, which is also cold as the cards sit:
5 diamonds, 3 clubs, the heart ace.. on a spade lead, 3N might make 4|

mitche: We have a bit of time left over - we can either play some, or I can bore you with a discussion of something useful - like bidding over takeout doubles
OK - doubles and responding:

When your left-hand opponent opens the bidding and your partner doubles, it shows support (at least Hxx) for any unbid major. 
And shortness in the suit that she doubled.|
pg| ***** 173 ***** |


at| 
So, let's see: LHO and partner have opening bids, leaving perhaps 14 points total for you and RHO.. 
If your RHO passes, then you have 2 choices: to bid or to pass. 

Let us see what you need to pass partner's double: 
You need to have a lot of trump tricks, AND no fit for partner's major|
pg| ***** 174 ***** |


at|

Example: LHO opened 1@h, your pard doubled, and RHO passes: 1@h  X   pass   ??
You have @sX, @hKQ1098, @dAxx, @cJxxx 
This is a MINIMUM hand for passing the double of 1 of a major... 
Notice... you do not have a major-suit fit... 
Questions?

BabsG:  Does this have anything to do with the Rule of 9?
mitche: No.. it has to do with Ron Klinger's rule of 10 and 12..  You can find it online at bridgehands.com|
pg| ***** 175 ***** |


at|

Basically the rule of 12 is: 
- the length of your trump suit plus the level of the contract must be at least 12 (rule of 12)
- And the number of trump winners in your hand + level is at least 10

So here, you have 3 sure winners (KQ109) and the opponents are contracting for 7 tricks.. (rule of 10)
You have a misfit and the balance of power: you have 5 trumps + 7 trick contract level = 12, 
3 trump tricks + 7 tricks = 10|
pg| ***** 176 ***** |

at|^b@2

Clearly, the higher the level, the fewer trumps and tricks you need to pass a takeout X
But most of the time you will want to bid over partner's TO double

So here is the general idea: bid your longest suit other than the one bid by LHO
Example: 1@h  X  pass  ??   
You have @sxxxx  @hxxx  @dJxx  @cQxx 
You MUST bid, so you bid 1@s, your longest suit|
pg| ***** 177 ***** |


at|

If I have a 4 card major and a 5 card minor, it depends on scoring method, to an extent
At anything but matchpoints, bid your longest suit (generally), but prefer your 4 card major at matchpoints
or if your major has better "texture"
Remember, your pard will probably lead your suit if the other side wins the bid.. 
Do not hang him by bidding 2@C when you have KJxx, xxx, x, Jxxxx|
pg| ***** 178 ***** |


at|
As usual, we love to bid majors and bid minors only when we have a very good reason to do so.

Sometimes, you have a better hand than the junky 1@S hand we just saw
When you have 9 points, jump 1 level. 
Example, Again, the bidding was 1@h  X  pass   ??
You have @sKJxx, @hxxx, @dxx, @cAJxx. Jump to 2@s with this hand|
pg| ***** 179 ***** |


at|

The arithmetic behind the 9 HCP thing is - when you have 9 + HCP, your side owns the hand .. 
so you announce it to pard, and you may wind up getting to game, even when LHO opened.|
pg| ***** 180 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

Ok .. We have discussed the main kinds of hands and bids you will see when your RHO passes the double.
Some times, RHO will find some kind of bid: a raise of 1@h to 2@h or maybe he bids a new suit or some number of NT
So what do you do when the auction goes 1plum  X  2plums?
There is not much of a chance for you to have enough trumps to double for penalty, so the double is "responsive"
It shows a hand with support for the unbid suits- and depending on the level you are forcing partner to bid at, your point count is as follows: 
- If pard can bid at the 2-level, your hand should have a good 6-8 or so, 
- If you are forcing pard to bid at the 3 level, you should have a very good 8 or 9|
pg| ***** 181 ***** |


at|
Example: @sQxxx, @hAxx, @dxx, @cQJxx -- 
LHO bids 1@d  X  2@d  ???
You would double again - especially if I get the hand right Qxxx, Axxx, xx, QJx 
So a responsive double shows support for any suit the doubler would like to bid... 
If the auction were 1@s  X  2@s, you would need a hand like this to double responsively: 
xx, Axxx, KJx, QJxx|
pg| ***** 182 ***** |


at|

OK, finally what does it mean if the partner of the opener bid some new suit?
Example: 1@c  X  1@S  ???
Now, your double (in Standard bidding) is not responsive. It is a penalty double! You are showing 4+ spades AND about 9 points
Here is the logic: pard has 13 points (about) and for his double of 1@C, at least 3 spades.Right?
You have 4 card "support" for spades and with 8 or 9 points, you have the balance of strength, too
So you have the majority of the spades and the majority of the points. Think the opponents are going to like being in spades?|
pg| ***** 183 ***** |

This also helps you expose the jokester who bids his short suit when he has a big fit for his partner's minor
OK, that is it for this part of the rather complicated topic of bidding after your partner doubles.. 
For a complete discussion of this, there are 3 books I like: 
a) "bridge with bells and whistles, by MaryAnn Dufresne (book of the year, 2010), 
b) Ellen Pomer's book SAYC, which is more for beginners, and finally, 
c) Eddie Kantar's beginner's bidding book.. (I forget the title -- sorry)|

moviemaker: And as a reminder:

A general guideline for responding when your partner's opening bid is doubled by RHO:

1@d   X   XX = 10+ (balanced with lack of support, forcing)
1@d   X   1NT = 8-10 (and don't do it if you don't want to play in NT)
1@d   X   2NT = 11-12
1@d   X   1y = 4+card, forcing (only if you don't mind to be raised)
1@d   X   2@c (2 over 1: strong 5-card, less than 10 pts, NF)
1@d   X   2@h (jump shift: 6-card, no outside defense, 4-6 pts to the Ace)

1@d   X   2NT "Flip-Flop" = pre-empt
1@d   X   3@d = limit raise
=> Partner can still play the 3NT

1@h/@s   X   2NT = Jordan, limit raise or better, 4+ support (some play 3+)

This concludes this presentation. Hope you enjoyed, Karen10|
