^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
He’s been mentoring in BIL for 2 years and lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

He learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |

^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play.

mitche: Bidding: Well, we have our first lengthy discussion.. how about 1@d - 1@s/2@c - 3@C/ 3NT???
When you have 4-4 shape in the minors and not a no-trump hand, it's usual to begin the bidding with 1@D, not 1@C
Reason: you then have a convenient rebid of 2@c, should your pard bid 1@S or 1NT
So East's first bid should be 1@d.|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: Whether she opens 1@C or 1@D, West wants to bid 1@S, not 1NT
We love major-suit fits, and so when you bypass both 1@H and 1@s to respond 1NT, you absolutely deny having a 4-card or longer major
So bid 1@S instead of 1N.
OK - after 1N, East now has a bit of a problem - her hand is not right to bid 2@D (a reverse here should show longer clubs than diamonds - for the reasons we just discussed above)|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: Similarly, 2@h, or 3@c are all horrible, so East decided on 2NT, the best of a very poor set or choices
After 2NT, showing a hand too strong to open 1NT, West has ample strength to bid 3NT.
A better bidding sequence might have been: 1@D - 1@S/ 2@C - 3@C/ 3NT|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt||at|Kib: Do you recommend this auction, so that the stronger hand declarers?
mitche: Well, not that the stronger hand declares, but rather, both players have bid their hands to show their hand patterns
Imagine that West had a slightly different hand (Change the @hA and the @sK to the club and diamond kings)
Then, after 2@C, West would bid 4@C and they have an easy time to 6@C ....
That is why we want to bid the hand pattern correctly. You and your partner get a much better idea of whether their hands fit well together...|

mitche: Play: in notrump, N decided to lead a heart, a reasonable choice. But please lead the @H3, not the 2. Defenders MUST exchange information with their signals, and using standard leads, the 3 is correct.
I am asking you all to use standard leads and carding... 
Next: Declarer decided to finesse in clubs. She led the @CJ because declarer is very short of entries.|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: But in order to preserve entries, she must then play the @C9 under the Jack
That way, she can eventualy lead the @C3  from the dummy  to finish running the club suit
you all see that?|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: One other minor point: declarer should lead a small diamond toward the Queen before she plays the diamond Ace. 
If you cash the ace first, You may get lucky and find a blocked diamond position - but if the suit breaks poorly, you could wind up losing 3 diamonds.|

mitche: bidding: The books say that you need 26 points to contract for game in a major - 
West has 19 HCP and East must have at least 5 or 6 to bid 2@S, right?
So West knows that the hands have a minimum of 24 or 25 HCP
Also, East's 2@S bid should show a maximum of a really, really bad 10 .. call it 9 points
So the maximum # of points is 29 or so, not enough for slam|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: Marty Bergen uses a line in his books, "He who knows, goes"
West can just bid 4@S, which is an easy make
A raise of 1@h or 1@S can be as bad as 6 HCP in standard bidding - and in standard bidding, the maximum is 9, because with 10 or more, responder would make a "limit raise" to show the better hand.|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: A Bergen raise of 3@D shows 9-11 HCP and 4 card support
A Bergen raise of 3@C shows about 6-8 points and 4 card support
If you don't use Bergen, there are other methods. But in any case, 1 -> 2 should show 6-9 HCP
The important point here is that West knows the hands are strong enough to play game, but almost surely not good enough for slam|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt||at|
So if you know that 4@S is where you want to play --- bid 4@s :)
sblitz:  If W had only 18 HCP, instead of 19, would he invite with 3@s?  E would probably accept even with only 7 HCP, when he (she) has the 9th @s?
mitche: If w has 18 HCP, depending on the hand's shape, she would still just blast off; or she might make a help suit  game try
But 18+7 = 25, and I think that almost everyone thinks that's enough strength (especially since we haven't talked about reevaluating West's hand)
I think a game try should be made on hands with about 16 points, after re-evaluation|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: Example: Change the @DA to the a small one. Now, with 16 points, W could bid 3@c. East would know that a holding of 3 or 4 small clubs is very bad help. And she would then just stop at 3@S
 sblitz:  But E could have 6 HCP and only 3 @s's.  Would that be enough for game against 18 HCP?  Isn't an invite safer than a jump to game?
mitche: Again: 18+6 = 24 HCP, and we dont know about distribution, etc. So I think that with 18 HCP, if pard raised 1@S to 2@S, I would almost always just bid game.|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: Sometimes it will be defeated, 
but c'est la vie ..
There is another advantage to blasting off. If you make a scientific game try, you help the defense by giving them some extra information about your strength and your hand's weakness. Anyone here see the Harry Potter movies?|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt||at|
really! Your kids didn't drag you to see them???
OK- you may rememer Hagrid, the giant, would blab and say, "Oops - I shoudl'na said that"
same idea here - don't tell the defenders anything that will help them - unless you really do need to explore. As in hand 1
OK - let's play some bridge!!|

mitche: bidding: South's opening 1@s is pretty minimum. 
When the auction then gets to East, she has a choice of 3 bids: a) 2@h b) 1NT c) double
I think 2@h is the best alternative. 1NT is possible, showing a balanced hand with 10-14 HCP and a stopper in spades. 
Double is just too weird for words, :) because the very last thing East wants to hear is something like 3@d|
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: So 2@h is the best bid.
West's hand is just on the edge of being worth a 2@S cue bid, showing a limit (10 points or more) raise in hearts.
If West guesses to bid 2@s, EW will get to the 4@H game. But is that a good idea?|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: Probably not. West's queen is not likely to be worth very much, and the hand is pretty nearly flat. 
So 3@H seems right to me. 
(Note: I slipped a convention in on you all: if your hand is worth 10 support points or more for your partner's overcalled suit - and you have 4 card support (or even a very good 3 card holding) then a cue bid shows your values..|
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


sk|w|nt||at| 
mitche: example: your LHO opens 1@C and your partner overcalls 1@h. You have West's hand.
You just bid 2@c to show that kind of hand
wobur123:  When do you jump in P's suit?  3@H with 10 and 4 card support?
mitche: People play that an immediate raise of the suit shows the same kind of hand that you'd raise an opening bid of 1@H to 2...|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


sk||nt||at|
mitche: A double raise is always preemptive, showing a weak hand, a probable singleton somewhere, and 4 card support
So the answer is: anytime you have 10 points and good 3 card or longer support, CUE BID!!|

mitche: Now, on to the opening lead. What does South know? Only that North could not find enough strength to bid over 1@S
So the lead should not be from a broken holding, such as KJ10xx
If S felt very lucky, he might try the @DK - but a trump would be my choice
A trump gives declarer no help.. As it happens, declarer can always score 2 spade tricks eventually, but when S leads a spade, it might cost his side a trick in the suit|
pg| ***** 96 ***** |

mitche: After that, the play was pretty much standard and OK.
But the opening lead was not very helpful to the defense

mitche: bidding: South has a problem when the bidding gets to her. The heart suit is kind of thin - but the hand is just too good to pass. So 1@h is it, I guess... 
Should South bid over 2@C? What do you think??|
pg| ***** 112 ***** |

analisals: yes but what?
BILAsst10: bid what?  seems to have no bid
azin: 2@h
gypsy1308: already told my hand|
pg| ***** 113 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: What S can reopen with is a double. 
If S doubles, then N bids 2@h
But should South even have the problem?
Let's look at East's 2 bids: Some people would bid 1@S instead of 1@d with the East hand.|
pg| ***** 114 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: This is called "Walsh-style" responses, where,if pard opens 1@c, you bid a 4 card major instead of a 4 (or even 5) card @D suit
In this style, If you do respond 1@D to 1@C, you pretty much deny having a 4 card major.
And if you do later bid a major (on your own), it is 100% game forcing. like a reverse...
But unless you are using that style, 1@d is fine.|
pg| ***** 115 ***** |


nt||at|
Wayne_LV:  I planned 2 bids therefore bid the 5 card minor ahead of the major.
(Later developments caused me to change my plan)
mitche: But what should East do after 2@C?|
pg| ***** 116 ***** |


nt||at|
Wayne_LV:  p denies 4 spades and we dont have the stuff for a minor game
mitche: The hand has 10 HCP and a lovely singleton in hearts, the suit that was overcalled
West promised 6 clubs with the rebid of 2@C, so with the East hand, I would raise to 3@C
West is not interested in game, so she will pass 3@C -- west doesnt know about the spades, so bidding anything other than 2@c (and passing 3@C) is asking for trouble
Wayne_LV:  I don't understand why a raise to 3c with no hope of a game|
pg| ***** 117 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: East does not know that there isn't any hope for game..
west will not always have a 10-point opener. She could easily have the @SA and a heart stopper
Wayne_LV:  p shows a min hand.  Even with 13 hcp,  no shot at 3NT and definitely not 5@c
mitche: Wayne ... West could have a hand like Axx, QJ10, x, KQJ10xx 
Now 3NT is 100% on ice. |
pg| ***** 118 ***** |


nt||at| 
jdbowman: West stretched HC points with void for opener, east cannot assume only 10 HC pts
BILAsst10: so 3@C leaves 3NT up to West?
mitche: No, 3@C merely shows the value of the East hand!! 
Mitch's rule: (and Lew Stansby's rule, who taught it to me) - I just bid what I have and let pard make the decisions|
pg| ***** 119 ***** |


nt||at| 
mitche: I worked at a small computer company back in the 1970's and Lew had not yet won his 5 world championships, but he was kind enough to answer some questions. At that time I was into making "master bids" - i.e. trying to bid both sides of the table. 
Lew straightened me out by reminding me that I have a partner for a reason.
And that reason is to get to the partnership's best spot....|
pg| ***** 120 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: So East should just bid what he has, and what he has is a 3@C raise over 2@C
BILAsst10: perhaps 4@C if reevaluate - but that would bypass 3NT
mitche: Who, East?
No... 3NT is still the game of choice, and if you bypass it, you are essentiall commiting to a club game or slam.. 
So 3@c is just fine. It shows about 10-11 dummy points.|
pg| ***** 121 ***** |


nt||at| 
mitche: Now, if we have beaten up S and E, it's time to ask -- should N have bid over 2@C?
Would N raise a 1@h bid to 2@h?
I think so
maspd: playing lott defenitely yes
mitche: So, if you would raise an opening bid of 1@h to 2, then I would give strong consideration to raising a 1@h overcall to 2|
pg| ***** 122 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: There is another thing to consider: S came into a "live" auction. EW had both bid and partner passed...
So for S to bid here should show a good hand. Or a pretty good suit. Or both
So as N, I would strain to bid 2@h here
So - how should the auction go?|
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: 1@C - 1@d  (1@h)/2@c (2@h) 3@C ???
S may try 3@h (because she has a whale of a hand with her club void, and the outside aces and king)
Well I was thinking to tell you all south might bid 3@d, but that is really stretching things for you. 
So S will bid 3@h and that should end the auction. |
pg| ***** 124 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: 3@h is going to play very poorly because of the 4-1 split.. but that is just unlucky... 
Have we yakked enough on this hand for all of you??
Here is the key point in the bidding: N has a 2@h bid, and E has a 3@C bid. 
After that, s's 3@h is kind of unlucky to result in a contract that will go down probably 2 tricks|
pg| ***** 125 ***** |


nt||at|
dee_dee_20: if N  bids 2@h   can E bid 3@h asking for @h stopper for 3nt?
mitche: I think that it's kind of iffy. .. East might do that, but 3NT was not a good idea... the defence takes a couple of spades, a heart, and 2 diamonds|

mitche: bidding: EW bid sensibly to get to 1N - NS may well have competed in hearts, which may have helped EW to get to 2 spades
So I think the bidding was sensible|

mitche: Play: S led the @HK and N correctly played the 8 to encourage S to continue the suit
But N was a bit too eager with her play of overtaking the @HQ
Surely, S has more than KQ doubleton, so it must be safe to allow her to continue the suit|
pg| ***** 159 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: One other point. S wanted N to lead a diamond (to assure the 1-trick set) 
so she should have discarded the @D7, not the 3|

Questions?
rcv:  why not bid 2@S instead of 1nt?
mitche: East's bid of 1N seemed OK. And if EW agreed that a raise of responder's major suit promised 3 or more card support, then 2@s would have been preferable.
BUT - I think most of you think that a raise of responder's suit shows 4 card support|
pg| ***** 161 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: (you may argue that KQ10 is good enough to pretend that you have 4 card support, and I would agree, 
but for the most part, make sure that you and your pard discuss whether a raise could be on 3 cards...|

mitche: bidding:
When you use a Texas transfer, I think it wise to have a singleton somewhere, 
That said, EW were kind of unlucky for the trumps to be stacked so poorly|
pg| ***** 171 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: Oh, why should the Texas transfer hand have a singleton? Because the Texas bid is made on length in the trump suit. 
If your hand is semi-balanced, the NT opener needs a maximum to cover all of your losers, 
and your trumps aren't as valuable because you aren’t ruffing anything with them|
pg| ***** 172 ***** |


nt||at|
rcv:  When N doubles does that ask for a @D lead?
mitche: No, had N wanted a @D, she would double 4@D.  
So s was correct to lead a club. 
A spade is clearly wrong, and without the double of 4@D, there's no reason to lead the suit.
And a trump here is almost as wrong as leading a small spade|

mitche: Play: one sneaky thing, East should play the queen or jack of spades, instead of the king. 
Reason: S may be caught napping and duck the ace.
Then you may be able to ditch a spade on a diamond 
But when you play the @SK, S has no reason to play low|
pg| ***** 188 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Thanks to Eileen for her generous assistance and to all of you for your courteous attention and thought-provoking questions
I want also to compliment you all for what was a generally high level of play, especially compared to some of the play when we started doing this last year..
Keep playing, read a good bridge book (Kantar, Bergen, or Mike Lawrence are great!), and have a super week|

^b@2From : Various sources

When Partner opens 1NT or 2NT, jump responses of 4@d or 4@h are transfers to 4@h and 4@s
Generally, reponder wants to be in game, but has no slam interest.

Opener              Responder       Opener
1NT or 2NT      4@d                  4@h
                          4@h                  4@s 

The idea behind this convention is simular to that behind Jacoby transfers - 
it is better for opener to be declarer, since his high cards wont be exposed to the defenders.

Using both transfer conventions, responding to both 1NT and 2NT, Root/Pavlicek recommend the following understanding:

1. Texas, then pass is sign off in game, therefore:
2. Jacoby, then raise to game is a mild slam try (it is not forcing but opener is invited to bid again with a maximum)
3. Jacoby, then 4NT is defined as a quantitative slam invitation, therefore:
4. Texas, then 4NT is Blackwood (or RKCB)

Texas Transfers are "on" in competition through 3@c

1NT        (2-3@c)         4@d = transfer to @h
	            (2@d)            4@h = transfer to @s
	            (3@d)            4@h = Natural, not a transfer|

^b@2
Responders options with a 6-card Major:

1NT       2@h
2@s        - pass or:
             - 3@s = invite with a 6-card, 7-8 pts or:
             - 4@s = 8+ pts, mild slam try (as you went through Jacoby transfers, without singleton or void)
             - 4@c/@d/@h = Splinter (a jump after a transfer)

1NT       4@h
4@s        - pass = sign off or:
             - 4NT = BLW (or RKCB), setting the suit first.

making:

1NT       2@h
2@s        - 4NT = quantitative, with a 5-card @s


Another auction where Texas would apply:


2@c         2@d
2NT       - 4@d = Texas Transfer


This concludes Mitche's session and I hope you enjoyed the presentation.   Karen10|
