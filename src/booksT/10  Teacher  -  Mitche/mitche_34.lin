^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||at|


^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

mitche: Hi, everyone and welcome to tonight's 2 over 1 bid, play and discuss session.
2 over 1 means: 
If your partner opens in first or second seat and you bid a non-jump 2 level bid, it is game-forcing.
Also if pard opens 1@H or 1@s in first/second seat, your response of 1NT (with no intervening bid) 
is forcing for 1 round .  Otherwise, the bidding looks a lot like SA|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||at|92612:  Mitch, do you use reverse Bergen with 2/1? And do you use Drury?
mitche: I prefer regular Bergen, not reverse because you need the game invite more over the weaker response
Yes, 2-way reverse, but any Drury agreement is useful. 
There are very few GF auctions: 
1@S- 2@C, or 1@S-2@D, or  1@S – 2@H or  1@H - 2@C, or  1@H - 2@D or  1@D – 2@C

sk||pc|s2|at|mitche: Bidding: I wonder if any of you would have made a different bid and why?
princesess: Could I bid michaels here?
mitche: I think first of all that I would have bid 2@S, Michaels, here, especially at matchpoints.
The suits are both reasonably good, and the distribution is, too
But let's for the moment say that E passed. What do you think of south's 2@S?|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||at|7047:  With singleton, it seems okay
altak38:  ... and 3 spades with an honor
mitche: Modern treatment is to use a single raise as "constructive", 
showing 7-9 dummy points and 3 card support
So I think the hand is a bit too thin to raise directly. 
Better is to start with 1NT forcing, and then to bid 2@S (or pass if pard bids 2@S)|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Reason for not bidding 2@S is - give pard a sound 16 point hand 
(instead of the minimum opener north has... ) He will be making a game try and you will be at the  3 level ...
So that 2@S raise needs some minimum strength. Most pairs use 7 points as a minimum
With a weaker hand as responder, start with a forcing 1NT and then either pass 2@S or correct anything else to 2@S|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||at|kat827:  What is your point count for S's hand, responding to 1@S?
mitche: S has 5 or 6 points.. I would evaluate it as 6 because of the 5-card @D suit
1NT can be as few as a "good" 5 (or even 4, if the 4 is an Ace!), up to a good 12. 
There are some people who also use 1NT forcing to show the 16-18 NT hand 
(because 2NT is Jacoby they use 3NT over 1@S to show that 13-15 HCP balanced hand)|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||at|BILAsst10: Guess North could have as many as 20/21 HCP and distributional hand
mitche: Yes.. and you do not want that 19-20 point hand to get to game opposite zero aces or kings... 
not with 3 card support, anyway ... 
OK - so S might try 1NT 
But she raised to 2@S. 
What should W do with the best hand at the table?|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Some of you like 2NT, would you consider double?
fm75:  Not without biddable suit.
7047:  I thought my X promised 4 @H's
altak38:  she does have enough points for a double but no suit of her own and what if p bids @D?|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: I personally prefer the 2NT call; 
My 18 point hand is actually almost too good for it (4 aces is worth more than 16 HCP!!)
But the spades are singly-stopped, and pard is marked with a weak hand on the auction 
(the fact that S is about a king light for her 2@S bid means that from West's perspective,  
East could have 2 or 3 hcp at most)
Anyway, west doubled and N passed. What should East do now?|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: If EAST trusts partner, she should bid 4@H!!!
Why?|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


at|
West has forced East to bid at the 3 level on what could be zero points. Right?
East has a pretty good hand, considering all the bidding. 
She has TWO decent 5 card suits.. And pard is certain to have at least 3 hearts for the double.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: And you all remember Marty Bergen's line "5-5-come alive" 
- well, here is the time to come alive... 
I evaluate it as 6 HCP, 1 point for each 5 card suit, and 4 more for distribution. 
So I am blasting off!
In fact, with best play declarer can make 12 tricks on a spade lead |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Key points: 
The "constructive" raise, the 5-5-come alive mantra, and the double that forces you to the 3 level shows a powerhouse

sk||pc|d8|at|mitche: Bidding: .. I must confess, the way this bidding proceeded, 
I thought someone had slipped in a Pinochle deck 
Let's look at S hand.. it has great shape, but it is a bit too thin for an opening bid
It lacks 2 quick tricks and it really would be best to plan to make a defensive bid 
(either unusual NT or some other kind of 2-suited overcall) than to open|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt||at|Pard will expect an opener in first seat to have at least AK K or AQ A or the equivalent somewhere in the hand.
If you open this kind of hand (vulnerable), you will be giving up a few -500's 
when pard doubles off their spade game|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt||at|Now, the 1NT overcall looks about right, and N has enough strength to double.
The double of 1NT here is strictly Penalty.
It says, "Pard, you have some kind of opening hand, worth 13 points somewhere, and I have around 10.. 
We own the hand!
If you double an opening bid of 1NT, it should be penalty-oriented.|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt||at|Recall the number of times you have 18 points in your hand when your RHO has 1NT?  
It's almost as often as the politicians in Washington making sense. 
And that, folks, is next to never. |
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So you want to use the double of an OPENING 1NT for something else. 
See DONT or Cappelletti writeups on BBO
I edit Marty's books, so I am under contract to like DONT :) :)|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Anyway the X of 1NT by responder says "we have the balance of strength"
If you play "systems on" over 1NT overcalls, then you need to discuss and learn and use the Lebensohl convention. Or even better, "Rubinsohl", (transfer lebensohl)
Certainly the E hand wants to play spades, and so 2@H was intended as a transfer, and this makes sense|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt||at|fm75:  If you were allowed only one convention, beyond stayman and jacoby transfers, Lebensohl might be the one.
mitche: Anyway. 2@S would be fine. 
If East is really feeling her oats, she might bid 2NT, to invite pard to pass with bad spade support or bid 3@S, 3NT, or 4@S depending on how good the 1NT  overcall was|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: REMEMBER!! N/S have already said they have the balance of strength with the double of 1NT, so blasting off to 4@S needs a much better spade suit and some wilder distribution. 
azin: Please opine on super accept in uncontested auction and here after a double - assuming Marty Bergen is not watching us:)
mitche: I love super acceptance, 
But here, West should know that someone is lying about his/her strength..|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


nt||at|When the bidding gets to 4@S, N would like to double. 
Why?|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


at|
He still thinks his pard has 2 quick tricks, and he is looking at a lot of picture cards.

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Should E/W be able to make 4@S?
Iowa Field:  what about the lead?  Was it correct?
mitche: Let's guess that N leads a @D, Now declarer has to keep her outside losers to 2 more. 
She has a certain spade and a sure club loser.
Is there a way for her to hold her club losers to 1?|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


nt||at|altak38: If p cashes @dA and then leads @cQ E/W are set but that's a lot to expect
mitche: Yes, at trick 2, S must find a shift.  
And the @CQ will beat the hand, because she will get to ruff with the @S2|
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


nt||at|
fm75:  Eliminate red suits before last spade? And use the spade to force N/S to lead after reds eliminated.
mitche: It was worth ducking the @H into the KJ for 2 reasons: 
a) you do not need to ruff a heart and 
b) you are in your hand at trick 5, where you can ruff a diamond, 
and then cash the @HA and lead a small club

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: East has a difficult choice for opening lead.
On the bidding, I am not sure that there's much better than the @C 
But here is the problem: Leading a small club looks to West like E has an honor
And leading the 9 looks like the top of a doubleton 
But I would lead the 9 anyway, because W should be able to guess that the N hand has just 4 clubs 
(if N held 5, then he would also have at least 5 diamonds. Possible, but somewhat  unlikely)|
pg| ***** 100 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: There really isn’t any good way to play this holding.. 
fm75:  If p Australian, then mud :)
mitche: Read Kantar on mud. He also says you should lead low and hope pard can work out the honor situation. 
Here it doesn’t matter
Kantar HATES mud
Anyway- after the club lead, declarer counts 2 spades, a heart, and possibly a diamond. 
And he needs to worry about a bad trump split, too|
pg| ***** 101 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: I think the best line is, when East shows out on the second round of trumps, 
to play spades and lose his losers early. 
He can then hope to get 2 ruffs in.
Also, when W does regain the lead, she should lead a HEART, not the spade. 
Declarer doesn't have 4 spades. He bid 3@C over the negative X
So pard will have 3 spades.|
pg| ***** 102 ***** |


nt||at|Leading a heart will make declarer have to lead spades. 
It didn’t matter here, but it would be best to lead pard's suit rather than the unsupported ace
btour:  How does @SJ lead fair for opening lead?
mitche: A spade is good, (spade 10, if you use coded jacks, 10's and 9's) but hard to find

pc|s8|at|mitche: Bidding: 1@C and 1@D seem about right.. 
but I'd rather see S bid his hand a bit differently
The jump to 5@D kills all chances for N/S to look for their best playing spot. 
They might be making 4 or 5 NT or even have a club  or diamond slam
Better is to start with 2@C, which says (by pretty nearly universal agreement) "limit raise or better ".. or "I am going to take control of the auction"|
pg| ***** 110 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: If, for example, N had the @HK instead of the @HQ, 6@D would be cold - the opening bid marks W for every missing high card in the deck
fm75:  OK. but from my perspective, I know opener has majors and I see 3 losers in majors
mitche: Fred, it is almost always worth it to bid what you have and let partner in on the secret. 
Your jump to 5@D could have cost your side a slam bonus...|
pg| ***** 111 ***** |


nt||at|Not to pick on Fred - 
I remember a lesson I got from a coworker of mine many many years ago. 
Lew Stansby (multiple time world champ) worked with me back in 1974, when I knew even less about bridge than I do now. 
I was just beginning to play, and I asked him a question, expecting him to have some clever master bid. 
He just made a simple rebid of his 5 card suit - and I asked him why he didn’t just bid 3NT. 
His answer was "I just bid my hand and let partner make all the hard decisions"|
pg| ***** 112 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: If that works for a 7 time Spingold winner and world champ, I guess it's good enough for all of us
So just practice bidding what you have! 
And S has a 2@C hand, saying "very strong" or "diamond support and 10+ points"

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: I think E may as well lead the @HJ 
It's the only chance she will have to make a lead that might promote something
(either that or the @C8 - there is something to be said to leading pard's so-called suit 
Actually, leading a major was a pretty good idea, since South's 5@D blast certainly says he can stand a club lead|
pg| ***** 127 ***** |


nt||at|ELIZA42: Thought I might be leading his suit
mitche: I dunno.. your lead is a guess, and since you don't expect to generate a ruff, leading the heart will help more frequently than a spade, I think, and given your heart length, it is less likely to blow a trick (declarer won't have a heart suit to set up). 
Leading a spade either works well or not at all...
Once declarer escapes a @H lead, he has 12 tricks

sk||pc|c9|at|mitche: Bidding: Let's see where the bidding might have gone and if getting to 6 is reasonable.
1@S looks right, and West is planning to make a 3-card limit raise in spades - right?
The thing is, west might take a more optimistic view of his hand and bid 2@C instead of 1NT
With a 6 card suit and a singleton and his points in aces and kings, he might feel that his hand can be upgraded
East will be pretty happy to hear 2@C|
pg| ***** 137 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: She will bid 2@H, and W will bid 2@S
Now they know they are headed for game (in spades) and can control bid to show controls in every suit. 
Then, declarer may get to 6@S 
- she will discard a club on the @DK and avoid the need to guess the location of the @CQ

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: After the club lead, though, E should make all 13 tricks 
- 6 clubs, 5 spades, and the @DAK
And the simple line is: win the first club, play off the @DA (it ain’t getting ruffed!), pull trumps, 
cash @DK and run the clubs to discard all the hearts|
pg| ***** 152 ***** |


nt||at|boleo1: what about lead a singleton?
mitche: Well, it works if N has either a club winner or a quick trump entry, so it's pretty reasonable. 
When the opponents bid aggressively to a game, they will usually make it if you  defend passively
So you should look to attack and the lead of a singleton in an unbid side suit is a good way to develop tricks|

sk||pc|cj|at|msphola:  what did the 2NT bid mean?
fm75:  by PA it is Lebensohl, partner bids 3@C which I can pass or correct.
mitche: IT IS NEVER LEBENSOHL
It is not possible for OPENER to demand RESPONDER bid 3@C  !!!|
pg| ***** 163 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: And 2NT has a natural meaning of the kind of hand that would have jumped to 2NT over responder's 1 over 1 response. 
In other words, it shows 18-19 balanced points.|
pg| ***** 164 ***** |


nt||at|There is another reason for S not to bid here, even if he thinks that 2NT were a relay .. 
There is no reason to expect N to have a fit with S in clubs.  
And with a minimum 4333  opener, bidding to the 3 level when both opps are bidding and pard is passing 
- well, it is an invitation for the defenders to double and collect more than the value of their game in penalties|
pg| ***** 165 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So I recommend you rethink how you use 2NT, N/S.... 
sebstar: Should they have gotten to 4?
mitche: E/W should not get to 4.. East has a constructive raise (7-9 points and 3 spades) and W has a balanced 14.
There's no reason to think 4@S has much of a shot.|
pg| ***** 166 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: If you prefer to use modern losing count, East's hand has 9 losers and West has 7
So they are at full limit (maybe even over limit) at 3@S

up|45|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: When N leads the @CJ, S knows the location of the @CQ. 
It is in declarer's hand
The other thing is- if S has any kind of hand and 5 clubs, he would have raised clubs somewhere along the line.
In any case, E/W have the KQ of clubs between them
S should therefore play an encouraging @C8 and not the Ace at trick 1|
pg| ***** 180 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: If W wins the singleton @CQ, then he never wins a trick with the king. 

fm75:  Wait for us to go down 2...for -100....do they know enough to X?
mitche: At least some will make a double, and why offer -300 on a part-score hand???|
