^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

at|mitche: Bidding: S has the right shape, but not enough strength to make a negative double. 
What do you think is the minimum strength for a negative X that forces partner to the 2-level? |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at|
Sort of a trick question. But the accepted minimum is a good 8 point hand.

If you happen to have support for opener's minor, you may bid on a poor 8 count.  
The idea is you need some safety for forcing the bidding to the 2-level, and 8 points is the usual 
cut-off point for forcing pard to the 2-level. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||

at|mitche:  You should figure that pard has a 4-card minor.  Unless he is 4-4 in the majors or 4333,
he will have a 4 card suit.  So the chances of partner having 4 clubs (when someone overcalls his 1@C with
1 of a major) are pretty good.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


sk|w|at|  

Some WEST players might bid 3@S with that hand, following the Law of Total Tricks.  If you do, be
prepared to go down 1 or 2, because a jump to 3@S should (in my opinion, anyway), not be made with
a flat hand, even with a 4-card support.

pg| ***** 28 ***** |


at|mitche: Bidding: West's giraffe is best handled with a Michaels Cue bid.
 
Basically, if RHO opens 1 of a minor, an immediate bid of 2 of that minor advertises 5-5 or better in
the majors.  If RHO opens 1 of a Major, a cue bid of 2 of that major promises 5-5 in the other major and
an unspecified minor.
So if E/W were using Michaels cue bids, W would bid 2@H to show spades and a minor.  East, recognizing
that they have an 8 card spade fit, would think to raise spades in competition.|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So that is how W could have handled her wild 2-suiter.  If East wanted to know which minor
West holds, he would bid 2NT - this does not promise a heart stopper, but instead ^*bconventionally^*n
asks W for her minor.|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt||sk|n|at|
Let's look at 3NT bid by north.  It has the advantage of being a "practical" bid, but it also has
the disadvantage of missing a heart slam (not an easy one to bid or make, by the way).

I think that unless N/S have agreed to "mandatory reopening doubles", 3NT has some merits, it is simple
and most of the time, you can still get to the right spot.  |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt||
at|ecolodge:  I was just stuck, Mitch . . . didn't know what else to bid to let my p know I had opening too.
mitche:  Yes, N hand is sticky.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


sk|s|at|
What was 4@C?  Gerber?  A suit?  I think most players would treat it as ace-asking. 
By the way, I believe that Gerber is a baby-food, not a bridge convention.
We can discuss ace-asking bids at another time. 
But in any case, with S hand, if I don't pass 3NT (and I would not pass 3NT), I would bid 4@H 
gypsy1308:  gerber|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Reason: 3NT should show at least 1 heart, and I can play for at most 1 heart loser, and the 
3NT bid should cover most of my other minor suit losers -- And 4@C can be misconstrued,
So in a casual partnership, I go for the bid least likely to be misunderstood.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


sk|w|at|
One other point.  West, having not bid 2@H (Michaels), decided to bid 4@D.  How many of you like that bid?
I think it is a pretty good idea. With 11 cards in 2 suits, the chances are pretty good that we will be able
to take a lot of tricks one way or the other.
This time, 4@S is a  disaster and a half, and 4@D is not much better.   But the bid should be made.

at|mitche: Play: A player wants to know what I would have led. I don’t know what's right, but I guess to
lead the @DA and continue the suit because:

a) I have 6, my LHO promises to have at least a couple.(she bid 3NT), and 
b) I might get lucky and find pard for a ruff. 

I do not lead the @SA because LHO advertised strength in the suit (with 3NT) |

a) Michaels cue bids are a very commonly-played convention, and it's worth knowing, even if you don't play

sk||

at|mitche: Bidding: 
a) The 1NT response by N was correct, showing any 6 - 12 HCP hand, essentially. It is forcing.
b) S correctly bid 2@C.  For her to rebid 2@S would promise 6 of them.

But 2@H was not the best bid N could have made.  It should show a hand with good hearts and not much else. 
In particular, most pairs play it as either a very good 5 or more probably, 6 card suit.
N should take a "false preference" to 2@S |
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  S should know that north has just a 2-card support. With a 3-card support and a 7-to-10 point hand,
N would bid 2@S directly.  So S won’t get carried away by 2@S.

If N has a 6-card @H suit (or a good 5 bagger), then even with 16 points, S would probably be wiser to pass 2@H
Here is why: If N has, say @HQJ10xxx and an outside king, then her hand will produce 5 tricks in a heart 
contract.  But it might be worthless at NT|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  You all see that South's hand is all "prime", containing solid values that would win tricks in @h or NT
So if N really does have that weak 6-bagger in hearts, the partnership does best losing just 2 or 3 hearts and an Ace. 
Remember this point in 2 over 1 (and SA)-- A long, weak suit likes to be trumps opposite a notrump-type hand.

calligal: Would the N hand be worthless at NT because S cannot get to the hearts except with the @CA?
mitche:  Yes, that is the general idea... If N's hearts are long and weak, they're more valuable as the trump suit.

at|mitch:  Play:  East attacked hearts at trick 1, which seems like as good an idea as any. 
If I were declarer, I would ask "where are my 8 tricks coming from?" 
N/S have 3 clubs, 2 spades, 1 heart (with the lead), and 1 diamond.  Declarer needs 1 more trick.

If clubs divide 3-3 that is 8.  If not then one will have to come from somewhere else.  I would hope
for a favorable spade division and lead the @SA and @sK. This sets up the extra tricks any time the suit
splits 3-3 OR if either opponent has a doubleton honor.  It loses only if someone has @SQJxx(x)|

Important point. When I have a 5-2 fit in a suit, and I have AK1098, the best play for 4 tricks
is to cash the ace and king.

at|mitche: Although West has a nice hand, it is not quite an opening bid. If you use the idea of a "bergen 20"
West's hand is a bergen 19. 
You might say that if E has a spade fit, it's a 7-loser hand,  but I am not worried about being outbid when I have spades.   
So I would (playing Standard or 2 over 1) pass and wait for things to develop.|

Next: What to do with a good hand when you have support and RHO overcalls?
East has a nice hand with spade support. |
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Modern style, going back about 20 years or so is to treat the jump to 3@S here as weak, 
showing 4 spades and a maximum of about 6 points.
So if West read the bid that way, he passes.
The other half of that treatment:  An immediate cue bid (3@D in this case) says "limit raise or better" in spades, 
but usually that requires a 4th spade.|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So what should East do??
She should double 2@D - a negative double! 
If W bids 2@S or 2NT she raises to 3@S, and if W bids clubs, her hand's good enough to bid 4@S
And of course, 2@H should get 4@H from East.|
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


sk|n|at|
WestElsdon:  I was considering 1NT over the 1@S.   What if I had done that?
1NT would have been fine. I would like a better second spade (the 10, maybe), so as to give me a shot at a second stopper, but 1NT would have been good. |
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


nt||sk|e|
at|mitche:  If N overcalled 1NT, what should East bid??
ecolodge:  X?
Cliff228: 2@S
mitche:  I am closing the voting. and cast my vote for double.
If you have 9 or more HCP, and the auction goes 1 plum by partner in first or second seat, 1NT by your RHO,
you double. |
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


nt||sk||
at|mitche:  It is a penalty X, saying we have the balance of power and we should be able to beat 1NT.
WestElsdon:  Is that DONT?
mitche:  No, that is standard American, precision, Acol, and pretty much every other bidding system I know.
If pard promises a 13 point hand (or good 12), you double to say "the hand is ours".
Had that happened, S would bid 2@H (he cannot sit 1NT-X), and then N/S would be in 2@H doubled, down 1 or 2,
depending on defense.|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


nt||
at|amcs:  Is it a support dbl?
mitche:  NO it is NOT a support double.   It is a Penalty double!!!!
A support X is a different animal altogether.
You open 1 plum, your pard bids 1 grape. RHO overcalls 1 or 2 bananas. 
If you cannot bid 1 fruit salad, a double says "I have a 3-card support for your grapes"
(or 2 fruit salads).
Support doubles are alertable, and they aren’t standard. Discuss with your partner before using them!!!|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


nt||
at|BILAsst10: Is opener supposed to pass the penalty double?
mitche:  If the auction went  1@S-(1NT)-X-(Pass)  then opener usually passes unless he has something worth mentioning,
like a chance for a vulnerable game.. 
but with a sound minimum opening bid, opener should probably pass.

amcs:  What does east bid if there is no overcall?
mitche:  If the auction went 1@S-(pass)-  I would bid 1NT and then raise spades to the 3 level.

at|mitche: S properly played the 3 of diamonds, saying, "I do not have anything encouraging in diamonds"
North guessed to shift, but the better one is a small trump. You aren't giving up anything by your shift. 

West decided to take a "practice finesse" as Eddie Kantar calls them - in @s's
What is a practice finesse?  |
pg| ***** 102 ***** |

After the club shift, the club suit is established,

nt||
at|mitche:  If the finesse loses, the defense scores 2 spades, a heart and the diamond. 
If declarer had been in 4@S, he would hope to play @SA, take a pitch on the @H and a second one on the @c.
This requires trumps to behave, for the clubs to be 3-3 and the @HK to be onside (or for the long club to be
with the long trump).  But in 3@S, it's too far-fetched (and could lead to defeat if the hearts do not split).

at|mitche:  Bidding:  North's 4@D bid would not win too many bidding contests, I fear. 
If N wanted to preempt, 3@D would be plenty.
But N does not want to preempt. Not yet.  With 4 good spades, I think I would bid 1@S.      Why?  |

ecolodge:  In case S has 4@S's?
mitche:  For certain, that is 1 reason.    Second reason..   What suit would N like led?
Cliff228: spades
mitche:  And N will almost surely get the chance to raise diamonds later on.|
pg| ***** 109 ***** |


nt||at|But he will not have the chance to bid spades cheaply ever again - 
or until the end of this deal, whichever comes first.
calligal: What would have happened if I had bid 4@H over the 4@D knowing my p doubled?
mitche:  If East bids 4@H, she will play it there, undoubled, losing 2 spades, 2 diamonds,
and unless the defense slips, a club.

at|mitche:  Play:  The defense has 4 tricks. And declarer has 9.  There is no way for anyone
to take more or less.  
Only one comment: When East was in with the @HA, do you remember the @H she led back? |
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


at|
It was the 7.   Declarer guessed to insert the 9, which forced the king.
Here it did not matter (declarer gets 9 tricks all the time), 
but East should return the @HJ, top of a sequence.|

but the correct card, too.

at|mitche: Bidding:  East has an excuse for opening 1@C, I guess, 
and if your style is to open Bergen 20's, this is one of them. 
Although I would be happier opening if the @DQ were the @HQ.
And when the bidding comes to North, he has a clear-cut pass.    Why?
According to the "rule of 15": In 4th seat, add your HCP to the number of spades you have. 
Open only if that number is at least 15.|
pg| ***** 127 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  The idea is: 
If the opps can outbid you at the 1 or 2 level by bidding spades, you are likely to go minus, 
so rather than risking a minus score, pass.
Over the long haul, you come out ahead.
This is especially true when your style is to open light.

at|mitche: Bidding: The bidding was pretty much what I expected.
If E/W were playing something called "puppet stayman", then East's 3NT was correct,
denying a 4 card major.
There is no reason for W to remove NT (2NT = 22-24 HCP) with a flat minimum. 
3@C is stayman, and very standard in this auction.|
pg| ***** 130 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  It may have been "puppet stayman", which I would rather not cover tonite.
Most pairs play "systems on" in this auction, so transfers and stayman are in effect.

at|mitch:  Play:  East properly played the @SJ at trick 1 and finessed the @C10 at trick 2.
She then cashed out, but she also did not notice that the @DJ10 fell under the @DA and @DK,
so her 9 was also a winner.

Wishing you a happy Valentine's Day with lots of love and affection from your S.O (Significant Other) 
and pleasant weather - sooner or later!! 
See you next week :)
