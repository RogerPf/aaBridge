^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
He’s been mentoring in BIL for 2 years and lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

He learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|

^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play.

mitche: Hi, everyone and welcome to tonight's 2 over 1 play and discuss session.
two over 1 means: If your partner opens in first or second seat and you bid a non-jump 2 level 
bid, it is game-forcing.
Also if pard opens 1@H or 1@s in first/second seat, your response of 1NT (with no intervening bid) 
is forcing for 1 round .  Otherwise, the bidding looks a lot like SA

If the bid was intended to be strong, the hand is much too weak.
I would have contented myself with bidding 2@c and rebidding 3@c if possible. This is an awkward hand for S to bid
  |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: after 3@c, I am not sure what North's 4@d was. 
If N thought 3@c was weak, he should pass, since Ax  is great support for a long club suit and weak hand.
If N thought 3@C was strong, there isn't any need to jump, since you expect to be in game anyway
wawa2: I thought it was strong, but mis-clickt, I meant 3@d
mitche: If I were N and interpreted 3@C as strong, I would just rebid my 6 card @D suit and wait for S to clarify his holding, either by bidding 3NT or a strong major suit holding|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: I think the auction should be 
1@D - 2@C/2@d - 3@c/ If N guesses to pass, he's a genius... 
But I am not a genius, so I would bid 3@h over 3@c, hoping partner could bid 3NT
There's a lot of room for partnership discussion. A lot of very strong players do play 3@C as just invitational in the sample auction
Others (myself included) play it as 100% game forcing. The moral of the story is to discuss it with your partner :)|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||at|wawa2: what justifies 3@H?
mitche: In the model auction, if you treat 3@c as still forcing, 3@h says "I have a heart honor - 
If you can stop spades, please bid 3NT"
As it happens, 3NT is not a bad contract, it might not make, because the @D 10 sets up as a defensive trick, but 3NT is a nice place to stop
Do you see the thinking behind the 3@h bid?|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||at|It's actually not a convention. It is just common-sense bridge. 3@c, no matter how you take it, should mean "no 4-card major"
So when you bid the suit at the 3 level, you (logically) cannot be looking to play a heart contract
So what else could 3@h mean? It means, "I am looking for 3NT"
Exactly like a cue bid!|

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: : When you get to 4@D, you may as well use your entry in spades to take a finesse in diamonds, hoping to pick up a doubleton diamond king; or if not doubleton,  then you could play @DQ, @DA and a small diamond, hoping for a favorable division of the outstanding diamonds.|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Apart from that - you might guess to lead a small heart to dummy, and if that works, to finesse the @h10.
That is the only way you can hope to lose just 1 heart, so you may as well try it...
That line happens to succeed, so taking the @D finesse and then playing the @h suit as recommended, you might luck out and make the contract.|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt||at|First, I count my potential losers, I have a sure club loser, so I need to hold my losers in diamonds and hearts to 2 tricks. 
When I turn out to have a diamond loser, I have no other choice but to try to hold the heart losers to 1 trick
Again, the only way I can do it is to find the @HJ with west, and the @HA with East. That is the only way..|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: You should, as declarer, make sure to count your potential losers and then form a plan to restrict your losers to the number you can afford to make the contract
I may interrupt play to ask you these kinds of questions -- OK??|

mitche: bidding: .. first, on behalf of BBO, I want to apologize for the Weird, Wacky, Wonderfully Woeful
random-number generator that has given us these wild hands :) :)
So West bid 4@s in third seat. That seems perfectly reasonable, and it keeps N from bidding, in case he had a good hand but not great distribution.
The general rule of thumb for preempting: subtract 4 from the length of your suit.  
The difference is the level you should think about preempting, assuming you meet other preempt requirements

up|25|pf|y|at|mitche: OK - on to the play
N led a small diamond - if N wants to lead a diamond, the 10 is the correct card, since it's the highest card in a 3-consecutive-card sequence (the 10 9 8)
It might work out to lead the singleton @HJ
and I admit, that would be my first choice.
If I am lucky, I score the heart, a ruff, and the club and diamond aces -- except the diamond ace doesn't cash|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Please let me refer you to Eddie Kantar's books on defensive play. 
He provides a much better explanation than I could. 
The basic idea is that it's safer to lead from a sequence, because you are less likely to set up tricks for declarer|

at|mitche: bidding: 1@C and 1@h seem perfectly normal, and they are the correct bids.
Now for the lesson part -- an opening bid can be MINIMUM, showing a maximum of about 14 or 15 points (including distribution)
an INVITATIONAL opening bid is about a king better than a minimum, or 16-18 total points, and finally
a STRONG opener is 19 -21 points, or about 2 kings stronger than a minimum opener
right??|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: so when you open 1@C or 1@d and your partner bids a major for which you have 4 card support
With a MINIMUM opener, raise 1 level (to 2@h here). 
With an invitational opener, raise to the 3 level, and with a strong opener, raise to the 4 level
North's hand is worth about 15 points in support of hearts (those cruddy unsupported "quacks" are a minus)
So North's best bid is just 2@h|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Now we come to South's hand. After the supporting bid, S has 10 high card points, plus 1 point for the long suit (the fifth heart is a trick), and 1 more point for the doubleton, or about 12 total points at hearts. 
So 4@h is a bit aggressive, but I love it! 
So this auction, as given, is just what it should have been|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Notice that the auction 
1@C - 1@H/ 4@h is NOT a shutout or closeout bid. Opener has 20 points, and responder can look for slam with an appropriate hand, worth 13+ total points

up|43|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: When the opponents bid strongly to game, as happened here, you should give strong thought to the defense you are going to play:  
First: try to figure out how many points your partner has. 
In West's case, he sees just 7 HCP and can figure her partner has 4-7 points. 
If NS had a minimum 25 or so points for game, then EW have 15 points, and W has 7 of them 
leaving 8 for E.|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: If NS are close to slam, E might have just 4.. 
Next, once you get an idea of how strong your pard's hand is, you should try to figure out what you can about his distribution
In this case, W has not much help, because the auction was pretty uninformative
In any case, W can figure that NS will have relatively little trouble setting up their suits if we just defend passively. 
The club holding for West is very discouraging. N bid clubs, and the @CQ looks to be poorly placed for the defense.|
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Based on that, West should think, "I should try to set up tricks for us before declarer has a chance to set hers up"
Where can West hope to develop tricks? Spades. That is it. So W should lead the @SK
Next: When N led clubs from dummy at trick 3 - East should play small, why?|
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: 
a) it is pretty unlikely that South has the singleton club king. If she does, you aren't beating
the hand anyway
b) Declarer is likely to have a guess in clubs. When you play the ace, declarer no longer has to guess.
And if you do win the A, your correct play is to lead the @SJ, why?|
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: If pard has the K without the queen, the J will set up a spade trick for you immediately. 
If pard had the queen without the king, you set up a spade later on 
And if declarer has the @SKQ, you aren't beating the hand no matter what you do |
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: And now a comment on declarer's play: 
When the diamond play worked, you can discard a losing CLUB from dummy, instead of the spade
Notice that you can always trump spade losers in your hand, but with 3 opposite 3 clubs, you
cannot ruff the losing club. Therefore you should consider discarding from the suit with the same # of cards in each hand
Declarer cannot work for ruffs when both declarer and dummy have the same # of cards in a suit
Thanks to the first group of players. Please leave your seats and allow the next group of people
to come in.|

So she has to be content with a simple 2@h overcall.
Also, the @h suit isn't quite strong enough for her to double and then bid 2@h, which should show a good 17+ points
3@s is a nice bid with the S hand. It is a preemptive raise. 
S should bid 2@s with the same kind of hand he should raise 1@s to 2@s|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: But this isn't that kind of hand - he has a lot of distributional strength and weak hand. 
So he bids 3@s which is by agreement, a weak hand.
How does S show a good hand over the 2@h bid?|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


nt||at| 
If S bids a new suit, that is forcing and promises 10 HCP or thereabouts
If S has a good hand with spade support, he would have bid 3@h -- an immediate cue bid is a "limit  raise or better" in most standard bidding systems, including both SA and 2 over 1
West's 4@h is a bit aggressive. East could have bid 2@h without the @DKJ, for instance
But on balance, it pays to be a bit aggressive.|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: N took his life in his hands with 4@s - 
I guess she took the 3@s bid to show a stronger hand.
But this is an important point: after opener's LHO bids anything, a jump raise to the 3 level is
preemptive!!!
anniebmisc: no, took it for LOTT, but felt they could make 4 hearts, down 1 or even 2 not doubled better than 620
mitche: Yes, Ann, this is true, but you might also get hammered. South's hand is very, very unusual, with
2 singletons.|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: And that leads me to the 5 heart bid. 
I'd have been doubling 4@s and regretting it.
kat827:  Would it be ok for E to overcall 1NT?
mitche: No, east needs a spade stopper to overcall 1NT . You might not have another suit stopped but when you overcall 1@S with 1NT, you guarantee a spade  stopper

sk||at|mitche: bidding:
a) with 7 hearts, I would open 3@h and not 2@h -- we discussed that earlier (subtract 4 from your suit length ..)
b) I think the S hand is better suited to a double (sorry 'bout that) than a NT overcall
Reason: S would love to find 4-4 spade fit, but 2NT makes that very hard|
pg| ***** 112 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: When you preempt, you should look at suit length and apply the rule of 2 and 3
That says, vulnerable, you should be able to go down not more than 2, non-vul, at most 3 assuming  an average dummy

c) North should pass 2NT with her balanced hand - 3@d should be based on at least a 5 card suit...|
pg| ***** 113 ***** |


nt||at|
Now, - someone asked if 3@d was a transfer. 
Please notice that 3@d is asking the NT bidder to transfer into hearts, the suit East has 6 of
So it makes no sense to use 3@d as a transfer. 
You may make up some meaning for the transfer, but whatever you do agree on, it cannot be looking to play hearts
So I expect 3@d to show long, weak diamonds|
pg| ***** 114 ***** |


nt||at|
BILAsst10: But systems are on?
mitche: A number of you want to know if systems are on. I think that the only bid that should be on is a
transfer into the unbid major
If the bid was a weak 2@d, then 3@c might be stayman, and transfers on, but otherwise, no.. 
If you use Lebensohl, then a cue bid should be Stayman for the other major... 
But that isn't appropriate for us to use at this level of our bridge development, I think

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: If East has 6 hearts, which is what 2@H usually promises, 
how many hearts should S expect West to have?
South should expect West to hold 2.|
pg| ***** 130 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: good. Now West is certain to have at least 1 ace, because East preempted. 
If East has a good 6 card suit and 2 aces, she is going to open 1@h
East is very likely to have the @hK, not west. 
If west had that card, it would have been the opening lead
All of this means "WEST Is going to get the lead"|
pg| ***** 131 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: And declarer should dread a second heart lead through the @HQ
So what should declarer do? 
She should allow East to win the first heart. 
Then, if East continues hearts, west will not have one to return when she gets in with her aces
This is called a "hold-up" play. No, it's not what a robber does to you -- it is withholding your
stopper until you have removed an unsafe lead from the "danger hand"|
pg| ***** 132 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: Declarer is hoping that East doesn't have any aces at with her hold-up 
because the contract can't ever be made if she does
West made a very nice defensive play in diamonds -- she held up her ace until she got the lead in  clubs and then set up her long diamond .. Nice defense
BILAsst10: If south ducks what does E play at the 2nd trick?
mitche: If East is allowed to win the first heart, she should have led spades. Reasoning  is that since S
did not double, West is marked with spade length|

mb|ppp|sk||at|mitche: bidding: You may have heard this before: when you have a misfit, get out low 
West's 2@h rebid says "6 hearts and a minimum hand"
OK - with that understanding, East may decide her best action is also to pass. 
The minimum 2@h rebid tells her that game is very unlikely, so 2@h may be the last chance for a positive score...|
pg| ***** 144 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Even with 9 points, the hand rates to be a misfit and looking for a fit at the 3 level is asking for trouble
So here is the point: Even with 9 or a bad 10 points, you should be very slow to get to the 3 level on a misfit|
pg| ***** 145 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Now, should West have bid 2@h?
When East bid 1@s, West's @SAQ became very useful cards, fitting with partner's suit
So even with 13 points, the outside singleton and now-useful @SQ, I would bid 2@c
Doesn't matter that East might have just 4 spades. The @SAQ are going to help more than, say the @DAQ|
pg| ***** 146 ***** |


nt||at|
High cards in partner's suit are usually more useful than in a side suit
If W bids 2@C, E will raise, and then W can bid 3@h to show his pattern,
West would now bid 3@S, and the final contract would be 4@s, which has the advantage of making..

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: In 3@c, S knows that W has 6 hearts (from the 2@h rebid). 
It's generally a bad idea to lead a suit that has been rebid by the opponents, since they are probably going to try to use it.
I’d lead a trump here... because I know that the opponents' hearts will be difficult to establish. 
Also, S can guess that East has at most 1 heart - if she held 2 hearts, 
then she would have passed 2@h or raised to 3@h

nt||at|mitche: Declarer play: Declarer could have made the contract. 
She could have ruffed one heart, and then when the suit did not divide 3-3, she plays another heart and discards a losing  diamond, This "loser on Loser" play (at trick 9, I think) 
This makes dummy's heart high. Use spades to get to dummy. 
Declarer won 3 spades, but alas, the suit split 3-3
She did not allow herself to do it.|
pg| ***** 163 ***** |


nt||at|BILAsst10:  needed to unblock the @S then has plenty of @S tricks
mitche: Eileen pointed out that declarer could also have set up spades by playing off the @SAQ to unblock the suit, and when they split 3-3, she is home.
All right .. that should do it for this evening. Apologies for yakking so much... but there were many key points to be made...|
