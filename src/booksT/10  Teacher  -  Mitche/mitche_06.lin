^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
He’s been mentoring in BIL for 2 years and lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

He learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|

^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play.

mitche: Hi, everyone and welcome to tonight's 2 over 1 play and discuss session. Please play 2 over 1 (2/1 by an unpassed hand is GF and 1NT forcing) with standard carding, so we all are on the same page. 
You are all bidding 2 over 1 with these conventions: fourth suit forcing and new minor forcing, ...Have fun and pick up some bridge tips! Let's see what happens :)|

mitche: bidding:Some people at matchpoints would routinely open 3@h with N hand, but I do not like the bid with that hand
here is why: 7222 is a terrible hand pattern. 
N has an 8 loser hand and could conceivably wind up going down 800
The black-suit queens are unsupported, so while the @H suit is minimally OK for the preempt, the shape is NOT|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||at|Better would be something like x, QJ109xxx, xx, QJx, which has one point less, but rates to play a trick or 2 better 
I use the rule of 2 and 3 (down 2 with equal vulnerability, down 3 with favorable)
At matchpoints, if I am feeling frisky or need to generate a swing, I may do it with a hand like this, but if I do, I had better be ready to apologize to pard|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Now, East has a genuine problem over 3@H.. Double is just wrong. 
No spade support   3N is for play, so that is wrong.  The club suit is too ratty to bid 4@C
But should East pass?|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||at|gypsy1308: I was wishing N had opened 2 so then I could do UNT
mitche: if N opened 2@H, 2NT is natural, 16 points, give or take, and a heart stopper, NOT unusual.
So East has to decide between pass, 4@C 4@D  or 4NT
Anything could work, but I think I bid 4@D and hope
Only problems with 4NT are:|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||at| 
a) what happens when your pard has good spades? and 
b) will he take it as minors? Blackwood???
FM75:  Can't be blackwood, as I play it, with no suit agreement => minors.
mitche: If there is a chance for pard to misinterpret my bid, I will try to find one that is maybe less ideal, but more understandable. 
4@D, planning to bid 5@C later, if I need to, is unambiguous|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: But as I say, anything might work. 
After 3@S by Fred, East has a raise to 4, so passing worked well here...
FM75:  over 4@D I think I have to bid @S at least I know we have majority of honors|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||at| 
mitche: yes... East may risk passing (Kx and a void looks OK for a dummy)
So EW get to 4@S, which is a decent contract
Preempts work - even ones like N had :)|

Mitche: Play: Fred was right to discard on first heart lead, 
but S would do better to win the @HA and then to play a trump
The reason for this is two-fold
First, declarer gets just 1 heart ruff in... second, if declarer wants to take a ruffing finesse in diamonds, the trump shift removes an entry to dummy|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: S knows that the @CK is not a winner for declarer, so she can kill dummy by making it ruff
Finally, when N got her second @D ruff in, she needs to play a club (the heart gave ops a ruff-sluff, allowing declarer to make)
How does N know not to lead a heart?|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: She has seen all the outstanding hearts played, so she knows that West's hand is void in hearts and he will be able to discard a loser when he ruffs in dummy
All of you need to count cards and high card points. I recommend reading Mike Lawrence's book on counting. It is excellent and easy to understand
I think that is a very good book... it goes into card-placing exercises.. |

mitche: bidding: After 2@C, what should W do?
FM75:  need to make a forcing bid
mitche: 3@S should probably say "bid 3N with spades under control", 
But I think W's best bid would have been 2@S
Why?|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: 
a) if pard has 3 hearts, W will find out about it.
b) East can still bid over 2@S economically (2 or 3 notrump?)
c) West can then bid 4@C to say, "huge hand in support of clubs"
If W does bid 3@S, he should remove 3N to 4@C, I think
Then, EW may get to the club slam|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


nt||at|azin: 4@C after 3NT could be a Gerber?
mitche: The point here is that W has a hand worth about 19 points in support of clubs
If Clubs is bid naturally, I think the @C bid should be natural here. 
I do not like Gerber, It is a baby food.|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt||at|FM75:  How do I know P is not 3244 or 2344?
mitche: If pard is 44 in the minors, she would have preferred to open 1N with a good hand
And after 1@s overcall, she passes with minimum opener and flat shape
FM75:  ok - and would not have bid 3N probably?
gypsy1308: I wondered if I could have bid 1NT over the 1@S, thought I was a bit strong for that|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: I would not like bidding NT with void in pard's suit. West could have had the same shape minus the @DK and @HK
gypsy1308: yes better to have a couple of @H's 
mitche: So the 2@C bid (inferentially) says she has good distribution or above-minimum strength
2@C was a fine bid
kw2012:  How should the auction have proceeded to reach slam
mitche: one possible route there: after 2@c - 4@c / 4@d and you are off to the races|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt||at|azin: I like to re-word my question. How can West ask for aces after the 3NT? 
Bid 4NT which could be a quantitative? To some not so smart
FM75:  how about 4@S over 2@C?|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Because Blackwood is so expensive when clubs or diamonds is your suit, some pairs use "minorwood" or "kickback" 
With minorwood, a jump to 4 of your agreed on minor is a substitute for Blackwood
"Kickback" - the next suit over your agreed on minor (or @H, for that matter), is a BW substitute.|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


nt||at|gypsy1308: So over 2@C  4@C is minorwood asking for A?
mitche: But I caution you not to use these without a lot of discussion, because they are NOT standard bidding conventions, and not for casual partnerships
You can get terribly confused wondering if 4@D, for example, were kickback or naturally rebid @D suit.. but after the jump to 4@C, It's pretty clearly a control bid|

at|mitche: Play: when you are defender, it's a good idea to try to win a trick with the cheapest of equivalent honors
So when S led the @S10, N should have played the @SQ, not the K.
This helps your partner figure out where the missing high cards are located...
And declarer could try this line: win the spade ace at trick 1, diamond to the king, and then run the @D10.|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


nt||at| 
mitche: Reason: Even if the finesse loses, the @SJ is protected, and you still make 11 tricks. But if the @D finess works, you take all 13 tricks
gypsy1308: With @sK coming up I feared S might hold Q and I could lose heaps, that is why I ducked
FM75:  North would not have had enough to over call missing the Q

at|mitche: bidding: What did 2@C mean?
The raise of 1@C to 2@C says "NO MAJOR SUIT" A raise of 1@C or 1@D to 2 is the bid of last resort, so to speak
So S's bid of 2@C alerts  N to the fact that there is no 4-4- major fit.
You all need to remember that . It is important and it'll save you a lot of grief. 
No matter whether you play standard or "inverted" minor raises, an immediate raise of 1 of a minor denies a 4 card major. Period.|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: North, then, should just pass 2@C. 
If you agree that 2@C denies a major, then 2@H is best treated as a hand that wants to find a NT game, In other words, 2@H should show a stopper and game interest.
N has the stopper, all right, but the hand isn't quite good enough to make a move toward game|

mitche: Play: West's Opening Lead was the @H2.
This card won't help the defense nearly as much as the @HJ, but the best idea is to lead the @CQ  
BILAsst10: Isn't that taking a chance in sitting up declarer's @C's?
mitche: When Nature deals you a 3 card sequence, lead it. Yes, they bid clubs, but you don't want to pick off an unsupported honor in partner's hand.|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


nt||at|
An alternative is to lead a small @s at trick 1, since East is marked with some length in the suit 
Since S doesn’t have 4 spades (remember 2@C?) and N didn't open 1@S, the odds are really good that East has at least 4 spades|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: When west got in, he led a club, the 3. 
Declarer played the @CAce from dummy. Better is to play small, hoping that East will be forced to play a high club, in which case, you can establish the suit with just 1 loser... 
And if E plays small, then you can win a cheap trick and still lose just 1 club|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: Finally, declarer should hope for EW to play diamonds first. When you have a suit like Jxx opposite Qxx (or thereabouts), your best hope is to make the other guys lead that suit for you
Doesn't matter if you are declarer or defender. A suit like diamonds here is "frozen"
Whichever side is forced to break the suit gives up a trick.|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


nt||at|masse24: Trick 2....@H return. @H3 best, rather than the @H9.
mitche: The best thing, when W led the @H2 is for declarer to play small from dummy. 
East may guess to put in the @H9, but I would bet a lot of people would play the K
Declarer should go after clubs first, I think. She has a 5 card suit and 8 of them. She may be able to win 4 clubs....|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: and in so doing, force the defenders to make some discards...
spades will produce 3 tricks eventually.. 
Even if you do guess to play the @H9, you have to shift to something else.. and your hand would play a diamond...OK -- time to change places. Thanks to the first group of players for their contribution and willingness to allow me to comment on their play. |

up|40|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: The standard lead from KJ10x is the J; but a lot of people use "coded”
10's and 9's where the opening lead of the J of a suit denies a higher honor, 
and the 10 or 9 promises 0 or 2 cards higher
Including the one immediately above the card you led. So the 10 is correct in this style from AJ10 or KJ10 in a suit
With QJ10, you lead the Q (of course .. top of a sequence)
I recommend that you learn coded 10's and 9's opening leads for NT contracts.|
pg| ***** 117 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: That said, S played the 2 on the first trick. Play the 3. 
It may not seem to matter, but an astute partner will notice  that the 2 is missing and may work out that the 3 was encouraging.
kyno40: I like count
mitche: Klaus, lest I forget, that was a very nice job of reading the club suit :)
It is usually more helpful to get attitude on honor leads rather than count
kyno40: the 2 told me odd # so it was easy|
pg| ***** 118 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: But in play --- when declarer gets in, she has to decide which suit to go after, I would guess to lead a small diamond and duck it completely. 
If you are lucky enough to find the suit 3/3 or a doubleton honor-10, you may make an extra trick in the suit
Well, there was one other clue in the @C suit. when declarer did not win the @CQ at trick 1, you were pretty sure  to find it in partner's hand :)|

mitche: bidding: Even with 21 HCP, W should open 1@S, not 2@C
Why?
a) the hand has 2 suits which may be decent trump suits
b) if East cannot bid over 1@S, then you do not want to be in game (or even the 3 level), so 2@C gets you too high to often
c) The hand has 4 1/2 losers - we like to have 4 loser or better hands for 2@C openers
So W should plan to open 1@S and then rebid 3@D|
pg| ***** 131 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Either 4@S or 5@D is making, as the cards lie, but a 5-3 club division sinks 3NT
After 2@S, what does 2NT mean?
BILAsst10: balanced hand - does not have 3@S
mitche: It shows a hand with about 8-10 HCP. So East is too weak to make that bid.
(m.m. question: If East had that hand, would she not bid it directly after 2@c, so this implies weaker?)
MargoD:  I didn't think I could bid my @D again and thought I had no other bid 
mitche: 3@D is perfect for the E hand after 2@S - you have a 5 card suit, your hand has a K (and 2 Q's)

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: When declarer receives a heart lead, she has 5 diamonds, and 3 each in @H and @S
She should cash her winners in this order - 2 hearts, the @DAKJ
Then a 4th diamond to the @DQ and a 5th diamond. Cash High cards from Short suit first, to avoid blocking the suit. Then, heart, then @SQ
Then up to the @SA and K
If the spades break 3-3 you take all 13 tricks... Or, if someone carelessly pitches a spade from a 4-card holding, you also take all the tricks|
pg| ***** 147 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: BTW, 4@S is cold. 
If the defense fails to lead a club, declarer plays 3 rounds of spades and hearts, discarding a club.  

If the defense leads clubs, declarer plays 3 rounds of trump and then switches to diamonds. The defense gets just the other trump, you are still OK, because they split 4-4|
pg| ***** 148 ***** |


nt||at|Kibbies make a point:
4@s is not cold on a club lead if you can find: @cAce and a small club to K
@d ruff + @sJ = -1 (underleading the @cAce for -2 seems fiction)

sk||at|mitche: bidding: Marty Bergen has a term, "the magic of voids"
When you have a void in the opponents' suit, your hand is a lot more valuable than its HCP suggests.
Here is why. 
East raised spades. So EW have at least 9 spades between them. 
So declarer will be able to ruff diamonds - lots of them, and unless she is really unlucky, she will still have trump control.|
pg| ***** 158 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Second, when the opps bid and raise diamonds with your void, all your side's points are outside that suit. You are playing with a "30 point deck", so to speak 
So you need far fewer points to make game - in this case, EW were cold for 4@S with just 19 points
After the raise to 2@s, I evaluate W as holding a hand worth 12 HCP plus 6 distribution points (one for each of the 5th and 6th spade, plus 4 for the @D void)
clearly enough for game... |

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: west, the simplest plan is best here: just play the @SK and if the trumps are not 4-0, you finish pulling them
Then you knock out the @CA and take the @H finesse last
You do not want to risk an adverse ruff by messing around with the side suits.
If the trumps are 4-0, you can finesse against the @S10 and still take 10 tricks|
pg| ***** 174 ***** |


nt||at|Jane01:  'adverse ruff'??
mitche: adverse ruff? Suppose hearts are 5-2. Someone ruffs the third round of the suit. 
kyno40: if 4@S is bid should I bid 5@D ? 
mitche: The 5@D bid would be great, but S might be the one to bid it (singleton spade, 6th @D). 
OK - next week is our last game before Christmas -- everyone please bring a covered dish and let's party!!!|
