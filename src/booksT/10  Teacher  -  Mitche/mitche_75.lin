fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
First, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."
Mitch Edelman aka mitche 


MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.
Thank you Eileen (wyoming33) for sending the hands and editing the chatlog! @h

East can use the rule of 11 to deduce that South has zero cards higher than the 7. 
So what should East do at trick 2? |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


at|
Return a diamond.  This sets up West's suit for 3 tricks.
Declarer will always have 1 diamond trick, so setting up 2 extra winners seems like a good idea.
If South has any heart losers, they are not going to go away anywhere, 
so a heart switch isn’t likely to help the defense.
|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: The key here is declarer has not got any assets in dummy on which to discard potential @h cards.
Declarer after trick 1 has 6 tricks (2 spades, 3 hearts, and a diamond --well, maybe a @D).
Where might the 7th trick come from?
If either Major is friendly (3-3 split or maybe a friendly spade honor.. the 7th trick is there).
But notice that if the hearts are 3-3 to begin with, declarer always has 4 hearts, so there isn’t any hurry to cash them.
If the hearts are NOT 3-3, then cashing the @HAKQ sets up a trick for the defenders.
|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Even if the spades are 3-3, the declarer MUST lose one.
The @sAK won't set up the suit unless the @SQJ are doubleton, and that's not at all likely.
So before touching hearts, duck a spade completely.  Just play small from both hands.
If they're 3-3 declarer might make the hand 
(the defense will need to get 4 club tricks because they did not set up diamonds immediately).
It turns out that the spades aren’t working, so Tom is not making the hand, 
but at least he gives himself the best chance.
|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Many years ago, I heard the difference between a good and a bad declarer.  
Want to know what it was? |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


at|
They're both playing a 3NT contract. The good declarer loses 4 tricks early.  The bad declarer loses 
5 tricks late.  Marty Bergen, in his books on declarer play says "Lose your sure losers early."

|at|mitche: Bidding:  East opens with 1@c.  Everyone OK with that bid?
The hand is a "bergen 20" (exactly), so 1@C is reasonable. 
I would also consider (and in third seat would definitely bid) 3@c.

But 1@c is perfectly OK.  And 1@h seems right, too.
West is pretty weak, so pass is a good idea. While the shape is right for a negative X, the hand is too weak.
Give West the @SJ1094 instead of the @s10943, and I would negatively X.

|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  So what did North mean with 2@c?|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


at|
Ima Card:  Cue bid 4-card support limit raise.
mitche:  An immediate cue bid by advancer (overcaller's partner) means 4+ of overcaller's bid suit (@h here) 
and at least 10 dummy points.  Which is just what North has.
The overcaller (South) is now obligated to describe his hand further.
A rebid of 2@h (the overcalled suit) says "I have less than a full opener, counting up distribution points".
|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: ANY OTHER BID promises 13+ points after reevaluating hand for shortness and extra length.
So South has 11 HCP plus a worthless @CJ, and an extra point for the 5th heart and an extra couple 
of points for the singleton.   
So he bid 2@d. 

Now North looks at his 13 HCP, fitting @D cards and says, "an opening hand opposite an opening hand = game." 
So North bids 4@h.
|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt||at|BILAsst10: What would North bid with 3-card support?
mitche:  Depends on the rest of the hand.  So let's change the @h2 to a spade. 
I'd just bid some number of NT. 
Also, please note that the immediate cue bid of 2@c, being forcing, allows North to bid his hand differently 
without good heart support.
|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Suppose North has something like KQxx, xx, AJx, K10xx
Now he bids 2@C and then bids NT next.   It is 1 round force, so advancer can bid a new suit or NT after the 
cue bid  -- With the sample hand I provided, not the actual one.

A new suit by advancer is usually treated as "non-forcing, constructive" meaning some tolerance for 
overcaller's suit, about 8-10 points, and a 5+ card suit of your own.
|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Since most overcalls are 1-suited hands, bidding your own suit is better used that way--to use the cue bid 
followed by your own suit to show game values (or very close to it) and a good suit.
If you have a poor hand with an outside suit, e.g. xxx, xx, KQxxx, Kxx -- pass.
Remember the rule of holes?
Noah121:  If you find yourself in one, stop digging!
mitche:  If you’re on a misfit, get out low!!!

at|mitche: Play: East made a deceptive play at trick 2, by leading a low club, rather than trying to cash the @CA.
I guess she was hoping that South had the only outstanding club.   Or that declarer might ruff high to 
promote a trump for West.
Declarer should ruff with the 10 or higher, because if West began with a singleton, then he will overruff 
the pygmy trump with which he ruffed at trick 2.
(MM: As west would not have underlead the Ace...it should be in east..therefore declarer should not ruff at all?)
|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  And as another minor point (that will save you some grief), it would be better for declarer to play the @HQ 
rather than leading toward the king.
Reason:  You preserve the high heart in dummy so you can overrruff a diamond should play proceed that way.

at|mitch:  Play:  This is kind of an interesting hand, since 6@s is cold, 6@h is not, and I can't think 
of a standard bidding system that allows you to find the spade fit.   (6@h fails if East plays @SA and a 
second spade, ruffed).  Once East leads a club, the hand is over.
If your partner would recognize 4@D as a splinter, you might have bid it, 
but with 4 dead spades, I like the 4@h bid.

at|mitche: Bidding: I admit that I would have bid 2@d instead of 1NT, because I have a 6-card suit and 
only a singleton heart.
The final contract would be the same as East would bid 2@s over 2@d, and now West would bid no trump, I think.

Note that E's 2@s bid is an "impossible bid", as West denied 4 spades with 1NT.
So what should the 2@s bid mean?
|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


nt||at|It shows
a) game-forcing; 
b) a spade stopper;  
c) should also promise 5 hearts or more.

In one of my expert partnerships, the 2@S bid here would show a hand too good for a new minor forcing 2@C.
If after 3@d, East rebid 3@s it would show 5-6 in the majors.
|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |

at|mitche: Play:  As East advertised strong spades, North may as well look somewhere else for her lead, 
and I'd go after the unbid suit here.
Reasons: North has not got a suit of her own to set up, and South may have clubs, since E/W didn’t bid them.

As it happens a club lead will make 3NT very hard for declarer.
She will have to finesse in diamonds to make the hand.
And even then, if the diamond length is with South, the hand will become too hard to manage.

|sk||

at|mitche:  Bidding:  After pass, pass, 1@S, 2@h, what should North do?
She has a pretty fair hand, given her pass. And support for both minors.
I would opt to double 2@h, a negative X. 
If North does double 2@h, East should raise hearts. 

In fact, east should raise hearts even after the pass.
Raising an overcall can be made on a very weak hand with good support.
|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: I wouldn’t even object to East bidding 4@h over the pass, and certainly over a negative X.
Noah121:  Particularly since E/W are not vulnerable?

mitche:  Yes, four hearts.  West has to have at least 5 hearts to bid 2@h, yes?
So E/W have at least 10 hearts. and N/S will not have enough trumps to double.
So you may play 4@h undoubled while N/S are making 5@s -- which they do.
rattray:  How would we have gotten to spades?
|
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  After a negative X, you rebid spades and partner raises to 4.
Rebidding spades strongly suggests 6 of them.  Otherwise you can bid a minor with 5 spades and 4 of the minor 
(over the presumed negative X).

Or bid NT with a heart card and only 5 spades.  In a pinch, you might bid 3 of a minor with only 3 of them.
No, 3@s isn’t forcing, but you would show extra values with the bid. 
Assuming the auction went like this: 1@s (2@h) X (3@h)/ 3@s.
|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  If East blasts to 4@h over the neg X, then you have a harder time.

First lesson:  North has enough to bid, and the neg X says "minors", the 2 unbid suits.

Second lesson:  East, with lots of hearts and not a lot of points, should raise - it is a preemptive bid, 
since with a good hand, East would cue bid spades.
East would like better shape, a singleton perhaps, but at this vulnerability 4@h is a good idea.

at|mitche:  Play:  North decided to lead a @D, (good choice), but she led the @DJ.  
From a sequence, lead the top card in the sequence (the K). 
And when that holds, your second card should be the @dJ. The @dK promises the @dQ, so partner will not 
be confused. 

If you don’t follow that sequence, pard will put the @DJ in declarer’s hand.

pg| ***** 100 ***** |


nt||at|As it is, the @DJ wound up forcing third hand to win the @DA and made a winner out of the
@D10 which absorbed declarer's club loser.

MM:  By clicking on the cards, you can play the hand Double Dummy, 

please click the  ^$40 for the next board |

at|mitche:  Bidding:  Since the 1NT rebid by East limits her hand to 14 HCP (most of the time)
(with more she opens 1NT)
 2@h by West was okay, even though her hand has limit raise strength.
West knows that the maximum strength for her side is 24 HCP, so game would be a stretch.
And if you need the perfect maximum for game to make, don’t bid it.
Mike Lawrence, one of the greatest players in history, once (maybe more than once) said, 
"don’t count on me having the perfect maximum. I never do."
|
pg| ***** 103 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  So 2@h was fine.
At IMPS scoring, I would expect the bidding to die at 2@h.
rattray:  Should West let pard know she has fit in hearts first?
mitche:  Good question. I like 1@s.  East could have 4 spades, so why not?
If East has 4-5 shape in the Majors, spades will play at least 1 and maybe 2 tricks better than hearts.
So why not look for a 4-5 fit?  It doesn’t cost anything.  
So 1@S was OK.
|
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  East may believe she is in 5-2 fit but dummy will be a happy sight.
I mentioned that at IMPS the bidding should end w/2@h.  At matchpoints, an enterprising South might 
bid 2NT (unusual, can't possibly be a desire to play NT).  And N/S would find 3@d.  E/W might sell out at 3@d 
(getting a poorer result than 2@h) or bid 3@h and go down.  So if you're a matchpoint player, think 
about balancing with 2NT here. It's crazy at any other form of scoring, and mildly nutty, even at matchpoints.|
pg| ***** 105 ***** |


nt||at|rattray:  To play un2nt thought I needed 5-5.
mitche:  Not balancing. But it is very, very aggressive!  
You have to play the spots off the cards to survive bidding 2NT, which is why I say it's mildly nutty to do so 
- some of my friends would say it's very nutty--ah, but what do they know anyway?  What do I know anyway?

at|mitche: Play: At a suit contract, leading the @CQ is OK  (at NT lead low from QJxx).

Declarer now counts her losers - a spade, 2 clubs, and 3 diamonds in hand.
|
pg| ***** 120 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  To make the contract, she should lead a DIAMOND from dummy at trick 2 and when she regains the lead, 
another DIAMOND so she can ruff the third one in dummy.
Should North play the @DA second seat? We shall see. 
Anyway, declarer should play diamonds before pulling trumps. 
That third diamond isn't going away!
Here's what happened. Declarer played her trumps first and then played her @DJ from dummy, losing to the King.
|
pg| ***** 121 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  The defense then cashed 2 clubs with North winning the @CK.  Now North can get out with a spade.
If she does, declarer will win the @SA and lead a second spade, the defense can play either a winning 
club or a winning spade, forcing declarer to ruff.
Now, declarer will have to lead away from the @DQ -- down 1.
How can North know to lead a spade, not her @DA?
Any ideas?
|
pg| ***** 122 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  If declarer has the @SAQ, would not she have finessed?
But declarer can’t have both the top spade honors.
So South MUST have either the @sA or the @sQ.

|
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  So a small spade is 100% safe.
And Eileen's point is 100% correct, too. 
South won the @DK, so this means declarer must have the @dQ  
(South would have won with the lowest of equals).
And if perchance South did have the @sQ, North would have to lead a spade.|
pg| ***** 124 ***** |

mitche: All right let me first thank Eileen for her generous assistance and all of you for your courteous attention and questions.  

MM: You can play the hand Double Dummy if you wish
