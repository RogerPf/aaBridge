fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."
Mitch Edelman aka mitche 


MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.
Thank you Eileen (wyoming33) for sending the hands and editing the chatlog! @h

pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|mitche:  Bidding:  Playing 2 over 1, you should not open a 4-card Major in first or second seat -- EVER
East should hold her nose and open 1@C. 
If you have an agreement to open your better minor, then open 1@d but the standard treatment is:   
with 3-3 in the minors and no 5-card Major, open 1@C, 
with 4-4 in the minors and no 5-card Major, open 1@d.
Of course, if you have a balanced hand that meets your opening 1NT agreement, open 1NT. Even with a 5-card Major.
So East should open 1@C (or 1@D as noted above).
|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  South has 15 HCP, and stoppers in hearts, so 1NT makes sense as an overcall, 
showing a balanced 15-18 HCP.
West has 9 HCP. West knows that E/W have at least 21-22 HCP, right?
What does West know about North's hand, then?
West can add 21-22 and South's 15+ and come to the conclusion that North has at most 4 HCP.
Now, it is standard bidding (when your pard opens in first /second seat, and this is overcalled by 1NT), 
for responder (opener's partner) to double with 8+ HCP.
|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  What happens if West doubles?
The defense will take at least 7 tricks with proper defense and possibly 8.
If E/W make 2NT, then N/S is down 2, for 300 points.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|
Lesson: responder (in 3rd or 4th seat) doubles 1NT with 8+ HCP.   This is 100% standard, so you don’t need 
to discuss it with a knowledgeable partner -- And now you are all knowledgeable. :)
Here, what happens is that the NT overcaller, facing an entryless dummy, 
will be leading out of his hand every time he's in. 
|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So he leads away from his @cK and allows the defense to win 3 clubs, 3 diamonds, 
and if they shut out dummy, 2 hearts.   So it's not good to be stuck as South would be here.

at|mitche: Play: Opening lead was @SK, if you use @sA from @sAK (I hope you do) then @sK followed by @sA shows a 
doubleton.  
So what should he do at trick 3? --— lead a Diamond.
Which @D should south have led?   From almost a 3 card sequence, lead the top of the sequence--the Jack.
When he was in with his trump, South led a small club. 

Better for the defense for him to shift to a club rather than a @D, but looking only at the South and West 
hands, that is a very hard play to find.
|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  So the @d shift at trick 3 was probably correct, but when he led a club later on, he should lead the 10 so 
as to prevent declarer from winning a cheap trick

at|mitche:  Bidding:  Up to 1NT the bidding was fine.
North has a balanced 11 count with some nice fillers.  So 3NT is not an unreasonable bid.  
It's a bidder's game,
but if your bidding style allows you to open very light hands, then maybe 2NT would have been something
to think about.
At matchpoints, I frequently open 11 HCP hands with 2 1/2 quick tricks.
So make sure that your opening bidding style allows you to bid 3NT with hands like North.  
|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  In standard, or at IMPS, it's fine.  But if you open light --- don’t hang partner for a light opening bid.
jpadams52:  If you think you cannot get to game (3NT) then would it not be ok to stay in 1NT and make an 
overtrick if possible?
mitche:  Not with this North hand. South could have 14 HCP... so 3NT might be easy.  
North really must make a move.
Again, if you open sound, then 3NT is fine, If you open light in second seat, then 2NT might be worth thinking about.
(MM: 2NT with 11 HCP in a 4333 hand is quite enough?)

at|mitche: Play:  Now, on to the opening lead.
A) if N/S are playing "Walsh style", then 1@d almost surely denies a 4-card Major, right?
B) if N/S are NOT playing Walsh style, South's 1NT bid guarantees no 4-card Major, right?
So the chances are pretty good that E/W have length in one or both Majors.
With the West hand, leading dummy’s suit is not a great idea-- lead a Major.
With 2 non-touching honors in spades, the lead of a spade is risky, If it's wrong, it'll be very, very wrong.  
|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So lead a heart. 
Declarer will always win 2 hearts as the cards sit, so the lead gives away nothing.
Now, on to declarer play.
Declarer's club play was technically not the best.  He played a small club to the @cK. 
Better is to finesse against the @CQ.
The defense will always win 2 clubs, but then declarer can win 2 himself. 
|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Declarer misguessed the diamond suit. (which is kind of understandable).
After the 1@D bid, it's reasonable to expect that West didn’t lead from a 3 card suit.
And declarer should plan to win 2 hearts, 2 clubs, 2 spades, and either the spade finesse or a long diamond. 
kat827:  Is the finesse against the @CQ.....  4 over to the 9?
mitche:  yes
|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  BTW, now that I look at the cards, I think declarer can work out the @D situation.
Here is why.
When East returned the @d4, the 9 and J were "equals" and West could have played either. 
He was marked with the Jack, but if he had both the J and the 9, there was a chance he'd play the 9. 
In which case the suit was divided 3-3.
It is correct, by the way, for West to have played the @DJ there.
|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Counting and watching the spots might have led South to guessing right -- 
still, it's tempting to finesse against the 9.

at|mitche: Bidding:  How many hearts MUST south have to bid 2@H?|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


at|
WestElsdon:  5
mitche:  yes, and why?
gypsy1308: South would X with 4.
mitche:  Yes.
Since 2@h shows 5, North should support @H's and not re-bid @D.
|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Now, what should North do, knowing that south has 5 hearts 
(and should have at least 8-9 HCP, too)?
So North bids 3@h, not 3@D.|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


at|
mitche:  I want to point out that unless you use Romex doubles    (you probably don't), 
2@s shows a weak hand.  It's just a competitive bid, promising perhaps as many as 8 points.
With a better hand, West can make any of several stronger bids.
ecolodge:  When responder/advancer bids over interference, it does NOT mean 12+hcp?
|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  So East should know that West is bidding on not a lot.
Again, East has for a 3rd seat opener, around 11 or so HCP, and South's 2@h promises 8-9 minimum,
So if N/S are both on minimum hands, West might have 8 points.

But North freely bid 3@D over 2@s, so North has something above a minimum opener.
East can then reckon that West is weak, and the 3-level might be too expensive.
If East passes, so should South and West, and N/S will make 3@D most likely.
|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  If N/S had found hearts, they will make 4, I think.  
But the point is that East should pass 3@D.

at|mitch:  Play:   At trick 2, North led the @D8 for South to ruff.
She should lead the @DJ.  Why?
The @dJ will tell South to lead a heart, and that is just fine.
ecolodge:  Sorry, thought the high @D did the same thing.
mitche:  The 8 says "lead what you think is best" - but North has a strong preference for a heart, not a club.
ecolodge:  A lower @D would request a @C return, which is also something I wanted?
|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Well, the 8 is kind of hard to read, Laura.
For all of you -- make your signals as LOUD and clear as you possibly can. 
The @dJ is unambiguously calling for a @h.
Finally, late in play, South was in with the @CJ after a ruff.   He must lead a club.  
A heart gives declarer a ruff-sluff.

at|mitche:  Play:  South led a club. That was the suit bid on her left. 
A small @d is probably the "book" lead on this hand. 
When declarer's auction is real zippy, 1@c – 1@s/ 3@S – 4@S 
then they probably have enough power to make the contract if they're given time.
So as defender, you need to get busy against those power-packed auctions.
|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Occasionally you blow a trick, but you have to work to set your tricks up in your suits, 
not the ones that declarer’s side bid.

Play at trick 2 -- declarer finessed in diamonds. 
She is trying either to set up diamonds or to ruff them.
So when South wins the @DQ, the last card she should lead is another diamond.
|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Now, declarer had a better way to play the hand. 
It was, pull trumps, then cash club and diamond winners, ending in hand, then finally lead the heart.
Playing the Jack of hearts early in play was not best.
Also, South should play a small heart on the jack
Why?
If East had the @hQueen, the ace won’t go away.
|
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  If South plays small, then East is almost certain to finesse into the doubleton queen.
BTW, that is called a "chinese finesse", leading an unsupported honor toward another unsupported honor.

Over 3@d, West will double, most likely, or possibly bid 3NT if that is treated as unusual.
In any event, E/W won’t have a free ride to 3@C.
And South should bid 3@s over 3@c, by the way.
When you have 9 trumps, as South knows they do in spades, it's usually safe to bid to the 3 level 
(law of total tricks, if you are familiar with it).

nt||at|mitche:  Now, what should 2NT mean in this auction?
I think that it is best to treat it as unusual, for the 2 lower unbid suits.

Remember the discussion about doubling 1NT from earlier this evening?
Suppose West has a strong 1NT hand. Then, since N/S have already shown around 20 points in the bidding, 
What would East be left with?
Nothing much.
|
pg| ***** 99 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  And we saw the effect of doubling 1NT when dummy would be broke.
But 2NT is that much more likely to go for a large number. 
So it makes sense to use 2NT as unusual here.
ecolodge:  ok.  So if the auction went as bid, North should X 2NT?
mitche:  Good, that's our second lesson on NT overcalls tonight.

at|mitche: Play:  Anyway, we found ourselves in 3@C with a spade lead.
How should declarer play?
It looks right to use the trumps in the "short hand" (the one with fewer trumps) to ruff out losers 
in the other hand.
Here, East should win the opening lead, play @DAce and ruff a diamond, then give up a heart.
If the defense returns anything other than a trump, declarer can ruff 3 diamonds and make 5.
|
pg| ***** 112 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Of course, the defense should have no problems finding trump shift at that point.

at|mitche: Bidding:  I am not sure that 2@s should have meant "limit raise in hearts."
Especially as East is a passed hand.
I don’t know if there is a better use for the bid, either. 
(MM: With 2 possible cues (@d and @s) a @d-cue could mean 3-card limit raise, and a @s-cue a 4-card limit raise?)

My preference is to use Romex double to show a high honor.
Anyway, West decided to bid 4@h, which is an overbid vulnerable opposite a passed partner.

|
pg| ***** 116 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  The @SK rates to be a wasted value, and being vulnerable, it's entirely conceivable 
that E/W will be doubled, down 2, which would be a disaster at any form of scoring.
The fact that declarer has all 3 missing key cards (@SK, @CK, @DK) offside, a 1 in 8 chance, is the 
only reason that 4@s fails to make.
And if any one of them is right for declarer, 4@h will fail.
don:   Should West bid 3@H at her first bid?
|
pg| ***** 117 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  2@h would be fine, 3@h is OK non-vulnerable, and maybe even here.  
Some people play that a preemptive jump overcall denies any outside Ace or King, 
but here, vulnerable, that is too restrictive.
I would bid 2@h -- even with 7 of them.
kat827:  I thought that a jump overcall is weak, e.g. 0-5 points, so better to bid 1@H.
mitche:  With East a passed hand, you probably do not have a game, Kate, so the preemptive overcall is 
a) safe and
b) possibly disruptive enough to make it too difficult for N/S to find their best contract.
|
pg| ***** 118 ***** |


nt||at|realrowdy:  Can you use Bergen count when thinking about a preempt?
mitche:  I don’t think that is productive.. Better to use losing trick count.
Or "playing tricks" if you prefer that terminology.  LTC and playing tricks will get you to the same result,
namely a guess of how many tricks you are going to take.
Here, West can count on 7 tricks (6 hearts, a spade) at the time she bids 1@h, so 2@H is not unreasonable. 
You can expect some cards in East hand.

at|mitche: Play:  When West won the @SK, she got out with a heart, yielding a ruff-sluff.
Here, it turned out not to matter, but a better defense would be to get out with a diamond, 
forcing declarer to guess the diamond suit right or go down 2, as the cards sit.

CarlieG:  If East took the diamond return with the king (2nd trick if done as you recommend), what should East lead back?
mitche:  Another diamond
