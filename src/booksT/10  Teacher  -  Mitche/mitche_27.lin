^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |

^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

mitche: Hi, everyone and welcome to tonight's 2 over 1 play and discuss session.
2 over 1 means: 
If your partner opens in first or second seat and you bid a non-jump 2 level bid, it is game-forcing.
Also if pard opens 1@H or 1@s in first/second seat, your response of 1NT (with no intervening bid) 
is forcing for 1 round .  Otherwise, the bidding looks a lot like SA|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||at|92612:  Mitch, do you use reverse Bergen with 2/1? 
And do you use Drury?
mitche: I prefer regular Bergen, not reverse. 
Because you need the game invite more over the weaker response
Yes, 2-way reverse, but any Drury agreement is useful

sk||pc|hj|at|mitche: An immediate double of a suit bid on your right, as East's double of 1@S was, 
is conventionally for takeout, showing (usually) shortness in the suit bid on your right  
and support for the other 3 suits
In this case, East has got spades and does not have diamonds, so double is not the bid to make|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: The hand is worth just 11 HCP, including a singleton @DJ, 
which is probably useless to E/W on offense or defense
So East’s hand is better suited to passing
If East feels really brave or adventuresome, she might try 2@H, but I think pass is the best thing to do here
This hand would like to defend a spade contract!|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Let's look at South's bid
After the double, she has a decent-looking hand, but not a single spade in it.
So whatever is correct, 1NT isn't it :(
Better is a natural, non-forcing 2@D bid. South has diamonds, so why not bid what you've got???
BILAsst10: over the X, 2@D no longer GF
mitche: that is true.
Here is how most pairs do things after a double..|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt||at| 
A 1-level bid is almost as if the doubler had passed, It shows a GOOD 6 or 7 to about 9 or 10 points
A single raise (e.g. 1@S  X  2@S) is 3-card support, perhaps as few as 5 points up to about a bad 8-count
A double raise (1@S X 3@S) is weak, showing 4 card support and some distributional values
A redouble shows 10+ HCP and at most 2 card support. 
And finally, most pairs play that 1@S X 2NT = 4 card support and 10+ dummy points|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Some pairs use BROMAD - Bergen Raises of Major After Double.
So S wants to bid 2@D, which should get N very excited.

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: OK - on to Play: In fact, 6@D can be made
The final contract of 3NT is cold, as things are, 
but declarer should win a heart in dummy and set up a spade trick to make 10, not 9.
Remember that structure for responding after a takeout double, folks! 
It is very standard, and you will save a lot of grief learning it and using it

sk||pc|d6|at|mitche: Bidding: When you miss an easy slam, it can be very depressing.
Especially when playing for money. 
So let's see if we can arrange to bid this hand for fun and profit to the best contract... 
I think that East should start off with 1@C, not 2@C
WHAT????? She has 21 HCP!!!!!!
But East has 2 perfectly good places to play, in spades or clubs|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: When you open 2@C, you show more than strength. 
You show a hand that will play either in your suit or in NT
Yes, there are times when you are so strong that you cannot afford to let pard pass, and this hand is awfully close
(it has 3 losers if a fit can be found)
But I promise you, with just 21 HCP, if pard cannot bid over 1@C, one of the opponents can and will|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So we would like to open this hand 1@C. 
Change the @C10 to the @CJ and I would open 2@C, since I can just about make game in hand opposite as little as the @SK
OK - so pard opened 2@C and we heard 2@H on our right (I will get to that bid in a bit)
What should W do over 2@H?|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: How many of you have an agreement on what to do when someone interferes with your 2@C auction?
There are several ways to communicate to pard. 
I use this one: Double is my weakest bid, showing a balanced hand with no aces or kings
PASS is the kind of hand that bids 2@D waiting.
The reason for using X as weak hand is that pard knows immediately whether to blast off or bid a cautious new suit (no longer forcing, by the way), or to pass and try for a big  penalty|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So when 2@H comes to W, playing that, she passes.
kyno40: how can you finish in 7@S on this hand please tell us also
mitche: after 2@C, it is really hard
But if E opens 1@C, then W makes a negative X over 2@H
East now knows about the 4-4 spade fit (and if W doesn't have 4 spades, she shouldn't negatively double) 
and can start a GF sequence with a 3@H cuebid
West bids 3@S|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: over 2@C, getting to the grand is really hard, 
BUT when E opens 1@C, then West can make a negative X over 2@H or 3@H, whichever S bids OK?
East then bids 4NT (RKC) and West bids 5@D (1 key card for spades)
East knows that they have all 5 key cards and the trump queen
So the only question is about kings
After a response to 4NT, if the 4NT bidder bids 5NT, it promises all 5 key cards and demands that her partner bid 6 of the trump suit without any kings, or (depending on agreement) her cheapest king.|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So after 5NT, W bids 6@C to show that lovely @CK
Now East can count 13 tricks - 4 spades in W hand, 6 clubs, 2 red aces, and a diamond ruff
That is how you get to 7 spades
jonnyquest: ...and, down it goes on a fantastical stab-in-the-dark Club lead! 
mitche: maybe.. If S uses a lightner double, maybe. 
But N is odds on to lead a diamond, hoping to give pard a ruff...|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Look at the bidding I suggested after 1@C.
Oh, one last point.. Suppose the bidding goes 1@S by your partner, 2@S by you, 4NT (Blackwood) by pard.   
What do you think is going on? 
After all, 2@S promised just 9 points, tops. What could pard possibly have to justify blasting off into Blackwood????
Remember that we do not open 2@C on 2-suited hands???
So when pard pulls the 4NT card, right!! He has a monster 2-suiter!!!

pc|d5|at|mitche: Bidding: After 3@C, what should East do?
I suggest a simple 3NT - East has the diamonds locked up, so why put partner under the gun?
3@D should be 4th suit forcing, and it would ASK pard for a diamond stopper
Even in a game-forcing auction (2@H established a game force, right???), the 4th suit should be asking for a stopper or for support of your major suit|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


nt||at|BILAsst10: assuming they are playing fsf what should W bid over 3@D?
mitche: I think that the 4th suit in this auction should mean "My hand thinks 3NT is right if you have a stopper"
Wayne_LV:  Another good reason for E to bid 3NT rather than @D's is she is holding 2 tenaces
mitche: true, Wayne

If dummy were not already high, declarer should think about keeping communications open between her hand and dummy, so it may be wiser for her to play the @CK before severing connections to dummy

pc|sk|at|mitche: Bidding: : E/W probably meant 2@D to mean just a diamond raise, and not an "inverted" raise.
If so, then W should just bid 3NT over 2@D and be done with things
3NT will fail on a club lead, but it makes on anything else
NOTE: when your pard raises 1@C to 2@C or 1@D to 2@D, do not expect to see a 4 card major in her hand. Ever!
(Note moviemaker: but if west thought it to be inverted, her correct bid is 2@h showing stoppers up the line
some play that 2NT = balnced minimum with both majors stopped, as Mitch does)|
pg| ***** 100 ***** |


nt||at|Pattipat: Wouldn't 2NT say 18-19 if not inverted? 
mitche: No, 1@D – 2@D - 2NT is invitational, showing around 15-16 points and a hand not suited for 1NT opener I think. 
It really depends on what 2@D meant
If it's inverted, then 2NT is natural, balanced minimum, both majors stopped
If 2@D is just a 7 point raise, then 2NT should be stronger.. 
But W has a pretty good 19, so 3NT looks quite correct after a simple raise|
pg| ***** 101 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: If my hand were something like 4441, I would probably bid 2NT over 2@D, 
figuring pard to have (implicit) club length.. But sometimes I am weird
alphonsea:  should I have doubled the 5@C bid for a @C lead?
mitche: Should E double 5@C? I would have... Looks like a pretty safe lead for the defense

sk||pc|h4|at|mitche: Bidding: After 1NT, East's got a pretty simple bid available to her - 3NT, showing 10-15 points and balanced shape
With only 8 or 9 HCP, she would invite. But the simple approach has 2 advantages - 
First, you tell the opponents nothing about your hand, so they have to guess what to do
Second, your pard has no room to get creative, either|
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Typically, because NT pays off so much better than clubs or diamonds - 
you  look for a minor suit game as responder only when your hand is really unbalanced,  with singleton or void in a  major and either 5- or a 6-card minor, too
Here is the arithmetic.. 3NT makes with about 25 or 26 HCP and pays 100 plus your game bonus
5@C pays the same 100, but your hands need to be about a king better than what you need for 3NT
Also, 3NT making 4 is 130, where 5@C making 6 is just 120|
pg| ***** 124 ***** |


nt||at| 
So especially at matchpoints, you need to be pretty sure that 3NT is unlikely to make before you commit to a minor-suit game
Hence the idea that minor-suit stayman is NOT looking for a 4-4 minor-suit fit, but more likely a 5-4 fit

up|45|pf|y|at|mitche: now - on to play..Modern defensive theory says that leading from Qxxx or Kxxx is more likely to cost your side a trick than to set up enough tricks to defeat 3NT
So here, the "book" lead is the @SQ
Since the opponents didn't use Stayman, your pard is likely to have 4 or more spades, 
but not at all likely to have 5 hearts or 4 good ones. 
The @SQ wins whenever pard has as little as 10xxxx and an entry

sk||pc|sk|at|mitche: Bidding: The West hand  has two kings and is good enough for a bid
My preference is for W to bid 1@S --even with a cruddy 4-card suit, you have to bid it as responder.
If you are playing Flannery, then there is an excuse for 1NT, but there is no excuse for playing Flannery!!!
Everyone has his ideas about the game, and one of mine is that flannery is not very useful.  
You can't ever lose a spade fit with proper bidding..|
pg| ***** 150 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: I have one pard, a gold LM, who plays Flannery with everyone but me. And she can't get it out of her head.
We finished second in a sectional last month in Baltimore because twice she opened 2@D Flannery, our agreement is that it's weak
My idea is really simple. 
Playing 2 over 1 or Standard, you bid what you have whenever possible
Expert conventions are useful, BUT!!! it is more useful to learn to play the system you have without errors and to add stuff as your knowledge of the system you play increases....Anyway .. back to our auction.|
pg| ***** 151 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: After 1@S, East has a rock-bottom, dead-minimum 2@H call
Figuring her partner for a bad hand without even enough for any kind of heart raise, 
Sherry's hand  could not be weaker for her 2@H bid
The @CQJ are not really worth 3 HCP unless pard has a club honor (A or K), and the @DJ is similarly not working without a matching @D honor in dummy
So 2@H is very, very pushy, even with 15 HCP|
pg| ***** 152 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Sherry was very fortunate for W to have the minor-suit kings 
(and after the pass, finding even one of them in dummy was a lucky stroke)
Yes, competitive, Sherry, but at these colors --- they call being vulnerable "being bloody" in England. This is why.
So to summarize the bidding.. W should respond 1@S.  If she does, N might just as well bid 1NT (natural) or pass, waiting developments
East has to guess whether to bid 2@H or 2@D over 1@S. 
3@H is a possibility, too, but it should show a better hand, say the @DAKJ and 2 small clubs (same HCP strength, but better suits and no wasted quacks)

up|52|pf|y|at|On to the play: N did well to overtake the @SQ and continue spades, forcing declarer to ruff high
That promotes a trump trick for the defense.  
Any other line and declarer probably makes 10 tricks
One point on defense... When declarer crossed to the @DK to take a  trump finesse, South should place the @DA in declarer's hand
That means, when he gets in with his ruff, leading another @D is very, very risky. Better to be happy with the unexpected trump and just get out with a trump|
pg| ***** 167 ***** |


nt||at|alphonsea:  I read the lead of the @SJ as asking for higher of 2 remaining suits
mitche: Declarer can still win the diamond with an endplay in clubs, but leading that @D will lose in the long run
Peggy's play in spades was 10, Ace, 9.. had she wanted a diamond, she would have played the jack somewhere in there
But good point anyway, Alfonse! |
