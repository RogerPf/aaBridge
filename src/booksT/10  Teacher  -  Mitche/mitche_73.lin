fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back yard), 3 (spoiled) recue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."
Mitch Edelman aka mitche 



MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.
Thank you Eileen (wyoming33) for sending the hands and editing the chatlog! @h

|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at|mitche: Bidding:   After 1@c by South, what should West do?
As a Michaels cue bid would show the majors and 2NT would be unusual for the 2 lower suits (hearts and 
diamonds), West needs to bid both of her suits.  Happily her hand is strong enough to do this.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|
If she begins with 1@d, she would likely be able to bid 2@s naturally to get both her suits in at the 2 level.
A 2@d bid should be a 1-suited hand with long diamonds (headed by @dKQ10xxx or better) 
and no good outside suit or high cards.  In other words, a "preemptive" jump overcall.
|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Essentially a weak jump overcall is the kind of hand you'ld open a weak 2 with.  
Except you absolutely deny an outside Ace or King.
So West would like to bid 1@d, not 2.
Over 2@d, North has a hard hand to bid.  Give South the doubleton @DK instead of the singleton, 
and 3NT may be making, so I would try 3@d. 
If partner cannot bid 3NT, then certainly return to clubs.
|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||at|BILAsst10: 3@D here is asking for stopper? 
mitche:  Right.  It shows a limit+ raise in clubs, but opener should bid 3NT or show a stopper, 
rather than look for 5@c.

at|mitche:  Play:  At 3@c, West correctly led a high @D.
East, not having the @DQueen, correctly played the 3, saying "I would appreciate a shift."
But when the @DQ shows up at trick 1, West should continue with the @DK.  Why? |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


at|
gypsy1308: Shorten trumps.
mitche:  Well, tapping declarer is not going to make much difference here, but a shift is very dangerous.
West KNOWS that the only play where continuing the suit is bad is if South has @DQJx.
|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Declarer is trying to convince West not to continue the suit (imagine that South has the @dQJx, 
then East would have at most 2 diamonds, and declarer would like a shift).
To demonstrate, take a deck of cards and lay out the diamond suit with West having @dAK and 
at least 6 diamonds (for the jump overcall), North the @d109, South with @dQJx.  
That leaves room for East to have at most 2 diamonds.  
So a @D continuation will allow East to possibly overruff dummy. 
=> West should reason that it cannot hurt to continue diamonds at trick 2.
|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  The @S shift turned out to blow a trick. 
At trick 2, by the way, declarer should put in the @SQ.  if the @SQueen holds, then no spade loser. 
And if not, then declarer can try to ruff out the @S10 and set up the 9 for a possible discard of a heart.
Last point on this hand:
West has advertised length in diamonds, so East is going to have fewer @Ds than west.
So that leaves more room in the East hand for "not Diamonds" than there is room for "not Diamonds" in 
West's hand.  
|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  So if East has more "not diamonds" than West, the odds of the @CQ being with East are 
greater than they are that Her Majesty will be with West.
That said, it is correct for South to start the clubs with a small card toward dummy's Ace.
If the clubs are divided 2-1 then it doesn’t matter which club (Ace or King) gets played first.  
But if they are 3-0, EAST is more likely to have the 3 than West because she has more "not Diamonds" than West.
|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Those little things may save one trick every now and then. Here, it makes the difference between

|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


at|mitche:  Bidding:  West would like partner to have done something other than open 2@h. 
But when she does, the correct bid by West is PASS.
You know my rule of holes. When you are in one, stop digging!
So pass on this obvious misfit and hope for a small minus or for the opponents to rescue you.
And should North rescue E/W?  |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


at|Not without spades!
If North wants to bid, 2NT would be a better choice, but pass is best.
|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  With a bare 13 points and length in hearts, double is a very unhappy choice. 
If you bid with North hand, sometimes you will get to 3NT and make it, but more often, you will get clobbered.
The clue that passing is a better idea is the length North has in hearts.
If your partner has heart length, then declarer is in trouble.
And if he has heart shortness, then you have to figure out how to dispose of 4 heart losers in your hand.  
To balance with 2NT requires about 15 -16 HCP.

at|mitche:  Play:  Believe it or not, this is one of those times when leading an unsupported Ace is correct.
The odds are that the @CK is in dummy (North doubled), so the @cKing is going to score anyway.
So West can lead and continue clubs at trick 2 (the @C8 is encouraging).  
East may be able to ruff a club.  Turns out that East cannot, but any other lead risks blowing a trick.

at|mitche: Bidding:  North's 4@s bid is a pretty standard (as in universally-played) bid, showing 5 card support and 
a weak hand with some distributional strength--good bid!
Note that West's hand is not nearly strong enough to bid 2@h, so pass over 1@s is 100% right.
And East has nowhere to go, vulnerable.
South had hoped for a more constructive bid than 4@s 
(imagine that North has the @HAce and @DKing, then 6@s is good).
But over 4@s, the only option for her is to pass.

at|mitch:  Play:  It is conventional, when leading a side suit, to lead small from 3 to an honor, 
so West's correct lead from that holding is the @C5, not the @cJack.
Reason: leading the Jack promises either shortness or the @CTen.  
Reason for that: any other holding risks costing a defensive trick.  
Note that declarer has 10 tricks, no more, no less.
BILAsst10: Is there a better suit to lead than @C?
|
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Club is OK. Dummy rates to be weak... a trump won't help the defense set up tricks, 
but neither will it blow one, unless it locates the trump Queen for declarer.  
I prefer to make passive leads in this kind of auction, so a low club is as good as anything.

at|mitche: Play: When East runs the spades, West should pick one suit and discard it, holding onto length in the 
other one.  My guess would to ditch clubs (hearts are marginally better).  Declarer should ditch a 
diamond and not come down to KQ in the round suits, because that will set up a defensive trick  
(the defense plays the suit you come down to a doubleton, and when they come in with either the 
other ace or the @D, then they have cards to cash.

at|mitche:  Bidding:  West opened in 4th seat, so East can reasonably expect a full opener 
(if West has a subminimum hand, she will pass).  So that makes a 3@s bid more tolerable.
But I recommend using Drury here, where East bids 2@c 
(if you use 2-way reverse Drury, it shows 3-card support.)
CarlieG:  Why doesn't East raise with 3 card support?
mitche: A 2@s raise would be an underbid, and most pairs use 1@s - 3@s to show weak 4 card support.
East knows that E/W have an 8-card fit. 
|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  West will bid 2@s with a subminimum opener, 4@s with no slam interest, and (the way I play Drury) 
will bid 2@h with 5-4 in the majors.
Just in case East has 4 hearts and 3 spades, you want to be in your 4-4 Major fit instead of your 
5-3 Major fit.
With 4 card support,  the reverse Drury call is 2@d.  Some people use something called "BAMX" 
which uses 2-level bids to show 3-card support and 3-level bids to show 4-card support.  
I don't particularly care for that, because you may wind up on the 3 level with minimum values.
|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


nt||at|kadu:  Yes 2@D Drury or 3@C Reverse Bergen (with a 4-card).
mitche:  Marty Bergen tells me that Bergen raises are off by passed hand.  
And yes, I do talk with Marty about bidding. (I edit his books).
However you do it, E/W belong in 4@s. It takes some bad luck to defeat it.
3NT makes, but that is not the point. 
East has 3 card support AND a ruffing value, so 4@s rates to make more often than not.

at|mitche:  Bidding:  If you play Garbage Stayman, Washington style, then the auction 
1NT - 2@c 
2@d - 2@h     demands the 1NT opener to bid 2@S when he has 3-3 in the Majors.  
Reason:  The 2@h bid over 2@d promises 4-4 in the Majors and IF responder has a 5-card major, it will be spades.
(MM: In sayc this auction shows 5-4 in Majors (where the 5-card is bid) and invitational values)

at|mitche:  Play:  Declarer left one trump outstanding.  
Better would be to knock out the clubs before playing trumps.
Reason: The defense is going to shorten declarer's trumps if they have the chance to do so.
When you set your side suit up before trumps are gone, you protect yourself against bad breaks in 
clubs and in trumps.

nt||at|mitche:  One more point: When declarer lost the to @cKing in South and a diamond came back 
(around trick 9, I think), she can ruff with the @SQueen, discarding a small heart from dummy, then 
play a heart to the @hAce, pull the last trump, and cash 2 good clubs.  
Discarding a heart from hand actually cost 2 tricks.

Thanks to Eileen for her generous assistance and to all of you for your courteous attention and participation.
MM: You can play the hand Double Dummy if you wish
This concludes this presentation, hope you enjoyed, Karen10 & GG_Bridge|
