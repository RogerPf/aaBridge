^-{ An Introduction }
^-|CP||at|^B@2^Y@3Recently, I decided to learn the New Minor Forcing convention--NMF. So, I gathered all the related information from Howard's mentoring sessions, copied information on the topic from several web sites and good books, and put them--along with Howard's responses to my multiple questions--in a text file in no particular order.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

Next, I read the document several times to remove the repetitions and minutiae. Then, I arranged them in order which I could easily follow. By then I had a reasonable grasp of NMF. So, I decided to record it as a BBO movie for my future reference. As usual, NMF comes in many variations and flavors. However, in this preparation I tried to stay within the mainstream and follow Howard's "More often than not" rule.|

Before, I go further I like to mention that the material presented here is solely for my learning and I would like to thank Howard for his help to clear my confusion after reading pages of material on NMF as I have said it before, I do not claim to know bridge to write on it. The NMF presented here differ from what you have learned and practice. However, the notion of, "If it is good for Howard it is good for me too", is what I have focused on.|

Moreover, I would like to thank Marge for her time consuming and in depth editing of this presentation as I also hardly can write. Many thanks to Mihailo (BBO nickname "Miksa") for his recommendations.|

^-{ What is New Minor Forcing }
^-|CP||at|^B@2^Z@3^*BNew Minor Forcing ^*N|cp||at|(NMF) is a convention used to discover a major suit fit when opener rebids 1NT or 2NT after opening one of a minor and receiving a response of one of a major, such as 1D-P-1H-P; 1NT-P-?. It has the following features which I will explain later.|

Responder has game values and wants to bid game. But he is not sure whether to play in 4@H, 4@S, or 3NT. So first he bids 2@D (NMF) to find out about opener's majors. After opener's response, responder will then be able to determine whether 3NT, 4@H, or 4@S is the best contract.|

2@H is correct. North is not strong enough to bid NMF to invite game. North just wants to find the best spot, either 2@H or 2@S. You cannot bid NMF with less than invitational values.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |

Let us look at why we should use NMF in the first place.|

What should you bid? |
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Playing standard you have no good bid. You have the strength to rebid 2NT, but you would like to show your five-card heart suit. Therefore, you may choose to raise 1NT to 2NT. |
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Y@3
The problem with this bid is that if opener has a minimum, he would pass and you may miss a 5–3 heart fit. In fact, 2@H may be the best contract if partner is minimum. |
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


AT|

The solution to this dilemma is to use the unbid minor suit as responder’s forcing bid, hence the name New Minor Forcing. In the example above, responder could bid 2@D. This promises at least invitational values and is a one-round force.|

%%%%%%%%% opener's response CHAPTER<<<<<<<<<<
qx|P2,The Opener's Response to NMF |HT|d|cs|1|cp|4|fp||at|
^-{ The Opener's Response to NMF }
^-|CP||AT|^b@2^z@3We learn of the following information when NMF auction begins. Opener generally has 12-14/a bad 15 points (a minimum opening hand) and does not have a five-card major because he did not open one of a major. Further, assuming the partnership plays strong NT, he does not have  a balanced 15-17 point hand. For now, let us keep the 2NT bid aside. Moreover, opener does not have four-card support for the major bid by the responder. Hearing a NMF bid from responder, opener's obligation is to further explain his hand's |CP|8|AT|SHAPE |CP||AT|and |CP|8|AT|STRENGTH. |CP||
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


AT|

Responder should not bid NMF unless he has invitational or game values--at least 10 high card points or more. Even a responder who is a passed hand must hold a minimum of 9+ points in order to bid NMF. As usual, the point ranges given by different experts are not the same. Personally, I like to use Bergen's counting technique and consider any hand with 10+ Starting Points suitable for NMF bid--passed hand or not.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


AT|

What if the responder's hand has less than an invitational values? Generally, with fewer points the responder should pass the 1 No-Trump rebid or, with support, raise the first suit of the opener. Regardless, the responder's hand should be at least strong enough to bid at the two level or to be in game either in No-Trump or one of the majors.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


AT|

Armed with that information, let us consider what the available second rebids are for the opener playing NMF. First, opener should re-evaluate his hand's strength and determine whether the hand's value is "minimum" (12 to poor 13) or "maximum" (good 13 to 14). Strength determines the level and the shape determines the type of his bid. Again, let me repeat that the opener does not have four-card support for the bid major. If he did he would have raised the suit and not bid 1NT.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


AT|

Opener's first obligation is to show 3-card support for the major bid. Therefore, holding 3-card support, he bids the major at the two level with "minimum opening hand" and at the three level with a "maximum opening hand." If he does not have such support, he bids 2NT with a minimum or 3NT with maximum hand.  Some experts recommend using 2@D instead of 2NT so the partnership can explore further and avoid a possible bad 3NT auction. The first priority, however, is to show support for the responder's major. Let us look at some examples. You see only the opener's hand.|

^bWhen we have 1@C/@D-P-1@S-P-1NT situation, NMF is more involved. In the following auctions:|
ht|I|cs|6|at|^B{|ia|,1DP1sp1nP2c|at|}^m OR|HT|I|at|^o{|ia|,1CP1SP1Np2d|at|} |
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


ht|m|Va|4|at|^b@2^z@3Generally, when responder bids 1@S and then bids NMF he |FP|2|AT|always |FP||AT|has five spades or more and may also have four hearts. For that reason, playing NMF in this situation, opener's first priority is to show his 4-heart suit if any. Not having a 4-card heart suit, the next priority is to show a 3-card spade suit. Holding neither, he should bid NT. The level of each rebid correlates with the value of the hand. In this situation the priority clearly is given to showing the 4-card heart suit. |
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


AT|

By doing so, the partnership doesn't miss a 4-4 heart fit which is preferable to a 5-3 spade fit. Moreover, the bidding stays low and allows the partnership to explore further. The rest is similar to when responder bids one heart. The following are opener's next rebid options in the above auctions in order of their priority.   |

^-{ NMF When Responder Bids One Spade }
^-|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Although most people agree that with 4 hearts and 3 spades, opener should bid 2@H, some people play that opener should bid 2@S (responder is known to have 5 spades for sure).|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


AT|

Basically, there are 3 schools of thought over how to respond to NMF when opener has both 3 cards in responder's major and 4 card in the other major.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


AT|

a) Always bid hearts regardless of whether responder's first bid was 1@H or 1@S (e.g. show 3-card heart support over 1@H and 4 hearts over 1@S). This is what you recommend in the movie and is the most common way to play,

b) Always show 3-card support.

c) Always show the 4-card major.|

This is what Howard said: "North should bid 2@D, NMF, to see if South has 3 spades. Six spades is a terrible contract, as it depends on someone having specifically Ax of spades and you're guessing who that is. I would guess it's about a 5% slam."|

^b@2^Z@3One important point which most know but is worth repeating here. |HT|r|AT|

^-{
    As an opener, try as hard as possible not to rebid 1N with a singleton.
    }

Prepare your opening bid so this will be avoided. There are hands where it is the best bid avoiding a 1NT rebid--hands with five clubs and four diamonds. Some experts advocate opening 1D when you have 4 diamonds and 5 clubs--Howard objects to that.  An example follows.|

Open 1@D not 1@C for ease of bidding since you have a singleton. You can bid 2@C after a 1@S bid by partner. Next are comments from Howard.|
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, 1@D is correct so you can bid 2@C over 1@S. However, I would not hate bidding 1N over 1@S, in which case one could argue you could open 1@C as that is your better minor. Your suggested auction tends to show 5 diamonds and 4 clubs. 4-4-4-1 hands are always tough to bid.

^-{NMF After a Jump 2NT Response}
^-|CP||ht|f|at|^bUsing NMF over 2N rebids is a bit complicated. In the following two auctions |cs|6|

AT| Similarly if the auction goes,|cs|6|
ht|m|at|^b{|ia|,1Dp1sp2Np|at|}|at|^m or|HT|m|at|^o{|ia|,1CP1sP2Np|at|} |ht|q|at|
The opener ^*Udoes not have four spades but does not deny holding four hearts^*N. Why, you may ask. Because opener must bid 2N with any |CP|8|at|balanced|CP||AT| 18-19 hand even with four spades in the first two auctions and bid 2NT with four hearts in the last two auctions. In the first two auctions, with 18+ and an unbalanced hand opener rebids 2 spades if he has four spades and does not have four hearts. Moreover, in responding to NMF, opener does not need to show strength as he has already shown 18-19.  Therefore, his responses should show his holding in the majors. |
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


AT|

One more point. In the first two auctions, the 1@H bidder (the responder) does not necessarily have 5 hearts; he may just be 4-4 in the majors. As a general rule, a 2N bid establishes a game force and usually should not be passed. On occasion, however, responder will pass with up to a bad 6. |
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


AT|

After all said and done, in the above four auctions, NMF would help to discover a 4-4 hearts fit, or a 5-3 fit in either major, or a safe 3NT. Let us explore the issue more.

When partner bids NMF, you prefer your 4-card suit to 3-card support. But, if partner denies the 4-card suit, she must have 5 of the other suit, because otherwise she would not have bid NMF.|

However, most of the time, slam will be iffy, so I would probably content myself with 3N. Further, 6N is the hardest slam to make. It is almost always easier to play in a suit slam.|

A new suit by responder is forcing for one round. For opener, a new suit is not forcing. The only way to make a forcing rebid is either to reverse or jump shift. Also, keep the following in mind that when:|
