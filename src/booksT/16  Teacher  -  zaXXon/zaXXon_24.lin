MM: The recommended screen resolution for .lin movies is 1440 x 900 pixels 
(rightclick on your desktop,select "personalize" "screen definitions")
Also, make sure you have "widescreen" checked in your windows BBO-version
(If you're not sure about your settings log into your BBO windows version then:  
click the yellow tool at bottom and under the "general" tab check "widescreen" and save)
This will prevent the "cutting off" of the bottom parts or scrambling of your text in these presentations.

If you downloaded BBO recently, you will not be able to get online with the windows version...
You can still change or check your settings: 
Go to your C disc, and under "programs" find the Bridge Base Online folder
Open it and find the "profiles" folder
Open and scroll to find: BBO_Default_Settings 
line 71 should read: WIDE_CLIENT=1
If your setting is 0, change it to 1 and save. This will change your settings to "widescreen".

As an ALTERNATIVE: Open your aaBridge program and simply drag and drop the file of this presentation 
on the aaBridge screen.

fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2zaXXon:  Hello friends, welcome.  

As you were informed probably, we are at the end of our classes - this is our last meeting. 
I hope you enjoyed it as I did and I wish you many successful guesses in the future.
I promise, that when I find time, I’ll be back, may it be for short visits only.

During the last six months we were together in the field of guessing. 
We tried to place honors, to "read" the opponents hands, to create and kill entries, to win tempo, to promote
trump tricks, to deceive the declarer or defenders and so on....
But whatever we call it, all is leading to one and the same - most important thing in card playing - counting!

The count is everything.
Whatever decision we are going to take, it is doomed to be wrong if it is not based on a good count.
And vice versa - if you count well, you have a fine picture of the hand and are well-placed to take correct 
important decisions.

Here we will have some examples to see what I'm talking about. 


MM: @d@dMany thanks to David (Major_blue) for saving the hands and editing the chat for this presentation! @d@d

pc|ck|pc|c6|At|zaXXon: Having probably a strong hand, our LHO is declarer at a @h-slam
Partner leads the @cK
The dummy looks quite normal, based on the bidding

at|zaXXon: Think quickly - what will be the next move from dummy?|pg||nt||at|zaXXon: Well, there are still cards in all suits in dummy, so declarer could play everything :)

OK, let us count a little: What is declarer' distribution?|pg||nt||at|zaXXon: Should we know?..  Suit by suit 
- how many trumps?|pg||at|
Yes, 5 trumps.
Singleton @dK we saw.
He took the @cA and discarded 2 @c's on @d's, so he had @cAxx
So his full hand was?|pg||nt||at|zaXXon:    4=5=1=3
So declarer's last 5 cards are?  Can we imagine?|pg||at|
wyoming33: 3@s 2@h
zaXXon: Very true
Can we expect what kind of spades he has?|pg||nt||at|
wyoming33: At least one honor  Probably the K - we have to hope that P has the Q at least
zaXXon: He almost surely has the King. If he has Q too, he should claim, 
so we must expect @sKJx  and the next move from dummy is a @s for sure...|pg||nt||
pc|S3|lb|*cWhich spade should you play?^^s6,s7^s7s6sa|at|zaXXon: And we have to play to trick 9’s lead of @s3...?|pg||nt||
pc|S7|sk||at|zaXXon: I hope you understand that declarer has to guess now, the K or J.
If he plays the K, he makes
If Jack then he goes  -1
|pg||nt||at|Do you see that when we play the Ace, we solve declarer's problem?
Also, if we start thinking ^*unow^*n what to play, we solve the problem as well 
– our pause gives away the location of the Ace, so he will never try  the  J.|pg||nt||
pc|SJ|pc|SQ|at|BILAsst11:  South should play the Ace  he can see the trump in dummy
zaXXon: Yes! There is a trump in dummy! 
But there are 3 spades in hand and declarer can’t ruff them all with 1 trump!!!
|pg||nt||
pc|S4|pc|D8|pc|SA|pc|ST|pg||
mc|11|pg||


up|39|pf|y|at|zaXXon: Your mind should go together with the play, like this:
1. declarer cashes trumps - you immediately notice he has exactly 5 trumps
2. He cashed @dK and played a trump - you  make a mental note that this King is singleton.
3. He cashes @dAQJ - you count his hand as 4513 and count his tricks:
4. He has 5 trumps + 1 ruff in dummy (later) + 4 @d's + @cA = 11
So he needs a @s-trick - oh yes, we will have to make him  guess.|pg||nt||at|zaXXon: Some advice - if you can't count quickly, you may slow down the play...
but your mind should follow the play trick by trick. 
The fact that declarer has 3 spades in hand makes our Ace a sure trick so no need to hurry :)
One more point - don't be afraid to play small over dummy' singleton when there are not enough trumps to ruff
Our Ace is a sure trick anyway.|pg||nt||at|BILAsst11:  Is there a way to keep two trumps in dummy?  Trick four he wasted 2.
msphola:  I might have overtaken the @d after drawing trump, to enable me more ruffs in spades
zaXXon: It’s the same - you will have an extra ruff, but a @d-trick less.  
Maybe declarer had expected to score 5 @d-tricks.
But there is no entry to dummy.
He could overtake  @dK and would have two trumps now and four spades in hand !|pg||nt||at|

wyoming33: This may be declarer's 9th trick
amcs:  Take and play spade
Rabbit2W:  unless....p can cash 4 fast @s...
cad:  Watch partner’s play in clubs. You will know p has a club left and declarer is searching for 9th trick|pg||nt||at|zaXXon: So unanimous! 
Are you feeling you have to hold up, or it is based on some count?
zenoo:  You play standard carding?
zaXXon: Yes, totally standard, partner has played the @c3 and @c7|pg||at|
Rabbit2W:  P really seems to have at least four @s's left
maysie: Rule of 11 ...ie know declarer still has one higher @s-card than P's lead  ...
|pg||nt||at|zaXXon: Don't rush :)   With how many @c's did partner start?
zenoo:  3
zaXXon: and declarer?|pg||at|
Also 3:  AKx - so this is a "deception" ... he wants us to believe that he is looking for an entry!
Another point of view - Who remembers partner's lead?|pg||at|
msphola:  @s6
zaXXon: If we apply the rule of 11, declarer has how many higher spades?|pg||nt||at|zaXXon: 11-6 = 5;      We had the Q9 and dummy the 7
msphola:  West only has 1 card higher than the 6 left
zaXXon: If declarer has the @sAce, then partner led @s6 from J10863... why not the J??
It seems the second higher spade with declarer is either the Jack or 10...
So, we take and play @s9 and ask partner to cash 4 tricks
If we hold up, we lose the contract.|pg||nt||

Partner has the @sQ and declarer is trying to dispose of his spade loser somehow.
Com'on, share your minds :)

zaXXon: Yes,            where is the @dK?|pg||nt||at|cad:  Partner has shown 2 or 4 @d’s so it cannot hurt to trump
zaXXon: Yes, partner played high-low.
He should have 4, declarer 3 diamonds, and you may bet partner does not have the @dK
If he does, declarer would go to hand to finesse again.|pg||at|

up|28|pf|y|at|zaXXon: The slam is not bad, by the way.
2-2 trumps or 3+ @d's with long trumps, it's a fair one
Additionally, if partner has @sKQ10xxx he could bid weak 2@s over 1@h in that vulnerability, but he didn't
Then declarer started with 2 spades...and needs to get rid of one.

@cQ lead against 4@s

Rabbit2W:  There goes partner's only likely high card other than the @cJ
wyoming33: The defence can take two @s's and a @d - where is a 4th?
msphola:  West should have the @hAKJ, the @cA and the @dK|pg||nt||at|zaXXon: I see nothing wrong, everything you said is correct.
So, we need 2nd @d trick, right?

pc|D5|at|If he plays the King, down 1
He has no options, however....
He knows he is losing 2 trumps, the @dAce... So he can’t afford to lose another diamond  

He took the opening-lead in hand and played a trump to the Jack.
We took the Ace (!) and pretend we go for a @d “ruff”, to beat the contract... @dAce and then small...|pg||nt||at|If he finesses @d now, he may go down in an easy hand 
(partner "takes the @dQ" and gives us a "ruff")
This looks very likely 
=> he would take and finesse the @sQ again as it sure looks like partner has the @sQ
but we know it's a losing finesse.
|pg||nt||sk||
at|zaXXon: Please note, that we can lose nothing.
btour:  So it does not matter to mislead partner at this point. 
zaXXon: Sure, you know partner is out of hand after the lead,
