MM: The recommended screen resolution for .lin movies is 1440 x 900 pixels 
(rightclick on your desktop,select "personalize" "screen defenitions")
Also, make sure you have "widescreen" checked in your windows BBO-version
(If you're not sure about your settings log into your BBO windows version then:  
click the yellow tool at bottom and under the "general" tab check "widescreen" and save)
This will prevent the "cutting off" of the bottom parts or scrambling of your text in these presentations.

If you downloaded BBO recently, you will not be able to get online with the windows version...
You can still change or check your settings: 
Go to your C disc, and under "programs" find the Bridge Base Online folder
Open it and find the "profiles" folder
Open and scroll to find: BBO_Default_Settings 
line 71 should read: WIDE_CLIENT=1
If your setting is 0, change it to 1 and save. This will change your settings to "widescreen".

As an ALTERNATIVE: Open your aaBridge program and simply drag and drop the file of this presentation 
on the aaBridge screen.

^b@2zaXXon:  Hello friends, welcome.  

Are you ready, because we have some contracts to beat...
Today we will continue our defence battles against declarers, attacking their main weapon - trumps.

If you remember our session from last week, there are two ways to create a trump trick:
^*bA) promotion^*n|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


at|
^*bB) upper-cut^*n

We went through both of them, but let us recollect both ways with simple examples.




MM: @d@dMany thanks to David (Major_blue) for saving the hands and editing the chat for this presentation!
And special thanks to Eileen (wyoming33), always there to help out! @d@d

A quick count will show you, that partner could have a Jack (@C) at most
so, we have to beat 4@S alone... or almost alone.|

at|
wyoming33: N & E both out of @H's - can P have the @S8 to force the Ace
zaXXon: Nice point, Eileen - the @S8 is the key card here.
If partner has it, it may upper-cut the Ace, so we would have 2 master trumps.
Next question, which @H to play?    Partner won't trump if we lead the @hJ|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: A small one will force partner to ruff, and we hope that he will use his higher trump...
The truth is, he must ruff even if we play the Jack
wyoming33: Do you mean there is a way to tell P to trump as high as possible?
zaXXon: He would know that declarer does not have a 3rd @H, 
and looking at that dummy he must find out to ruff with the @S8 - if he has it|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: Still, the @H9 looks best for me and tells partner: 
"Please ruff and help, if you can."

pc|hk|at|zaXXon: Partner leads the @HK against a 4@S contract.
You may expect declarer to hold 5+ (most likely 6) spades and  around 5-9 points.
Dummy is as strong, as expected.
We will take 2 @H-tricks and we need 2 trumps to beat the contract. 
We are going to promote our trump holding. |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: So, the defence is almost automatic. 
There is the danger of giving declarer a @H-trick, if he has the Jack...
But who cares?     We just need a 3rd round @H's to be played.

When you are going to promote a trump trick (or to uppercut, does not matter), 
^*bmake sure declarer does not have a loser to discard!^*n
If he does - it's the wrong moment  (wrong timing).|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt||at|btour: How do we know, and what is the timing if he does?
zaXXon: Here he has one - and we had to cash it
Usually, we have to take winners first. 
We can delay a winner, if its a sure one ( = cannot dissapear)
Let us change the deal a little...|

Partner then cashes the @CAce !   followed by the @S8, which we take...
and now we play the 13th spade...

pg| ***** 60 ***** |

OK, let us check first...
We need 2 more and have 1 (the @DAce)
Can declarer be void in @D?
Not likely...  and if so, there is nothing we can do.
|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


nt||at|Ruah:  Probably not because if P had it he might have led the @dK
zaXXon: True
Can declarer have a singleton @D?|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


at|
Yes - and its likely - he will normaly have: 7@S + 2@C's + @HAK...
So, we have to cash the @dAce now
Before the key move - a @C for a trump promotion|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |

up|12|pf|y|at|zaXXon: One more point to note
Do you think it matters if dummy @C is high or not?
At the moment, @CJ is master
But say, we have the master @C
Do you think we have again to cash @DA before promotion?|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


nt||at|CarlieG:  Yes take @DA
zaXXon: Yes, it's the same - we still have to cash out
See, if we try to play @C first, the @D king is tossed....
We take the trick.....but there is no promotion anymore
CarlieG:  If @DK were in dummy would you still cash out your Ace?
zaXXon: Yes, the Ace takes once|
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: So most important point to remember - 

Try to make sure, that declarer has nothing to discard when you make your key move to promote a trump.
