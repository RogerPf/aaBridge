So, for example, if the contract is 2@H, declarer must take at least 8 tricks in order to get a positive score. Similarly, in order for the defenders to get a positive score, they must prevent declarer from taking the number of tricks he contracted for. So if the contract is 3NT, they must hold declarer to 8 or fewer tricks in order to get a positive score.|

In this tutorial, I will be discussing duplicate bridge scoring. There is another form of scoring called rubber bridge scoring, which used to be very popular in social bridge games. These days, even most social bridge players use what is known as "Chicago" scoring, which is identical to duplicate bridge scoring.|

Let me clarify some terms:
|cp|1|at|^*GLEG,Partscore^*N|cp||at| – a partscore is a contract where, if you make your contract exactly, the trick score is less than 100. So all contracts of 4@D or below (with the exception of 3NT) are partscore contracts. Even if you make overtricks such that your trick score is over 100 (for example, you are in 2@S but score 10 tricks so that your trick score is 120), the contract is still considered a partscore.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


ht|s|cp|1|at|^B@2
^*GLEG,Game^*N|cp||at| – any contract where, if you make your contract exactly, your trick score is 100 or more. Since different suits have different trick scores, the number of tricks you need to contract for in order to be in game varies by suit. In particular, the minimum game contracts are 3NT (trick score = 100), 4@H (trick score = 120), 4@S (trick score = 120), 5@C (trick score = 100), and 5@D (trick score = 100).

Small Slam – a 6-level contract, regardless of suit.
Grand Slam – a 7-level contract, regardless of suit.|

partscore bonus ^h– 50. You only get the bonus if you are in a partscore contract. If you bid game or slam, you do not get the bonus.
Game bonus ^H– 300 non-vulnerable, 500 vulnerable. You get this bonus for all game level contracts, including slams.
Small slam bonus ^h– 500 non-vulnerable, 750 vulnerable. You get this bonus for 6-level contracts only (not 7-level contracts).

6@D making 6 non-vulnerable ^h– 920 (trick score = 120 + 300 game bonus + 500 small slam bonus)
7NT making vulnerable ^H– 2220 (trick score = 220 + 500 game bonus + 1500 grand slam bonus).|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |

The scoring for making a doubled contract is a little more complex. Let me list them below.
^C@21. Trick scores are doubled for non-overtricks. For example, the trick score for clubs is doubled from 20 to 40 per trick and for hearts is doubled from 30 to 60.
2. Overtricks are 100 per trick not vulnerable, 200 per trick vulnerable, regardless of which suit the contract is in.
3. You get a 50 points bonus "for the insult."
4. If the trick score for making the contract exactly is 100 or more, you get the game bonus. So you can be "doubled into game" whereby a contract that would normally be a partscore if not doubled is now a game contract. Therefore, all partscore contracts between 2@H and 3@S along with 4@C and 4@D, if doubled, will become game contracts. Doubled contracts of 2@D and below remain as partscore contracts.|

PG| ***** 13 ***** |


AT|

Scoring greatly impacts the decision of whether or not to double. You get a bad result if an opponent makes a contract which you doubled into game. You turned a 50 point partscore bonus into a 300 or 500 point game bonus. If they make overtricks, especially vulnerable, that is also bad. You turned a small bonus of 20-30 per trick into a 100 or 200 point per trick.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


AT|

You never like it when the opponents make a doubled contract. However, if you did not double them into game (or they were already in game) and they did not make any overtricks, the consequences are not as bad. For example, notice that 1NT doubled making is 180 vs. 90 if not doubled, a difference of 90 points. But if they were vulnerable and you set them even 1, you would have gained 100 points. So, doubling them when you are pretty certain they will at worst make exactly and are likely to go down (and you are not doubling them into game) can be a reasonable bet.|

Although it is rare, for completeness let me discuss the scoring of redoubled contracts. The concepts are very similar to making doubled contracts.|

All redoubled contracts, except for 1@C and 1@D, that would be partscores if not doubled, are now redoubled into game. Note that the trick score for 1@H and 1@S redoubled is 120 and for 1NT redoubled is 160, all of which are over 100.|

At favorable vulnerability (you are not vulnerable and the opponents are vulnerable), you can afford to go down 3 and still make a profit. You will be minus 500 and their vulnerable game is worth at least 600.|

AT|

At equal vulnerability (whether both sides are vulnerable or not), you can afford to go down 2 and still make a profit. Non-vulnerable you will be minus 300 and their game is worth at least 400. Vulnerable you will be minus 500 and their game is worth at least 600.|

AT|

At unfavorable vulnerability (you are vulnerable and the opponents are not vulnerable) you can only afford to go down 1 trick and still make a profit. You will be minus 200 and their game is worth at least 400.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


AT|

Successful sacrificing at unfavorable vulnerability is rare. I have occasionally seen hands where it works out, but, unless you think there is some chance that you will make your contract, you should avoid purposely sacrificing at unfavorable vulnerability.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


AT|

Although redoubled contracts are very rare, I will briefly mention that the scoring is twice that of doubled contracts. Thus, for example, vulnerable undertricks are 400 for the 1st undertrick and 600 for each subsequent undertrick.|ht|y|at|Please click |cp|1|at|^*GB,here^*N|CP||AT| to return to the opening page.|

However, it was decided to use "International Matchpoint Scale" (on the left) in order to lessen the effect of a really bad result. The IMP scale translates absolute scores to a number between 0 and 24. For example, a score difference of 20-40 is 1 IMP, a score difference of 50-80 is 2 IMPS, and so forth. |
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


AT|

In the example in the last panel, +450 translates to 10 IMPs. Without the IMP scale, a score difference of 500 would be 10 times better than a score difference of 50. But with the IMP scale, +50 translates to 2 IMPs while 500 translates to 11 IMPS, so the 500 is 5.5 times better than the 50.|

A variant of IMP scoring (Cross - IMP scoring) is used for |cp|1|at|^*GLEG,Pairs Games^*N|cp||at| such as what is done on BBO. Each opponent's score is subtracted from your score and converted to IMPs. The IMPs are then summed and divided by the number of opponents.|

qx||HT|b|fp|1|cs|1|cp|4|at|^-{  Cross -IMP Scoring Used in Pair Games }
^-|cp||fp||ht|d|at|^B@2With the help of computers the Cross-IMP scoring is the mainstream now (used at BBO). In Cross-IMP your score on any particular board is compared with those of every other pair sitting in the opposite direction to you, across the field. Using the IMP chart the point difference in each comparison is converted to IMP. The total of these comparisons in IMPs is averaged to give you your score on that board.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


AT|

Steps of using this technique are: 
1) Every score on any particular board is compared against every other score for the respective pair. In other words, for every score, the scores of the opponents are subtracted.
2) The subtracted results are converted in IMPs by using International Matchpoint Scale.
3) Using International Matchpoint Scale convert the point differences to IMPs.
4) Average the IMPs which is the score for that pair.|

^-{ IMP Scoring Used in Team Match }
^-|HT|d|fp||cs||cp||at|^b@2Here are some conclusions you can draw from the above example:|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


AT|
Bidding and making the vulnerable game is very beneficial. Pair 1 gained at least 10 IMPS compared to the 3 pairs that bid and made the 3H partial score.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


AT|

Overtricks are not important. Pair 2 only gained 1 IMP for making 1 more trick than Pairs 3 and 4.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


AT|

Going down in a contract that makes is very costly. Pair 5 had a difference of over 18 IMPS compared to Pair 1 who bid the same contract and made it. And had Pair 5 bid and made 3@H, that would have saved them 6.5 IMPS.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


AT|

Prior to the advent of computers, scoring a pairs game using IMPs would have been impractical. For example, in a 24 board 8 table game, for each board, the director would have to calculate 56 IMP results (7 results for each of 8 pairs) over 24 boards, which would be over 1300 calculations, obviously too much work to do manually. That is why match points (see below) were invented for pair games, because the scoring is much quicker. With computers, IMP scoring is now practical with pairs games, but match points is still the norm for pair games at most live clubs. By the way, IMP stands for International Match Points.|

Victory points are used to determine overall places. They work as follows:

1. The IMP margin of victory is calculated for a given match.

2. That margin of victory is used to distribute victory points (typically 20 total victory points) between the 2 teams. The closer the match, the more evenly the points are distributed. |

For example, in a tie match, each team would get 10 victory points. If a team won by 10 IMPS, the winning team would get 14 victory points and the losing team 6 victory points. If a team won by 28 IMPS, the winners would get 20 victory points and the losers 0 victory points. The total number of victory points for a team is used to determine that team's rank in the event.|

^-{  Match Point Scoring by Howard Schutzman  }
^-|HT|d|fp||cs||cp||at|^b@2Match point scoring is what is used in most live pairs games. It works as follows:
^ca. You get 1 point for each pair whose score is worse than yours.
^cb. You get 1/2 point for each pair whose score is tied with yours.

In pair games, your score on a board is usually expressed in the actual number of match points you scored on that board. On BBO, it is expressed as a percentage of the maximum number of match points you could win on the board had your score been the highest. Let me repeat the example I used for IMP scoring, score it using match points, and compare it to the IMP score.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


HT|L|AT|Pair ^CContract ^fPoints ^IMPs ^kMP Percentage ^oDetails ^UIMP scores

5 ^c  4@H -1 ^f100 ^I0 ^k0%    ^OLost to all ^U-9.75

Here are some conclusions you can draw from the above example:

^c@2The size of your score does not matter, just how many people you do better than. Pair 2 did very well compared to Pairs 3 and 4 despite the fact that their score was only 30 points higher. Similarly, Pair 1 only did a little better than Pair 2 even though their score was 450 points higher.

^c@2Overtricks do matter. Pair 2 did much better than Pairs 3 and 4 by simply making an overtrick.

^c@2Bidding game does not always help as much as in IMPS. Pair 1 would have done almost as well had they been in 3@h making 4 (just like Pair 2).|

PG| ***** 56 ***** |


AT|

^c@2Average – the ## of pairs you did better than was about the same as the ## of pairs who did better than you. Your match point percentage is about 40% - 60%.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


AT|

^c@2Average Plus – you did better than a majority of pairs. Your match point percentage is about 65% - 85%.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


AT|

^c@2Average Minus – you did not do as well as a majority of pairs. Your match point % is about 15% - 35%.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


AT|

^c@2Top – you did better than all pairs, perhaps tieing 1 or 2 at most. Your match point % is about 90% - 100%.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


AT|
^c@2Bottom – you did worse than all pairs, perhaps tieing 1 or 2 at most. Your match point percentage is 0%-10%.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


AT|

^b@2Although the scores of individual boards are usually described in terms of actual match points (except on BBO where they use match point %), your overall score is usually expressed as a percentage of the theoretical maximum score you can achieve. For example, in an 8 table game with 24 boards, your theoretical maximum is 168 match points (7 match points on each board x 24 boards). If your match point score was 84, that would be a 50% game. A 55+% game is good and should usually earn you some master points. A 60+% game is excellent and will often result in a 1st or 2nd place finish.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


AT|

Most expert players prefer IMP scoring to match points. They feel it is a truer test of bridge skill and minimizes luck. I, on the other hand, strongly prefer Matchpoints. I think it a much more interesting form of bridge. Although bridge in any form is never boring, in IMP scoring many hands are inconsequential and you can relax. Even if the declarer or the defense slip a trick, that will only result in a small loss or gain. An IMP match comes down to how well you do on a small minority of crucial boards with big swings. In Matchpoints, on the other hand, every board counts. An overtrick can be crucial. You have to be on your toes on every hand because a small slip can be very costly.

PG| ***** 64 ***** |

Strive for consistency. Try to be average to above average on every hand. Do not take big risks in search of big rewards because you will fail more often than not. To do well at bridge, you need to minimize your mistakes, not try to maximize your score.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


AT|

Your first priority is to make your contract. This is obviously true for IMPs, where an overtrick is inconsequential. But even in Matchpoints, there are very few hands where you should risk your contract for an overtrick.|

^-|fp||ht|e|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|In IMPS, you do not need to be overly aggressive. You should not bid one more if you are reasonably certain you are going down. If you are going down, even if they make their contract, your IMP score will be similar. The Law of Total Tricks and my competitive bidding guidelines work very well in IMPs.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


AT|

partscore bidding in Matchpoints is much more complex. The size of your score does matter. Say for example, they are in 3@D and your suit is hearts. If they make 3@D, that is -110. Even if you go down 1 in 3@H,, that is -50 or -100, which is a better match point score. So you should be more aggressive in bidding 3 over 3 in Matchpoints (but it is still often the wrong thing to do).|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


AT|

In IMPs, the objective is to be plus. As declarer, you should always find the safest way to make your contract and worry very little about overtricks. Similarly, as defender, you should try and come up with a way to beat the contract, even if it is low percentage, because giving up an overtrick in the process is inconsequential once they make the hand.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


AT|

In Matchpoints, partscore strategy is much more complex. You have to try for the biggest plus or smallest minus you can get. As declarer, you should still always find a safe way to make your contract, but you can try a slightly less safe way in pursuit of overtricks. On defense, you often play passive defense, trying not to give up overtricks rather than trying to beat the contract.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


AT|

In IMPs, it is fairly rare (although not unheard of) that you double a partscore. Unless you are fairly sure you are setting them at least two, the risk of their making it when you double them into game outweighs the reward of extra points for setting them 1, even vulnerable. Usually you only double when you have length in their trump suit.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


AT|

In Matchpoints, doubling a partscore can be quite profitable. This is one area in which less experienced players are too timid. Down 1 doubled vulnerable is worth +200, which is a larger score than any partial you can make. This is just about guaranteed to be a top board. And if they make their contract, you were likely getting an average minus anyway. So doubling a vulnerable partscore has high reward and low risk. I get some of my best results using this tactic.|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Successful IMP players aggressively bid games, especially vulnerable games, even if they are less than 50%. Let me explain why. |
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


AT|

Say you are considering whether or not to bid 4@H. If you make it, you will be +620 (vulnerable) and your opponents will be +170, which means you will win 10 IMPs. If you go down, you will be -100 and your opponents will be +140, which means you will lose 6 IMPs.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


AT|

Suppose the odds of making game are only 40% (such as you need a 2-2 break). That means if the hand is played 10 times, it will make 4 times and go down 6 times. So you will win 40 IMPs the 4 times it makes and lose 36 IMPs the 6 times it goes down. Therefore, your net gain over 10 hands is 4 IMPs.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


AT|

The point of all this math is to demonstrate why you should bid all close games in IMPs, even if their odds are a little less than 50%.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


AT|

In Matchpoints, on the other hand, the game bonus is not worth any more than an overtrick. So you should only bid games where the odds favor that they make. You should avoid bidding close games. In fact, I would say it pays to be somewhat conservative when deciding whether or not to bid games in Matchpoints.|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|The decision of whether or not to bid a small slam is the same in both IMPs and Matchpoints. Basically, you should only bid a small slam that is better than 50%.|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


AT|

The math in Matchpoints is fairly simple. If you make it, you will score 1 match point over all opponents who do not bid the slam. If you go down, you will score 0 Matchpoints. If you don't bid slam, you will get 1/2 match point for a tie. So on a 50% slam you will break even over the long run, gaining 1/2 a match point half the time and losing 1/2 a match point the other half.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


AT|

The math in IMPS is as follows. Assume you are vulnerable and are bidding a major suit slam. If the slam makes, you will be +1430 and you opponent will be +680. You will win 13 IMPs for being +750. If the slam goes down, you will be -100 and your opponents will be +650. So you will lose the same 13 IMPs for being -750 instead of +750.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


AT|

You should only bid grand slams which are virtually certain to make. You should be able to count 13 tricks. In fact, if you never bid a grand slam, you will come out ahead in the long run. Even bidding a grand slam that simply depends on a 3-2 break (68%) is very iffy.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


AT|

The basic reasoning is because when you bid and make a small slam, most of the time you will be getting an above average result. As I said in the first part of this section, your goal should be to get average and above average results and avoid bad results. So there is little reason to try for a little extra by bidding a grand slam when you will be getting a good result anyway by bidding and making a small slam.|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Let's use IMP scoring to explain the reasoning mathematically. If you bid and make a major suit grand slam vulnerable, your score will be 2210. If your opponents only bid the small slam their score with be 1460. You will gain 13 IMPs for being plus 750. If the slam goes down, you will be -100 and your opponents will be +1430. You will lose 17 IMPs by being -1530. |
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


AT|

You will be plus 750 against pairs who don't bid the small slam (1430 for you vs. 680 for them) which is 13 IMPs. Let us assume that half the pairs bid the slam. (If you look on BBO at potential slam hands, you will find that most of the time less than half the pairs bid slam, so I think I am making a very reasonable assumption.) That means your IMP score will be +6.5 just for bidding the small slam.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


AT|

So where does that leave us? Let's say the grand slam is 70% (slightly better odds than a 3-2 break). On 100 hands, if you just always bid the small slam, you will win 650 IMPs (6.5 x 100). But, if you bid the grand slam, on 70 hands you will win 910 IMPs (70 x 13) and on 30 hands you will lose 510 IMPs (30 x 17) for a total gain of 400 IMPs. |
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


AT|

That means you are better off bidding the small slam (650 IMPs on 100 hands) than the grand slam (400 IMPs on 100 hands). And that is only if the grand slam is a strong favorite to make (70%). Some grand slams that you bid may be on a finesse or even worse. The bottom line is, that unless the grand slam is an overwhelming favorite (meaning you can count 13 tricks), you should not bid it.|

ht|g|at|^K@2^y@3To flatten the curve of raw score, it was decided to use "International Matchpoint Scale" (on the left) in order to lessen the effect of a really bad result. With such tool a score difference of 500 would be 10 times better than a difference of 50. The IMP scale translates raw scores to a number between 0 and 24. For example, a score difference of 50-80 is 2 IMP, a score difference of 500-590 is 11 IMPs, and so forth. With the IMP scale,  plus 50 translates to 2 IMPs while 500 translates to 11 IMPS, so the 500 is 5.5 times better than the 50.|

Victory points are a method of determining the winner of a team event where each team plays the same number of matches. The most common event of this type is Swiss Teams, where each team plays 7 matches each consisting of 7 boards. Victory points are used to determine overall places. They work as follows:

The IMP margin of victory is calculated for a given match. That margin of victory is used to distribute victory points (typically 20 total victory points) between the 2 teams. The closer the match, the more evenly the points are distributed. For example, in a tie match, each team would get 10 victory points. If a team won by 10 IMPS, the winning team would get 14 victory points and the losing team 6 victory points. If a team won by 28 IMPS, the winners would get 20 victory points and the losers 0 victory points.|

^-|fp||ht|c|at|^B@2^Z@3Howard did not have enough time to address many of his points and charts or explain some issues as he wanted to. This section is intended to do that. To better understand his tutorial it is important to become familiar with terms and definitions outlined here. As you will notice many of terms in the tutorial are blue hyperlinked and you can get back here and read on more. Some of very obvious definitions are not included. You can get back to the opening page by clicking a blue hyperlink at the bottom of each page.

^*BTrick^*N: It is a ^*Btrick^*N when four cards are played. There are only 13 trick during each deal.

^*BBoard or Deal^*N: The metal or plastic tray that holds the pre-dealt cards. This term also refers to the whole deal itself ("What was our score on Board ##4?" or "We played 26 boards against Joe's team."). 


^*BBook^*N: The first six tricks taken by partnership declaring. Only tricks in excess of book are counted for fulfilling the final contract. To make a contract of 4@S, you must take 10 tricks (6 for book plus the 4@S contract committed). Book also refers to the number of tricks the defenders must win before they can begin earning a score for defeating a contract. If the opponents' contract is 3@D, book for defenders is 4 tricks -- if they take a fifth trick, they defeat declarer's contract and earn a plus score.

^*BPoint^*N: Each trick is assigned a number of points which varies by the suit is awarded to the winning side. The first six tricks do not get any points. They are:
^C@2Each trick in minor suits = 20 points
Each trick in major suits = 30 points
In No-Trump the first trick = 40 points and the rest are 30 points each. 

^B@2^Z@3^*BContract^*N: Is the number of tricks the pair declaring commits to make. The number should be at least 7 (the first six is called the book). The highest number of tricks available in a contract are 13. In addition to the number each contract is in either a suit or in NT. |

^-|fp||ht|c|at|^B@2^Z@3^*BGame^*N: Is a contract whereby the declaring side commits to make at least 100 points. Because the value of each trick varies for suits and NT, therefore, partnership should make one of the following commitments.
^c@2In minors the commitment is 11 tricks. 6 (book) + 5 X 20 = 100. The first six tricks don't have any points.
In majors the commitment is 10 tricks. 6 (book) + 4 X 30 = 120. Each trick in majors is worth 30 points. That is 120 points which again is more than 100.
In NT the commitment is 9 tricks. 6 is free and the other three get 40 points for the first trick and 30 points for the other two. That is 100 points.

^b@2^*BPartscore^*N: When the pair commits to a contract which makes less than 100 it is called partscore. Contracts less than 5@C, 5@D, 4@H, 4@S, and 3N are partscores. The least commitment is 7 tricks in either suits or in NT.

^*BOvertrick(s)^*N and ^*BUndertricks^*N: The declaring side, on occasions, may make one or more tricks above the original commitment. The value of each additional trick is added to the final result. Conversely, the declaring side may fail to make the required number of tricks. The number of tricks by which they fail is the undertricks. For example, if they take 7 tricks in 3NT, the undertrick count is 2.

^*BVulnerability^*N: A key feature of duplicate bridge is the concept of vulnerability. Unlike rubber bridge, it is pre-determined depending only on the number of boards played. Vulnerability changes from board to board. One side will find its partnership vulnerable about 50 percent of the time. Sometimes neither partnership will be vulnerable; sometimes both will be vulnerable. This rotation is repeated every 4 boards. Vulnerability has significant impact on scoring and becomes an important factor in one's bidding and play strategies.

^*BGame or Bonus Points^*N: The declaring side in addition to the total points for the tricks they made, receive additional points according to the following chart: 
^C@2For a partscore ^g= 50 points
 ^cFor a game ^g= 300 points (non-vulnerable) / 500 points (vulnerable). If you bid and make game, you do not get the partscore bonus as well. 
 For small slam ^g= 500 points (non-vulnerable) / 750 (vulnerable) 
 For grand slam ^g= 1000 points (none-vulnerable) / 1500 (vulnerable).

^-|fp||ht|b|va|6|at|^B@2^Z@3^*BContract bridge^*N: Contract bridge, or simply bridge, is a trick-taking game using a standard 52-card deck. It is played by four players in two competing partnerships, with partners sitting opposite each other around a table. Contract bridge gets its name from the fact that on each hand one side enters into a "contract" to take a certain ## of tricks.

^*BDuplicate Bridge^*N: Is a form of contract bridge in which the same hands are played successively by different partnerships. In duplicate bridge, a player normally plays with the same partner (^*BPair Games^*N).

^*BIndividual event^*N: In an individual event, each player is paired with a different partner in each round. Individual events are less popular and much less common than pairs and teams events.

^*BPairs Game^*N: In a pairs game, every pair plays against a number of opposing pairs in successive rounds, depending on the size of the field. The pairs moving from table to table (two pairs for each table) is pre-determined by the number of pairs playing the event. Events with less than 7 tables are usually played as a Mitchell movement. Each North/South pair, while sitting on the same table, plays against all or most East/West pairs who are moving. The usual form of scoring for a pairs tournament is either ^*BMatchpoint^*N or ^*BIMP^*N scoring.

^*BTeams Game^*N: In a Team Tournament, two pairs constitute a team. If there are just two teams, they compete using two tables and having one pair from each team seated at each table, in opposite directions. Teams game are played either as "Swiss teams" or as "knockout events." For Teams Game is IMP scoring is used.

^c@2^*BSwiss Teams^*N: In Swiss events teams (four players in each team) play short matches, usually of seven boards. After seven boards points are converted to IMP using Standard IMP Table, a winner or tie determined and results turned in. The director keeps tabulations of the results and matches teams with similar records for the subsequent round.
|VA|4|at|^c@2^*BKnockout Teams^*N: In this form of scoring two teams play an extended match. At the end of the match points are converted to IMP using Standard IMP Table. Team with the most IMPs wins and goes on to the next round of play. The losing team is eliminated from further competition.

^-|fp||ht|b|va|6|at|^B@2^Z@3^*BInternational Match Points (IMPs) Scoring^*N: International Match Points (IMPs) is the primary method of scoring in team events such as ^*BSwiss Teams^*N, ^*BKnockout Teams^*N, and ^*BIMP Scored Pairs^*N.

In Team Matches (Swiss Teams and Knockout Teams), first we calculate the difference in score points per deal. For example:

On the first deal, at table 1 (NS team A) bid and make a vulnerable 3NT contract with one overtrick for +630 to team A.

At table 2 (EW team A) defeat the 3NT contract of team B's NS-pair by one trick for +100 to team A.

Therefore, on first deal team A scores +730 points and team B -730.
This number (730) is converted to IMP's, using International Matchpoints Scale see Appendix A. So team A scores +12 IMP on this deal, team B -12 IMP.

Contrary to MP scoring there are no extra points awarded for additional 10 score point difference. Therefore, 3NT+1 at 630 points scores no better than 4@H/@S at 620 points.

Note too that in International Matchpoints Scale the bigger the score point difference, the wider the range of the corresponding IMP score. For instance: 20 - 40 = 1 IMP while 1500 - 1740 = 17 IMP.

Suppose that after 12 deals have been played team A turns out to have won 54 IMP's and lost 37 IMP's. Team A has therefore won by 54-37 IMP's (and team B lost by 37-54 IMP's). The difference is 17 IMP's. 

Victory Points is the scoring method favored by many experts in contests where there are many teams and each team plays a relatively small number of deals against each of the other teams. When using victory Point scoring, the IMP score on each board is calculated. The total IMP score on the boards of the match are then converted to Victory Points in accordance with a predetermined scale.

^-|fp||ht|b|va|6|at|^B@2^Z@3^*BIMP Pairs Cross Scoring^*N: Is a pairs game (used at BBO) with a standard duplicate movement. At the end of the game the total scores for each board are averaged either by Butler method or by Cross-IMP. Each team's individual score is compared to the average. IMPs are awarded or subtracted from a pairs total based on how much over or under average their score is. High IMPs score wins.|

With the help of computers the Cross-IMP scoring is the mainstream now. In Cross-IMP your score on any particular board is compared with those of every other pair sitting in the opposite direction to you, across the field. Using the IMP chart the point difference in each comparison is converted to IMP. The total of these comparisons in IMPs is averaged to give you your score on that board.

Steps of using this technique are: 
1) Every score on any particular board is compared against every other score for the respective pair. In other words, for every score, the scores of the opponents are subtracted.
2) The subtracted results are converted in IMPs by using INTERNATIONAL MATCH POINT SCALE.
3) Using INTERNATIONAL MATCH POINT SCALE convert the point differences to IMPs.
4) Average the IMPs which is the score for that pair.

In step (1) Let’s assume we have a board played 4 times and the following are the results:
NS pair 1: 430
NS pair 2: 400
NS pair 3: 150
NS pair 4: -50|

^-|fp||ht|b|va|6|at|^B@2^Z@3In step (2) subtract each three opponents’ scores from the NS pair 1’s score as it was a team match:
A. NS pair 1 score vs NS pair 2 ---> 430 – 400 = 30
B. NS pair 1 score vs NS pair 3 ---> 430 – 150 =280
C. NS pair 1 score vs NS pair 4 ---> 430- (-50) = 480
                
In step (3) convert the subtractions in IMPs:
For A 30 we have 1 IMP
For B 280 we have 7 IMPs
For C 480 we have 10 IMPs

For step (4) sum the IMPs up and divide them by the number of opponents (3 here) and the result for the NS pair 1 is (1+7+10)/3 = 6 IMPs. The EW pair 1, who played this board on the same table with NS pair 1, will receive -6 IMPs accordingly.

Using the same steps the IMP scoring is done for all of the other pairs as shown below:

NS pair 2: ^eA. NS pair 2 score vs NS pair 1 ---> 400 - 430  = - 30 -1 IMPs
^eB. NS pair 2 score vs NS pair 3 ---> 400- 150   = 250   6 IMPs 
^eC. NS pair 2 score vs NS pair 4 ---> 400- (-50) = 450   10 IMPs
NS pair 2 receives (-1+ 6+ 10)/3 = 5  IMPs

NS pair 3:  ^eA. NS pair 3 score vs NS pair 1 ---> 150-430 = -280 -7 IMPs
^eB. NS pair 3 score vs NS pair 2 ---> 150-400 = -250 -6 IMPs
^eC. NS pair 3 score vs NS pair 4 ---> 150-(-50)= 200  5 IMPs
NS pair 3 receives [(-7-6)+5] = -8/3= -2.66 IMPs

NS pair 4: ^eA. NS pair 4 score vs NS pair 1 ---> -50 -430= -480 = -10 IMPs
^eB. NS pair 4 score vs NS pair 2 ---> -50 -400= -450 = -10 IMPs
^eC. NS pair 4 score vs NS pair 3 ---> -50 -150= -200 = -5 IMPs  
NS pair 4 receives (-10 -10-5)/3  = -8.33 IMPs

^-|fp||ht|b|va|6|at|^B@2^Z@3^*BMatchpoints^*N: In Matchpoints scoring, your partnership (a pair) is compared to the other pairs that play the same boards. You receive 1 MP for every pair that you beat and 1/2 MP for every pair that you tie on a given board. No points if none of those. Of course this is only if you play on a two table tournament which is rare. But, when there are more tables there would be more pairs to beat and the awarded MPs will go up. For example in the a recent tournament in a San Diego Bridge Club at |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.adventuresinbridge.com/hands/130122c.htm^*N|CP||AT| 27 boards were played by nine (9) N/S and nine (9) E/W pairs at nine tables. There were no complications such as missed played board, sitouts, and revokes—those are too complicated and outside the scope of this presentation. For each board the available maximum MPs for a player with best result, when it beats the other eight pairs, is P-1 (8 MP here). P is the number of pairs. Currently, clubs use handheld wireless instruments. At each table North enters the required information after each board and the rest is done by the central computer. Below is the actual result for board 3 in our example.

In board 3, |CP|8|AT|N/S pair 5|CP||AT| bid and made 4@S for 420 points which beats all the other eight N/S pairs. Therefore, the pair is awarded 8 MPs. N/S pair 6, however, has the next best result (150 points) which beats the other seven N/S pairs so that pair gets 7 MPs. On the other hand, N/S pairs 8 and 7 are tied and beat everyone else except N/S pairs 5 and 6. So They get 5.5 MPs (1 for each pairs they beat + 0.5 for the pair they tied). N/S pair 2 got beat by every one by bidding 3N and going down 3 for a -150 and get zero MP. The same process holds for E/W pairs. |CP|8|AT|E/W pair 3|CP||AT| get the top award of 8 MPs because they beat every E/W pair. 216 MPs (27 boards x 8 MPs) is the maximum any pair could theoretically win (if they got a top on every board). As you will see next that number is used to get the percentage scoring for each pair. |

In Board 1 shown above |CP|8|AT|N/S|cp||at| pair ##7 gets no MP—got beat by the other eight N/S pairs. N/S pair ##6 only did better than one pair and gets 1 MP. The other seven pairs received 5 MPs because they tied 6 other pairs, giving them 3 MPs (6 x .5 = 3) and beat 2 pairs;  3 + 2 = 5.   
      
Total MPs earned by each pair is totaled at the completion of the tournament. The table below left is the final result for N/S pairs and for E/W data is below right. 216 MPs were available for each side—8 MPs per board x 27 boards = 216.

In most ACBL sanctioned tournaments either are open or restricted based by the number of Master Points the players have. Explaining those are outside the scope of this presentation.

Further, the example tournament used here was a clean one as there were no sitouts, revokes, all players played at all tables, and there were no averages. However, Neuberg formula is used to fairly adjusting MP scores in one of the above circumstances occurs. Discussion of Neuberg formula is outside the scope of this presentation. However, if interested you can refer to this |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/81xg5w^*N|CP||AT| link for a good summary. Also at this |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/n4xg5w^*N|CP||AT| link you will find a fascinating discussion on the formula. Good luck.|

In real world, however, no one pays attention to all the above calculations. All they are interested is how they did in each board and what the final result is. Currently most clubs have wireless scoring tools on each table to calculate all the scoring and give instant results. In BBO you do not have to even bother with that much. However, I am a sucker to know what is under the hood no mater what car I am driving. If you are like me then look into many resources which provided at the end of his presentation.|

^-|fp||ht|b|va|6|at|^B@2^Z@3^*BPassed Hand and the Scoring^*N: Passing out the hand is a perfectly valid way to play it making it identical to a hand with a 0 raw score for both side. The usual rules for converting score to Matchpoints (or team IMPs, if you use those) apply if some tables play the hand. and score highly where others just don't play it since they all passed. Depending on the result from the other pairs who played the hand, the pair who passed the hand may get a higher or a lower sore than 0 raw score. It is permissible to re-shuffle the hand only in a friendly matches and if the hand has not been played before.|

}|CP||ht|d|cp|8|AT|^o@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Victory points are a method of determining the winner of a team event where each team plays the same number of matches. (A complete 20 point Victory Point scale for a 7 board match is on the left.)The most common event of this type is Swiss Teams, where each team plays 7 matches each consisting of 7 boards. |

Victory points are used to determine overall places. They work as follows:
The IMP margin of victory is calculated for a given match.

That margin of victory is used to distribute victory points (typically 20 total victory points) between the 2 teams. The closer the match, the more evenly the points are distributed. |

For example, in a tie match, each team would get 10 victory points. If a team won by 10 IMPS, the winning team would get 14 victory points and the losing team 6 victory points. If a team won by 28 IMPS, the winners would get 20 victory points and the losers 0 victory points.|

The total number of victory points for a team is used to determine that team's rank in the event.|
