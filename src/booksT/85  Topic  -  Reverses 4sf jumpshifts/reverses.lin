HT|b|va|5|cp||FP||at|^b@2^z@3This tutorial is on Reverse bids and how to respond to them based on Howard Schutzman's style. To be even handed there are review of styles played by other experts. To better understand this topic, however, we need a basic understanding of constructive bidding. To that end please review Howard's lesson on Introduction to Constructive Bidding. It is available at this |CP|1|AT|^*Htinyurl.com/l7vqrau^*N|CP||AT| link from his web site or from the BIL library.

Because this a large presentation, the content is divided in "Must Read" and "Optional" sections. The "Must Read" section has the most important part and the other section covers material "good to know." Please note, this is merely a tutorial where we have focused on main stream. The esoteric points are not included. As usual you can view the tutorial by continuously clicking the forward arrow or pick and click a topic from the table of contents below. ^*UAll blue texts are hyperlinks.^*N Also, after finishing a chapter you can click the |CP|1|AT|RETURN |CP||AT|which will bring you to this page if do not wish to continue with the next section.|qx|B, beginning|

qx|A1,what is a reverse|cs|1|fp|1|cp|4|ht|a|at|^-{          What is a Reverse Bid         }
^-|cp||cs||fp||at|^b@2There are several definitions for a reverse bid. One definition is:|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT| 
"A reverse is a non jump bid in a suit that forces partner to take a preference to the first suit at a high level."|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|

Larry Cohen describes a reverse bid as, "A non jump bid by opener at the two-level in a new suit that ranks higher than the suit opener bid first." |
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|

Howard Schutzman describes a reverse bid as, "A reverse is when a player ^*Bvoluntarily^*N bypasses his first suit at the 2-level to bid a second suit. "|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


AT|

^*BVoluntarily^*N" is an important distinction. For example in the following auction.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


HT|k|cs|6|at|^b{|ia|,,,1cp1sp!2h|at|}|ht|p|at|^b@22@H by opener is a reverse. Opener voluntarily 
bypassed clubs at the 2 level.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT| |
HT|k|cs|6|at|^o{|ia|,,,1cp1s2d!2h|at|}|ht|p|at|^o@22@H here, however, is not a reverse because the 2@C is no longer available for opener to bid if so he elects.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


ht|r|at|^b{|ia|,,,1SP2Hp!3C|at|}|ht|r|at|^o@23@C is also a reverse. We also prefer Howard's definition as we do not have to worry about the so called "high reverse" when opener's rebid is lower ranking than his first suit, but at the three level.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


%%%%%<<<<
ht|w|at|^b{|ia|,,,1hP2cp2s|at|}|ht|w|at|^m@2Despite the 2 over 1 bid by responder, 2@S is still a reverse. Responder must bid 3@D to return to diamonds. We have more examples next.|

^-|FP||CP||HT|c|cs|6|at|^b{|ia|,,,1hP2dp3c|at|}|ht|h|at|^B@23@C is a reverse–"high reverse." 
Responder must bid 3@H to return to hearts.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


ht|C|at|^n{|ia|,,,1CP1HP1S|at|}|ht|h|at|^n@21@S is not a reverse. Responder can bid 2@C to return to clubs.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


ht|j|at|^b{|ia|,,,1sp2dp2n|at|}|ht|O|at|^B@22NT is not a reverse. Although responder must bid 3@S
to return to spades, opener can only reverse
by bidding a new suit.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


ht|J|at|^N{|ia|,,,1dP1S2c2H|at|}|ht|O|at|^N@2Most people play that 2@H is still a reverse and shows extra values in this auction, despite the interference.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


ht|R|at|^b{|ia|,,,1dP1hp2s|at|}|ht|W|at|^b@22@S is not a reverse. Opener made a jump bid of
a new suit (opener bypassed 1@S). This is a
jump shift, and shows different values than a reverse.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


ht|R|at|^N{|ia|,,,1C1SXP2H|at|}|ht|W|at|^N@22@H is not a reverse. You are simply "raising" partner's hearts (responder's negative double promises hearts). This is essentially the same auction as 1@C-P-1@H-P-2@H. Opener must bid 3@H to show extra strength.|

^-|FP||CP||HT|d|cs|6|at|^-{|ia|,,,1C1SXP2D|at|}
^-|ht|i|at|^B@2This action is an issue of style. Some people do play that the negative double by North promises diamonds, in which case this is not a reverse, simply a diamond raise, using the same logic as in the previous example. However, more typically, the negative double simply promises hearts and says nothing about diamonds. Therefore, it is reasonable to play the 2@D bid shows extra values, because this auction is essentially the same as|

^-|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


ht|R|at|^B@2Howard says, "I personally play that the 2@D bid does not show extra values. Partner often has diamonds and will pass. With no diamond support, partner rates to be able to comfortably bid over 2@D, either by bidding 2@H to show a weak hand with long hearts, or by being able to show a preference for opener's 5+ card club suit by bidding 3@C." |

cs|1|fp|1|cp|4|ht|a|at|^-{          What is a Reverse Bid         }
^-|cp||cs||fp||ht|c|at|^b@2A reverse bid also has the following important features:|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


cs|6|AT|

{  Opener opens one of any suit (except spades).  }|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


AT|

{  The first suit bid is longer than the second suit bid (5+/4+ length). Some partnership may not reverse with 5-5 suits.  }|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


AT|

{  The second suit (see exception on previous page) has a higher rank than the first suit bid.  }|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


AT|

{  It shows either a medium or maximum opener ( we will discuss it more later ).  }|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


AT|

{  Opener's reverse is one round forcing.  }|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


AT|

{  In 2/1 the reverse bid by opener for many experts (Mike Lawrence followers) must show extra value.  
  Many other experts including Howard Schutzman play it does not show extra values.  }|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


cp||cs||va|6|AT|

BTW, Howard says, "When responder reverses, his second suit is almost always exactly 4 cards in length. Opener may very occasionally reverse with a 5-6 hand, but they are so rare that it is reasonable for responder to assume that opener's 2nd suit is only 4 cards in length. Responder should disregard his initial assumption of a 4-card 2nd suit ^*Bonly^*N if subsequent bidding establishes the second suit as 5+ cards. There is a common misconception that, even with a balanced hand, you should reverse to show your strength. For the following reasons that is not true. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


ht|t|cs|6|at|^b{|ia|,,,1n|at|}|ht|w|at|^b@2With a balanced 15-17, the opening bid would
have been 1NT. |
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


ht|t|at|^m{|ia|,,,1DP1SP2N|at|}|ht|y|at|^m@2With a balanced 18-19, opener must rebid 2NT. Note that in this auction 2NT does not deny a 4 card major. Here, opener could easily have a 4-card heart suit." |
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||
cs|1|fp|1|cp|4|ht|a|at|^-{          What is a Reverse Bid         }
^-|cp||cs||fp||ht|c|at|^b@2"So remember – a reverse always show an unbalanced hand where opener's first suit is longer than his or her second suit. The only time opener has more than 4 cards in the 2nd suit is with a very unbalanced hand (such as 5-6). Those hands are pretty rare, which is why I said opener's 2nd suit is almost always a 4-card suit. BTW, bidding 5-6 hands is a separate issue which outside the scope of this presentation."|

^-|fp||cs|6|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Reverses are one of the most confusing bidding concepts. A reverse is not limited to 15-18 (or some similar range). It shows either a medium or maximum opener. So if the auction goes, for example,|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


ht|e|at|^B{|ia|,,,1CP1SP2H|at|}|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


ht|e|at|^m@2opener can have as much as 19 or 20 points (or as little as 15 or 16). Assuming you have the appropriate suits, you reverse with a hand that contains jump shift points (18+). So the auction 1@C-P-1@S-P-3@H basically does not exist.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


ht|j|AT|^B@2A jump shift, on the other hand, guarantees a maximum opener (18+) and establishes a game force. Whether you jump shift or reverse with a maximum hand depends on the suits you hold and how the auction proceeds. For example, say you have a hand with 5 clubs, 4 hearts, and 18+. If it goes,| 
ht|m|at|^B{|ia|,,,1CP1DP2h|at|}|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NLet us restate "Reverses are one of the most confusing bidding concepts." This variation of point ranges make responder's life difficult in how to bid after partner's reverse bid. Next we will review several examples suitable for a reverse bids from Howard's mentoring sessions.|

This late raise shows 3-card spade support and partner should know that you cannot have more than one heart (you've shown 9 cards in clubs and diamonds and 3 cards in spades).|

With this maximum opener you bid 3@D which is a 3-level or high-level reverse. It is a game force and usually promises a 5/5 in the twos suits bid.|

lb|*bWhat should be your bid?^^2s|NT|^B@2
You should reverse in 2@S forcing partner to bid.|MB|2sp|
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You will rebid the spade suit to show extra length in that suit (6 hearts and 5 spades). The 2@S bid does not guarantee 5 spades. In fact, it is often done with 4 spades and a max opener, just to keep the bidding open and see what responder does next. This information will help partner to choose what the trump suit should be.|

Although 2@H is a possible bid and it does describe your hand, 2N is a more precise description. 2N is a more precise description of your hand, guaranteeing more HCP (18-19), a stopper in diamonds, and is game force although responder (very rarely) will pass with 4-5 points.|MB|2N|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Let's count North's points. She has 19 HCP, has 2 length points, and has 1 quality suit point for 22 points. She should subtracts 2 for the 2 Qx suits—dubious doubletons, getting back down to 20 Starting Points. With 20 points, she has a game forcing hand. 3@S is not game forcing. I can, and often do pass that bid. |
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Also, her spade suit is "self sufficient." That means that it passes the "singleton test." If a suit is a reasonable trump suit when partner has a singleton, then it is self sufficient. So she has a clear 4@S bid. |
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Usually responder is "captain", meaning responder is responsible for placing the final contract. But when you open with a maximum hand (18+) and responder shows 6 or more then opener becomes captain, and must ensure the partnership gets to game. |
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|In such circumstances opener must make a forcing bid or bid game. Jumping to 3 is not a forcing bid, it only shows a medium hand. |
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Opener has 2 rebids available that are forcing—^*Bjump shifts^*N and ^*Breverses^*N. A jump shift (e.g. 1C-P-1H-P-2S) shows a max (18+) opener and establishes a game force; the partnership may not stop below game.  A reverse (e.g. 1@C-P-1@S-P-2@H) shows a medium or max hand (16+) and is a one round force, not a game force; if opener ^*Breverses^*N with a maximum hand, opener is still responsible for getting their side to game.|mb|4S|

NT||

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, please note that 4@S is not a "shut out bid". It shows a self-sufficient spade suit and game-forcing values (19+). Responder is not required to pass. With 12+ points, responder should look for slam.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|In SAYC, 3@C would be a reverse. Some teachers call that a "high reverse", because it was done at the 3 level. It is a reverse because partner bypassed her first suit to bid a 2nd suit. It shows at least 16 or so points. In 2/1 the meaning depends on partnership agreement. Some people play it shows extra values anyway, to make it easier to get to some slams. Others play it simply is bidding out your distribution. You just need to agree. I would say the more common treatment is it does not necessarily show extra values in 2/1.|

^-|cp||cs||fp||at|^b@2
Any Reverse bids tutorial without explaining a Jump-shift by opener is not complete. Larry Cohen says, "It continually amazes me how many "intermediate" players have been improperly taught (or improperly remember) this topic."
Opener's Strong Jump Shift is defined as a single jump bid in a rank higher than both responder's and opener's initial suit rank, promising 19-21 distribution points. It is forcing to game except 2N jump shift. Let us look at a few examples.|

qx|SAYC,|cs|1|cp|1|fp|1|HT|b|at|^-Reverse Bids in SAYC and 2/1
^-|HT|C|cp||FP||at|^b@2^z@3The meaning of reverses varies depending on whether or not you are playing 2/1 or not. Let's take the auction 
1@H - P - 2@C - P
2@S|
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


AT|

If playing SAYC, the 2@C bid is not a game force. But it does show at least a medium hand (10+). And the 2@S reverse shows at least a medium opener (15+). So the partnership is now in a game forcing auction because a medium opener opposite a medium response means you have enough points to be in game (25+).|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


AT|

If playing 2/1, the 2@C bid is a game force. The only question is, does the reverse still show extra values? This is something each partnership has to decide. Either, according to Howard, "is fine. You can decide the 2@S bid is simply 'bidding out opener's shape', showing 5+ hearts and 4 spades, and does not show anything extra. I think this is what a majority of experts play these days. Or you could decide that 2@S still shows extra values (15+), to make it easier to get to slam. Hands where each partner has around 16 points are hard to bid; the partnership has the values for a slam, but it is often hard for each partner to communicate they have 16ish points. I now play that 2@S does not show extra values, but I used to play that it does and I have no strong preference either way."|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


AT|

When opener's bid is a "high reverse" (e.g opener's 2nd bid was at the 3-level). In SAYC, this is still a reverse and establishes a game force. However, in 2/1 this is can be a problematical bid. You are taking up a lot of extra room, so your partnership should have a precise meaning for the bid.|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


AT|

Bergen recommends (and I now play it) that if opener's 2nd bid is at the 3-level after a 2/1 response, that shows either a 5-card suit or a quality 4-card suit. With a mediocre 4-card suit opener should rebid something else (usually 2NT). Another alternative is that the high reverse does show extra values, 15+.|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


AT|

"Many also play the 2/1 system with the same reverse agreement. Others do not, advocating opener's rebids are shape-showing; using that agreement, a suit rebid tends to show 6 trump and a 2 Notrump bid shows a balanced hand with stoppers."|

^-|cp||cs||fp||va|2|AT|^B@2Responding to reverse bids is difficult because a reverse can be made with a hand holding 15/16 to 18+ points (a medium or a maximum opener) and is one round forcing.

The following table summarizes how the partnership can tell whether or not they have enough points to bid game:

Minimum               No           No           Yes

Maximum              Yes          Yes          Yes

As you note if responder has a minimum hand game is possible if opener has a maximum hand. But opener can make a reverse bid with a medium hand. Therefore they need to exchange information to avoid getting into an unmakable contact.|

^B@2Generally, Reverse bids fall in medium and maximum range but responder does not know which one. So, with a minimum or even with a medium strength hand, responder needs more information from the Reverse bidder in reaching game or stopping below game. That is THE problem. Several treatments are proposed to handle this problem. In the next section Howard explains his approach for responding to reverse bids during his mentoring session of October 3, 2013. Afterward, we fully outline his approach and briefly explain other more common approaches.

^-|cp||cs||fp||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|This is the area where many partnerships, even experienced ones, have the most difficulty. Let me explain. In most auctions, one person takes charge (most often the responder), and drives the partnership to the appropriate contract. However, with reverse auctions, there is a lot of ambiguity regarding whether or not the partnership should be in game, and who is in charge. If the responder has 9+ points, then he or she needs to take charge to make sure the partnership gets to game. If the opener has a very good hand (18+), then he or she needs to take charge and make sure game is bid. However, when neither partner has game forcing values, or both partners have game forcing values, the auction can get confusing. And there is no universal agreement on how to handle this problem.|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |

At the risk of sounding immodest, I think my approach really solves the problem in most cases.  It is simple, effective, easy to understand and apply. I think if we focused on my approach, that would be best for most bridge students. I know this tutorial intends to be "fair and balanced" and present other points of view. But focusing on my approach, I think, might make things less confusing. So let tell you what I recommend.|
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


AT|

a) First of all, what are responder's obligations when opener makes a reverse bid? The simplest way to play is that it is a one round force for responder. Responder must make one more bid. Some people also play that the auction cannot stop below 2NT. That is a reasonable way to play, as it gives more flexibility in some auctions, but is not crucial.|
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


AT|
 
b) With non-game forcing values (less than 9 points), make one of the following bids (all of which are not forcing, and can be passed). 
^Ci. Show a preference for one of opener's suits. An example auction is 1@D-P-1@S-P-2@H-P-3@D. 
^Cii. Rebid responder's suit. An example auction is 1@C-P-1@S-P-2@D-P-2@S 
^Ciii. Rebid 2NT, showing at least somewhat of a stopper in the 4th suit. An example auction is 1@C-P-1@S-P-2@H-P-2NT.|
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


AT|

^Bc) With game forcing values (9 or more points): 
^Ci. Jump to game in one of opener's suits. An example auction is 1@D-P-1@S-P-2@H-P-4@H. 
^Cii. Bid 3NT with stoppers in the 4th suit. An example auction is 1@C-P-1@S-P-2@H-P-3NT. 
^Ciii. Bid the 4th suit as an artificial bid to establish a game force. An example auction is 1@C-P-1@S-P-2@D-P-2@H.|

^-|cp||cs||fp||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|The key thing to remember is that if, as responder you have a game forcing hand, you must make a bid that communicates that to opener. The only non-game bid that is forcing is the 4th suit. If you make any other non-game bid, opener can pass. |
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


AT|

While it is true that, occasionally, bidding the 4th suit makes the auction difficult (particularly if it is a major at the 3-level), my experience is that this approach is simple, unambiguous, and works very well on most hands. It pretty much always gets you to a reasonable contract.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NWe are going to present Howard's approach in more detail later. First, you can join him during one of his recent mentoring session where he is enplaning his approach. Then, we present several auctions detailing responder's option, based on Howard's approach, without showing any hands. And finally, you will see responder's hand, the auction with a reverse bid by the opener, and you can bid it using Howard's approach.

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss the 2N by Anna. I am not going to explain whether it is or it is not a correct bid for her hand. As you may know there are several treatments for responding to reverse bids. In most 2N is used to get more information from the Reverse bidder. They are not universal, they are complicated, and hard to remember for most bridge players. Here, let me briefly discuss my method of responding once opener reverses.|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


AT| First let me give Anna an undo.|ub||
pg| ***** 157 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Some people play a fairly complicated system convention called Ingberman. It resembles Lebensohl, which is one of the most complicated conventions there is. That is why I recommend against playing it.|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|The problem with reverse auctions is, often it is not clear to responder whether or not their side should be in game. Reverse bidder, me in this deal, can have as little as 16 and responder, Anna here, can have as little as 6. But I can have 18 or more, or Anna could have 10 or more. So it is difficult, without some sort of agreements, to decide whether or not to be in game. |
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Ingberman convention tries to solve the problem as follows. If responder bids 2N (as a relay), Reverse bidder is required to bid 3@C with a minimum reverse hand (16-bad 18). After bids 3@C by Reverse bidder, responder is responsible for placing the contract.|
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|There are a lot of problems with that approach in my opinion. So I suggest you adopt the approach I play, which I think makes bidding much easier. There are no "relays" in my approach.|
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|If responder has a game forcing hand, she bids 4th Suit Forcing. In this case for example, if Anna decided she had a game force she could bid 2@H (4th Suit) to establish a game force. Any other bid by Anna does not establish a game force, and is assumed by Reverse bidder to show less than a game force. Then the Reverse bidder is in charge to set the contract.|
PG| ***** 162 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|I do have another rule to give the auction a little more flexibility. That rule is that the partnership cannot stop below 2N. So if Anna bids, for example, 2@S over 2@D, she is not establishing a game force, but it is still forcing because her bid is below 2N. |
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Again the two rules for responder, when her/his had is stronger than a minimum, are:
a) 4th Suit establishes a game force
b) the partnership cannot stop below 2N.|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Other than 4th Suit, in my system, all other bids are natural. If Anna bids anything else (say 3@C or 3@D) that shows less than a game force. Note the 3@C and 3@D are above 2N. 2@S would show 5 spades. |
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|If Anna does not establish a game force, then opener, with 18+, becomes captain and is responsible for getting to game. In effect 2N becomes responder's "minimum" second bid instead of an Ingberman relay and it should show a stopper in the unbid suit.|
PG| ***** 166 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|I have used this approach quite successfully for many years. I am not sure why more people don't play it. In this example, Anna has a borderline hand. Its not clear whether or not she has a game force. Personally, with 2 aces, I would call her hand a game force and she can bid 2@H (4th Suit).|

The 4th Suit and 2N bids are our main tools in responding to 2-level reverse bids using Howard's method. As responder, you are sitting South and need to respond to opener's reverse bid.

^-{          Responding to Reverse Bids - Other Styles         }
^-|cp||cs||fp||AT|^B@2^Z@3^*BMM: ^*NHoward has repeatedly mentioned that bidding Reverses and responding to them is complicated and even top experts can screw it up. However, I learned that lesson the hard way when I tried to cover the responding part for this tutorial. As we mentioned earlier the big problem is when responder has a minimum or low medium strength hand.|
PG| ***** 211 ***** |


AT|

Lebensohl, Traditional, Ingberman, and Modified Ingberman approaches are to name a few. Allegedly, they are all devised so responder with a minimum or a medium hand can use in getting additional information from the reverse bidder. In all responder bids 2N or the cheaper of the 4th suit and 2N with a minimum hand and another suit with a medium hand. To add to the confusion, responder and reverse bidder should remember which bid by responder is forcing and which one is not. And if it is forcing, is it forcing to game or not. We wonder how an average bridge partnership can remember all those fine points.|
PG| ***** 212 ***** |

The big problem is so bad that a few experts in BBO Discussion Forums |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/jxwm9w^*N|CP||AT| wrote, "I do not like to bid a reverse." Well, it is likely that MM's shortcoming in English comprehension and/or bridge skill is the dominant factor here. Therefore, below we have the links to top writing on the topic. Please review ^*Ball^*N and inform us if you find a reasonable approach. |

ht|h|aT|^B@2Ingberman convention is useful when the partner reverses and the responder is holding minimum values of 6/7 HCP which from responder's perspective is insufficient to guarantee game as reverse bidder may have minimum values–15/16 HCP. Therefore, responder must communicate this information to his partner to partnership to stop below game after opener's 2-level reverse bid. The Ingberman convention is similar to Lebensohl in bidding 2N (relay to 3@C). However, in this convention, other bids are also defined so that it is more than Lebensohl after a reverse bid. First let us let us address the SAYC vs 2/1 issue and reverse bids such as the auction below left:|
PG| ***** 226 ***** |


HT|n|cs|6|at|^B{|ia|o1h2c2s?|at|}|HT|n|at|^K@2The initial 2@C by responder in SAYC promises 10+ HCP ( top of a medium range hand for responder) and at least game is assured. The responder's rebid is standard. The only issue which should be considered when partnership plays 2/1 is whether the reverse shows extra value or not. Otherwise, partnership at least is committed to game.|
PG| ***** 227 ***** |


ht|t|AT|^B@2In the next panel we will outline Ingberman convention only when the responder has shown minimum hand value. We will be using this
|HT|u|cs|6|at|^f{|ia|o1d1s2h?|at|}|ht|v|at|^n@2auction for illustration.|
