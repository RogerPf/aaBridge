^b@2djneill:  Welcome all to Standard Modern Precision

As I mentioned in the textbook, it's fun, effective, legal, and really going to be the standard for the future 
as far as precision in the States
Most of the top pros have at least one partnership in which they play this system
So it's nice to be able to learn a little about it.       You may even use it.

For today, North is the dealer
The two areas I will go over today are:

1) overview of the openings

2) 1@C-1@D continuations

In the future weeks we will look at all other parts of the system
To start, let's look at North (opener) hands


In precision we open ALL eleven's and many 10's
What this does is it allows us to open more frequently than most, and put pressure on the opponents.



(MM: None of the hands were saved, but Kerrie got me lots of screen shots to make this presentation
@h Thank you Kerrie @h
And CJ could provide what was still missing !!   TEAMWORK :)

nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psjt6hak64dq43cjt2|at|}


|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1dp|at|}|at|^b@2

North has the typical precision suit opening:  notice it is a bit light.  

You may be wondering why 1@d, why not 1@c ? 

In 2/1 and SAYC, the convenient minor is opened
Basically, if you would open a convenient minor, always open 1@d in precision (11-15 HCP)
The 1@c is reserved for ^*bstrong^*n hands
You say "may be short" when you open 1@d
It could be 2 cards

Precision is also a 5-card major system
So you should feel right at home coming from SAYC or 2/1
If you would open 1@h or 1@s in standard, and the hand is 11-15 HCP, 
you would open it just the same in precision.


Let's look at another 1@d opening|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2


|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psaj82hjt62dq5ckq6|at|}


|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1dp|at|}|at|^b@2


North again has a 1@d opening - this time just 2 diamonds
It is a very convenient minor
But you can see how 2 or 3 cards is very similar to many people who already open a short club.
It's not that revolutionary to open a short minor.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2


|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|ps7hqj42dakjt95cjt|at|}


|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1dp|at|}|at|^b@2


This time, North also opens 1@d
But it really has diamonds!
Just like in standard, if you have a long suit, you open it.
North plans on raising a heart response, or rebidding diamonds
just like in standard.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2


|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|ps5hkq84dq93ckqjt8|at|}


|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1dp|at|}|at|^b@2


This time North's longer suit is clubs by far
However, 1@d is still the opening



1@d is a very flexible opening.
You will open it a lot!
The idea is to prepare a search for a major fit.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

You might have @d and @c

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|ps8h2daqj842caq983|at|}


|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1dp|at|}|at|^b@2


Still you open 1@d
Of course you will rebid @c later to show both minors, just like in standard|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psj6ha985dt5cakt86|at|}


|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1dp|at|}|at|^b@2

- This time North has a 1@d opening again with longer @c
But North will prepare a 1NT rebid, not clubs 
- opening @d and rebidding clubs shows more minor cards than this - 
This is a balanced hand, so it will rebid 1NT|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2


|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psjt97hkdat75caqt5|at|}


|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1dp|at|}|at|^b@2


- This time, the 1@d opening has 3 suits
Notice you would open this 1@d in 2/1 or sayc too

The main difference between a sayc 1@d and precision 1@d is that precision 1@d could be short.
But it's very similar after that.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

Let's turn to the 1M (@h/@s) openings:  (11-15 HCP)

Again, 5-card majors, just like sayc and 2/1

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psakqj64hdt2cjt653|at|}


|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1sp|at|}|at|^b@2


You would open this in sayc 1@s
Same in precision
You do not have to alert this one|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psakqj64hdt2cjt653|at|}


|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1sp|at|}|at|^b@2


- North now has a 1@h
But notice it is just 11 HCP
I'm not sure all of us would open this at all in sayc or 2/1 

But precision allows you to open ALL 11's
It's more fun :-)
The opponents have to deal with this opening rather than a Pass|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|pst8haqt65dk95cq64|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1hp|at|}|at|^b@2


North again has a normal 1@h
I'll mention this is a maximum 1@h opening
Remember that the suit openings in precision are 11-15 HCP
This range gives us some immediately useful information|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|pskqt9862hk7cak98|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp|at|}|at|^b@2


- North has another 15, but this is a powerful hand
I would upgrade this to 1@c 

You have to alert 1@c
The 1@c is a stark departure from sayc and 2/1
Notice North can have longer spades than clubs
^*bThis is because 1@c says nothing about shape at all^*n

It's totally artificial
The definition of 1@c could be said to be:
^*b"wants to be in game opposite a random 8 HCP"^*n|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

Now some hands are "in between"....

^*uBalanced 14-16^*n

These hands open 1NT
This is ^*ba full HCP lighter^*n than your sayc or 2/1 1NT (15-17)
This is necessary because the openings are lighter by a HCP
So the NT range is pulled down.
What this does mean is you open 1NT a lot more often because 14 is more common than 17.
This also puts pressure on the opponents....
1NT is very difficult to contend with|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psak7hkj7d96ckj765|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1np|at|}|at|^b@2

Here's a typical 1NT opening
You have to announce the range when you make the bid (or in real life, your partner does)
Responding is easy
You just respond like a normal NT
Stayman, transfers
Nothing different, just remember opener is a bit lighter, so you need 1 more HCP to invite, bid game, etc

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psa963ha64dt532caq|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1np|at|}|at|^b@2

Here North has just 14 but that's enough for 1NT in precision.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psat32hat97d8ckq85|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p2dp|at|}|at|^b@2


The 2@d opening in precision is like mini roman
But it's ^*balways short in diamonds^*n
This time you REALLY are short!
It must be alerted.

(But there is another shape or two you can have, that mini roman will not have)|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|pskj72hkqtd2ckt652|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p2dp|at|}|at|^b@2

Here North has 4315 shape
Not really 3 suited, but kind of.
That also opens 2@d |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psaqj6hq982ca9653|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p2dp|at|}|at|^b@2

North may even be 4405, as here.  

The range is 11-15 HCP, just like other suit precision openings.
It's kind of a gadget to handle the hands that don't work anywhere else.

Opening 2@d is : ^*b4=4=1=4    4=4=0=5    4=3=1=5     or     3=4=1=5^*n     EXACTLY
So you can see that the opening helps partner immediately place the contract
often without asking any further.


The clubs we have neglected up til now.|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

Here is how you show 6+ clubs:
In sayc and 2/1, 2@c is artificial and BIG
But in precision it's just another natural bid.  (good 10-15 HCP)  NF
Like a strong weak two.


|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psjt54hdak6cqjt742|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p2cp|at|}|at|^b@2


But it can have a side suit, like here in spades|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psa8hqtd976caq9763|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p2cp|at|}|at|^b@2

North may be balanced tho
It just shows 6+@c's, 11-15 HCP
In sayc and 2/1 you would open 1@C and rebid 2@C
But here you accelerate the description

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psakj52h6djcaqt532|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p2cp|at|}|at|^b@2

It can even have.... a FIVE card major on the side
You hope to bid the major later|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

Ok so far all the openings have been somewhat natural, with 11-15 HCP
2@d excepted.
The 2@d opening has 0 or 1 diamonds
The 2@d opening never has 2 or more diamonds

It's time for the ^*ustrong hands^*n!
These are fun to announce (they are alertable)
You get to tell the world you have a good hand.

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psq872ha73dak7ca83|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp|at|}|at|^b@2

- This is a typical 1@c opening
A big balanced hand
1NT is 14-16, remember
This is just a hair too strong|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
- Here's another:

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psaqjhk72dqj863ca2|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp|at|}|at|^b@2



diamonds are longer than clubs, but that's ok, 1@c is artificial|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psakhakj8daj74ca63|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp|at|}|at|^b@2

There's no upper limit on the 1@c
I guess 37 is the most :-)
This hand is pretty good
You would open North's hand 2@c in SAYC or 2/1
But in precision you downsize that to 1@c
You plan on jumping in NT later to show this behemoth|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

Not all strong hands open 1@c - there is one:

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psq5ha842daq8cakq4|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p2np|at|}|at|^b@2

2NT opening is 20-21      Just like in sayc or 2/1
You should feel at home here.
You can use Puppet Stayman, or regular Stayman - transfers, etc     Nothing changes|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|pskj32hada3cakt985|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp|at|}|at|^b@2

- This hand actually has clubs!
But we won't really know that until later
1@c is artificial
The plan is to rebid the clubs at some point|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psqha6542dakj9cak64|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp|at|}|at|^b@2

- Here's a random hand with a 5-card major
The 1@c can be various hand shapes
It doesn't need to have clubs at all

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psak9765hkdkj973cq|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp|at|}|at|^b@2

Here it has just 1|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psahakqjt42d9cak62|at|}

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp|at|}|at|^b@2

This hand is almost a slam in hand
But you want to start slow with 1@c
In standard you would open 2@c
Same idea, just different bid

That's the overview of the hands for opening bids.|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


at|

realrowdy:  It seems to free up your bidding.
wyoming33: What if you have 5M and 5m do you then open the major? And why not the major when you had 5/6?
djneill:  Yes if you have 5M-5m you open the major (if 11-15 HCP)
Well, in precision, you take a gamble with 6-5's to always open the 6, and then catch up later in the 5

Somebody asked: - Is it HCP or distributional points?
The 11-15 is a guideline. Feel free to use your judgement with distribution, but we open ALL 11's
There is no 11 we do not open.

|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2


Redbird44:  Do you count quacks when opening light?
djneill:  Yes you count every HCP, even the quacks
Feel free to use judgement if your hand looks stinky, it probably is not worth opening.

But personally, I've opened all 11's and will continue
lots of 10's, some 9's!
Once even a 6 HCP hand but that was questionable :-)
wyoming33: We know you are aggressive Dan :)

djneill:  Well, 6-6 shape 6 HCP, I figure 6-6-6 is a special number
I would never open a 6 HCP hand unless I felt it was a freak of freaks

Precision lowers the bar though, enough to open light more often than in 2/1 or SAYC
And since the maximum is 15, partner will never take you for a monster,
so you can get away with a lot.



|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt||qx|jmps,T|cp|2|at|^b@2
I'll start on the 1@c - 1@d sequences:

The  ^*u1@d  response to  1@c^*n  shows 0-7 HCP, any distribution, just as artificial as 1@c was.
It's the ^*Bnegative.^*n
Kind of like a 2@d response to 2@c in 2/1 or SAYC   In that respect it is very similar.
It is not "waiting", it is actually promising ^*b0-7 HCP^*n
But 1@c was forcing!
You can't Pass it, unless you have peeked at all the cards
|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psaqha754d83cakt962|at|} 
|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|ps76hqt32dkt7cj754|at|}        |cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp1d|at|}|at|




So South with 0-7 HCP responds 1@d over 1@c
North's turn...    In this situation, the system is very ^*bMAFIA^*n
^*bMA^*njors ^*bFI^*nrst ^*bA^*nlways
The majors are what bridge is all about.
If you are going to bid a light game, it's in a major, not a minor
Majors score more at matchpoints than minors
You can score higher more easily at the 2-level in a major than 
at the 3-level in a minor!|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
Let's see how MAFIA works

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psaqha754d83cakt96|at|}   

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|ps76hqt32dkt7cj753|at|}    |cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp1dp1hp3h|at|}|at|^b@2



After 1@d, North has 4 hearts and 5 clubs.. According to MAFIA you always bid your major first.
Even with a longer minor, as here.     The idea is to uncover a heart fit quickly.
- Here South has a nice hand (4 trump support, a maximum for the 0-7 range, balanced)
          The system bid is 3@h

At this point, North knows there are 22-24 HCP total, with an 8 card major fit.
At IMPs, North might just take a stab
Since at IMPs, you can bid aggressive games and be rewarded handsomely
In sayc or 2/1, you might open North's hand 1NT (maybe) and you miss the major fit
That is part of the power of MAFIA
True you might open it 1@c in 2/1, but there is an advantage to opening 1NT too|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|ps65hak82daj6ckq74|at|}   |cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp1dp1np|at|}|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|pst832h765dqt97caj|at|}

In this case, North has a major...
But you might choose to rebid 1NT instead, which is 17-19 HCP
The advantage to rebidding 1NT is that you rightside the contract
Also, a 1@h rebid would be wide-range, and many shapes
1NT immediately limits the hand and distribution effectively.

^*uResponder can now bid Stayman and transfers as normal^*n

Here South has 7 HCP, North 17-19, so there are 24-26 HCP
I think South would bid Stayman and then raise to game, this time it's on a @d hook.
50% game is not too bad, and who knows, maybe the opponents will never lead spades, 
South having shown 4 spades..

So the 1@c-1@d-1NT are very easy hands to bid.
^*bYou just pretend opener has a 17-19 NT opening^*n, and bid Stayman and transfers.
This is very easy for a SAYC or 2/1 bidder to understand.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psa9hakq7daqjtcqjt|at|}    |cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp1dp2np3cp3hp3n|at|}|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psj642ht9d753ck763|at|}

- This time North has a VERY strong NT

In standard you would open 2@c and rebid 2NT
Almost the same, this time you open 1@c and rebid (jump)  2NT  (22-24)
And just like in standard, you can use Jacoby transfers and Stayman.
Again, very easy to understand.
The only difference was the 1@c-1@d start.

^*bThese NT rebids are limited and non-forcing.^*n
Responder is in control.
Responder can Pass these if weak.|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
Here's a hand where MAFIA works like a charm:
|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psa763haq862dj8cak|at|}

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|ps8542hj4dt93cq952|at|}      |cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp1dp1hp1sp2s|at|}|at|^b@2



1@h by North is forcing. It doesn't promise the world, but it allows you to creep up on a major fit.
In SAYC or 2/1 you bid "up the line",     Same in precision.

Now that South has shown 4 spades, North can raise to 2@s
South has just 3 HCP, quacks at that
So if North has a minimum 1@c opening, about 16-18, that's just 19-21 HCP total...
Not enough for game....   So South can Pass|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
It does take some basic math skills to use precision.
We'll see later how North can show VERY strong hands
|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|pst9hak98da32caq96|at|}

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psq8762hq632d98ct3|at|}     |cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp1dp1np2cp|at|}|at|^b@2



This time South has a weak hand opposite 17-19
But you can't keep a good man down
Garbage stayman!
South found a major fit after all
South had 9 cards in the majors, the chance of a good fit was pretty good 

So again, 1@c-1@d-1NT is 17-19, not forcing, and you use stayman/transfers

Now we get more interesting|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psahqj9652dackqj42|at|}

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|pskj9642h4dt94ct75|at|}     |cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp1dp1hp1sp2cp|at|}|at|^b@2

North of course MAFIA's 1@h
As you would in sayc or 2/1, North bids first one suit, then the other.
This 2@c limits North's hand to about 20-21 HCP at the most.
South has a 6th spade so can rebid those,   or Pass 2@c
It depends whether South wants to risk tempting North to bid higher.
After 2@s North sees a big misfit, and might just want to Pass this.
It's a close 5@c but in general, bidding for 11 tricks is difficult with just 20-23 HCP
North has a lot of losing hearts to take care of, and East is sitting there with them covered.
So stopping low has its merits in a misfit.

In sayc or 2/1, North would open 1@h. South might Pass, or respond 1@s or 2@s   (if weak jump shift)
So you get to the same place regardless.|

This time, North has no major, so North is free to rebid a minor (DENYING a Major)
Again this limits North's hand, South does not have to bid again.

South has 5 of the 0-7 HCP, so pretty good...Also, South has a fit for diamonds
South has 5-7 HCP for the free call over 2@d    (2@s or 3@d)

North knows there are 23-25 HCP total     Game might be there.
So North could try bidding a stopper with  3@s    hoping to get to 3NT

South has an unbalanced hand with 5 spades and a singleton - 3NT does not look right
South can try 4@s            and North can go back to 5@d
This plays pretty well, even with the @dK offside.|

nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

As Bergen often states, 9 trumps and a singleton you can basically write game into the scorepad.

...10 trumps here.

In standard, North might open 1@d, South respond 1@s, and North is stuck
Maybe North rebids 3@d, maybe 3@c
But it's tough for South to climb to game with such a bad hand

Precision allows North to calmly describe her hand and get to game
It adds some more wrinkles.|

This time North has a serious hand     South, not so much

The way North forces to game with a long minor and no major is to ^*ujump rebid^*n 

South cannot Pass this, as much as it pains her :-)
South's best shot here is to leave open the way to 3NT   (3@d waiting is an ok bid)

North can bid a stopper.
South has no stopper, so will use FAST ARRIVAL to get to 5@c

(notice East does not know about North's diamonds)|

This time North has a game forcing balanced hand.

So North shows the big GF balanced hand by ^*ujumping to 3NT^*n  (25-27)

1@c    ^d1@d
3NT = 25-27

I'm going to introduce a possible gadget you may choose to use  (the 2@h bid)

1@c   ^d1@d
2@h = "Kokish"
     ^d2@s = relay bid

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psj7hq9753dkt2cjt7|at|}

1@C - 1@d - 2NT would be about 22- to a bad 24
This hand is probably too strong for that.
The gadget I will introduce is called Kokish    (2@h = Kokish = GF with hearts   or  BIG  NT)

This way, North gets to show the big balanced GF hand at the level of 2NT
2@h forces south to bid 2@s          as a kind of relay
and North now rebids 2NT to show the BIG BALANCED game force  (good 24-27)
South can now use Stayman and transfers as normal in SAYC and 2/1

North showed about good 24-26 HCP
South has just 7 HCP, but the 9-card fit (north's jump to 4@h) means anything is possible.

In general, with a 9 card fit and 30 HCP you can investigate slam|

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|ps873ht965dj54ck97|at|}


- Here North has a multi-dimensional hand
I would suggest treating North's hand as balanced
The singleton honor acts as a doubleton of sorts
But I would discount it a bit, so instead of 22, I would call it 21
And South can choose to bid on or not 

It could be a close game

Next we will discuss some of the MAFIA continuations
As normal, North rebids the major with a major-minor, even if the minor is longer!|

^*uSouth has a special call now which shows a (5-7) with a   3-card raise  (2@d)^*n

Kind of like a support double.          I agree you will have to study this a bit.
It is not like SAYC or 2/1 at all.       
But it is like Drury
So it is a bit like something you may have seen before.
North has just 17 HCP with a stiff King.   Not what (5-7) and a 3-card support will get to game on.
So North can just sign off in 2@s

In SAYC or 2/1, North would open 1@s 
and South would either Pass or respond a forcing 1NT (too weak for a 2@s raise)
and N-S would alight in 2@s just the same probably. This actually comes close to making, maybe it does.
But you don't have to get to every game at matchpoints|

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psj53h942dt53c8643|at|}

- This time MAFIA again
1@c   1@d
1@s is forcing for one round
        1NT   (double negative)

So immediately North knows it's time to start running to find some fit.
2@c    pass

In this case, North's clubs could be longer than spades.
South is happy to find a "get out" and passes 2@c
So even though there is a 5-3 spade fit, South does not know if North has 4 or 5 spades
But South does know North has 4 or 5 clubs     (or more)    So the safest move is to Pass 2@c
At least there is an 8 card fit.

West has an interesting hand, in fact, one that would overcall over 1@d
However, I will go over interference in another lesson.     It's important :-)|

Now it's time for the "other" drury:

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|ps3hj865dq954ckj54|at|}

North MAFIA's with 1@s
^*uNow South can show 6-7 HCP WITHOUT a fit with 2@c^*n
It's kind of like a "non fit Drury"      but, it's 6-7, that's pretty good!

North can now see a game in the offing    North has just 16 HCP    but just about 3 losers
So 6-7 will do nicely, ^*uNorth can jump to 3@d to force to game with 5+ diamonds^*n
South can try 4@d (we are in a game force).   And North can try RKC!   alas, North settles for 5@d
If South had an Ace and the @dQ, there would be slam, or maybe even without the Queen

In standard, North would open 1@s, South would respond 1NT
North might rebid 3@d, and South is having problems imagining a game.
Precision makes it easier.|

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psjt852h743dq53ct8|at|}



Sometimes North has just a hand that wants to bid game and shut out everyone else.
But this hand by North is way too strong for a 4@s opening.
The solution is to open 1@c, and THEN bid 4@s

North does not really care about South's hand.   It's a gamble
In this case, South's @dQ is well placed and it comes in.|

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp1dp3nppp|at|}|at|^b@2

This time North is in a different sort of gamble
North has a "strong" version of the gambling 3NT

This is where the Kokish I talked about earlier helps.
If you use 1@c-1@d-2@h for all GF balanced hands
It leaves free 1@c-1@d-3NT for the gambles.

North has 8 tricks in hand, and random honors in the majors
Anything might let this make.|

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|ps6h642dajt6cj8753|at|}

North MAFIA's with 1@h.  The idea is to find a 4-4 fit wherever spades or hearts.  
South now bids the 2@d Drury  -    3-card support,    5-7 HCP.  
North has 20 HCP,  so adds it up  25-27 total.  
There is enough for game, but it's time to be sneaky and get South to declare.   

North does not want to declare with the singleton diamond, so North can bid 2@s to wait and force.  
South has minor stoppers so tries 2NT.. just what North wanted to hear. |

nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psAQ9h964dJ97ct953|at|}


2@D   "drury"   (5-7 hcp, 3-card support)  

This time, same start.  North again angles South towards 3NT.  
South has stuff in the @s and @d so tries 3NT.  

You might wonder why South is not raising clubs.  
There is a club fit after all, but South knows that 11 trick contracts can be difficult.  
3NT is a lot easier, just 9 tricks and South has nothing really to ruff – 4333.|

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psQ5hQ6dJ9642c9864|at|}

Here's another hand for MAFIA.  
1@s is forcing one round.  
South has a double-negative.  (1NT  =  0-5) 
So North runs to 2@d and South will take it.

North has a good hand here.  Let's put MAFIA to the test.  
South has the 2@d Drury.  
North is happy to hear South is 5-7,  but 4@s is not the game, 5@d is!  
The problem with the 4-3 @s fit is that the long trump hand (North) may be ruffing early, shortening the spades.  
Diamonds is safer.  
South is surprised to find herself declarer, but it's pretty easy.

Here South has another 2@d  Drury.

South again has a 4333 so tries 3NT.

First the Major is bid     (MAFIA)
And south shows a double negative with 1NT  (0-5)
Now North ^*ujumps in the minor^*n
This promises just 4 of the Major, and 5+ of the minor.
South sees clubs are the best fit, so bids 5@c   (Or even 4@c )

Very difficult in standard methods.
If North opens 2@c in standard, you might get there, but South will never take the push
Precision makes it easier.|

If North has a ^*uGF hand with one long minor^*n...
North can just bid the minor at the 3-level
This ^*bdenies^*n a 4-card major

We saw earlier that ^*bwith a 4-card major you bid the major first^*n
So South need not worry about spades and just bids 3NT

Handout:  1@d Response to 1@c - 0-7 HCP, any distribution

Generally when you open a strong club, it’s one of the delights of bridge 
– you announce to the world you probably have the strongest hand at the table – 
kind of like opening 2@c in standard, but you get to do it more often.  
But the 1@d is a splash of water in the face 
- responder might have a Yarborough and is advertising such.
Opener must take a chill pill and get back to business.  
Time to find the 8 card major suit fit, and get to the proper level.

The following quizzes you should attempt after reviewing the main text, Standard Modern Precision 
– Getting From Here to There.  
Answers will appear at the end.  

As always, hands are displayed in spades-hearts-diamonds-clubs order.|

Answers to Quizzes

Quiz 1: Opener’s rebids after 1@c-1@d

a. 1NT – This is a 17-19 HCP NT on the ladder, which rebids 1NT.
b. 1@h - This is forcing, so we will show the length of the hearts later by rebidding 2@h if possible.  If you were worried about that stiff @cQ, the length of the hearts should compensate.
c. 1@h - Majors come first always in this sequence.  The plan is to seek a 4-4 heart fit and retreat to clubs if not.  Partner’s next bid will tell us how to proceed.   Partner cannot Pass 1@h.
d. 1NT – Generally 5332 hands are NT hands – so this is a 17-19 NT and rebids 1NT.
e. 2@d -  In contrast to hand (c) this hand has no major suit so is free to bid the minor suit immediately.
f. 2NT –  On the NT ladder, this hand is too strong to open 2NT, so opens 1@c and jumps to 2NT.  Partner can now use Puppet Stayman or transfers or whatever you normally use over a 2NT opening.
g. 2@s - if you are basically at game you should announce such by jumping in the major.  If you like you can use the cheaper minor as a 2nd negative over these jumps, just as if you opened a standard 2@c and rebid a suit.
h. 1@h - Again, majors first.  If partner has 4 hearts or 4 spades we will find a major suit fit.  If partner has neither major we could play 1NT or 2@d.  
i. 3NT – This is the game forcing NT hand.  I recommend you might think about playing Kokish so that 1@c-1@d-2@h is 2-way:  hearts or this hand.  Partner would be forced to relay 2@s and now you can rebid 2NT with this hand (so you have transfers and Stayman available) and anything else with the heart hand.  But for now, you just jump to 3NT.  Why not open 3NT?  Because you want to investigate slam if partner has 8+ HCP and does not bid 1@d.  If you open 3NT with a strong hand you lose that ability.|

nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

Quiz 2: Responder’s rebids after 1@c-1@d-1M

a. 1@s - up the line, 0-7 HCP
b. 1NT – the double-negative, denies spades or good heart fit
c. 2@s - a jump-shift rebid shows a top of the range hand with a good 6 crd suit
d. 2@h - 4 card support double-negative
e. 2NT – a mini-splinter raise of hearts, partner can relay to find out where the singleton is
f. 3@h - 4 card support, top of range
g. 2@c - a good hand, but denies 4 spades or a fit, artificial
h. 2@d - the “support double” – good hand but just 3 hearts
i. 4@d - a void mega-splinter;  your hand has increased in value from the 1@h rebid

Quiz 3:  Responder’s rebids after 1@c-1@d-1NT

a. 2@h - transfer to spades;  just as if partner opened 1NT
b. 2NT – invite to 2NT (or if you use 4 suit transfers, bid 2@c followed by 2NT)
c. 2@c - seeking a 4-4 heart fit;  we will continue to  game since partner’s minimum of 17 and our 7 gives 24
d. 2@s - signoff in a minor (or, playing 4 suit transfers, 2N);  we aim to get out in 3@d

Quiz 4:  Opener’s rebids after 1@c-1@d-1@s-2@c

a. 2@s - 6 or more cards, minimum hand;  we may have enough for game, but if partner has a singleton or void in spades, the hand is not so good – if partner has a doubleton, she will probably try 3@s now
b. 2@d - we want to get out in the best partial, so we wait with 2@d;  if partner has 4 hearts she will bid 2@h and we can Pass;  if partner has a doubleton spade she will rebid 2@s and we will correct to 3@c (which partner should have length in)
c. 2@d - again, we have a flexible hand;  if partner rebids 2@s, this time we will Pass
d. 3@d - we show 5+ diamonds and a game forcing hand
e. 2@h - if partner has 4 hearts partner may raise us, possibly to game;  you may choose to play that this promises 5 hearts (and wait with 2@d with just 4 hearts);  also, you may choose to play that 1@c-1@d-1@s-2@h promises 6, and 1@c-1@d-1@s-2@c may have 5 hearts (rebid 2@h)
f. 3@s - game forcing, 6+ spades;  if partner rebids 3NT we will play it there|

Quiz 5:  Opener’s rebids after 1@c-1@d-1@h-2@d

a. 2@s - we know there is no spade or heart fit, but we want to get to 3NT from the right side;  if partner rebids 3@c we know there is a diamond problem and may proceed to 5@c;  if partner rebids 3@d we will rebid 3NT;  if partner goes back to 3@h we will complete our shape with 4@c and partner can make the final decision
b. 4@h - we know where we want to end up, so we bid it
c. 3@s - a jump-shift after a major fit is a splinter;  we might have slam
d. 3@c - we are going to wager game, we just want to right-side 3NT, or get to 5@c;  4@h might be ok but we are ruffing with the long trump hand which would be embarrassing if trumps were 4-2 or 5-1
e. 2NT – we want to see what partner has;  if partner rebids 3NT we are happy to play it there;  if partner rebids a minor we will investigate slam lightly;  we can always go back to 4@h at any time

Quiz 6:  Responder’s rebids after 1@c-1@d-2@s

a. 3@s - announce the fit and let partner take it from there
b. 2NT – this hand could be played in several different strains – 2NT is the best waiting bid
c. 2@h - we have a long suit, though the hand is not the best
d. 4@s - fast arrival in a game forcing situation;  however if you play 3@c 2nd negative, this would be the time
e. 4@d - splinter for spades, not a minimum|

^b@2djneill: In this lesson we will go over the  1@c - 1@h sequences
Last time we looked at  1@c - 1@d (0-7 HCP)
That turned out to be a lesson in how to get to the right contract but  not TOO high

This time we will release the brakes, we are going to game!
1@c - 1@h shows   ^*b8-11 HCP, any distribution^*n

If you add 8 to opener's 16, that's 24
Pretty much game values
So  1@c - 1@h is game forcing
But we still don't know anything about any of the hands' shapes!!
We will see how to find the right fit
The main concept in bidding in  1@c - 1@h is that we are going to game!
We can't stop
So we have lots of room to figure everything out
Nobody has to jump around

It's important that both sides bid their  ^*bPRIMARY SUIT^*n first
What is a PRIMARY SUIT?
The PRIMARY SUIT is your longest 5+ card suit
If you have 5 spades, 4 hearts, 3 diamonds, and 1 club, your PRIMARY SUIT is spades
So the first suit you would introduce after  1@c - 1@h  is spades.

Lets look at some example hands.      To skip to a next hand use the  ^$41 as usual|

North's longest 5+ card suit is spades
So that is the primary suit.

nt||lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^2s|mb|2Sp|at|So South should raise the spades|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


nt||sk|n|at|OK so North knows there is a 9-card spade fit now
The game we will play will be 4@s, clearly
But could there be more?
If South has 11 HCP, and North has 16, that's 27 with a 9-card fit and a singleton
North could imagine South with the  @dAKQxx and  @sQxx|
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


nt||lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^3c|mb|3Cp|at|So I think North might use a little room here to cue-bid
A cue-bid is an Ace, King, singleton, or void

3343 is horrible and just 9 HCP, not 11

It took a while, but we got to game.

nt||at|Major_Blue:  South raised with @SQxx.  What would she do with @Sxxx ?
djneill: Good question Major
If South had xxx, that's still 8 card fit, so South would raise.
Rickc54:  What would  3@s over the  3@h cuebid indicate?
djneill: 3@s over 3@h would indicate a  @sA or  @sK|
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


nt||at|The key to this cue-bidding auction is that North ALLOWED for South to have a good 11 HCP, 
and South ALLOWED for North to have a great hand (22+), 
but both sides quickly gave up to show each did not have a good hand.
Again, North bid her PRIMARY SUIT - longest 5+ card suit - first
We will see later how sometimes you don't find a fit, and end up in 3NT|
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


nt||at|yleexotee:  Dan, can you give an example of what bid from south could encourage her further?
djneill: If South had a great hand, like  @dAKQxx, South could cue-bid @d AGAIN, showing two controls
South is actually not too far from a  1@c - 1@h - 1@s - 4@s jump - FAST ARRIVAL
Remember, FAST ARRIVAL in a game forcing auction, (jumping to 4 of a major) shows the WORST EVER HAND
Does South have the worst ever 8-11 raise with 3+ spades?|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


nt||at|It's pretty close :-)      4333 is an abominable shape    @cJ is not proven to be worth anything
Karen10: Any way to show the difference between a 3 or 4 card support?
djneill: No, but if you have a 4-card support, remember, that's the MAGIC BERGEN SPARKLY NINE CARD FIT
The MBSNCF is worth a lot
So in the subsequent auction, you would encourage partner.
Remember, if you raise to  2@s, it could be 3 or 4 -  So make sure you help partner to bid more if possible
The MBSNCF would never bid fast arrival immediately|

mb|p|sk|n|mb|1Np|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


sk|s|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^2c|mb|2Cp|at|Ok at this point, we use normal Stayman and transfers
South assumes North has 17-19
If North has 24+, North will take over later and do something like bid a slam
But 17-19 is the most common
|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


nt||sk|n|mb|2Dp|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


sk|s|mb|3Nppp|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


sk||at|South has no interest in a minor or anything else, other than 3NT
So South can just leap to 3NT
North has 17-19, no reason to do anything but Pass
In SAYC, North would open 1NT and South would bid just the same as here - Stayman followed by 3NT
This is a very analogous sequence to SAYC, should be easy to remember.|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


nt||at|1@c - 1@d - 1NT  also uses Stayman and transfers if you recall
So  1@c - 1@d - 1NT and    1@c - 1@h - 1NT   proceed all the same way
The only difference is that responder the first time is 0-7 and the second sequence 8-11
Also, if anyone plays step responses to 2@c in SAYC,  where 2@c-2@d  is 0-3,  2@c-2@h  is 4-6, etc, 
this is very similar to this point.
In this example nobody bid a PRIMARY SUIT because North did not have one! A PRIMARY SUIT must be 5+ or more cards.
But, North would rebid 1NT also with  5 of a minor and 5332 shape|
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


nt||at|Isabelle10:  So, if its 5 of minor and balanced do you still bid primary or NT?
djneill: If the hand would open 1NT, it is very often correct to rebid NT too
In general the balanced hand, not the unbalanced hand, should be declaring too.   Why?
Because the unbalanced hand has a singleton
If you play 3NT, and they lead the singleton, you want the hand guarding that suit to be declaring 
to protect it from the lead
So very often,  1NT is a great rebid if you are balanced|
pg| ***** 94 ***** |


nt||at|Karen10: Would you rebid NT with the range and a 5- card major?   Or always the major?
djneill:  With 5 of a major, and (332) shape, you can optionally bid either 1NT or the major.
It is not as important here,  because the main reason to OPEN 1NT with 5332 (in sayc or 2/1)
is because the system cannot find out that hand otherwise.
But in  1@c - 1@h    we are already going to game!    There is no big reason to hide your major|

Should North bid  3@h or  4@h, I wonder,  or maybe  4@d ?|
pg| ***** 102 ***** |


at|
4@d really should have 4+ trumps      (Splinter)
So the question is whether North's hand "qualifies" as the WORST EVER HAND
Well, 3 Aces and a singleton is not bad
but it does just have 3 trumps and 16 HCP|
pg| ***** 103 ***** |


nt||at|I think it's close but we'll go with 3@h
So we know what trumps is now!
There is an 8+ card heart fit
|
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


nt||sk||mb|4hppp|at|So  4@h is the game we will play, unless there is something more
South has 9 HCP, and just 5 trumps
Also, the @cQ is unproven, and the @dJ is nothing amazing.
But the @sK could be quite valuable to North
So the question is whether to CUE-BID, or just sign off in  4@h ?
Again very close|
pg| ***** 105 ***** |


nt||at|I think 4@h is not a bad call here
OK, so in SAYC this hand might be a problem....
North would open 1@s      South would respond 1NT
North would rebid 2@c      and South is stuck in the middle ground
Bid  2@h on a flimsy 5-card suit?
Most likely South would rebid 2@s, and you have lost the heart suit.
So Precision scores well in the 16+ HCP range|
pg| ***** 106 ***** |


nt||at|As long as the opps don't bid :-) 
(we will discuss that next week)
So the first hand, OPENER bid the primary suit and there was a fast fit
This time, RESPONDER bid her primary suit and there was a fit there.

So North can reasonably Pass this|
pg| ***** 112 ***** |


nt||sk||at|4@h is pretty difficult but 3NT has chances
In general, 5332 opposite 4333 in an 8-card fit plays better in 3NT, or at least as well, as 4 of the major
Of course if a suit is not stopped, that could hurt
But North is pretty solid in the side suits

She has 3 baby diamonds, but a flat hand
South could choose  2NT here, or  3@d
The way to tell is where the honors are - here South has honors in 2 side suits
Also, 4333 is a NT shape, not a @d shape
So I would try 2NT with South's hand.
|
pg| ***** 117 ***** |


nt||sk|n|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^3s|mb|3Sp|at|OK, we have discussed the PRIMARY suits
Time for the SECONDARY suit.
The secondary suit is the next-longest 4+ card suit
Sometimes you will have two 5+ card suits - in that case, the higher suit is the primary and the lower is the secondary
So in this way,  you can find a 4-4 major fit, even if the primary suits struck out.
|
pg| ***** 119 ***** |


nt||sk|s|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^3n|mb|3Nppp|sk||at|Now South has a judgement call -  4@d or  3NT
My view is that 3NT is where you want to be if there is any doubt between 3NT and 5 of a minor
So that would explain why North is also going to Pass 3NT
You may have heard this mentioned somewhere as "Hamman's Rule"
|
pg| ***** 121 ***** |


nt||at|yleexotee:  Dan, because 3@s was bid second it guarantees 4 spades. 
But if the hand was 6-5 diamonds-spades... "could" it be 5 spades?
djneill: Good question, if North had 6@d's and 5@s's,    would not North still bid the same way?
Well, in that case, North can rebid  4@s over 3NT.|
pg| ***** 122 ***** |


nt||at|wyoming33: With possible 24 HCP is 5 of minor likely to make? Of course going to have distribution to figure in
djneill:  Yes  5@d might make here
The fewer HCP you have,  the harder it is to make an 11 trick contract
So with 24 I would be much more apt to try 3NT than 5@d
But with 29 HCP  5@d becomes not so hard
But either way, 3NT should have a shot|

However, you must know, that a splinter can hurt a little too

So North's @sK goes down in value
Still, North has an ok hand, 18 HCP, not 16
3 Aces, and the trump Queen      5-4 shape    so North should cooperate I think

sk|n|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^3d|mb|3Dp|at|OK, so North's longest suit is @c, not @d
So North bids 2@c to start and diamonds is the secondary suit
At this point, North can take stock.
North's hand has 2 losers - the little @h, and a @d
The chance that South does NOT cover any of those losers,  with 8-11 HCP, is small
The challenge then is to find grand slam if it is right|

Also, South knows that the  @cJT and  @dT are very useful
The  @hK, who knows     the @sAce is probably useful
So South probably should just bid 5 of a minor, since there is nothing "extra" about the hand
If South had lots of goodies, like the  @dQ, South probably would have cue-bid a major
So South is not showing an amazing fitting hand

nt||sk|n|lb|*bPlease chose your bid.^^6c|mb|6Cppp|sk||at|North can't count 13 tricks for sure, so just bids 6@c
This grand depends on the @d hook
In SAYC, North would open 2@c,   South might wait with 2@d
North would rebid 3@c....it's difficult
North might bash to a slam but there is no intelligent way to bid the hands in SAYC or 2/1
Precision again works best|
pg| ***** 176 ***** |


nt||at|On other layouts, grand would easily be reached, 
since North is showing  6@s and 5@d's at the 3-level

South likes the club lead, and West thought he was being sneaky.

nt||at|djneill: OK that was the last hand of this session
 *throws eraser at sleepers in back*
For next Friday, Feb 21 4pm Eastern, we will go over the looming shadow over our 1@C opening:  interference.  
You should study pp 9-10 (interference over 1@C-1@D) and 19-22 (interference over 1@C) in your book.  
It is definitely worth a full lesson to go over.  
So many players play precision and fall to pieces when the opponents bid.  
Thankfully we will learn some tips and techniques to survive.  Precision can be quite imprecise!|

fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|

^b@2djneill: The topic of today's lesson is handling intererence over our 1@c opening
That is when the opponents overcall our 1@c, or double it, or even overcall over a 1@c - 1@d response

Just to review, 1@c-1@d  is 0-7 HCP

Now, it's not too hard to handle when we have made a positive response
e.g. 1@c - 1@h   (8-11) - and now they bid 2@c
It's still the same idea, we bid our PRIMARY SUITS first, and get to the right game
But we have the extra juicy chance of penalizing the opponents
Whenever we make a POSITIVE response, GAME GOING, doubles are penalty.

So today I'm going to talk about the difficult situation where we don't know if we have game or not.
Let's start with 1@c - (Pass) - 1@d|

So here, North pretends West opened 1@s|

If you recall the NT ladder
1@c opening then cheap NT is 17-19
So that is what 1NT shows

pg| ***** 213 ***** |


nt||mb|pp|sk|s|at|djneill:  We just proceed as over a 1NT opening
South has 3 HCP

sk||at|djneill:  but West was not done!
East is not that happy
and South can just Pass, surely the opponents are in the throes of a misfit
This probably makes tho
So after 1@c - (P) - 1@d - and 4th seat bids, we pretend they opened
The key again is:  If partner (South) could have zero HCP, we pretend they opened.|

Just because you open a strong 1@c does not mean the opponents do not have game
When I began Precision, I would double the opponents in game, because it made no sense, them bidding game over our strong bid
But if you think about it, 16 HCP out of 40 leaves 24 HCP
And these days, games need fewer and fewer HCP :-)|
pg| ***** 266 ***** |


nt||at|djneill:  So I would suggest, if the opponents bid game over your strong club, 
don't double them unless you really think they are going down based on your hand.
This hand for instance, West loses 1@d, 1@c, 1@s, without breaking a sweat
But also the strong club is good for another thing
It can scare the opponents into *not* bidding a game
Just like an opening 1NT makes it unlikely the opponents will bid a game.

Isabelle10:  How much do you need to jump bid, i.e. 3 diamonds?   (like previous hand)
djneill:  The jump "overcall" by opener over 1@s promises about 8.5 tricks

^b@2djneill:  OK these 10 example hands have been wild and wooly, 
precision makes auctions very fun sometimes.
But the key principles remain:
Bid your PRIMARY suits first
And, if South (1@d responder) could have 0 HCP, we pretend THEY OPENED and bid accordingly.

Isabelle10:  in general does the 1 club opener always try to bid again after interference
djneill:  North could Pass, often with 17-19 BAL and no stopper
Or, if West had bid 2@s, not 1@s, that might silence many North hands for a bit.
But North should strain to bid, the 1@c told nothing about the shape of the hand, it is time to show it.

I will mention that interference against a strong club is the best defense to a strong club
It is important not to sit on your hands when the opponents open 1@c
If you do not overcall, they will tend to find the best contract.

djneill:  Good question came up, isn't North's first Pass over 1@s always a TRAP pass, with long spades?
North could have something like   @s Jxx  @h AKx  @d KQJx  @c KJx
In that case, North would have no bid
So North would just Pass over 1@s
Perhaps North could double, but it's close
southuist:  Because I was wondering how south tells the difference, and how do you alert a trap pass?
Do you alert it?
djneill:  No Pass is alertable in bridge, it's always either "nothing to say" or "trap"
Ok I guess there may be a Pass sometimes but it is rare, that it is alertable.|

^b@2djneill: I would like to go into the hands where EAST overcalls over 1@c DIRECTLY
This is where it gets the most difficult for our intrepid precisioneers

After  1@c - (Pass) - 1@d,  we have at least established responder is weak.
But over IMMEDIATE interference, South is not even limited at all.
Let's see how it works.

The first thing South can do is Pass
Pass always could be a broke hand, weak.
But, it could also be a TRAP
Just like if we opened 1@c in SAYC   and East bid 1@h
If South has 6 hearts, South will Pass, and await a reopening double by North
So this TRAP theory is really just standard SAYC stuff.

How weak is weak?
Well, Pass is about 0-5 HCP
That gives North a warning that things may not be as shiny as hoped.|

fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|

^b@2djneill: This is the next lesson in the Standard Modern Precision series
We have up until now concentrated on the 1@c opening, 16+ and strong, artificial.
Indeed that is the hallmark opening of precsion, separating it from SAYC

Now we turn to 1@d - "could be short"
Or as rodwell says, "a billion served"
The reason he says that is that it's 1@d that is the most likely opening in precision.
Technically it's 11-15 with 2+ @d's, but let's break that down into hand types

- First, there is the "weak NT" - 11-13 balanced
- Next there is the real hand with long diamonds
- and finally there are the hands with both minors (or 3-suiters)

The key thing to remember when partner opens 1@d is:
^*bASSUME PARTNER IS 11-13 BALANCED^*n    until further notice
Because that is exactly what she is most likely to have.
So what this means is:     ^*bWe invite not with 10 or 11, but 12^*n and we force to game with 13 

In SAYC you would force to game with 12 most often, but Precision opens 1 HCP lighter
So you need 1 HCP more!
However, we will see that opener may have 14-15 if unbalanced, and that she will reveal in time.
But if opener is balanced, she is 11-13
Let's take a look|

Much like if North opened a short club, it is dangerous to assume partner has more than 2 or 3 of the cards.
1NT should play fine if both hands are balanced.
Another thing about the 1@d is that neither opponents nor responder know for sure what minor(s) opener really has
This can produce some good results and some bad results, for both sides - it's just part of the system.
Much of 1@d bidding is totally natural|

sk||at|djneill: Opener can raise the major response with 4 cards
This shows 11-13 BALANCED, or rarely a very bad hand unbalanced.
But always 4 cards, never 3
In Standard Modern Precision, it is the choice the designers made, but it's a good agreement for anyone to have.
That way you know pretty sure how to follow the LAW quickly.|
pg| ***** 400 ***** |


nt||at|djneill:  Here South has 9 HCP and a 9 trump fit
How to know how high to go?
The key is:   ^*bASSUME OPENER HAS 11-13 BALANCED^*n  until further notice
So opposite 11-13 balanced, South can count only 20-22 HCP total
Not enough for game, especially if balanced, so South can Pass|

13 HCP, but NOT balanced, 6 nice diamonds, 4 nice trumps and a singleton

Isabelle10:  Could the diamond cue show a void?
djneill:  That's a good question because if Souh could be void (or singleton), the @d don't appear to set up that quickly
When I or my partners cue-bid in partner's suit, we do not have a singleton or void, it's always an honor.
The reason is just what you said, a void is not good but bad, in partner's suit, usually
So in the case we are looking at, 4@d shows an Ace (or King).|

North has 4 diamonds and 5 clubs
The plan is to describe a hand with lots of minor cards by opening 1@d and rebidding 2@c
North has 15 HCP though, and 1@d is 11-15, so might not North want to leap to 3@c instead?
In Precision, you only leap with very nice shape

We will discuss 2 of a minor response to 1@d next time.
But here, South is balanced so will bid some number of NT
We talked about assuming opener is 11-13 BALANCED until further notice....
So what should South bid opposite 11-13 balanced?
It's 11, but a good 11, maybe an aggressive 2NT would be good

It will be an interesting contract - South needs lots of finesses.
This hand may even be a Passout in SAYC!      11-11-11-7 around the table

sk||at|djneill:  Last time, South bid 2NT
Remember, South cannot be sure North has more than 2 diamonds (or 2 clubs), so South is forced to bid 1NT
And of course North cannot know about the 4 diamonds South has either.
South could be 2335 or 3334 e.g.     even 3325
So rebidding 2@d would be quite risky, and 1NT is probably the right final contract|
pg| ***** 544 ***** |


nt||at|djneill:  This contract is doomed, everything is wrong.
But it does make a number of spades for E-W so that's not too bad.
Both not vulnerable, it's even a good matchpoint score
Look if North Passes to start, as in SAYC, East opens 1@c, and E-W may end up in 1NT or 2@s
Should make  +110 or  +120 maybe for E-W|
pg| ***** 545 ***** |


nt||at|djneill:  But in 1NT N-S, down 1 or 2 is just  -50 or  -100
Very good for N-S here.

5@s's and 4/5 @h's    and a weak hand|
pg| ***** 554 ***** |


nt||at|The reason for this bid is two-fold:
First, it describes the hand precisely
Second, it preempts the opponents
But there is a third reason:
If opener is, say, 1453 and responder 5422,    it might start 1@d - 1@s - 2@c
Both sides are too weak to find the heart fit.

fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|

^b@2djneill: We are still going over the 1@d opening ("could be short")
Last time we just assuaged fears that most 1@d auctions may be very unnatural - in fact, most are very natural.
Just bid your majors up the line to find a fit.

You can use new minor forcing, support doubles, the whole thing.

Today we will go into the ^*u2 of a minor response to 1@d^*n

Both 2@c and 2@d responses show about the same thing:  ^*bGF unless suit rebid^*n

So if you have a long minor and an ^*uinvite^*n hand, you can respond 2 of the minor, 
and rebid the minor later at the 3-level non forcing

We will go through all this but the main thing to remember when responding to 1@d is to 
ASSUME OPENER IS 11-13 BALANCED,       because that is most often what opener is.

So here is an example hand                    click   ^$40|

sk||at|djneill: Opposite 11-13 balanced, responder just wants to be in 3NT.
True, North could be unbalanced with diamonds, but South is so flat, it is the obvious final contract.
Also, note that South wants to declare this one.
South has tenaces (AQ, KJ, QT, e.g.) to guard
South wants the lead coming to her hand from West!|
pg| ***** 600 ***** |


nt||at|djneill:  So South *could* bid 2@c to start
But that is a slow route, giving away information.
Part of the great thing about precision is that you know opener's shape and strength relatively early so
you don't have to dally around, you can just bid the final contract.
In SAYC, maybe North is 19-20 HCP, who knows....
But in precision, there is no slam, North is 11-15, but even more likely:  11-13 balanced
We will spend some time here discussing when opener is 11-13 balanced|

Therefore, 3NT is the best final contract

South is weak in the majors, should she remove 3NT?|

Things are not so pleasant for North unfortunately, maybe it makes actually...

But as usual, if 3NT does not make, 5 of a minor is not so great either.
So 3NT is the general final contract.

So North can just sign off in 3NT, declining the slam try.

Now 18 with a good 5-card suit in SAYC would be very slammish indeed...
That is what South has...
But remember that Precision is a light opening system - all 11's are opened|
pg| ***** 684 ***** |


nt||at|And indeed North's 2@h showed 11-13
So in context, 18 is nowhere close to forcing to slam  (even 18 and 13 is just 31 HCP)
South was hoping North had a good hand for clubs and a ruffing value, so maybe 6@c could make
Even 3NT might go down on a spade lead if clubs don't break.

sk||at|djneill:  South has 11, but remember, Precision opens light, 
so 11 is not enough to force to game on, sometimes not even enough to invite on.
So South can Pass.

The problem with retreating into clubs is that when opener bids 1@d then 2@c, it shows BOTH minors
North would be embarassed if South corrected 2@c back to 2@d with 4 diamonds :-)
Playing in a 4-2 fit is not fun.
So North just pauses and plays it here.

In SAYC, you have to be pretty darn weak, in case opener is 18+  ....
But in Precision, opener is 11-15, in fact, usually 11-13 balanced.
So "weak" is more like 6 to 10
even less if NV

^b@2djneill:  today is just a runthrough of hands that occurred and how precision worked - cherry picked hands :-)

Karen10: Dan with which partners do you always play precision on bbo so we can kib?
djneill:  shaji, foobar, paulatl
djneill:  and pauli on another website I will not name :-)
Karen10: OK :)

cdt: Is this the only form of precision you play?
djneill:  There are other ways brewed up by various mad scientists, I do play a few other ways, but as you will see today, it's the general idea of limited openings that works so well in any precision system
The thing that ties all precision systems together is:  limited openings, strong club
Standard modern precision is the one that is going around all the top players now and will be used by more of "us"

West could have 14-16 HCP, with a bad suit, e.g.
But as you can see on this real deal, North was lying in wait
If East pushes higher, the contracts are doomed|

so any game is marginal to horrible
Therefore, East can just Pass

But remember, leaping away from a short @d is more normal than the safety of a 5-2 @s fit
So here, South can Pass reasonably
This hand demonstrates you can use judgement at precision
1@s is not great, but if North bids 1@c precision, it may get too high easily
Watch what might happen

fp||cp|2|ht|e|at|
^b@2
djneill:  Today we will finish our look at Standard Modern Precision with the 2@c and 2@d openings
These openings are similar to some openings you may have already seen before

The 2@c opening is like a "great" weak two  in clubs
The 2@d opening is like Mini-Roman, a 3-suited hand

The real reason to have these openings is because 1@c and 1@d are used for other things 
so we need a way to show long clubs (2@c) or short @d (2@d)


The first hand I just want to show you makes it clear that 2@c is just a big cousin to the weak two
A weak two is 6-10 HCP
This is the next step up: 11-15

cdt: What is the max to open 2@C?
djneill:  2@c shows 11-15 HCP with 6 or more @c's
The range is similar to that of the 1@d, 1@h, 1@s, 2@d openings

nt||sk|s|mb|p2N|an|transfer to 3@c|at|djneill:  Here, South knows that North has long clubs, so there are at least 9 cards in the fit.
The LAW says you can bid to the 3-level with 9 trumps.
So South  just transfers to 3@c - a special bid.

What would a 3@c direct raise by South  mean?  We will see later.

sk||at|djneill:  So the 2@c bid functions in multiple ways:  
It preempts the opponents, gets to a good club fit, and prepares room to find a 4-4 major fit.

It is a very effective way to show a club suit
In SAYC or 2/1, you have to start with a convenient club, and hope to show clubs later.

It's not forcing, but make sure you know, partner has zero or 1 diamond
Here, South has a pretty good idea what North has
The @dAce will cover a singleton nicely, and the 9-card fit in spades should make game promising
Finally, South knows the opponents might have a game in diamonds!
So it's important to strike fast

But there is a 7-1 diamond fit, and they probably will run
South has 16 HCP, and North 13-15 about     so that's 29-31 HCP, pretty close to slam
It might depend on exactly what North has
Without any good information, it's not good to risk a slam.
