^b{^*Gamps,^*B Inverted Minors with Cornelia Yoder   aka   "Chick"  ^*N }|


fp||cp|2|cs|1|ht|e|at|^b@2The ^*bInverted Minor Convention^*n is used over a one of a minor opening bid by partner.
There are two parts in this raise of the minor – one is a weak raise, the other constructive.   
The convention is called Inverted Minors as we reverse the meaning of the single raise and the jump raise.   
A Passed hand can still use the convention, as it can still have the constructive values.

^*bCriteria^*n - You should NOT have a 4-card Major when raising the minor.
Either 2 or 3 of the opened minor 100% denies a Major.
Using the Inverted Minor bid means you are giving up on finding a Major fit.
You must have 5+ cards in opener’s (partner's) minor suit.

^*bIn competition^*n – The ^*upreemptive jump raise^*n bid (1@d - (overcall or X) - 3@d ) is still "on",
however, the single (constructive) raise is "off" in competition.

The Inverted Minor bid needs to be ^*balerted^*n – both the 2-level club/diamond and 3-level club/diamond raises.

Discuss this fully with a regular partner before you start to use Inverted Minors and practice the full convention.

Note: The BBO GIB ROBOTS DO NOT PLAY INVERTED MINORS FULLY – They only play the 2 OR 3 level bids, but apparently don't know the rest of the convention.

Movie Maker (MM): Hand types, bidding and follow-up bids will all be addressed with example hands.
The first section is "Weak raises".

It requires 5 cards in partner’s opening minor and fewer than 10 pts.
It DENIES a 4-card or longer Major.
The purpose of this is preemptive, making it harder for East to come into the auction now.
A raise to the 3-level (the Inverted Minor preemptive jump raise) is usually passed by opener.

Question:   In diamonds, can you bid an Inverted Minor with a 4-card diamond suit?
Answer:   It's better not to.
An 8-card fit at the 3-level is pushing it too much (remember the Law of Total Tricks).   
To make a preemptive raise, responder should have a 5-card minor suit.

mn|The constructive raise|cp|2|at|^b@2

The Constructive raise:    1@c - 2@c    or     1@d - 2@d

Both 2@c and 2@d are FORCING bids (but not necessarily game forcing).

The Constructive raise (10+ HCP) DENIES a 4-card Major.

Question:  Should you count only High Card Points (HCP) or Dummy points as well, and why?
Answer:  When you make a 1@c - 2@c bid, you don’t really want to play in @cs.
You really want to play in NT – so points should be only HCP!
Count points as though you are going to play in NT.

Where the "weak" raise is still "on" in competition, the "constructive raise" is NOT.

With a good hand after interference you ^*bcue bid^*n the opponent's suit to show support and game interest.


What happens next after a  1@c - 2@c    or     1@d - 2@d   raise?|

A STOPPER bidding sequence starts.  Both partners show their stoppers for NT.

Stoppers are: A  KQ  Kx (a poor stopper and better to consider it half a stopper)  Kxx  QJx  JTxx.
Qxx or QT are NOT full stoppers.
A VOID is never a stopper!

You do not have to alert stopper-showing bids.

(In a later section "half stoppers" will be discussed, also part of the IM convention)

North could bid just bid 3NT directly, but he would be gambling that his partner has a @d stopper.
With IM, he has a way to find out if his partner has @d's stopped.
The purpose of bidding 2@c (IM) is to determine if the partnership can play in NT safely.

What should North do?|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


at|
Does North know if South has @c's stopped?
No, because South has not yet had an opportunity to show or deny a @c stopper.
But since North has @c's and @s's stopped he can safely bid NT himself, in this case with 13 HCP, North bids 3NT.

The general rule for bidding 3NT is 13-15 HCP, and with 16 HCP make a slam try.

Is Kx a stopper? It's a poor stopper and certainly at risk if you end up as the dummy.
However, if you declare, it's protected (at least from the opening lead), 
so South should consider that she has all suits stopped and declare the NT.
North has only 11 points and passes.|

mn|The constructive raise   Key Points|cp|2|at|^b@2

KEY POINTS:

The OBJECTIVE with Inverted Minors (IM) is to play in NT if possible.
Having a strong minor suit fit (8-9+ cards in the suit) and stoppers in all the other suits suggests a NT contract.

When you use IM, you should NOT have a 4-card Major and you DO have a 5-card fit for opener’s minor suit.

Using the Inverted Minors convention is a request to start showing stoppers for NT.

The suit stopper sequence of bids ensures you have all suits stopped before you choose a NT contract.
Discovering a suit is not stopped means you return to the opening minor suit and play in it (@c's or @d's).

During the stopper sequence of bids, the first person who knows that a suit has no stopper held by either partner 
bids the lowest level in the agreed minor suit.

The first person who knows all suits are stopped bids NT at the appropriate level based on HCP.
If necessary, the other person can continue to game with enough HCP.


After an overcall:

If the opponents overcall, the single raise of Inverted Minors is off, but the preemptive jump raise is still used.

With a good hand, the stopper bidding sequence is not necessary after an overcall, 
since the opponents have announced the dangerous suit.
If you have stoppers in the overcalled suit, you can still consider NT.
If you don't, bid the minor suit again.


MM:  The next section will look at ^*bPartial Stoppers^*n as part of the IM convention.|

mn|Partial stoppers|cp|2|at|^b@2


PARTIAL STOPPERS:

How do you find out if you and partner each have a ‘partial stopper’ that together stops a suit, 
in order to arrive at a NT contract based on the joint partial stopper?

For example, if one partner has J10x and the other partner has Qx, that suit is stopped, 
but neither partner has a full stopper.

So there is a way to ask partner for a partial stopper in a suit where you have a partial stopper.

Two Rules:   

1.  If partner bids a suit in which he has already denied having a stopper, this shows a half stopper 
and asks partner to bid NT with a half stopper as well.

2.  If a player continues showing stoppers in other suits after BOTH have denied a stopper in one suit,
it shows a half stopper in the denied suit.

If both partners each have a half stopper, that makes a full stopper in that suit, and NT can be bid.

Half stoppers:   J10x, Kx, Qx, Jxxx, K (singleton)
A lot of length in suit can also be considered half a stopper (10xxxxx).
