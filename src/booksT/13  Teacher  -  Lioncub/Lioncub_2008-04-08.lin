^d @H@2Lioncub’s bidding session is held every Friday in the BIL at noon NY time. 3 Hands @e@3are bid with 4 volunteers and then change. Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play…….or both. Feel free to ask any questions that are bridge related.

^d @H@2What  :|CP||AT| For my later review I like to have a BBO movie representing lioncub's teaching session as close @e@3to the live event as possible. I am delighted that you can also enjoy it.|cp|8|at| 

How  :|CP||AT| In this presentation I have combined the hands from lioncub's Friday Teaching Sessions with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed and edited from the chat. He has approved the bridge information in this movie. You will see the four hands and the auction by the participants and after Allan has asked for a "Lead and Claim." The claim is meaningless and is made so his critique can begin. |cp|8|at| 

Goal :|CP||AT| The emphasis is to present lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  Incorrect grammar and spelling are tolerated. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. All the links in this file are clickable - they turn color when you move your cursor over them.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site. |FP|2|AT|

The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at|^*B HELP^*N |cp||FP|2|at|box at the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section. |FP||CP|8|AT|
 

Please help me improve these movies by sending suggestions to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.|CP||FP||AT|

                                               
                                              Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

lioncub: 1@C-? 
1@H is the correct bid...............always show the 5-carder in preference to double. Super bid by South, preemptive. Well done. Followed by 2 passes, the bid by E now is.....DOUBLE. THIS SHOWS THE SPADE SUIT .........but double would enable partner to bid 3@H if he did not have 4 spades. This is why bidding the 5-carder first is best. Questions? |

^B@2nome: Why the double is asking for spades and not @D? |
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: Could be diamonds ..........it is true.............but if partner bids 3@D, then bid 3@H then partner knows you have spades and hearts. |

lioncub: I agree, particularly with two 10s in the hand.
Jimmy  V: I considered it. I would have bid Heart with my regular partner.|

lioncub: 1@D opener always shows a 4-card suit, UNLESS the hand is 4/4/3/2...then open 1@D rather than 1@C with only 2. |

^B@2lioncub: Lead the J@H, top of sequence. South has a perfect 3@C opener, at any vulnerability, which N would do very well to pass. I repeat.........this is a perfect 3@C opener. Note all points in clubs. Super suit...........and nothing outside. However having passed...............and hearing partner open 1@D? Only bid you cannot make now is 2@C...........need 10 points to do that. And N must bid 2@H over 2@C. This is a reverse and forcing. And now of course NS are in a hopeless mess. Whereas a bid of 3@C would probably have bought the hand. |

^B@2lioncub: Lead OK, but need to switch to diamond at trick 2.
lioncub: 1@C-p-1@S-2@C-?  The bid here is..........DOUBLE. THIS IS THE SUPPORT DOUBLE SHOWING EXACTLY 3 SPADES. VERY IMPORTANT TO DO SO. When unsure if partner has 4 spades or more....your support double will tell him. But nevertheless NS got to the right contract. When unsure if partner's suit is 4-carder or longer ...if the opponents interfere.....as they did here.....then double or redouble shows EXACTLY 3 card support. |

^B@2lioncub: Hard to know what to lead on this bidding. Let's look closely at the bidding
lioncub: IF YOU HAVE A FLAT HAND UNDER 16 POINTS.......LEARN TO PASS QUICKLY......DO NOT THINK OF EVER BIDDING. AND NOW WE WILL SEE WHY. 
1@c-DBL-? Double of 1@C shows both majors or at worse one of the majors will only have 3 cards but will have 2 honours. The bid to make with the E hand is.............redouble. Showing 10+ points and looking for penalties. Assuming S passes, as will W. |
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT|
^B@2lioncub: Now what will N say after 1@C is doubled and redoubled? If he bids 1NT..............then E will double. Now what? South may attempt to rescue with 2@s which W will double. Note all this trouble NS are in.............just to protect a part-score. So I think the point has been made...........with N hand ..........only one bid to consider ........and that is pass. |

Avoid re bidding 5-card suit. 1NT is the only bid to consider  which will be passed out. |

^B@2lioncub: Correct lead. Please remember to do hand evaluations. Once suit is agreed, then add points for shape.  
1@S-2@C-2@S-3@C-? Sitting in South seat,,,,,,,,,,,look at how much hand is worth. 15HCP + plus 1 for doubleton and 3 for singleton. Therefore enough opposite min from partner. 4@S is correct.  W hand worth 2@C overcall..............note the 6-card suit. |

^B@2lioncub: The 10 is good lead. Bidding fine up to the double. Double is marginal. Alternative is 3@D. BUT the double shows the spade suit as well. Now to S.  3@H is showing something extra. Either extra Heart or something else. Here there is really nothing extra. The only one bid to make is..............PASS. Do you care if they find a spade fit? Pass by south would allow W to  bid 3@C  which E would not be overjoyed at. |
