^d @H@2Lioncub’s bidding session is held every Friday in the BIL at noon NY time. 3 Hands @e@3are bid with 4 volunteers and then change. Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play…….or both. Feel free to ask any questions that are bridge related.

^d @H@2What  :|CP||AT| For my later review I like to have a BBO movie representing lioncub's teaching session as close @e@3to the live event as possible. I am delighted that you can also enjoy it.|cp|8|at| 

How  :|CP||AT| In this presentation I have combined the hands from lioncub's Friday Teaching Sessions with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed and edited from the chat. He has approved the bridge information in this movie. You will see the four hands and the auction by the participants and after Allan has asked for a "Lead and Claim." The claim is meaningless and is made so his critique can begin. |cp|8|at| 

Goal :|CP||AT| The emphasis is to present lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  Incorrect grammar and spelling are tolerated. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. All the links in this file are clickable - they turn color when you move your cursor over them.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site. |FP|2|AT|

The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at|^*B HELP^*N |cp||FP|2|at|box at the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section. |FP||CP|8|AT|
 

Please help me improve these movies by sending suggestions to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.|CP||FP||AT|

                                               
                                              Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

^B@2Now, assume that you are sitting South. Review your hand and decide what bid you would have made if you actually were there. Write it down and click the forward arrow. You may find that your bid may be different from the player in time. Continue until the auction is over and there is a lead and claim. Then you will see all four hands. The claim is immaterial and is done so Allan can start his critique and recommendations. Then you can compare your bidding with his recommendations. It is as good as being there. Don't forget that unlike the actual player you would be playing all the boards. Good Luck.|

^B@2lioncub: correct lead is the ace clubs. Now look at N hand. 1@D opener is always a 4-card suit...................EXCEPT.....when hand is 4/4/3/2 as the N hand,,,,,,,,,,in which case please open 1@D.......don't like opening 1@C with only a doubleton.  1@S by East is marginal........not terrible. Now the S hand........bearing in mind that any direct raise is weak and preemptive..........why not bid 4@C?.  Force the opposition to have to guess at a high level. Rules for bidding in competition are.............all direct bids show under 8/9.  You show 9+ with a cue bid of enemy suit. |

^B@2lioncub: Correct lead. First  3 bids all correct. TIP FOR TODAY........WHEN PARTNER MAKES A TAKE OUT DOUBLE........ASSUME HE IS 4/4/4/1 WITH 12 POINTS. South has a singleton in the opps'  suit and should evaluates his hand with spades being the agreed trump suit.  7HCP plus 3 points for the singleton.......makes total of 10. So South should bid 3@S. And N now with that hand will bid game...........note ACES ARE GOLD AND KINGS ARE SILVER. Hand evaluation for N..........15+ 1 for doubleton =16............good value to bid game.  Let us move to the next board.|

^B@2lioncub: Lead the J@H not 4th highest............top of a broken sequence............read my article on leads at ^*Hwww.zyworld.com/lioncub/Leads.htm^*N. 
Now, 1@C-?  I tend to devalue unsupported jacks and queens in South hand. So in spite of 10 points..........I would recommend you underbid with 1NT.  2NT is stretching it. However, west should open using Rule 20.  My bidding:
p-1@H-2@C-2@H
3@C-3@H-p-p-p |

^B@2lioncub: Correct lead,  Bidding was reasonable.  Well done all of you. The Double by S was reasonable as he did have 4 spades to compensate for lack of points for take out double..............can't always have the perfect hand. |

^B@2lioncub: Lead is fine.  Now my hobby horse.  This you do not have to agree with me...........it is something I feel strongly about. 6/5 hands.............come alive !!!! I bid it as a powerhouse on the premise that only need partner to have partial support for one of the two suits.  My bidding would be:
1@D-1@S
2@H-2NT
3@H-4@H I will not spend a lot of time on this........you are welcome to disagree. |

^B@2lioncub: I would lead the 2@D partner's suit. There is no chance of getting that heart suit working. Now then ......after the 1@C opener Jimmy had hoped to bid both suits. But opps did not give him a chance. Even so.........with favourable vulnerability..........I would bid 4@S over 3NT. However.................how can he show both suits over the 1@C opener?  The answer is.............................2NT. This has to be unusual........over a major it would show both minors. Partner should be able to work out that it MUST show diamonds and a major. |

^B@2lioncub: Correct lead........showing a 3 or 4 card suit.
1@S-?  The  2@C bid is correct...........should have 10 points.........but here compensation in form of a good long suit. South has too weak a suit to bid 2@D. Then 2@S was 100% correct showing the 6-carder and underbidding as no fit with partner. Note that the double by south cannot be for penalty……as partner has not made a bid!! It should be for take out.  N should take it out to 3@D. |

^B@2lioncub: Good lead.   1@S-?  I can see W problem. We dont jump with just 3-card support........so sensibly makes a "waiting bid." The waiting bid was 100% correct..........except...don't do it in hearts.  The 2 level bid promises 5-card suit........does not matter if you lie about a minor.......but dont lie about the major. My bidding would be:
1@S-2@C
2@D-3@S
4@S-P-P-P  That is how to show 3-card spade support with 10-12 points. |

lioncub: Correct lead. 1@H-2@C-?  Super bid by Geof,  remembering that direct raises show maximum of 7 points in competition........show 10+ by cue bidding. Now, lets look at N hand. 11 points ( ignoring the Q@C) plus 3 points for singleton...........is 14 points. You have to recognise where the danger lies.  Partner has shown maximum of 7 points.  The danger is there to see.............the 3 losing clubs. So the sensible bid is to pass. |
