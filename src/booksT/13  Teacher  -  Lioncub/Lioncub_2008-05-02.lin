^d @H@2Lioncub’s bidding session is held every Friday in the BIL at noon NY time. 3 Hands @e@3are bid with 4 volunteers and then change. Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play…….or both. Feel free to ask any questions that are bridge related.

^d @H@2What  :|CP||AT| For my later review I like to have a BBO movie representing lioncub's teaching session as close @e@3to the live event as possible. I am delighted that you can also enjoy it.|cp|8|at| 

How  :|CP||AT| In this presentation I have combined the hands from lioncub's Friday Teaching Sessions with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed and edited from the chat. He has approved the bridge information in this movie. You will see the four hands and the auction by the participants and after Allan has asked for a "Lead and Claim." The claim is meaningless and is made so his critique can begin. |cp|8|at| 

Goal :|CP||AT| The emphasis is to present lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  Incorrect grammar and spelling are tolerated. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. All the links in this file are clickable - they turn color when you move your cursor over them.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site. |FP|2|AT|

The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at|^*B HELP^*N |cp||FP|2|at|box at the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section. |FP||CP|8|AT|
 

Please help me improve these movies by sending suggestions to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.|CP||FP||AT|

                                               
                                              Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

This is a hand that you should open 2NT even with a singleton. Partner will still pass

^B@2lioncub: mmmmmmmmmm where to start? Lead is correct. Next, I suggest not to open 1NT with a 5-card 
major. However...........after 1NT...............W correctly bids 2@H for partner to bid spades and Lou 
comes in with 3@C..............NOTE THIS IS A VULNERABLE AGAINST NON VULNERABLE BID, AND after E bids 3@S 
South should trust his partner and bid 5@C. On the premise that unsure who the hand belongs 
to...........make the opponents guess at a high level. As you can see 5@C makes. |

^B@2lioncub: Lead is correct. 1@H-x-1@S-?. The bid by North should be 2@s. A bid of 2@S........shows the hand 
exactly...........6-card suit and under 6 points. WHEN YOU GET FIRST BID WRONG...........HARD TO CATCH
UP. West has perfect hand-------shape and points--------for a take out double. |

^B@2lioncub: Lead is fine. The opening bid is a tad light even using rule of 20. But don't object to 
it............good quality suit. It is better than opening 2@S.  N can only pass. Now to East. Trumps are 
agreed as spades............so add points for distribution. Add one extra point for each of the 
doubletons........making 8+1+1=10. Therefore the bid is 3@S not 2@S. West would pass the invitation of 
3@S...............even more reason to pass that bid of 2@S. This light opening has had the desired 
effect......it has kept the opposition out of a 4@H contract. |

^B@2lioncub: Lead is correct. First 3 bids are fine.  Once again this question of support of overcalls arises. DIRECT RAISES ARE PREEMPTIVE AND SHOW UNDER 8ish points. You show support for partner with a minimum of 10 points by making a cue bid. Note ......the cue bid says nothing about the suit being 
cued...........just states the support and points. Therefore, the bid with the w hand is 3@H and then bid 
4@S even if partner signs off in 3. |

^B@2lioncub: Good lead. 1@C-? The suit is far too poor to overcall 1@D. And W is far too good to just bid 
2@C. Again the bid to make over 1@D is 2@D showing club support and 10+ points and denying 4-card major. 
A bid of  3@C would be preemptive after the overcall. Please all try to remember this showing support when the opponents 
interfere. Direct raises are preemptive cue bid shows support with 10+. |
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT|
^B@2dae: Do you use suit quality test to overcall  -length in suit + honors        bid to that level?
|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: Dot first...........overcall must ALWAYS WITHOUT FAIL..........SHOW A GOOD SUIT. On the other 
hand if we had the 1@C-p-? bidding, then the  bid with the W hand is 2NT. 1NT shows 6-9 and 3NT would show 
13-15. |

^B@2lioncub: No, always lead your partner's suit...............unless very good reason not to. TIP OF THE 
DAY..........MARK IT DOWN AND NOTE IT WELL..............HERE IT IS. WITH A 
FIT..........PUSH...........WITH NO FIT..............PULL BACK AND UNDERBID. So with 1@D-1@S-2@C-?. Pass. 
Note a double would be a support double showing exactly 3 spades and N would now of course bid 2@D which 
would be the final bid. |

^B@2lioncub: Lead is correct. All the first 6 bids were fine. It is now up to South to find another bid. 
Why not bid 2@S? You can show the spade suit without bidding it by a simple bid of 
......double. Double of 2@H that is. If partner bids 3@C, then you will bid 3@D. |

^B@2lioncub: Spade lead is correct BUT Lead the 10..., top of sequence. With a 5-card suit, this is slightly better than a lead of 4th highest. I want to give a gold medal to South.......for the best bid today. I am not 
joking. That PASS shows she is now a fully fledged bridge player. With flat hand up to 17 points only one 
bid ......to make is ..... pass. |
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


AT|
tjtoo: Okay - why shouldn't she double? |
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: Because, double of 1@C shows shortage in clubs and promises 4-card support  for both majors. I 
cannot stress this strongly enough. Winning bridge is to learn to pass with these flat hands sitting over 
an opener. |

sell out. My bidding is:
