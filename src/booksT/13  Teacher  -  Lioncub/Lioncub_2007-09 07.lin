^d @H@2Lioncub’s bidding session is held every Friday in the BIL at noon NY time. 3 Hands @e@3are bid with 4 volunteers and then change. Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play…….or both. Feel free to ask any questions that are bridge related.

^d @e@2In this presentation we have combined the movie of the hands from lioncub's Friday @e@3Teaching Session with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed version of chat log transcript.  

The emphasis is presenting to you lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  We did not focus on correctness of the grammar or the spelling.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. Clicking the first will move you forward and clicking the second will take you back. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. 

Further, all the links in this file are clickable - it turns blue when you move your cursor over it.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site.




Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

lioncub: Rules for opening preempts in 1st or 2nd seat are:
1. 5 - 9 points
2. 6-card suit headed by no worse than KJ9
3. no good defensive tricks
4. and also no 3 cards to an honor in other major.

lioncub: The reason for these rules is so that partner will know what to expect.   That is far more important than anything else.  Here the suit is not good enough......and not one but there are two outside aces. 

My bidding would be..............p-p-p-1NT.  Playing Capp.............North would be now able to show the spade suit. North would bid 2C ( if playing mod Capp.)
----------------------
lioncub: Lead is good.

lioncub: South is right not to open 2@S.  The hand breaks the rule about holding 3 to an honor in other major.  West has balanced 21 points.........just short of requirement to open 2@C.  The correct opener is 2NT. 

My bidding is 2NT-3NT

Kib: How would you respond to 2@C with 0-4 pts?  lioncub: 2@D. I treat 2@D as a waiting bid.

South: I am clueless what to bid now. There are no bids which I like.  So I choose 2@C and wait for his critique.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|

nt|
Lioncub: Have you heard me say sometimes there is no good bid........you have to make .....THE BEST BID AVAILABLE.   Here South has no perfect bid............my choice would be rebid 2@H. South has the singleton spade......so may be able to ruff spades.....partner of course will expect 4-card support.
My bidding: 1@C-1@H-? 
                    2@H- P  I always bid all 4-card suits up the line.                                            
 
Kib: Would 2@H fare better than 2@c?  lioncub: Nope. But 2@H is better than re-bidding 2@C on just a 5-card suit. 
|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


pc|D9|mc|0|
nt|2@D re-bid by South would be a reverse bid showing 17+.  A reverse bid forces partner to respond at the 3 level if he prefers first bid suit.

Kib: I would have bid 1@D then 2@C.  lioncub: That would be wrong with a capital R. That would show 5 diamonds......and partner will correct to 2@D with 2 clubs and 3 diamonds.  ALWAYS WITHOUT FAIL........OPEN 5-CARD SUIT.   Bid length not strength.
-------------------
lioncub:Lead of a diamond is correct, (the longest suit) BUT lead the correct card which is the 6 (4th highest)

Lead of the ace of club and then another club hoping for a ruff if partner has the ace of trumps is acceptable. I prefer the unbid major, which would call for the lead of 5@S.|

Kib: ? criteria for 3@C bid?  lioncub: good 6 or 7-card suit.
Kib: Not worried about lack of heart stoppers?  lioncub: No room to find out............bid what you think you can make.

Lioncub: Lead of a heart is correct, BUT lead the 10…..top of interior sequence.

lioncub: Xmas came early.  SIX/FIVE COME ALIVE.  East should open using  rule of 20.....nothing to be ashamed of. Kib: did South reverse ? lioncub: yes it IS a reverse.....this is what I mean by 6/5 come alive.  Treat it as a monster hand,,,,hoping you find a fit with one of your suits.
lioncub: my bidding : 1@C-1@D-4@H-P
                                   P -4@S - 5@C - ?  With a double fit the choice of double instead of 5@C was poor. With double fit, always push a bit further. This will give North a problem…to pass or bid 5@S. 
lioncub: North/South have one @D and two @C losers.|

nt|
lioncub: 1@H-1@S
lioncub: 1NT-?  Now, South knows they are going to be in game  BUT......what game?  3NT or 4@S.
lioncub: So over 1NT bid 3@C  asking partner to show 3-card spade suit if he has it and to bid 3NT if he has not.  1NT bid only denies 4-card spade suit. So when you bid 3@S over 3@C.......you can only be showing 3-card support

lioncub: so bidding is ................1@H-1@S;     1NT-3@C;    3@S-4@S
|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


pc|C3|mc|0|
nt|
Kib: choosing between 3NT or 4 @S. is hard
lioncub: No.  3@C is not asking partner to choose.  It is DEMANDING HE SHOWS 3-CARD SPADE SUIT.  Using checkback..........then the bid is 2@C over 1NT.  Either way is fine. 3@C is guaranteeing enough for game.......so min is 13.  But 11 needed for checkback.  all South wants to know about is if you have 3 spades or not
----------------
lioncub: lead is fine.

nt|
lioncub: 3@D was OK.  Note no 3-cards in either major.  BUT West should bid 3NT.  It should be easier to make 9 tricks than 11.
 
Kib: Is the rule for 3 preempt similar to 2?  lioncub: yes. 7-card suit always open 3.   My rule is holding no worse than KJ9 in that suit.

lioncub: With North hand I make another bid such as 2@C after 1NT. After 2@C I will PASS.  Opps have shown min values.
 
Kib: In NT  which is a better lead...P’s suit or from our longest/strongest??
lioncub: If you don’t lead partner's suit.......you better have a great reason for not doing so.
|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


pc|SJ|mc|0|
nt|
Kib: When could North double an opening? 
lioncub: When North has no 5-card suit.........but support for majors and tolerance for other minor.  Overcall.........shows a good suit. See my article on doubles.......on my web site ^*Hwww.zyworld.com/lioncub/Doubles1.htm^*N and ^*Hwww.zyworld.com/lioncub/Doubles2.htm^*N
-----------

lioncub: Lead should clearly be the J@S. Partner has made an overcall, which you should know shows a good suit.

nt|
lioncub: 1@S - ?  West hand is the right shape for take out double.........but...........not enough points. And North?  After a double –PASS. After a pass by West, however, North should bid 1NT as he cannot pass 1S and is not strong enough to bid at the 2 level (needing 10 points to do so.) South of course is right to bid 2@S regardless of bids by West.

lionub: my bidding:
	1@S-p-1NT-p
	2@S-p-p-p

lioncub: 1@H-? Who knows MICHAELS CUE BIDS?  You all will now. 
1@H-2@H  This shows 5 spades and 5 of an unknown minor.  Over a minor.........eg..........1@D-2@D shows both majors. Points needed in the 2 suits.  Read about it on my site at ^*Hwww.zyworld.com/lioncub/Michaels_Cue_Bids.htm.^*N

nt|lioncub: As the bidding went........... PLEASE REMEMBER RULES FOR COMPETITIVE BIDDING.  DIRECT RAISES ARE PREEMPTIVE......YOU SHOW 10+ with cue bids. So S should be bidding 4@H  remembering the LAW.
 
lioncub: My bidding is  1@H-2@H-4@H-4@S

lioncub: Good lead.
