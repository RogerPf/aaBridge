Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play…….or both.

^d @H@2Who :|CP||AT| I am kia with BBO nickname "nome".|cp|8|at| 
                                                                       
Why  :|CP||AT| I like to have a movies representing the teaching sessions as close to the live event as possible @e@3so I can review them later. I am delighted that you can also enjoy it.|cp|8|at| 

What :|CP||AT| lioncub's Friday teaching sessions is being presented here.|cp|8|at|

How  :|CP||AT| In this presentation I have combined the hands from lioncub's Friday Teaching Sessions with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed and edited from the chat. He has approved the bridge information in this movie. You will see the four hands and the auction by the participants and after Allan has asked for a "Lead and Claim." The claim is meaningless and is made so his critique can begin. |cp|8|at| 

Goal :|CP||AT| The emphasis is presenting lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  Incorrect grammar and spelling are tolerated. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. All the links in this file are clickable - they turn color when you move your cursor over them.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site. |FP|2|AT|

The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section. |FP||CP|8|AT|
 

Please help me improve these movies by sending suggestions to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.|CP||FP||AT|

lioncub: Correct lead is the 3@H - partner's suit.

1@H-2NT. This is the classic unusual NT showing both minors. The 3@H bid from West is a good bid.  However, North misunderstood and nothing more to say. North should have passed the 3@H. And everyone passes 3@H. However, for the sake of teaching North would bid 3@C if West haden't bid. Then South can decide to pass (As in this case ) or bid @D. |

NT|
Nome: The following is from Allan's web site at ^*Hwww.zyworld.com/lioncub/Unusual_2NT.htm^*N on unusual 2NT|cP|8|at|

"With shapely hands it is important to be able to compete, providing you have little or no defence in the opponent’s suits. Therefore if the opponents open 1 of a major, and you hold 5/5 in the minors, you need to get into the action immediately with a bid of 2NT. Your points will be in the 2 suits and NOT in either of the majors." |

lioncub: Correct suit to lead..........but wrong card. Leading from 3 to an honour...........lead the 4@D.

Rule of 20 opener from Kia. Well done. 1@H overcall is correct. Please note a 2@H overcall would show a weak 6-carder. 2@C is a fine bid. From east, either 3@H or 4@H would be fine. 3@H is the bid that makes. Well done all of you.|

NT|lioncub: Bad lead. 5@H the unbid major is usually best. Now, to the bidding as was done.

^C1@D-1@S-? Now, sit with South and think. Spades are the agreed suit, so now we add points for shape. Add just the one point for the doubleton. So 12+1=13. Still just a min hand. Then tell partner that by bidding 2@S. Of course N is strong enough to bid game  -13+1=14.|

denim3008: Does 1@d indicate you have 4 diamonds?|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |

lioncub: Nope. The ONLY time that 1@D is NOT a 4-carder is when the hand is 4/4/3/2.|

NT|lioncub: Good lead. 

Over 2@D, W with only doubleton support has an impossible bid. Can't bid 2@H..........that would be a reverse bid showing 17+. Then is left with choice of 2NT........showing 12-14, or 3@C, or last choice would be 3@D. My choice would be 2NT which would deny 3-card support. Note that 3NT would make here. However, over 1@C what should North bid? Even vulnerable.........I still make the same bid.........a near solid 7-card suit.........I bid 4@S and  now let the opps guess what to bid.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|  
lioncub: A reverse bid shows a second suit that is shorter and higher ranking than the first and has 17+ points.............AND FORCES PARTNER TO SHOW PREFERENCE TO FIRST BID SUIT AT THE 3 LEVEL.
^C1@c-2@d
^C2@h IS A REVERSE because IF PARTNER PREFERS CLUBS..........HE HAS TO BID 3@C. 
For more please look on web site at ^*Hwww.zyworld.com/lioncub/Reverse_Bidding.htm^*N.|

lioncub: If going to lead a club............lead the J top of interior sequence. Read my article on lead on my web site at ^*Hwww.zyworld.com/lioncub/Leads.htmarticle^*N.   East just 9 HCP. But upgrade that spade holding. That sequence of QJ108 is worth one extra point. Now, you have 10+6+4=20 and using rule 20 you can open 1@S. From there you should be able to reach 6@S. You need the diamond finesse to make 6. Without club lead then it is easy. My article on hand evaluation states that if you have a holding of 10/9 together with a higher honour then add one extra point. Look it up at ^*Hwww.zyworld.com/lioncub/Hand_Evaluation.htm^*N.|

Shirley_RG: Please would you give the sequence of bidding to reach 6@S.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


AT|
^C1@S-2NT   which is Jacoby 2NT showing 4-card support and minimum of a game going hand.
^C3@C-3@H    3@C shows singleton. 3@H is cue bid
^C4@D-4@H    Both are cue bids
^C4@S- P    East has nothing more to say. |

lioncub: Correct lead.
This is very important. Biggest tip of the session. Read, digest, and forever remember it. WHEN OPPS OPEN A SUIT, AND YOU HAVE A GOOD HOLDING IN THAT SUIT...........ALWAYS PASS FIRST TIME UNLESS YOU HAVE A 1NT OVERCALL. However having doubled let us ask North what would you bid if partner opens 1@S -with a 4-card suit. First re-evaluate your hand with adding points for shape. 8HCP +1+1=10 and bid 3@S asking if partner has extra, to bid 4@S. A bid of 1@S from N shows 0-6 points. However as bidding went..............E found another bid of 2@D.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT|
lioncub: Over 2@D?  South has min hand for his double.........SO MUST PASS TO TELL PARTNER THIS. Now my bidding:
^C1@H-p-1NT-p
^C2@D-p-3@D ? 
Now, this is looking good for North. Partner marked with singleton diamond,,,,,,,and must have spades suit not mentioned. I bid 3@S as North. Note favourable vulnerability. And S will bid game. Next, big tip. TAKE TIME TO THINK and analyse after every bid, Don't be rushed by opps.|

lioncub: NEVER lead from 4 to the J. N. nearly always costs a trick. Here it works.........usually it won't. My lead would be the 7@C giving nothing away. 
  
1@C-? The bid here from East is 3NT,,,,,,,whether playing inverted minors or not. The hand does not have 4-card major, and showing exactly 13-15 points.|

lioncub: Excellent lead. Again the unbid major.  
1@S-2@D-? North used good judgement  to just bid 2@S showing min hand and a 6-card suit. South your first choice 3@C before changing it to 2NT was best. Then North could have bid 4SF of 3@H with South showing doubleton only by 
bidding 3@S and North place the auction at 4@S.  
^C1@S-2@D
^C2@S-4@S|

lioncub: MUST lead the ace clubs.
This is a hand that requires thinking.  E avoided NT contract.........odds on that she does not hold the King clubs. With the K@C East would have bid 3NT over 3@D. 
^C1@H-1@S
^C2@D -3@D  Super bid by Mick. I mean stopping at 3. Now East just look at your hand.  You have 4 losers but you have a solid heart suit. Just bid what you think you  can make. Bid 4@H. If Mick really hates it, he will then bid 5@D. |
