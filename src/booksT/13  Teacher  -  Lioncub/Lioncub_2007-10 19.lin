^d @H@2Lioncub’s bidding session is held every Friday in the BIL at noon NY time. 3 Hands @e@3are bid with 4 volunteers and then change. Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play…….or both. Feel free to ask any questions that are bridge related.|

^d @e@2In this presentation we have combined the movie of the hands from lioncub's Friday @e@3Teaching Session with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed version of chat log transcript.  

The emphasis is presenting to you lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  We did not focus on correctness of the grammar or the spelling.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. Clicking the first will move you forward and clicking the second will take you back. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. 

Further, all the links in this file are clickable - it turns blue when you move your cursor over it.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site.




Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

lioncub: With good trump holding.........lead your long suit. 5@C is the lead. |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at|
Now the bidding.
      Open lowest 4-card minor suit;
      Or open lowest 3 card minor.
      1@D opener will always show 4-card suit EXCEPT with this one shape hand of 4/4/3/2.  
This is to avoid opening 1@C with just a doubleton.
Next point is this..............BID ALL 4-CARD SUITS UP THE LINE. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|
So Geoff of course should bid 1@S  and S would raise to 2@S and all pass. Reason for opening 1@C with 4/4 in the minors is this. If you open 1@D you could easily miss a club fit at the one level. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|
doldridg: 1@D was correct in SAYC, though, right? |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|
lioncub: yes BBO recommends 1@D with 4/4. My recommendation is different as in many areas. Do as you think is best for you. |

moonjohn: Would it be wrong for West to overcall clubs? |

lioncub: lead is acceptable. In this case however, 9@H works better. |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


at|
lioncub: 2@S by W is best bid. Then and excellent double by Geoff showing both minors. Passing for E cannot be best option. With good heart support should bid 3@S  or just bid 3@H. |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|
East: 2@s doubled is game so safe I decided to leave it. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


at|
lioncub: that is why the double must be for the minors. If he had spades...........he would pass.........and wait for reopening double from partner. Over the double E must bid either 3 or 4 spades. Let me give a big tip
“ALWAYS be very careful with your bidding if you hold 3 cards in the enemy suit.” Shall we move on?|

lioncub: lead is correct. We can under lead the ace in NT.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


at|
lioncub: 1C-1@H-1@S and then the master bid of 2@D. This is fourth suit forcing and should be alerted. The 4SF bid says nothing about the suit....but requests more info from partner. This is it in order of  preference
     Show 3 card support for the first bid suit.............next; 
     show stop in diamonds with 2NT.....partner may have small doubleton;
     or with neither of those then some other bid. |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|
lioncub: BUT as the bidding went...Jimmy now bid 4NT.....which is a quantatative bid....asking partner to bid 6 with 13/14. With that bad 13 W is right to pass. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


at|
lioncub: bidding should have proceeded after 2@D
         2@H--4@C
         4@S--?
lioncub: up to E now. Does he bid 6 or not. That is a judgement call.......no right or wrong answer. 6@H is a 50% slam depending on position of A@D. Study this hand at your leisure. Very instructive. Move on.|

lioncub: seat belts fastened? My good friend David is first in the firing zone. My rules for opening weak 2s:
     6-9 points...........6 card suit no worse than KJ9
     dkgrab: NO OUTSIDE ACES !!!
     no 3 cards in the other major and no strong defensive tricks. |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt|
lioncub: David did NOT have 3 cards in the other major so was not entirely a bad bid. The reason for these rules,,,,,is so that partner will know what to expect. |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


at|
lioncub: therefore there was no point in the bid of 3@C. Where are you going? However..........the bid by W was great. Note the vulnerability. Over the double................N should now show his club support,,,,,and bid 4@C. Well done to Jimmy to have worked out that partner is showing the red suits. Let’s move on.|

lioncub: 1NT-2@D-? Here is the super accept in action. These are my suggestions for super accept: 
         * with min hand bid 3@H
         * other bids show a maximum
         * no small doubletons. bid 2NT
         * with small doubletons bid the suit. |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt|
lioncub: so my bidding would be:
1NT-2@D
3@D..........showing max with small doubleton
S signs off in 3@H. It can play in 3@H with a weak hand. |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


at|
boater: so I bid 2@S or 3@D? |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


at|  lioncub: You bid 2@D  and partner responds 3@D and S signs off in 3@H. Time to change and next board. |

lioncub: 1@H-?  Most people would bid 2NT showing 5/5 in the minors. However Ally chose a clever bid knowing it was unlikely that this would be passed. And as she foresaw the bidding came back to her. I would now bid 4@C showing the enormous playing potential. However, 3@C prompted a bid of 3@H from E which N doubles.........and why not.........he has 3 certain tricks......and hopes for at least 2 from partner. Let’s change quickly for last 3 boards. |

     3NT |

nt| 
lioncub: As the bidding went, W rebid 2NT........showing 18/19 points. E has 6 HCP. BUT............the 10/9 combination with a higher honour is worth an extra point so bid 3NT. my recommendation always bid up the line. And now move to the next board please. |

E opener should be 1NT. BUT !!!!! S should have opened 1@S. The hand satisfies rule of 20. It all went a bit astray after that. Bidding should have been:
1@S-P-3@S all pass.|

pg| ***** 63 ***** |

^-
Remember, just because you have a 5-card suit does not mean that it is the best spot.  Partner may only have 2, so a No Trump contract could be best. |
pg| ***** 64 ***** |

The ideal situation is when you have 8 points, (or 11 with a weak No Trump).

And now 2NT will have told partner you have 5 hearts and 8 points inviting him to go on if he has a maximum. You have a minimum of 23 points , so 2NT should not be in any danger if he passes with a minimum. |
pg| ***** 67 ***** |

^*bYou always transfer with a 6 card suit, weak or strong.|
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


nt||tu||at|
^-Your partner has introduced a transfer sequence and you have FOUR CARD SUPPORT. |
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


at|
^-
At this stage you do not know if partner is weak, strong or even invitational. In view of the huge fit with you having 4-card support for his 5 or 6-card suit it makes sense to tell partner this, rather than tamely just completing the transfer at the 2 level.|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


at|

Why not give him a complete picture of your hand and show not only how many points you have, but also whether you have any doubletons? |
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


at|

This should assist him in evaluating his hand, including showing how many possible losers there are in a suit, and fixing the level of the contract. |
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


at|

For example partner may have Axxx in a side suit , and if you show a doubleton in this suit then the maximum losers in this suit will be ONE! |
pg| ***** 73 ***** |

Don't worry about getting too high with few points. You have a nine-card fit! Opponents will surely have a fit somewhere. The risk is minimal. |
