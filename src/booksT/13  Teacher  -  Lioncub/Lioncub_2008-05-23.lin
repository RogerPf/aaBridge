^d @H@2Lioncub’s bidding session is held every Friday in the BIL at noon NY time. 3 Hands @e@3are bid with 4 volunteers and then change. Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play…….or both. Feel free to ask any questions that are bridge related.

^d @H@2What  :|CP||AT| For my later review I like to have a BBO movie representing lioncub's teaching session as close @e@3to the live event as possible. I am delighted that you can also enjoy it.|cp|8|at| 

How  :|CP||AT| In this presentation I have combined the hands from lioncub's Friday Teaching Sessions with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed and edited from the chat. He has approved the bridge information in this movie. You will see the four hands and the auction by the participants and after Allan has asked for a "Lead and Claim." The claim is meaningless and is made so his critique can begin. |cp|8|at| 

Goal :|CP||AT| The emphasis is to present lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  Incorrect grammar and spelling are tolerated. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. All the links in this file are clickable - they turn color when you move your cursor over them.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site. |FP|2|AT|

The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at|^*B HELP^*N |cp||FP|2|at|box at the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section. |FP||CP|8|AT|
 

Please help me improve these movies by sending suggestions to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.|CP||FP||AT|

                                               
                                              Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

^B@2Now, assume that you are sitting South. Review your hand and decide what bid you would have made if you actually were there. Write it down and click the forward arrow. You may find that your bid may be different from the player in time. Continue until the auction is over and there is a lead and claim. Then you will see all four hands. The claim is immaterial and is done so Allan can start his critique and recommendations. Then you can compare your bidding with his recommendations. It is as good as being there. Don't forget that unlike the actual player you would be playing all the boards. Good Luck.|

^B@2lioncub: Lead is correct.  Up to one heart........easy bidding. Note that neither N or S have yet shown the strength of their hands. Far too dangerous for East to come in with one spade. However as the bidding went South should think about SUPPORT DOUBLE. Over 1@S............a double would show exactly 3-card support and N may be tempted to pass that double. My bidding with EW silent would be:
1@C-1@D
1@H- 3@C

^B@2lioncub: Good lead. Let us see what they showed with their bids. By bidding 2NT, E showed a balanced hand with 18/19 points.  W was entitled to bid 4@H..........expecting partner to have at least 2 hearts. W showed 5 hearts and 4 spades with his bidding. BID 4-CARD SUITS UP THE LINE. What W should have done? Simple, with two 5-card suits bid the HIGHER one first,,,,,,in order to bid the other one next time. So bidding would be
1@D-1@S
3@C-3@H
3@S-4@S  Next board.|

^B@2lioncub: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, partner has doubled.........demanding a spade lead. Double is for 1st bid suit. An unwise double which happened to work. Now, the bidding 1@S-2@H which is fine so far.  3@D.......shows 17+............the natural bid should be 2NT. And W must show his 6-card suit.........only showed 5 so far. The bidding should be:
1@S-2@H 
2NT-3@H
4@H      making 5. Okay next hand please.|

^B@2lioncub: I recommend a trump lead here. However, the 10 is an honour......so if leading clubs, lead the 5. In our system we play bidding 4-card suits up the line and forcing to 1NT. The bidding should be
1@C-1@D
1@S-2@S
4@S.   Note the 1@S bid is forcing. Change please.|

^B@2lioncub: The lead of the J was terrible. Correct suit.............BUT lead lowest to an honour. The lead of the jack presented declarer with no losers in that suit. Now to the rules for opening weak 2s. Suit never worse than KJ9, never good defensive tricks and never hold 4 cards in a outside major. my bidding:
lioncub: p-p-p-1@S
lioncub: p-1NT-p-3@H
lioncub: p-4@H-p-p-p   Making 5. Lose a heart and a club. |

^B@2lioncub: Correct lead. Very poor overcall.........suit not good enough......and has scattered values in other suits.  As the bidding went, W should double 3@D...........showing the extra values and E would bid 3@S, and the bidding would go. My recommended bidding is:
1@s-P-2@s-P
3@s-P-P-P   Move to the next board please.|

^B@2lioncub: Correct lead. 1@C-1@S-p_? This is the rule. When responding to partner's overcal  ALL DIRECT RAISES ARE WEAK AND PREMPTIVE.........SHOWING UNDER 7 POINTS. So 2@S or 3@S or 4@S are all weak in points. You show trump support and good 9 or 10 points plus with a cue bid. Thus, the bid after 1@S is 2@C. Note this says nothing about the suit that is cued which shows the support and the point count.  You don't know the strength of partner's overcall. But you can tell him yours. The cue bid always shows a MINIMUM of good 9 points passed or not with no upper limit.  W should be doubling 3@C. One off is 200 beating any part score. Next. |

^B@2lioncub: Lead fine.  This is so important. We play that an overcall is guaranteed to show a good sui and we must trust our partner.  1@H-1@S-2@H-?. With 3- card support with an ace and a doubleton nothing to think about..........MUST  bid 2@S. Your partner has guaranteed a good 5-carder. Then partner will bid 4@S.  He still bid up to 3 on his own. Over 3@H bid by N, a better bid is to double. This can be nothing other than showing a better hand than a simple overcall. |

^B@2lioncub: Correct lead. Now, what does the 2@D show. It shows diamond support with 6 to 9 points and on the way to bidding it shows the 4-card heart suit. 2@D in that sequence was a limit bid showing max of 9 points. This is a rare hand suitable for a strong jump shift. Over 1@D.........bid 2@H. Good suit with trump support. We do not do WJS unless in competition. My bidding: 
1@D-1@H
1@S-2@C  That would be 4SF. Then 2NT............that would deny 3 hearts and 4NT from E. |
