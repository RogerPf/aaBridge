^d @H@2Lioncub’s bidding session is held every Friday in the BIL at noon NY time. 3 Hands @e@3are bid with 4 volunteers and then change. Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play…….or both. Feel free to ask any questions that are bridge related.

^d @H@2What  :|CP||AT| For my later review I like to have a BBO movie representing lioncub's teaching session as close @e@3to the live event as possible. I am delighted that you can also enjoy it.|cp|8|at| 

How  :|CP||AT| In this presentation I have combined the hands from lioncub's Friday Teaching Sessions with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed and edited from the chat. He has approved the bridge information in this movie. You will see the four hands and the auction by the participants and after Allan has asked for a "Lead and Claim." The claim is meaningless and is made so his critique can begin. |cp|8|at| 

Goal :|CP||AT| The emphasis is to present lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  Incorrect grammar and spelling are tolerated. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. All the links in this file are clickable - they turn color when you move your cursor over them.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site. |FP|2|AT|

The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at|^*B HELP^*N |cp||FP|2|at|box at the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section. |FP||CP|8|AT|
 

Please help me improve these movies by sending suggestions to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.|CP||FP||AT|

                                               
                                              Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

You may find that your bid may be different from the player in time. Continue until the auction is over and there is a lead and claim. Then you will see all four hands. The claim is immaterial and is done so Allan can start his critique and recommendations. Then you can compare your bidding with his recommendations. It is as good as being there.

^B@2lioncub: Unbid major.........so lead is correct. In this auction there is no need for E to double........going to get top score without a double. First principles...........AN OVERCALL MUST SHOW A GOOD SUIT. Particularly so with this unfavorable vulnerability. After the overcall it is impossible for partner to stop short of game now. Opening bid is too strong for 1NT--18. South should pass. However, North made a clever bid after the CAPP by South. If he bids 2@D.......it is just possible that partner has a 6-card diamond suit, and would pass. This N hand will not come up again for a hundred years.|

lioncub: My tip for determining how many points your partner likely to have. Assume 12 points for opener: add your point and deduct this total from 40. Allocate half to partner and half to LHO. So.... (12+20)- 40 = 8 Therefore, expect partner to have 4, which would be enough with your 20 to make game. |

^B@2lioncub:  Lead should be the K@C.  1@D-p-1@H-X  All are correct so far. West now should make a support double.........showing exactly 3 hearts. Partner may have just 4 and West has no ruffing power in a heart contract. North COULD compete with either 1@s or 2@S depending on bid by West. BUT not very good support in terms of HCP in the black suits. |

^B@2lioncub: Correct lead. Interesting choice of bids. North has 17HCP with good 5 card suit. However that Qx of clubs is a negative aspect. So I would only open 1NT. But as the bidding went 1@D-p-p-2@C. Not a bad idea.......with being able to rebid 2@H over a possible 2@D bid by opener. 2@D should be the rebid.........showing extra strength. That Q@C is definitely not worth anything now. Even over 3@D.........I would still now bid 3@H with the West hand. Questions? |
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT|
Kib: Why not balancing X by West?
Kib: Why not 2NT by West to show both Hearts and clubs? |
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: Both not correct. Balancing double should be flatter.......bidding either clubs or hearts is better. 2NT is not unusual.........in that position. It would show 20/21 points. |

^B@2lioncub: Lead a small spade.........not the jack. Okay, TIP OF THE WEEK........MARK WELL. FIVE LEVEL BIDS BELONG TO THE OPPOSITION.  Not always works......but normally is a good rule to follow. Here South bid his hand to the full when he bid 4@H. There is no reason for West to bid 1@S. Has only a poor 4-card suit..........much better to pass. My bidding would be:
1@D-X-p-1@H
X-4@H-?  Now there is a good case to bid 4@S. |

^B@2lioncub: Lead is ok. With a balanced 17 points then a 1NT overcall is fine. The 2@D bid however should be to play. However, with 9 points opposite an opening bid...........my strong suggestion for East is to double. My bidding:
1@C - 1NT -X - 2@S
P - P - 3@D - P
3@H - 3@S - PPP. |

^B@2West: 2@H transfer, still on after dbl?. |
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: transfers are off once opps make a bid. It is on with a double.........off with a suit bid. |
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


AT|
East: I thought double over 1NT would mean I had majors. |
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: Nope. Double just shows you to have balance of points.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


AT| 
South: So transfers are on  if East doubles? |
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: Yep. Can you see the reason why? The 2@D bid has stopped you using 2@D as a transfer to hearts. |
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT|
^B@2Kib: I don't understand why you don't show the transfer is on by bidding  hearts over the double? |
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: It is very much simpler if you adopt the policy of all system bids being off,,,if opps interfere over a double with a suit bid. But keep systems on if they double........a double takes up no bidding space. |

^B@2lioncub: There is no good lead here. South has to make a waiting bid with her first bid and has natural bid of 2@D. 5-card suit..........leaves door open for partner to bid 2@H if he has 4-card suit. My bidding:
1@S-2@D
2@S-2NT  Now is right to pass this.  3@C over 2@H shows a much bigger hand. 2@S is ............the best bid available. Questions?|

^B@2lioncub: correct lead. In my opinion, the suits in West hand are not good enough for a Michaels bid. However. as the bidding went.....then East should bid 4@H, not 3@H. My better recommendation would be:
1@D-p-p-X
2@c.-2@S-p-3@d
p-3@H-p-4@H -P-P-P.   |
