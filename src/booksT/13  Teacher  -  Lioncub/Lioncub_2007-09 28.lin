^d @H@2Lioncub’s bidding session is held every Friday in the BIL at noon NY time. 3 Hands @e@3are bid with 4 volunteers and then change. Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play…….or both. Feel free to ask any questions that are bridge related.

^d @e@2In this presentation we have combined the movie of the hands from lioncub's Friday @e@3Teaching Session with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed version of chat log transcript.  

The emphasis is presenting to you lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  We did not focus on correctness of the grammar or the spelling.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. Clicking the first will move you forward and clicking the second will take you back. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. 

Further, all the links in this file are clickable - it turns blue when you move your cursor over it.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site.




Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

lioncub: 1@H - ?
lioncub: I say show a 5-card suit in preference to doubling.  South doubled because he wanted to show the spade suit.......wrong thinking.  Suppose partner had bid 2@D? what then?  To bid 2@S now would show a 17+ hand with very good 5-carder or better. That is why 2@C is the bid. Partner will bid 2@H........cue bid showing limit raise in clubs or better.  NOW South can bid 2@S  showing more than min hand.|

lioncub: important lesson here:
	1@S - 2@H
	  2NT- ?
East must say to himself.........."partner knows I have 5-carder in hearts and at least 10 points. Have I anything extra?"  The answer is NO.  If West has enough for game.......knowing his partner has min of 10,,,,,,,he would not  make a limit bid of 2NT.  Therefore...........East must pass 2NT.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


Nt| 
SueM: shouldn't east show his outside aces?|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|
lioncub: why Sue?  He has shown his 10 points........he has nothing extra to show. But, I see where you are coming from Sue. You are talking about cue bidding.  You only do this once trumps are agreed,,,,,,,,and  have game values......and looking for slam.|

lioncub: 1@D opening bid was fine.............then the wheels came off.  Double now guarantees both majors......or the worse way is 3 cards in one with 2 of top 3 honors.  So Geoff should pass. But he doubled.........and now to East.  The first thing he MUST do is to redouble......this will tell partner he has at least 10 points.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|
Next up is South.  He must  believe that partner has a 4-card spade suit.........therefore bid 1@S  with just 3 points?  Yes...........the void in hearts is priceless.  But he chose to double.......what does that mean? I would take it as penalty.......exposing a possible psychic bid by East.  West is happy with whatever they bid.........with those 3 hearts.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt|
Partner has told you he has 4 spades and tolerance for the other minor. South decides to show his  club suit after the 3@H bid is passed round to him???????????  How can this possibly be right?  North passed the 3@H bid..........showing min take out. East/West so far were in  A PART SCORE............. look what happens when you compete foolishly. You pushed them into 4@H game which is unbeatable and probably make an overtrick.|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |

anco: 5c good save.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


at|
lioncub: a good save is to pass 3@H. I repeat that which I often say WITH A FLAT HAND UP TO 15 POINTS.........LEARN TO PASS IN THE FIRST INSTANT.|

lioncub: now lets have a look.  Sue?  Why pass 1@D?|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


at|
SueM: I wanted to show my hearts  but only had 9 points  not enough to overcall.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


at|
lioncub: am I missing something?  Partner opens 1@D and you have 9 points.|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


at|
SueM: I thought needed 10 to  change suits??|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


at| 
lioncub: Your bid is 1@H.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt| 
lioncub: At the 2 level you need 10 points. At the one level you only need 6 points to bid. Partner then bids 2@D over the 1@S bid showing extra.  Lets see how it should have gone:
	1@D- p -1@H - 1@S
	4@H- p – p    -   p
when N hears partner bid 1@H that now becomes the agreed trump suit, so add points for shape -- 19 points plus 3 for singleton........less 2 for the useless Q@C which comes to 20.  This is enough opposite a min of 6 points from partner.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|
Spinman: why not consider slam?|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


at| 
lioncub: my suggested bid of 4@H showed 20 points........does not stop South from going on. IF West had opened the bidding with 1@S, then North would double first. Then, if partner does not bid hearts,,,,would jump in diamonds.|

lioncub: Now let us look at the bidding? Of course the response to 1@D should be 1@H.  West probably worried about missing a spade fit. The answer is.............don’t worry. If partner.....DOES NOT BID 1@S OVER 1@H then there is no spade fit.

My bidding would be..............1@D - 1@H
                                 1@S - 4@S
11 HCP + 3 for the singleton =13 points. On my bidding then the 7@C would be correct.|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


pc|C5|mc|0|nt|
lioncub: Bad lead. Top of doubleton is to be avoided.......unless nothing else is available.  Unbid major is best. Lead should be 2@H.|

lioncub: 1@D – X - ?  Before bidding East should consider the North hand.  He is showing the majors. My choice for East would be 1NT.  However, over 1@S -  what should South do?  Partner has asked  to bid... if possible.  I bid 2@C.  Partner will not expect much from you.  But having passed........not a terrible thing to do........you have another chance.  I see your reasoning in bidding 2@H.  BUT  partner cannot have more than 4@H otherwise he would have bid 1@H with a 5-card suit in the first place.  So why not bid 2@C?|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|
My bidding recommendation: 
	1@D-x-1NT-2@C
	p-p-2@D-?     

Now the rest depends  on who is the bravest.  Probably NS can make 3@C.|

lioncub: why can’t W open 2@S? As I have said it many times,  NEVER OPEN A MAJOR WEAK 2 WITH 3 CARDS IN OTHER MAJOR......IN 1ST OR 2ND SEAT. Its all in my book “BETTER BIDDING =BETTER BRIDGE.” Look it up at my web site ^*Hwww.zyworld.com/lioncub/Home.htm  ^*N |

lioncub: 2@C is a bit iffy.  But the 6th card in the suit. Super bid by West  remembering that ANY DIRECT RAISE SHOWES UNDER 10 POINTS.  WITH 10+ would cue bid. East is now not tempted to go on.  Very well bid Foxy.|

lioncub: 1@H-2@C-3@C|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


 
nt|
lioncub: 4@H is the recommended bid to make........note this is over an intervening bid. You bid  just 2@H without intervention. The point of the 4@H bid is to bid to the upper limit of the hand.......and forcing the opponents to have to make a decision at a high level.|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


pc|D9|mc|13|nt|
lioncub: lead is fine.  Remembering we don’t lead doubletons.......therefore partner will know it is a singleton.|

robzim: Allan -- what should South lead if she had an extra diamond and one less club -- because she shouldn't lead away from an ace -- and shouldn't lead a doubleton -- ?|

lioncub:  1@D-1@H-X -- So far it is fine. Double showing 4 spades.......well done. South though should show heart support by bidding 2 or 3 Hearts. Now West?  You do not have 4 spades.  So just rebid your lovely diamond suit. You can bid 2@D after the double. However, my bidding:
    1D-1H-X—3H
    P—-P --P    With this bidding sequence South has to pass.|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


pc|D4|mc|13|nt| 
lioncub: Bad lead.  With that strong spade holding.....you should not be looking for a ruff. Your partner redoubled.......showing some values in the other 2 suits  or that is what it showed.
