^d @H@2Lioncub’s bidding session is held every Friday in the BIL at noon NY time. 3 Hands @e@3are bid with 4 volunteers and then change. Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play…….or both. Feel free to ask any questions that are bridge related.

^d @H@2What  :|CP||AT| For my later review I like to have a BBO movie representing lioncub's teaching session as close @e@3to the live event as possible. I am delighted that you can also enjoy it.|cp|8|at| 

How  :|CP||AT| In this presentation I have combined the hands from lioncub's Friday Teaching Sessions with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed and edited from the chat. He has approved the bridge information in this movie. You will see the four hands and the auction by the participants and after Allan has asked for a "Lead and Claim." The claim is meaningless and is made so his critique can begin. |cp|8|at| 

Goal :|CP||AT| The emphasis is to present lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  Incorrect grammar and spelling are tolerated. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. All the links in this file are clickable - they turn color when you move your cursor over them.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site. |FP|2|AT|

The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at|^*B HELP^*N |cp||FP|2|at|box at the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section. |FP||CP|8|AT|
 

Please help me improve these movies by sending suggestions to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.|CP||FP||AT|

                                               
                                              Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

^B@2lioncub: lead of K@D is correct. 
lioncub: bidding is correct.
baifan1986: should East double?
lioncub: not double. Always show a 5-card suit in preference to double.
baifan1986: but his hand is very strong. His bid of one spade shows only 7-16.
lioncub: nope.........the 1@S bid is unlimited. Note if he had a 6-card suit,then double first, and then bid spades.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


NT|
^B@2JohnnyHiLo: however the uncontested double says partner should bid with zero points. West in effect is opening for the takeout doubler and this allows more flexibility.
lioncub: why do you want partner to bid with no points? A double here would force partner to bid 1@H and then what? Double first and then bid spades, not only shows a very strong hand.........BUT!!! it also promises a good 6-card suit.  You have to make the BEST BID AVAILABLE  and my view is that 1@S is the best. |

^B@2lioncub: correct lead. 
lioncub: 1@S-?
lioncub: after 1@S South has no other bid to even think about than PASS. Suit again too poor for an over call at two level. If S had a 6th diamond then just about worth bidding. And West on the bidding as IS again has just one bid to make................pass. West is too weak in points to bid over 2@d. |
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


NT|
^B@2However, North you must support partner and  bid 3@D.  Trust your partner. He made a vulnerable overcall. My bidding would be:
         p-p-1@S-p
         1NT-p-2@C-P
         2@H-p-p-p      And the 2@H is the winning bid now. |
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT|	 
^B@2JinxII: why West did not open 2@h ?
lioncub: first of all.........that is NOT a 2@H opener in first seat...........suit is too weak. |
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


AT|
spirit1320: why should S pass instead of bidding 2@d ?
okbkat: What did S tell Partner by Bidding 2D.
lioncub: South has no good bid to make over 1@S.  As I have already explained, the suit is not good enough to bid at the 2 level vulnerable. Any questions? |
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT|
^B@2anyazas: what is the minimum requirement for overcalling at 2 level?
lioncub: MIN REQUIREMENT IS A GOOD SUIT
anyazas: please define good suit
lioncub: KJ10xxx is my min requirement for 2 level vulnerable bid. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT|
^B@2macy1: here the new suit is forcing.
lioncub: not true. In  1@S-1NT-2@C sequence  the 2@C bid is NOT forcing.
sshmj: With the bidding as is would you allow @DK as lead?
lioncub: no the lead is the 2@d |

^B@2lioncub: my choice of lead is the 2@H which  SHOWS A 4-CARD SUIT and  will never cost.
lioncub: bidding was fine
lioncub: W hand is not suitable for stayman
lioncub: the short suit has 2 honours
lioncub: always bid NT with such a hand
lioncub: questions? |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|
^B@2canuck: can you expand on the decision to use stayman or not?
lioncub: I have said this many times. look for 4/4 fit in a major if a chance to give extra trick.........which will be obtained from ruffing. Here the W hand has no short suits which will enable partner to use trumps for ruffing.
MamaDee: but there is no ruffing in  nt contract
lioncub: exactly............and that is the reason for not using stayman. |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT|
^B@2okbkat: Please explain the lead again. 
lioncub: my recommended lead is the 2@H. Don't lead from a hand containing tenaces over the strong hand
MamaDee: what is tenaces?
lioncub: tenace..........is a broken honor sequence as (K Jxx) or (A Qxx) etc. |

lioncub: horrible hand.  4 top losers.
anyazas: can you use drury?
lioncub: not a hand for drury............just bid 4@S
spirit1320: why not 3 spdes with 10 hcp? 
lioncub: plus one each for the 2 doubletons........makes 12 points. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT|
^B@2anyazas: @dKQ stiff Not good values? 
lioncub: again..........10HCP plus points for shape..........one each for the doubletons.......makes 12
MamaDee: when you have 6 clubs good weak opening  what do you do regarding weak  pre-empt.
MamaDee: can't open club.   2 club is strong.
lioncub: pass. Need 7-card suit..........to open 3@C.|

^B@2lioncub: lead is correct. 
lioncub: N has a genuine opener. Let me ask a question. Could S have 11/12 points and pass as dealer?
lioncub: answer is YES. Therefore, keep bidding open and as some of you said,,,,,,,,,,the correct bid by North is 1NT  which S would pass.
sshmj: no, 1nt is 15-17. |
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


AT| lioncub: you are wrong! 1NT rebid shows 12-14. |

^B@2lioncub: ok, now that you have ALL kept quiet during the critique LOL you can now ask questions.
spirit1320: why is 3@D lead correct  when opponents bid Diamond?
lioncub: cos S had passed. No better lead than a trump. |
PG| ***** 33 ***** |

lioncub: yes Johnny
canuck: if not vulnerable would you bid 2@H over the 1 club opener with east hand?

^B@2lioncub: has to be right lead
lioncub: 2@H once again is a poor bid.
lioncub: only 5 in the suit...........but................such good cards in defence
lioncub: W? There is  a huge tip here
lioncub: having opened 1@S your hand has not improved with partner's bid of 1NT. Then, PASS PASS PASS
lioncub: this is serious.........really serious. |
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT|
B@2lioncub: learn the value of pass.............most underused bid in bridge
lioncub: pass here would show ...........nothing more to say
lioncub: the pass.........will enable partner to double the 2@h bid by South which would be penalty
lioncub: can you see how valuable that pass would have been. You hear partner doubling...........and you know you have shown partner min hand............so you can judge that pass is correct. 
lioncub: questions? |
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT|
NT^B@2sshmj: west's hand worth 16 total points, in case of East having 9 hcp, may be 3nt can be played 
lioncub: 15 points not 16. That is what he showed when he opened 1@S  and partner has shown 6-9.........so no game.
sshmj: 15 hcp + 1 long suit point for the 5 card suit in @S.
trafalgar2: aceless hand and @d J not worth 1. 
lioncub: I would prefer to take the money if I was EW |
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT|
^B@2anyazas: Can W open 1NT?
lioncub: no he should not..........not with 5-card major.
analisals: what is your guideline for opening one NT with a 5 card major?
lioncub: my view on 5-card majors...........is that I always open the major
easybridge: but  then the rebidding problem? 
lioncub: I can always find a sensible rebid if I open one of a major. |

mick357: I know you teach open 5 card majors with 15 points, but some teachers are teaching 1nt with 5 card majors, but then I have surmised you must know puppet stayman to do that, is that true?
lioncub: no, Others may do so................not me. I use  puppet only over 2NT. Incidentally I would consider opening 2NT with a 5-card major for that very reason. |
PG| ***** 45 ***** |

^B@2lioncub: Correct lead.  N correct to pass initially.........do not bid with just 4 points
lioncub: listen very carefully...........this is most important. This happens time and time again. You are sitting in 4th seat.......knowing that you need to balance. WITH A BALANCED HAND HOLDING 10-14 POINTS............BID 1NT....even with just 3 little hearts. So the bid by E should be 1NT
lioncub: which will be passed round to N.........who once again should bid 2@H. The double shows shortage in hearts and should hold 4 spades. |
