at|thurston:  Bidding:  A rousing start.
South's 3@D overcall is not the bid I'd recommend  even though nothing much works well.
3@S would be better in theory because games are where the $$$ are and we're not likely to have a diamond game 
but maybe in spades.  
An interesting question is, if S did bid 3@S, should West double?
Preempts are meant to cause errors and you do need to exploit those errors when they occur.
So even though 3@S would be a reasonable overcall, W knows it's going down and should double for penalty.

East might not ruff the second round - no need.
And West probably shouldn’t try to cash the K knowing it's going to be trumped,
and in the end, both the J and 9 of hearts were good for S to use for discards.

sk||
at|thurston: Bidding:  We could spend the next hour talking about the bidding.
Short version: E's 2@H raise was perfect.
The jump to 4@H was ambitious, as the raise could have been weaker - 
I like 2@H by a passed hand to be about 5+-8 so this was a tiptop maximum.

Many partnerships use Drury 2@C by a passed hand to show 
  9-11 hcp with heart support to narrow the range of the direct 2@H.|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


at||
nt|thurston:  Even with reevaluation, the 17 pts your opening is worth, 
is really only worth a game-try opposite a passed hand. 
I'd make a game try with 3@C to say: 
"I need help in clubs for a possible game - what do you have for your 2@H?" 
East would bid game this time -  but could stay lower with a less suitable hand like:
@sxx @hJxx @dKQxx @cJxxx    when game would have no real chance.  |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt||
at|Fit is often more important than total pts - and that's what you can find out about using HSGT. 
Holden47:  So a bid by W of clubs then would not be showing clubs but asking for help in clubs - how do I know that?
thurston:  That's a partnership agreement.
Once a major suit fit has been found, that’s where we're going to play and new suit bids are best used as game trys.   
No need to tell partner "I have great clubs" - serves no real purpose.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt||at|EventHst4:  Always on the third level Paul?
thurston:  Yes, 3-level since there's still room to say "no help" and sign off below game.
For those in the Ottawa-Arnprior area, I'm doing 45 minutes on Help Suit Try at the Arnrpior Sectional in early April. 
Holden47:  So if I had @Cxxx, I would just say 3@H? 
thurston:  Yes, no help = signoff at 3-level of agreed Major.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt||at|duffer66: Could you bid 2@s as HSGT if needed here?
thurston:  Yes, the ask could be at the 2-level after 1@H-2@H-2@S, but the "NO" answer will always be at the 3-level.
Also works after 1@C-1@H-2@H-3@D.

I was thinking a lot too. Any advice here?

at|thurston:  Bidding:  It might not work very well this time but playing 1NT as 15-17, 
I think that should be S's opening.
It's very descriptive of the S hand and acts as a bit of a preempt to discourage W from bidding.

Once 1@C-1@H-P-2@H (all reasonable) , S's competitive double should be for takeout, as it was...
but typically not 4333, as you can’t really support all unbid suits well (or even clubs for that matter).

at|thurston:  Play:  OK, so once everybody has their say and we arrive in 3@H, what might N lead? 
I'm a huge fan of leading partner's suit, but even I would make an exception here and not lead a club from @CKJx 
-- too likely to give up something.

I like the top spade or even the @D10 as the closest thing I've got to a sequence.
Remember South's dbl should deliver something in every suit.
I'm not a fan of low (4th best) leads from bad suits versus trump contracts. |
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


nt||
at|thurston:  Dummy will likely play low and S can win the @DK (this after @D10 lead).
Next, the @SK: 
On that card, N should signal low  (if standard)  =  "Nothing good in spades" 
to get South to switch to the only thing left -- a club.
Eventually the defenders should get 2@S's, 1@H, 1@D and 2@C's, for down 2 instead of making.

thurston:  Defense just needs to get off to a good start and then follow where the carding leads you. |
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


nt||
at|duffer66: You play K from AK in middle of hand? Is there a reason?
thurston:  Yes, always K from AK in the middle  (Starting at trick 2 and beyond)
Especially when you can’t see the Q, to get an attitude signal about that Q from partner.
Thus when you lead the A instead, partner will not expect you to have the K and will signal accordingly. |

pg| ***** 64 ***** |


at|thurston:  Bidding:  5@C is a very good spot - I'd raise to 5@C because I have lots of offense.
duffer66: I raised her cuz I had no defense; but maybe double of 4 spades better?
How does one make those decisions?

thurston:  4@C should not be chopped liver as it's a pretty high level to come in so N's hand is about what I’d expect.  
In short, I'm not sure you'd reach 5@C without the opening and even if you did bid it, 
you might not make it without the opp's bidding. |
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


nt||
at|thurston:  So back to 3@H. 
Even as a transfer preempt... 6 to the Q when vulnerable.... is a bit out there.

I have a regular partner much younger than me and it took me 2 years to cure him of bidding on such trash.  
There were at least 2 results: I'm much happier with his bidding and we won a Canadian Championship.
|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


nt||at|thurston:  I really like transfer preempts - as part of my ^*Uopponents'^*N system.

They give the opps extra options and really don’t serve a lot of useful purposes.
In this hand, if N was void in @S's, she might well bid 6@C and, using the logic I explained, and make it.
Tewksbabe:  Should preempt transfers be on your BBO profile if you play them? |
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


nt||
at|thurston:  The profiles are an arbitrary matter and not really all that useful.
Transfer preempts aren’t common mainly because they aren’t all that effective.  
If you use them you must alert the bid.
When opps bid 3@H, just imagine its really @S's.
The transfer preempt is an opening one below the suit the bidder really has.

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play:  @C's could have been split 1-1 = hard luck ladies.
BUT, can anyone think of how and why declarer might make 5@C?
duffer66: have to take club finesse?

thurston:  But why??
You need W to HAVE one of the missing Kings to avoid 3 losers
and he opened the bidding, vul, at the 3 level without A and K of his own suit. |
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


nt||
at|thurston:  So even the most rabid bidder would have more than a Q high suit for such a 3@H bid so I'd think
he'd have one of the Kings, maybe both by his bid of 3@h.

So ruff the second @S, cross to a @H and take the @C finesse knowing that if it loses to 
E's possible singleton, that the @dK rates to be onside and you’ll still make 5@C |
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


nt||
at|thurston:  It's not about the 1-1 split, it's about W more or less telling you he has one of the key Kings.
So you have 2 chances - the @C finesse first and as a fall back second chance, the diamond finesse.

pg| ***** 86 ***** |


sk||
at|thurston:  Bidding: E's 2@D overcall was just fine even though there were other options: 
a takeout double   or even   2NT to show both minors.
texasbell:  Should I have bid -- I had 8 pts?
thurston:  Yes Texas, there's the rub.
When partner overcalls, it's usually sensible to treat it much the same as an opening bid.
So with 3 trumps, an ace and a singleton, I would always raise 2@D to 3@D|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


nt||at|And if partner makes bad overcalls, that's his lookout!
When you have a known fit, that's a good time to be a bit aggressive. 
If partner has a good hand, you might make a game, and if a bad hand, you might block the opps.
"Raise with Support" is a good mantra.
Most good players when they overcall at the 2 level , will have an opening bid+ with at least a good 5-card suit.

at|thurston:  Bidding:  Excellent auction by   N/S
South raised with support and look what it got them - well played too - 
a bit too odds-against to be in slam even though 12 tricks were there.  
There's always some comfort in bidding when you have found a trump fit. 
If South hadn’t raised  "because the overcall might be weak"  a perfectly good game would have been missed.
I’d rate 5@D making 6@d as about a 70% board in duplicate pairs - 
you don’t always need to be in   "maybe"   slams. |

petskosnet:  Could you bid 2NT instead of 2@D?

Here, South bid voluntarily so you could count on some real values. |

BTW, If South thought he had a great @D raise as a passed hand    (maybe 11-HCP with 4+D) 
he could cuebid    3@S over 2@S

at|thurston:  Bidding: Actually E/W have a great 4-4 @H fit that plays a whole lot easier than 4@S.
I've never been a big fan of raising Pard's 1-level Major suit response with only 3 trumps.
Here W might rebid 2@H to show 4 cards and since it's a reverse, at least 16 HCP.
This time E will raise and we'll play 4@H, that will make by setting up @S's.
So both games might actually make this time.
But imagine E had replied 1@S on @SQxxx - would you really like him to be in 4@s? |
pg| ***** 124 ***** |


nt||
at|thurston:  For me, all direct raises of 1-over-1 responses are 4 cards

Imagine E with  @sQJxx  @hxx  @dQx  @cKjxxx    for 1@S, 
then we'd belong in 3NT and get there after a 2@H rebid.

up|36|pf|y|at|thurston:  Play: There's a saying that half of money players go broke not drawing trumps soon enough 
and the other half go broke drawing trumps too soon.
Here, E has @C losers in hand but shortness in dummy, so win a high @H in dummy 
(saving the A for an entry) and give up a @C.  
Then you can use a @H entry and a @D ruff to trump both @C losers in dummy BEFORE DRAWING trumps.

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|lb|*yShould south bid 2@C?^^n|mb|2C|at|thurston: South has a 1NT response, as the hand is 10 hcp

(MM: 1NT forcing, planning to support partner later in hearts..the hand is worth a limit raise....)

sk||
at|thurston:  In the bidding, 2@S was a "reverse" again = more @H than @S    and 16+ HCP 
so South can’t pass below game as 16 + 10 = enough.

MrsD12345: Why did N bid @S twice ?  And why did South seem so unenthusiastic ?
LadyStar17:  I supported hearts at the three level...  I expected partner to bid 4 hearts not 3 spades. |
pg| ***** 142 ***** |


nt||
at|thurston:  Excellent question
MarilynLi: I thought we were playing 2/1 and 3@S meant for slam try.

thurston:  The first S bid showed strength and at least a 4-card length.
Once @H were agreed as trumps and, because of the combined strength, the auction was game forcing, 
then N was worth trying for slam-- to make 3@S a cuebid saying 
"I have the ace here and am interested in slam, what do you think?" |
pg| ***** 143 ***** |


nt||
at|thurston:  With a rock bottom minimum, S would sign off in game.
LadyStar17:  1@H - 2@C game force.
thurston:  If you play 2/1: 1@H - 2@C is a GF, this South hand is way too weak by my standards for a 2/1 response.
Yes, you'll likely get to game but showing a GF with 10 HCP might get partner too excited.
Playing 2/1, this is a 1NT forcing response, not 2@C.
LadyStar17:  As dummy I added points for single spade. |
pg| ***** 144 ***** |


nt||
at|thurston:  But the @S shortness may not be useful.  
1@H - 1NT - 2@S - 4@H    is how we'd bid in 2/1.
Opener would then know slam was very doubtful as we simply couldn’t have enough A's and K's and tricks.

at|thurston:  Misfits are always painful – N/S have no good fit and the breaks are bad
With North's hand, 2@S is Ok    but due to run into a horrible break if left there.
Well. E might have opened a weak 2@S   (I would)

That would get a bid from S for sure and N/S would still get overboard -- 11 HCP.
anniebmisc:  Paul, do you count Bergen starting points?
thurston:  No, for starting the bidding I count HCP only
