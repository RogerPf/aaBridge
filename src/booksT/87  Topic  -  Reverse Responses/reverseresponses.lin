^-|ht|c|cs||fp||cp||AT|^B@2^*BMM:^*N Howard Schutzman, BBO nickname, (hondo717) sat with the Movie Maker answering to, "How Should You Respond to Opener's Reverse Bid?" The following is a summary from that meeting. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is the area where many partnerships, even experienced ones, have the most difficulty. Here is the basic problem. In most auctions, one person takes charge (most often the responder), and drives the partnership to the appropriate contract. However, with reverse auctions, there is a lot of ambiguity regarding whether or not the partnership should be in game, and who is in charge. If the responder has 9+ points, then he or she needs to take charge to make sure the partnership gets to game. If the opener has a very good hand (18+), then he or she needs to take charge and make sure game is bid. However, when neither partner has game forcing values, or both partners have game forcing values, the auction can get confusing. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is no universal agreement on how to handle this problem. I am going to present the method I use, which I find both simple and effective. First of all, what are responder's obligations when opener makes a reverse bid? The simplest way to play is that it is a one round force for responder. Responder must make one more bid. Some people also play that the auction cannot stop below 2NT. That is a reasonable way to play, as it gives more flexibility in some auctions, but is not crucial.|

^-|at|^-With game forcing values (9 or more points)
^-|ht|d|fp||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With game forcing values, the key thing to remember is that if, as responder you have a game forcing hand, you must make a bid that communicates that to opener. The only non-game bid that is forcing is the 4th suit. If you make any other non-game bid, opener can pass. Therefore, with game forcing values (9 or more points) I recommend:|

PG| ***** 10 ***** |


  
 
HT|x|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|While it is true that, occasionally, bidding the 4th suit makes the auction difficult (particularly if is a major at the 3-level), my experience is that this approach is simple, unambiguous, and works very well on most hands. It pretty much always gets you to a reasonable contract.|

PG| ***** 13 ***** |


ht|l|at|^B@2All non-game bids by opener show a game forcing hand. The main use of this principle is to allow opener to show delayed support for responder's major, giving the partnership a choice of 4 of the major, 3NT, or returning to opener's suit. For example in the auction below,|
ht|o|cs|6|at|^b{|ia|,1CP1SP2HP3CP3S|at|}|ht|n|at|^m@2^Y@3^*B3@S^*N is forcing.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


ht|u|cs|6|at|^b{|ia|,1DP1SP2HP2SP3D|at|}|ht|t|at|^m@2^Y@3If responder has rebid his suit, opener often passes, makes an invitational raise, or bids game. The only non-game bid that establishes a game force is the 4th suit. All other non-game bids are usually passed by responder. So, for example, the auction on the left is to play.|

If responder bids 2NT, the only non-forcing bid is a correction to 3 of opener's first suit. All other bids establish a game force.|

As a general rule, if, as responder, you are not sure whether the third bid by opener is forcing or not, assume it is forcing. |

ht|v|cs|6|at|^b{|ia|,1CP1SP2HP3CP3S|at|}|ht|v|at|^m@2^Y@3Watch out for the auction on the left which comes up frequently. It is when opener makes a delayed preference to responder's suit. That is forcing. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Larry is a great bridge player and a great bridge teacher. Read his nice article on the subject from |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.larryco.com/BridgeArticles/ArticleDetails.aspx?articleID=22^*N|CP||AT|

Also for completion of this subject yon need to look at a great article by Neil H. Timm |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/2jdndx^*N|CP||AT|
He describes Ingberman Convention which many use to respond to opener's reverse.
