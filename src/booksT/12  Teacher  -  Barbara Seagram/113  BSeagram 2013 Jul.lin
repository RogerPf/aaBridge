A round of applause for Maureen who created this site and does so much for beginners and intermediates. We are so lucky to have her.   If you are not a member of BIL, DO consider joining
When I use CAPS everyone, it is only to emphasize. Many in cyberspace deem that to be shouting. I am NOT shouting!!!

Note that mceg did not ask for aces.
She has 18 HCP and knows that if partner only has 15 HCP, they still have 33 HCP between the two hands and thus, only missing 7 HCP, they cannot be missing 2 aces|

Please make your Declarer plan before continuing to the actual play
During the actual play try to spot "what went wrong, where and why"
Once the board is played and Barbara gave her comments, the hand will be reloaded and "played" again the correct way 
(with all 4 hands open this time)
After that, you can give it another try yourself "Double Dummy" if you wish
(playing the hand yourself by clicking on the cards)|

nt||sk|s|lb|*cWhat would be your Opening Lead?^^ht^4SJ43HT98532ct5D73|
pc|HT|at|bseagram:  Now...first of all the opening lead:
Best to lead the 10 when you have a sequence
Only lead 4th best when you do NOT have a sequence and you ought to also have at least a J|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt||sk||at|bseagram:  Declare's job is now to count winners
Winners are SURE tricks that will win WITHOUT losing the lead
Guaranteed tricks
Fast tricks
NO ACE, NO winner!
e.g. If you have KQJ10 in a suit, you have ZERO winners|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram:  This will enable you to figure out how many FAST tricks you have
And then when you come up short (you always will be short of winners) then you will have to figure out what your project suit is
Marilu, you were tempted to consider diamonds as your project suit because they were prettier. BUT
Here is the problem with the diamonds|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram:  You only have SEVEN diamonds between you and partner|hc|dk962AQ5|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


lc|dk962AQ5|at|
BUT you have EIGHT clubs|hc|cak287643|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


at|
When you have 7 cards between you and partner. Missing 6 (an even number) MOST of the time they will divide BADLY
Missing an ODD number, they will divide favourably|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


lc|cak287643|nt||at|
Thus we should expect diamonds (missing 6 of them) to divide 4-2.
BUT clubs we have 8...missing 5, they will divide 3-2 more often
(an odd number missing tends to split more evenly)
Thus, clubs should be your project suit|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


at|
When do we attack our project suit?????????
Always immediately if not sooner|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram:  We count losers in SUIT contracts and winners in NT contracts
So clubs is the project suit
You see, I believe that NT's are easier contracts than suit contracts because in suit contracts we also have a project suit but we have one additional decision to make at start of hand
That is: DO I PULL TRUMP FIRST OR NOT???
In No Trump, that decision is removed.    So project suit first|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram:  Supposing we play clubs and find out really bad news...
e.g. Someone fails to follow to second round of clubs
Well THEN we will fall back on diamonds and pray (always remember to pray and cross your fingers) that diamonds divide 3-3|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt||at|note movie maker: 
The indicated play will follow now
At the end, I will reload again, so you can play the hand "Double Dummy" if you wish
But please don't skip to the next hand yet, as more notes follow at the end of this one

up|52|pf|y|at|bseagram:  Excellent
But a word of advice when you are playing your project suit
Finish playing the clubs while you REMEMBER that those hopeless little spot cards are high cuz they sure look pathetic
You can give away a club early or play Ace then King Clubs and then give one away to charity|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt||at|123600:  Prefer safety play first
x_ruff: If give away a club early run the risk of finding they are not 3-2. So should play them from top?
bseagram:  In 6NT sometimes it feels safer to safety play and duck one early|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt||at|sallykay: Why wouldn't north return @H rather than lead into @D tenace?
bseagram:  Holden should definitely have led back a @H
When dummy is on your right, lead to weakest suit in sight. It is wrong to lead into dummy's Diamond tenace for sure|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt||at|brmac: Is there any point in bidding for W to ask for Aces?
bseagram:  No point asking for aces. They have 33 HCP between them so cannot be missing two aces. That would be worth 8 HCP
Once every 12 years opening leader will have Ace and King in same suit
sallykay: Having 18 I see the 6NT...what number would you use for Quantitative 4NT?
bseagram:  16 or a bad 17 HCP = 4NT
(that leaves 16-17, because when you hold 15 and partner is maximum with 17, that is still only 32 max)|

nt||at|bseagram:  OK, now let's see what went wrong
Let us all count winners in NS hands together|
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


at|
3 spades
3 hearts (looks like 4 but they die under each other so there are only 3 @h winners
ZERO club winers
2 diamond winners       |
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram:  Total equals only 8 winners
We need 9 to make 3NT
So we have to get one more trick
Here's the biggest tip of all
When you cannot work out what your project suit is, work out what it isnt|
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram:  Can you get more than three spade tricks?|
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


at| 
No      Can you get more than 3 heart tricks?|
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


at|
No      Can you get more than 2 diamonds tricks (NOT when opponents have 7 cards in this suit and you only have 6)
Thus you have to pick the leftover suit even though it looks super pathetic
Clubs is your project|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram:  When will we play clubs???|
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


at|
Holden47:  immediately, whilst we still have stops in other suits
bseagram:  YEAH!!!!
Okay. Now NS has their project suit which is clubs
EW has their project suit which is spades.
NS and EW must always be leading different suits
Confucius say....Both sides lead same suit, somebody crazy|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram:  OK, let's do a replay now
I want you to be like a pit bull with a bone
Have a ONE track mind. Margo D
CLUBs and clubs forever....  Even though they look gruesome
You also MUST count your project suit|
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


nt||at|Gerram:  how does west know @S is their project suit?
bseagram:  W had a choice of what to lead
Stayman not used so better to lead a major than a minor|

7 winners in total => we need 2 more
Which suit looks like it can easily provide 2 more winners?|
pg| ***** 128 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram:  Answer? Clubs
Here is the catch
When something looks this easy, you have to stop and think....what could possibly go wrong?
The darn club suit blocks, that is the problem. 
Burloak correctly played clubs first and set up the 5 Clubs in hand BUT then there were no longer any entries to the west hand.....Shame|
pg| ***** 129 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram:  So what card specifically in Club suit (on first round of clubs) should we get rid of from dummy, Burloak?
Let's move on to that point....|
