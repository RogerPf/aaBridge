^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
He’s been mentoring in BIL for 2 years and lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

He learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |

^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

mitche: Hi, everyone and welcome to tonight's 2 over 1 play and discuss session.
2 over 1 means: 
If your partner opens in first or second seat and you bid a non-jump 2 level bid, it is game-forcing.
Also if pard opens 1@H or 1@s in first/second seat, your response of 1NT (with no intervening bid) 
is forcing for 1 round .  Otherwise, the bidding looks a lot like SA|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||at|92612:  Mitch, do you use reverse Bergen with 2/1? 
And do you use drury?
mitche: I prefer regular Bergen, not reverse. 
Because you need the game invite more over the weaker response
Yes, 2-way reverse, but any Drury agreement is useful

If you were to do that here, it would create problems - 
but check with your partner to make sure you and she are on the same page.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: East's opening 1@C is pretty standard, but a lot of people would open this hand 1NT, 
with 17 HCP and semi-balanced hand
If you ^*udo^*n open 1NT, make sure you and pard agree on this style
The reason for 1NT is you do not need to stretch to bid 2@S in this particular auction...

at|
What did north discard on trick 3?|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: the @D4.
Could that be interpreted as a suit-preference signal or a count signal?
Should S say to herself, "hmm - @D4 . Is my pard asking me to shift to clubs?"|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt||at|
Not if she remembers the bidding! 
East advertised clubs with his 1@C opening, so S should probably  guess this card is a count card
So I am left to wonder -- what was N saying with that card?
naudetpat:  My first discard...low says I don’t want a @D lead....Should I give count?
mitche: I would interpret the @D4 as a "pick what you think is best" card. 
If you want to discourage, play your ^*Blowest^*N diamond, the 3!!! |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: That is really the point! 
An astute pard will notice the 3 is absent, and place it in declarer’s hand
If I were in N's seat, I would have played the @D7 and hope pard would read it as encouraging. 
The missing @D8 might be in declarer’s hand, so the 9 is too good a card to use as a signal|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Later on in play (and this is important - ) S had to find a discard on a trump.
She discarded a club.(trick 6)
Better is to ditch a heart. 
Declarer bid clubs, and it is a rule of defense to hang onto the suit your RHO is known to have
Reason - discarding from that suit makes it easier for RHO to set up the suit

up|38|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: One of the rules you learn early on is "4th from longest and strongest"
Here is the problem. 
West has 11 HCP and South has around 21, plus or minus 1
That leaves only 8 points between dummy and pard. 
Dummy passed, so pard probably has at least 5 of the missing points.|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: With me so far?
Good. With declarer having 21 and pard 5, who is more likely to have the @SQ?|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


at|
declarer... 
So leading from Kxxx (in either @S or @D is likely to cost the defense a trick)|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Therefore, I need to guess whether to lead a heart or a club
I am going to guess to lead a heart.
Why? |
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


at|
It may blow 1 trick, but it establishes one for my side. 
Also, pard is more likely to hold the @HJ than either the queen of diamonds or spades|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: In other words, it both attacks and is reasonably safe
Leading either spades or diamonds will allow S to make the contract easily. 
lorena22:  Do you lead king of hearts?
mitche: yes
It turns out that leading a club is safe on this deal, but it figures to be a loser in more cases;  
It may finesse pard's only useful card.|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


nt||at|irinica: why is E more likely to hold the @hJ?
mitche: she is more likely to have that card than either queen of spades or diamonds
Again, counting points, East has 5 or so and it's likelier to find a jack than a queen in her hand

at|mitche: Bidding: I guess E thought to show her hand's strength with 2NT
But that bid is incorrect for a number of reasons:
First, East has a 4-card major, and it is incumbent on you to show a major when you can
If East responds 1@S, then I think they get to 4@S instead of 3NT, and that is a better contract with these cards|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: second, in standard bidding - responder's 1NT response to 1@C usually shows 6 - 9 HCP and at least  one honor in both majors 
The 2NT response shows 10-11 HCP and also denies a 4 card major (so did 1NT)
And finally, a 3NT response shows a hand with 13-15 HCP 
That is standard American; some people make other agreements, but without a special understanding,  I would expect pard to understand that to be the structure of NT responses to 1@C|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: West's response to 2@h was probably intended to show concentrated strength. 
I think it works better to use a suit bid over a NT response to show an unbalanced hand, 
one not suited  to be dummy at a notrump contract
For example with 1426 shape, I rebid 3@H because I expect the other guys will be able to attack spades successfully|
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


nt||at|kat827:  Does what you said above, for standard bidding of 1NT, apply only after 1@C 
(that you need at least 1 honor in both majors)?|

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: When South led her small heart, N should be happy. 
With Jxxx, she wants S to keep on leading hearts.
So unless you use non-standard upside-down signals 
(I recommend you don't unless you are in an established partnership), 
she should play the highest card she can spare, the @H9
That says, "Pard, I love your opening lead"|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Of course, sometimes the 9 will be from shortness, 
but after the 2NT bid denies a @H suit, the 9 means - continue the suit, please|
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


at|
One point on declarer's play. She finessed in clubs and the @CJ won a trick
So she should lead a spade to dummy and repeat the finesse.
That gives her 3 hearts, 3 spades, and 3 clubs, and it allows her to make the contract

nt||at|mitche: OK. then let me thank the first round of players and ask them to sit out for the next group. Are you all ready to jump in, or do I need to put something tasty on the table?

up|32|pf|y|at|mitche: Opening lead: when nature arranges for you to have a suit headed by the AK, it usually (but not always :) ) is a good idea to lead the ace
So my choice would have been the @DA
That turns out to hold EW to 11 tricks.|
pg| ***** 113 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: In play, E probably forgot that the @SJ made his appearance on trick 1, so the 10 was a winner. 
As you play more, you will acquire the skill of remembering what has been played
I recommend that you ALWAYS try to count out the hand as it's been played. 
That is probably the hardest thing for you to master - counting.|

I think the best defense here is to play a trump at trick 2, rather than to release the @DA
When N plays the DA at trick 2, the hand can be made.
Declarer wins trick 3 and plays 3 rounds of trumps, ending with the @CK in dummy
The Diamond suit now runs, and declarer discards all 4 of his baby spades

sk||at|mitche: Bidding: I guess that 2@h is going to be a popular choice of opening bids
And 3@C is also going to be a popular overcall
East did well not to bid 3@D, since that bid will almost always get EW into hot water
And so 3@c is the final contract.

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: I think that the best opening lead is the @H6. 
Here is what happens on a heart lead: 
Ace, ruff, spade to ace, ruff, @DA and a certain set|
pg| ***** 165 ***** |


at|
After the first 2 tricks, I think declarer can get home- club ace, spade ruff, club king, club  A spade from East sets up the @S10 for a discard, And declarer can lead a diamond to the king to finesse against the @HQ, Defense gets 1 spade, the @DA, a heart, and a trump|
pg| ***** 166 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So the moral of the story is when pard opens with a weak 2, if you are on opening lead, give very strong consideration to leading that suit, even if you have a strong one of your own!|
pg| ***** 167 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: OK - we started a bit late, so if you all want to do another 2 deals, I would thank the players and ask them to allow the third group to sit in
I don't have a lesson planned for this evening. 
By the way, is there a full moon tonight?
BILAsst10: think so:)
mitche: AHA!! THAT explains the weird hands tonite!!!|
pg| ***** 168 ***** |


nt||at|dragonfly:  No 2/1 boards?
mitche: I think the number of 2 over 1 responses is about 15-20 % in actual play
Other than those deals, forcing 1NT is the only other 2 over 1 gadget, really
All in all, I think about 55-65% of SA and 2/1 auctions would be very nearly identical

sk||at|mitche: Bidding: I must say, you guys are pretty conservative bidders!!
I would have started the W hand with a 4@S bid. 
You have a rock-solid spade suit and not much else.   The bid may or may not make, but it will most certainly put the auction to a  quick and peaceful end.
And you are at most down 1 as the cards are distributed|
pg| ***** 179 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: I don't know if it's the right bid, but with no defense outside of clubs, the N hand may very well consider a 3@C preemptive overcall. 
There is an argument for 2@C followed by 3@C, as the @CAK do have some potential defensive value
In any case, after 2@C, East’s 2@S bid looks correct 
She has 3 card support and a ruffing value and 7-10 HCP. So she and I both bid 2@s|
pg| ***** 180 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: South has a very good hand after the 2@C overcall. I would consider bidding 3@S to show at least a limit raise and 4 card support
How many of you know "cue bid = limit raise +" ?? 
BILAsst10: yes - but doesn't have to be 4 cards - unless you are a Lawrence disciple - I bid it with 3+ card support.|
pg| ***** 181 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Some people use the cue bid by "advancer" to ask for a stopper. That is also OK
(note mm: some/many will use it as stopper ask if it can nOT be a limit raise)
Eileen's point about being a Lawrence disciple - Mike Lawrence likes to use the cue bid to show 4-card support|
pg| ***** 182 ***** |


nt||at|aflac:  who is the advancer in this example?
mitche: the opening bidder's RHO is "advancer".
masse24: hmmmm :) and I always thought "advancer" was the partner of the overcaller
->masse24: Isn't that the same thing?
masse24: No, here it was.....but....no. The advancer is always the partner of the overcaller|
pg| ***** 183 ***** |


nt||at|irinica:  Is this the western cuebid?
mitche: yes, it is western cue bid (actually, when I was living in Berkeley, we called it an "eastern" cue bid)
BILAsst10: :)   wondered what the difference was
mitche: the point of the cue is to show something specific about your hand. 
The idea was that if you have a full stopper, you could bid NT anyway. It was the partial stopper that was impossible to find
irinica:  so you use the western cuebid when you have half stopper?|

up|28|pf|y|at|mitche: My first expert partner was a guy named Joe Houde, and he used that to become one of the youngest  LM's ever back in the 1960's
Yes, I am that old :)
But before a stroll down memory lane, I want to make one point on defense
When W won the @SA, he decided to shift to a heart. He was hoping to find his partner with the @HA|
pg| ***** 194 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: If declarer has the ace, he might very well decide to play low on the @H8 lead.
So, unless W was hoping to trick declarer into thinking the 8 was singleton 
(and that would be an OK defense, too), you may as well just play the @HK|
pg| ***** 195 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: OK - it is 11:00 here on the east coast, where we play Western cue bids to ask for full stoppers.
Thank you all for playing, and thank Eileen for her generous support and assistance
Have a pleasant week, and happy Sequester this Friday.. BAH!!!|
