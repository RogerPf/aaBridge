^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||at|


^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

mitche: Hi, everyone and welcome to tonight's 2 over 1 play and discuss session.
2 over 1 means: 
If your partner opens in first or second seat and you bid a non-jump 2 level bid, it is game-forcing.
Also if pard opens 1@H or 1@s in first/second seat, your response of 1NT (with no intervening bid) 
is forcing for 1 round .  Otherwise, the bidding looks a lot like SA|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||at|92612:  Mitch, do you use reverse Bergen with 2/1? 
And do you use Drury?
mitche: I prefer regular Bergen, not reverse. 
Because you need the game invite more over the weaker response
Yes, 2-way reverse, but any Drury agreement is useful

sk||pc|c4|at|mitche: Bidding: It is a question of style whether N opens 2@S or passes. 
There are advantages and disadvantages either way
My preference is to have a better suit, but some people - notably Marty Bergen - 
believe this is a perfectly good weak 2
So you need to discuss with your partner whether you use sound preempts 
(i.e. a suit headed by QJ10 or better) or not|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: In any case, S opened 1@D and W doubled, 
both very sound bids.
1@D is standard. All opening bids in 2 over 1 are essentially identical to SA
All right, After a takeout double, North's 1@S is forcing for 1 round, which seems reasonable.
What should East do over 1@S?|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


at|
pass, of course! She has no points and no shape!
Even THINKING about bidding with that hand in this situation is an overbid|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt||at|South rebid 2@H, which I think is not best. 
First off, with no fit for spades, and opener's LHO promising hearts, the best bid for S is 2@D
BILAsst10: isn’t 2@H a reverse showing a stronger hand?
mitche: I think 2@D shows either 6 or a very good 5 card suit - and that is what S has
Yes, 2@H is a reverse. The strength and shape are OK for it, but the bidding has made S hand less valuable. 
The @CQ is of doubtful value and the hearts were "bid" on her left.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So S should (IMO) go slowly here with 2@D
BILAsst10: if strong enough to reverse why not 3@D?
mitche: I think 3@D rebid by S is not completely unreasonable, but remember - 
1@S bid by N limited that hand to about 8 or 9 points. 
And N would bid 1@S with 5 spades and 6 points .. so 3@D might work
But I don't like to bid that way with a possible misfit|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: (my old Roth-Stone backround is showing... )
And the @CQ is still worth less than we think
OK .. so 2@D is my choice
Oh, yeah, the form of scoring might matter whether to bid 2 or 3 @D
At matchpoints, 2 is OK, and at IMPS, where there is a large bonus for bidding games, 3@D would work better.. 
Or even 2@H (looking for 3NT)|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt||at|
In any case, 3@D became the final contract.. 
Roth-Stone is a vintage 1960 bidding system, based on very sound opening bids with very aggressive bids by responder...

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: OK - on to Play: It seems to me that even with clubs being the unbid suit, 
leading from KJxx is risky.
The bidding revealed that S has hearts, and so does West. 
In order for her to protect her potential heart winners, W should lead a trump|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt||at|Guide - if you have RHO's side suit under control, 
and especially if your other leads are unappealing, 
lead a trump to cut down dummy's ruffing power|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt||at|On the club lead, S should play as follows: 
at trick 2, lead a spade. West's double pretty much puts the @SAce in her hand,
If West wins the @SA, then Liza can pitch a losing @H on the @SK
And if not, then the spade loser has vanished..|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


nt||at| 
Either way W defends, it costs her a trick
After the spade play, if W leads a trump, Liza could win, play  @HA, 
heart ruff, spade king, discarding a losing heart, and then she makes 5, 
losing spade and trump

pc|h6|at|mitche: Bidding: I think all bids were pretty normal.
But W might have bid 3@D instead of 3NT, which would have gotten E/W to 4@S
Someone asked about the 2@D overcall.
The weak jump overcall, with a strong diamond suit and nothing else is pretty common bidding
Note that even if N is broke, S can expect to take at least 6 tricks. 
And if N is really broke, then E/W probably have game, possibly a slam|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Now, on to the 3@D bid West might have made. 
It invites E to bid something clever - 
like 3@S with spade support, 3@H with heart cards but no 3-card spade support
or 3NT with a diamond card
This kind of cue bid is a very nice trick to have up your sleeve...|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Remember it...the bid asks for your pard to show support; or lacking support, to bid a stopper.
realrowdy:  Is that western cue? 
mitche: Well, Liza, not quite. 
Since E could have support for West's spades, it's more of what Rodwell-Meckstroth call a "thrump" double, 
offering a choice of games
It's sort of a "card - showing" cue bid|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Someone asked if E should bid 3@S instead of 3@C
It's possible that west has just 4 spades for her 2@S bid, so 3@C might be best
What would you want west to bid with KQxx, Ax, xxxx, Jx?   no heart support.. double is negative..
jonnyquest: Double, showing one (or both) Majors
mitche: No, if opener bids a minor and it's overcalled with the other minor, 
then X promises support for both majors!
This is pretty standard stuff. I think that the majority of players treat the negative X that way|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt||at|
In any case, E/W missed 4@S and wound up in 3NT
BILAsst10: can E cue @D to show 3 @S's ?
mitche: East's 3@D bid would ask for a diamond stop, I think, because he is sitting in front of the @D bidder... 
Or as Liza asked, a "western cue"

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Now - play of 3NT....
The opening lead was the small heart. 
a) I would have preferred leading the diamond. 
Anyway -- the opening lead was a heart, won in dummy. 
I think it best to duck the first heart, or if declarer wants to win it, she should win it in her hand
Then she can take a finesse in either spades or clubs|
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


nt||at|As it is, N should have won the @SK and continued the heart attack to set up that suit
Here is how the play may have gone: 
at trick 1 - West wins the @HA and plays the @CJ
When it wins, she leads another club AND REPEATS THE FINESSE
This assures 6 clubs. Then she can knock out the spade king to take at least 11 tricks

pc|hk|at|mitche: Bidding: I think that East's double was the best choice of bids - 
She has the strength to bid 1NT, but with 4 cards in hearts, the other major, double looks much better
Remember that when you overcall 1NT, not only do you promise a stop in the suit bid on your right, but you tend to deny having a takeout double type shape.
What should S do after the double?|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


nt||at|Note that most pairs play that after a double, a 1-level bid is forcing for 1 round, and a 2-level bid is weak
So S has a pretty good hand and should not make a weak bid
2@C could have been passed...
Lola8888:  So then should she redouble?
mitche: If you play that 2NT shows at least a limit raise with 4 spades, then S has to redouble, saying "10 or more HCP"|
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


nt||at|realrowdy:  I thought new suit required 1 bid
mitche: Not over the double...
I think that if redouble denies support, then S must bid 2NT (the Jordan convention) 
So I would rewind (redouble) on S hand.. the redouble says, "the hand is ours, and we will either bid to game or double any contract they arrive at" 
which is why most people play that the redouble shows at most 2 card support for opener's major|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


nt||at|btour:  Don’t most play J2NT off in competition?
mitche: Jacoby 2NT is off in comp, yes, but 1@S (x) 2NT is the JORDAN convention, showing a limit raise or more 
Again, check with pard whether or not you redouble with 10 points and 3 card support.. 
That is the usual understanding -- then you need to redouble and support spades
So to summarize: if the redouble can be made with 3 cards in support of opener’s major, Liza's hand must redouble
If the redouble denies support (some people play that way), then she jumps to 2NT|
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


nt||at|The conventional way to play it is to redouble....
And this leads to West's problem.
Over 2@C, she bid 2@H
I think I might bid 4@H with her hand. 
If East promises good 3 card support (or 4 card support), then E/W have at least 10 hearts and should make it hard for N/S to get to 4@S|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


nt||at|btour:  does 4 hearts make and 4@s make?
mitche: 4@H is either to make (a good hand with 5 hearts) or a terrible one with very long hearts, 
an "advance sacrifice" if you know the term
Note that if N/S decide to defend, E/W may wind up going down just 1, a pretty fair save against 4@S

pc|hj|at|mitche: Bidding: What does responder need to bid 1@S over 1@C?
Let's say a good 5 points, but 6 is a reasonable minimum. Why do I ask?
If 1@S promises 6 points, then opener needs 19-20 dummy points for bidding 4@S
Right? You need 25 or 26 points in the combined hands to bid to game, right?
So 6+19 = 25.. Responder's got the 6 ... opener needs the 19
And (of course!) a good fit for spades.. But that is part of the 19-20 dummy points for spades|
pg| ***** 107 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Does N have that good a hand? Yes!
The 5th spade, the void, the solid 6 card club suit.. 
If S has as little as K10xx in spades, game is sure -  well almost sure 
(a very foul trump division and a bad guess might beat 4@S)
Now .... back to S hand.|
pg| ***** 108 ***** |


nt||at|If N says "20 points in support of spades", S has 15 points and that means the hand is in the slam zone
Yes, an opening 1@C could be as strong as 21 points, but not knowing about your spades, 
N has a sound minimum 1@C opener
When S bids spades, N's hand improves. Lots, 
You all realize that N's hand is a lot better than 11 points once S bids spades|
pg| ***** 109 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Bergen would give N 5 points for the void, another 1 for the doubleton, another 1 for the 6th club, another for the 5th spade, and yet another 1 for the "quality" club suit
I would just bid 6 spades with the S hand and be done with it. 
I cannot imagine a hand where there's no play for slam once the 4@S bid was made
My point: the jump to 4 is NOT (repeat, NOT!!!) a "shutout bid". S is free to bid more with a good hand|
pg| ***** 110 ***** |


nt||at|jonnyquest: 4@D Splinter a better rebid? May as well show it along the way...
mitche: You need to recognize the difference between 1@S – 4@S (weak bid by responder) 
and 1@C – 1@S/ 4@S by opener (very strong bid)
I don't mind the splinter, except the hand is almost too good for it!
If N did bid 4@D, then S should bid 4@H to show the @HA... 
Actually, now that I look at S's hand, if pard jumped to 4@S, I might bid 5@D myself, looking for a grand... 
either that or 4NT...

sk|n|mb|3hppp|sk||pc|dk|at|mitche: Bidding: This is the reason Lebensohl was invented...
First: whatever 2@D means (majors, diamonds, diamond plus a major). what does the double mean?
tutootsie: I thot stolen bid
mitche: I play and recommend that you learn the Lebensohl convention. 
My preference is to file stolen bids in the circular file (the trash can ... ) because of hands like this
OK .. so N/S both took the hand as "stolen bid", and S bids 2@H|
pg| ***** 127 ***** |


nt||at|Now, N has a different problem .. with 8 points and a void... what should she do? 
3@D is going to be hard to figure out, and any number of hearts is just plain wrong. 
2NT invitational? Not with a void!!!
So the hand has become impossible for N/S to bid and know what they're doing... 
That is why stolen bids suck, pardon me|
pg| ***** 128 ***** |


nt||at|peggyall:  If playing lebensohl, should N just make a penalty X and give up on game?
mitche: so N/S stopped in 3@H 
(BTW, if I am N, and I had to double as stolen bid, I would bid 3@D and hope we survive) 
Pard might bid 3NT, which is also a horrible contract

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: But we are in 3@H on a diamond lead, covered and ruffed. 
East returned a club to try to get pard in for more diamond plays
S must win the @CA and play the @SA and K to discard clubs. 
Then she should ruff a club, ruff a diamond, ruff another club (or spade)
This allows her to make the @CA, the @SAK, the @HAK, and 2 more ruffs to get out for down 2|

sk|e|lb|*bPlease choose your bid.^^p|mb|4hppp|
pg| ***** 151 ***** |


sk||pc|da|at|mitche: Bidding: : Let's start with 3@C
That bid promises about 10 points and it should say, "I do not have support for hearts"
Why?
When the opponents overcall, you would love to find your trump fit as soon as possible
So W doesn't have as many as 3 hearts. 
If she does, then she will bid hearts later, showing a very good hand|
pg| ***** 152 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So when N raises to 4 diamonds (preemptively), East should just pass. 
Why? 
a) the hearts are not all that great. KQ987x will not play for 1 loser opposite a singleton small heart
And bidding 4@H all by yourself (as East did) shows a pretty solid suit, something like KQJ10xx 
b) if East passes, then west can add her ideas to the discussion 
And West's idea will be either to pass or to bid 5@C (I'd pass).|
pg| ***** 153 ***** |


nt||at|Redbird44:  I would have considered X of 4@D 
mitche: doubling 4@D is not a good idea, as it happens. 
Defenders get 1 spade, 1 heart, and 0 or 1 diamond, if declarer guesses well
So this leads to the idea of the week: 
In competition, unless you're sure of what's right, give partner a chance to vote!|
pg| ***** 154 ***** |


nt||at|
Redbird44:  I would have counted on my pard’s defensive tricks and I would have X
mitche: Well, E has 2 defensive tricks, but alas, one of them disappears because of the void
And the rule of thumb: double without a trump trick is very, very risky
(In fact, Mike Lawrence, in one of his books on competitive bidding said, "doubling without a trump trick is forbidden")|
pg| ***** 155 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Also, E has 4 card spade suit, 
so she isn't sure that spades wouldn’t be a good trump suit
BILAsst10: should E even open that hand or wait and see
mitche: Well, if you count points, you have 11 HCP and 10 cards in 2 suits and 2 quick tricks, so you have a bergen 20 - plus
There is a lot of advantage to getting the first bid in, so I would open 1@H in first seat, even vul 
With wild distribution, and an 8-card suit is wild distribution, you really don't know what's working.|
pg| ***** 156 ***** |


nt||at|Your hand might bid 5@C over 4@D because an 8-bagger is usually best on offense
And you do not have a trump trick, and partner's very short in diamonds (they bid and jump-raised diamonds)
Note - extreme distribution makes high cards in short suits less valuable... 
I cannot overemphasize the point that having an 8-card suit makes you want to be declarer.
If your pard had 8 hearts, she may well have opened 4@H with a weaker hand. 
Her 4@H bid should have shown a better suit (we discussed that before), so you can't be sure. |
pg| ***** 157 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: But modern bidding style is to push with 7- or 8 card long suits
Redbird44:  so take your p out of the 4@H contract with this hand?
mitche: E/W lose one club, one diamond, and 1 spade always.  
You cannot get to dummy often enough to establish hearts and discard a loser. 
They will assuredly pull trumps for you|
pg| ***** 158 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Finding a trump switch at trick 2 is pretty easy defense... 
mitche: In the 0 to 300 game, you might find some defenders who do not shift to trumps, but not very many of them, I promise you...and if you play money bridge ... 
BILAsst10: esp with E as dummy - switch looks easy
mitche: and possibly a second @D trick on good defense|

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: OK .. let me thank you all for a lively discussion and Eileen for her generous assistance.
I recommend that you all head to your local bookseller or Amazon, whichever's closer, and get Kantar's book on introductory declarer play. It's really good.
