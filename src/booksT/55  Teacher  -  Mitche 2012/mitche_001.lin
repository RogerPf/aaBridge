^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
He’s been mentoring in BIL for 2 years and lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

He learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|

^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play.

mitche: Brief introduction to 2 over 1 for SA players: if you have not passed, and partner opens the bidding at the 1-level  
(1@d or 1 of a major) and you make a non-jump bid at the 2-level in a new suit, that establishes a game force
So in SA, 1@H - 2@C the 2@c bid says "10+ HCP". In 2 over 1, you are not alowed to stop below game. 
So you have about a minimum of a very good 12 HCP
To handle the problem of staying at the 1 level, if pard opens 1@H or 1@S, you may bid 1NT as a one-round force
OK? Let's go!|

mitche: Next, we look at 2@s. I think I would have bid 3@S with the West hand. 
Why? I think that the hand would OPEN the bidding 3@s. Yes?
acl_uy:  y
mitche: Also, West can reason "my pard passed 1@h". Therefore, NS probably have the balance of power. 3@s is going to take at least 7 tricks, and if pard has even 1 trick for me, I will do better down 1 (even doubled) than to defend a heart partial
And maybe they will bid over 3@S to get to an impossible game|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: So I stand to win more than lose by bidding 3@s than by letting them bid to 3@h
IN GENERAL- if the hand looks like a 3-level preempt, I should give very strong consideration to a 3-level preemptive overcall

mitche: Next. on to play: the opening lead was the @S8.. East wants to lead SMALL from a 3-card holding here, so pard will get a count on the suit
Second, when declarer led the @H10 at trick 2, East can play small. 
It's very difficult for you to lose the trump ace, so ducking the Ace can hardly hurt, and it avoids the defense winning the same trick twice
Also, when it turns out that declarer is void in spades, East might try shifting to CLUBS. 
Why clubls??|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: East can see that the diamond suit will run for 3 or 4 tricks for declarer, so she may try to get the clubs going for the defense before declarer can discard on the diamonds
Even if leading clubs picks off partner's Queen, it doesn't matter. The declarer's clubs may go away on the diamonds.
And that leads to the question - when should East take the @DAce?
Karen10: after getting a count?|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: She should wait until the SECOND round of the suit. She wants to see her partner's play to the diamonds. When it turns out that N has just 2 diamonds, she will know to win the Ace only when Declarer has no more of them
Questions?
How would East know to win the second round? 
mitche: East plays small to the first diamond. West plays his smallest diamond, showing an odd number of them...
And if West has an odd number, declarer must have an even number of diamonds. So East will see to win round 2.  If declarer has 4 diamonds, it doesnt matter......Got it?|

but I think it's also a rather good bid
If West passes, she may never get a chance to get into the bidding.
While it's pretty unusual to bid 1N with a singleton, in practice, it rarely hurts...|

Kibb: Would double be a bid?
mitche: West should not double 1@d because 
a) she has diamonds and 
b) she does not have hearts. All immediate doubles of a 1-bid are for takeout... 
Unless you are playing some very oddball system.|

If it wins (it will), then I would shift to a small spade
mitche: Play: one minor point. Declarer unblocked the @HK before she played clubs. I would wait to play the @HK until I knew that clubs did not split 4-0
If clubs do split 4-0, declarer would want to overtake the @HK to assure her contract|

mitche: I think the bidding up to 3@C was dead -on, by both sides.
over 3@C, East should allow partner to decide what to do. The way to do that is just pass. 
South will correct to 3@D, and West will know what to do ..
azin: double
mitche: West will be happy to double 3@d and lead a spade.
Karen10: thought I had to show the 6 loser as good overcall :(|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |

mitche: 3@d will fail by at least 2 tricks, and probably 3 of them
You have a decent hand, yes, but your club king may be useless (south's double shows clubs)
and pard knows more about your hand than you do about his.. So West is better placed to make the decision...|

mitche: EW are a bit unlucky on the deal (the spades are badly placed), but declarer had a chance to make the hand by leading a club toward her hand and finessing the club 10 instead of cashing the @DQ
When spades show up in the S hand, N must have both the @CA and Q to justify opening the bidding|
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: One of the skills you want to work on: As declarer, count up the total points the defenders have
EW have 22 points. So NS have 18 HCP. When S wins the @SA, that means N has a maximum of 14 HCP and without the @CA, she would not have enough strength to open
And without the @CQ, she would not have enough strength to open, either...
OK? questions?|

mitche: first - I would not bid 2@c with the N hand
a 2 over 1 overcall should show a good suit and also pretty nearly an opening hand...
second - holding 4 small cards in hearts, the suit bid on your right, means the hand may be a misfit.. don't put your neck in the noose with weak hands (unless you think you can survive)
and 4 small in a suit bid by your opponent is a dangerous holding|

mitche: It is hard to bid giraffes like the East hand ..
What should E do after hearing 2@C?
Neven decided to double, negatively.
I think with this kind of hand, the best thing to do is to bid your suits. 
So I would bid 2@s
And if pard does anything but raise spades, I would plan to bid diamonds, possibly to the 5 level|

West will try to slow down the bidding, because his hand is not good for slam (club K looks useless, 2 @D losers)

mitche: Play: When S produces the @CA and plays a small spade,  W should not take the @S finesse
Why should he rise with the @SA? 
If N had her bid, she would almost surely have 2 of the 3 missing key honors (@SK,@HA, @DK)
So if S turns out to have the @SK, N rates to have the missing red-suit honors. This assumes that N had full values for 2@C
And if N has the @SK, you may as well not take a finesse that rates to lose :)|
pg| ***** 97 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: I have a question: is all this discussion on reading the location of missing honors making sense with you?
The point is: when a player shows a certain amount of strength, you should expect him or her to have what they say they do 
And you can use that information to guess the location of missing honors ... but first, you need to do the homework - count points before you play to trick 1...
This works for declarer and defender|
pg| ***** 98 ***** |


nt||at| 
mitche: Back to the hand.. 
West needs to keep that valuable little @S3 in dummy. Why? 
Once the @SA goes away, the only path back to the W hand is to lead that @S3 to the 7. That allows you to finesse the @D suit. 
In fact, you probably should finesse the @DQ before you play trumps, because you don't have very many entries to hand!|

mitche: EW got a bit overboard...
Let's see what went on.
A) First, I think that S should bid 2@d here. 
Why? She has a good @D suit and almost an opener. Yes, the @H holding is a minus, but if you wait for the ideal hand, you won't bid very much at all
So S bids 2@d, even vulnerable...|
pg| ***** 113 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: But as things went, W bid a game - forcing 2@C
Now, time for a religious war - type of bidding question. Should East bid 2@s???
Wayne_LV:  2@h would be my bid
acetylsal: spades is a reverse  
Dianne0516: In 2/1 it is patnership agreement, but I play it looking for a suit to play
dee_dee_20: they are in a GF after 2@c   so 2@s is ok|
pg| ***** 114 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: Here is the discussion. 
a) Since West bid 2@C, game forcing, some people say that  East should bid her suits naturally. And the reverse after a 2 over 1 game - force should not show extra strength
b) On the other hand, some people say that after the 2 over 1, East should limit her hand's strength and not go past 2 of her original suit unless she has some extra values
So you need to discuss with partner whether the 2@S reverse shows extra strength here...|
pg| ***** 115 ***** |


nt||at| 
mitche: My personal opinion is that you should bid out your hand pattern, AND my opinion is far from unanimous
azin: I only considered the 2@S as showing extra value 16-17 points :):)
mitche: Azin is on the other side of the fence. BTW, 2@C doesn't necessarily deny holding 4 spades. 
gypsy1308: Why not bid 1s first then if he did have 4?
mitche: If West held something like KQxx, Jx, xx, AKJxx, then 2@c is correct, so you can bid your hand pattern naturally at the 2 level|
pg| ***** 116 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: You generally want to bid your longest suit first, if you can do so. 
And if you bid 1@S instead of 2@C, you can never get to a club game or slam when that is right
Give East Ax, AKQxx, x, Qxxx and 6@C is unbeatable -
So if you can do so, bid your suits as naturally as possible.
But back to our 6N problem.|
pg| ***** 117 ***** |


nt||at|
dee_dee_20: but with West's holding  after 2@s  should show support for pard 
mitche: After 2@s, 3@D should be saying, "if you have a @D stopper", please bid 3NT
I think that Neven thought, "Ah, 3@d shows a @D stopper"...
dee_dee_20: or " Ah pard has no @h's"
mitche: In either case, after Azin removed 3NT, the 3@D bid should have shown diamond strength (A or K or singleton) and be looking for slam in clubs or NT, (it sounds to me that 3@D was an "advance cue bid")|
pg| ***** 118 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: So I think the reason  for reaching the silly slam stems from a misunderstanding in what 3@D meant
Let me make one other point. As you recall, 2@C was GF. 
So 3@D could logically be thought to be a natural bid. There is no reason to use an artficial game force after you have already forced to game
But you should be sure to discuss whether the 4th suit is artificial, even in a game-forcing auction
I think it makes more sense to use the 4th suit to say, "do something intelligent, pard"
All right?|
pg| ***** 119 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: Without 2@d overcall, my preference is 1@h - 2@C/ 2@s - 3@h/ 4@h
Again, make sure you and pard are on the same page with reverses after 2 over 1 response...
I bid out hand pattern...
azin: Are we going to have PEACE now?|

Wayne_LV:  With the overcall: 1@h-2@d-3@d-3@H-P-4@h-p-p-p  ????
mitche: yes, because I want to get to the right trump suit ...
Oh, one other point. South is on lead against 6NT with a cashing AK. 
Unless she is afraid that the opponents can make a grand slam in something, she should double. So should she double?
I think so.|
pg| ***** 121 ***** |


nt||
pc|DA|at|
mitche: And now, what should S lead? I vote for the @DK
Here is why:  North, looking at the @DQ must realize that S would not lead an unsupported king against a slam
So that means S has the @DA, too.

mitche: West has a decision to make. 
With 8 HCP and a nice (but not great) 6 card suit, West should invite game. 
But how?
If you play 2N as invitational, then you should bid it. East will raise to 3N on a maximum, and here, I think East should accept|

mitche: If you play 4-suit transfers, then West bids 2N as a transfer to 3@D
East should "pre-accept" by bidding 3@C, showing a maximum, 3 card support for diamonds, AND at least one of the top 3 honors in the suit.
And then West would happily bid 3N, knowing that East has a good @D fit|

mitche: If you use 4 suit XFR's you may also invite with an auction 1N - 2@C / 2@D @H or @S/ 2N
We discussed that last week, I think|

mitche: Thanks to Eileen for her generous assistance and support, and to all of you for your active and courteous attention and participation.
May the candidate of your choice win, as long as it's the same one I support :)
I am an old "pogo for president" supporter. :) :) :)
azin: who is running BTW?|

^b{ New Gadget for Major Raises: }|fp|1|ht|f|cs|3|at|
^b@2Partner opens 1 of a Major, say 1@s

- With a 4+ spade support and 12+ HCP use ^*uJacoby 2NT^*n

but:

- with 4+ spade support, 9-11 HCP and a singleton: Use ^*u3NT^*n           


{1@s - 3NT       3NT = 4+ spade support, 9-11 HCP and an unspecified singleton}|fp|1|ht|n|cs|3|at|


1@S  ^e4@C/@D/@H    9-11, 4+ spades, showing a ^*uvoid^*n in the suit bid

Now after 3NT ......
If opener is interested in knowing about the singleton, she bids 4@C:
1@s    ^e3NT
4@c   ^e4@D = singleton diamond
        ^e4@H = singleton heart
        ^e4@S = singleton club!!

In other words if opener is not interested, responder has not revealed her singleton

And what if partner opens 1@h?

^b@21@h

{ 1@h - 3@s   =  unspecified singleton (4+ @h support and 9-11HCP) }|fp|1|ht|e|cs|3|at|

And now, with 3NT opener asks where (if interested):
1@h ^e3@s
3NT  ^e4@c = clubs
^e4@D = diamonds
^e4@H = spades!!

and finally .......


1@h - 3NT  ^f^*uvoid^*n in @s
1@h - 4@C/@D   ^f^*uvoid^*n in the suit bid

When you use this splinter method you must have 9-11 HCP
Stronger hands go through Jacoby 2NT!
Many advantages .....You can differentiate between singletons and voids right away, and ....
Opener does not have to ask for the singleton if she is not interested in slam.
Therefore the defender will have a blind lead not knowing where the shortage is.

It does not have a name
You may call it Roland's splinters if you like :)
But I am not the one who devised them

mandm2: what about a Bergen raise here?
Walddk2: You can use Bergen if you don't use 'mine'
I prefer 'mine',  9-11 hand with a shortage is strong enough to force to game.|
