^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
He’s been mentoring in BIL for 2 years and lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

He learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|

^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play.

mitche: Hi, everyone and welcome to tonight's 2 over 1 teaching session. Please play 2 over 1 with standard carding, so we all are on the same page. Feel free to ask questions, comment, or just hang out
You are all bidding 2 over 1 with these conventions: fourth suit forcing, new minor forcing, and forcing 1NT... let's see what happens :)
OK - lets roll|

mitche: bidding - 
After 1@D, East wants to bid his 4 card heart suit, rather than to bid 1NT. Even with the 4333 shape, it's usually best to look for a 4/4 major suit fit
|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: What should 2NT mean here?
bclavey:  I have 8-9  points?
rejoiceall:  denies 4 card major
mitche: It should say "around 11 HCP, plus or minus" and it invites opener to bid 3NT on a decent hand|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: Should East bid 2NT?
shoeman:  I bid 2NT because a balanced hand and not enough to go higher - right or wrong?
rejoiceall:  if shut off, no but if invitational yes...P agreement   1NT = 6-9 pts
mitche: 2NT is not a drop-dead bid! It invites 3NT if opener has a good 14+ HCP hand|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||at|
donison:  Should I rebid my diamonds or 3 clubs?
rejoiceall:  problem was first E bid....1nt 6-9pts
donison:  I have denied 4 card majors
mitche: Time out, guys!
Your old instructor can't think and type at the same time, let alone read the mail :(
West was correct to rebid 2@C, not 2@d
When you rebid 2@C, your hand is sure to hold 5 diamonds. Why?|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: The auction should be:
1@D  - 1@H / 2@c - 3@d / 
Let's see why this is the right auction
A) we already discussed 1@H . You need to show your 4 card major when responding
B) 2@C shows a hand with up to 16 points or so, and since opener would rebid 1NT with a balanced hand, 2@c shows at least a 5 card D suit and very likely a singleton somewhere|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: c) After 2@C, East loves his cards. The minor suit aces and @DQ are all working cards
So he jumps to show a very good hand for his previous bidding.
i.e. a strongly invitational hand
Are we all OK with this analysis so far?|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: Good - What should West do after 3@D by east?
bjh346: 5@d
rejoiceall:  4 clubs?
donison:  bid 3@H to show a stopper in hearts?
mitche: We LOVE playing notrump games when possible, instead of minor-suit games.|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: Minor suit games are the fall-back contracts, because it's easier to take 9 tricks than 11... assuming that all 4 suits are under control
YES! bid 3@h, : Then East can look at his spades and if he has a stopper there, East can bid 3NT
But J10x is not a spade stopper. So East needs to revert to 4@D|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: West takes a deep breath and guesses whether to pass or bid game.
I think with 55 shape, and trusting the 3@d to show nearly an opening hand, west should bid 5@D
BILAsst10: could E bid 4@C to show has @C support also, has already shown @D support?|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: 4@C would be OK - but be careful.
The reason I said "be careful" - is that 4@c is a cue bid at this point. That East has the @CA is the only reason it works..
We need to move on - any questions then, on the bidding?
EW should get to 5@d. 3NT is a lucky make because W has the singleton @SQ...|

mitche: bidding:
East's 1@S bid is brave - and risky. Even with favorable vulnerability, the bid runs the risk of getting you in the soup
Change the @HJ to the @SJ, and I would be happier with 1@S
OK ... so 1@s is a bit risky. You want a good suit to overcall, especially when both opponents are bidding and your partner isn’t|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt||at|
shoeman:  I agree my @S overcall was risky, I prefer better cards
mitche: In any event, when East bids 1@S, what should South do?
She should pass
Why?|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: Because any bid she makes is wrong.
a 1NT bid should show a better opening bid after the overcall. S has a minimum opener
2@c should show a good club suit, and almost always 6 cards in length
any other bid is plainly wrong. So S should pass and just wait for the auction to proceed|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt||at|
rejoiceall:  shows clubs real suit
mitche: yes, 2@c shows a real club suit, but the S hand is not good enough to bid 2@c
And holding length in the suit that your RHO bid should slow you down.
The 1@C call was fine, but 2@c was a bit of an overbid.|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt||at|  
mitche: West's 2@s bid makes sense - a good hand, indeed, but also bad shape
4333 is a very strong negative factor in bidding.
So after west's 2@s, no one else has anything to say.|

mitche: Play: 
South led the @HA, the suit her partner bid. 
As you all know, leading unsupported aces in trump contracts is a bad idea most of the time, but here, with partner bidding the suit, it's more reasonable.
South continued the suit at trick two, obviously looking for a heart ruff.|
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


nt||at|
When N won the @SA, he elected to lead a club, not a third heart. 
I think I would have followed South's idea and led my highest heart, hoping pard  will ruff and lead a @D
Questions?
OK - 2 points in the play of the club suit. When N led a club, it was the 10. Remember?|
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: It was around trick 4
N would not have led the @C10 from any holding including the queen
So when S won the ace and returned a club at trick 5, declarer should play the JACK, not the King
OK?
shoeman:  yes - got it thx|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: Watch those spots, gang! Ask yourself, "what holding would the defender need to have for the lead to make sense?"
Reading cards is a skill that requires only that you ask, "why is the other guy doing what he's doing?" 
The answer will very frequently be very obvious. And if you practice asking, you will improve your card- reading skills
Promise!   OK?    Next deal

mitche: How many of you would open West's hand?  Anyone?
meganms: 3rd seat rule of 15
shoeman:  12 pts, 2 quick tricks yes
mitche: Second seat ... rule of 20|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: The rule of 20 (or as I prefer, the rule of 22)... add the number of high points to the lengths of your 2 longest suits. If you have 2 or more quick tricks and the total is at least 20, your hand is worth an opening bid
Here, the hand has 4333 shape and 12 HCP. ==== so the total is just 19. 
Pass|
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: Especially pass without spades. I would use a rule of 19 with favorable vulnerability and a good 4 card @S suit. Otherwise, pass.
Question on why W should pass??
But after the 1@c bid, East has a pretty good hand. What should he bid?
rejoiceall:  1 @D?|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: 1@d looks correct, but it's not. With balanced shape and 13-14 HCP, bid 2NT. 
shoeman:  its that same flat hand issue! -1 hcp
mitche: Here, I would lie a point because East has such quality points – AKQ  tripleton's usually a negative, but when pard opens that suit (1@C), you are happier than if he opened something else|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: So East should bid 2NT
rejoiceall:  but not 13-14 pts, 12 pts
mitche: If East bids 1@d, you see the problem that can arise.
After 1@S overcall, there is no longer any bid he can make to show his hand's strength.
Raising 1@C to 3@C with only 3-card support is just asking for trouble.|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


nt||at| 
mitche: I would have even preferred a balancing double to 3@C. If I wind up playing a 4-3 heart fit, it's probbly no worse than 3@c
So the auction should be: all pass
No, seriously! No one has an opener, and 4th seat is not a rule of 15 hand .. so everyone passes
mitche: You know the rule of 15?|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


nt||at|
BILAsst10: E does have rule of 15 I think
shoeman:  yes I have rule of 15 count 12 hcp and 3@S's

** Note moviemaker: Mitch never did address this point. 
12 hcp - 1 for the 4333 and NOT having the spades suit...The Rule of 15 is about owning the @s suit
More on Rule of 15 at the end of this presentation.|

mitche: bidding:
East's 2@s bid is interesting. Megan was thinking that "I have 3 card support and a good hand for my previous pass"
But here's the problem: West passed the balancing double, which should show a minimum opener
Should west pass over the double? I think not.|
pg| ***** 120 ***** |


nt||at| 
mitche: A better bid might be 1NT - showing a balanced hand too big to bid 1NT originally
If West does bid 1NT, then East might bid 2@s, but not after the pass
meganms: not even to show support? P knows I am weak as I did not support first up|
pg| ***** 121 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: The problem that occurs when you underbid early on is that you very frequently cannot ever catch up with where you should be.
Remember last deal. where EW wound up in a poor 3@c contract? Same idea.
Megan's comment is true, but why would you want to play 2@s with 16 or 17 points? Down 1 doubled is more than any score your opponents could make on their own 
And West's pass meant "minimum opener"
|
pg| ***** 122 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: This idea of showing extra values by bidding when you do not have to (also known as making a "free bid") is central to constructive bidding
7047:  yes....I wasn't sure how to show my big hand
mitche: If you bid when you don't need to, to keep the auction alive, e.g., you are almost always showing extra values. That is true for Standard American or 2 over 1
Questions, especially on the important point of showing extra values?
7047:  really a key concept
mitche: yes, it is :)|

mitche: bidding: 
Transfer bids are on over 2NT or the auction 2@C - 2@d/ 2N
So 3@h was a transfer to 3@S
South was correct to pass 3@s with her really weak hand. A raise to 4@s or a rebid of 3NT needs about 5 points or so, since 2NT shows 20-21 HCP|
pg| ***** 147 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: I would like to make one final point on bidding before we go on to play. West has a big heart suit. 3@h is sure to be an impossible contract for NS, so W should double the artificial 3@h bid to request a heart lead
If West doubles 3@h, then N should still "complete the transfer" with 3 card support for spades.|

mitche: Play: East's first obligation on this auction is not to blow a trick, so the spade lead worked out OK.. 
But gee, what damage a heart would have done!! Guys, look for opportunities to double artificial bids to help pard out on defense
7047:  excellent pt...wish i could remember to do those things
On defense.. West won the @CA and then cashed the @CJ at trick 6 or 7|

meganms: I hate to lead doubletons. I did consider it - particularly with the heart transfer
mitche: Hang onto the @CJ and lead the heart king...
You do not want to release the master card in the suit declarer wants to set up. The heart king cannot hurt the defense.
|
pg| ***** 163 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: And that means - declarer should not pull trumps too quickly. When the 4-1 split reveals itself, declarer must try to set up her side suit before the defenders exhaust him of trumps in her hand
This is a very hard hand for declarer. If the defense gets either red suit going early, you will probably go down...|

mitche: bidding: South's double is minimum.
bjh346: I know I'm in the corner now :)
mitche: So when North bids 2@s, showing about 7 or 8 points to a maximum of about 10, Kit should just pass
With North's hand, I would have raised 3@S to 4...|
pg| ***** 173 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: For South to raise 2@S to 3 should show 16  - 18 or 19 dummy points 
If you have a decent 19 HCP, S could raise 2@S to 4 all by herself...
Remember that thing about free bids? 
North's 2@S was one of them, which is why I said it showed about 7 points|

mitche: Now, on to play:
East has a really tough opening lead problem. If you are going to lead a diamond, do not underlead the @DA. 
It's bad enough to lead a suit with an unsupported ace. But underleading the ace could be a disaster. What would happen if S has a singleton, which is a strong possibility on this auction?|
pg| ***** 186 ***** |


nt||at|
meganms: yes good point
mitche: If N has the @DK, then the defense may never score a diamond trick. So if you must lead the suit, lead the ace...
Once again, when the defense turns out to have 4 trumps, it's probably better to stop playing spades and to give up a couple of clubs.|
pg| ***** 187 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: Declarer would be much happier for the defense to lead hearts. So Barb, look to clubs, where the suit is stronger. You have just two 2 top losers, after which you may have 2 winners...OK???
The rule of thumb is - if you can afford to lose your sure losers, give them up and let the other side figure out how to play hearts for you... Sometimes they will do you a favor :)|

mitche: Summary of the important points from this evening's deals:- 
1) free bids show extra values. when you do not take a free bid, you deny having extras -
think about board 4, where W passed over a reopening double with an 18 count, and then had to bid 2N to try to catch up|
pg| ***** 189 ***** |


nt||at|
2) when your hand pattern is 4-3-3-3, you need extra strength to compensate for your bad shape.
Go slow with 4333 hands
3) remember that 1@C - 2NT shows about 12 or 13 points and a very flat hand without major-suit length|
pg| ***** 190 ***** |


nt||at|
4) remember to bid a 4-card major as responder. 
That, folks, is about it for this evening, Thanks to Eileen for her generous assistance, and thanks to all of you for your courteous participation. Happy Thanksgiving to all! I will be online Thursday evening in BIL for general discussion or to play. See you then.|

^b{ Rule of 15 for 4th seat openers }|fp|1|ht|f|cs|3|at|

^b@2From : "Standard bidding with SAYC" by Ned Downey and Ellen Pomer


A good fourth seat guideline is the Rule of 15 (Cansino count).
Take your HCP and add the number of spades you hold. If the total is 15 or more, open. Why? 
Ron Klinger's "Guide to better bridge":

"When each side has about 20 points, each side can usually make 8 tricks in a trump fit. 
Owning the spade suit is, therefore, very important. 
It can mean that you can bid up to 2@s and the opponents will have to bid to the three-level 
to prevent your making 2@s. 
Therefore, be reluctant to open with 10-12 points if short in spades... 
but by all means open with length and strength in spades."



Let's look at 3 hands where, after 3 passes you hold:|
