^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
He’s been mentoring in BIL for 2 years and lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

He learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |

^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play.

mitche: Hi, everyone and welcome to tonight's 2 over 1 play and discuss session. Please play 2 over 1 (2/1 by an unpassed hand is GF and 1NT forcing) with standard carding, so we all are on the same page. 
You are all bidding 2 over 1 with these conventions: fourth suit forcing and new minor forcing,
OK, folks, let's start! Happy bidding, playing, and discussing! ...|

sk|s|lb|*bPlease choose your bid.^^x|mb|2hppp|sk||at|mitche: bidding: Think W hand has better options than 2@D.  An overcall primarily shows a good suit, and Kxxx is not nearly good enough. 
If diamonds were better, or your shape was, e.g x, KJx, KQJxxx, J10x, then you might bid 2@D with
just 10 -11 HCP
But Kxxx is never a good enough suit to overcall with
You need a good suit KJ10xx(x) or so, and about 10-11 points for a 2-level overcall.
That is a rock-bottom minimum.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||at|This is the kind of hand I would overcall 2@D with: 
xx, Kxx, AQ10xxx, Kx
2nd; with support for all unbid suits, if W hand is to bid, a double would be a better idea.  
And I wouldn't even mind passing with the W hand.
I would either pass or double. I am aggressive in competing, so I would double and hope pard doesn't bid 3@H on a 4-card suit|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||at|When bidding comes back to S after the 2@D call, a better idea than bidding 2@H is to reopen with a balancing double.
It is a "reopening" double, meaning "do something, pard".|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||at|The somethings are 
a) pass with 8 or more points,  a good holding in the overcall suit and a misfit for my spades.  
b) if you have a good holding in the unbid major and no support for my suit, bid it.
c) if you can't stand the 3 level, support my spades with 2 to an honor or 3 small
So S will reopen the bidding (another term for balancing) with a double and N will bid 2@H
S should NOT bid 3@H.. 
Why??|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: If N held 4 hearts and 6(**) or more points, he would have made a negative double over 2@D
So N has a weaker hand or just 3 hearts...

(**mm: requirements for a 2-level X might be slightly higher for others: 8+ with 4-card, 7+ with a 5-card )

mitche: Why should East have passed 2@D?|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||at|a) the overcall says "one suit", in this case, west advertises diamonds
b) East had no support for diamonds, really. Ax is a nice doubleton, but it is still only a doubleton!
c) East's spades are poorly placed. The spade bidder was on her LEFT, so the @SKJ rate not to be as valuable as they would have been if someone else bid the suit
So East has a misfit and wasted spade strength. When you have a bad hand for partner, keep the  auction low
Let me repeat that: if you have a poor hand for partner, keep the bidding low!|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||at|Wayne_LV:   Mitch do you use Rule of 9 to convert the reopening double to penalty after a "trap pass" ?
mitche: Wayne, I like the rule of 12 and 10, as Klinger wrote it up..

Reason:
a) dummy is sure to be short in spades. and weak
So dummy's most likely source of tricks is spade ruffs
b) leading from a suit like Kxxx is very risky. If pard did not support the suit, you may be blowing a trick

mitche: bidding: The auction was about what I would expect from most tables at an average duplicate event
Noah121: Would it have been dangerous for East to "pre-balance" with a double?
mitche: I was thinking about that.|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt||at| 
East could have doubled 2@s, but the problem is that he can work out that west has at most 9 or 10 HCP, probably less
So NS likely have the balance of strength, or the points are very closely divided, and the 3-level
is a difficult place to look for a fit
I would have made a balancing X with the E hand, if that were possible
When W doesn't balance, S should draw the conclusion that W has spades 
(with short spades, W will reopen with a double... )
|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Someone asked if N should have used 1NT forcing, instead of a 2@s raise
My preference is to use "constructive" raises. 
A constructive raise is 3 card support, 7+ to 10 dummy points.
apdumpling:  there is 11 dummy pts here...
mitche: With 3 card support and 11 or 12 dummy points, I would use a forcing 1N followed by a raise to the 3 level
I count the singleton as at most 2 support points. Dummy has just 3 card S support|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: With a 4th trump (change a small club to a small spade) , I would make a Bergen 3@D bid
Declarer needs trumps both to lead toward his hand and to ruff.. He cannot do both, really, so
counting the singleton with only 3 card support as 3 points is too optimistic
I am pretty aggressive in bidding, but I really need to have a 9 card fit to get pushy with just 8 HCP|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: As it turns out, 2@S is plenty .. You would not want to invite pard to bid game with a lousy 14 point hand, and treating this dummy as a limit raise will cost you much more in the  long run than just contracting for a part score|

nt||up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: OK - on to the play
Leading from 3 small is a tricky thing. 
cet804:  top of nothing
mitche: If I am playing with my normal pard, I lead small.. But some partnerships will lead top of nothing. 
The problem with top of nothing is that it looks like a doubleton, and the problem with leading small is partner will put either 4 card length or an honor in your hand
Eddie Kantar says "best to avoid leading from 3 small"|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


nt||at|cet804:  I don't lead a doubleton unless my partner bid it
mitche: cet804, that may be too rigid.. Leading from shortness is very often a good idea.
If I had the W hand, I would lead a small heart... but here, that is kind of unlucky.. 
Anyway. EW defended very well to defeat the contract. S could have (and probably should have)
played either the @C9 or @CQ at trick 1, probably the Q. Playing the A guarantees a club loser
And if the @CQ loses to the K, the 9 may be enough to deter E from continuing the suit at trick 2|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Apart from that, there isn't too much to say. EW took all the tricks they could, and declarer was pretty much helpless to stop them from doing so
West did well not to take the trump ace early -- that was good...|

at|mitche: : bidding: Let's look at East's opening bid:
When you lack a 5 card major, you usually open your longer minor (or 1NT if that's right)
If you have equal length in clubs and diamonds, as E does here, bid 1@C with 3-3 in the minors  and 1@D with 4-4 in the minors
Some partnerships agree to open 1@C with equal length in the minors, but that is definitely not standard treatment!
So I would open E with 1@D, not 1@C|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: But as it was, E opened 1@C and S doubled (he was a passed hand, remember)
How many of you agree with the double?
I think that S's double was correct because 
a) he had perfect shape for the double and while only 9 HCP, he had 1 1/2 quick tricks 
So his points were "good points", not a lot of "quacks"|
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


nt||at|cet804:  2 quacks
mitche: Yes, 2 quacks, but one of them accompanied his majesty..
So double looked good to me. Also, being non-vul against vulnerable opponents is a very good time to get frisky
Now, the 1@H bid is forcing, as most people play it.. After a takeout X, a 1-level bid is forcing for 1 round|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: W might well have redoubled to show 10 HCP, but I like 1@H because the suit is good
So are we all OK with 1@H?
OK - N has a clear pass, and 1@S looks right on the E cards
And that brings us to 2@D    How many of you agree with 2@D?
S bid every point in his hand (and a couple of points in the N hand) when he doubled|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Also, the bidding did nothing to improve the S hand
So bidding violates MaryAnn's rule: 
MaryAnn Dufresne, a master teacher in Florida, wrote in her book "bridge with bells and whistles" (a great book, btw), 
"don't tell the same story twice"
S's double told his entire story. Balanced hand, 10-12 points
So 2@D is a poor bid. How poor? on a scale of 1-10, I would say about a zero.|
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: good. Now, if 2@D showed a good hand, W's bid of 2@H had to show extra values
Why?    West's 1@H bid could have been made without the @SK.. right??
So W has more points than 1@H showed, and a pretty good card, at that, the K of a suit her partner had bid
So 2@H showed a hand that the bidding improved.
Based on that, East has an easy bid of 3NT|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: It's important for you to see that E's bid was based on the fact that she could expect a decent @H suit AND another working card from West
It's possible that S could have had a hand with 5 good diamonds and the @HA, let us say, 
in which case 3N would have no play
But life and bridge don't come with guarantees|
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


nt||at|
BILAsst10: wondering how the bidding should have gone - with 1@D opening bid
mitche: I think the bidding might go 1@D - 1@H / 1@S – 2@C(new minor forcing, even by passed hand). 3NT
2@C is forcing - either 4th suit or new minor -- at this point, they are functionally equivalent|

at|anniebmisc: never know whether to bid stayman there or transfer
mitche: bidding: A while ago, we did a lesson on showing 4-5 shape in the majors - - here is a summary:
The bidding 1NT – 2@H – 2@S shows 4 spades, 5 hearts, and invitational values**
(**mm: in sayc this would be 5-5 and invitational)
mitche: S has much more than an invitational hand of 8 or 9 points.
So to show 4-5 shape and game-forcing values, S should bid this way: 
start with Stayman:  1NT - 2@C/ If opener shows a 4 card major, you just bid game in that major
|
pg| ***** 102 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: But if you have my luck, pard bids 2@D. 
So you now jump to 3-level of your 4-card suit** (in this case, 3@S)
(**mm: which is the Smolen convention. sayc jumps to 5-card here showing 5-4)
mitche: the advantage of smolen is finding 5-3 fit in a major without missing the chance of locating 4-4 
fit
|
pg| ***** 103 ***** |


nt||at|So let's suppose that N recognized that S has 4 spades and 5 hearts. Which suit should he pick for trumps?
If you have a choice of playing in 4-4 or 5-3 major fit, pick the 4-4 fit
Why?|
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: 
a) you can make either hand the "master hand", i.e. you can ruff in either hand
b) the 5-3 fit will allow you to develop 2 discards! playing in 5-3 fit with 4-4 side fit doesn't allow you to us the side suit for pitches
You are all on top of that discussion ... Great!! :)|

Notice that the lead of the @C2 blew a trick for the defense, allowing declarer to win a club trick he could not have gotten on his own
analisals: so diamonds is the best bad lead?|
pg| ***** 114 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: leading a passive diamond does not cost a trick (but it costs a tempo).. Declarer can always finesse in diamonds...
but an even more passive trump lead is safest... It turns out that nothing beats 4@S or 4@H, but the @CA surrenders an extra trick
Once again, I recommend both Mike Lawrence's and Eddie Kantar's books on defense here
I recommend using Smolen... it is a good, but not essential convention.

As East's hand lacks any aces, it might be better to invite game with a 3@S bid
|
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: West wondered about bidding 2@H... 
If you have an agreement that "advancer" may bid a new suit whenever his/her hand has tolerance for overcaller's suit, then W might bid 2@H. 
But ...that requires you and your partner to have an explicit agreement to use that kind of bid
But yes, here, your 2@S bid is correct, I think, 
East's 4@S bid was pushy..|

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: S did well not to lead the @DA
Especially after the last hand :)
Note that N should not be interested in getting a ruff. She should be eager to force declarer to ruff twice, 
Then declarer is guaranteed to fail.|
pg| ***** 139 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Questions on why that's so?
GertieO: then N has control ..... of trump
analisals: how does north know about south's clubs?
mitche: She does not
MICK357: I dont want her to sluff a @d on the club ruff 
mitche: But when the @CQ comes down at trick 1, N might think that S has club length|
pg| ***** 140 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: BTW, I would have bid 2@D with the S hand, instead of passing...
When I have a singleton in the overcalled suit and Axx of my partner's suit, I will raise. 
Key point: East's 1@S overcall was OK .. East could also have bid 3@H over 2@S, saying "I am inviting game and oh, yeah, I have heart cards"
If E had bid 3@H, west would bid 4@H. 
That would probably make, as long as declarer finesses in diamonds|
pg| ***** 141 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: The only defense that beats 4@H is for N to play @SA and a second spade.. 
I think that if E bids past 2@S, it is impossible for EW to avoid game... 
If S leads a spade against 4@H, the contract will fail by 2 tricks .. @SA , ruff, club, ruff, @DA 
but S may lead a spade anyway, hoping N has a quick entry in trump or spades..
Leading singletons in suits that the opponents have bid and raised is high-risk, high reward. 
If it works, it works very well, but if it doesnt, it's a big loser...|
pg| ***** 142 ***** |


nt||at|analisals: leading an ace there would ordinarily be a bad lead?
MICK357: not when you count the number of spades
BILAsst10: not in this case as North knows south has at most 1 spade, but south doesnt know North has the @S Ace

mm: You can play the hand Double Dummy if you wish

sk|s|lb|*bPlease choose your bid.^^2h|mb|2hppp|sk||at|mitche: bidding: I would have opened 1NT with the W hand... 
With a balanced 16 count, it avoids rebid problems, even with the 5 card spade suit
idalia2:  I am never sure but I worried about weakness in both minors 
mitche: I don't mind 1NT when I have honors in both suits...
Anyway, the contract would likely be 1NT
I don't think that either N or S would be able to come in after 1N..

nt||at|anniebmisc: partner plays DONT; 2@c bid would have led me to hearts
mitche: Bidding DONT with 4-4 is a good way to get your head handed to you! DONT is based on distribution, not HCP
Reason: 4-4 is a balanced hand, and the cruddy suit quality of the @H suit should deter N from being too frisky
anniebmisc: I've been beheaded several times lately, but not over a DONT bid

(mm: distribution is 5-4 here, not 4-4)|

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: East needs to hang onto 1 more @D and one less club to defeat 2@H 
How should she know to do this?
The @C2 should be from an ODD number of clubs, either 1 or 3. If W had a singleton club, she would probably have had more to say than passing over 2@h
That allows E to count South's hand completely.|

(mm: at 4-card end-position, leading a club should work better than leading a @d with same reasoning, declarer should be void and partner should have 2 clubs left including the Q)

By clicking on the cards, you can play the hand Double Dummy,
This concludes this presentation. Hope you enjoyed, Karen10|
