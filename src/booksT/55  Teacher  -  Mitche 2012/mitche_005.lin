^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
He’s been mentoring in BIL for 2 years and lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

He learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|

^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play.

mitche: bidding:
East's hand is "only" 15 points, but it's a pretty good 15 point hand, as such things go.
East should plan to bid 1@C and then reverse by bidding 2@d, even if partner responds 1@h
Why?
The 5th club and the "quality" suit are worth about 2 points, so this 15 point hand is really closer in value to 17 than 15
A reverse announces a hand worth at least a king more than a minimum opener, and this is surely that  kind of hand.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: There are 2 problems with the 1N rebid: 
a) the hand is too good, and 
b) the singleton heart is a deterrrent 
If East does bid 2@d, then West should bid 2@S, fourth suit forcing. The 2@S bid does NOT promise spades|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: The fact that west has them is only accidental.. when either unpassed partner bids the 4th suit in an auction, it is game forcing. 
East's 2@d says "16+ points", and the 2@s bid says "we are game-bound. Tell me more"
East's rebid is going to be 2NT
Why? West's spade bid was artificial. East is showing the spade stop, just in case West was thinking about No Trump|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: Questions yet?
There should be one.
What should East bid with a genuine spade suit?
Well, if she had one, she should have bid it instead of 2@d 
So that is why 2@s by West can stand to be artificial. West knows that East has at most 3 spades, because she didnt bid them when she could have, at the 1 level|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: West can bid 3@d after 2NT, to say "4 card @d support" and good values
6@d is a make, as the cards sit (kind of lucky, but always there). |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt||at|
One other issue. We concentrated on opener's rebid. But what about West's 1@h bid?
If you are playing Walsh - style, you usually skip over a 4-card @d suit to show your 4-card major
When would you NOT bypass a 4 card @d suit?
West has a hand that is worth forcing to game after East opens, right?|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: So west can afford to respond 1@d. Over East's expected bid of 1N, West will now bid 2@h
duffer66: will not east assume you have 5 diamonds/4 hearts and opener with that sequence?
mitche: yes, he should... "technically, that sequence shows 5 diamonds and 4 hearts"|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: Now, if West bid 1@d, East should raise to 2 (or even 3 :) ) 
East's hand is worth 18 or 19 support points for diamonds... the 17 we counted before, plus a couple more for the singleton
If East feels strongly about it, she might bid 3@h over 1@d to announce a game-going hand with a singleton heart.
West will not be thrilled about 3@h and he would then bid 3N|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: So the recommended auction is 1@c - 1@d/ 3@h - 3N.
That should end the auction.. Getting to 6@d is really iffy... It is at best 50-50, because you need to bring in 3 suits out of 4 (either the @hQ or @sK, to eliminate the spade loser AND the diamond. 
And then you need to pick up the clubs for 1 loser ugh.. |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: west could also have reversed into 2@s after 1@h.. that would really have been better|

mitche: bidding: this was a very standard EW auction.
After 1NT gets passed back to South she has to decide whether to balance. 
Her depressing 4333 shape should be enough to keep her from doing so.
So 1NT will be the final contract at most tables|

up|40|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: The opening lead of the @S5, 
If honest, means that S has just 1 card higher than that 5-spot
If it's the 10 or J, then the K is with the opening leader
Why? The rule of 11 tells declarer that this is so. It also tells South that declarer has 3 cards higher than the 5
So S knows the suit's layout (4333) and approximate card placement in the suit at trick 1|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |

mitche: Declarer can count on 2 spades (after the lead), 2 high hearts, and a diamond - he decided to set up the club suit to develop the 2 winners he needed to guarantee it. |
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: He can then either duck a heart, hoping for a 33 division, or try for a couple of extra @d tricks. 
A deep finesse (low to the @d8 ) works to set up 2 extra tricks, as the cards sit.
Well done|

sk||at|mitche: bidding
What should East do after the double?
If West could be guaranteed to hold 4 hearts, then 4@h is certainly correct. 
But West could conceivably have just 3 of them.
If I had East's hand, I would start with 2@c instead of 4@h.|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: The initial meaning of 2@c is "bid your 4 card suit", and my preference for West, over 2@c is to bid 2@s, his better major
East can then bid either 3NT or 3@h.
The problems with 4@h are - a) may be facing just 3 card support. b) holding club strength in front of the @c bidder means that the KJ10 are not pulling their full weight|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: So if W bids 2@s, I would then bid 3@h, expecting W to bid 4 with the right kind of hand
The ADVANTAGE of 4@h is that most of the time, it's the right contract...|

mitche: Play - when declarer cashes the @hAK at tricks 2 and 3, she guarantees her defeat.
A better play: cash the @hA at trick 2 and lead a small club at trick 3:
If the @cQ is allowed to win, then declarer should lead a trump from dummy.
When she gets the bad news, she can play small from hand. This means that South cannot pull her trumps and cash spades.|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: Declarer has 3 club tricks,3 diamonds, and the @sA, so she needs to assure herself of taking her sure winners. 
well, Declarer  can't play the @hAK. She is happy to hold her losers to 2 trumps and the @cA
This is not an easy hand to play. It's very seductive to play top trumps and just knock out the @cA. 
But 1 time in about 16, you will go down when you get a 4-1 trump split|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: So you can play safely, giving up chances for an overtrick by knocking out the @cA first and by ducking a trump
FM75:  What should E be thinking to realize the play of clubs before two trump tricks?
mitche: East should ask the question - the hand looks really easy. What could go wrong? And the only thing that could ruin 4@h is a bad tump division|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: Once you recognize the potential problem, you can deal with it. Also, since there is only a very small chance of a club ruff, it looks right to lead a club early, before playing the second round of trumps.|

mitche: bidding: the 1@h is a "rule of 20" opener: 
10 cards in 2 suits, 2 quick tricks, and 11 HCP. The @sK singleton is a big minus, but everything else is OK...
And 2@d is automatic - enough points to insist on game after East opened, and a 5 card suit
What should West bid after 2@h?|
pg| ***** 130 ***** |


nt||at|masse24: Depends on if 2@h was the "default rebid" or if it promised 6 cards....
mitche: 3@s should be a "mini-splinter", showing a singleton spade and heart support. 
So that bid is out. 
I think that the choices are 2@s or 3@h|
pg| ***** 131 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: If you knew that East has a 6 card suit, 3@h is standout.
It isn't 100% certain that E has 6 of them, but I would still bid 3@h
Why 3?|
pg| ***** 132 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: As you remember, "fast arrival", jumping to game in a game-forcing auction, shows a minimum hand for your previous bidding
West has almost 2 kings more than a minimum 2 over 1..His 6 loser hand means the hands are in the slam zone
so 3@h gives East the best chance to describe his hand in search of a slam
If East bids 3@s (a control bid), EW may wind up in slam. 
6@h depends on guessing the @d suit|
pg| ***** 133 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: so the bidding might be: 1@h - 2@d/2@h - 3@h/3@s - 4@c
East will now bid 4@h (no @d control) and EW can then stop at 4 
I think the auction showed "italian cue bids"
I don't know that you want to get to a 50% slam. The books say that you should have at least a 55% chance to make slam?|
pg| ***** 134 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Because you lose the game bonus, you need better than even-money to bid to a slam. 
Wayne_LV:  much easier to get to slam on this hand if E opens 2@h (2@h-p-2N-P-3@S-P-4N-P-5@h-p-6@h)
mitche: I would not like to get to slam no matter what East opens with
Imagine a diamond lead with N having the @dAQ
FM75:  yes. but a club lead might be more likely on the auction?|
pg| ***** 135 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Or a trump lead, or club or spade.. East has to find a home for 3 losers, the clubs and the diamond. 
The @sA eats one of them, dummy can ruff a club, but then declarer has either a club and a diamond, or 2 clubs, or 2 diamonds to dispose of...
I want to make this point clear: if you get to 50-50 slams, over the long haul, you will lose ...You want better-than-even odds|
pg| ***** 136 ***** |


nt||at|FM75:  Is there a difference in percentage "good slams" Imps vs MPs
mitche: at matchpoints, if you need a top, you may wind up taking a shot - but at IMPS, over the long run, it's best to stay out of close slams (unless you are behind and need a swing)|

FM75:  p, my clubs were so good I almost raised you LOL:)
mitche: bidding:
Over 1NT, the DONT convention works like this: a bid shows the suit bid and a higher-ranking one.
Usually, you are 5-5, but if your suits are OK, you may be 5-4...
I would have preferred the @hK to be the @cK, but I am kind of conservative when many of my points are in my short suits|
pg| ***** 157 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: Especially when I am vulnerable, I like to have something in reserve - but that is my bidding style
Some people are very aggressive about overcalling 1NT - it all depends on how much you like to stir the pot with your bids|

up|40|pf|y|at|mitche: Play:
mitche: let's start with the opening lead. I think it's correct to lead 4th best from a 5 card suit, Leading the @d10 should promise the 9 or a doubleton...
In any case, the only card that the @d10 opening lead absolutely guarantees South  not to have is the @dJ|
pg| ***** 171 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: So playing a small diamond at trick 2 is certain to cost the defense a trick (but so did the @d10 cost a trick...)
At trick 2, N does better to lead a heart. East has to guess to play the @hJ, 
And with the 1NT opener, East may very well go wrong.
Sometimes, the best defense is to put declarer to a guess before he's ready for it|
pg| ***** 172 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So - one other question: Someone asked "how could S compete over 2@c?"
some people play "systems on" in this situation, where a double of 2@c is Stayman
Other people use "Lebensohl", a very important convention, which you want to learn as you advance. An even better version of Lebensohl is "Rubinsohl", or "transfer Lebensohl", but that is a bit more than we are ready to handle in here.|

mitche: OK --- we can go on and on with this deal.. it turns out that NS can take a lot of tricks in a red suit, but they have a hard time gettng there after the DONT bid
Well, three final comments for tonight: first, thanks to everyone here, to Eileen for her generous assistance, and to all of you for your courteous attention and participation. 
Second, for those who observe it, happy Hanukkah.|

mitche: finally, I will be away on Christmas and New Years day for lessons. I will be around on Jan 1 for our BIL New year's celebrations...If you see me, please invite me to play with you ...
