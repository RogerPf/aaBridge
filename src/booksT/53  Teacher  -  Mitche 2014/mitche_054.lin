^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, 
if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. 
We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. 
My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, 
so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving 
and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."


Mitch Edelman aka   "mitche"






MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.

at|Had this team been playing constructive raises, opener would bid game at this point, since he counts only 5 losers and 
would give pard 9 losers for his constructive raise in hearts.|

at|mitche:  Bidding:  Please look carefully at West's hand.   It has how many losers?|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|
10 of them.  When you raise 1@H to 2@H, you should have what is called a "constructive" raise, 
showing  ^*b3-card support, 7-10 HCP and 9 losers^*n. 
There is a way to differentiate between a really poor raise (like West's hand) --  and a more constructive one (bidding 2@h)
With the really poor raise: bid 1NT, followed by either passing a 2@H rebid or correcting 2-of-a-minor to 2@H|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||
at|So lesson 1 for tonight:  When you have a really cruddy raise of opener's major (3 cards, flat shape, lots of losers) -
use forcing 1NT to tell pard.
The auction 1@H - 1NT/ 2@C – 2@H shows a very poor raise.
BILAsst10:  This could be only 2-card support also?
Mitche:  Yes, a "false preference" to 2@H here would be on a hand like this:  @sKxx  @h xx  @dQJxx   @Cxxxx
You would correct the 2-of-either-minor rebid by opener to 2@H because after a forcing 1NT, 
opener may have had to rebid a 3-card minor.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  For example:
@sAxx,@hKJxxx, @dKxx, @cQx  opens 1@H,  and rebids 2@D over 1NT.
OK, now what should East have done over 2@H?  East has a pretty decent hand (5 losers) after the 2@H bid.  Yes? 
She probably would love to be in game over a "constructive" 2@H raise.   
(9 + 5 = 14), which when subtracted from  24 = 10 winners
So with a fit, she expects to take 10 tricks most of the time.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||
at|Finally, (to quote hall of fame player Steve Robinson - one of my mentors)
"the best game invite is just to bid game!"  or from Marty Bergen   "he who know, goes". 
As East’s hand evaluates to around 18 Bergen points, she should probably bid 4@H and not put pressure on partner.
"9 + 5" :  A "constructive" 2@H raise = a 9-loser hand.  And East has a 5-loser count.  
So according to losing trick count,  you add losers in both hands, and subtract from 24, 
and that is the number of tricks you expect to take.

Declarer arranged to lead trump toward her hand, correctly, and everyone got the tricks they deserved, no more, no less.

at|mitche:  Bidding:  North should have 6 diamonds for her 2@D rebid.  
If she has just 5, her hand either is balanced (5332), or she has a second 4-card suit.  
So 2@D looks and is the right bid for her hand.  
If her hand were balanced,  she just bids 1NT, or if not,  she bids her other 4-card suit.|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt||at|Oh, and so as not to distress the editor, when I said "balanced' I should have said, "no wilder than 5332".  
After 2@D, it’s really hard for E/W to get into the bidding.   No one has an unbalanced hand.   
South's pass of 2@D is on the cautious side - bidding 2NT on her values could be a disaster ,  
but since neither opponent bid spades,  it is unlikely that anyone has a 5-card @S suit.
I might try 2NT if I felt lucky. 
As it turns out, passing was the right decision today.

at|mitche: Play:  When East led the @SAce, West was expected to show "attitude" as first signal.  
So the @s6 says "I am not interested in a spade continuation".   
East had nothing better than to continue spades, and she did, playing the @SK and then the @S5.
What does West  know when she won the @DAce at trick 4? |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


at| 
She knows that N has 6 diamonds, 3 spades, and therefore 4 cards in hearts and clubs.  
And the club suit is working for declarer - the @CQ is either in declarer's hand or can be finessed.|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Now West can try for an extra defensive trick by leading the @S10 when she is in with the @DAce.  
What happens?|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


at|
If declarer ruffs low, East can overruff.  If declarer ruffs high -- the @D10 becomes a winner.   
And if declarer discards, it's a winner anyway.  
The only time leading the spade loses is if declarer has 2 hearts and 2 clubs to the 7 or lower,
but then declarer would have opened on a 9 point hand.|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt||at|It isn’t easy to spot an uppercut, as this play is known, but when they do come up, it’s nice to be familiar with the idea.
And if you have a name for it, you’re more likely to recognize it. |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt||cp|4|at| 
(MM:  An uppercut is a defensive play that involves one of the defenders ruffing high in the knowledge that an overruff by
the declarer will result in the promotion of a trump card in his/her partner's hand into a winner. 
Thus, the technique presents a type of trump promotion. |
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


cp|2|nt||
at|mitche:  Declarer had a counter play and she should have avoided the risk of the uppercut by leading her singleton heart 
to the Ace and a low trump from dummy.  
This is correct, because if W flies with her ace, then later Declarer can afford to ruff high.
Of course, if trumps are 4-1, with the Ace singleton, declarer is losing 2 trumps anyway.

at|mitche: Bidding:  After 1@C – 1@H, South's hand is mildly problematic.  
With only a 4-card club support and 10 points, bidding 2@H (limit raise in clubs or better) 
is a poor choice (North could have just 3 clubs!).  
So I guess 2@D is the least of evils.|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt||at|West's hand is also problematic. This looks like a misfit for E/W, and with a really bad hand, passing looks OK.  
I think the book that recommends 2@S on West's hand is waiting to be written, and I am not going to be its author.
However, it would have worked well here, since E/W can make 8 or 9 tricks in spades with normal play.  

So 3NT became the final contract.

at|mitche: Bidding:  West has an in-between type hand, better than a minimum 2@S bid in competition, 
not quite good enough to make a limit raise by cue-bidding 3@D.  
With that kind of hand, I find it best to make the slight underbid and then accept game invite.  
If I make the overbid, pard will get excited, bid game, and go down 1.
So Liza's 2@S bid was correct.|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


nt||at|Also, with length in the overcalled suit, someone is short in @Ds - if pard, she will be tapped (forced to shorten trumps) 
if the other defender is the one who is short, she will be able to ruff .  
Either way, holding length in the overcalled suit is a good excuse to go slow, 
until you know that pard's hand can take taps.

at|mitche:  Play:  Sometimes as defender, it's a mixed blessing to hold honors.  
Here, South could have been forced to yield an extra overtrick.
When Declarer played a @D to her @DJ, South must cash his second diamond and then exit with a heart,
otherwise declarer will endplay South with the @DAce and force him to lead to the good diamonds in dummy.
South knows that there is only 1 more diamond in play 
(he saw 12 of them between his hand, dummy, and the play to the first round of diamonds) 
so it can’t ever hurt to play the @DAce. |
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  As a defender, be aware of unprotected honors that can be used to throw you in.  
Here, the @DAce was unprotected in the sense of leaving South with no exit card, 
should South  be "thrown in" with declarer's last @D.
Cashing the @d Ace and "exiting" with the @hK leaves declarer with no possibilities to get to the good @d,
The endplay would force the defender to help declarer get to his dummy.  

A better way to say that is that S's play exposed him to an endplay. Sorry for the slip of the (typewritten) lip.|

With 10 HCP and a 5-card suit, S knows that N/S will be in game.  
So when no spade fit was disclosed, he bid 3NT.  
What should N have bid if she had 4-4 in the majors after 2@c? |
pg| ***** 87 ***** |

When the NT bidder has both majors, she should respond 2@H to a Stayman inquiry.
Up the line.|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Then AS LONG AS 2@C PROMISES A 4-CARD MAJOR, North will know what to do if South bids 2 or 3NT.
If you play 4-way Jacoby transfers  you probably use 2NT as a transfer to 3@D, right?  
That means that you must use Stayman to invite game in NT, so the auction 1NT – 2@C/ 2@H - gives you an issue
that pairs not playing that convention do not have.
If it is possible that 2@C does not have a 4-card major and pard bids 2@H over your stayman bid, 
you just bid 2NT.
BUT if you have 4 spades, you MUST bid 2@S over 2@H, just in case opener was 4-4 in the majors. |
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Example:
If N/S play 4-way transfers, the bidding would be 1NT – 2@C/ 2@H – 3@S/ Game forcing to 3NT.
Please remember this,  if you use 4-way Jacoby transfers. It comes up all the time!
jonnyquest: Doesn't the jump to 3NT promise four @S's?
mitche:  NOT if you play 4-way transfers where you must use 2@C as your invitational sequence.
(because 2NT is a transfer to diamonds)
jonnyquest: 1NT – 2@C – 2@H - 3NT (promises four @S's) whereas....3@S after a 2@H bid is generally considered a slam try in @H's|

at|mitche:  You could argue that 3NT should promise 4 spades 
(after all, if you are not bidding 3NT directly, (1NT - 3NT: your hand is balanced, no Major).

at|mitch:  Play:   On to the opening  lead.
Even though North bid hearts, East should lead the @HQ here.  
If she does, the defense wins 3 hearts and the  @SAce and declarer will almost surely fail.
When the bridge gods give you a 3-card honor sequence, they usually mean for you to lead it.

MM:  By clicking on the cards, you can play the hand Double Dummy,

at|mitche: Bidding:  Well, we wound up with a wild hand.
After 2@D overcall, I think North has a textbook 4@H bid.  She has 5 card support, a singleton in the overcalled suit, 
and plenty of shape.  
East may decide that her hand is worth 5@D over 4@H - or 4@D over the very cautious 
(some might say too cautious) 2@H bid.

up|24|pf|y|at|mitch:  Play:   Although the contract was 3@H, the only defense to beat 4@H, by the way, 
is for West to lead the @SA and shift to the @DJ
East wins the @DA and leads a second spade for W to ruff, 
Since declarer has just 2 discards on the spades, she will lose a club sooner or later, too.
And 5@D is just about cold!  It loses just 1 heart and the @CA, I think, because the @CJ is coming down in 2 rounds.
So when you have a big, big trump fit, do not be shy about bidding to the limit of your hand early.|
