^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Evaluating Your Hand - Part 3  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|^b@2^*BIn-and-Out-Valuation^*N
Today we will cover Evaluating your hand - part 3: In- and  Out- valuation. 

Recall: in prior lessons, we discussed these 3 points:
1. Other things being equal, honors are more valuable in your long suit than your short suit.
2. Other things being equal, honors in combination are worth more than isolated honors
3. Other things being equal, honors are more valuable in your long suit than your short suit.

We also mentioned the idea that honors in partner's suit were worth more than honors in suits we don't know anything about.
We are ready for the next (rather advanced) question: "are our outside honors working?"

Suppose partner opens 1@S.    Which hand is better for you to hold?
A: @sKxx  @hxxx  @dAxxx  @cxxx      or 
B: @sxxx  @hKxx  @dAxxx  @cxxx ?|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


at|

Clearly, we wish for hand A because the @SK solidifies partner's known suit (it is a "working card")

Hand A is likelier to be worth 2 tricks more than hand B, which needs either the @HA well-positioned or 
for partner to have a supporting @H honor.
Now, with that in mind, once again, partner opened 1@S and now you have
C: @SKxx, @hxxx, @dAxx, @cxxxx  or 
D: @sAxx, @hxxx, @dKxx, @cxxxx. 

Which hand do you think is better support?|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||cp|2|cs|3|at|^b@2
Hand C:
  
The high honor in spades is known to be a working card - pard bid spades; 
In Hand C (@SKxx, @hxxx, @dAxx, @cxxxx ) the @DA is also a working card, guaranteed to win a trick 
(barring weird distribution); 
but with  hand D (@sAxx, @hxxx, @dKxx, @cxxxx) the @DK is less sure to be a winner (it needs help somewhere). 
This is a very anti-intuitive idea. Let's look a bit more closely:
You're familiar with the term "quack". I will use the term "secondary honor" instead of "quack"

This leads to Principle 4 (In- and Out- Valuation): 
^*BIt is better to have your secondary honors in partner's suit(s) and your primary honors outside.^*N
Examples: After partner bids 1@S,  rank these hands in terms of strength for partner. 
(presumably, you are playing in a spade contract)

A: @sAKx, @hQxx, @dxxx, @cxxxx
B: @sKQx, @hAxx, @dxxx, @cxxxx 
C: @sAQx, @hKxx, @dxxx, @cxxxx|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at|

Strongest would be B, then C, then A. 

Here is why: 

Hand A: the Ace and King are both working, 
but the Q needs the most help from pard to be useful. 

Hand B: the @sKQ in pard's suit are working, and the @HA is a working card 
as long as pard is not void in hearts

Hand C: the @SAQ are both working, but the @HK needs support in pard's hand to be useful, 
but less help than @hQxx does.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||cp|2|cs|3|at|^b@2

So with that in mind, what do you bid after 1@S with each of these hands?

A: @sKxx, @hxx, @dQxxx, @cxxxx 
B: @sQxx, @hxx, @dKxxx, @cxxxx |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|

In both cases you probably want to bid 2@S.

Partner now bids 3@S, asking you to go on a maximum. 
Do you go on either hand?    Why or why not?|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|
kat827:  No, neither has a maximum. Would you actually bid 2@S on the first one?
mitche:  I agree. 
If you bid 2@S on the first one, that’s about a minimum. 
I wouldn’t even mind if you bid 1NT and then passed 2@S or corrected anything else to 2@S
With hand 2, you might be happier bidding 2@S directly, a more constructive bid than 1NT. 

Now, suppose LHO balances and RHO bids 4@H
1@s-pass-2@s-X
pass-4@h-??  
Which hand wants to defend, which one goes on?|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|

If you have to choose whether to defend or bid on, bid on with the hand that has better out-valuation (hand B)
(your offensive strength is greater) 
and pass with the hand that has better in-valuation (primary strength IN partner's suit) (hand A).
Because the top honor in your suit is not as good a defensive asset as it would be in a plain suit.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||cp|2|cs|3|at|^b@2

Back to example 2:

A: @sx  @hxxxx  @dAxxx  @cQxxx 
B: @sx  @hxxxx  @dQxxx  @cAxxx

This time, the auction was 
1@S - 1NT 
2@D - ??
 
What do you do with hand A
Pass or 3@D?  
Same for hand B: pass or raise?|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|

BILAsst10: pass
kat827:  3@D

mitche:  No one will object to passing both hands... 
BUT I would bid 3@D on hand B and pass on hand A.
Your raise with 2 working cards, one of them an ace, may be all pard needs to bid 3NT or look for a minor suit game.

Remember, a simple rebid (like 1@S - 1NT / 2@D) can be as much as 17 points.. 
so responder is forced to bid with as few as 8 support points. Or even a good 7.
2@D could be on a hand as strong as   @sAQJxx  @hKx  @dAKxx  @cxx
Now game is around 50%.. 
Change the @SQJ to the @HQ and @DJ, and you are odds on to make 5@D

So in summary: If your primary values are IN partner's suit and your secondary values are OUT, go conservative; 
But if your primary values are OUT and your secondary values are IN,  your hand's offensive strength is greater.

|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||cp|2|cs|3|at|^b@2

There is a convention called "Gazzilli", invented by an Italian (named "Gazzilli, would you believe??) 
to distinguish between minimum and stronger opening bids of 1@H or 1@S.
But that is pretty complex (has lots of conventional sequences), so we should save that until we get to 
the advanced classes.
dee_dee_20: Adopting Gazzilli, would it change the 2/1 structure dramatically?
mitche:  Using Gazzilli changes responses after 1@H - 1NT rather a bit. 
I would suggest you wait until you have more mastery of the basic ideas.
And also the more common conventions.

BILAsst10: Can one count distribution points in openers first bid suit?
mitche: You can count distribution, but best not to, until you have a fit!


BILAsst10: Have you introduced Walsh yet Mitch?
mitche: We can discuss Walsh style, which a lot of 2 over 1 players use; 
and a lot of them use up-the-line bidding.
I am not a zealot one way or the other.

nt||at|mitche:  Bidding: 2@S was fine, but S has a pretty big hand for passing -- I would bid 3@D with her hand.
West's hand is pretty fair, but it must not get carried away and bid 3@H - there's no guarantee of a fit.
N has no reason to disturb 2@S either.|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


at|
amcs:  Would east bid again over 3@D
mitche:  If S bid 3@D, then East should pass. 
dee_dee_20: if W bids 3@H, is that forcing?
mitche:  yes, had W bid 3@H over 2@S, most play that as 100% forcing. 
|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt||at|BILAsst10:  But 3@H over 3@D is not forcing?
mitche:  I would take 3@H as forcing over 3@D, too. 
Remember -- East's 2@S is designed to take bidding room from the opponents.
When you bid freely after partner's preempt, you are showing values.
The only non-forcing call West has is a spade bid. (well, 3NT, too... )
So if S bids 3@D it should end the auction.|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  An adventuresome N might bid something, but I doubt that 3@S shows a stopper .. It would ask for one.
(MM: "western style": Ops bid 1 suit: cuebidding their suit ASKS (or something else). 
Ops bid 2 suits: cuebidding TELLS)
After partner preempts, most people play "Raise Only Non-Force", aka RONF.
If you try to improve the contract on a misfit (say 3@h here), for example, you are playing 1 level higher 
and still have no assurance of a fit.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt||at|
Even if responder is void, you just take your lumps, because bidding on a misfit just gets you bigger lumps :)
Novella24:  The only option I would have if I had better value would be NT.
mitche:  Right, Novella - and without hearts, you are risking a big minus.

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: Let me say once again.   Don't lead an unsupported ace in a side suit against a trump contract.
And "unsupported" means "A without K".  With S's hand, I lead a small trump.|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


at|As it is, S continued the @D suit and declarer ruffed.
I would treat the Q as suit preference, saying "please lead a heart when you get in" -- suit preference signal. 
S has a large number of diamonds (5) from which to lead at trick 2.
She can communicate whether she likes hearts, clubs, or neither by the size of the @D she leads at trick 2. 
kat827:  When it is 50/50 that either P or declarer will ruff, as in this case, you shouldn't take a chance and continue the diamonds?
 |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Once the @DA was led, then S may as well continue the suit - she knows one person will ruff the  trick.  
N will get the story at trick 2, but I would have led the @DQ. 
(if pard is the one with the void, I would like her to ruff), 
Back to the defense:
After declarer wins the @CA at trick 3, she led small heart to the 10. N played the 6.|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  She should play the 8, giving count. 
If N plays the 8, S may decide that the hearts she cannot see are divided 2-2,  in which case it is safe to play small and win the second round of hearts.
Then declarer can never use hearts to get N to ruff. 
Finally, N must count trumps. In the end position, she will know that E was left with 3 trumps, 
the @sKJ and a small one.
So she could play small instead of the @SQ at trick 11, which would allow her to win 2 trumps instead of 1.|

S should start with a double, S's holds 19 pts - a hand too good to bid 1@S.
A simple overcall (like 1@S) should be at most 17 HCP or so. S has a hand that needs very little for game, 
like the @CQJ and 3 spades (or even 2, as we see here).
So S should X and W should bid 2@H.

But that is a pretty hard defense to find.. Most people would make 4@Ss as the cards lie.  
But what about 3@H - should it make?? |
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


at|
No, it should not. 
Where did the defense fall off the track? |
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


AT|
It happened at trick 1.  North knows from the lead of the Ace that south has a strong spade suit, including the @SK.
(if you aren't sure, read the earlier discussion for Board 1 on the lead of the @DA) :).|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So N should play high-low in spades to show an even number. 
And that number must be 2, because with 4 spades, she would have returned to spades, instead of passing 3@C.
Now, S can cash her 5 winners instead of trying to find N with a diamond honor
South should still work out that N has not got 3 spades (because with 3, she would once again have bid 3@S).
Anyway, East gave S a subtle push down the slippery slope with her play of the @SJ at trick 2.  
Nice false card, Eleanor :). |

That is a VERY common treatment in 2 over 1 AND in SA when you use Jacoby 2NT.
Here, if N does bid 3NT, S would bid 4@H and that would be that.
If S has a very slightly stronger hand (The J of either major, for instance),
she might start  control-bidding with 4@C, looking for a slam.|

at|mitche:  You would prefer to be in hearts because of the singleton @D.  Was 2@S a reverse??
It looks like one...BUT THIS IS A POINT FOR PARTNERSHIP DISCUSSION.
After a GF 2 over 1 response, you need to discuss whether you bid your hand pattern (2@S) or limit your hand strength (2@H)
I prefer the former, bid your pattern out, but that is not something cast in stone.
You need to discuss.

at|mitche: Bidding:  Wild hands are hard to bid. This is one such example
1@C looks correct with N hand, 
My preference with East's giraffe is to bid 2NT (unusual for 2 lower unbid suits).
East is not interested in defending, and the 2NT gets both red suits into play at once.
Some people play "good-bad" 2NT, but I think it more valuable to get into the auction on these distributional freaks.
After 1@H, South's 2@C is just competing.
2@C is not particularly strong, and he could have bid it without the @SK, for example.|

NT||
at|mitche:  To show a good hand with good support, it is common to make an immediate cue bid.
In this case, 2@H to say "limit raise or better" in opener's suit.
So I would bid 2@H with S's hand.
The important point is that 2@C isn't a very encouraging bid.|

rattray:  So how do you see the bidding going?
mitche:  After 3@D from East, South cannot catch up, and bidding 3@H sounds like a try to get to 3NT.
At this point it's better for S to bid 3@S, showing a stopper.|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  N can decide if he has the kind of hand that wants to be in 3NT,
but better to TELL where you have stuff here.
East bid 2 suits strongly, and N needs good stuff in both red suits, not just hearts.
If West realizes that East's hand has to be pretty strong, he/she might bid 4@H over 3@H.
East cannot have very many black-suit cards.|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Finally, if N bid 3@S over 3@H, S might just bid 5@C instead of 4,
Because: if N were on a bad hand, he/she would just bid 4@C...3@S shows extras.  |
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


at|
(I would bid 4@C on N hand, by the way, because those diamonds and spades look weak... )
BILAsst10: If E bids 2NT - what is Bob's bid - cue bid one of the promised suits? and which one?
mitche:  If E had bid 2NT instead of 1@H, I think S would have a problem.
His big club fit makes it hard to show limited strength.
Best would be to bid 3@C, I think, because the @HQ looks worthless, and he is aceless. |
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Also, 3@C leaves 3NT in play. 4@C makes it impossible to bid to NT -- most likely game.
Finally, if EW do find 5@C, I may take insurance with the E hand and bid 5@D or 5@H if West had raised the suit. 
E/W will get to 5@H (probably doubled and down just 1).

at|mitche:  Bidding: Earlier tonight someone said, "when you find yourself in a hole, stop digging".
The hole here was the misfit, and the first shovel was 2NT, 
A) West wanted to preempt in hearts. With 4 card support to the ace for opener's suit, don't preempt in your suit!
So I asked west to change his bid to 1@H.
The double by N (as a passed hand) was not unreasonable.
East might have tried 1@S instead of 2@C at her second turn.
We love majors and settle for minors only when there's no other alternative
|
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


NT||at|2 wee ones: Would a 1@S response be a reverse?
mitche:  A reverse is a non-jump rebid that is higher than 2 of opener's original suit
So 1@S is lower than 2@D, not a reverse.
mitche: North's double is takeout. 
N showed spades but we want to describe our hands accurately. 
It is possible that over 1@S, W could find 1NT, but 2@C almost guarantees that W will have to rebid hearts 
or raise diamonds (support them). |
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


NT||
at|mitche:  So bid 1@S. If you had a heart honor, you might try 1NT, but with your actual (east) hand, 1@S is right.
After 2@H, East should just give up. West advertises at least 6 hearts (and not really great ones, either)

up|52|pf|y|nt||at|mitche:  Play: Opening lead - think that S should lead a black suit - 
the @D actually gave the declarer a chance to make her contract!
If I were on lead, I would try the spade king, trusting partner to have that suit.
On the actual opening lead, East correctly ducked and North correctly shifted to a spade
When S won the @SK, he should continue spades (North promised spades, after all!)
The @D gave E a chance to make the contract by creating 2 dummy entries.
East played a heart, won - and now S has another chance to get out with a spade.
|
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  When S led another diamond. East MUST win the ace and dump the 7 from hand.  
(From this point the contract can be made. Drive out the last @h stop and you just created an entry to dummy
with the @d6 by dumping the 7 on the Ace)  
By ducking, any lead or subsequent shift sets the contract.


MM: By clicking on the cards, you can play the hand Double Dummy.
