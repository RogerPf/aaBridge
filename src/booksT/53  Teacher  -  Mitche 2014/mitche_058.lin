Also, make sure you have "widescreen" checked in your windows BBO-version
(If you're not sure about your settings log into your BBO windows version then:  
click the yellow tool at bottom and under the "general" tab check "widescreen" and save)
This will prevent the "cutting off" of the bottom parts or scrambling of your text in these presentations.

If you downloaded BBO recently, you will not be able to get online with the windows version...
You can still change or check your settings: 
Go to your C disc, and under "programs" find the Bridge Base Online folder
Open it and find the "profiles" folder
Open and scroll to find: BBO_Default_Settings 
line 71 should read: WIDE_CLIENT=1
If your setting is 0, change it to 1 and save.

fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, 
if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. 
We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. 
My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, 
so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving 
and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."


Mitch Edelman aka   "mitche"






MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.
Thank you Eileen (wyoming33) for sending the hands and editing the chatlog! @h

at|mitche: Bidding:  Note that if you are playing Walsh style or standard, the auction would be the same. 
South has enough strength to bid both of her suits, so she bids 1@d.  If North had bid 1NT, she would then bid 2@s 
(unless she is playing checkback Stayman, but that is another lesson :) ) 
As it is, the 3NT call was just right.
Well  bid!!  Why was 1@s not  4th suit forcing? |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||at|By almost every authority, if the auction starts 1@c – 1@d/ 1@h 
then 1@s is natural, and 2@s is treated as 4th suit forcing.  
Remember that the auction 1@c-1@d/1@h-1@s occurs very often!
realrowdy:  But don’t you need 5 to bid 2@s?
mitche: 2@s in this auction, 1@c – 1@d/ 1@h – 2@s is game-forcing, and artificial.. 4th suit forcing.   
You may or may not have spades.
It can be confusing. It also depends on the start of the auction.

at|mitche:  Play:  Leading a club here (the suit bid on opening leader's right) is a bad idea.  
We know that LHO has 4 spades.  If she had 5 spades and 4 diamonds, she would have responded 1@s and 
then 2@d -- right??   

And we know that declarer has at most 3 spades, so third hand has at least 3 spades.   
So I would guess to lead the @s8 here...then declarer loses 2 spades, 2 clubs.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt||
 
at|mitche:  Finally--declarer might try playing the @DK instead of small to the @dA at trick 11. 
This preserves the chance of catching the @DQ and making 11 tricks.

sk||
at|mitche: Bidding: 2@h would not be my first choice for bids (I'd pass), 
but it had a pretty devastating effect on what followed.
After 2@h, South's double is correct - support for everything else and enough values to force to the 3 level.  
What should North do after the X?  A bid of 2@s could be made with 0 points.   
I would bid 4@s with the North hand - South must have at least 14-15 support points for any suit North would name 
to double at unfavorable vulnerability.  |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So 14 + 11 (plus some more for the singleton) = game.  But North bid 2@s.
Now we can return to South hand, which is pretty decent-looking, with solid @s support and 16 working HCP, 
and the singleton @hK  
What should south do after 2@s? 
I think that 3@s is a standout bid.. It says "bid 4 if you have more than a minimum 2@s bid."  
A minimum might be 0-5 or 6. 
South should not jump to game because it could be very wrong if West has a couple of North's honors.|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt||
at|realrowdy:  If I say 3 does it not indicate monster?
mitche: It shows a pretty darned strong hand, because you are bidding to the 3-level opposite what could be 
a 2 point hand.  
Remember - you want to have at least 22 or so total points to bid to the 3-level in competition. 
South has 19 HCP (if you count the wasted @HK, or 19 pts if you count the singleton and quality outside suit).

at|mitche:  Bidding:  A couple of thoughts on 2@s.  
Although East has ideal shape for a Michaels 2@s bid, I don't like the idea here.  
You're forcing partner to the 3-level with the bid, and you could get your head handed to you.  
Here, 3@c and 3@h both fail by at least 1 trick, which is -200 doubled when N/S cannot make a game.
I suppose I agree with Bridge World contributor Carl Hudecek, who said: 
"Have your bid - and an extra Queen" when you overcall vulnerable.|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: Now, 2NT by West asked which minor East holds.
3@s seems natural.  
4@s is a bit pushy, but it really doesn’t need much from dummy.  At IMPS I bid 4@s all the time.

at|mitch:  Play:   There was just one thing I'd have done differently. 
When West returned the @h10 around trick 3, declarer went in with the @hK--He should play small. 
If East plays the @hA, then declarer can discard a losing @d on a winning heart 
(or discard a loser if West ruffs with her trump winner)   
East should not play the @hA on a low heart, but North did not give her a chance to make a mistake. 
As declarer or defender, sometimes you want to give your opponent a chance to make a mistake. |

at|mitche: Bidding:  Pretty normal.  South has a hand worth 15-16 dummy points, and I would not have objected 
to a 3@s bid... if South did bid 3@s then North should pass. 

His hand is not strong enough (and the singleton club no benefit) to accept the invitation. 
But 2@s is really OK here because South lacks aces.  So 2@s is my preferred bid from South.

at|mitche: Play: After the defense takes 3 heart tricks, West should probably get out with  a trump, 
rather than the thirteenth heart. 
Leading the thirteener gives a ruff-sluff to declarer, and it cannot promote a trump trick for the defense.
Sometimes leading into a triple void is a good idea, but usually only when declarer has no outside losers.  
Here declarer has a club loser, which could have gone away on the heart--and should have.  
If declarer discards a club, the hand cannot be defeated. |

|sk||
at|mitche: Bidding: I may have mentioned this before, so please forgive me if I am repeating myself. 
Responder should not pass an opening bid with an ace in his/her hand. 
Here, West should bid 1NT over 1@h. This will doubtless be passed by North, 
and East will bid 3@d, corrected to 3@h by West.  
East should probably bid 4@h over 3@h, and the contract should make (legitimately).|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


nt||at|gypsy1308: Wouldn't 2@h be a sensible bid here -- 5  HCP + doublton? 
mitche: Well, playing the style of 2 over 1 that I recommend, a raise to 2@h should be "constructive", 
showing between 7 - 9 HCP (or a real bad 10 count).   
Here, 1NT followed by 2 (or 3) hearts is how you show a really bad raise.  
And West has a pretty bad raise to 2.|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


nt||at|Here is the reason for this treatment:  
An opening 1@h bid can be 11 or 12 ratty points or 20 really good ones.  
When opener is somewhere in the middle (16-18) a 2@h raise gives opener headaches.   
If you are on the bottom of the 2@h raise range, even 3@h may be too much, 
but if you're on the top of it, passing may miss a cold game. 
So you bid 1NT first, to show a poor hand with (2) 3 hearts.

at|mitche: Bidding: After East passes, West’s hand is much too thin to double. 
The @hQJ are likely to be worthless, and West would not like a 3@d bid from East. 
Also, East is a passed hand, so West can reason that North has a good hand 
(pass + weak 2 + 9 HCP leaves a fair amount of strength for North). 
And finally, they call it "red" for a reason.. 
Unfavorable vulnerability is a very dangerous time to get frisky (red as in "bloodied").  
So West should pass.|

mitche:  What should North bid?  If N bids 3@h it is just competing.  
North might redouble, if that showed a good hand.  
3@d is the only other possibility, and if I were to bid, that would be my choice.
If S rebids 3@h, it won’t be a tragedy, since N has a couple of trump cards.|

at|BILAsst10: Looks like 3@h can be set.
mitche: It can be set.  It loses 1 spade, 2 clubs, 2 trumps.  So the auction should probably be:  
pass, 2@h, pass, pass/ and now East's flat hand and possibly useless @hK should convince him to pass again.

up|52|pf|y|at|mitch: Play: South found a good opening lead (the spade suit is frozen), 
and as long as the defenders leave spades alone, declarer will not make 3@c.
