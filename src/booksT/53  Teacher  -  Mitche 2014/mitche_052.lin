^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, 
if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. 
We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. 
My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, 
so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|^b@2^*bFourth Suit Forcing ^*N

Welcome to 2 over 1 bid, play, discuss.

Just a short note regarding Fourth Suit Forcing -
An artificial bid of the fourth suit, requiring partner to continue describing his/her hand thus conserving bidding space
to explore game or slam.  The bidder may or may not have a holding in the fourth suit, making the bid artificial and alertable.

While some players play Fourth Suit Forcing requires partner to bid only one round, 
many others play the convention as game-forcing.  
However, for most players the bid is game forcing when the fourth suit is made at the 3-level.

At the table, I suggest a vanilla 2 over 1 card with these conventions: Jacoby transfers, Jacoby 2NT, 
and your choice of limit raises or Bergen raises.


Ok let's play bridge!

MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.

at|mitche: Bidding: Someone mentioned bypassing 1@D -- NOT with this hand, which is good enough to reverse.
Some of you may be familiar with "Walsh-style" bidding...  
The idea is that if you have a weak (less than game-forcing) hand with a 4-card major, and a 4-card @D suit, 
you skip the @D suit.           Example:  @sxx, @HKJxx, @dKxxx, @cQxx 
You bid 1@H over 1@C because the hand is not good enough to force to game.  
Here, West has a very solid 5-card suit and also GF values after East opens.  
So rather than distort the bidding, I would respond  1@D  to  1@C|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  East will rebid 1NT 
- If West has a Major and a weak hand, there is no reason for East to reveal his spade suit,
and if West has a good hand with spades, East will hear about it later.
If East bids 1NT, then W would be strong enough to bid 2@H here.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||at|So here is the rule on Walsh-style bypassing 1@D: 
If your hand has 4-4 in a Major and @D's, bid your Major if you have at most 10-11 points.  
If you have 5 diamonds, bypass the diamond suit only if you are prepared to stop at the 2 or 3-level:
over a minimum (or invitational) opener.

This is true even if you are a dedicated Walshite.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||at|Now, after West's FSF (4th suit forcing), East's 2NT bid was also not the book bid.  
Suppose the auction is  1@C – 1@H / 1@S (or 1NT) - 2@D, as we had here.
Opener's priorities are as follows:
First - if you have 3-card support for responder's Major, show it. 
Second, if you have an unbid Major that you can show, show it.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Example : 1@C – 1@S/ 1NT - 2@D.. bid 2@H if you have 4 of them and not 4 spades.
Lagunatic:  I had 3 @H's and you said bid 2@H supporting pard's major.....is this forcing?
mitche:  Well, the 4th suit forcing is a 1-round force, so technically, no. But responder would have to be
rock-bottom minimum to pass.

So for all intents and purposes I play it as forcing to the 3-level, and before I get a bunch of mail,
most pairs play FSF as game forcing.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Discuss if it's forcing to game (which with no discussion I would assume it is) or just to the 3-level. 
And as long as I’m thinking of it, the only GF bid by opener after a 1 over 1 response is a jump-shift.
BILAsst10: So recommended bidding here is?
mitche:  1@C - 1@D/ 1NT - 2@H/ 2NT – 3NT

In 2 over 1 auctions,  there are just 6 auctions that start 2 over 1 GF : 1@S – 2@C. 1@S – 2@D, 1@S - 2@H,
1@H – 2@C, 1@H – 2@D and 1@D – 2@C.
That's it on 2 over 1 GF starts... There are other GF auctions, but the 6 I listed are for 2/1 GF auctions.

sk||
at|mitche:  Bidding:  A simple overcall, as 1@S was, usually shows a maximum of 17 HCP.
South has 17 HCP, but she should probably double and then bid 1@S over 1@H because this hand is better than
your run of the mill 17 point hand.  It is a very muscular hand, with a spade suit buttressed with good
intermediates, the @CK probably favorably placed.  Had S overcalled 1NT, it would also be OK, depending
on your style. 

elmo1123:  another option...which was the best?|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Mine (here I go again, pretending I have style :) ) is to bid 1NT because it gets the essential
strength and shape across in 1 bid  and  pard will be encouraged to bid with hands that would pass 1@S.
So I am more likely to find game with a 1NT overcall than 1@S.
Also, since I play "systems on" with 1NT overcalls, I will still get to show spades if pard moves over 1NT.

W and N properly passed, and now we come back to the balancing bid of 1NT.
I think the 1NT balance is about a king and a queen light.  I play the balancing bid should be more
than a flat 13, with only 1 1/2 quick tricks.|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  If I bid over 1@S (and I would probably not, unless I felt very lucky), I would reopen with 2@C,
and I would make sure my hospital insurance was paid up.
Sometimes, you just gotta shut up (I need to learn that lesson, too) and pass.
Balancing = taking some action in the pass-out seat, especially when the auction is going to end at a low level
if you do pass.
Here, E knows that her spade honors sit "in front of" the spade bidder, and they are vulnerable to being finessed -- so they aren’t going to be very useful on offense.   Another reason to go quietly.

at|mitche: Play:  It is kind of double-dummy, but a club lead will probably hold declarer to 4 tricks. 
No one is going to lead a club here, so the question is "which spade to lead?

I would lead a LOW spade, just in case declarer has @sQJxx or even worse for the defense, @sQJ9xxx. 
You want to lead low for 2 reasons: 
If pard ever gets in, you may be able to pick up the 4 tricks when declarer has 4 of them, and 
occasionally, pard will have a singleton honor.|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  N/S did well not to allow declarer a second @D trick.  How'd they know?
North played low @D (count) on first trick.
So South knew that declarer has 3 of them, and holding off on the second round of diamonds isolates the @DJ.
Btw, declarer should attack diamonds before releasing the @CA from dummy. |

at|mitch:  Play:  In 2@S, declarer counts 6 possible losers - 2 clubs 2 diamonds and possibly 2 trumps. 
(I simplified by counting North's cover cards for heart and spade losers).
So how should she plan to play?
One strategy is to hope to ruff diamonds.  Another is to hope for just 1 club loser.
The club spots are good enough that declarer can hope for 1 club loser - finesse the suit twice!
If East holds any one club picture, declarer has 3 clubs.  So I would win the @CA (East's play of
diamonds shows a doubleton), finesse the @SJ,  play the @SA, and then plan to finesse the clubs.|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  I win 3 trumps, 3 clubs, and the defense set up my 2 diamonds.

at|mitche:  Bidding:  With 5-4 in the majors, there is a strong pull for W to look for a major - suit fit.
On the other side it is a 7-point hand, which means that game is not likely.
So she mentally flipped a coin and decided to pass.

Here is where luck plays a part. 
If she bids stayman, then E/W play 3 or 4 spades.
If she passes they play 1NT, which won’t score as well (at matchpoints, anyway).|
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: At IMPS, there is little difference in score so she is probably right to pass 1NT
note that if E/W stumble into 4@S, it will go down rather easily, so E/W guessed well.

at|mitche:  Bidding:  I think that a raise of 1NT to 2NT shows a balanced hand, 5332 shape, and 18-19 HCP,
after you open 1@s.
East has the strength, but not the shape for 2NT, and I would bid 3@C to announce the hand's strength
and shape.

Also, the weak holding in the red suits would make me less likely to bid NT on my own.
After 2NT, W bid 3@H, showing a weak hand with long hearts. That bid shows 6 hearts, 6 points and out.|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  (I would hope for better heart intermediates, by the way).  So East has 2 calls available
to him, pass, or 4@H.
If I trust pard to have what the bid promises, I would raise to 4@H - my known 8 card fit.
Note that 4@H is making with the aid of the @S finesse.  Or even better, with the aid of a club discard :)

My good friend and world-champion player Ricardo Poleschi makes the point this way:
"Aces and kings score in any contract, but long suits like to be trump"
remember it when you play-- long weak suits opposite balanced strength like to be in trump-contracts.

That is as discouraging a card as she could play.
I think that given the bidding, N would like a diamond continuation.
So she should encourage with the 7 spot, the highest card she could spare.
And if S does shift (following North's strong suggestion), what should she shift to?|

at|mitche:  Looking only at dummy and her hand, S would probably shift to the @HA and another heart.
Why?
East's 2NT bid would not be made on a singleton heart
So N has at most 1 heart and she can trump the heart continuation
You have to remember the bidding and see if it gives you any clues to the way the cards are distributed.|

at|mitche:  My guideline for defense: 
First, try to build a picture of the declarer's and dummy's hands based on the bidding.
Did someone promise a long suit? 
Did someone not support a suit that got rebid?

Do I have length in a suit? Are there bad breaks in store for declarer??
Try to form that picture before you lead, and then use it to plan the defense.
After the opening lead, adjust the picture!|

nt||
at|mitche:  You may find it tough when you start thinking that way, but you will get better by looking at the hand records and checking out the hands against your preliminary picture.
And above all, as defender, you have to practice counting.

MM:  By clicking on the cards, you can play the hand Double Dummy,

at|mitche:  Bidding:  At unfavorable vulnerability, West was deterred from a takeout double of 2@H, I think.
But I would do it anyway, because I am not going to do well defending 2@H, and I don’t know if 4th hand
would balance (he should do it with heart shortness).  

I am not fond of selling out to weak 2'S when I have a NT opening bid.  If I don’t have a heart stopper,
I double.  And if I do have one, I bid 2NT.
Preempts are very annoying when I have a good hand.|
pg| ***** 108 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Depends on scoring and hand quality, but if RHO opens weak 2 in first seat, I am going to be in.
If my partner is a passed hand, I am less likely to get in. 

So had the auction gone pass, 2@H to your hand, I would shut up and hope pard could reopen the bidding
does that help, BilAsst10?
BILAsst10: That’s what happened here.  I hated to pass but I couldn’t see doubling with my hand.|
pg| ***** 109 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  I understand, but "less likely" is not "never" and I like my good support for anything pard
could bid...
In any event, it's pretty close whether you bid or pass. I am very aggressive over weak 2's. 
But then again, I have a reputation for good declarer play (I steal a lot)
BILAsst10: more than I am  - with 1 less @H's I would be more inclined.
mitche:  Yes, but you can’t have everything :)

at|mitch:  Play:  On the third round of hearts, East has a discard problem. He has to ditch a small
spade or club.  A diamond is not going to work because declarer can get to dummy twice in clubs to
ruff a diamond and then cash the 4th one.  When declarer discarded the small club on the third heart,
you know that you can, too.

MM: You can play the hand Double Dummy if you wish
This concludes this presentation, I hope you enjoyed, Karen10 & GG_Bridge |
