fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department).  Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue 
(who loves puttering with the plants in the back yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.  Mitch is also an avid 
amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.  Mitch is currently an active bridge player, and joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team 
February 24, 2010.  His "Play and Discuss 2/1" sessions are most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player.

"When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."
Mitch Edelman aka mitche 


MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.
Thank you Eileen (wyoming33) for sending the hands and editing the chatlog! @h

at|mitche:  Bidding:  East has a pretty good hand, and the X is a good way to start it. 
She is too strong for 1@S, and double allows West to contribute her thoughts about what might be a decent trump suit.
South has a pretty poor hand, but he does have 5 clubs.

So even if North has just 3 clubs for her 1@C opener, South has a singleton spade and a big fit. 
I would not hesitate to bid 3@c over the double with this hand. Remember 1@C X 3@c is preemptive. 
Opener won’t expect very much from responder.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  What do you think West would do over 3@C instead of 2?
There is a pretty fair chance that West would pass 3@C, as her hand is also rather weak.
BILAsst10: I have a very weak hand and really struggled to bid 2.
mitche:  Yes, 2@s may have also been a bit of an overbid :)   .. 3@S would certainly have been one. 
Count losers. West has 9 losers, and a double promises about 8 losers, 
so that means that unless East has significant extras, 3@S rates to be down 1 or 2.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  We would not like to risk down 2 (and maybe doubled) against a partscore. 
That's why preempts work.  East will reopen with something, probably another X.. 
(and pray that West does not bid @D's).  
And E/W may wind up in 3@s, not 4.

at|mitche:  Play:  Declarer lost 2 diamonds and then won the heart, played 2 rounds of spades and finessed in clubs 
to make the contract.
Can anyone see a better line of play?
Here is a better idea:  
After the @DAK are played, win the @HA, then the first trump IN HAND, and ruff a diamond   (high)
If the @DQ happens to fall tripleton, then the club finesse becomes unnecessary.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt||
at|BILAsst10: Makes the @dJack good.
mitche: If you can find a safe way to avoid staking the contract on a finesse, do it. 
Finesses are notoriously unreliable.

pg| ***** 25 ***** |


sk||
at|mitche:  Bidding:  I am not fond of 1NT by East after the neg X.  Partner's most likely bid over 1NT is pass, 
and 1NT would be a disaster if West overcalled without the @SAK.  
If East bids 1NT, she should have pretty nearly an opening hand, and probably a doubleton heart,
just in case you need to park the contract in a suit.  

Also West's pass over 2@C was very conservative.  If East can find 1NT here, 
and I have 16 very good points, I would probably have bid 3NT with her cards.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Someone asked about the 1@c opener. 
South has 9 HCP, and 9 cards in his 2 longest suits.    That's 18, with 2 quick tricks  (QT). 
This is short of being either a Bergen 20 or an Edelman 22 (= rule of 20 opener and 2 QT's), 
so I would pass it --  especially vulnerable.
BILAsst10: Of course 3NT is down right away.
mitche:  True, which is why East should not bid 1NT.

at|mitche:  Play:  Declarer has 6 club tricks and the @DAce. And no hope for another trick. And no chance of fewer.
I liked the @D7 discard, asking pard to shift to that suit.
Without that shift, defense left declarer with 1 chance to make the contract.
What was it?|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


at|
Playing a second spade toward dummy to establish the @SQ before the @D gets established.
Which is why,  you want to shift to a @D right away!!|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  It is hard to see that, but the general principle is: where can declarer get rid of @d losers? 
There's no suit in dummy that can absorb any diamond losers declarer has. (except for the @sQ)
Believe me, folks, I lost a lot of matchpoints before I learned that lesson. 
Don’t try to set up dummy's long  suit for declarer!

at|mitche:  Bidding:  East has a weak hand, 3 Queens (one of them singleton doesn't look very robust, even after a reverse).
There is a tool, the "Wolff signoff" that allows you to get out at the 3 level with a bad hand.
Basically, bid 2NT after the reverse.
Opener will bid 3@c (conventionally) and responder can then make a weak raise to 3@d or 3@s.
This is NOT the kind of stuff that  you play casually, so you MUST have both an established partnership AND 
a long discussion on the convention.|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


nt||
at|BILAsst10: Sort of like Lebensohl.
mitche:  Yes, very much like Lebensohl.
Anyway, without that convention, East bids 3@s and West should probably bid 4@c (cue bid).
BILAsst10: So here - what should I do bid 4@S or 4@c or pass 3@S?
mitche:  After 3@s, bid 4@C. Most people play that raising the reverse suit is GF. So 3@s commits you to game.
Partner will bid 4@s and you know you are off both the @DK and a heart control, making slam at best a 50-50 shot.
West has a 4 loser hand, so I would not open 2@c with it, even though it is a very nice hand. 
|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  After 3@s, 4@c is a control bid, saying "I have first or second round control of clubs"
BILAsst10: oh ok - looking for slam.
mitche:  Marty Bergen, in "Slam Bidding made Easy" (I never did like that title) describes "Italian" control bids. 
The basic idea: If you are in a GF auction and have agreed on a trump suit, a bid of a new suit BELOW game shows 
first or second round control (A, K, or shortness).  And a control bid ABOVE game shows the A or a void.
Controls are shown "up the line", and if you bypass a suit, you deny a control in it.|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So after 4@c by West (our hypothetical bid over 3@s), East has no red-suit controls to bid,  
so she just bids 4@s and that's that. 
West is not tempted (well, not as tempted, anyway) to go on and you stop in a safe 4@s.|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


at|
jonnyquest:  2@S = Jump-Shift . . . so GF established then, yes?
mitche:  That is a matter of partnership agreement. 
In SA, it was treated as GF, and most pairs do play it that way. |
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  However, some (if they have a way to show a very weak responder hand - think "wolff signoff" for example) 
may be able to get out below game.

I think it's best for now just to treat a jump shift as game forcing.   
And certainly, West's hand with 4 losers is GF after responder can scrape up a bid.

at|mitch:  Play:  North led the unbid suit, and I have no problem with the 9 to show no club honor.
Declarer then guessed to play the @SAK and luckily guessed the trump position.

At this point, her best line is to use trumps to get to dummy twice and take 2 @D-finesses.
If she is lucky, the @DK will be onside, and the suit will have split 3-2.
She then wins 4 spades, 3 clubs, and 5 diamonds.|

at|mitche: Bidding: This is a pretty difficult hand to bid well.
After 1@c, 1@s is clearly right (2@s and 3@s are weak, and I think 4@s is just too awful for words).
I would not give any thought to any bid other than 1@S.
North has a fair hand, and while the @CK may be poorly situated, it's still a value, so 2@d (nonforcing and constructive)
seems the right value bid with North hand.
East does best to pass, which she did.|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: South has a problem now. The @DK has become a valuable card, and the 7 good spades. 
Well, they still look like trumps.
So I might have bid 3@s instead of 2.
North has not got any more than she promised, 
the hearts and clubs are still weak, and the spade support isn't all that hot, either - so she should pass 3@s.
What would North need to bid 4@S?  A second spade and club doubleton would be enough.

at|mitche:  Play:  West led the @C7, third best.  I prefer to lead 4th best here as a standard lead. 
If East reads the lead as being from an honor, she might consider ducking, but that would be wrong here.
 
East can see that the diamond suit is working for declarer. 
The @DK is missing, and East knows it's either in declarer's hand or its finessable.
So climbing with the @CA and cashing 2 hearts (if they cash) is best defense.
The @SK will be a trick, and declarer cannot then take more than 9 tricks. 
|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: Here, the only way North doesn’t have an entry to dummy is if she is void in @D.
By the way, remember when I chastised West for helping to set up dummy’s suit?
Here the situation is different.  
The threat is that declarer will pick up a couple of discards on the diamond suit, 
so she does best to cash those winners before the mice get to them.|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: The threat of heart (or club) losers vanishing on the diamond suit is very real, 
so the defender has to ignore the rule of thumb to hold off on the Ace of clubs here.
Litc:  Understood, but assuming that we are in 3@S, the only foreseeable way to set the contract is 
by picking up 2 club tricks -- in other words playing for 3 or 5 tricks.
mitche:  If dummy doesn’t have a viable source of tricks, then East should not fly with the ace.
I understand your point, but East may be looking at a situation where declarer will ditch losers on diamonds.|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: In this spade partial, the overtricks aren’t all that important, but defending correctly is.. 
and here is one of those situations where we have to go against the conventional rule of 
"waiting to capture an honor with the Ace".

North correctly bid 1@S over 1@d, but over 1NT, she has an awkward hand.

at|mitche: North should NOT bid 3@c over 1@d because she has 4 spades and more than 5 points.
In the auction 1@D - 1@S/ 1NT - 3@c is pretty much the North hand. 
BUT 1@D - 1@S/ 1NT - 2@c/2@d - 3@c in Standard is a game-forcing (almost slam invitational) hand.|
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  The treatment that Steve recommends is in his book, Washington Standard, (which is also "east coast 2 over 1”).
If North bids 2@c, even as a passed hand, it asks opener to show 3-card @s-support and promises almost an opening hand.

On this misfit, that isn't the case, so North should not punish South by showing almost an opening bid.
I would still use that same treatment.  1@d-1@s/1NT-3@c
Caution - not everyone plays 3@C as I describe it here. |
pg| ***** 94 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Use ONLY with established partnerships.
Here, since North is a passed hand, South is not likely to get carried away with 2@c followed by 3@c.
As it happens 3@c makes rather easily. |

at|mitche:  Bidding:  How many losers does North have in support of spades?
calligal: 9
mitche:  Right - so even with 9 HCP, this hand is worth just a 2@s raise.
Now, after a raise, what is South's hand worth?
gypsy1308: 16
mitche:  That is also about right.|
pg| ***** 112 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Using Bergen evaluation, she has 12 HCP + 1 for quality South suit + 1 for the 6th spade + 2 for the 
singleton. (Also 1 for the 4-card side suit I think.)
That is enough to invite game.  Some will add 3 points for 5th and 6th spade. 
In any case, South has an invitational hand.
We agree that despite 12 HCP, the hand is really a lot stronger than its point count.  (5-loser hand after support)
And North has enough to accept the invitation (3@s) with a maximum for his 2@s bid.
So N/S should find 4@s.|
pg| ***** 113 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  West decided to pass 1@s -- I agree that a double would be OK here, since the points are concentrated outside 
of spades, the hand has 2 1/2 quick tricks, and adequate support for anything East might bid.
If West does double, what should North do?|
pg| ***** 114 ***** |


at|
Here's the problem: 2@s is a weak bid.
And North is not weak. You'd bid 2@s on something like @sQxx, @hKxx, @dxx, @cxxxxx.
3@s is weak, and shows a 4-card support....|
pg| ***** 115 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Marty Bergen invented something for this situation: 
I think you'll find it in Bergen's  "bid better play better" book.
         1@s - X - 2@s  shows a weak raise with 3-card support.
Bergen suggests that 2@c in this auction -
         1@S - X - 2@c   shows 7-9 HCP and 3-card support.
And also - 
         1@S - X - 2@d    shows 7-9 HCP and 4-card support.|
pg| ***** 116 ***** |


nt||
at|BILAsst10: This is Marty's treatment and I haven't seen anyone else use it — at least Lawrence doesn’t.
mitche:  Well, actually it is part of the Bergen Raise convention, he referred to it as BROMAD -- 
Bergen Raise of Major After Double|
pg| ***** 117 ***** |


at|
Litc:  Wouldn't a redouble work well in this case as well?  North does have a fairly decent hand.
He can still raise spades afterwards.
mitche:  A redouble should be 10+ HCP and some use it to show poor fit for opener's Major.|
pg| ***** 118 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  With 10+ HCP and good support they use Jordan 2NT     1@S - X - 2NT.
The point here is to know what your agreements are over a double.
I advocate this treatment:     Jordan 2NT  
- a new suit at the 1-level is forcing (essentially ignore the X with 8+ points) and 
- a new suit at 2-level is non-forcing and not constructive, either.
- Redouble and spade raise generally shows 10+ and 3-card support.
-  1S - X - 2NT = 10+ and 4-card support   (rarely Hxx, where H = A, K, or Q)|

In a casual partnership, whatever you decide is fine. 
But if you ever play any duplicate or have an established partnership or are playing with advanced-expert partners, 
they will expect you to use Bromad.

at|mitche: Play: One comment on play ... declarer might want to ruff 2 diamonds in dummy. 
Her trumps are good enough to allow her to ruff the 3rd and 4th diamonds high. 
That allows her to make 11 tricks.
Thanks to Eileen for her generous assistance and to all of you for your courteous attention and participation.

MM: You can play the hand Double Dummy if you wish
This concludes this presentation, hope you enjoyed, Karen10 & GG_Bridge|
