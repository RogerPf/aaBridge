^d @H@2Lioncub’s bidding session is held every Friday in the BIL at noon NY time. 3 Hands @e@3are bid with 4 volunteers and then change. Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play…….or both. Feel free to ask any questions that are bridge related.

^d @H@2What  :|CP||AT| For my later review I like to have a BBO movie representing lioncub's teaching session as close @e@3to the live event as possible. I am delighted that you can also enjoy it.|cp|8|at| 

How  :|CP||AT| In this presentation I have combined the hands from lioncub's Friday Teaching Sessions with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed and edited from the chat. He has approved the bridge information in this movie. You will see the four hands and the auction by the participants and after Allan has asked for a "Lead and Claim." The claim is meaningless and is made so his critique can begin. |cp|8|at| 

Goal :|CP||AT| The emphasis is to present lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  Incorrect grammar and spelling are tolerated. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. All the links in this file are clickable - they turn color when you move your cursor over them.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site. |FP|2|AT|

The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at|^*B HELP^*N |cp||FP|2|at|box at the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section. |FP||CP|8|AT|
 

Please help me improve these movies by sending suggestions to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.|CP||FP||AT|

                                               
                                              Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

^B@2Now, assume that you are sitting South. Review your hand and decide what bid you would have made if you actually were there. Write it down and click the forward arrow. You may find that your bid may be different from the player in time. Continue until the auction is over and there is a lead and claim. Then you will see all four hands. The claim is immaterial and is done so Allan can start his critique and recommendations. Then you can compare your bidding with his recommendations. It is as good as being there. Don't forget that unlike the actual player you would be playing all the boards. Good Luck.|mb|2S|mb|d|

^B@2lioncub: Spade lead is best.  Now  then,  my rules for opening weak 2 bids are:
1. 6-9 points with suit no worse than headed by KJ9
2. No good defensive tricks 
3. You deny having 3 cards to an honour in the other major. North hands fails on the third condition.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


NT|
^B@2lioncub: As you can see here this is why we have that rule.............partner will never know you have 4 hearts. These rules are for 1st and 2nd seat...........in 3rd seat allow more leeway. Now, lets go back to the bidding as it was. Over 2@S, the rule here is that you MUST be strong to bid over a weak 2...........at least a sound opening hand. Here East has just 14HCP with that worthless Q@S. Next, if you double you guarantee to hold 4 cards in the other major. So the only bid possible with E hand is pass. South should not consider any bid. Again on the bidding as it went W should bid 5@D............not 4.|

^B@2lioncub: Lead is as good as anything. North, what has South has told you by his two bids? He has shown 5 spades and invitational hand. Soooooooooooo over the 2NT North should:
With min hand and 2 spades..............pass
With min hand and 3 spades..........sign off in 3@S
With maximum bid 4@S with 3 cards in spades.......and bid 3NT with only 2. Therefore, here the bid over 2NT should have been 4@S. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|
^B@2lioncub: Please note that the 2NT is a demand...............for partner to bid game in spades with any 3 card holding. It is NOT asking him to use his judgement. Very instructive hand.|

^B@2lioncub: Lead is fine. Please note the system we play here...........BID ALL 4-CARD SUITS UP THE LINE. This is for the simple reason of finding a fit at the one level if possible. My bidding: 
1@D-1@H
3@D-3NT
When partner bids 3@D he has denied 4 hearts or 4 spades..............so no fit has been missed. Big tip...........if no fit sign off in lowest contract. 3NT is the limit of the hand.|

^B@2lioncub: Never lead singleton trump. Heart is best of a bad bunch. I repeat..........BID ALL 4-CARD SUITS UP THE LINE........more important to show that 4-card major than repeat 6-card minor. My bidding:
1@C-1@H
1@S-3@S
pass.       
3@S is the limit of the hands. |

^B@2lioncub: Correct lead. Correct opening bid  as is the double. Exactly what he shows with the double.........sound opening bid and 4 cards in other major and shortage in hearts. S also correct to pass. 2@S bid by West here is weak and shows 0 to 7 points. Instead, W.... must say to herself...........partner has shown 14+ with 4 spades. Her hand is worth 8 plus 1 point for distribution...........therefore invite with 3 spades. This is sooooooooooooooooooo important. Now the E hand can bid game. |
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT|
^B@2lioncub: Would you like to learn Lebensohl over weak 2s? Partner has doubled the opening 2 bid. To show more than 7............you bid 2NT..........this is artificial bid demanding partner to bid over 2NT. And now any bid you make would show 7+. Note also over 2@S doubled.............3@C and 3@D also show 0 to 7. You show 7+ by bidding 2NT and then bidding over partner's 3@C forced response. Bidding with Lebensohl assuming NS no longer bid would be
X-2NT
3@C-3@S
4@S   For more information see my site at ^*Hwww.zyworld.com/lioncub/Lebensohl.htm^*N.|

^B@2lioncub: Right lead. This is what is known in the trade as a LOL hand. 1@D-1@H-? Now let us go through the options for E 
2@D............no partner may have just 3. 
2@C?..............no would show shapely hand with 5 clubs.
Double is also wrong as it would show shortage in hearts and guarantee 4 spades
1NT?.............no does not have heart stop. However, without the interfering 1@H bid............1NT would be correct. So what then? surely a pass can't be correct with 9 good points? |
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT|
^B@2The answer is YES...........PASS is the only bid available that makes any sense. S should definitely support hearts especially with that singleton. The opening bid  should have been 1@C...........then an easy 2@C bid for E. My bidding ............if I can work it out:
1@C-1@H-2@C-2@H
p-p-p.......

^B@2lioncub: 4@S lead was correct. The 1@S bid was a huge gamble. N and particularly S are unlimited and the suit is far too poor in quality.  Do remember this............particularly vulnerable........one off doubled is 200 which is more than they can get for any part score.  Bidding was fine otherwise..........well done NS. |

^B@2lioncub: Correct lead. Playing Cappeletti, the N hand should bid 2@C..........showing unknown 6-card suit. Partner is forced to respond 2@D........as a relay and N would then bid her 6card suit. 2@S bid as shown here.........shows 5 spades and 4/5 of a minor. Also.............recommend you all play negative doubles here. A double by E would show shortage in spades .........but unable to show both minors. However, I don't open 1NT with 5/4 and maximum points. My bidding would be:
1@D-3@S-5@D-?  |
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT|
^B@23@S overcall shows 7 card suit. E does not know who the hand belongs to ......but follows the principle of bidding to the limit and make it difficult for opps to judge. East should do a hand evaluation. Diamonds are the agreed suit. Add points for shape..............3 for the singleton and 1 for the doubleton =13 points. Thus, my recommended bid is 5@D. Note if EW are in 6 they would make it by taking a heart finesse to ditch the losing spade.|

^B@2lioncub: Noooooooooooooo. A trump lead is  mandatory on the bidding.
lioncub: claim please
lioncub: 1@D-1@S-?  South, please remember you are not forced to bid. You do not have a good bid. There is no fit with partner...........this is always the danger sign. Pass again is the only bid that makes sense. As the bidding went E came in again with 2@C which should have been doubled. But quite right to double 2@S.
