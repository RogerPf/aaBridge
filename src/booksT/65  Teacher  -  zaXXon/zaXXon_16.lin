MM: The recommended screen resolution for .lin movies is 1440 x 900 pixels 
(rightclick on your desktop,select "personalize" "screen defenitions")
Also, make sure you have "widescreen" checked in your windows BBO-version
(If you're not sure about your settings log into your BBO windows version then:  
click the yellow tool at bottom and under the "general" tab check "widescreen" and save)
This will prevent the "cutting off" of the bottom parts or scrambling of your text in these presentations.

If you downloaded BBO recently, you will not be able to get online with the windows version...
You can still change or check your settings: 
Go to your C disc, and under "programs" find the Bridge Base Online folder
Open it and find the "profiles" folder
Open and scroll to find: BBO_Default_Settings 
line 71 should read: WIDE_CLIENT=1
If your setting is 0, change it to 1 and save. This will change your settings to "widescreen".

As an ALTERNATIVE: Open your aaBridge program and simply drag and drop the file of this presentation 
on the aaBridge screen.

^b@2zaXXon:  Hello friends, welcome everyone

We will continue today our walk in defender's shoes. 
I know it's hard...
If you remember our declarer discussions, 
we have tried many times to place the missing high-cards between the opponents, 
thus planning the play in a better way.
So, the same applies to defense's business as well.      But!|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


at|

Most times, the declarer will have a much better hand than our partner has. 
Thus, constructing declarer’s hand may not be easy.
For example – picturing a strong NT hand from 21 missing HCP's is not an easy job.
It looks much easier to arrange/picture partner's hand, having 5-6 points. 
Let us see how



MM: @d@dMany thanks to David (Major_blue) for saving the hands and editing the chat for this presentation!@d@d

at|zaXXon: We have a good suit to make a simple overcall at the 1-level
and the left opponent (LHO) closes the bidding abruptly.

The dummy startles us with a long and good @C-suit

pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||lb|*cWhich spade should you play?^^sa^sajt96|at|zaXXon: It seems very likely we can credit declarer with 2 spade stops for that jump to 3NT.
Partner has  5-6 points.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|
If we count declarer for 2 @S-tricks, 6 @C's from dummy (very likely, if declarer has honors in all suits)
AND the @hAce   ...      9 tricks seem ready to be taken!|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||at|If we duck the @sAce, he only has 1 spade to take readily
But if he has a heart honor in hand (which is 100%), again 9 + then you can’t knock out that entry from dummy.
=> clubs could even be played from the top if declarer does not hold the @cQ |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|
Do you think we may beat the contract somehow (and this should happen without delay)?
We need 4 more tricks.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||at|Holden47: We have to hope p has some diamonds
zaXXon: Yes, these 5 tricks can be found...in diamonds only.
If partner has the @CQ protected, even better - but losing time now to hold up the @SA is not good!|

It might not have been so, but one thing we know 
- the spade horse is lame and the @H suit does not look promising either.
So our hopes went to @D's naturally|

West’s 1NT bid indicates a weak @H holding by your partner.

but we know partner could have 3-4 points at best.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


at|
West accepted the game invitation, more likely he has 17.
We may be sure declarer has 2 stops, the  @HKJ most likely
=> We need to find a suit to cash some tricks|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


pc|HA|pc|H4|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: Imagine some high cards in our partner's hand and check if it is likely to bring us 5 tricks
@CK - badly placed if partner has it
@DK - may hope, but we have 2 @D's only
@SK - now this could help us get quick tricks. 
So, we take and shift in @S's|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt||lb|*cWhich spade should you lead now?^^sj^SAJ94|
pc|SJ|pc|SQ|pc|SK|pc|S2|at|zaXXon: And we should lead the J!
With the J we try to either force the Q (or the J holds if declarer ducks)
This @S10 in dummy is an ugly card and we should care to finesse it|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


hc|sas9|
at|
with the  @sA9
thus, we shifted with @SJ - and close an eye, west covered the J with the Q
and all we need is  @SKxx from partner  (as that would give  @sQxx to declarer)

up|16|pf|y|at|zaXXon: Well, may be the @SJ is not a very natural move...
But, if we look for a card to beat the contract and we believe this card is the @SK, then leading the Jack is correct.
If we return a small @S, declarer plays small too and he then has a stopper.
We hope to take all 4 tricks in the spade suit.|
