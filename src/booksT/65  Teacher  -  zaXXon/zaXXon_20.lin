MM: The recommended screen resolution for .lin movies is 1440 x 900 pixels 
(rightclick on your desktop,select "personalize" "screen definitions")
Also, make sure you have "widescreen" checked in your windows BBO-version
(If you're not sure about your settings log into your BBO windows version then:  
click the yellow tool at bottom and under the "general" tab check "widescreen" and save)
This will prevent the "cutting off" of the bottom parts or scrambling of your text in these presentations.

If you downloaded BBO recently, you will not be able to get online with the windows version...
You can still change or check your settings: 
Go to your C disc, and under "programs" find the Bridge Base Online folder
Open it and find the "profiles" folder
Open and scroll to find: BBO_Default_Settings 
line 71 should read: WIDE_CLIENT=1
If your setting is 0, change it to 1 and save. This will change your settings to "widescreen".

As an ALTERNATIVE: Open your aaBridge program and simply drag and drop the file of this presentation 
on the aaBridge screen.

^b@2zaXXon:  Hello friends, welcome.  

In the last few weeks we have had successful battles with declarer's trumps.
From time to time our opponents will try NT contracts even with a long suit.
This makes such hands distinct,     with specific ways to fight them too
Sometimes we will cash quickly first.
Other times, we will have to attack declarer’s communications with dummy.
But most often, declarer will be able to cash his suit. 
And this will throw us into long discarding agonies!

To defend correctly, we have to imagine what will happen after all that discarding...
Let us see some examples.




MM: @d@dMany thanks to David (Major_blue) for saving the hands and editing the chat for this presentation!
And special thanks to Eileen (wyoming33), always there to help out! @d@d

Partner played the @c2 - most likely he has 3 => declarer 2 clubs
Declarer has enough entries in @d for sure...|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||at|fazzzoola: West only had 1 winning @S... so, if we take @cAce now, then lead back the @S10?

zaXXon: Good question - Do you think partner may have the @SK when leading the @S7 ?
Also, if we decide that he had led from xxxx(x), can partner have the @h or @d Ace ?
OK, too many questions - let me try to answer in same order :)|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: The @S7 can’t really be 4th best (KJ97x), most likely partner has 97xxx(x)
Should we play small here?

Thus, if partner has the @dAce, we will not miss it :) 
And   ^*bwe will return a @h^*n here, just in case partner has that Ace!
If not, maybe partner has @hK....    Does that help?|

but the @d's are still blocked and he has no entry to his hand!
There are no @S’s in dummy and the @hAce was just removed

pc|sj|at|zaXXon: In this deal, against 3NT partner starts with @SJ and dummy shows a solid @d-suit.

nt||pc|S3|lb|*cWhich spade should you play?^^sa^sa752|at|zaXXon: ...and we have our 1st problem - @sAce or small?
Tewksbabe:  small
zaXXon: Well, the @SJ could be from @sJ109, ot it could be from @sKJ109, but keep in mind declarer bid 2@S, 
making a reverse...     So, which one is more likely?
Major_Blue: West will have the @SKQ on this bidding|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt||at|stanira3: What is leading opponent’s suit supposed to tell you?
zaXXon: If I have to bet, I believe the @SK is in declarer, having @SKQxx.
wyoming33: Why did partner lead a @S ?
zaXXon: Partner just led top of a sequence.
In any case, there is no visible advantage to play small here - it is just losing tempo|

nt||at|zaXXon: Declarer's bidding tells us:   4@S's  5@h's  and @c-stopper
And we see the @cAce and @cK
It’s very likely, that West has a singleton @d, Ace or small
If so...|

Having K10x, he sure has one, but we may attack it now|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt||at|wyoming33: We should try to get rid of the @c -entry
zaXXon: If partner succeeds to remove the @cK or the @c10, we will have killed the @c-entry
Even if declarer has @cQxx, the only correct play would be to put up the @cQ and later to finnese with @c10 
- not very easy
If West started with @cQJx, there is nothing we can do...but we should try.|

Yes, at least 10 - We saw 6@S's + 2@c's + (we see) 2@d's
If he has the @dQ - then 11, but the @hAce should be with our partner.
wyoming33: If not, declarer has his 12 tricks
zaXXon: Exactly, so declarer has a @h-guess + a chance to find the @d 3-3
Which means we must keep a watchful eye on @d’s, and discard a @h |
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: Which one - not very important, partner counts too. 
He may see that if declarer has the @hQ he would claim.
Still, the @h10 looks best... tells partner that we have the Q and may make declarer to believe that we have the Ace 
and help him misguess the @h-finesse.
Remember if he thinks North has the @hAce then he plays East’s @hK.  |
