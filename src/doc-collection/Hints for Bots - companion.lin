at|^^The @dK is the set lead.  When the student (who cannot see the E-W cards) clicks the ^*b { 1st } ^*n button they need to duck that lead.|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


at|  After that, you (the problem setter) WANT the West bot to lead the @dQ.  BUT, because the bot cannot pick out which is the hardest line for the human student, it INSTEAD leads the @h5.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


bv|f,v|
n#|5|at|^^Click the ^*b { 1st } ^*n button  and check that (once you duck in N & S) the West bot leads the @h5 at trick two.|

lg|f|n#|5|at|^c@2
@. Declarer MUST always be South  -  unlike  Bot Hints (bh)  which work on  ANY deals.
@. ^*bbi'^*ns tell the Bots (East - West) to ^*b SWAP ^*n cards when certain things happen.   (Hints tell Bots what to ^*bPlay^*n)
|n#|3|at|^b@2It will help to see this example if you have the  "Study Deal visibility"  ON   -   see the documentation.
|n#|2|at|You are in 3NT and need either the @d split  OR  the @h finesse.  As you can see, neither are right for you.|
