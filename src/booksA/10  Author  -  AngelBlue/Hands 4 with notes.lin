nt|1987 Bermuda Bowl semi-final, England vs. Sweden.  South led the @H5 to the @h10 and @hK.  North continued with the @H9, ducked, and the @C9 - @CK - ducked.  The defence cut declarer's communications completely and the contract went 6 down for -2800 (E-W were actually vulnerable).  In the other room E-W played quietly in 3@D for +110.|

nt|1967 Bermuda Bowl, USA - Italy.  In the other room, East played 4@CX making.  The USA players doubled their opponents into game in both rooms!|

nt|1997 Bermuda Bowl, Brazil (E-W) vs. Norway.  On the @HA lead East encouraged with the @HJ (!), setting up a ruffing finesse for the discard of the spade loser.  The contract and opening lead were the same in the other room but Helgemo, sitting West for Norway, didn't waste the @HJ, and the slam had to go one down.|

nt|1992 Olympiad, Hong Kong (E-W) vs. Brazil.  South should have been wary, as he had no defence, and just let opponents play quietly in game.  Instead he pushed them all the way to the seven-level, only to find the grand slam was cold.|

nt|1987 Bermuda Bowl, Jamaica vs. Canada.  East led a spade.  This gave declarer a chance to make.  He correctly rose with the @SA.  Now he had to draw one or two rounds of trumps, then discard his spades on clubs and ruff the @SK down.  However, he played on clubs without drawing ^*iany^*n trumps!  That was -800, rather than +2470: -17 imps instead of +18!|

nt|This deal ios from the quarter-final of the 1984 Olympiad.  5@D was intended as a lead-directing heart raise but was misunderstood by West.  North's double allowed his opponents to escape to 5@H, which could have been made with a successful heart guess.|

nt|This is a famous hand from the 1965 European Championships.  E-W were Collings - Cansino for England.  There seems little point in going all the way to 7@S immediately - West could always bid 6@S and then 7@S later if he wanted.  Collings got a diamond ruff in his hand when South underled the @SAK, and eventually a long diamond, for 'only' ten down.|

nt|This is the most famous hand from the 1981 BBC television series "Grand Slam".  E-W were Moss-Mitchell for the USA, facing Gardener - Davies of England.  North assumed the forcing pass over 7@S showed interest in 7NT.  East led the @DA out of turn (!) but N-S didn't notice.  They could have forbidden the lead and actually made 7NT!|
