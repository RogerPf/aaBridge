fp|3|bg|8|ht|c|mn|Planning a No-trump play:     The "Avoidance play" part Three|
tu|y|

fp|1|cp|2|
ht|f|at|^bAn avoidance play might occasionally be a lead through a hostile control, planning to gain a trick in|
ht|g|at|^ba suit if the opponent wins the trick with his control, and a tempo if he does not.|
ht|i|at|^bUnlike all other forms of avoidance play in where we manage the play in such a way that PREVENTS| 
ht|j|at|^bthe dangerous hand from gaining the lead, in the present form we GIVE the dangerous hand a chance|
ht|k|at|^bto gain the lead but he has to pay expensive price for doing that.|
ht|m|at|^bThis form of avoidance play is used when you, as declarer, cannot prevent the dangerous opponent|
ht|n|at|^bfrom gaining the lead.|
ht|p|at|^bIn the most common situations of this play, you lead a low card through a defender's Ace. If he plays| 
ht|q|at|^blow, you score one trick and a vital tempo without losing the lead to the dangerous opponent.|
ht|r|at|^bIf, instead, he rises with the Ace, he beats thin air, giving you an extra trick.| 
ht|t|fp|2|at|^bA Guideline for all the hands including in this movie:|
ht|u|fp|1|at|^bIdentify the  dangerous opponent – the defender who may risk you by attacking your vulnerable holding.|
ht|w|at|^bTry to locate the missing Aces by inference (e.g., from the bidding) or, lucking any information, locate|
ht|x|at|^bthem, mentally, in where you need them to be for your contract to succeed. This will give you the idea|
ht|y|at|^babout how to proceed with your play to cause the dangerous opponents pay for winning a trick in a suit.|

ht|f|at|^bThe movie designed to allow you first to make your plan with both defenders' hands closed.|
ht|h|at|^bUse this ^$40 to get the auction and the opening lead, and this ^$41 to move to the next deal.|
ht|j|at|^bThen you will find the same set of deals with all four hands visible. This will allow you to check whether|
ht|k|at|^byour plan was correct and to play through all the possible variations, including the defense options.|
ht|m|at|^bLater, you may go to the last page to find the solutions.|

ht|f|at|^bDeal 1: If you lose a diamond trick, you will need one from hearts. That means you may lose the lead|
ht|g|at|^btwice and meanwhile East, if he gains the lead, can play a club through the AJ. To make nine tricks certain,|
ht|h|at|^bwin trick one in dummy and lead a low heart through East. If East goes up with the Ace, you have nine tricks.|
ht|j|at|^bIf the King holds, switch to diamonds. Gaining that vital tempo, you have time to lose a diamond and|
ht|k|at|^bstill make nine tricks. If the King loses to the Ace, West cannot clear the clubs in one lead (as could East).|


ht|m|at|^bDeal 2: You have seven top tricks in the black suits and may have to knock out both red Aces to create|
ht|n|at|^bthe two extra tricks you need. You have no idea of the location of the red Aces.|
ht|o|at|^bSince East is the dangerous hand (the player who can attack your spade tenace), you should aim to make|
ht|p|at|^bhim pay a high price for taking his red Ace.|
ht|r|at|^bCross to dummy with a club and lead a low diamond towards your hand. If East holds the @DA, there|
ht|s|at|^bis nothing he can do. If he wins the Ace, you will have at least two diamond tricks, enough for the contract.| 
ht|u|at|^bIf instead he ducks, you will have one of the red-suit tricks that you need and gaining a tempo, turn to|
ht|v|at|^bhearts to establish another one.| 
ht|x|at|^bIf West wins the @DA, there will be no difficulties because he cannot continue spades safely. Win whatever|
ht|y|at|^bother suit he returns and set up a ninth trick in hearts.|

ht|f|at|^bDeal 3: Play a diamond to the Jack at trick two and lead a low club from dummy. If East has the Ace and|
ht|g|at|^bplay it, the contract becomes certain, while if West has the Ace, he can’t risk you whatever he returns.|
ht|i|at|^bIf, instead, East plays low, win the @CJ, play a diamond to the Queen and return a low heart from dummy.|
ht|j|at|^bIf East has the Ace and plays it, you have nine tricks, while if he plays the nine instead, win the @HK and|
ht|k|at|^bestablish your ninth trick by reverting to clubs.|
ht|m|at|^bIf West holds one of the missing Aces, or even both, he cannot do any harm because your spades will be|
ht|n|at|^bdouble stopped.|

ht|p|at|^bDeal 4: You have seven top tricks in the black suits and must set up two tricks in the red suits before|
ht|q|at|^bEast can enjoy his long cards in spades. East’s must hold both missing Aces to justify his opening bid.|
ht|r|at|^bCross to dummy with a club and lead a diamond towards your hand.|
ht|t|at|^bEast can win the lead if he chooses by raising with the Ace, but he will pay an unacceptable price – he will|
ht|u|at|^bset up both the @DK and the @DQ, giving you the contract.|
ht|w|at|^bIf East plays low on the first round of diamonds, you will gain the diamond trick without surrendering the lead.|
ht|x|at|^bReturn to dummy with a club to lead towards the @HK.|

fp|1|bg|8|
ht|f|at|^bDeal 5: Win the first trick with the @HK (there is no point in a hold-up play because you know from the bidding|
ht|g|at|^bthat East holds the two missing Aces), then lead a low spade from dummy.|
ht|i|at|^bIf East wins the Ace, you will score three spade tricks, enough for the contract. If instead he plays low, you will|
ht|j|at|^bgain a spade trick with the king and turn to the diamond suit for the two extra tricks you need.|

ht|l|at|^bDeal 6: You have five major tricks and need to establish four from the minors. If you start with diamonds,|
ht|m|at|^bWest, after winning the Ace will draw your last spade stopper, and later, after winning the @CA, will grab|
ht|n|at|^bthree spades to beat the contract. The same will happen if you play the @CQ first.| 
ht|p|at|^bTo ensure your game you must play the @C7 first. If West jumps with his Ace, you rightfully earn your game.|
ht|q|at|^bIf West ducks, switch peacefully to the diamonds.|  

ht|s|at|^bDeal 7: The correct play, since East is marked with the @HA, is to cross to dummy with a club and lead a low|
ht|t|at|^bheart. If East goes up with the Ace, it beats the air. If East plays low, win the Jack and shift to diamonds.|

ht|v|at|^bDeal 8: Provided the clubs break 3-2, you need to develop two tricks. You know from West's opening bid that|
ht|w|at|^bthe diamond finesse will fail and the suit will not break 3-3.|
ht|y|at|^blead the @D5 towards dummy. If West wins with the King, he will give you two extra diamond tricks and the| 
ht|z|at|^bcontract. If instead he plays low, win the @DJ, cross to your hand with a club and lead towards the @HK.|
