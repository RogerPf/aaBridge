mn| Introduction to trump play 
 for Beginning Bridge Program|
tu|y|
ht|g|fp|1|cp|2|at|^bThe bidding often designates a suit as the trump suit and that suit becomes the trump suit 
^bfor the entire hand.

^bPlaying in a suit contract is, in many ways, similar to playing in a No trump contract. 

^bThe first step is to make a plan before playing a card to the first trick. 

^bYou still have to consider the best way of taking what you deserve. 

^bYou may have to play a suit with more cards on one side than the other in the right order – the 
^bhigh card from the short side. 

^bYou may focus on your goal so that you are not tempted to jeopardize the contract in an attempt 
^bto get an extra trick which you don't need. 

^bOther than that, it is quite straightforward. If you don't have the number of tricks you need, 
^byou can try to develop extra tricks by promoting winners in your solid suits, by establishing 
^bthe small cards in long suits or by finessing against higher cards than you hold in a suit.

^bWe have seen that there are similarities between playing No trump and suit contracts.

^bLet’s now consider the differences.|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


nt||

ht|g|fp|1|cp|2|at|^bThe trump suit does have an effect on your priorities. You may have all the tricks you need, 
^bfor example, and yet, if you don't play the trump suit first, you may find one of your sure tricks 
^bloses to an opponent's small trump card. 

^bHowever, on many hands you cannot afford to draw the trumps because other things take priority.
^bFor example: you may need to ruff losers in dummy or to discard a loser before the defenders 
^bgain the lead, or a trump entry to dummy is required.    

^bThe first step in playing a hand in a suit contract is to consider your goal. 

^bIf you are in a contract of 4@H, for instance, you need ten tricks. In a contract of 6@D, you need 
^btwelve tricks. 

^bAfter you have stopped to consider your goal, the next step is to discover how close you are to 
^bachieve this goal. In other words, you need to know how many losers you can afford and still make 
^byour contract. 

^bIf you are in a contract of 4@S, you can afford three losers. In a contract of 6@C, you can afford 
^bonly one loser.

^bWhen you compare the number of losers you can afford to the number of losers you have and find 
^bthat you have too many losers, you want to organize a way to get rid of your extra losers (the losers 
^byou can't afford).|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||

ht|f|fp|1|cp|2|at|^bThere are two methods of getting rid of losers in a suit contract that are not available in a 
^bNo-trump contract. 

^cOne way of getting rid of losers in your hand is to ruff them in dummy. 

^cThe second way is to discard your losers by using dummy's strength in 
^canother suit.

^bWe will develop these methods in more detail in our lessons, but here are the general ideas:

^bThere are two main groups of losers:
^b1.   ^cQuick (or immediate) losers – tricks that can be won by the defenders 
^cwhenever they get the lead.

^b2.   ^cSlow (or eventual) losers – tricks that cannot be taken immediately by 
^cthe defenders, but will be eventually lost if you don't take care of them.

^bYou should also distinct between two sub types of losers :
^ca. ^dInevitable: losers that the defenders can win at will and you can't do 
^danything about that.

^cb. ^dConditional: losers that you can avoid by ruffing, discarding or finessing.

^bAs you can't do anything about your inevitable losers, you must pay a primary attention to 
^byour conditional losers.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||

ht|f|fp|1|cp|2|at|^bThat means:

^b1. ^cRecognizing and counting them.

^b2. ^cPreserving the required number of trumps to ruff them.

^b3. ^cLooking for extra winners in dummy that can be used for discard.

^b4. ^cIf possible, preventing the defenders from gaining the lead before you get rid 
^cof your extra losers.

^bRemember: you should always plan your play, and you must do that BEFORE touching a single card!!!

^b1. ^cCount your losers, start with the trump suit.

^b2. ^cVarify your losers (quick/slow – inevitable/conditional).

^b3. ^cRelate your loser count to the contract to learn how many losers you can afford.

^b4. ^cIf you have too many losers, plan on how to get rid of them, while preserving the required entries.

^b5. ^cAsk yourself whether or not you can afford drawing trumps immediately – completely or partly.

^b6. ^cHaving decided on your plan, put it into operation.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||
ht|g|fp|1|cp|2|at|^bRuffing in the hand where the long trump is placed, is generally not a good way to win trump tricks. 

^bFrequently, especially when confronting unfavorable trump division in the defenders' hands, it may 
^bcause you to lose control of the game.

^bMost of the time you can gain tricks only by ruffing your losers in the hand that has the shorter trump 
^bholding.

^BFor that reason, you should also count your losers from the view point of the hand that has the longer 
^btrump holding, usually the declarer's. We call this hand the "MASTER-HAND".

^bThe hand with the longer trump holding serves also as a controlling hand. 

^bIt is because the trumps in this hand can be used to draw the outstanding trumps and to prevent the 
^bdefenders from taking enough tricks to defeat your contract.

^bFor that reason, you can’t have more losers in a suit than the number of cards you hold in this suit in 
^bthe hand that contains the larger number of trumps.|

Would you take the finesse?|

ht|g|fp|1|cp|2|at|^bThe delightful aspect of counting losers is that there is a chance to get rid of them.

^bIt is important to spot the characteristics in your hand and dummy that offer the opportunity to ruff 
^blosers in dummy or to discard losers on dummy's strength. 

^bTo choose the proper line of play between these two options, you should try to identify a side suit which 
^bis unevenly divided between your hand and dummy.


^bRUFFING LOSERS IN DUMMY

^bYou may take several things into consideration when thinking about using the dummy's trumps to get rid 
^bof your losers. 

^bFirst, you have to recognize the hand pattern where the opportunity exists: you have to select a side suit 
^bwhere there are more cards in your hand than in dummy.

^bSecond, you may have to play the suit more than once, perhaps giving up the lead while doing it. Though 
^bIt is convenient to have a void in dummy when you are planning to ruff losers, this won't always be the 
^bcase – sometimes you will have to play the side suit once or twice until dummy has a void in the suit. 

^bThis, additionally, means, that you may have to preserve entries back to your hand. 

^bFinally, the trumps have to be carefully handled, in order to preserve the number of dummy's trumps you 
^bneed to take care of the losers in your hand.|

ht|g|fp|1|cp|2|at|^bDISCARDING LOSERS 

^bAgain, you are looking for an unevenly divided side suit but, this time, instead of having fewer cards in 
^bdummy than in your hand, you want to have more cards in dummy than in your hand.

^bThis time, the extra strength in dummy, rather than the shortness, is used to eliminate some of the losers 
^bin your hand. 

^bYou may take several things into consideration when thinking about using the dummy's strength to get rid of 
^byour losers. 

^bFirst, you have to recognize the hand pattern where the opportunity exists: look for a side suit where there 
^bare more cards in dummy than in your hand. 

^bThis is the reverse of the pattern required when you wish to ruff losers in dummy.

^bSecond, you may have to play the suit several times before you can use it for throwing away a loser (or 
^blosers).

^bThird, you may have to arrange communication with dummy so that you are in a position to actualize your 
^bplan.

^bFinally, the trumps have to be carefully handled, since you may need them to assist the establishment job.

^bLet's put the ideas into action.|

ht|g|cp|2|fp|1|at|^bThe last two deals indicated the wisdom of making a plan BEFORE YOU PLAY TO THE FIRST TRICK. 

^bThere are two main strategies of planning a bridge hand.

^bThe first is the strategy of "I will play the cards and see what would happen". 

^bIn other words: let’s wait until things have gone badly wrong. Then, at around trick five, you sit back in 
^byour chair and wonder if you can retrieve the situation. This is of course a false strategy!

^bThe second strategy is to start the process of planning immediately after the opening lead appears on 
^bthe table and BEFORE PLAYING A SINGLE CARD FROM DUMMY.

^bIt is an undisputed fact of life at the bridge table, that victories are not achieved by some accidental fall of 
^bthe cards at tricks 10, 11, 12, or 13. 

^bFar more often than you can imagine, bridge games are won or lost right at the opening lead, when the 
^bdefenders launch their initial attack.

^bWhat happens at trick one often leads to victory or defeat. The correct play is made, and victory becomes 
^bguaranteed. However, when an incorrect play is made, defeat may become unavoidable. 

^bIf, for instant, you win the opening lead in the wrong hand or with the wrong card, or fail to hold up an Ace 
^bor King when it should be done, or hold up when it should not, more often than not there can be no recovery 
^band no escape.|
pg| ***** 1228 ***** |


nt||

ht|g|cp|2|fp|1|at|^bThe first trick is not merely the play of four cards, one by each player. 

^bThere is a background in the bidding. There is a context created by the visible cards, presumed layout 
^band distribution of the hidden cards and the expectable location of honors and/or high-spot cards.

^bConsequently, there is the effect on the outcome of the remaining twelve tricks.



^j     @S@H@D@CSUMMARY@S@H@D@C

^bThis article was mainly about counting losers and handling them. 

^bBut it was also designed to show you, that the only way to make your mistakes worthwhile, is 
^bto appreciate them for what they are: precious lessons that can only be learned the hard way. 

^bThus, the key question is not whether you make or fail to make your contract, but what you take with 
^byou afterward: the moral each deal offers, the benefit of learning a new aspect of the game, the 
^bopportunity to promote your judgment and to upgrade your card sense, and your willingness to apply 
^bnew elements into your future games. 

^bThe reward would be quite substantial.
