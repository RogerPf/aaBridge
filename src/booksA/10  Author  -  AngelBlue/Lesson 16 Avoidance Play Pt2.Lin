fp|3|bg|8|ht|c|mn|Planning a No-trump play:   The "Avoidance play" part Two|
tu|y|

fp|1|cp|2|
ht|g|at|^bAll the following hands are based on situations where you need to develop a suit without allowing the|
ht|h|at|^bdangerous hand to gain the lead. But as opposed to the hands in part one of this topic, your holding in|
ht|i|at|^bthe suit you want to establish does not contain a finessing combination or it contains only a finesse that|
ht|j|at|^bwould lose to the dangerous hand. In this case you need a special treatment to force the safe hand to|
ht|k|at|^bwin the trick with a missing honor, thereby establishing your suit safely.|
ht|m|fp|1|at|^bA Guideline for all the hands including in this movie:|
ht|n|fp|1|at|^bBe always on the look-out whether or not a defender may risk your game by taking control of the|
ht|o|at|^bled suit or by shifting to a suit in which your holding is vulnerable.| 
ht|q|at|^bBefore playing to trick one, identify the dangerous opponent. This will give you the ideas about:|
ht|r|at|^b1. Whether or not it is essential to hold up to exhaust the short-suit holder of his cards in the led suit.|
ht|s|at|^b2. How to proceed with your play to prevent the dangerous opponents from gaining the lead.| 
ht|u|at|^bThe movie designed to allow you first to make your plan with both defenders' hands closed.|
ht|v|at|^bUse this ^$40 to get the auction and the opening lead, and this ^$41 to move to the next deal.|
ht|w|at|^bThen you will find the same set of deals with all four hands visible. This will allow you to check whether|
ht|x|at|^byour plan was correct and to play through all the possible variations, including the defense options.|
ht|y|at|^bLater, you may go to the last page to find the solutions.|

ht|f|at|^bDeal 1: The contract can be made when West holds a guarded @DQ. The safest plan would be then to lead|
ht|g|at|^btwice towards dummy's @DAK, ducking when the Queen appears from West at any stage,  surrendering the|
ht|h|at|^blead to the safe hand.|
ht|j|at|^bDeal 2: You must win immediately to prevent East of leading club through my unguarded King. At trick two, lead|
ht|k|at|^ba spade towards the King, ducking when the Queen appears, winning in dummy and repeat the process|
ht|l|at|^bwhen West plays low.| 
ht|m|at|^bNote: It would be wrong to play your diamond winners following with three rounds of spades, hoping that West|
ht|n|at|^bwould win and have to lead a club. West can naturally unblock the @SQ, so East will win the third spade.|
ht|p|at|^bDeal 3: Hold up trick one in case West has five hearts.|
ht|q|at|^bIf then you lead a club to dummy and win the King, West will win the club return and knock out your last heart|
ht|r|at|^bstopper. West then will wait patiently with his high club and good hearts and you will lose the contract.|
ht|s|at|^bWin the second heart and  play a small club. Assuming West follows low instead of playing the King, play the 8,| 
ht|t|at|^bdeliberately lose the trick to East – the non-dangerous hand. If East shifts to diamonds, you must refuse the finesse|
ht|u|at|^band go right up with the Ace to continue the assault on the club suit.|
ht|w|at|^bDeal 4: After winning the first trick with the @HJ, you must tackle the club suit to get the ninth trick. Because of the|
ht|x|at|^bvulnerability of the @HK, It will be okay now to give up the lead to West, but not to East. Lead clubs from your hand|  
ht|y|at|^band duck when West raises with the Queen.|
ht|z|at|^bNote: you can't make your game whenever West holds a singleton or small doubleton in the club suit.|

ht|f|at|^bDeal 5: When the @SQ holds at trick one, it becomes clear that West has the @SA so, in order to protect your @SK,|
ht|g|at|^b you must avoid losing the lead to East (e.g., by finessing diamonds through West (the normal play). Return to your|
ht|h|at|^bhand with a heart, lead a diamond to the King and duck when the Queen appears from West.|
ht|j|at|^bDeal 6: East's overcall marks him with five or six spades, leaving West with at most two. So you should duck the first|
ht|k|at|^bspade but should win the continuation with the Ace. You need to keep East off lead and must hope that West holds|
ht|l|at|^b@DQxx. Lead small diamonds from your hand and duck when the Quenn appears.|
ht|m|at|^bNote: If you hold up the spades more than once, West can beat you by discarding the @DQ under the third spade.|
ht|o|at|^bDeal 7: Again, you must win the second round of spade to disallow a winning discard by East. Then you should| 
ht|p|at|^bplay the hand the same way as in deal 6.|
ht|r|at|^bDeal 8: Hold up the @SA until the third round to cut communication between the defenders. Then You must arrange|
ht|s|at|^bthe play so that you lose a diamond trick to East rather than to West. At trick four, cross to dummy with the @CA and|
ht|t|at|^blead diamond towards your hand. If East raise with the King, you will allow it to win. He will have no spade to play after|
ht|u|at|^byou held up the suit and your remaining diamonds will be good. If, instead, East plays small diamond, you should|
ht|v|at|^bfinesse the @DQ. Pleased to see the Queen wins, you must now be careful. If you play the @DA next, you will go down.|
ht|w|at|^bWest will win the third round of diamonds and defeat you. Return to dummy with the @HA and lead a second diamond|
ht|x|at|^btowards your hand. If the King appears from East, you should duck. When East started with @DKxx and he plays low on|
ht|y|at|^bthe second round, win the Ace and concede a third round to East.|
