ht|f|fp|2|cs|1|cp|2|at|^b{Introduction}|
ht|h|fp|1|cp|2|at|Interfering over an opening bid is a weapon that is used by today's bridge players in high frequency. They rarely leave their opponents undisturbed and doing always their best to declare that a bridge table is for four  rather than two players

As you will have to deal with interference often, you better get some weapons of your own to counter that. 

This article will investigate the bidding options for responder after his right-hand opponent has interfered and will show you how to deal with interferences.

We will learn to distinct between different interventions and discuss rules that are valid for the various situations. 

In all the example hands of this article, you, the reader, will be sitting East.|

ht|s|fp|1|cs|1|cp|2|at|^b{Part one: Responding over a Take-out double}|
ht|u|fp|1|cp|2|at|The double by the right-hand opponent doesn't take any bidding space from the responder and allows him to use any bid that was available without the double.


Moreover, the responder has a new possibility available: the Redouble.

So now we can formulate a rule for the responder's bidding over the double: ^*BAny bid by responder will describe the 
same kind of hand as it would be without the double^*N.| 

ht|w|fp|1|cp|2|at|In other words: the responder should ignore the double and bid as if it was not made!|

Notwithstanding, with a relatively weak (6-7 points) hand, the responder is allowed to use his judgement on whether 
to bid or to pass if he assumes that it would be better to let the opponents play the hand.|

ht|l|fp|1|cp|2|at|Look at this hand. Wouldn't it be better for you to simply pass and force South to bid one of the unbid suits at the two level as 
a response to North's double?

So as we can see, there will be cases in which the responder may give precedence to a pass in order to force the opponents to make a bid. 

As we are going to discover, in many other situations the responder may consider bidding in order to make it difficult for the opponents to compete.

Apparently, ignoring the double seems a good solution in many cases.

There are cases however, where he would prefer to use the double to his own advantage.|

ht|f|cs|9|at|^l{|ih|pskqt7haq94d6cat76|at|}|
ht|h|cs|9|at|{|ia|1cx?|at|}|
ht|l|fp|1|cp|2|at|You have 15 points, West and North showed at least 12 points each. A simple count shows that South has nothing. 

Had you made the standard 1@S bid, South will be happily freed from his duty to bid something as a response to North's double.

You should recognize the opportunity to take advantage of North's double for your own partnership's benefit. The solution would be to redouble, intending to eventually punish the opponents.

This can be a possible continuation:|

ht|r|cs|9|at|^j{|ia|1dd!r1spp!d|at|}|
ht|w|fp|1|cp|2|at|As the redouble has shown willingness to punish the opponents, your double should be taken for penalties. This double 
is an exceptions to the rule of which a one-level double is for take-out.

Considering the balance of the strength and the good trumps in your hand, it would be very difficult for South 
to gain tricks. A final result of +800 may be reasonable and much more profitable than a game by your partnership.|

ht|l|fp|1|cp|2|at|This is also a typical hand for a redouble – a balanced 10+ point hand. As the auction develops, your partnership should 
decide on whether to punish the opponents or to bid a contract of your own.|

ht|o|fp|1|cp|2|at|It has to be said that a redouble is not a must with every 10+ point hand.|

ht|v|fp|1|cp|2|at|In this hand you have two five-card suits and shortness in spades. You should understand that the opponents are supposed to have a spade fit and a contract in spades would probably be safe for them. 

Therefore, instead of planning on punishment, it would be much better for you to introduce your two long suits, hearts first.|

ht|f|fp|1|cp|2|at|As opposed to one-level responses over a right-hand opponent's double, a two-level bid by the responder, which should 
be considered as a forcing bid in an uncontested auction, is not forcing any longer and will describe a 6-9 point hand with 
a good 5+ card suit.|

ht|f|fp|1|cp|2|at|Combining both the redouble and the sequential 2@C, descibes a 10+ point hand with at least five clubs.

Remember: when you redoubled, you committed yourself to another bid. 

Your redouble should be considered by your partner as a recommendation to pass on his next turn. 

On the other hand, if you redouble and then bid a suit, it is forcing, partner cannot pass!

Your interest was not punishment, but introducing your long suit through a forcing sequence.

Finally, let's deal with a simple case of supporting opener's suit over a double. 

In uncontested auctions, you will usually need a 6-9 point hand for a two-level support. 

The double allows you to show your support with a hand that is weaker than usual. Now the objective is to cause difficulties for the opponents.|

ht|y|fp|1|cp|2|at|Despite having only five points, but considering an almost certain heart fit for the opponents, your 2@S bid may 
give your  partnership a huge advantage, because now the opponents have to explore for the heart fit at the three level.|

ht|h|cs|9|at|{|ia|1cx!2s|at|}|
ht|l|fp|1|cp|2|at|Under standard criteria, your hand is too weak for a 1@S bid.

Let's first examine the situation: 

West and North have promised 12+ points each. There is good reason to believe that South holds at least one of the 
red suits and a hand far stronger than yours.

Had you decided to pass, the opponents would have an easy life exploring for their best contract. 

A 1@S bid would also not stop them from achieving their goal. 

On the other hand, a 2@S bid, which by agreement describes a weak (usually no more than six points) hand with six+ spades, may cause South real difficulties.

Unless agreed otherwise, every jump in a contested auction would describe a weak hand. 

The main purpose of those jumps is similar to that of the preempt opening, which is to steal bidding space from the opponents and to describe an accurate picture of the hand to partner, allowing him to make the right decisions as the auction progresses.|

ht|f|fp|1|cp|2|at|To better understand the idea behind the jump bid, here are a few more example on this subject:|
ht|g|cs|9|at|^l{|ih|ps94ht75dqjt7654c9|at|}|
ht|i|cs|9|at|{|ia|1cx!2d|at|}|
ht|m|fp|1|cp|2|at|You are not afraid to bid with only three points. Your goal is to disturb the opponents' ability to find their contract. You also know that your chance to be allowed to play 2@D doubled is slim. Your partner, from his side, knows that the 2@D indicates a weak hand and there is not much to expect from your hand. 

Many experienced players would not be contented with 2@D and prefer to bid 3@D to increase the disturbance. The role of vulnerbility should also be taken into consideration.| 

ht|r|cs|9|at|^l{|ih|ps6ht986dajt86ct84|at|}|
ht|s|cs|9|at|{|ia|1dx!3d|at|}|
ht|x|fp|1|cp|2|at|With five points and a good fit in diamonds, you can expect that a 3@D contract is fairly safe even if partner opened with only three diamonds. You can also expect that the opponents have a spade contract and your jump to 3@D may make it difficult for them to find it. The number of points required for this jump depends on the vulnerability. Of course, partner should treat it as 
a preemptive support and not expect you to hold 10-12 points.|

ht|l|fp|1|cp|2|at|You know about the 11+ card fit. If North-South would be allowed to play a heart contract, there is a good chance that your side would not take even a single spade trick. In other words, there is a very good chance for the opponents to make a heart game (or even more). 

On the other hand, a spade game can also be made despite the minority in points, that is because of the ruffing potential. An immediate jump to 4@S may cause South a difficult problem of whether to give up and pass, bid 5@H or double the 4@S contract. 

Again, the jump to 4@S describes a weak hand, usually with at least five spades.|

In principle, if responder has a weak hand but a guaranteed 9-10 card fit in 
opener's suit, a jump in this suit may be rewarding, at the least it will be disturbing.

In those cases, the "Law Of Total Tricks" may be helpful. Concisely, you may bid to the 
level which is equal to the combined number of cards held by your side in the suit you wish to set as trump.|

The solution is to display the support by cue bidding the opponent's suit.

ht|n|fp|1|cp|2|at|This is not the place for a thorough discussion of the Negative double convention, but to not leave you empty handed, 
here are some basic rules:

1. A double over a simple overcall describes a hand with four cards or more in an unbid major. In the above example, 
    the double shows a 7+ point hand and exactly four spades. With more than four spades, the responder would 
    bid 1@S. Note that despite the flat nature of the hand and the heart stopper, it is far better to show the spade 
    suit first. Most of the time A spade contract will be better.

2. The Negative double can also be made with five cards in the unbid major. That would be when responder does not 
     have enough strength for a two level bid in this major. 

3. As we can deduce from rule 2, when responder's first bid is Negative double and he later bids a suit, he shows a 
    five+ card suit with insufficient strngth to bid the suit at the two level. 

4. After a 1@D overcall over an opening bid of 1@C, a Negative double would show at least four cards in 
    both majors. Remember: with only one four-card major suit the responder should bid it directly.|

if South passes, so responder's initial pass would not cause the partnership to lose a contract if there is one for them.|

Had North passed, you would have aspired to play a 4@H contract. 

But now, knowing that North has at least five hearts headed by two top honors, you would do better to let him play and try to defeat him. In bridge terms, this pass is called a "Trap pass".

However, if  responder bids the double himself,  his partner will surely take it to be Negative double and the partnership may lose a good opportunity to punish the opponents. 

Conclution: the double should come from partner's side.|

ht|l|fp|1|cp|2|at|The double may look strange. After all, you were silent and opener is bare minimum. What is opener looking for?

Had he learnt the previous example carefully (as you did), he should know that, despite your pass, you might hold 9-10 points or even more. Moreover, you may hold a "trap pass" hand, in which case you would be waiting for a double from his side. 

If partner skips the opportunity to double, it may turn out expensive. 

Rule: ^*BWhen the bid comes back to the opener after an overcall followed with two passes and opener 
          holds a singleton or a doubleton in the opponent's suit, the best bid will usually be a double.^*N|

ht|t|fp|1|cp|2|at|Of course, if the responder does not have a hand that qualifies as a "trap pass", he must not leave the double in, but bid instead.

It has to be said that when the opener is void in the opponent's suit, he would do better by not doubling. That is because in 
this case they may make their bid. It would be much better for the opener to bid a suit instead. 

If the opener has three or more cards in the opponent's suit, he is not obliged to leave the auction open any longer and may pass. That is because in this case there is no chance that rsponder's pass was a "trap".|

This time a 3@S bid by you is supported by the Low Of Total Tricks, but it should be noted that you may bid the same with only three cards in support for partner's spades.

Finally, a clarification of high-level Negative double. In the far past it was acknowledged as a penalty double with no exceptions. Nowadays' experts prefer using a double at the three and four levels, over a preemptive jump by the opponents, 
as Negative, based on strength and length in the unbid suits, instead of length and strength in the opponents' suit.

Notwithstanding, there is yet a good chance that the opener may prefer to convert the high-level double to a penalty double. Therfore it is customary in modern bridge to see that double as optional (hence the term "Optional double") and let the opener decide whether to leave the double in or to continue bidding.|

a strong holding and hands like the above are more likely. Therefore, responder should have a way to deal with them.

In the above hand, a pass would not be a good option as responder does not have enough entries to establish his long spade 
against 1NT contract.

On the other hand, there is a good chance that the 2@S contract will make, and even if it goes down a trick, 
it can yield a good score in comparison to a 1NT contract by the opponents.|

to have only one heart stopper so after forcing it out, your partner will have four heart tricks. Partner has promised opening srtength and your kings will probably produce two tricks. All in all, a 2@H bid will be too modest. Double!

As a general rule, when the partnership holds the majority of points, there is an excellent chance to set a 1NT contract. 
With a 9+ point hand and no extreme distribution, double them!|

ht|g|fp|1|cs|1|cp|2|at|^b{Part four: After a two-suited intervention.}|
ht|i|fp|1|cp|2|at|Here I will focus on one of many tools availble for the overcaller to describe two suited hands – the Unusual 2NT.

The Unusual 2NT bid describes a hand with length in the two lowest unbid suits, usually five-five but can be longer.

One of the most difficult problems in a contested auction arises after the opponents interfere with bids indicating two-suited hands. 

The reason being that these bids act preemptively, they steal bidding space that our side needs in order to explore for the best contract. Moreover, they limit our possibilities to show many kinds of hands.

The conservative way to confront such interference was using a cue bid to show control in one of the two suits, asking partner to bid 3NT if he can control the second suit. 

For example, after 1@H opening and a 2NT (showing length in both minors) by responder's right-hand opponent, a 3@D cue bid promises a control in the suit, asking partner to bid 3NT if he has a control in clubs. 

Can you see the problem with this approach? Why would we assume that 3NT should be our best contract after the opponents just told us the suits don't split evenly? 

Why then shouldn't we look for a way to describe our holding in the other two suits?|

ht|m|fp|1|cp|2|at|After a 1@S opening, the Unusual 2NT convention describes a hand with two long minors.

In this example, the meaning of the 3@S bid is the same as it would be over a preemptive Jump: 8-10 points 
with a support for opener's suit and willingness to play a spade contract rather than defending against 3@C or 3@D.|

ht|w|fp|1|cp|2|at|With a ten-card fit, a game in spades is worth considering. As usual, this jump shows less than opening values.

How then would the responder show a strong support for opener's suit? Over RHO interferring with a suit, the responder 
may use the cue bid to describe his hand. As the Unusual 2NT bid shows two suits, the responder now has two suits available for a cue bid.|

ht|f|fp|1|cp|2|at|How should the responder take advantage of this situation?

The most useful conventional agreement for those situations is the "Unusual Vs. Unusual". It work as follows:

1. Cue bidding the lowest suit describes a good hand with support for opener's suit.|

ht|j|cs|9|at|^l{|ih|psa864hak76d52cKt3|at|}|
ht|l|cs|9|at|{|ia|1s2n!3c|at|}|
ht|p|fp|1|cp|2|at|Your 3@C is a cue bid of the lowest suit described by the Unusual 2NT and shows a strong hand with a support for your partner's major.

2. Cue bidding the highest suit describes five cards or more in the unbid suit. This cue bid is a game forcing bid!|
ht|s|cs|9|at|^l{|ih|psA4hakj87d65ct982|at|}|
ht|t|cs|9|at|{|ia|1s2n!3d|at|}|
ht|y|fp|1|cp|2|at|No doubts, you want to play in a 4@H or 4@S contract (rarely 3NT). Your 3@D bid, which is a cue bid in the highest suit 
described by the unusual 2NT bidder, shows an opening hand with five+ hearts.|

ht|f|fp|1|cp|2|at|The second option for the responder is double. Most of today's experts do not use the double for take out but for penalties.

ht|r|fp|1|cp|2|at|There are cases where the responder can punish only one of the possible contracts but he hopes that the opener can punish the second suit. In those cases, a double would keep all the options open.|
