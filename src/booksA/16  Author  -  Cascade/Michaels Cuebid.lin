mb|2H|nt|2@h is also not my style.  With four trumps and a singleton I would raise more strongly.|

mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|I am not sure what GIB intended with 2@s.  Some sort of cue-bid with club support I guess.  I would have made this sort of bid on the previous round.|

mb|4H|nt|North also emerges from the woodwork with a more aggressive raise that I would recommend on the previous round.|
