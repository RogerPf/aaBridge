^B@2^*Bcaitlin: ^*N|cp||at|So What Do We Mean by ‘Reading the Opponents’ Cards?|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


at|
As declarer we want to gather as much information about the opponents’ hands, especially if we have too many losers at a suit contract and/or not enough winners at notrump. What are these pieces of information? They are as follows:

A)     Bidding by an opponent who overcalls or makes a takeout double
B)     Bidding by an opponent who opens the bidding
C)     Bidding by an opponent who preempts: a two-level preempt places a known 6 cards, just as a three-level places 7 cards in that opponent’s hand
D)     Lack of bidding by an opponent whose partner opens the bidding, makes a takeout double or who overcalls.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


at|

What about information we get when an a opponent makes a lead?|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|

A)     The lead of the Ace (from AK), when neither declarer or dummy has the King, most often means the opponent on lead has the King.
B)     Assuming no doubleton lead, as with above, the lead of the King typically promises the Queen and the lead of Queen promises the Jack.
C)     If opponent leads the Queen and neither declarer nor dummy has the King, place it in the other opponent’s hand.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|

The above is why we take our time before playing to the first trick and REVIEW THE BIDDING and ANALYZE THE LEAD. Both will give you invaluable information.

^B@2^*Bcaitlin: ^*N|cp||at| Okay, let me give you a few examples. Please formulate your answer before clicking the forward arrow for my explanation.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


ht|i|cs|6|at|^B{|ia|,3h3sp4sppp|at|}|HT|h|AT|^m@2^Z@3After the auction what do we know about North's hand?|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT|  It is simple.  We know North has 7 hearts because of the preemptive bid.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


at| Okay, another auction.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


ht|n|at|^B{|ia|,,,1h2d3hp4hpp|at|}|HT|m|AT|^m@2^Z@3 With this auction what do we know about West's hand?|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


at| West overcalled, therefore, must have five diamonds.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


at| Take the auction on the left and West leads the @DA  playing lead of Ace from AK.  What do we know when declarer or dummy do not have@DK?|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


AT|  Where is the @DK most likely?|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


AT| West has the @dK. Okay, next.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


ht|t|at|^B{|ia|,,,1sp3sp4sppp|at|}|HT|s|AT|^m@2^Z@3With the auction on the left West opening lead is  @HQ  and neither declarer or dummy have @HK or @HJ. What does this all tell us?  Who has them?|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


AT| King of hearts is with East and West started with @HQJxx. On to another example.|

^-|CP||FP||ht|g|cs|6|at|^B{|ia|3cxp4hppp|at|}|HT|f|AT|^m@2^Z@3What if West, who preempted 3C leads a diamond against the opponents’ 4H contract?|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


AT| I would think diamond is likely a singleton. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


HT|l|at|^B{|ia|,,,1hp4hppp|at|}|HT|k|AT|^m@2^Z@3In the next auction I am sitting West and my opening lead is @C2. Do I have an @CAKxx  or @CQJxx  or @CJTxx?|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


AT| I am sure your answer was neither. If I had a sequence or say AKxx, I would lead top of sequence or the Ace.
|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


ht|s|at|^b@2^Y@3So, we learn SO much about opponents' cards from bidding or lack of and from lead. Please, take time to REVIEW the bidding as declarer, take time to ANALYZE the lead.  This is a thinking person's game, not Indy 500 so take time you need and if need be type in "thinking."|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |

When dummy comes down and we have losers we cannot afford or we go down, we look for alternatives. Let’s look at our first board. |

^B@2^*Bcaitlin: ^*N|cp||at|The contract is 4H and the opening lead is @SK--most likely from @SKQJ honor sequence. You are sitting South. Let us |CP|8|at|REVIEW THE BIDDING and ANALYZE THE LEAD.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


CP||AT| You seem to have four losers: a trump, two spades and a club. East can have only one spade, given West has five for his overcall, South has four and North has three. Therefore, for now, we know that West has 6 HCP (high card points) in spades--the KQJ. |

^B@2^*Bcaitlin: ^*N|cp||at|After winning the spade Jack West plays club ten. Now, South can take an inventory and place the @DK with East. Why? Because, West has shown ten HCPs so far. Therefore, West would not have initially passed if he also had the diamond King which would have given him 13 HCPs--six in spades, four in hearts and three in diamonds.|

^B@2^*Bcaitlin: ^*N|cp||at|The key play is to the diamond Ace. Thus, we learned that West cannot have the diamond King as that adds to 6 HCP in spades, 4 in hearts and if 3 HCP in diamonds. West would not have initially passed with 13 HCP. After gleaning that important information you play the DQ  which East should cover and you ruff. Then go back to dummy with a trump and the DJ now gets rid of the club loser. Let us try another board unless you wish to play it double dummy and check out different plays.|

^B@2^*Bcaitlin: ^*N|cp||at|Now, South can correctly place the diamond Ace. West has the Ace. Why? Because East has played  14 of his maximum 17 HCPs--nine in spades (@SAKQ), one in hearts (@HJ)and four in clubs (@CA). Therefore, he cannot have the diamond Ace. Let us go for it and play a low diamond to the dummy and win with King and see what happens.|

^B@2^*Bcaitlin: ^*N|cp||at|If East has the DAQ, this hand will go down. One can give up and say, “Oh well, down one.”  However this hand exemplifies "exploration plays."  This means you do not touch the diamonds till you find out more about the East hand which is clearly defined as 15-17 balanced HCP. Once we see the @SAKQ, the @HJ,  and the @CA, we have 14 HCP.  Thus, East must have the @DQ but cannot have the @DA as that would add up to 18 HCP and we play 15-17 NT. Therefore, hold off on that diamond suit and explore first!  If West has the CA, then there is not much you can do as then East would have to have both the @DA and @DQ.|

^B@2^*Bcaitlin: ^*N|cp||at|A good bridge player usually plays lowest of touching honors. Further West, if he is a good player, does not under lead the Ace.

^B@2^*Bcaitlin: ^*N|cp||at|With four possible losers—2 diamonds, a heart, and @SK losers we turn to the lead and what is played by East. West wins the HK  (lower of two touching honors) and it is unlikely West under led the HA against a suit contract. So, give East the @HAK. Note that West did not lead the @DA @DK so we know he does not have these two cards. Play diamonds and find out that East has the @DK. That adds to 10 HCP. Thus East cannot have the @SK. So, how do we pick up the @SK from the West hand. As I often say, “ If you need a card to be in X hand to make your contract, put it there.”  I add to that: “If you need a card to be singleton, even offside, put it singleton, even offside!”|
