{        INTRODUCTION }
^-|CP||FP||ht|f|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bcaitlin: ^*N|cp||at|Caitlin: So, for those who were not here last let us repeat the important points. What does Reading the Opponents' Cards mean to you at this point?|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|
-- It is about you as declarer reading opponents' cards.So, how do we get clues? |
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|
-- We get them by:
^c@2^Z@3A. From the bidding. For example When an opponent opens and his partner does not have enough HCP(high card points) to respond.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|
B) When an opponent overcalls. For example, when one opponent makes a takeout double but partner can't respond as your side has the HCP. |
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|
C. From the lead. For example a lead of Ace (leading Ace/King) typically promises King unless doubleton. Or the lead of King typically promises Queen. Another one is Partner opened 1S but opponents are in 4H and you lead @S10. What does that tell the partner? Sure, most likely a singleton particularly if he has the @S9 or it is in the dummy. If you have not supported, the modern theory is to low from 3. Another good example is if opponent has preempted 3H and leads say a Diamond. That lead most likely ids a singleton.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


AT| 
D) When one opponent preempts and you and partner 'buy' the contract. A preemptive bid allows you to put 6 cards if it is a 2-level preempt; 7 cards if 3-level preempt.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


AT|

-- So, this is 2nd of 4 sessions on reading HCPs and we shall see that you only have to count ONE opponents' hand. Then we spend 4 sessions on Reading Opponents Cards by shape of one opponent's hand. Okay, let's get down to business.|

^B@2^*Bcaitlin: ^*N|cp||at|What does lead of @HQ tell us?|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


at| Sure, it is top of an honor sequence. But who has the @HK and why? |
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


AT| East should have the @HK. Otherwise West would have led it before the Queen. Further, there are 16 points between East and West. West hand should be worth about 13 as he opened, therefore East has about three points. So, East cannot have the @SK as we placed the @HK with him.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bcaitlin: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let's count the losers. There is no loser in diamonds. We are missing @CAQ which most likely is with West--two clubs losers. In hearts we have two losers which we hope to ruff one and discard the other on the diamond winner. In spades we are missing King-Jack-ten-eight-seven. So, we could have two trump losers unless we locate the spade honors correctly. The only way we will lose only one spades would be to have 3-2 spades distribution with @SKx on one side. We know that West has the @SK for sure.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bcaitlin: ^*N|cp||at|Back to our important prophecy: IF you need a card to be in a certain hand to make your contract, put it there. If you need a certain distribution of a card to be in such a way to make your contract, play for that distribution. Otherwise you are just giving up and going down. So let us play accordingly.|

SB|S|pc|SA|nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bcaitlin: ^*N|cp||at|Let us go through our A, B, C and D analysis. First is to analyze the opening lead of Spade Ace. @SA must be the top a doubleton--AK. So, we have to give West at least seven points. We have 27 points and if we evenly split the remaining thirteen points between East/West that leaves six points for East. |
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bcaitlin: ^*N|cp||at|Next step is to count the losers. We have no loser in clubs or diamonds. In spades we have two or possibly three losers depending on spades distributions. Now, if we lose three spades and lose a trump to @HK then we are set. Let us assume that we have three spade losers. Therefore we have to know the exact location of the @HK. That should help us avoid the fourth loss. Let us play a few rounds for now.|

^B@2^*Bcaitlin: ^*N|cp||at|This does not look good. This is the ninth spades and we have two left. Most likely East is going to ruff the spades. That is bad news good news. Because if East started with a doubleton spades then West must have started with @SAKxxx. Therefore, East should have the missing @HK. Otherwise West would have overcalled with @SAKxxx and @HK. Let us play and see more.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |

pg| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bcaitlin: ^*N|cp||at|Now we have to decide how to play the trumps so we can make the contract. We can either finesse and play the @HJ or @HQ to the Ace or plat the Ace first and go for the drop. First, we are almost sure that East has the @HK. So, finesse is out. On the other hand, we should put distribution as we need it to make our contract. If East started with @HKxx then everyone is down and we can do nothing about it. So, with all fingers crossed let us a small to @HA.|

^B@2^*Bcaitlin: ^*N|cp||at|Let us put our system to work. We are South and declaring a 4S contract. East has bid and probably has about 13 points. There are 23 HCPs for dummy and the declarer. So, West probably has three or four HCPs.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


AT| Next, let us analyze the lead. It must be  top of a sequence, however, that accounts for one of his HCPs. By the fact that East opened we know that most of the High Cards are with the East. It is now time to count our losers. |
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bcaitlin: ^*N|cp||at|There are two club, one heart, and probably one diamond losers. We have no spade losers. We cannot do much about the club and the heart losers. So, to make the contract, we should eliminate the diamond loser. On the other hand, we go down if @DQxx is with East--1 D, 2 C,  and 1 H. Nevertheless, let's explore because we are going to lose at least two club tricks. But keep track of the HCPs played by East.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |

pg| ***** 68 ***** |


at| That is 13.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


pc|HJ|at| That is 14. Do we think East started with @DQ--giving him/her 16 HCPs? No. With @DQ she/he would have 16 HCP and with a flat hand would have opened 1NT.|

^B@2^*Bcaitlin: ^*N|cp||at|So, let's put @DQ with West and play the diamonds. With this distribution, always play Ace here in case of singleton Queen.|

^B@2^*Bcaitlin: ^*N|cp||at|So, folks what have you learned today?|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


AT|   wyoming33: Count points and distributions.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


AT|
--Counting seems beyond so many of you as I often hear from you folks! Is it that hard to count ONE of opponent's hands? Always slow down and REVIEW BIDDING or LACK OF, ANALYZE the LEAD, COUNT ONE OPPONENT'S HAND, and COUNT your trumps. In this board we did not count our @H suit BUT we counted East's @HA and @HJ. |
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bcaitlin: ^*N|cp||at|With each of the hands we have looked at thus far, our play West for to hold  @SKx (Board 4), or East with trump @HKx (Board 5) has worked and these have been the only ways to make the contract.  On a bad day West will have the @SKxx and East the Kxx, but then there would be no way to make the contract and everyone else playing such hands will go down. And on Board 6, we counted and saw it was unlikely that East has the @DQ as that makes for a 1NT opener. Sure, East could have had 2 doubletons and thus not opened 1NT but playing West for the @DQ makes sense. |
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bcaitlin: ^*N|cp||at|Always give yourself the best chance and by counting one opponent’s cards, we will know all four hands. It won’t come to you overnight, but slow down and review the bidding or lack of and analyze the lead! I have commentated on BBO for many World Class events and these experts don’t play to the first trick quickly. Indeed it is rare that they play quickly. Remember it is OK to type in ‘thinking’ and if your opponents rush you, find new opponents to play against!

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bcaitlin: ^*N|cp||at|We will have  2 more lessons on counting HCPs and then four on COUNTING SHAPE in the next several weeks. Then YOU folks play and tell us why you are doing what:) |
