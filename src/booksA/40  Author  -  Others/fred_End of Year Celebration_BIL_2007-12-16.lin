qx|Introduction|
fp|1|cp||ht|f|at|@4BILMANAGER: 2007 was a milestone year for both Bridge Base Online (BBO) and the Beginner Intermediate Lounge (BIL). 
 
BBO had introduced BBOTV the forerunner of a full web version of BBO and in September BBO changed it’s corporate structure bringing on board a new Management Team.
 
The BILBridge website was launched on 26 August, giving the BIL an online Library in which to store lesson material and a place for these bridge movies to be accessible to current and future members.
 
On December 16, 2007 the BIL was proud to Host the BBO Management Team for a Special End of Year Celebration session. 
 
Our Guests were –
 
*FRED – Fred Gitelman – widely recognized as a one of the world’s top bridge players, he has been the winner of many prestigious events. Fred is special - his bridge programs have made a major difference for hundreds of thousands of bridge players. He has been active in promoting Junior bridge. He is a talented writer. He has served on many important bridge committees. He has coached some of America’s international team. In 2005 he was made the ACBL Honorary Member of the Year. Fred began his programming career at age 12! It was from Fred’s vision that BBO was conceived. |
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


ht|f|at|@4UDAY – Uday Ivatury – a programmer of extraordinary ability joined BBO in 2001 as the third member of BBO’s creative force. Uday too is a very good bridge player. In May 2007 he was ranked 7th in the Greater New York Bridge Association Player of the Year.  
 
Together with Fred’s wife *SHERI – Dr Sheri Winestock, they have created a unique online home for Bridge.
 
New to BBO Management 

*SHARONO – Sharon Osberg is a WBF World Master, winning the Venice Cup in 1991 and 1993 and has numerous other world class trophies. As well as her bridge acumen Sharon brings to BBO her management skills having retired from her role of Executive Vice President of Wells Fargo Bank. 
 
DAVIDS – David Smith became a bridge Lifemaster at age 18 but gave the game away to pursue a corporate career to become COO of a Fortune 500 Company before retiring in 1999. David particularly enjoys playing on BBO in ACBL tournaments with his 82 year old father.
 
The 5th member of the New BBO Team is Bill Gates who was unable to be with us on the 16th. He was ably represented by his friend and Sharono’s long time bridge partner.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


 
 
ht|f|at|@4TBONE – Warren Buffett, often called the "Sage of Omaha", a noted philanthropist and legendary businessman. Sharon has been his regular bridge partner for over ten years and playing bridge online is the primary reason that Warren agreed to have a computer installed in his house. He is considered to be an outstanding player.
 
For this session the hands were random dealt and the comments by the players SAYC based. For the first 8 hands *FRED did the commentary from the KIB box.


TBONE: Hi all, players and visitors!

SHARONO: Hi everyone! Warren (TBONE) and I don't have a convention card, so here's what we play: 5-cd majors, Flannery, 16-18 nt, intermediate jump shifts, std carding A/AK.

DAVIDS: Hi all ... :)

UDAY: Hi all!

FRED: Hello everyone and welcome! Special thanks to Maureen for organizing this event and to my friends and business partners for playing!

SHARONO: And thanks from us for such a GREAT site!!!!  And thanks to everyone watching.|

ht|f|at|@4Notes for the user:

In order to encourage the user to try to evaluate, bid and play every hand yourself a few features have been added:

   @2During the bidding only the actual hand (the one that is to bid) is displayed.

At the end of the auction only the hand of the leader is shown.

During the play you can see only declarer's hand (and dummy, of course).

You can display any hand at any time if you click on the player's name.
Double clicking the name will show all hands.

After the hand is played you can repeat it on your own playing all four hands, trick by trick.|

nt|FRED: An exciting hand to start with! 6@D is an attractive contract here, but not easy to bid. On the actual lie of the cards, 6@D will fail but it would take a heart lead, a losing finesse, and a spade switch for that to happen. That would be unlucky!|

DAVIDS: Something about blind squirrels comes to mind.|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|FRED: Sharon is a famous bridge player - she has won 2 World Championships and probably would have won more if she had not mostly "retired" from top-level bridge. The other 3 players are less well known as bridge players, but they are all very strong!|

sv|n|pf||nt|FRED: 4@S would make on a good day for EW, but today is a very bad day :). Diamonds are friendly, but the bad breaks in clubs and spades are a problem. Meanwhile, NS have a big heart fit. At first glance it appears there are only 3 losers in hearts so 4@H would make for NS.|

at| For those of you not familiar with David's 2@S bid, it is a "Michaels Cuebid" - showing 5+ hearts and 5+ of a minor. Probably both sides will keep on bidding...|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


sb|N|
sk|E|mb|3S|
nt|FRED: Warren stretched a little to bid 3@S - always a good idea to be careful with xxx of trumps, especially when the bidding suggests that things might not be breaking well...|

sk|S|sb|SThis one is awkward. Does P have the AH and strong Ds? More likely he has Cs, since I have so few.|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


sb|SBut it is tempting to think of slam, even though this is only 3 useful points. Too aggressive... so...|mb|4H|

nt|FRED: I have to admit that was a little disappointing... I was hoping Sharon would bid 4@S and then I was curious as to what would happen next.
SHARONO: In my youth I would have bid 4@S. Older and wiser now.
DAVIDS: I would have doubled.|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|FRED: Here the double would mean "in the context of the bidding I have good defense".
DAVIDS: Yes. I would bid Michaels with less defense.
FRED: The player who made a Michaels Cuebid can hardly be doubling on a trump stack...
But what would Uday do?|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|FRED: He has a lot more offense than he might have for a 4@H bid but he also has good defense with his QJ9x of spades and he has reason to believe that the @HA is probably not cashing - something he knows his partner won't suspect. Uday knows he has 6 hearts but David doesn't know that :). It is an especially hard hand for a new partnership... Established partnerships have agreements on the type of hands they would bid Michaels with...|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|DAVIDS: I think Uday would still be thinking... :)
UDAY: I can see that I should probably pass 4@S doubled but I don't think I could have refrained from bidding again.  I would have toyed with 4NT to see if partner happened to be able to show diamonds. In addition, I'm not totally sure, even looking at all the hands, that we can beat 4@S.
SHARONO: I don't think 4@S can make on any defense.|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|FRED: Agree, 4@S is down and maybe down a lot.
As with the first hand, once Uday has a "picture" of what David's hand looks like, it is easier for him to make the final decision. But on this particular hand, Uday, she has a tough problem in my view...|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|Q: Should you have 5 & 5 for Michaels Cuebid?
FRED: For me Michaels is always 5-5. Most experts agree, but some do not. It is a good thing to discuss with your regular partner.|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|Q: How would you know if David had @Ds by bidding 4 NT?
FRED: 4NT by Uday would mean "What is your minor?" - it could not logically be Blackwood in this auction (since Uday already signed off in 4@H). If Uday was 2344 for example, he would prefer to play in the 9-card minor suit fit at the 5-level versus the 8-card heart fit.|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt|UDAY: Partner will not assume I am bidding Blackwood, since I only bid 4H the last time. We both know that P has another suit and that I don't know what it is. Thus, I would hope that he would use the opportunity (on the way to 5H) to show his suit. He won't know why I am curious, and he won't care. Sometimes it might be better to play 5 of his suit (for instance, I might have had 3 hearts and 4-4 in each minor).|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


nt|Q: Why West didn't bid the 4@S? Even if it goes down 2 doubled it's still a better score.
SHARONO: I thought too much chance to go for a very large number when they can't make game... Uday doesn't have to have 6 hearts.|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt|Q: Is Michaels Cuebid alertable?
FRED: I think in ACBL Michaels is not an alert. But on BBO it can never hurt to alert - if you are in doubt you should alert.
DAVIDS: Yes.
BILMANAGER: In the BIL all artificial bids must be alerted and explained - *SHEP teaches that by alerting you are in compliance with the Rules, the Ethics and the Spirit of this great game.|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


nt|Q: How many points for Michaels?
FRED: Michaels is not really about points. And the type of hands you should bid Michaels with depends heavily on the vulnerability and partnership style. If not vul versus vul, you could easily bid Michaels with very few HCP (3 or 4) if you had a lot of distibution (like 6-6).|

sk|S|sb|SThis hand is slightly stronger than its high card point count would indicate.|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


sb|SI could upgrade it by a point and open 1NT showing 15.|mb|1N|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


sb|S|
at|FRED: Note Uday had "only" 14 HCP, but chose to open 1NT (15-17 in their non-partnership). It is common practice among experts to "upgrade" certain 14 HCP hands and open 1NT (same for certain 19 HCP hands and 20-21 2NT). The idea is that some 14 point hands are better than some 15 point hands.|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


nt|FRED: For example: @SA10x @HAx, @D10xx @CAQ109x. That hand has only 14 HCP, but it is a better hand than @SKJx @HKJxx @DQJx @CKJx (15 HCP). The 5-card suit, good spot cards, and lots of Aces make the first hand better than its point count suggests. The 2nd hand, with none of the above qualities, is worse than its point count suggests.
Q: Fred, would you downgrade the last example a point?|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


nt|FRED: Yes, I think I would open 1@C with the 2nd example, despite the 15 HCP - this is not something I do very often - it is much more common for me to "upgrade". But perhaps I am a natural optimist :).
Q: Is that legal?
FRED: It is legal, but if you do this frequently you should put 14+ to 17 on your convention card.|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |

nt|FRED: I spent most of that hand talking about Uday's decision to open 1NT despite holding only 14 HCP. What was your thinking in making that decision, Uday?
DAVIDS: He has seen me play the dummy before.
UDAY: Well. There is a great old book by  ^*iJeff Rubens^*n  called  '^*iSecrets of Winning Bridge^*n' (see ^*Hwww.bestwebbuys.com/9780486240763^*N).|
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


nt|UDAY: There he talks about how to evaluate high cards and honors. For instance, Axx Kxx Qxx Jxxx is weaker than AKx QJx xxx xxxx  even though both have the same points. So here, I upgraded because the honours were clustered together, supporting each other.|
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


nt|UDAY: A secondary reason was to shut out a spade overcall at the 1 level, or a club overcall at the 2 level (most people play 2@C as non-natural over a NT).
A final reason was that my hand seemed relatively rich in spot cards. All told, looking back I should not have upgraded, I think.  Upgrading on good 14 point hands puts a lot of pressure on partner if he is not expecting it.|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


nt|FRED: A good hand for 4-card majors - you would be happy to open 1@H with that hand.
SHARONO: I'm one of the last holdouts who really, really hate 14 pt no trumps, especially with no 5-card suit...|
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


nt|FRED: I wasn't really paying attention to the play, but it is often said that 1NT is the hardest contract both to play and defend...
SHARONO: Would have been much better if I'd led low spade on opening lead.
FRED: You had a tough hand to lead from - I would have considered a low diamond for my opening lead.|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


nt|SHARONO: I considered it for sure.
FRED: I tend to lead very passively when the bidding goes this way. But one of the advantages of leading from AK is you get to see the dummy and that will increase your chances of doing the right thing at trick 2. So I think Sharon's lead makes good sense - low diamond puts more of your eggs into one basket :).|
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


nt|Q: If Uday opened 1@D, how would the bidding go please?
FRED: It might have gone 1@D P P P :). Maybe Sharon would make a takeout DBL of 1@D. Some players would overcall 1@S with Sharon's hand, but I don't think Sharon is one of those players (me neither).|

sv|b|pf||nt|FRED: Both 3NT and 4@H are good contracts for NS here. Have a look at the @h suit - how would you play it as declarer? It depends partly on how many @h losers you can afford. If you can afford 1 but not 2 heart losers, cash a high card and then lead low toward the Jack - that guarantees only 1 loser unless the suit is 5-0. If you cannot afford any @h losers, you have to decide: either cash the AK (and hope the queen drops) or double finesse East for the Q and the 10.|

nt|FRED: Uday already told David that he had a 5-card heart suit. David's 3NT was a suggestion that 3NT might be best even though there is a known 5-3 heart fit. Uday had a very notrumpy hand given that he had already shown a 5-card heart suit so he judged to play for 9 tricks instead of 10 - good judgment by both players in my view. 4@H would have been ok too as it turns out.|
pg| ***** 128 ***** |


nt|Q: How do we conclude 5 carder hearts?
FRED: The 3@H bid suggested 5+ hearts. 

Another good auction David and Uday. Note that, besides the one artificial bid (2@C - 4th suit forcing) David and Uday had an entirely natural auction.|
pg| ***** 129 ***** |


nt|FRED: I predicted David's nice safety play in hearts while you were still bidding - well done :).
Q: I still don't see the purpose of the safety play, you lose the @HQ anyway if opponent has 3 hearts?
DAVIDS: If either opponent has Q10xx, I still make 4 heart tricks. 
I couldn't afford to play it that way at matchpoints.|
pg| ***** 130 ***** |


nt|FRED: If you cash the AK of hearts and someone has Q10xx, you lose 2 tricks in hearts. David's play guarded against Q10xx with either opponent. Serious players study these things - we call them "suit combinations" and there are entire books written about them. It is possible to figure out the best way to play most suit combinations at the table but it is easier for most people to learn them in advance via books or software.|

sk||mb|p|nt|FRED: 4@S is the 10 of clubs away from being a good contract... 3NT is actually better than 4@S and this time there is a 9-card major suit fit. In 3NT, all you need is to play spades for 6 tricks but in 4@S you need much more than that - there are 4 almost certain losers in the minors. 
I think the auction that Warren and Sharon had would be duplicated by many players.|
pg| ***** 141 ***** |


nt|Q: Fred, could you please explain the remark 'a 10@C away from a good contract'?
FRED: Yes, if either hand had the 10 of clubs, you would have a double finesse position available in that suit (and good chances to avoid more than 1 club loser).|

Q: How would bidding go to reach 3NT?

pg| ***** 162 ***** |


 
nt|FRED: In general it is good for new players to learn that it is sometimes right to play in 3NT despite holding an 8-card (or longer) major suit fit but I don't think now is the best time for you to be doing too much in the way of experimenting in this area :). There are too many other important things to learn.|

nt|FRED: And here is another suit combination that everyone will have to learn one day :). The percentage play in diamonds is to finesse twice - this is better than cashing the @DA on the first round. Sometimes inferences from the bidding would change things. For example, if there were only 12 HCP missing between the NS hands and E had opened the bidding, it would be a bad idea to take 2 diamond finesses.|

nt|FRED: I think we should get the Ivatury-Smith partnership playing on the tournament circuit :). They really communicate well in the bidding, despite having never played before

nt|SHARONO: I'm still talking about how happy I am this isn't for money.
FRED: Any questions about this hand?
Q: West made a DBL. When East gets in seeing the Axx in @S, why not lead a @S?
FRED: Hard for Warren to know at trick 2. Such things are only easy when you can see all the cards like us :).|
pg| ***** 197 ***** |


nt|Q: Why didn't Sharon bid her four card major instead of DBL?
SHARONO: Warren and I play that negative DBL shows four spades in that position.|
pg| ***** 198 ***** |


nt|Q: Why didn't West basically ignore the 1H overcall and bid @s?
FRED: Here Sharon's DBL is called a "negative double". It is a convention that shows exactly 4-cards in spades. If Sharon had 5 or more spades she would have bid 1@S instead. This is a good hand for the negative DBL because it made Warren's rebid (his Pass) easy. Knowing his partner had only 4 cards in spades, Warren knew he should not raise with only 3-card support.|
pg| ***** 199 ***** |


nt|Q: I get very confused with all the different kinds of doubles, any helpful hints?
FRED: Expect to stay confused - it is not so easy... But you can make some rules with your regular partnership. For example: all undiscussed doubles are for penalties. That is a useful sort of rule to have. Then you can decide which non-penalty DBLs you want to play. You already know about at least one of these I expect: the takeout double. Decide with your partner when it applies.|
pg| ***** 200 ***** |


nt|FRED: For example: "If they open the bidding below 4@H, then DBL by us is for takeout". It takes some work before you and your partner are usually on the same wavelength at the table. For beginners I suggest forgetting about learning any really fancy DBLs. Penalty, takeout, and possibly negative are all you need for now. If you don't have a regular partner, try to talk with your teacher or mentor about coming up with some good rules for when DBL means what.|
pg| ***** 201 ***** |


nt|Q: Should East have rebid his clubs to show that it was his suit rather than a better minor opening?
SHARONO: A free bid of 2@c in that position should show at least 6-card suit.
FRED: Often the best bid is Pass - Warren had nothing to say at his 2nd turn and that is exactly the message his Pass sent to his partner. He had already opened the bidding so he had no extra high card values in his hand. And he had no special distribution to mention either.|
pg| ***** 202 ***** |


nt|TBONE: I don't always stay quiet when I have nothing to say; only at bridge.
SHARONO: LOL!!
DAVIDS: Sharon could have bid 2@C ... but she might have missed spades that way.|

DAVIDS: Nice stop ... well judged.
SHARONO: Thanks for us. Easy decision for me... Warren did well.|
pg| ***** 224 ***** |


nt|Q: What is the correct lead?
FRED: I think that 99 players out of 100 would not consider any other lead than the @CK with Uday's hand. To Uday's credit, he is in the other 1%. But I suggest you leave all such thoughts out of your playbook until you have been playing this game for many years!|
pg| ***** 225 ***** |


nt|Q: Why double with 3 weak spades? 
FRED: I like Sharon's action - nowadays especially it is important to get into the bidding quickly on such hands. So many people open light, respond on nothing, and preempt in many auctions that, if you don't bid aggressively in response you are in danger of getting shut out of many auctions.|
pg| ***** 226 ***** |


nt|FRED: Also, when the opening bid is 1@C (as opposed to 1 of anything else) you can afford to be a little lighter for your takeout DBLs (because your partnership retains complete flexibility with respect to playing at the 1-level). If the opening bid had been 1@S instead, it would be much more dangerous to DBL with Sharon's sort of hand (because such a DBL forces partner to bid at the 2-level).|
pg| ***** 227 ***** |


nt|SHARONO: I once had a partner who said "Get as many suits in play as quickly as possible." Three cards, although bad ones, is enough for takeout double.
Q: How does one know the 3@c bid was a limit-raise?
UDAY: It was a pre-emptive raise. Most players play that jump raises after a takeout double are weak.|

nt|FRED: Another really well bid hand - good work NS!
Q: Please explain support double.
UDAY: You open something, partner responds 1H or 1S, and RHO overcalls.   A double by you shows 3 card support for partner. Another dangerous convention :). I suggest you don't play it until you see why you need it.|

nt|UDAY: Probably the trump lead wasn't our strongest start but it is a typical lead against this sort of auction.

Q: Why did Sharon not bid 2@H?
FRED: Wouldn't you like clubs more than hearts with Sharon's hand? :)|
pg| ***** 297 ***** |


nt|Q: With 2 unprotected J was really too strong for 1NT?
DAVIDS: Yes... way too strong for 1NT rebid. I could have 6 tricks in my hand if hearts break.

Q: Opener's 1NT rebid, does it promise balanced hand and or at least 2-card support for partner?
FRED: 1NT rebid is 12-14.|
pg| ***** 298 ***** |


nt|Q: Should one let opps have it for 2 when you are not vul? N/S make both 3@D and 3@S, don't you?
FRED: Yes - I was a chicken to sell out to 2@C :).

Q: What could you bid?
FRED: 2@D. Would be a gamble for sure, but the vulnerability was good for gambling :).|
pg| ***** 299 ***** |


nt|Q: If you DBL could partner pick your best suit?
FRED: I could DBL, but my hand is not good enough for that in my view. Too dangerous that Uday would Pass such a DBL and then be disappointed that my hand did not win a single trick :).|
pg| ***** 300 ***** |


nt|FRED: About opening 1NT with a 5-card major, this is a much debated issue, but it is not something for which there is a "right answer". There are many excellent players in each of the always/sometimes/never camps as far as this is concerned. Most important is for you and your partner/teacher/mentor to decide what you are going to do on such hands.|
pg| ***** 301 ***** |


nt|FRED: The downside of opening 1@H is that you are forced to rebid in a 3-card club suit as David did here. But you can see that does not have to work out badly :).
DAVIDS: By the way, I like to open 1NT with 5... but less concentrated values.|

pg| ***** 338 ***** |


nt|Q: I noticed that Uday led A from AK and that in an earlier hand Sharon lead K from AK. Could you explain your preferences?
FRED: It is a matter for each partnership to decide - the world is split close to 50-50 on that one.
SHARONO: We lead A/AK versus suits and K from AK versus NT. There isn't a right or wrong way to play.... up to you and your partner.|
pg| ***** 339 ***** |


nt|UDAY: An old article in ^*iThe Bridge World^*n suggested that the more likely you are to lead unsupported aces, the more strongly you should consider leading the K.
FRED: I think in USA nowadays there are more A-leaders than K-leaders, but in some parts of the world the reverse is true.|

fp|1|cp||ht|f|at|@4BILMANAGER: It was a privilege to have this opportunity for BIL members to meet with and learn so much from the BBO Management Team.

On behalf of the BIL members thank you  FRED, UDAY, SHARON, DAVID and WARREN  for sharing your time with us and we look forward to the changes 2008 will bring.

To get the most from this movie, compiled by MIKSA, I suggest you go through it time and time again – evaluate, bid and play every hand on your own.

   During the bidding only the actual hand (the one that is to bid) is displayed.

   At the end of the auction only the hand of the leader is shown.

   During the play you can see only declarer's hand (and dummy, of course).

   You can display any hand at any time if you click on the player's name.
   Double clicking the name will show all hands.

   After the hand is played you can repeat it on your own playing all four hands, trick by trick.|
