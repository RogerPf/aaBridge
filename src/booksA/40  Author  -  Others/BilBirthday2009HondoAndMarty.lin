^c@2^Z@3Marty A. Bergen (born 1948) is an American bridge player and writer. A 10-time national champion, American Contract Bridge League (ACBL) Grand Life Master, and World Bridge Federation (WBF) World International Master, he retired from active competition in 1993 to pursue his dream of becoming a bridge author (see story below).

Bergen is well-known for his innovative development of bidding conventions and treatments, including DONT and Bergen Raises. Together with his long-time bridge partner Larry Cohen, he popularized the Law of Total Tricks, Support Double, and 1NT Semi-forcing.

Marty has authored 22 bridge books, two of which won the American Bridge Teachers' Association's prestigious Bridge Book of the Year award, namely Points Schmoints!: Bergen's Winning Bridge Secrets in 1996 and Declarer Play the Bergen Way in 2005.  He has had a column in the Master Pointers section of ACBL Bridge Bulletin since 1976. Marty is also a panel member for The Bridge World's Master Solvers Club.

Marty's latest books are Slam Bidding Made Easier and Better Slam Bidding the Bergen Way (companion workbook), and he has just introduced the first four of his new Secrets to Winning Bridge booklet series:  Modern Doubles, 2/1 Game Forcing, 1NT Forcing, and Hand Evaluation.

Prior to becoming a full-time bridge professional in 1976, Marty earned his B.A. and M.A. in Education at the State University of New York.  He taught in public and private school systems in New York and Florida.  In addition to conducting bridge cruises, Marty now teaches and writes in Florida, where he lives with his wife Cheryl and dogs, Muffie and Casey.  In his leisure time, he is an avid sports fan (he played competitive tennis in high school/college) and loves watching his favorite teams compete.

CP||fp|2|ht|g|at|^c@2^Y@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :
^D* For beginner bridge players to escape to
^D* Where we could have teachers come and give lessons without interference from Advanced players
^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice
^D* For the beginner to go to and have one on one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions

In 2001/2/3  there was nowhere for that to happen and so in September 2003 Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began.

Nowadays there are lessons and tournaments  for BIL members to take part in every day of the year. All members can apply to have a mentor if they wish to do so and every endeavor is made to find one for them.  

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project – the BIL Library was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7 .  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum ( the Alfresco café) , to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^-|cs||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3Maureen: |CP||AT|To celebrate the 6th birthday of the  Beginner Intermediate Lounge (BIL), founded September 3, 2003, the members were treated to several outstanding Special Sessions by some of the World of Bridge’s  elite players throughout the month of September 2009--one of whom is Marty Bergen.|

AT|

- I have been trying to persuade Marty to play for the BIL for the past several years so it was something of a coup to have him finally agree to play with and against some of the BIL’s volunteers (a dedicated group of people who work tirelessly to keep the BIL’s schedule of daily events, material for the BIL Library, and much more  running smoothly 365 days of the year)  and to answer questions and comment on the bidding and play sharing with the BIL players some of his secrets for Winning Bridge.|

- The session is hosted by hondo717, Howard Schutzman, and I can see we already have over 160 or so kibitzers. Thank you, Marty, for helping to make this 6th  BIL birthday month a special one, it is a pleasure and privilege to have you share your winning bridge secrets with us. Also thank you, Howard, for hosting today and acting as Commentator and for all the time you give to the BIL players throughout the year. And special thanks to my brave volunteers who will take the "hot seats" today.|

I am sure that I speak for all BIL members when I express my gratitude to Maureen, Howard, and other dedicated teachers for their efforts in furthering our bridge skill. Further, I and the others, I am sure, were very nervous. It was as if we were playing tennis with Del Potro or golf with Tiger woods. Thrilled? Yes. Nervous? Extremely.

UP|25|NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Nice try, Opponents. Let me comment on the bidding first. West should not transfer to clubs. West should just make an invitation to 3N, by bidding 2C first and then bidding 2N. There is is no reason to show the clubs. If you play four-suit transfers, then the way you invite to 3N is you bid 2C, and then 2N. Many people will get to 3N, it is just that a purely invitational sequence is better.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|In this case the auction (leaving out N/S bids) could be 1N-2C (Stayman or invite)-2H-2N and either pass or 3N.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|First, let me comment on my partner's double. Kia, you do not really have a double because you do not have diamonds. Further, once I bid 2H, you should not raise to 3. 3@H shows a big hand, at least 17 or more points. Granted, you have 16 Dummy points using my counting system, but that is not enough, as I could have zero points.|

PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|East might have opened 1N to show his points. It was unlucky that the K of spades did not work out, but there was really no need to play it. I open 1NT sometimes with two doubletons, particularly, if the five-card suit is lower and you don't have enough to reverse. In this case 1N can sometimes be a good bid. My other point is that East should have played low on the second trick. I am sure Howard has taught you many times,"Second hand low." Okay on to the next deal and next group. Thank you, Partner, and Opponents.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|I like East bidding 3N with her very good hand. It turns out because of the bad placement of diamonds and spades not to work out, but it still should be bid. Having said that, had East bid 3N, I would have doubled. That double means that Roberta should lead dummy's first bid suit, diamonds in this case. I subtracted for the KJ of spades and the Jx of clubs and lack of quick tricks (only 1). I feel my hand was a collection of "schmoints" not points :).|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to the play. Roberta should not lead a club. The reason is that on the auction 1D-P-1N, responder usually has clubs, because she doesn't have hearts or spades and did not raise diamonds. Besides that, which is a general thing to know, on this particular hand, with 5 spades, a spade lead is clear. The 10 is the correct lead from Roberta's suit. |
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|And, the final point is a subtle one but interesting. I am sure you recall that I played the 10 of diamonds on the last diamond. Sometimes declarers lose track of suits, and in this way I might induce declarer to incorrectly play another diamond. On this hand it made no difference but on some hands it might, and there was no cost to the play.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|I like light 3rd seat openers, and my style is to open 1S, although pass is certainly very reasonable. East's balance was aggressive but reasonable. Roberta did a good job of giving count in diamonds, which was very important on this hand. When you think partner has the ace and there is a long suit with no entries, giving count is essential.|

NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|This hand was very hard for me to defend. Double dummy, we can get another trick if I realize that Roberta's hearts are that good. But I wasn't sure which cards Roberta had exactly, and I knew if she had the AQ of hearts, the hand was down 1.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, let me talk to West. West, you should do something over 3N. East is showing around 26 points. With your 7 that is 33 points. If you play 4C as Stayman, that is the bid. If no conventions, then just bidding 6N is fine. Just to review, my recommended auction is 2C-2D-3N-6N.|

NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Regarding my heart lead. I could lead the J which is the normal card. However, I was hoping to beat the hand, although not hopeful, so I did not want to waste the Jack, as there are some holdings for partner, like doubleton honor, where it does not work out.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|I have some comments on the auction. 1H is ok over 1C, but over 3C, East's hand is awesome. So East should push towards slam. East should appreciate what a great hand he has--2 Aces, three-card support (so nine-card suit), stiff spade, and a five-card suit. So, he should drive to slam, 4N, 6C, 4C, 4S splinter are all possible bids over 3C, assuming 4C is forcing.|

NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Now let me explain why I did not open a weak 2. I know your mentor, Howard, is the King of weak 2s. But let me give you a few pointers. In general, if you have more honors (3) outside your suit than inside your suit, that is a bad thing. Also, in 2nd seat, because first seat has passed, it is more likely you are preempting your partner. Further, with all due respect to my partner, here, I prefer having a good suit.|
