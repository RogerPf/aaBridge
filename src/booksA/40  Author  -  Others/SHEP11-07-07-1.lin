I would not open the S hand in first or second seat.  With a balanced hand, I like to have a hand worth 12 HCP.  This hand has 11 HCP, you could add a point for the 5th heart, but the @D Qx is not worth two points, making this hand worth more like 10 points than 12.  The Kaplan-Rubens Hand evaluator says this hand is worth 9.75 points. |

The Kaplan-Rubens Hand evaluator is a program you can run with your browser that will evaluate hands.  You can find it at ^*Hwww.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi^*N and an explanation of how it works at ^*Hwww.gg.caltech.edu/~jeff/knr.txt^*N  I use this to check my hand evaluation after the game to see how well I did.  Of course, it is not allowed to use it during play. |

In 3rd seat, however, we often open light hands.   The reasons for this are:

-- We make the bidding harder for the opponents and they could reach the   wrong contract.
-- We might find a fit to fight the part-score battle.
-- We might help to get partner off to a good opening lead. |
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


mb|d|Nt|
West has 11 HCP and 3+ in support of the 3 unbid suits, so makes a takeout dbl of 1@H.  This is a light action, but since East is a passed hand, he won’t likely be jumping to game, so they can fight for the part-score. |
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


mb|2H|NT|
North raises to 2@H.  He has 9 HCP and 1 point for the doubleton club to give him 10 Dummy Points (DP). |
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


mb|d|Nt|
East has enough points to be competing but is not sure which strain to play.  He could bid 3@C, but I would recommend a takeout double.  The jargon for this dbl is “Responsive Dbl” and it usually shows a hand that can play in at least 2 strains.  The 4333 shape is not ideal for this bid, but it seems better than bidding a weak 4-card suit at the 3-level. |
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


mb|p|mb|2S|Nt|
Opener passes, and West bids 2@S, ending the auction.  North should not bid again because he has a flat hand, and only 3 hearts.  To compete on to the 3-level it is usually best to have a 9-card fit. |

The opening lead is @H 9, top of nothing.  |
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


AT|
Declarer makes a plan.  The losers are 1 spade, 3 diamonds and 2 clubs, possibly a club ruff.  If the @D A is in the S hand that will avoid a diamond loser.  Drawing trumps is the first priority, so they can’t ruff our high card winners. |
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


AT|
Declarer also has to decide whether to play @H J or @H 2 from dummy at trick one.  If the lead is from the @HQ, the @H J will win and later the @H K will provide a discard for a loser.  However, the @H 9 lead is very unlikely to be from the Queen.  Best is to play @H 2 so that South can’t attack hearts if he gets the lead. |
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hA|NT|
After winning the @H A declarer plays a small spade to the @S K and @S A.  South can’t return a heart and can see no advantage in playing another round of trumps, since that is what declarer thinks is good for his side.  I would play @D Q here, hoping to set up tricks in partner’s hand if he has @D KJ, or to get a diamond ruff if partner has @D Axx(x) and another entry. |

The @D Q is covered, North winning @D A, cashing @D J and leading his lowest diamond for South to ruff.  The low diamond asks for a club return, so the defense now takes @C A, @C K and a club ruff.  After this declarer has the rest.  2@S is down 2, 100 points to N/S. |

Whether this is a good score for EW depends on how NS would do in 2@H.  There, they lose 2 spades and 2 hearts.  South’s 3rd club can be ruffed, and the hearts are well situated for NS.  By competing to 2@S, EW are -100 instead of -140.  That is pretty well an average score for IMPs, the difference would be more important at MP. |

S opens 1@D in 2nd position and W has to decide whether or not to overcall.  The suit is mediocre, and the values are at a minimum.  However, the vulnerability is right for a light overcall, and the diamond holding is good.  What you have in opener’s suit is a key factor in close decisions to overcall.  If the lead of their suit will help you, it is something to consider.  A diamond lead up to his @D Kx is positive, so I’d go with the light overcall.  The worst thing you can have in their suit is three small or three to the Q or J. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


mb|1N|mb|2S|
mb|d|nt|
With 8 HCP and @S QJ85 North responds 1NT, East raises to 2@S and South has to consider his next move.  S has 16 HCP, a point for the 5-card diamond suit, and can add another point for the 4th club.  Not all say to add a point for a second 4-card suit, but it reflects the fact that you have better trick-taking potential with a 5-4 hand than with 5332. |
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


AT|
KR gives the S hand 18.45 total points, counting for the distribution and adding a little for the @D 1098.  Since the opponents bid and raised spades South’s dbl is for takeout and also promises extra values. |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


mb|p|mb|p|NT|
After West passes, North must decide what to do.  Pass, 2NT and 3@D are all possibilities.  I passed because it seems easier to take 6 tricks in my best suit than to take 9 in another.  There is no guarantee of game, so down 2 is enough to win the board. |

N leads a diamond in response to the opening bid.  From xxxx I like to lead 2nd highest, leading 4th best only if I have an honor.  There is no right or wrong about which card to lead from this holding… all that really matters is that partner knows what you are up to. |
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


at|
Declarer’s plan – Losers are 3 clubs, 1 diamond (because pf the lead), 3 hearts and at least 1 spade.  He does not waste any time berating himself for the overcall… that can come later.  For now the task is to do as well as he can here. |

If North has @C A that will reduce the club losers to 2.  Perhaps the defense will avoid playing clubs until the 4th heart can be set up to discard a club. |
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


AT|
S wins the @D A and cashes @H K to tell partner that he has @H AK, and then returns @D Q, neutralizing dummy’s @D J.  On this 2nd round of diamonds, N plays his 4th best.  If he had started with xxx he would lead top and then follow with the middle card. |
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|s3|NT|
There is no reason to put off playing trumps.  South’s Dbl was for takeout and when N passes that places him with strong trumps.  That is confirmed by the 1NT bid over the 1@S bid.  |
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


AT|
Declarer leads a small spade towards dummy.  North should play low, hoping declarer will misguess or misplay trumps.  Declarer does the right thing by playing @S 9 which wins.  |
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


pc|sK|pc|d8|pc|s4|pc|s8|NT|
He now plays @S K and @S A.  Next he plays a low club towards dummy, the King winning, and another club to his ten and North’s @C A.  North plays a heart, South taking @H J and @H A.  Next he takes the @C Q and declarer still has to lose the high trump, down 2.|

Some NS pairs bid and made 3NT, while two others bid it but went down one.
On a spade lead, 3NT should fail, on a heart lead it should make.  North’s decision to defend leads to an average result. |

|NT|
South opens 1@H and N should immediately think of getting to slam.  This would be a good hand for a strong jump shift to 3@H followed by a heart raise.  However, many of you play weak jump shifts, 2/1 or Bergen style raises so that the strong jump shift is not available so I will show you an auction starting with 2@C. |
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


mb|p|mb|2C|
mb|p|mb|2D|NT|
Opener rebids 2@D.  With 6-4 distribution I strongly suggest that you show your second 4-card suit before repeating your first suit.  Suit A, Suit B, Suit A … this sequence shows 6 in A and 4 in B.  |
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|NT|
In SAYC, after opener’s 2@D rebid, 2@H could be a minimum 2-level response with doubleton heart preference, so responder should jump to 3@H.  This bid is forcing to game, and shows a better hand than a jump to game.  Opener should cue bid his cheapest control by bidding 3@S. |
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


at|
In the modern style, we cue bid first or second round controls up the line.  The idea is to use these cue bids until one of us knows that all the side suits are under control (the opps can’t take 2 fast tricks in any one suit and then use Roman Key Card Blackwood to find out if the defense has two key cards.  |
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


mb|p|mb|4C|NT|
3@S is an encouragement to North, but he must not bid RCKB yet.  It is possible, if the partnership is missing one key card, that the defenders could take @C AK, and so he should cue bid 4C to see if opener can show a diamond control. |
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


mb|p|mb|4D|NT|
After 4@C, opener bids 4@D.  He could bid 4NT, but is not sure how strong his partner’s hand is, so he can show the control and let his partner take charge.  North asks for key cards and when S shows 3 he should take time to count winners. |
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5D|NT|
North can tell they have 5 hearts, 5 clubs, 1 spade and 1 diamond for 12 top tricks.  If opener has @S K or @D K or a 6th heart that will give them 13 tricks.  If none of those cards are there, it could still be possible to make 13 tricks via a squeeze.  The general wisdom is that when you can count 12 sure tricks, you can take the risk to bid the grand slam, so North does that. |

pg| ***** 57 ***** |


pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s4|Nt|
West leads @S J looking for a safe choice.  Perhaps a trump would have been better although it does not matter on this deal.  Since clubs divide 4-2 and opener has 6 hearts there are 13 top tricks.|

West opens 1@D, and North considers whether to make a takeout dbl.  It is often OK to double with 10 HCP and perfect shape (4441) as that gives you 13 DP in support of all 3 unbid suits.  This hand does not meet the requirements because the@ D Qx in their suit is not worth anything, leaving you with just 9 HCP. East responds 1@S next. |
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


mb|1S|
mb|p|mb|2C|Nt|
Opener rebids 2@C, and East has to decide what to do next.  He has 7 HCP, and can count 3 points for the length in hearts (1 each for the 5th, 6th and 7th hearts)  You could also count 1 point for the 4th club.  The Kaplan-Rubens Hand evaluator gives this hand 11.45 points.  I would reduce that by a bid because of the void in opener’s diamond suit, but it fits within the 10-12 point invitational range. |
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


mb|p|mb|3S|NT|
I would choose to bid spades rather than raise clubs because of the 7-4 shape.  The old saying is “7-card suits don’t belong in dummy”.  Suppose the defense can make the dummy ruff early in the hand.  There might not be a late entry to take your spade tricks.  It’s almost always best to play in your 7-card suit.  Since the range is 10-12, the bid is 3@S, inviting partner to game. |
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|NT|
Opener rejects the invitation by passing 3@S.  Going on to 3NT because you are short in spades is a big mistake, you won’t have the communication to make it. |
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


pc|cK|NT|
S decides to lead his singleton @C K, hoping to get some ruffs.  Declarer wins this in dummy, and must get to his hand to lead trumps.  I would lead a heart towards the King.  You have to get that trick set up eventually, so might as well lead it now.   |

The @H K wins and declarer should try the @S K.  He wants to keep North’s entries for club ruffs to a minimum; if North has @S A he has to win with that, but at least he’s not getting an entry with a smaller card.  North wins @S A and leads @C 8 for his partner to ruff.  Since the @C 8 is the biggest card North can afford, it asks partner to return a heart rather than a diamond.  |

pc|hJ|NT|
S leads @HJ so North does not need to guess whether to play the @H A or 10 from A10x(x).  North knows that his partner can take another club ruff, since clubs are 4441, so he overtakes the @H J even though declarer ducks in dummy to play back another club.  He had read about this play in a book.  Unfortunately this was the wrong time for the play … the result was that S ruffed declarer’s club loser with his high spade. |

North has a classic weak 2@S opener – a good 6-card suit with a side King.  Although I advise not to have Aces and Kings outside your suit for 3- and 4-level preempts, there is nothing wrong with having one for a weak 2.  Consider that the weak 2 opener is a blend between the 1-level and 3-level openers. |
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


mb|d|Nt|
East has to decide between Dbl and 3@C.  Either bid is technically correct, the clubs are good enough to bid, and with 3+ support for all 3 unbid suits the double is also OK.  I would choose the Dbl because it is the most flexible.  You can still play in clubs after the Dbl, but you will have a hard time finding a heart or diamond fit after the 3@C.  |
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


mb|4S|NT|
South should raise to 4@S even though he is vulnerable.  It is up to the opener to check the vulnerability before he chooses to open 2@S.  Responder should be able to raise based on shape, regardless of vulnerability. |
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


mb|5H|Nt|
West does not know which side is making a contract at this level, but the singleton spade and the 6-card heart suit would entice me to bid 5@H.  When there is a lot of shape around the table, bidding one more works more often than choosing to defend. |

Declarer’s plan:  Losers are 1 spade, 2 diamonds and 1 club.  If they do not switch to a diamond the contract will make as both diamond losers will go away on the club suit. |
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s8|NT|
On the @S K opening lead, South signals with the @S 8.  Since the dummy has a singleton spade it is unlikely that the defense should continue that suit.  If you assume that South is signaling what his partner needs to know, the @S 8 is a suit preference signal to help North decide which suit to lead next. |

As it turns out NS will go down in 4@S as long as the defense plays clubs before the @DA is knocked out.  They will lose 2 hearts, 1 diamond and 1 club.  Did West make a mistake bidding 5@H?  He ended up -100 instead of +100.  Even so, I don’t think 5@H was a mistake.  |
