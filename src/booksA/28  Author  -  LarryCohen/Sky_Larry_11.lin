mb|d|nt||ht|c|at|Partner doubles. What does this show? |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|On this specific auction, partner guarantees at least 4-4 in the majors. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|If he had only one major he would have bid it (promising only 4 cards there). |

pg| ***** 36 ***** |


hc|c5|nt||ht|c|at|You play a club from dummy |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


lc|c5|pc|cc|at|and RHO plays low. |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|This is the moment of truth. |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|What do you play? |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


hc|cj|nt||ht|c|at|In general, when faced with this guess, I put in the jack.  |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


lc|cj|nt||ht|c|at|Most RHO's either grab the ace if they have it, |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


at|or at least think about grabbing it. |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


at|So, when they play low smoothly, |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


at|I assume the ace is on my left-which is why I put in the jack. |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|But here, I have a clue from the bidding. East raised to 2@D.  |
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


at|On what?  I don't think he would make that bid (vulnerable, no less) with only the @DQ and @CQ. I expect he has the @CA for his bid. |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


hc|ck|nt||ht|c|at|So, you should put up the @CK  |
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


lc|ck|pc|ckc|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


at|and as you can see, you make your contract. |
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


sk|y|nt||ht|c|at|At other tables, no doubt, East will hop with the @CA and make it much easier on declarer.
