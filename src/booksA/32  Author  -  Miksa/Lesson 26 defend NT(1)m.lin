nt|This is the crucial moment of the hand. Have a break for some thinking:
Who has the @hQ?|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


at| Declarer for sure, because partner's K denied the Q. 

REMEMBER: ^*b Always play the lowest from touching honors.^*N|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|How many @hs declarer has got?|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at| From the bidding is clear, he had 4 at most. But had he 4 or 3? Will the Q come down on the next trick or not?|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at| This question would be a pure guess if you have no convention about count-signals in this situation:

^*bThird hand returns the highest from original 3 cards and low from original 2 or 4 cards.^*N|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


Nt|Partner returned the 8. There are missing Q, 9 and 2. So it is 100% sure that partner started with 3 @hs and declarer with 4. Therefore, you must duck this trick expecting partner to return the suit, else you are limited to 3 tricks in the suit.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at| But wait a moment. Is it possible that partner has another quick entry?|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt|Let us count HCPs: Dummy 12 + myself 6 = 18. Declarer showed 12+ HCPs (see the 2NT alert), so partner has space for up to 10 HCPs. You may lose overtricks by ducking, but

This is the crucial moment again. What do you do? Take the J and continue with A or hold up?|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


at|
It depends on how many @hs declarer has.|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


Nt|There are 2 reasons why declarer cannot have 4 @hs:|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


At|
1) Declarer's 2@d answer to CBS-question denied 4 @hs.|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


at|
2) Partner's @h2 shows that he started with 4 cards in the suit.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


at|
So there is no doubt that you should cash your 5 @h tricks at once.|

pc|H5|nt|After the normal lead of the 4th best @h, have a break for some thinking. Always use the time declarer needs to make his plan to analyze the hand and make yours.|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|From the bidding you know:
1) Declarer has 15-17 HCPs, so partner has 4-6 HCPs.
2) Declarer has no 4-card major, so his distribution is 3343 or 3244 or 3235 with 7 cards in the minors at least.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|Now first let us hope partner has got @hK.|

at| Nope.|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


pc|C9|pc|C6|pc|C2|pc|CK|
at| There is no point to hold up, so take the trick. BUT what now? 
a) Cash the @hs hoping declarer started with Kx or
b) Hope that partner has @dA or
c) Hope that partner has @SK and declarer only 6 minor-suit tricks.|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt|This would be a difficult guess if you have no agreement with partner about the meaning of his @h3.
^*bIf you lead low and dummy wins the trick with a low honor, partner gives count! ^*N
Therefore the @h3 says: partner has got an odd number of @hs.
So you can play the A beeing 100% certain that declarer started with Kx.|

pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt|In this situation partner throws the ^*b same card ^*N he would return if he had gained the first trick.
So the @h3, which is apparently his lowest, shows he started with an even number of @hs (4 in this case). 
You are pretty sure declarer started with KJ.|

Partner denied the @s10 but may have the Q. Declarer could have the Q. But that is very improbable, after you saw him taking the A. You can be 99% sure the Q is with your partner.|

{Rule 1 
Third hand plays high (exceptions if dummy shows a middle honor).}

{Rule 2
Third hand plays the ^*b lowest ^*N from touching honors.}

{Rule 3
Third hand gives count if dummy wins the trick with a middle honor.}

{Rule 4
If third hand wins the first trick, he shows the number of cards by his return.
He returns his originally 4th best, if he started with 4+ cards.
He returns the highest, if he started with 3 cards originally.}

{Rule 5
If third hand didn’t win the first trick, he later gives count discarding the card in that suit he would have returned if he had won the first trick (using Rule 4).}|
