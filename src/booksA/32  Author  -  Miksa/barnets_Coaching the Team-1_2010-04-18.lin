at|   @2^z@3Maureen Hall |fp|2|at|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO:

^b· Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players.

^b· Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice.

^b· For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project - the BIL Library - was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

at|^d@2^z@3Barnet Shenkin |fp|2|at|(barnets on BBO) was born in 1950 in Glasgow, Scotland, into a bridge-playing family. It was at the age of 13 that he first went to Albert Benjamin's club. Without knowing what stakes were involved, he ended the session by being given 7/6d, untold riches for a 13 year old in those days.

He worked for many years in the family business, buying and selling rugs, but his main interest has always been bridge.

He burst on to the bridge scene as a junior, with a remarkable run of success. He was the youngest player of that era to win The Scottish Cup, the main Scottish Championship and The Gold Cup, the most important event in UK bridge. 

He later formed a successful partnership with Michael Rosenberg and together they were both the youngest pair to both play in, and win, the Sunday Times (Macallan) International Pairs, the most prestigious event of that time. Barnet was 25 and Michael 21.

As well as winning a large number of National Championships in both Scotland and the UK, Barnet represented both Great Britain and Scotland with 6 different partners playing several hundred International matches.

In 1997 Barnet decided to move to USA to concentrate on playing, writing about and teaching Bridge.

Since moving to USA he has won 3 National Championships and many Regionals. He had a second place finish in the Vanderbilt Teams, and the US team trials, a third in the Reisinger and reached the semi–finals of the Spingold.

Barnet has played for the USA in several World events and finished 5th in the Rosenblum World Championship in Verona in 2006.

Now living in Boca Raton, Florida, he is a very successful player focusing on teaching players to improve their game.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


ht|d|at|@4^d@2^z@3As a writer he has written for the ACBL Bulletin and Sunshine Bridge News. In the year 2000 his book Playing With the Bridge Legends was published by Masterpoint Press.

As a teacher and lecturer Barnet is presently working on new 'Power Teaching Programs'. His original presentation "Put Yourself in the Hot Seat" has been well received.

Zia Mahmood says: "I first met Barnet when he was a 'normal person,' a successful businessman with a bridge habit. I would like to think I could take part of the credit for helping him to see the light and convert to being a full-time bridge-bum who left the friendly pastures of Scotland for the savage fields of bridge at the top in America."

Maggie Shenkin, Barnet’s wife, won the Scottish Cup with Barnet in 1994. Also a winner of the Portland Pairs with Richard Benstead. She travels with him, and they played together in the Mixed Pairs at the World Open Championships in 2002 and 2006 and in the European Open Championship in 2007.
 
We are indeed fortunate to have him as our Special Guest this month.|

ht|f|fp||at|^d@2barnets: |fp|2|at|The topic today is "Coaching the Team".

This year I spent some time coaching a team of intermediate players who play in a competitive league. I found discussing the hands they played in that league to be both interesting and useful to give ideas to improve their game. I had the opportunity to say what I would have done when faced with their problems.

Lets look at the first deal.|

When the suit lies well, H10 are two tricks. When it lies badly you hope to take out all the opponents loose cards and then lead the H from H10x or lead up to the H10x and play the H.|

at|Partner knows you have a singleton with your lead. He is telling you how to reach his hand. This is called a suit preference signal. A high diamond shows possession of an entry in the high suit. A low diamond would be an entry in a low suit.

up|52|nt||fp|2|at| barnets: @2Any questions on this deal? Do we understand the logic? You need to visualise more than just the first trick how to defeat the actual hand. With the trump ace you just need to find partner with an entry. @0|
at|
 Kibitzer: @2I'm missing a piece. You lead @D to show a singleton, then when opponents return @D, partner signals with @D10 to show high spade? @0|
at|
 barnets: @2You have asked a good question. This is an important point. When partner leads a card and both you and your partner know that that is a singleton, then it is your job to show your partner where your entry lies so you can get in later and give her a ruff. @0|
pg| ***** 96 ***** |


nt||fp|2|at| Kibitzer: @2North was supposed to play high as third seat in @D lead - how could South take it as asking for lead in higher suit? @0|
at|
 barnets: @2Let's imagine dummy had the @DAK. Then a high @D like the @d10 would show a spade entry and a low @D like the @d2 or @d3 would show a club entry. So when partner wins the trump ace she knows how to get you in for her ruff. @0|
at|
 Kibitzer: OK - preference is hard.
 barnets: @2It is hard, but very important for all advancing players. And not so hard when you get used to it. It can come like second nature.|
pg| ***** 97 ***** |


nt||fp|2|at| Kibitzer: With Partner's jump to 3@S, wouldn't you think already that they had the K@S?
 barnets: @2Yes, you would, and that was your idea with your lead but when partner plays the @D10 and the 9 is on table and you led the 8 you know she did not need to play the 10 so it must be a signal in case you were sleeping. Sometimes you have to wake up a sleepy partner! @0|
pg| ***** 98 ***** |


nt||fp|2|at| Kibitzer: Would it be deceptive from declarer to play @d9 (mudding the signals)?
 barnets: @2Well, declarer could play the 9 and partner would play the 10 here. But good question, because if partner held the @CA and not the @SK she would not play the @D10 but the @D3. Can everybody understand that point? @0|
at|
 Kibitzers: Yes.
 barnets: @2Great, then you all have learned something today. 
North assumes East has 5 diamonds, but partner would never lead declarer's first suit without a singleton.|

pg| ***** 133 ***** |


nt||fp|2|at| Kibitzer: How to determine when to lead trumps?
 barnets: @2That is a good question. When the opponents are stretching and have probaby not the values for game and when they are likely to need ruffs, then a good lead is from Axx as you can take two more trumps out if you get in later.
When the opponents have bid two suits and they could be running and you have no trump stopper, then you must be active with your lead. @0|
pg| ***** 134 ***** |


nt||fp|2|at| Kibitzer: Active means cash your winners?
 barnets: @2Active lead is to try and take or set up your winners before they get theirs. 
Passive is to try and give away nothing on the lead. 6NT for example usually calls for a passive lead.|

mb|P6N|
at|When North bids 2NT I think 6NT with the South hand is a reasonable shot. South's points are concentrated and while the HCP says 18, I value it at 20+. The @D10 is a great card that almost guarantees 5 diamond tricks.|

 BS: @2When the diamonds split 3-3 or 4-2 (almost 80% of the time) you have 12 sure winners by conceding a diamond to the K. You are twice unlucky. First the diamonds broke badly and your opponents (at the other table) bid badly!

at|You need to trust me that in the long run if you bid to the correct contract you will win more points than you lose. 
In Scotland, a bridge player only concerned with the result on a board and not the correct contract or correct play was known as a "result merchant". 
Don't be a result merchant.|

pg| ***** 150 ***** |


nt||fp|2|at| barnets: @2I know some play weak jumps. Not my choice. If you were playing weak jumps, you would have to bid 1@D and over 1@H bid 1@S as fourth suit forcing because 3@D is non forcing. Then when partner bids 2@S you could bid 3@D, now forcing. @0|
pg| ***** 151 ***** |


nt||fp|2|at| Kibitzer: How is 2NT in this auction valued?
 barnets: @22NT is a special kind of waiting bid here. If you play strong jump shifts, you don't bid a second suit unless you have 5 of them, and should not rebid your own suit wihtout 6. This system was instigated by the late Paul Soloway. So here you would rebid 2NT waiting to find out what kind of jump shift partner has. If you were playing this system, 2NT should be alerted. @0|
at|
 Kibitzer: Then if North bids 2@H vs NT, that would be a reverse?
 barnets: @2It would not be a reverse, 2@H could either systematically show 5 hearts or be a waiting bid.|
pg| ***** 152 ***** |


nt||fp|2|at| Kibitzer: This bidding makes strong hand dummy, is this a problem?
 barnets: @2South would be more worried who was playing it if partner had not opened 1@C, to protect her Kx club.
But you are right, that it is an advantage for the strong hand to play the contract - that is why 2@H waiting bid may be best, if you would like to play it.|
