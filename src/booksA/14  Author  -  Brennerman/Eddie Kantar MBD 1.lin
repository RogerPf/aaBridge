  Chapter 1

  Leading against NT   
  }
^-

|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3The bidding is over, the opponents have landed in NT and it's your lead.

What should you be thinking about - and which suit and which card in that suit should you lead?|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|

And don't tell me you are going to lead fourth highest from your longest and strongest suit no matter how the bidding has gone.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


at|

What if the opponents have bid your longest suit?|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|

What if your longest suit is so scrawny that you can barely bear to look at it?|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


at|

What if your partner has bid?|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


at|

Maybe you should lead partner's suit instead of your own...especially if you value your life.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


at|

In this chapter you are given some tips on deciding which suit to lead.

Then, once the suit is selected, which card to lead.|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


at|

After all, leading the proper card is almost as important as leading the right suit.|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


at|

Your leads are supposed to tell partner what you have in the suit so partner can decide whether that suit is worth pursuing.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Most NT contracts basically evolve into a race: a race to set up and cash tricks.|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


at|

The defense is trying to set up enough tricks to defeat the contract, while the declarer is racing to set up enough tricks to make the contract.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


at|

Who will win?

The declarer usually has the preponderance of high card strength, but that is balanced by the head start the defenders have: the opening lead.|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


at|

It is safe to say that if you could peek at your partner's hand before you made the opening lead, you would be a World Champion ten times over|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


at| even if you are no more than an average player.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


at|

That's how important the opening lead is.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |

Picking the right suit to lead
^-|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


fp||at|^B@2^Z@3Here are some of the factors to consider before making your opening lead.

If you can just pick the right suit, you will be off to a flying start.|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


at||fp|3|at|^-

Partner has bid
^-|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


fp||at|
Whenever partner bids a suit, you have to give some consideration to leading that suit, particularly an overcalled suit.|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


at|

Overcalled suits tend to be reasonably strong five or six card suits.

Indeed, many overcalls are made with one thought in mind: to direct the opening lead.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


at|

Let's go to the table.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt||ha|y|tu||st||sv|0|rh||ah|Chapter 1|ah|Leading Against NT|pn|Declarer,You,Dummy,Partner|bg||st||nt|^B@2^Z@3Consider your leads in the following situations.|

nt|^B@2^Z@3It would be insulting not to put a Spade on the track.|

Partner has opened in third seat
^-|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


fp||at|^B@2^Z@3Third seat openings with a strong suit can be a trifle light in HCP.

They might even be made with a strong four-card major playing five-card majors! |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


ht|j|at|^B|



ih|
sAKJThK4d9432cT87|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


at|

This is a possible (some would say mandatory) third seat 1@s opening bid. Why?|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


at|

First you can pass any response partner makes so you don't have to worry about getting 
too high.|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


at|

Second, if the opponents play the hand, you encourage a Spade lead.|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


at|

Therefore, if partner opens third hand and the opponents fly into game, there is a good chance that partner has opened light to direct your lead.|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


at|

Don't cross partner's intentions unless you have a strong suit of your own.|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


bt||bg|3|nt||fp|3|at|^-
Partner could have doubled an artificial bid
^-|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


fp||at|^B@2^Z@3Before landing in a NT contract, your opponents may go through a Stayman, Jacoby Transfer or "fourth suit" sequence.|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


at|

These all entail artificial bids and an experienced partner, like yourself, will be on the alert to double any of these bids with suitable high card length and strength.|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


at|

If partner is the one that can double and doesn't that's a clue too.|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |

pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3South is showing 5 Hearts and North figures to have 4 Spades so a major suit does not  look appetizing.|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


at|

What about a minor? Is it a guess? Not entirely.|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Partner did have a chance to double 2@c and didn't, so your best choice is a Diamond.|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |

You have a weak five-card suit
and a strong four-card suit
^-|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


st||bg||fp||nt|^B@2^Z@3No law on the books states you must lead your longest suit.

Common sense may dictate otherwise.|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


st||bg||nt||md|,t7432hkjq9d94cq6|mb|1cp1dp1np2np3n|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Surely it  must be right to lead a Heart.|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


bt||bg|3|nt||fp|3|at|^-
You have two suits of about equal length
^-|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


fp||at|^B@2^Z@3When you hold two suits of equal length and relatively equal strength, one a major and one a minor, lead the unbid ^*imajor.^* |
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


at|

Of course, as you will see all things are not equal.|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


nt||st||bg||md|,qt64ha8dqt64c954|ha||mb|1np3n|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Here, a Spade is a better shot than a Diamond because the dummy did not use Stayman.|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


at|

It is unlikely that dummy has a four-card major which means dummy has length in either one or both minors.|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Modern bidding systems lean toward finding an eight-card (or longer) major-suit fit.

If major suits aren't bid or inferred (see the next example) it is safe to lead an unbid major.|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


ub|3|nt|^B@2^Z@3Say you have the same hand but this time the bidding has gone:|nt||mb|1np2cp2hp3n|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3This is a different ball game. Even though Spades is not a bid suit, dummy is known to have four Spades, or else why use Stayman?|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


at|

This time a Diamond is the better choice.|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |

pg| ***** 69 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3In general, it pays to lead from your stronger suit because it is easier to establish. Lead a Spade.|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


at|

Exchange your black suits. Now your hand looks like this:|
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


nt||md|,83hq952dk45ctk36|mb|1np2n|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3You have to decide between your Clubs, a minor, and your weaker suit, Hearts, a major.|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


at|

If your minor suit contains an honor sequence or any 3 honor cards, lead the minor, if not, lead the major. In this case stick with a Heart.|
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


bt||bg|3|nt||fp|3|at|^-

^-|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


nt||st||bg||md|3,kt643ha8632dt6c9|mb|1np2np3n|
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


ha|y|nt|^B@2^Z@3In close situations, tend to lead the suit that does ^*inot^*  have the ace; here a Spade.|
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


at|

The reason is that you are hoping to set up those Spades knowing you have an entry in case you do set them up, the ace of Hearts.|
pg| ***** 78 ***** |

Opponents' bidding suggests that a long suit
is about to be rammed down your throat
^-|
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


ha||nt||st||bg||md|3,j7432h987d4qckq8|mb|1dp1hp3dp3n|
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3The bidding, plus your death holding in Diamonds, indicates that an attacking lead is called for.|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


Nt|^B@2^Z@3When the opponents are likely to have a running six or seven card suit, strong short suit leads from A K x or K Q x or even A Q x, take precedence over longer, weaker, suits.|
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


at|

Lead the @cK.|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


nt||bt||bg|3|nt||fp|3|at|^-
Your hand is weak and your long suit is pitiful
^-|
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


st||bg||nt||md|,853ht7432d83ck93|mb|1cp1hp1np2np3n|st||
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


at|^b@2^Z@3This creepy-crawly bidding sequence suggests that the opponents have about 24-25 HCP between them.|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


at|

This means that partner has close to an opening bid, yet ^*ididn't^*  bid. Why?|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3The two main reasons for not bidding with good hands are: |
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


at|

(1) The opponents have already bid your longest suit:|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


at|
(2) You don't relish making a two-level overcall between two bidding opponents.|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Using these guidelines, partner either has long Clubs, or long Diamonds. Partner can't have Spades (would have overcalled 1@s). |
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


at|

Try a Diamond.|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Sherlock Holmes once solved a case by noticing the 'curious incident of the dog in the nighttime.'|
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


at|

The dog had, in fact, done nothing in the nighttime, which was highly significant.|
pg| ***** 94 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3The fact that someone does not do something at the bridge table can often give you as much information as when someone does!|
pg| ***** 95 ***** |

Your strongest suit is A Q x x
as opposed to A Q x x x
^-|
pg| ***** 96 ***** |


fp||at|^B@2^Z@3Whenever you lead from an A Q combination there is a good chance the King is on your right. 

You are basically conceding a cheap trick to the declarer.

|
pg| ***** 97 ***** |


at|If you don't lead the suit, declarer cannot take a trick with that King.

If you are going to give up a trick, you want to get something back for your money.|
pg| ***** 98 ***** |


at|

When you lead from A Q x x, the most you can get back is three tricks and even that is iffy; one opponent may also hold four cards in the suit, etc.|
pg| ***** 99 ***** |


at|

However, when you lead from A Q x x x, you stand an excellent chance of establishing four tricks (if partner has the Jack or if partner gets in and returns the suit).|
pg| ***** 100 ***** |


at|

Leading from A Q x x x is one of the best leads against NT; leading from A Q x x is not.|
pg| ***** 101 ***** |

When partner gets in with the @cA, you side can cash three Spade tricks, but that's not enough to defeat 3NT.|
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


up|4|pc|h7|nt|^B@2^Z@3If you lead something else, and partner reads your 'something else' lead as discouraging, partner can shift to the @sJ upon winning the @cA; the good guys wind up with four Spades and a Club.|

st||bg||nt||md|,qt4hkt234dt98ct8|mb|1np4np6n|
pg| ***** 107 ***** |


at|^B@2^Z@3Against 3NT a low Heart is automatic, but against 6NT your strategy changes.|
pg| ***** 108 ***** |


at|

You do not want to give declarer a possible twelfth trick by leading away from an honor if you can help it.|
pg| ***** 109 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Against 6NT you normally play the waiting game if neither opponent has indicated a long suit.

You are not trying to set up a slew of tricks, you are desperately trying to get two tricks.|
pg| ***** 110 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3If declarer needs to take major suit finesses into your hand, you have the answer.|
pg| ***** 111 ***** |

Lead a Diamond.|

pg| ***** 113 ***** |


fp||at|^B@2^Z@3Now it should be a bit easier ot pick the right suit to lead. 

But you will have to lead the proper card in that suit.|
pg| ***** 114 ***** |


at|

Your goal is to give partner a clear picture of what you have in the suit you are leading.|
pg| ***** 115 ***** |

Otherwise, how will partner know whether to continue that suit or to shift to some other promising looking suit?|

fp||
at|^B@2^Z@3A 'perfect' sequence is a suit headed by three or more consecutive honors; suits to die for.|
pg| ***** 118 ***** |

Suits headed by AKQ,  KQJ,  QJT,  JT9 or T98 are examples of suits headed by perfect sequences.|

Suits headed by AKJ, KQT,  QJ9,  JT8 and T97 also make for strong opening leads.|

Lead the top card and hope partner reads it as 'top of nothing'.|

Leading from four worthless cards
^-|
pg| ***** 137 ***** |


fp||at|^B@2^Z@3Basically the idea is the same: lead your highest card and hope for the best.|
pg| ***** 138 ***** |


at|

However, if your highest card is the 9, the 9 may be too valuable a card to spend on the opening lead.|
pg| ***** 139 ***** |


at|

Most good players lead second highest from 9^*U7^* 32.|
pg| ***** 140 ***** |


at|

Although the Ten is considered an honor, partner usually expect a little more than just a Ten when you lead low.|
pg| ***** 141 ***** |

nt|^B@2^Z@3Clubs is your stronger suit, but leading from AQJx usually gives up an unnecessary trick to declarer's King.|
pg| ***** 144 ***** |


at|

What you really want is for partner to ^*Bswitch^*  to a Club.|
pg| ***** 145 ***** |


hc|s7|nt|^B@2^Z@3In order to maximize your chances for partner to switch, lead your second highest Spade, the 7, hoping partner can read it as a discouraging card.|

If you lead a low Spade, partner is sure to return Spades for all eternity.|
pg| ***** 147 ***** |

pg| ***** 162 ***** |


at|

With two non-adjacent honors and a three card suit, there are problems, like blocking the suit in case partner has the length you are hoping for.|
pg| ***** 163 ***** |


at|

It works like this:|
pg| ***** 164 ***** |


at|

1) With A T x,   K T x   or  Q T x,  lead low.|

at|

2) With A J x   or   K J x   you might try leading the Jack.|
pg| ***** 166 ***** |


at| It is the beginning of the 'great unblock'. Of course, partner has to know that you are making a 'genius' lead. Don't hold your breath.|
pg| ***** 167 ***** |


at|

3) With A Q x,  try the Queen.|
pg| ***** 168 ***** |

Leading from an interior sequence;
suits headed by the A J T  or  K J T
^-|
pg| ***** 178 ***** |


fp||at|^B@2^Z@3Here we run into conflicting methods. The 'standard' lead from suits headed by A J T, or the K J T is the Jack. |
pg| ***** 179 ***** |


at|

However, the Jack is also led from suits headed by the J T 9 or J T 8. As a result, neither partner nor declarer can be sure what the lead is from.|
pg| ***** 180 ***** |


at|

In order to avoid this confusion, I suggest that you play a lead convention called 'Jack denies'.|
pg| ***** 181 ***** |


at|

If you adopt this convention, the lead of the Jack is always a highest card and is assumed to be top of a sequence.|
pg| ***** 182 ***** |


at|

Both partner and, unfortunately, declarer know immediately where all the missing honors are.|
pg| ***** 183 ***** |

However, if you play 'Jack denies', you still have to lead something from  from  A J T or K J T combinations.|

How can partner tell? Piece of cake.|
pg| ***** 187 ***** |


at|

When you lead the Ten, partner checks his own hand and then makes a quarter turn of his neck to the right to check dummy.

If partner sees the Jack, he knows you have led top of a sequence.|
pg| ***** 188 ***** |


at|

If he sees the 9, he knows you have led from an A J T or K J T combination.|

If he sees neither he assumes you have led from the A J T or the K J T.|

How can partner tell if it is a high card or a strong lead?|

Partner checks his own hand for the Ten and then uses the old 'neck to the right' routine to check dummy for the Ten.|

If partner spots the Ten, your lead is from weakness.|

If partner can't see the Ten anyplace, he assumes your lead is from strength.|

nt|^B@2^Z@3If you decide to adopt the leads of the Jack, Ten 9 as described, you can continue to use these leads throughout the entire hand if you wish, not only on the opening lead.|

The carding convention described here is called ^*bcoded 9's and 10's.^*  |

All well and good. However, if either opponent has bid the suit, these honor card leads are usually doomed.|
pg| ***** 238 ***** |

In order to develop such suits for more than one or two tricks, knowing one opponent has four- or five-card length, you need to find partner with at least one missing honor.|

^-Key ideas from Chapter 1
^-|
pg| ***** 277 ***** |


fp||at|^B@2^Z@3
Tops on the A-list of leads are suits headed by three- or four-card perfect honor sequences.

Not far behind are top of near perfect sequences.|
pg| ***** 278 ***** |


at|

Also high on the list is leading partner's suit, especially after an overcall or a lead directing double.|
pg| ***** 279 ***** |


at|

The lead of an Ace is the strongest lead and asks partner to unblock the missing honor or give count lacking an honor.|
pg| ***** 280 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3This book also suggests leading the 9 from holdings headed by the AT9,  KT9,  QT9, and 10 from holdings headed by AJT  or  KJT.|
pg| ***** 281 ***** |


at|

From three or four worthless cards, lead high to deny an honor.|
pg| ***** 282 ***** |


at|

With five or six worthless cards,  lead fourth best if you have an outside entry or two.|
pg| ***** 283 ***** |


at|

The lead of a small card promises at least one honor and suggests that you can stand a return of the suit.|
pg| ***** 284 ***** |


at|

If you want something else returned lead a higher spot card.|
pg| ***** 285 ***** |


at|

Tend to lead an unbid major rather than an unbid minor if it is a close call.|
pg| ***** 286 ***** |


at|

But if the minor is demonstrably stronger than the major (three honor cards), lead the minor.|
pg| ***** 287 ***** |


at|

Listen to the bidding for clues.

They are there.|
pg| ***** 288 ***** |


at|

If partner has a chance to overcall at the one-level and doesn't, that's a clue; if partner has a chance to double an artificial bid and doesn't, that's a clue.|
pg| ***** 289 ***** |


at|

If they don't wind up in a major suit contract you can conclude they have fewer than eight cards between them in that suit, yet another clue.|
pg| ***** 290 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Good luck!|
