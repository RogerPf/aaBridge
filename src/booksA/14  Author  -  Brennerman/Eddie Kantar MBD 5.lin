pg| ***** 4 ***** |


ht|e|fp||at|^B@2^Z@3In the last chapter we encountered three different messages that defenders can relay through spot card signals: attitude, count, and suit preference.

Against suit contracts, all of these are important in different circumstances.

The same is true when you are defending against notrump, although attitude and count come up far more often than suit preference.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|

As ever the most important trick is the first one.

Third hand must send the right message, or the whole defense may go off track.

We will take a look at various honor card or "strong" leads your partner can make - the Ace through the 9 - and how  you should signal in response to each.

Basically you will be giving partner an attitude signal the majority of the time.

If you like the suit (have an honor) signal encouragement with the highest spot card you can afford; if you don't like the suit (you do not have an honor) you play your lowest dard; with ^*idoubleton^*  honors, overtake or unblock.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|^b@2^Z@3One more reminder: there are fewer high-lows with doubletons against notrump, unless they have changed the rules recently, there is to be no ruffing going on.|

^*BTHE KING IS LED^*|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


AT|


The King is led from the top of a sequence: KQJ, KQ10, etc.

Occasionally, partner may be leading from a short suit headed by the KQx, or AKx, but you will have to figure that out from the dummy and your hand.

Partner's suit should not be worse than KQ9x (even this is rare), since he would lead fourth best rather than an honor from non-sequential holdings.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|

This situation is very similar to the one we encountered in the last chapter: when partner leads an honor, he wants to know if you have a high honor.

^*IIf you do, signal with the highest spot you can afford; if you do not have an honor, play low.

If you have a doubleton honor, overtake or unblock.^*|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |

It is as simple as that.

Some examples will help:|

The lead of the Queen promises the Jack and typically is led from combinations headed by the QJ10 or the QJ9.

Every so often the lead is made from QJx in the hopes of hitting partner.|

As third hand, overtake with Ax or Kx, unblock with 10x and signal encouragement with Qxx(x) or 10xx(x).

AT|


Many players have adopted this lead convention against notrump.

Holding the KQ109(x), the Queen is led asking third hand to unblock the Jack - period|
pg| ***** 121 ***** |

Of course, third hand signals encouragement holding the Ace and plays low lacking either honor.|

pn|Declarer,Partner,Dummy,You|st||bg||nt||nt|^B@2^Z@3In each of the following examples partner leads the Queen and dummy plays the 7.

Against notrump contracts in particular, it is useful to play that the lead of the Jack promises the ten and denies a higher honor.

When partner leads a jack against notrump, you know were all the missing honors are - in declarer's hand!|
pg| ***** 131 ***** |


at|

The decision to encourage or not depends on dummy's and your holdings in the suit.

Normally you encourage with holdings such as Q72 or K73 by by playing the 7.|

Holding the Ace, you have to judge whether or not it is right to win the trick or duck.|

nt|^B@2^Z@3You also know by adding your 11 HCP to their combined minimum total (15 + 10 = 25) that partner has at most 4 HCP including the @sJ.

As when we know from Chapter 1, the 10 can be led from KJ10x,  AJ10x or the top of a sequence.

If you can see the Jack, then you know that it si from the top of a sequence; if you can see the nine, it has to be from one of the interior sequences.

If you cannot see either, play partner for one of the stronger honor holdings.|

Actually, this is going to be a fourth-best card.

Often, you won't get a chance to signal, since dummy may play low, and you will have to play "third hand high" so as not to give declarer a cheap trick.|
pg| ***** 154 ***** |


at|

But if dummy does win the trick, you do have an opportunity to signal.

However, this is not a straightforward encourage/discourage situation; sometimes your attitude to the suit will already be known, because you couldn't top dummy's card.|

In General, if the dummy wins the first trick with the Ace, encourage if you have the King or Queen.|

^-Count Situations

pg| ***** 196 ***** |


fp||at|
You have just seen a common example of a defender giving count at notrump.

Partner leads low, dummy plays the Queen or a lower card that third hand cannot top, third hand gives count.

There are two other count situations that you should be familiar with.|
pg| ***** 197 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3^*BWHEN PARTNER LEADS AN ACE^*|
PG| ***** 198 ***** |


AT|


The Ace is a very unusual lead against notrump.

Unless the bidding has suggested otherwise, it is led from strong honor combinations missing just one honor: AKQ10, AKJ10, conceiveably AKJ9xx or AKJxxx.|
pg| ***** 199 ***** |


at|

Third hand is requird to drop the missing honor if third hand is lucky enough to have it; failing that, third hand gives count (high-low with an even number, lowest from an odd number).|

pg| ***** 201 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3You lead the Ace and partner drops the nine.

What does this mean?|

wt|w|pc|sass9|

pc|s|
pg| ***** 204 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3|
pg| ***** 205 ***** |


It means partner does not have the Jack or else she would have played it.

The @s9 is count.|
pg| ***** 206 ***** |
pg| ***** 207 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3It cannot be second highest from four so it must be a doubleton|
pg| ***** 208 ***** |


at|

You should shift and wait for partner to lead through declarer's Jack.|
pg| ***** 209 ***** |


up|2|pc|s3|
pg| ***** 210 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Had partner played the @s3 showing an odd number, you would figure her for three Spades leaving declarer with @sJxx.

In that case you can play your Spades from the top and run five tricks.|
pg| ***** 211 ***** |
pg| ***** 212 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Another example:|

nt|^B@2^Z@3Either South's Queen is well guarded, in which case you cannot pick it up, or partner has three Spades and the Queen is coming down under your King.|

Go for it.

Play the King and try for six quick ones.|

nt|^B@2^Z@3Partner's play of the @s2 is either low from three small or a singleton.

If partner has a singleton, chances of defeating this contract looking at dummy are bleak.|
pg| ***** 223 ***** |


sk||nt|^B@2^Z@3So take the rosier view that partner has three small and plunk down the @sK.

In no time at all, you will see you made the winning decision.|

nt|^B@2^Z@3^*BWHEN THE OPPONENTS LEAD A SUIT^*|
pg| ***** 225 ***** |


AT|


Easily the most important use of the count signal takes place when declarer attacks dummy's long suit, a suit that is generally missing a high honor or two.

If dummy is short on entries, it is important for the defender with the missing honor to take that honor when declarer plays her ^*Ilast^*  card in the suit.|
pg| ***** 226 ***** |


at|

It works like this:|
pg| ***** 227 ***** |


sk|nw|nt||st||bg||md|94,236,kjqt7,a85|
pg| ***** 228 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3South leads the @s9 and you must help partner out by giving count;|
pg| ***** 229 ***** |


wt|s|pc|s9|at| in this case, play your lowest Spade.|
pg| ***** 230 ***** |


pc|s2sks|nt|^B@2^Z@3Now partner can figure out how many Spades declarer has, and will know to win the second round of the suit in order to cut South off from the dummy.|
pg| ***** 231 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3In this example, your play fo the deuce shows three or five cards.

You can't have five (there are only five missing, and declarer just played one).|
pg| ***** 232 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3But if you have three, then partner must win the second round of Spades.

Now declarer may have a rough time getting back to dummy to score those remaining Spades.|
pg| ***** 233 ***** |


nt||md|q5,8742,kjt9,a63|
pg| ***** 234 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3South leads...|
pg| ***** 235 ***** |


wt|s|pc|sqs7|at|

Partner knows you have either two or four Spades.|
pg| ***** 236 ***** |


sk||

nt|^B@2^Z@3If you had two, declarer would have four and Spades would be trump.

Partner should play you for four Spades and declarer for two.|
pg| ***** 237 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Best is for partner to win the second round of Spades, taking declarer's last Spade.|
pg| ***** 238 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Remember, when giving count with four cards, play your second-highest card if you feel you can afford it (from 10 9 3 2 you may have a problem).

If you can make a signal clear, do so. Don't give partner a chance to go wrong.|
pg| ***** 239 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Keep in mind all these ducking plays are very impressive, but not when you have the setting tricks available in another suit!|

Partner's @h7 is obviously from four cards, South would have corrected the auction to 4 Hearts with three or four Hearts.|
pg| ***** 249 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3You must think fast.

If partner has four Hearts, declarer has two.|
pg| ***** 250 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3In order to kill the Heart suit you must duck!|
pg| ***** 251 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3But your King will fall under the Ace, you may be thinking...yes it will, but South will not know it unless you flash your hand or sweat bullets.|

^*BJack^* ^eOvertake with Qx,  Kx,  or Ax; signal encouragement with the Queen or King; 
^Euse your judgement with the Ace.|
pg| ***** 260 ***** |

^*BTen^* ^eShows AJ10,  KJ10 or top of a sequence. Overtake with the Ace, the King, or 
^Ewith Qx; signal encouragement with the Qxx,  or Qxxx; play your lowest card to 
^edeny an honor. ^*IP. S. If you can see the Jack, partner has led top of a 
^esequence, play accordingly.^*|

^*BNine^* ^eShows A109,  K109 or Q109 combination as well as top of a sequence or top of 
^enothing. Assume the stronger holdings (unless you can see the ten), and play 
^ethird hand high.|
pg| ***** 262 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3^*BSpot card^* ^eAssume fourth best. However, if the Rule of Eleven tells you that it cannot be 
^Efourth best, assume partner is leading from weakness or, perhaps, from three to 
^Ean honor, and play accordingly.|

We encountered suit preference signals in the previous chapter, primarily when you were giving partner a ruff, and telling partner where your entry was so he could put you in again to get another ruff.|

Even though you are not ruffing anything when defending a notrump contract, there are times when you want to send partner a suit preference message.|

nt||bt||bg|3|bt||bg|3|fp|3|at|^B@2^Z@3Key ideas from Chapter 5|
pg| ***** 278 ***** |


fp||at|^B@2^Z@3

The dominant signal at notrump is ^*battitude.^*  When partner leads an honor, think attitude; think unblock!

With a higher honor doubleton, overtake; with a lower honor doubleton, unblock; signal encouragement with an equal honor and play your lowest card when you do not have an honor.|
pg| ***** 279 ***** |


at|

At notrump give ^*Bcount^*  when:
^C-declarer or dummy initiates a suit, particularly when declarer leads up to dummy's long 
^Csuit that is typically lacking one or two of the top three honors;|
pg| ***** 280 ***** |


at|

^C-partner leads an Ace on opening lead;|
pg| ***** 281 ***** |


at|

^C-partner leads low; and dummy plays the Queen or a lower card that you cannot top.|
pg| ***** 282 ***** |


at|

^*BSuit preference^*  signals are rare at notrump. The most common usage is when driving out declarer's last stopper. If you have a choice of equals any of which will drive out that stopper, the card you select is suit preference telling partner where your outside entry lies.|
pg| ***** 283 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3When leading from a suit headed by the KQJ9, lead the King and if that holds, continue with the Jack (not the Queen) asking partner to unblock the 10 if she has it.|
pg| ***** 284 ***** |

When leading from a suit headed by the QJ108, lead the Queen and next time lead the 10 asking partner to unblock the 9 if he has it.|
