fp||ht|f|at| ^B@2^Z@3When your partner leads a suit, you are ^*Ithird^*  to play to the trick.

But when the dummy or declarer starts a suit, you are either ^*isecond^*  or ^*ifourth^*  to play to the trick.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|

When you are fourth to play, you will have seen three cards and your play is frequently marked.

However, second hand play is more difficult.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at|

Second hand play can be divided as follows: when dummy leads the suit or when declarer leads the suit.

It can be further subdivided: when an honor is led or when a small card is led.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|

Before getting into this, there are two sayings you must have heard a zillion times: 'second hand low' and 'cover an honor with an honor'.

If you are happy to play by these two rules then pass 'Go', collect $200, and advance to the next chapter.|

Cover an honor with an honor so as to promote lower cards, usually 9's and 10's, for either yourself or partner.|

To understand 'covering an honor with an honor' (the only way you are ever going to be able to decide whether or not to cover), you have to know why you are covering in the first place.|

No matter how good a player you are, you are not always going to make the winning play in the second seat, particularly early in the play before you have a read on declarer's distribution and/or the number of tricks you need in the suit led.|

Nevertheless, it pays to know what 'normal' second hand play is, the play you would usually make.|

pg| ***** 190 ***** |

If there are return entries to the dummy, play low.

Declarer is not looking into your hand, and is unlikely to take a really deep finesse.|

at|

If declarer does, hold your cards back - way back.|
pg| ***** 192 ***** |


at|

Also, two points about giving count:|
pg| ***** 193 ***** |


at|

^C1) If declarer's count in the suit is known, do not give count; partner already knows the 
^ccount.|
pg| ***** 194 ***** |


at|

^c2) If one defender has all the outside strength, the other nothing much, it is not 
^cimportant for the stronger hand to give count, it is the weaker hand that should help the

Not on your life!|

nt|^B@2^Z@3You need three Clubs to defeat the contract and partner must have the @cAQ10.

If so you must play the @cJ to prevent declarer from ducking the trick into partner and effectively endplaying partner.|

West cannot lead a Heart as there is a sluff and ruff. He can cash his Ace but this sets up declarer's King as trick nine.|

pf||nt|^B@2^Z@3There are many types of ^*Bendplay^*.

nt|^B@2^Z@3Are you ready?|
pg| ***** 471 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3The bidding tells you that partner has at least five Spades and the Rule of Eleven tells you that declarer started with exactly one Spade above the six, which was the King played to trick one.|

nt|^B@2^Z@3Translation: ^*Iyour side has at least four Spade tricks ready to go plus the @hA.^*|

nt|^B@2^Z@3Edward G. Robinson's character in the movie ^*BThe Cincinatti Kid^*  remarks that 'the art of playing cards is making the wrom move at the right time.'

nt|^B@2^Z@3Sometimes a hopeless 'death holding' in declarer's trump suit can be transformed by making the wrong' play.|
pg| ***** 479 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3There are many such positions, but here are a few examples involving honor-nine combinations that will illustrate the point.|
pg| ***** 480 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Suppose you hold a doubleton Q9 over dummy's J8x or 108x.

When dummy leads low, play the Queen, not the nine!|
pg| ***** 481 ***** |


wt|n|pc|ssqsk|

nt|^B@2^Z@3This is a little more elaborate, but basically the same position.|

bt||bg|3|fp|3|nt|^B@2^Z@3^*BKey ideas from Chapter 6^*|
pg| ***** 496 ***** |


at|


Cover an honor with an honor only if there is a chance to promote something for yourself or your partner.

If partner is known to be short, then only cover if you can promote something for yourself.|
pg| ***** 497 ***** |


at|

Cover the last of equal honors in the dummy.

However, if you have a doubleton honor, cover the first of two equal honors.|
pg| ***** 498 ***** |


at|

When declarer leads a Queen or a Jack from the closed hand towards an Ace, and you have one higher honor, assume declarer has the next lower honor and do not cover.|
