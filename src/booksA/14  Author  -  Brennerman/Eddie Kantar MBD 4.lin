Lesson 4

Signaling Against Suits
  }
^-

|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3In Bridge you are not allowed to talk to your partner during the play of the hand.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|

Instead the cards you play on defense are supposed to do the talking for you.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at|

You are trying to tell your partner what's on your mind by the ^*Irelative^*  size of the card(s) you play.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|

It is called signaling. 

It is an art form.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|

Defensive signals come in three packages:|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|

^C1) ^*BAttitude:^*  how you feel about the suit partner has led.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|

^C2) ^*bCount:^*  how many cards you have in a particular suit.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


at|

^C3) ^*bSuit Preference:^*  which suit you want partner to lead.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|

It all reads pretty, but you can only give one of these signals at a time and partner has to know which one you are giving.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Let's consider each separately, paying particular attention to when each is given.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|

The idea is ^*Bnot^*  to have conversations like this with your partner after a signaling disaster: |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


at|

You: "That was an attitude signal you gave me you know." |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


at|

Partner: "No way that was a suit preference signal, it was so obvious".|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


fp|3|at|

^- ^*BAttitude Signals^* 
^-|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


at|
Attitude signals are ^*Bfar and away^*  the most common defensive signal.|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


at|

Whenever partner  leads an honor card, a common lead, you are expected to give an attitude signal.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


at|

Playing 'standard attitude' a relatively high spot card is an encouraging signal |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


at|
and a releatively low spot card is a discouraging signal.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


at|

What is the 'relative' all about?|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Well, if partner leads a suit you don't like, you play your lowest card.|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


at|

But if you were dealt the 987, the seven is your lowest card.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


at|

On the other hand, if partner leads a suit you do like, you play the highest spot card you can afford.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


at|

However, if you have the Q32, then the three is the highest card you can afford.|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


at|

Alas, we come to the awful conclusion that you cannot always tell what partner's attitude is by looking at the card partner plays; you have to look ^*Iunder the card! ^*  |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


at|

What are you looking for under them?|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


at|

You are looking to see if any lower spot cards are missing.|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


at|

If they are, partner is probably signaling encouragement.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


at|

If you can see every spot card lower than partner's between the dummy, you hand and the card dealer plays, then partner's card is discouraging no matter how 'high' it is.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


pn|Declarer,You,Dummy,Partner|bg||ha|Y|tu||st||sv|0|rh||ah|Modern Bridge Defense|ah|Chapter 4|st||bg||md||mb||nt|^B@2^Z@3Just to give you an idea of what you are up against, look at this example.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


ha|y|nt||sk|w|md|5,kq96,234,7|mb|1nppp|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


wt|w|pc|skss|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


ha|y|nt|^B@2^Z@3Is partner signaling encouragement (showing you an honor) or is partner discouraging, showing you no honor in the suit?|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


pc|s|sk||
nt|^B@2^Z@3Your conclusion should be that partner is signaling discouragement because you can see every spot beneath the @s7.|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


at|

That @s7 is partner's lowest Spade; it is the equivalent of a deuce!|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Looks can be deceiving.

This is what is really going on:|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


ha|y|nt||md|aj5,kq96,234,t87|mb|1nppp|wt|w|pc|sksss|ha|y|nt|^B@2^Z@3South has cunningly played low hoping you read partner's seven as an encouraging signal.|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


at|

If you do and continue the suit, declarer scores a cheap trick with the @sJ.|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


sk||nt|^B@2^Z@3The winning play is to switch to another suit and wait for partner to lead a Spade.|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


md||nt|^B@2^Z@3Attitude signals come with two looks.|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


at|

A high-low, called an ^*becho,^*  can be given with a doubleton telling partner you can trump the third round of the suit.|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3The high-low echo is also used to show partner you have an honor in the suit partner has led, usually and ^*Bequal honor.^* |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


at|

How can partner tell which is which?|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3The answer to most signaling questions can be resolved by remembering the bidding and twisting you neck a bit to look at dummy.|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3^*IIf the missing equal honor(s) is in the dummy, then an encouraging signal must be from a doubleton|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


pn|Declarer,Partner,Dummy,You|ha|y|nt||sk|e|md|jt7,ak864,q35,92|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


wt|w|pc|sass9s|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


ha|y|nt|^B@2^Z@3Partner leads the @SA (from Ace-King) and you start a doubleton echo with the @s9. |
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


at|

Partner knows this must be the start of a doubleton echo because the Queen, the missing equal honor is in the dummy.|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


sk||
nt|^B@2^Z@3Partner can safely cash the King and give you a ruff on the third round.|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


md||nt|^B@2^Z@3^*IIf you have supported partner's suit, then your encouraging signal must be the equal honor signal^* |
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


ha|y|nt||sk|e|md|t73,ak862,j4,q95|ha|y|nt|^B@2^Z@3Partner bids Spades, you support Spades, but South winds up playing the hand in a Heart contract.|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


wt|w|pc|sk|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


pc|s|nt|^B@2^Z@3Partner leads the @sK (King from Ace-King in supported suits, remember?), and you play the @s9.|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


pc|s9|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


at|

This must be the equal honor because it can't be from a doubleton given the bidding.|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


sk||nt|^B@2^Z@3Who knows, maybe partner wants you to lead some other suit through declarer.|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


at|

If so, partner can lead a low spade to your Queen, etc. It's like magic.|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


md||fp|2|nt|^B@2^Z@3^*BThe lead of the Ace^* |
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


at|

The easiest way to tackle this 'attitude' problem is by considering the honor card that partner leads.|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3We'll start with the lead of the ^*IAce. ^*|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


at|


In most cases the opening leader figures to have the AKx(x), conceivably Ax.|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3An unsupported Ace (no King, no shortness) is a rare lead unless it is in a suit partner has bid.|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


ha|y|nt||sk|e|md|267,a3,qjt9,k854|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


wt|w|pc|sas|
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


ha|y|nt|^B@2^Z@3This time it appears that partner is leading from shortness because you have the King.|
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


at|

Your normal play is the @s8, the most encouraging spot card you can play, to ask partner to continue the suit as you envision giving partner a third-round ruff.|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


sk||
nt|^B@2^Z@3However, if you want partner to lead some other suit even more than a Spade, play low even though you have an equal honor!|
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


at|

This is a basic defensive principle. It can be read like this:|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3^*IWhen partner leads an honor card and you have an equal honor, but want partner to switch to another suit (maybe you have a void or an AQJ over a King in the dummy, etc.) play low; do not encourage partner to continue the original suit.|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


at| ^*BRe-read this. Again. ^*|
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3^*IWhen partner leads an honor card and you have an equal honor, but want partner to switch to another suit (maybe you have a void or an AQJ over a King in the dummy, etc.) play low; do not encourage partner to continue the original suit.|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |

pg| ***** 78 ***** |


nt||pc|hkh|
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


ha|y|nt|^B@2^Z@3Your first inclination is probably to play the @h8.|
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


at|

But remember that this is a signal that encourages a continuation.|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


sk||
nt|^B@2^Z@3Do you really want this?|
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


at|

Not here - look at your Diamonds!|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3You want a Diamond switch much more than a Heart continuation, so ^*Iplay low! ^*|
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


pc|h2|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


at|


The low Heart you play at trick one does not request a shift to any specific suit - it says that you have something else in mind. If you want a Heart continuation encourage with the @h8.|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3When you play low, partner must try to figure out which suit you want led.|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


at|

In this case, looking at the dummy and his own hand, it should be obvious.|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


nt||pc|h|nt|^B@2^Z@3Assume partner gets on board with the @d8, dummy plays the nine, and you win the 10.|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


nt||pc|d8ddtd|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Now you can lead a low Heart to partner's known @hQ for a second Diamond play.|

nt|^B@2^Z@3If declarer ruffs low, partner can overruff, while if declarer rufffs with an honor, your combined trump holdings will produce the setting trick.|
pg| ***** 96 ***** |


at|

Well done!|
pg| ***** 97 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3You 'knew' to play the thirteenth Diamond because declarer can't have another Heart (partner's raise showed three).|
pg| ***** 98 ***** |

at|

You do ^*Inot^*  want partner to continue Diamonds, declarer might ruff.|
pg| ***** 111 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3You want partner to play a third Heart, which promotes your @sJ to the setting trick regardless of the Diamond position.|
pg| ***** 112 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Holding small Spades, you would encourage partner in Diamonds, since the hope of a fourth deensive trick would be the @dK.|
pg| ***** 113 ***** |


pn|Declarer,Partner,Dummy,You|
md||nt|^B@2^Z@3^*BStarting a false echo^* ^B@2^Z@3|
pg| ***** 114 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Playing a discouraging card on partner's high card lead generally suggests that you have strength in another suit, and can stand a switch.|
pg| ***** 115 ***** |


at|

But what if you don't have any side-suit strength, and a switch would be disastrous.|
pg| ***** 116 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3In that case, you might actually give partner a false encouraging signal!|
pg| ***** 117 ***** |


at|

(You can be so clever at times, it's scary.)|
pg| ***** 118 ***** |

ha|y|nt|^B@2^Z@3Partner leads the @sA and you can 'see' that no minor suit winners are available.|
pg| ***** 122 ***** |


sk||at|

Rather than suggest a disastrous switch to a minor, make a false signal by playing the @s9.|
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


pc|s9s|
pg| ***** 124 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3This will encourage partner to bang down the @sK, and with your two trump tricks, the hand is defeated.|
pg| ***** 125 ***** |


at|

If you thoughtlessly play low on the opening lead, partner will probably shift to a Club.|
pg| ***** 126 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Once that happens, you can kiss partner's second Spade trick ^*iadios,^*  as it will vanish on one of dummy's Diamonds.|
pg| ***** 127 ***** |

ha|y|pc|daddd|
pg| ***** 133 ***** |


ha||nt|^B@2^Z@3Quite reasonably, partner deduced from this play I must have a high honor in another suit, and on the bidding, it looked likely to be the @hK.|
pg| ***** 134 ***** |


sk||
nt|^B@2^Z@3So, rather than play another Diamond, and establish dummy's Queen for a possible Heart discard...|
pg| ***** 135 ***** |

nt|^B@2^Z@3If you didn't know better,it looks as if my partner blew that defense by not taking his @DK.|
pg| ***** 141 ***** |


at|

However, any expert worth his salt will tell you that I was to blame for not giving a false encouragement signal in Diamonds, preventing partner from going wrong.|
pg| ***** 142 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Of course, if I'd had the @hK and not the @SK, a Heart shift at trick two would have been critical, and my @d2 would have been the absolutely correct card.|
pg| ***** 143 ***** |

If only partner hadn't trusted me so.|
pg| ***** 144 ***** |


pn|Declarer,Partner,Dummy,You|
md||nt|^B@2^Z@3^*BShortness or strength?^* |
pg| ***** 145 ***** |


at|

There will be times when partner may not be able to 'read' your high-low echo; partner won't know for sure whether you are signaling with a doubleton or with an equal honor.|
pg| ***** 146 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3In many cases it doesn't matter.|
pg| ***** 147 ***** |


at|

As long as partner leads the suit a third time, you will either trump or produce the equal honor.|
pg| ***** 148 ***** |


ha||nt||sk|e|md|t65,ak73,j94,q82|
pg| ***** 149 ***** |


ha|y|nt|^B@2^Z@3Partner leads the Ace in an unbid suit and you start your echo with the @s8.|

Partner dutifully continues...|

Either way it is a good news ending.|
pg| ***** 155 ***** |


sk||nt|^B@2^Z@3However, if South has denied ffour Spades during the bidding, partner knows you can't have a doubleton and must have the Queen.|

md||nt|^B@2^Z@3Before leaving the lead of the Ace, this reminder: ^*Iif you normally lead Ace from Ace-King and you have AK doubleton, lead the King then the Ace.^* |
pg| ***** 209 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3^*BThe lead of the King^* |
pg| ***** 210 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3The lead of the King is generally made from a KQ combination though it could be from the AKx(x)(x) if partner has bid the suit or if the suit has been bid and supported.|
pg| ***** 211 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Third had does well to keep the following points in mind before making an encouraging attitude signal with an equal honor or a doubleton.|
pg| ***** 212 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@31) The Ace and Jack are both considered equal honors because partner's lead has shown both the King and the Queen.|
pg| ***** 213 ***** |

With an equal honor, tend to give an encouraging signal.|
pg| ***** 214 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@32) A high-low signal with a doubleton is only given when you cannot possibly have an equal honor.|
pg| ***** 215 ***** |

There are several common applications:|
pg| ***** 216 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3^*BThe Ace and Jack are both in the dummy^* |

Partner sees the Ace and Jack so your signal must be from shortness; it can't be an equal honor.|

ha|y|nt|^B@2^Z@3Should you play high or will partner think you have the Ace?|

pc|s9|at|

When partner sees the @s9, partner will not know for a split second whether you have the Ace or a doubleton.|
pg| ***** 226 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3However, declarer is sure to take the trick with the Ace when the Jack is in the dummy (the Jack is good for a second trick later if the Ace is taken now).|
pg| ***** 227 ***** |


pc|sa|at|

So partner will know you have shortness the moment she sees the Ace.|

ha|y|nt|^B@2^Z@3When dummy has the Ace and declarer the Jack, declarer usually plays low hoping the opening leader continues the suit, thus giving declarer a trick he does not deserve.|
pg| ***** 232 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Let's turn this around and look at it from partner's point of view:|
pg| ***** 233 ***** |

If the King holds the trick, partner needs to know who has the Jack.|

pg| ***** 265 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3On the other hand, don't overtake if ruffing the third Spade can cost you a natural trump trick (if you hold the QJx of trumps, for example).|
pg| ***** 266 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3^*BA blocked suit:^*  A situation where entry problems make it difficult to cash winners in a suit.|
pg| ***** 267 ***** |

Here, if you play low on the King, you will win the next trick with the Ace, but you have no more Spades to play.|
pg| ***** 268 ***** |


md||nt|^B@2^Z@3^*BThe lead of the Queen^* |
pg| ***** 269 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3The lead of the Queen is normally a top of a two- or three-card honor sequence including the Jack, but denying the Ace or King.|
pg| ***** 270 ***** |


at|

It also might be from shortness, presumably in partner's suit.|
pg| ***** 271 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Some players also lead the Queen from AKQ (I do and it works).|
pg| ***** 272 ***** |


at|

However, more often than not, the Queen is led from QJ combinations.|
pg| ***** 273 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3When partner leads a Queen, the King and 10 are considered equal honors and third hand tends to encourage with either.|
pg| ***** 274 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3And what about the high-low from a doubleton?|
pg| ***** 275 ***** |

Fine, as long as partner won't confuse it with the equal honor signal which takes precedence.|

nt|^B@2^Z@3You have to be careful about high-lowing with a doubleton lest partner think you have an equal honor.|
pg| ***** 284 ***** |

In order to be safe, the three missing honors should either be in dummy or will be visible to partner after the play to the first trick.|

ha|y|nt|^B@2^Z@3If the bidding indicates that declarer may have a singleton, you have to play your Ace or lose it.|
pg| ***** 305 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3However, if you know the suit is divided evenly from the bidding, you may decide to signal encouragement to keep flexibility in the suit.|
pg| ***** 306 ***** |


ha|y|nt||sk|e|md|k6,q5,348,ajt972|sk|en|wt|w|pc|sqs|
pg| ***** 307 ***** |


ha|y|nt|^B@2^Z@3If the bidding tells you that partner has a doubleton, it is frequently right to signal encouragement allowing declarer to take the King.|
pg| ***** 308 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Later if partner has an early entry, partner can return the suit giving you the opportunity to play a third Spade for a possible trump promotion.|
pg| ***** 309 ***** |

Standard count signals
^-|
pg| ***** 360 ***** |


fp||at|^B@2^Z@3While the attitude signal tells partner how you feel about the suit partner has led, the ^*Bcount signal^*  tells partner (and declarer) how many cards you have in the suit being led.|
pg| ***** 361 ***** |


at|

Once your partner knows how  many cards you have, he also knows how many cards declarer has.|
pg| ***** 362 ***** |


at|

This in turn, makes the obligatory task of counting declarer's distribution much easier.|
pg| ***** 363 ***** |


at|

It is important not to confuse the two signals.|
pg| ***** 364 ***** |


at|

The attitude signal is given when one defender leads an honor card and the other signals encouragement or discouragement.|
pg| ***** 365 ***** |


at|

The count signal is given mainly when:

^c1) either declarer or dummy initiate a new suit.|
pg| ***** 366 ***** |


at|

^C2) partner leads a suit and it is quite clear from dummy's holding and declarer's play 
^cfrom dummy that you cannot possibly hold an honor in the suit.|
pg| ***** 367 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3When giving 'standard' count, play high-low with a doubleton, but not necessarily with honor doubleton.|
pg| ***** 368 ***** |


at|

More often than not, the honor should be retained.|
pg| ***** 369 ***** |


at|

With four cards (T763) play the highest you can afford, excluding your highest, and then your lowest.|
pg| ***** 370 ***** |


at|

With T763 play the 7 and then the 3.|
pg| ***** 371 ***** |


at|

However, if your second-highest looks valuable (JT42), play your third highest and then your lowest.|
pg| ***** 372 ***** |


at|

The idea is to high-low with an even number and low-high with an odd number.|
pg| ***** 373 ***** |


at|

The bottom line is: ^*Iwhen either declarer or dummy initiates a suit, you cannot give attitude, only count.^* |
pg| ***** 374 ***** |


at|

Is there a downside to giving partner count signals and vice versa?|
pg| ***** 375 ***** |


at|

Yes.|
pg| ***** 376 ***** |


at| If declarer pays any attention to the cards you and partner are playing, declarer can get a count on your hands too!|
pg| ***** 377 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3So the real problem with this count signal is knowing when to give it.|
pg| ***** 378 ***** |


at|

For example, there is no point in giving a count signal in any suit where the bidding has already revealed how many cards defender has.|
pg| ***** 379 ***** |


at|

For example: |
pg| ***** 380 ***** |


at||at||




ia|   1dp1hp1sp3dppp|
pg| ***** 381 ***** |


at|

Even in small villages, everyone knows that South has four Spades so neither defender should be giving count in that suit.|

Giving count is very important when dummy has a strong suit missing the Ace, King, or both.|
pg| ***** 383 ***** |


st||bg||ha|y|nt||sk|e|md|5,2,kqj9,a863|

That odd number can't be five because if it were, declarer would be void and that Spade would be coming from another deck.|
pg| ***** 391 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3The @s2 must show three meaning declarer has two.|
pg| ***** 392 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Once you know declarer's count, the idea is to take your trick when declarer is playing her ^*Ilast^*  card.|

Suit preference signals
^-|
pg| ***** 516 ***** |


fp||at|^B@2^Z@3The ^*Bsuit preference signal^*  is the simplest and most elegant of all the suit signals, yet the average player has more trouble with it than any other. Why?|
pg| ***** 517 ***** |


at|

Because he confuses it with the attitude signal.|
pg| ***** 518 ***** |


at|

Attitude is given the vast majority of the time.|
pg| ***** 519 ***** |


at|

This section deals with the exceptional cases where a 'suit preference' signal is given instead.|
pg| ***** 520 ***** |


at|

What is the difference?|
pg| ***** 521 ***** |


at|

When giving attitude on a high honor lead from partner, a low card from third hand asks for a shift, but does not tell partner which suit.|
pg| ***** 522 ***** |


at|

Partner is supposed to figure it out by the look of the dummy, the bidding, etc.|
pg| ***** 523 ***** |


at|

When giving suit preference you can actually tell your partner which suit you want led, including a continutation fo the suit that has been led.|
pg| ***** 524 ***** |


pn|Declarer,You,Dummy,Partner|st||bg||nt|^B@2^Z@3Here are five common suit preferences scenarios that you should be familiar with, the first being far and away the most common and most important.|

nt|^B@2^Z@3In any case, you continue with the King and partner discards a low Diamond.|

pc|sksds|

nt|^B@2^Z@3You 'prefer' partner to return a Diamond so you can give partner another Spade ruff, but how will partner know to do that?|

pg| ***** 536 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3When giving partner a ruff, the relative size of the card you lead tells partner which suit you want returned; a relatively ^*Blow spot card asks for the lower-ranking side suit,^*  a relatively ^*Bhigh spot card asks for the higher-ranking side suit.^* |

nt|^B@2^Z@3In this auction, knowing partner has six or seven Spades, North only wants to know about the missing Aces and perhaps the@cK.|
pg| ***** 636 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Slam is not good, however, as South's Spades are weak, and strong defenders can exploit that weakness here.|

pc|hkh|ha|y|nt|^B@2^Z@3Partner's lead is King from Ace-King at the five level or higher.|

You can see that if partner continues with the @hA forcing dummy to ruff, your @SQ will become the setting trick.|
pg| ***** 639 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3In order to ask for a continuation play the @h8, an encouraging spot card.|

But what if you want a shift?|
pg| ***** 642 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3If you want a shift, nine times out of ten it will be clear to partner which side suit you want.|
pg| ***** 643 ***** |


at|

One side suit is usually stronger than the other and your request is for the weaker side suit, called the 'obvious' suit.|
pg| ***** 644 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3If you want a shift to the 'obvious' suit, play ^*Ilow^*  and trust partner to work it out.|
pg| ***** 645 ***** |


md||nt|^B@2^Z@3^*BWhen giving attitude, a low card doesn't mean 'shift to the lower-ranking suit', it means 'shift to the obvious suit'. 

Re-read this.^* |
pg| ***** 646 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3However, once in a blue moon you may want partner to shift to the less likely side suit, the one partner wouldn't dream of leading...unless you give him a 'The butler did it' signal.|
pg| ***** 647 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Play a screamingly high card, usually an honor, which says 'partner lead the suit you wouldn't dream of leading.|
pg| ***** 648 ***** |

^*IJust lead it!'^* |
pg| ***** 649 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3In general, when you can make your signals obvious, do so. Don't give partner a chance to make a mistake. |

If you do, it will happen. Murphy's Law in action.|

Here you want a Club shift so badly you can taste it.|
pg| ***** 656 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Worse, Clubs is the suit partner will least likely to lead so play the @hJ, (the 9 would encourage continuation), screaming for the unusual shift.|

If partner obliges and returns a Club, the hand is defeated.|

Suit Preference Plays Summaries
^-|
pg| ***** 661 ***** |


fp||at|^B@2^Z@3Here are the five basic situations to use a suit preference signal:|at|

^c1) When giving partner a ruff.|
pg| ***** 662 ***** |


at|

^c2) When partner leads a singleton.|
pg| ***** 663 ***** |


at|

^C3) When the opening lead has set up a number of discards in dummy and the lead has 
^cbeen made in a supported suit.|
pg| ***** 664 ***** |


at|

^C4) When the third hand has shown six-plus cards in the suit that is led.|
pg| ***** 665 ***** |


at|

^C5) When a high honor is led and dummy has a singleton.|
pg| ***** 666 ***** |


at|

In (1) a relatively high card asks for the return of the higher-ranking side suit, while a relatively low card asks for the lower-ranking side suit.|
pg| ***** 667 ***** |


at|

In (2), (3) and (4) the play to trick one is suit preference.|
pg| ***** 668 ***** |


at| 

In (5) the play to the first trick is attitude, but an ^*iunusually^*  high card asks partner to shift to the least likely side suit; the play of a low card asks partner to shift to the more likely side suit: the 'obvious' shift; the play of the middle card asks for a continuation.|
