at|Peter Brennan: The purpose of this course is to acquaint you with some useful tools when you declare a hand. Hopefully, by seeing a number of examples in random order you'll recognize these situations when they pop up in your game.  

Each hand features a common challenge of some sort:  dealing with bad suit breaks, handling tricky entry situations, making inferences from the bidding or play, counting enemy distribution and/or points, when to draw trumps, basic end plays, etc.

These hands should be played using IMP or rubber bridge tactics.  Don't even think of risking the contract to make a measly overtrick or two.

You have 9 tricks, 4@ss, 2@hs, 2@ds and 1@c. If either red suit breaks 3 – 3 (36%), you're home. The challenge is to find the best line of play. Good luck!|

There's been a lot of interest in this hand.  Back in March, Maureen sent out a bulletin announcing this class.  She asked me to include a hand from the course. This is the hand I sent her.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


at|
If either @hs or @ds split 3 – 3 (36%), we'll have our 10th trick.  Only a 3 - 3 @d split will produce an extra trick in that suit, but if @hs break 4 - 2, we may be able to ruff our 4th @h in dummy, so testing @h first offers a better shot at our contract.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


at|
But it's more complicated than that.  If we draw 2 rounds of trump and then test @hs and find they are 4 - 2 (49%)...|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|...the opp who wins the 3rd @h may return the master @s, removing dummy's last trump and leaving us a trick short.  Then we'll have to rely on the @ds being 3 - 3.|

If instead we play 3 rounds of @hs without drawing trump, our pitifully weak @s spots will be a problem.  A defender will surely overruff dummy and we'll go down.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |

This hand is all about timing and keeping control of a side suit.  This theme will keep recurring throughout this series and throughout your bridge career. Since we must lose a @h trick anyway, lead a small @h at trick 2 and DUCK!|up|24|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt|BTW, this simple ducking play to keep control and help establish a suit has acquired a pretty fancy name – this is now called a “coup à blanc.”  In Brooklyn, we still call it DUCKING.  :)|

West with 4 @hs also had 3 @ss so he had to helplessly follow to our last @h.|

What if the defender with 3 @ss had only 2 @hs and is able to ruff one of our @h honors? Let's have a look.|

To sum up, 4 @s is cold if @ss break 3 - 2 and @hs are no worse than 4 - 2 or @ds are 3 - 3.  That's about a 60% game.|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


mc|10|sk||sc|y|nt|The lesson text: We must find a 10th trick.  @ss must be 3 - 2 but if either @hs or @ds break 3 - 3 (36%) we're home.  Also, there's a possibility of ruffing the 4th @h in dummy, but the timing is crucial. To keep all our options, first duck a @h trick and draw 2 rounds of trump then test hearts. We may be able to ruff our last @h in dummy.|

The Forcing Pass is the strongest action South can take.  It shows slam interest and at least a second round @h control.  Naturally, this treatment should be discussed and agreed upon with your regular partner.|PC|h4|

How did this hand get into my class? If @ss are 2 – 2 (40%) and @ds 3 – 2 (68%) you'll take all 13 tricks!  But East's preempt should alert you to bad breaks on this deal.  Good luck!|

“If it looks too easy, it usually isn't!” is a truism in bridge and, too often, in life also. When we play 2 rounds of @ss, we discover East has a trump trick.  Therefore, before we assume @ds will behave (break 3 – 2 (68%)), we should take some precautions.|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|Our plan is simple:  when East wins his @sQ we'll be sure he has no safe exit card.  To begin, it's a good idea to ruff the board's last @h.  Then any future @h lead will give us a RUFF - SLUFF.|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|s7|pc|h7|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


at|
In case East is void of @ds we should not lead a high @d from our hand.  Instead, lead from the board.  That way, if East does ruff we'll play our @d5 and claim.  Do you all see that?|

So @ds are 5 – 0.  Well that won't hurt us now.  We can cash our high @c.  If East can ruff one of them we know he has only @h left and on his lead we can sluff our @d5 and claim.|

By now we know East had 3 @ss, no @ds and 3 @cs (West pitched a @c on the 2nd @s) so 7 @hs.  Now we can lead our high @d because if East ruffs in, his @h return will allow us to pitch our low @d and ruff on the board.|

The lesson text:  When we know East has a @s trick we must play carefully in case the@ds are not 3 – 2 (32%).  First ruff the board's last @h.  Be sure to lead@d from dummy so if East trumps we can follow with our losing@d5.  Strip @cs and then play high@ds.  If East refuses to ruff throw him in with his @sQ.|

nt|This is a fine contract with only the @cA as a sure loser.  But the contract is 4 @h not 6 @h so play carefully to bring home at least 10 tricks.  Good luck!|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


at|
Playing match point scoring, most of the field would finesse for the @hQ.  But we're playing high stakes rubber bridge (or IMPs) in this class, so safety is necessary.|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


at|
We must play cautiously because we only have 7 trumps.  If @hs are 4 – 2 (49%) and we take a losing @h finesse, back will come a @s which we'll have to ruff.  We'll have to ruff again after we knock out the @cA and our uncooperative opps will return another @s.  Are you all following this?|

Our plan is to use @cs to draw the enemy trump instead of letting them use @s to draw ours.  At trick 2 we cash the @hK and return dummy's last @h.|

@hA.  We do not finesse.  Assuming West follows to this trick our contract is safe.  There are two @hs out and we'll lose both of them to @c ruffs.  But our only other loser will be the @cA.  Any questions so far?|

East most likely has the@dA for his opening bid but if the@ds break 3 – 2, you'll have your 10th trick.  Good luck!|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


SK||at|
When opponents bid to the four level with a combined holding of 16 high card points, expect they'll have some shape to compensate for their lack of honor cards. We need @ds to be 3 – 2, so we can establish our 10th trick but we can protect against a 4 – 1 trump split.|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


at|
The problem comes when we draw trumps first thing and discover the 4 – 1 break. Then the opps will pound us with @h each time one of them is in with a @d. We'll eventually lose control of the hand and go down. That's what happened when our volunteer played the hand.|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


nt|The mistake is to draw trumps before the @d trick has been established. By not drawing trumps, we have some protection from the @h forces from the defense.|

If the defense continues @h, dummy can ruff the 4th round so declarer's trumps can't be shortened further.  BTW, if the defenders do lead a 4th @h, ironically the @dK we worked so hard to set up is no longer needed.  Instead, we score 6 @ss plus the @h ruff in dummy, the @hA and 2 @cs. |

Here's the lesson text:  We'll need to find@ds breaking 3 - 2 but we can afford @ss to be 4 - 1 if we establish a @d trick before pulling trumps.  The benefit is dummy can ruff the 4th @h which protects our trump holding.|

South has a very strong hand.  We can afford to lose tricks to the @sQ, @hQ and the @cA and still make the contract.  But we'll have to maintain control of the trumps at the same time.|
pg| ***** 101 ***** |


at|
In this hand, our singleton @c is a problem.  The defenders are sure to lead @c at every opportunity and we'll be forced to ruff.  Because of the entry-less dummy we can't finesse for the missing Queens.|

If we simply play out our top@ss, we'll be fine if they break 3-2 (68%).  But if they're 4 – 1 (28%)?|
pg| ***** 103 ***** |


at| We'll have to continue @ss because we can't afford to leave an opp with @sQx.  He might make both @ss and put us down 1.  Everybody following this?|
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


nt|When in with the @sQ, the opp will lead another @c. When we ruff, both the opp and us will have one @s each. We can't afford to draw it because when the defender wins the @hQ, he will have at least one @c to cash and down we go.  If we leave the trump out, the defender will ruff away our 3rd @h winner.|
