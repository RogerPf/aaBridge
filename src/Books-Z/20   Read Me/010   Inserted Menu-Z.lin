This lin file is from a group of files that come as an example of how to add new folders and files to aaBridge.
This group of  folders and files comes in the  folder  called |fp|3|at| ^*bBooks-Z^*n|fp||at|.
BUT on your system it will show with an name like:
^*b^e@2Inserted-menu-Z
Menu-inséré-Z
插入菜单-Z
^c@2^*ndepending on your current language setting.  

You can hide / show this demo menu using the first setting in the ^*b Language ^*n selection menu on the menubar.
