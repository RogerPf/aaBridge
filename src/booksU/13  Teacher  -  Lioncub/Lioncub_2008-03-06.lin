^d @H@2Lioncub’s bidding session is held every Friday in the BIL at noon NY time. 3 Hands @e@3are bid with 4 volunteers and then change. Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play…….or both. Feel free to ask any questions that are bridge related.

^d @H@2What  :|CP||AT| For my later review I like to have a BBO movie representing lioncub's teaching session as close @e@3to the live event as possible. I am delighted that you can also enjoy it.|cp|8|at| 

How  :|CP||AT| In this presentation I have combined the hands from lioncub's Friday Teaching Sessions with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed and edited from the chat. He has approved the bridge information in this movie. You will see the four hands and the auction by the participants and after Allan has asked for a "Lead and Claim." The claim is meaningless and is made so his critique can begin. |cp|8|at| 

Goal :|CP||AT| The emphasis is to present lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  Incorrect grammar and spelling are tolerated. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. All the links in this file are clickable - they turn color when you move your cursor over them.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site. |FP|2|AT|

The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at|^*B HELP^*N |cp||FP|2|at|box at the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section. |FP||CP|8|AT|
 

Please help me improve these movies by sending suggestions to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.|CP||FP||AT|

                                               
                                              Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

^B@2lioncub: on this bidding............spade lead is correct.
lioncub: after 2@C the  3@H is correct.........showing a min of 6-card suit
lioncub: and N is correct to bid 3NT with a singleton Heart.  BUT should S pass?
lioncub: with a 7-card suit.........my preference would be to bid 4@H and not 3@H 
onoway: after 1@h am I too weak to go 2nt?  showing unbids?
lioncub: if W is going to bid over 1@H..........then double showing both suits. 2NT would show 5/5 |

^B@2lioncub: lead is fine
lioncub: I do not like the 3@H bid
lioncub: we are playing Bergen now............so that would show 4-card support and under 7 points
lioncub: have to bid 2@C  
lioncub: and jump to 3@H with next bid........showing 10-12 points with 3-card support
lioncub: never a good idea to jump with only 3-card support.|

^B@2lioncub: don't lead a diamond cos the east hands guarantee a double stop.  I lead a club. 
lioncub: incidentally ............if N has a doubleton honour in diamonds.........he should double 3NT telling partner to lead a small diamond.
lioncub: well bid EW  both bids perfect 
lioncub: 3@C is puppet Stayman  and 3NT denies 4-card or 5-card major.
easybridge: what does 2nt bid mean? 
lioncub: 2NT showed the balanced hand with 14-18 points in balancing position could be lighter. |

lioncub: BIG lesson.  2@D is a good overcall .......vulnerable
lioncub: partner heard it  and over 2@S he chose to pass.............as did W
lioncub: 3@C would be just as bad. 
lioncub: if opps choose to double...........and just take you one off..........THAT WOULD BE 200 TO THEM
lioncub: beating any part score they may make. |

^B@2lioncub: but it gave them a chance to show that they both had some to spare.........and bid game 
lioncub: was it worth interfering with their part score?
gamelynx: no it sure wasn't 
analisals: what about east 2 spade bid? isn't that a weak raise?
lioncub: E is a slight underbid.........danger cards were the 3 small diamonds
lioncub: any more questions? |
