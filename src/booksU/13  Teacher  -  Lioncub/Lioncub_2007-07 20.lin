^d @H@2Lioncub’s bidding session is held every Friday in the BIL at noon NY time. 3 Hands @e@3are bid with 4 volunteers and then change. Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play…….or both. Feel free to ask any questions that are bridge related.

^d @e@2In this presentation we have combined the movie of the hands from lioncub's Friday @e@3Teaching Session with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed version of chat log transcript.  

The emphasis is presenting to you lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  We did not focus on correctness of the grammar or the spelling.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. Clicking the first will move you forward and clicking the second will take you back. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. 

Further, all the links in this file are clickable - it turns blue when you move your cursor over it.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site.




Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

lioncub: bad lead, this was opponent’s suit.  Here lead from unbid minor is best. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


at|
lioncub: Jimmy remembers my rule about 6/5 hand and opens 1@H.  E is not good enough to respond at the 2 level. With 2@D bid he is promising 10+ points. His only possible is 1NT. Now Jimmy will bid 2@S  and E will correct to 3@H.........which Jimmy must pass. |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |

Dianne0516: Is Jimmy's hand strong enough for a reverse?|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |

lioncub: all 6/5 hands are strong enough for reverse........partner has choice of 2 suits.|

aebig: with distribution my hand is worth 9 points which made me go for 2 diamonds. |

lioncub: NO. Lead the K@C  not a small one  this is a suit contract. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|
lioncub: awwwwww shucks..........blush.
1@S-2@C-?  My rule is to always show a second 4-card major. Partner could be void in spades with 4 hearts. Soooooooooooo bid 2@H. Although not forcing in principle......partner bid at the 2 level showing 10+ points.....so highly unlikely to be passed. Then  you will have time now to investigate, and should reach 6@S.
Next hand please.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt|
lioncub: a way may be this; 
1@S-2@C
2@H-3@D ---> FSF (Fourth Suit Forcing)  
4@S - 6@S |

analisals: Would 3 spades be stronger than 4spades here? |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


at|  lioncub: no.|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


at|
raebig: surely the 3 spade shows the strength and we should go on from there to investigate a slam with west hand.   |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


at|
lioncub: good point. But, the  trouble is that W has no good bid over 3@S. No aces or controls. The 2@H bid definitely makes hand huge. Then can see the k@H and the spade holdings......being gigantic. 
Next hand please.|

lioncub: correct lead. |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


at|
lioncub: 1@S-2@D-2@S-?  How can S bid with such poor hand? Answer..........LOOK AT VULNERABILITY. This is a  good case for bidding 5@D or at least  4@D.  MAKE THE opponents HAVE TO GUESS AT A HIGH LEVEL.  If doubled goes 3 off for 500 while  they make 5@S and  they score 650 so 500 is good score for N/S. 
Next hand please.|

lioncub: South  did have opening bid.......using rule of 20 -- 11+5+4=20. But,  1@D is a good 3rd seat opener.  Then,  1@D-1@S-1NT-?  Partner has shown 12 -14. So need to know if he is min. or max. The best bid over 1NT is.................2NT. Just ask. If partner is max. with 3 spades will bid 3@S over 2NT. Here he should pass 2NT. BUT, SOUTH must ask......and not pass tamely. 
Next hand please.|

lioncub: opening bid  should be 1@C.  Try to find fit at the one level. Here there may have been a 4/4 club fit that you did not find. The rest of bidding was very good. Super rebid by N.  1NT is slightly underbid,,,,,,,,,,,but is correct as there is no fit.  10 points is only 1 point more than promised. 
Move on.|

lioncub: irrespective of the result.........and you found a good contract in 2@D. Remember with a flat hand........4/3/3/3......nearly always is best to play in NT. Reason is this...........suit contracts are best when there is a shortage,,,,and can ruff the 3rd round of a suit.  For 4/3/3/3 hands deduct 1 point. So bid over 1@S should be 1NT.
Next hand please.|

lioncub: What a hand.  1@S-2@C-2@S-?  Should E bid? The  answer is YES. Partner has shown a good 5 or 6 card suit. E has pretty poor hand but does have a good 3-card support so bid 3@C. Now to S.  Partner has shown support with 6-9 points. So lets do a hand evaluation.  15HCP+3 for the singleton =18  and remembering ACES ARE GOLD AND KINGS ARE SILVER THEN  GO FOR IT. Don’t even ask just bid 4@S. Remembering to do a hand evaluation once suit is agreed will get you to far more games. Next please.|

lioncub: 1D-1@H-2@D- P, now to Lou. The bid to make now is DOUBLE  SHOWING VALUES IN THE OTHER SUITS AS WELL. Partner may have 4-crd spade suit which is very possible on this bidding.  However you decided to bid 3@H which is  not a terrible bid. Many would do the same. Your partner having heard your 2 bids can pass or take any other action. Remember my article last week THE CAPTAIN?  SOUTH IS NOW THE CAPTAIN and should  bids 3NT. This is not invitational....this is S judgment of the correct contract.|
