^d @H@2Lioncub’s bidding session is held every Friday in the BIL at noon NY time. 3 Hands @e@3are bid with 4 volunteers and then change. Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play…….or both. Feel free to ask any questions that are bridge related.

^d @H@2What  :|CP||AT| For my later review I like to have a BBO movie representing lioncub's teaching session as close @e@3to the live event as possible. I am delighted that you can also enjoy it.|cp|8|at| 

How  :|CP||AT| In this presentation I have combined the hands from lioncub's Friday Teaching Sessions with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed and edited from the chat. He has approved the bridge information in this movie. You will see the four hands and the auction by the participants and after Allan has asked for a "Lead and Claim." The claim is meaningless and is made so his critique can begin. |cp|8|at| 

Goal :|CP||AT| The emphasis is to present lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  Incorrect grammar and spelling are tolerated. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. All the links in this file are clickable - they turn color when you move your cursor over them.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site. |FP|2|AT|

The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at|^*B HELP^*N |cp||FP|2|at|box at the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section. |FP||CP|8|AT|
 

Please help me improve these movies by sending suggestions to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.|CP||FP||AT|

                                               
                                              Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

^B@2lioncub: Correct lead. Bidding is straight forward up to the 2@D bid. With 3 card support for second suit and singleton in the first.......it is dangerous to go to the 3 level. My advice would be to pass 2@D. However,  S is correct to rebid 3@D over 3@C.|

^B@2lioncub: Lead should be the 6@C,  partner's suit. Now let us look at the bidding.
1@C-2NT  The 2NT must be for take out of some description. I play it as 2 lowest unbid suits but could be diamonds and a major.  S not sure.........so can bid 3@D that must be one of the suits.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


AT|
hurley700: If 2 lowest unbid suits then @S lead seems logical. |
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT|
ioncub: Almost always lead partner's suit. I am a simple soul. I lead partner's suit unless a very good reason not to. I can win the inquest. |

^B@2lioncub: My choice for lead would be the longest suit.......diamonds......and lead the 10. We have aggressive 4th seat bid by E  using rule of 15. Suit is goodish..........so why not? Questions? |
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


AT| 
Nywoman: Why did W not bid 2@h
hurley700: Why not 1@C by S? |
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: 1@C would be acceptable as opening bid by S........but not wrong to pass. The hand is very short of good intermediate cards. West cannot bid 2@H. Although he has five @Hs but lacks the required 10+ points. |

^B@2lioncub: Good lead. Tough hand to bid. If we accept the first three bids there is a good negative double by Jimmy, showing the 4-card spade suit. And well done W for muddying the water with the 2@H bid.  N finds a free bid of 3@C.  Now to S. Clubs is the agreed suit  how far can he go?  5@C is not fancied........partner has not exactly jumped in the air with excitement  and he has denied 4-card spade suit. It is decision time. Either pass or ask with 3@H. With lack of intermediate cards I would tend to pass with S hand. |
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT|
spirit1320: What are you asking with 3@h please? |
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: Asking for 3NT with a @H stopper. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


AT|
spirit1320: Why double instead of simply bidding 1 spades? |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: The accepted view is that a bid of one spade shows a 5-card suit. |
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


AT|
spirit1320: Is there an advantage for double? |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: Advantage of doubling is showing good spade suit and tolerance for other minor. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|
^B@2Flaskemand: What is the point-range for negative Double, if any ? |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: Lower range at one level is 7, at 2 level it is 8/9. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


AT|
Jimmy  V: Shouldn't North first bid be clubs? |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: Yes. Opening bid should have been 1@C and now the entire bidding cycle changes. My bidding would be:
1@C-1@H-X-2@H
3@D-P-?  South again pass or ask with 3@H. My choice as I said is to settle for the part score. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT|
^B@2mick357: If I open clubs, I would not have a good rebid because  diamonds would show a reverse. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


AT|
moonjohn: Would not a diamond bid after clubs be reversing?|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: This 3@D bid is NOT a reverse after the negative double by partner. Now the point of the opening bid of 1@C, Without any interference, if partner does not bid 1@D then no diamond fit. And over 1@H or 1@S from partner will rebid 1NT. |

moonjohn: is 1@h a reverse or not in this seq.  Please explain. |
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT|
^B@2lioncub: No it is not reverse. We play bidding all 4-card suits up the line.  Very quickly a reverse bid is one that forces partner to bid at the 3 level if he wishes to show preference to first bid suit. So if the bidding goes as 1@D-1@S the 2@h bid is now a reverse. Partner has to bid 3@D to show preference.  And as someone just reminded me, in order to make a reverse bid your first bid suit is longer than the second and you will have a min of 17  points forcing for one round. |

^B@2lioncub: Bad lead. Never, almost never under lead an ace in suit contract. Lead should be a spade or the Q@C.  Now to the bidding. Don't use Stayman with flat hand and under 8 points. Then you have problem to rebid if partner bids 2@D and you have less than four @D. You cannot bid 2NT and the partner may have only two Diamonds. It is different if your hand is 5/4 in the majors. Then you are able to bid your 5-card suit over 2@D. |
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


AT|
analisals: Do you not advise Garbage Stayman? |
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT|
^B@2lioncub: Nope. I suggest you all forget it. The ONLY shape I would use Garbage Stayman is with 4/4/5/0. The zero being in clubs of course. |

PJKaitala: After 1NT if I have 5 points and 3@S - 3@H - 2@c - 5@d may I use Stayman? |
