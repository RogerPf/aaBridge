Introduction:

This will be a lesson series on counting.
But before I get started, I want to say thanks to the organizers, BBO and the BIL,
who just do an incredible job in making bridge accessible and I don’t know about you guys, 
but I am incredible thankful for this.
They just don’t get enough credit. It’s just great that they’re there and help you get started.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


at|


This first session is on distribution 
The first thing I want to talk about is counting distribution:

A complicated way to count distribution is, say you are South declaring a 6@s contract, and you start pulling trumps:
First round, everybody followed…that is 4 trumps
Second round, all followed, that is 8, still 2 in dummy, 2 in my hand, that’s 8+4=12 => still 1 out.
If you count sort of “1 by 1” (as many people do), that’s a long and arduous process.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


at| 

I am going to show you a much easier way.
It’s based on the idea that there are 13 cards in a suit, and 13 cards in a hand.
If you started with 4 in a suit, and dummy started with 4, that is 8
=> 5 cards outstanding.
How can these 5 cards be divided in the opponent’s hands, what are the possibilities?
5-0      4-1    and  3-2

So, what we have are some patterns.
For the @s suit in this example the possibilities are:|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|  4-4-5-0,  4-4-4-1 and  4-4-3-2.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||fp|1|cp|2|at|^b@2

If the 5-0 exists, that means somebody will show out on the first round
If all follow, we can rule the 5-0 out which leaves us only 4-1 and 3-2
If all follow on the second round, we know it was 3-2 and 1 outstanding  

As there are 13 cards in each suit, and 13 cards in each hand, these patterns are very useful for both suit and hand patterns.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|

Now the next question:
What are the possible patterns for east’s entire hand if we know he started with 4 spades?
In other words, only spades are played so far and he still has 9 other cards. 
What are the possible patterns for these 9 cards?|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|
^*B
9-0-0
8-1-0  
7-2-0     7-1-1                      ^kWhen you start to think about patterns,
6-3-0     6-2-1                     ^kit will help you decide how to play the hand.
5-4-0     5-3-1    5-2-2
4-4-1     4-3-2   
3-3-3 ^*N|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at| 

 
When people are forced to discard, they very often discard from a long suit.
When after one round of the suit an opponent thinks and thinks and thinks before finally discarding a club, 
what does that make you think?|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|
That his hand is probably very balanced, and he has a difficult time in deciding which suit to discard.
His pattern is much more likely to be 1-4-4-4 than any other distribution,
or at least that is a very likely explanation. He was afraid that, by pitching a club, he was giving you an extra trick..

So sometimes, just the tempo of a play can give you some extra indications about distributions.
For you as declarer it may be very helpful in working out the count.
So watching for show-outs, allows you to think about the original patterns that existed.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||fp|1|cp|2|at|^b@2

Other ways that include you in, as to how many cards they have in a suit are:
- the bidding|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|
- signaling count (high-low for even or low-high for odd)|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


at|
- the play of an unusual high card under your honor 
This suggests it’s likely the last card the opponent holds in the suit 
Say you start by playing the Ace first and one opponent plays the Q.
How many cards do you think that opponent had in that suit?|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|
One, a singleton.

An exception to that rule could be false-carding (not so likely) or splitting honors.
In general, when we play an honor, and an opponent unexpectedly produces a lower ranking other honor, 
we may presume it’s the last card he holds, if we have lower ranking honors too.
If you don’t have any lower ranking honors, chances are he is splitting his.

Unless it never happened to you that you counted a suit around the table as 6-3-3-2 or 5-2-2-3 
my suggestion to you to make sure that doesn’t happen to you again, is that you start to practice “patterns”.
And that is really a very simple thing. I take 5 minutes at night to repeat the more common hand and suit distributions:|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


cp|6|at|

"longest suit is 4, longest suit is 5, longest suit is 6, longest suit is 7" 
^*B
4-4-4-1    4-4-3-2    4-3-3-3 
5-5-2-1    5-5-3-0    5-4-4-0    5-4-3-1    5-4-2-2    5-3-3-2  
6-6-1-0    6-5-2-0    6-5-1-1    6-4-3-0    6-4-2-1    6-3-2-2    6-3-3-1  
7-6-0-0    7-5-1-0    7-4-2-0    7-4-1-1    7-3-3-0    7-3-2-1    7-2-2-2^*N|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


cp|2|at| 

Basically it’s memorization, it’s like going back at first grade
The first time I do it slowly, and then I do it again, but just a little faster.
If you do this exercise 5 minutes a day for one week, you probably don’t need to do it ever again.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||fp|1|cp|2|at|^b@2


The basic idea is, that there are so many things you have to think about in bridge, that you don’t want to have the extra burden  thinking about distributions.
When you want your mind open for the complicated stuff, you want to have the simple stuff in your sub-conscience.

Think about it like driving a car…
When you’re in a city you don’t know, it’s rush hour and you try to find your way entering and leaving 8-lane roundabouts….you don’t want to think about “where is the brake-pedal” or “how do I shift gears”…hopefully that is completely automatic otherwise you probably would end up having a wrack.
In bridge it is exactly the same thing, you need those basic skills deeply into your sub-conscience.

In the following hands we’ll see how to apply this.

sk|e|at|agumperz: Lets go back to an earlier point in the hand, where you just ruffed the third round of diamonds 
and you, east are on lead.|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt||up|40|at|now lets ask some questions:
East: how many spades did declarer show by opening 1@s?|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


at|
5
And how many hearts did declarer show by bidding hearts twice?|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


at|
5
And how many diamonds has declarer shown in the play?|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


at|
3|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt||at|agumperz: So what was declarer's entire distribution?
East can deduce declarer's ENTIRE shape: 5@s  5@h  3@d => @c void (5-5-3-0)
So what will happen if east plays a club now?
You get a ruff, so playing the Ace of clubs now, will NOT be the setting trick.
Playing it can only help declarer by making his @cK a trick|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


nt||at|agumperz: so lets play the rest of the hand
with east refusing to play his club ace and see what happens
finchurst: Do we want to force a ruff in south hand?
agumperz: Since you only have 3 hearts left and she has 5 you can not gain control by tapping her
Better to go passive with a spade or a heart (mm: same, see note at end of hand)
try it|

East MUST lead a trump at trick 4 on this layout, otherwise declarer can still make in the cross ruff
and eventually at trick 10 setting up the @dQ or 10
To reduce ruffing power (and entries to table) the @s9 is just not good enough

Q1 does partner have the heart king and how do you know?|

Q2: How many hearts does partner have against a suit contract?

agumperz: Why does that help?

ecolodge: @h ruff before all trump pulled
agumperz: exactly|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


nt||at|agumperz: East has one entry--the @hA
East must use it when she can give a ruff
But how can she know that west has 2 hearts and not 1?
Is there some information|
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


at|
DonnaS: I would have bid 2@h over 2@c
(bidding would mention hearts first with both majors)|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


nt||at|agumperz: Yes!
So east can count the hand
West MUST have 2 hearts because south denied 4 hearts
agumperz: finchurst--can you see how that works?
finchurst: Yes, I hadn't appreciated how counting was so important to defense|
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


nt||at|agumperz: So here is a tip for everyone
At trick 1
STOP
and see what you can count|
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


nt||sk||pf|y|at|mm: the rest of the hand was not replayed again
You can do this double dummy by clicking on the cards
East waits till West comes in with the @c or @s Ace and leads a second heart.
Now East can take his @hAce and lead another heart for a ruff and -1

click ^$40 for the next hand|

^*BPlacing High Cards Using the Auction^*n|fp|1|cp|2|at|^b@2

Last week we talked about counting the distribution.
I gave you one core tip there, which was learn the distributions of all 13 cards in 4 suits.
Learn the patterns. Learns those so it's absolutely second nature.
It will become something you don't even have to think about.

When you don't have to spend your time thinking about "I had 5, dummy had 2... etc", 
if you don't have to think at thàt level 
then there is more room in your brain to think about more difficult or more interesting problems,
such as where the high cards might be.

Now I am going to teach you some simular tips, that have to do with counting high cards.

For this, lets start with the first example hand:|

pg| ***** 111 ***** |


mb|ppp1sp2sp4sppp|at|agumperz: The first notion I want to teach you is that the auction many times indicates the limit of the number of high cards 
any player can have.
Here is a very simple auction:
I want you to notice, that neither East nor West took a bid.|
pg| ***** 112 ***** |


nt||at|What is the maximum number of points you would expect either of one to hold?|
pg| ***** 113 ***** |


at|
Because those players are passed hands, typically, you wont expect them to have any more than 11 HCP.
In this modern world, people pretty much open all 12-counts, 
so you should assume that neither player had more than 11 HCP.
Allright, given that assumption, let's see what happens on the play of this hand:|

So, when you think about it, that wasn't a very difficult problem at all.
All we had to do is: Observe the auction and draw the conclusion that West couldn't have 12 pts.
When we pay attention to what we saw, 
it was really easy to work out the location of the @hQ

mb|1Cppx|at|agumperz: South, do you have support for all the suits that have not been bid?|
pg| ***** 133 ***** |


at|
No, South has a small doubleton in the diamonds.
So, rather than bidding Dbl, which might cause partner to bid too many diamonds, you should bid something else.
What other options are possible?|
pg| ***** 134 ***** |


nt||at|1NT
But wouldn't 1NT show 15-17 pts?|
pg| ***** 135 ***** |

South is in the balancing seat,

So this hand is just perfectly in range for a balancing 1NT

sk|w|pc|s6|at|agumperz: Lets look at this lead..
Here's a pretty simple rule that I can give you which is probably going to be true 
about 95% of the time:
It's virtually never correct to underlead an Ace against a suit contract.
So when you are defending against a suit contract, the preference goes out to lead from any Honor combination you have|

No you're not sure would be my answer.
But maybe you can gather some more information about the location of other high cards,

Let me make a point about what we have seen here:
On the first hand, because west had passed as a dealer, West was limited to about 11 HCP, 
there was a maximum for the number of HCP west could hold.|
pg| ***** 167 ***** |


nt||at| 
On this hand, we saw a pass in a different context: East passed after West had opened the bidding.
So in this situation, East's pass denies as much as 6 HCP.
After locating some of the high cards, it was easy enough to locate the @hQ, as we knew that the rest of the points HAD to be in the west hand.|

mb|1n|an|15-17, balanced|
pg| ***** 171 ***** |


mb|p3nppp|at|agumperz: Before making the lead
I want to help you a little bit with the thinking about where the points are on this hand.
South has 11 HCP
East should have 15-17, but to simplify the math, I assume the middle of the range: 16
Adding our points to the 16 = 27 points we can account for|
pg| ***** 172 ***** |


nt||at|When somebody raises 1NT to 3NT what is the normal, minimal number of points you expect him to have?|
pg| ***** 173 ***** |


at|
The normal range is anywhere from 10-15, but it's very reasonable to guess that his minimal number is 10 HCP
So lets be hopeful and hope they have a minimal. Let's give west 10
So, 10 with the 27 you already have accounted for...that means Partner can have how many points?|
pg| ***** 174 ***** |


nt||at|
3
If partner has about 3 points, how many honor cards do you expect him to hold?|
pg| ***** 175 ***** |


at|
a maximum of 2 and 1 seems very likely.
So if your partner only has 1 face card, what do you think the chances are, that it will be in the heart suit?|
pg| ***** 176 ***** |


nt||at|
25%, the chances are low. So if you lead the heart suit, 4th best, the normal lead, and your partner doesn't have an honor in the heart suit, what is going to happen?|
pg| ***** 177 ***** |


at|
You will give away a trick.
So, in a situation where you can predict that your partner has very few HCP's your goal with the opening lead is simply to be passive, and avoid giving up a trick.|
pg| ***** 178 ***** |


nt||at|
On this hand, the most passive lead you can make is the @c9,
so @c9 it is. A club to be passive, the 9 to make sure our partner knows we don't have anything in the @c suit.|
pg| ***** 179 ***** |


nt||


pc|C9|at|agumperz: Alright, now we can see the dummy.
And in fact, dummy only had 8 points!
So before we go any further we should recalculate the number of points we think partner could have.
Given that west only has 8, partner can now have 5 points.
Remember that we picked the middle of the range for opener? We picked 16
So I think of it as 5 points, plus or minus 1|
pg| ***** 180 ***** |


nt|
He might only have 4, but he might have 6|pc|C4|pc|C3|pc|CJ|
pg| ***** 181 ***** |


pc|D8|pc|D2|at|agumperz: Rather than playing the deuce, I'ld like you to play an honor|
pg| ***** 182 ***** |


nt||up|1|pc|dq|sk|e|pc|Da|at|hillsideer, if you play the Ace on this trick, how do you plan to run the diamond suit?
How do you plan to score the other diamond tricks?
Without an entry you wont, so my suggestion is to duck the first @d trick
Then, if you get in you will be able to score all 5 diamond tricks.
You just play another @d to the Ace, cash the K and the diamonds will run|
pg| ***** 183 ***** |


nt||at|So this is a common situation that occurs from time to time in NT contracts
As to preserve an entry, you will have to give up a trick in the long suit|

nt||
up|1|pc|d3|pc|D9|
pg| ***** 185 ***** |


sk|s|
at|agumperz: Now it's time for south to do some thinking about the correct defense.
So the first thing we must do is count declarer's tricks.
How many tricks is declarer going to take in the @d suit?|
pg| ***** 186 ***** |


at|
5, declarer lost 1 to our Q so declarer will take 5 @d-tricks.
Now, what's declarer's holding in the @c suit?|
pg| ***** 187 ***** |


nt||at|Can we make a good guess as to what declarer holds in clubs?|
pg| ***** 188 ***** |


at|
Declarer has the AKQ and the J we already saw. 
So that means declarer has 4 club tricks, + the 5 diamonds, declarer has his contract ready to go.
If declarer wins a trick in a major suit, declarer will cash out|
pg| ***** 189 ***** |


nt||at|OK, next question:
Given that north only holds 4-6 pts, is it possible that north can holds honors that make it possible for us to defeat this contract?|
pg| ***** 190 ***** |


at|
Yes, it's possible, can you give an honor combination that will allow us to defeat the contract?|
pg| ***** 191 ***** |


at|
One suggestion is A or AQ of hearts, 
Another suggestion was @sKQ, which might also allow us to defeat the contract if you can take a 4th spade|
pg| ***** 192 ***** |


nt||at|Can we tell which of those 2 ones partner has?|
pg| ***** 193 ***** |


at|
No we cant.
I would like to point out before we think further, that before we started this hand, there were a million possible hands, but now there are only 2 that we care about
pard with @sKQ or @hAce, and nothing else really matters anymore.|
pg| ***** 194 ***** |


nt||at|So our problem now is to figure out which of those 2 hands partner hopefully has.
I call this converging on the solution. 
Basically what happens is, I counted the points, and by watching the play 
I now know it's just a very simple choice between one of those 2.
Maybe we should try to find out. And the way to find out is to lead the Ace of spades and get a signal|

Does partner have the @sK to go with the Ace?
No.
If partner had both the A and the K of spades, pard would lead the K
From north's point of view, north can be certain that declarer has the @sK.
So north, if you encourage with the 7, and pard continues a spade what is going to happen?|
pg| ***** 197 ***** |

mc|7|at|Good, and you defeated the contract.|
pg| ***** 205 ***** |


nt||up|28|pf|y|at|agumperz: Let me some up the notion here: 
The idea is add the middle of the range of opener's hand to your and dummies points, 
and that will give you an estimate as to what partner can hold.
The middle range for east (16) plus yours (11) plus dummies (8) adds up to a total of 35 points.
With only 40 points in the deck, that means your partner only holds 5 points, plus or minus 1
might have 4, might have 6|
pg| ***** 206 ***** |


nt||at|Once you know the number of points partner MIGHT have
life gets much much easier.
You can reduce a million possibilities to really only 1 or 2|
pg| ***** 207 ***** |


nt||at|agumperz: Somebody asked if it would be a better strategy for declarer to run the clubs first in order to force the defense to make discards.
On some hands that is the way to go. When you think well hey, if they are to defend correctly, they are going to beat me. Sometimes the best thing to do is lead a long suit and force them to make some discards|
pg| ***** 208 ***** |


nt||at|But in this case, that would not be the best strategy.
The reason is, that when you run your clubs, you will give north and south the chance to signal to each other.
Sometimes, to make an unmakeble contract, it is best to dump a trick early on them
before they really know what's going on.
(Like here, the suggestion to duck the @d trick first)|
pg| ***** 209 ***** |


nt||at|By doing that, you make the defenders guess..
and when they guess, they sometimes guess wrong.
One more question from one of the kibbies was: 
When should you lead a K from AK and when should you lead an Ace from AK?
That's actually a pretty complicated topic, but I'll try to simplify it for you:|
pg| ***** 210 ***** |


nt||at|agumperz: In general, you only lead A from AK against a suit contract and
You only lead an Ace from AK at trick 1.
In the middle of the hand you should lead K from AK.
Then there are some exceptions, when the contract is played at the 5 or the 6 level
You can lead K from AK against a NT contract|

How many  tricks will the declarer have in the @s suit?

No, pard played the 2 at trick 1, so presumably partner doesn't want us to continue spades|

nt||at|If pard had the K of spades, he would have played a higher spade for us.
So therefore declarer has it, and we can count 3 spade tricks and 5 diamond tricks.

pg| ***** 225 ***** |


pf|y|nt||up|24|at|agumperz: There is one "bonus" point I would like to make on this hand, though it's not essential to the hand.
When south took the @hAce, pard had a chance to play any heart spot
Now, should north play a high @h or a low @h and why?|
pg| ***** 226 ***** |


at|
The first question is, what should this signal mean?|
pg| ***** 227 ***** |


at|
When declarer leads a suit, your signal is never about your ATTITUDE in that suit|
pg| ***** 228 ***** |


nt||at|The assumption is that declarer is attacking the suit because HE has tricks in the suit.
So norths signal will be either a count or a suit preference signal. (SPS)
But could a count by north ever be helpful to south in this case?|
pg| ***** 229 ***** |


at|
South doesn't care how many hearts north has...and when south doesn't care (as is obvious here) then the signal should be SPS.|
pg| ***** 230 ***** |


nt||at|So the @h2 should encourage us to think that maybe pard has the @cK
If pard had the @sK, pard would give an encouraging spade on the first trick, and then the @h9 to tell you
"hey I really want you to keep leading those spades"|
pg| ***** 231 ***** |


nt||at|So the key notion here is that South has to count declarer's tricks.
Once she counts declarer's tricks she should realise "If I duck the @h that is 9 tricks"
The second key notion is that south has to place the high cards.
Once you've seen the @s2 from your partner you can assume that declarer has the @sAKQ|
pg| ***** 232 ***** |


nt||at|And because your partner only has at most 3 points, there is no way that pard can have the @dAce
Once you've done that, you realise the 9 tricks are right there.
Better get busy at shifting to a low club.|
pg| ***** 233 ***** |


nt||at|
Now suppose declarer tricks us into leading a club, and declarer has the @cK and partner the @hK
(we know pard can only hold 1)
Is there any way to defeat the contract? Is there any way that south can come to 5 tricks?|
pg| ***** 234 ***** |


nt||at|
No, we'll take the @hAK and the @cAce, but that's it (@hQJ were in dummy)
If that's the hand, the best we can do is hold it to 3 or 4
So one of the goals here when you are playing imps is to defeat the contract.
You have to hope for an honor holding that will allow you to defeat the contract, 
and the only one that fits the bill is the @cK.|

However, because you found out that east must have all the missing high cards, we know it's gotta be right to play the J instead. |

Certainly not, there is only 1 more @h outstanding and we should draw it in our hand.
Why is that important to cash the @hAce and not cross with a club?|

up|41|pf|y|at|agumperz: OK, Why should east lead a low @d and not the K or the Q at trick 4?
Normally, when you have touching honors like that, you lead one of your touching honors.
The reason to lead low is, that in order to develop @d tricks, you need partner to hold the @dJ anyways.
So you might as well lead low.|
pg| ***** 264 ***** |


nt||at|And leading low has a bonus to it, which you saw in this position.
The bonus was, that if declarer has the AJ9, pard has the 10 and declarer could misguess and play the 9
And if declarer plays the 9 you'll steal 2 diamond tricks while you were only entitled to 1.
So the basic idea is, in the middle of a hand when you have to make a shift, you shouldn't necessarily make the mechanical "book" play.|
pg| ***** 265 ***** |


nt||at|If you were leading on opening lead here from the @dKQ, the the K would absolutely be correct.
In the middle of the hand, you sometimes have to use judgement as to what would be the best lead.
For example it might be right to lead a low diamond if your partner only had the Ace and 1 diamond.
Leading low could give you 3 tricks, where as leading the K you might block the suit|
pg| ***** 266 ***** |


nt||at|agumperz: A quick review of the main points in this session:
First notion: When the opponents make bids, those bids show either a minimal number of values, or a maximal number of values.
We started with a couple of hands where the bid showed a maximum number.
The fact that an opponent passed as dealer would mean, that the maximum number of points thàt opponent can hold was 11|
pg| ***** 267 ***** |


nt||at|So when we played the hand we were able to conclude that the remaining high cards would have to be with his partner, because, if he would have held them, he would be over that maximum.
On this last hand, we saw the opposite case:
East had opened 1@d, and as an absolute minimum he would hold 12 points.
We were able to place enough cards in the west hand, to allow us to concluded 
that the remaining honors had to be in east.
|
pg| ***** 268 ***** |


nt||at|Try to remember that notion of maximum and minimum.
Now, to make a bit of a confusion, in different auctions the maximum and minimum shown will change,
We had the example where the auction went: 1 of a minor  - pass  -  pass
and we balanced with 1NT.
On that hand, the partner who passed the 1 of a minor opening bid, could only hold a maximum of 5 pts.
So everything depends on the context of the auction.
That's the first notion I would like you to try to remember.|
pg| ***** 269 ***** |


nt||at|agumperz: The second notion is:
Counting: When somebody makes a bid that has a 3-point range (most common situation: 1NT 15-17)
I have a very simple formula for dealing with that.
I always assume the middle of the range (16)
But, the auction might go: 1@c-1@s / 1NT-3NT
That 1NT rebid, shows a hand too weak to open a 1NT, it shows about 12-14 pts.
So in that situation I would assume the opening bidder had 13|
pg| ***** 270 ***** |


nt||at|Or an auction might go:
1@c    pass    1NT   pass
3NT   (all pass)
A lot of players play that that 1NT response shows exactly 8-10 points, and this time I will assume that the 1NT bidder held 9 when I counted the high cards.
So, by assuming the middle of the range, it makes the math real simple|
pg| ***** 271 ***** |


nt||at|I count them for 9, I add my points, I add the points in the dummy, I subtract from 40 and thàt will tell me the exact number of points my partner will hold plus or minus 1
The point about keeping the math simple is again: There are so many things in bridge you have to think about
so you want to make the easy ones totally automatic.
So just remember to use the middle of the range and the plus or minus 1 calculation, it makes the math easier, you'll make fewer mistakes, and you'll have more energy to spend on the more interesting parts of the game.|

^*BPlacing High Cards Using the Auction^*n |fp|1|cp|2|at|^b@2

Our first session focused on counting distribution
Our last session focused on counting HCP, and the main point that I made was that,
in the auction, the opponent's bidding may tell you either the maximum number of points you may expect that opponent to have or the minimum number of points.
And that's the basis for counting and placing high card points.
For example if your LHO opens the bidding, what is the minimal number of points you can expect him to have?|
pg| ***** 274 ***** |


at|
Right, 12 points.
So suppose you are declaring the hand, and between you and your partner you have 20 points,
and during play your RHO shows up with 8 points, where are the rest of the points?|
pg| ***** 275 ***** |


at|
All the remaining points must be in LHO's hand at that point to be able to justify his opening bid.
Really, counting HCP's is not more complicated than that.
It's just a matter of understanding that the auction by the opponent shows a maximum or minimum for that certain player's hand, and then paying attention to the HCP that show up in the course of the play.
Another variation would be when the auction shows a maximum (for example the dealer, your LHO passes), that would show a maximum of 11 for that opponent.
If during the play that LHO has already showed up with 10 points, and there is a Q missing, guess who is going to have it?|
pg| ***** 276 ***** |


at|
Exactly, your RHO is going to have it.
That's the basics of counting right there.
Is there more to it? Yes there is, because there are more inferences than what I have spoken about, sometimes the point number of the maximum or the minimum shifts.|
pg| ***** 277 ***** |


nt||fp|1|cp|2|at|^b@2

Lets go over a few more points
If a hand is balanced, and it holds 15 to 17 points, what is that hand going to open?|
pg| ***** 278 ***** |


at|
1NT
If a hand is balanced and it holds 12 to 14 points, what is that hand going to open?|
pg| ***** 279 ***** |


at|
1 of a suit, usually it will be 1 of a minor suit.
So, suppose an opponent opens 1 of a minor, and the auction lets you know that that player is balanced, and that player shows up with 13 or 14 points, who is going to have the rest of the HCP's?|
pg| ***** 280 ***** |


at|
his partner.
Because if the player held 15 to 17 and a balanced hand, he would have opened 1NT

OK, with that in place, lets look at the following example hand|
pg| ***** 281 ***** |

mb|1D1Np2Cp2Sp3Sp4Sppp|at|agumperz: Here is a typical auction I'ld expect to see
East opens a @d
South has a strong NT, so overcalls 1NT
North bids Stayman, and south accepts the game invite.
Now let's see how the play goes

|
pg| ***** 282 ***** |


nt||

pc|D4|at|agumperz: How many losers do you see in the @d suit?
3, but certainly 1 fast loser
And if we look at the @h suit, we have to lose the A and the K there too, so that's 3 losers right there.
So to make our contract, we can't afford to lose any more tricks.
Specifically, we cant afford to lose a trump trick.|
pg| ***** 283 ***** |


nt||at|What's the "normal" play to pick up the trump suit without the loss of a trick?|
pg| ***** 284 ***** |


at|
A finesse.
But is that the only way to pick up the trump suit, or is there any other way, certain layouts, that would allow us to pick the suit up without the loss of a trick?|
pg| ***** 285 ***** |


at|
Right, if one player has the @sQx.|
pg| ***** 286 ***** |


nt||at|But at this point we have no idea as to who has the @sQ and what would be the best play. 
What we would like is find out more.
By delaying the decision in trump and playing a few other tricks, maybe then we can make a judged decission later 
(finesse or play for the drop if it turns out west must have the Q)
Lets see how we can go about gathering the information to make the decission

|
pg| ***** 287 ***** |


nt||pc|D2|pc|DJ|pc|D3|at|I want to duck this first trick, why?
I don't fear a ruff, and I want to learn more about who has some high cards|
pg| ***** 288 ***** |


nt||
pc|HK|pc|H2|pc|H7|at|We're seeing the @hK, who has the Ace?
Would east lead the @hK without the ace?
The most reliable inference is that east has the Ace as well
Another thing we saw is the relatively low heart west played, 
If west had the Ace, west would probably have encouraged high(er)|
pg| ***** 289 ***** |

pg| ***** 290 ***** |


pc|DK|pc|DA|pc|D5|pc|D8|at|OK, which player has the @dQ?|
pg| ***** 291 ***** |


at|
East, because on the first round of diamonds, east took the trick with the J
and now plays the K back, that would be exactly what east is supposed to do when east holds KQJ
So, how many points have we seen in the east hand (if our inferences are correct)?
How many points in @h and how many points in @d?|
pg| ***** 292 ***** |


at|
7 in @h and 6 in @d = 13|

OK, are we ready to make our guess in spades yet? What do you want to do?|
pg| ***** 295 ***** |


at|
Play for the drop, becuase if east had the @sQ and a balanced hand, it would show 15 points and east would have opened 1NT|
pg| ***** 296 ***** |


nt||at|Can you be certain that east has a balanced hand?
We are not certain, but maybe we can do a little count in distribution, and see what that tells us.
How were the diamonds devided and how could you tell?|
pg| ***** 297 ***** |


at|
They were devided 4 (east) and 3 (west). West lead a low diamond at trick one, signaling count in his partners suit. 
If west had a doubleton, west would have led high, so leading low west showed an odd number.
It can't be a singleton as he already showed 2, so we know he started with 3|
pg| ***** 298 ***** |


nt||at|What about the hearts?|
pg| ***** 299 ***** |


at|
hearts were 4333
So now we know east had at the most 4-4 in the red suits
could east be void in clubs?|
pg| ***** 300 ***** |


at|
No, because then he would have had 5 spades and open 1@s|
pg| ***** 301 ***** |


nt||at|4=4=4=1 is possible, but if thàt is the situation, will a finesse work for us?|
pg| ***** 302 ***** |


at|
No, even if the finesse is onside in that situation, we are going to be stuck with a late round spade loser.
So if that's the case there really isn't much you can do about it.
The last possibility is that the east hand is balanced, and it that case, who has the @sQ?|
pg| ***** 303 ***** |


at|
west, because east already showed 13 pts.
And as you can't finesse west, you have to hope it's @sQx|

up|28|pf|y|at|agumperz: Before I move on to the next hand, I just want to recap the thinking process here: In order to do this, you have to learn all the parts of the thinking proces, so that you can apply it yourself.
The first notion here is that certain bids will put a maximum or a minimum on the number of points you can expect that particular player to have.
And in this case, the 1@d bid put a minimum of 12, and since the east hand was balanced, it put a maximum of about 14.|
pg| ***** 308 ***** |


nt||at|And that was really the key: 
Once we reasoned that the east hand was very likely to be balanced, then we knew that east had a maximum of 14.
The second part of the thinking proces is just paying attention and keeping track of which high cards appear.
So, in this case we saw east show up with the @hAK, and we saw east's play of the @d suit, that strongly suggested holding the KQJ of diamonds.|
pg| ***** 309 ***** |


nt||at|So this added up to 13 points. 
Holding the @sQ would add up to 15, so our only hope was that the @sQ would be doubleton in west.
So that's how you should go through the thinking proces. Does the particular bidding you've seen suggest a maximum or minimum for either player, and then you keep track of high cards that appear.
And then identify that other high cards can't be there or otherwise it wouldn't fit the bill anymore for the previous bidding.|

OK declarer, what do you think east has in diamonds, to lead the Ace like that?|
pg| ***** 316 ***** |

Yes, probably has the K.
And how many diamonds do you think east has to bid 3@d?|
pg| ***** 317 ***** |


at|
7
So at this stage, this @s2 looks awfully fishy, and the most likely explanation is, that this is a singleton
So if you play low, west will win with the Q and give partner a ruff, 
and you don't want that to happen, so you put the Ace up.|
pg| ***** 318 ***** |


nt||
pc|SA|pc|S6|pc|S7|at|Now before you play another card, count your losers|
pg| ***** 319 ***** |


at|
We've lost 1 @d trick, and we certainly are going to lose the @hAce,
and we've got the @sQ to lose, that's 3 losers|
pg| ***** 320 ***** |


at|
That means, that if the enemy gets a ruff that will beat us.
|
pg| ***** 321 ***** |


nt||at|Now next question:
Who has the @hAce and why?|
pg| ***** 322 ***** |


at|
West, because east would not have preempted 3@d if east would have held the @hAce.
East already shows the @dAK, if she held the @hAce, she would have bid something other than 3@d|
pg| ***** 323 ***** |


nt||
pc|h4|at|If we play the hearts right away, west comes up with the Ace to give pard a ruff
because partner led the @s2 which is a likely singleton
And we end up with a loser later on in spades for -1 (1@d 1@s-ruff  1@s and the @hAce)

up|52|pf|y|at|agumperz: Lets go back to the process we used when we played this.
It starts with placing high cards.
Because east preempted and showed the @dAK, we were confident that east didn't have the Ace of hearts.
After the spade shift, the @s2 looks a lot like a singleton,
so we knew that west would have the @sQT65,
and we could see the danger of allowing east to score a ruff.|
pg| ***** 339 ***** |


nt||at|
The way we worked around that was, that if we could eliminate all the side suit cards
then the ruff wouldn't hurt us, bacause east would be forced to give us a ruff and sluff after he had ruffed.
And so we prepared the hand.
We ruffed the @d, played @cAK and a @c-ruff, and that left east with no more side suit cards.
At that point there was no more risk.|

agumperz: It is not an easy hand, it requires some forthought and some planning

In the balancing seat, how much does a 1NT bid show?|

nt||at|
11-14 (some 10-14 or 11-15, but that's the ballpark)
It shows a little bit less than a normal 1NT opening.
So what south has to do to show the strong NT is double first, planning to rebid 1NT over partner's bid.

it will force west to lead either one of the minor suits for you, and that is just bound to help you|

pg| ***** 376 ***** |


mb|3C4Hppp|at|agumperz: North's double is a support double, 
a special kind of take-out double which is made by the opener.
It shows exactly 3 cards support (with 4 would have raised responder's major) and any number of points.
Your next bid will indicate how strong your hand was.

pc|S3|pc|S6|pc|H4|pc|S8|at|agumperz: Without any information about the high cards, how would you play the @d suit next?|
pg| ***** 387 ***** |


at|
The "double finesse", a 75% chance: leading low to the 9 (and when it loses to the J)
cross to your hand again and finesse his partner for the K.
If you do this, you will score 3 diamond tricks any time west started with either @d honor.|
pg| ***** 388 ***** |


nt||at|But before we make this play we have to think:
Where are the high cards on this particular deal?|
pg| ***** 389 ***** |


at|
How many points has west shown up with so far?|
pg| ***** 390 ***** |


at|
8 (2 Aces). And how many clubs do you expect that west holds?|
pg| ***** 391 ***** |


at|
At least 5 and probably 6. What about the club honors. Does west have the Q or the J in addition?|
pg| ***** 392 ***** |


nt||at|likely...when bidding his suit at the 2-level
so if west has the AJ of clubs, and the @hAce.......= 9 hcp
Holding the @dK would be 12...........would west have passed as dealer?
Therefore, who do you think has the @dK?
So we can be pretty sure, that on this deal East has the @dK
And that means, we should play the @dAce and lead a @d to our Q|

Then we place the cards, saw west show up with 2 Aces and thought..if he has the @dK too, he would have opened the bidding|

pc|CQ|at|agumperz: Again, time to stop and think a little about the hand...
We can see we have 2 certain @d and a spade loser..
We need the @hK "onside" in east for a working finesse,
if the @hK in not in east it will all be a futile exercise.
So the problem of this hand is...how to play the spades to get to dummy|
pg| ***** 400 ***** |


nt||at|If east has both the A and Q of spades, we have no chances...
So we have to assume east has at most 1 spade honor
The question is: Which spade honor?
If we knew which spade honor east had, we would be able to get to the dummy
take our heart finesse and lose 1 spade.
So, how can we find out which spade honor east has?|
pg| ***** 401 ***** |

a good idea is play on diamonds, and see if you can get some information.

So the scenario we are worried about is that east has exactly 1 spade honor.
Which diamonds did west play?|
pg| ***** 411 ***** |

@d5, 6 and then the 7, up the line.
If west had started with 4 diamonds, K765, he might have played high low as a count signal.|
pg| ***** 412 ***** |


nt||at|
So it looks likely east has the @dK as well.
If east started with the @dKQJ + @hK ^*Band^*N the @sAce  would have opened,
but east is a passed hand!
So that helps us, as we can assume that east holds the @sQ and not the Ace |

Yes he could, but if that was the case, we could have never made the hand..so we have to assume east has the @hK.|
pg| ***** 417 ***** |

So part of the high cards we placed in east hands, because we saw them and were able to infere they were actually there (the diamonds). 
Other high cards we placed there because we needed them there to be able to make the contract (the @hK)
So we looked at the cards east had, and the cards east HAD to have in order for us to make the contract,
so we combined those things.|
pg| ***** 418 ***** |


nt||at|agumperz: Yes there is an awful lot to think about on each hand,
but that is why I would like to go back to the point a made 2 weeks ago:
How important it is to rehearse counting out patterns
Basically if you rehearse the counting process and do it over and over and over again it will stick into your subconsience and you can do it very quickly then.
Start to count patterns very quickly, start to place high cards very quickly|

and this is one of the basic secrets of the experts too
the simple things they do in a flash..because they practised them and then the whole proces becomes a lot faster

^*BCounting tricks:^*n |fp|1|cp|2|at|^b@2

The theme of today's lesson is counting tricks.
In our earlier lessons we talked about counting distribution and counting high cards.
And counting tricks is the last element of the things we can count out while we're playing bridge.
When we were counting distribution and high cards, we also counted tricks as part of our proces.
What you'll be doing on any hand is basically all of those things outlined.
The key is to built up the skills slowly, making it so that counting distribution is easy for you,
placing high cards is easy for you, and that it is automatic to start counting tricks on every hand.
If you have those foundation skills in place, then combining those will all get a lot easier and real hands
always involve combining all of these things together.

We often hear that when you are declaring, that when it's a suit contract you count losers, and when declaring an NT contract you count winners.
The reality is that you should be counting both your winners and your losers on ALL of the hands.
Counting tricks is not something you only do when you are the declarer, you also do it when you are defending.
The last part to know about counting tricks is the target:
When you're declaring it's pretty clear to know what your target is: making the contract.

So let's look at an example and see how counting tricks can help us

pc|hq|at|agumperz: OK, here we have a pretty simple basic auction.
South has 15 points and a balanced hand so opens a 1NT, north has 9 pts and a 4-card major so bids Stayman.
South shows spades, north has enough to invite a game and south accepts as a good aggressive bidder.|
pg| ***** 450 ***** |


nt||at|The first thing we should be doing now is counting our tricks:
2@h, 2@d and 4@c tricks is 8 => 2 missing for our contract.
How are we going to get those 2 extra tricks?|
pg| ***** 451 ***** |


at|
If the trumps are devided 3-2 then we can just lose 3 trump tricks and the fourth trump in our hand will be good|
pg| ***** 452 ***** |


nt||at|We can score a ruff in 1 hand and a trump in the other, and that will bring us up to 10 tricks.
So if the spades are 3-2 we should have 10 tricks without any trouble.
What if the spades are 4-1?|
pg| ***** 453 ***** |


at|
Well if the spades are 4-1 we will not make the contract, we can't do anything to prevent the opponents from scoring 4 spade tricks.
So since we can't do anything to protect ourselves against that break, we most simply hope that the spades are 3-2

lc|sqsj|nt||up|12|sk|s|


pc|S2|pc|ST|pc|S4|pc|SK|at|Aren't we going to lose those trumps anyway?

how many trumps are outstanding in the opponents hands?|
pg| ***** 463 ***** |


at|
1 (the Q)
It's a high trump, but that is going to be the last trick that the enemy is going to take|
pg| ***** 464 ***** |


sk||nt||

mc|10|up|16|at|I put this hand up, because I wanted to make the point that sometimes, bridge is an extreemly easy game.
The main key here is just to notice that those trump losers are unavoidable, we have to lose them.
And if we lose them early, all we are going to do is lose our 3 tricks.
If we mess around, trying to take some ruffs before we lose them, you might give the opponents the opportunity to seperate their trumps, creating an extra loser.|

all we had to do was draw trumps and claim.
A question: Should we pull the last trump?|
pg| ***** 468 ***** |


nt||at|On this particular hand it wont hurt us to pull the last trump.
But as a general rule, when there is just one higher trump outstanding, we just leave it there, and go about cashing our side suit winners.|

pg| ***** 475 ***** |


at|
@s: 5      @c: 1     @d:  1  (we can also ruff 1 @d in dummy = 8)
So how many tricks do we need in the @h suit?|
pg| ***** 476 ***** |


at|
4       And can we get 4 tricks in the heart suit?|
pg| ***** 477 ***** |


nt||at|If we can find the @hQ and finesse in the right direction, we can get 4 tricks.
Next question: Now, if we finesse the clubs, will that help us? Will it increase our trick total?|
pg| ***** 478 ***** |


at|
Suppose we gave you 2 clubs, 5 spades and the @dAce, that would bring our total to 8,
and suppose we score 4 heart tricks in addition, because we were lucky to find the @hQ
How many tricks will we be taking then?|
pg| ***** 479 ***** |


nt||at|The same 12 tricks...(that 1 diamond loser is still there due to Ax in dummy)
However, if we take the finesse in clubs and it loses
How many tricks will we wind up with?|
pg| ***** 480 ***** |


at|
11, so taking the club finesse here is actually a mirage ("practise finesse")
If the club finesse wins, we are going to get the same 12 tricks we are going to get anyways
and if the @c-finesse loses, we score only 11 tricks|
pg| ***** 481 ***** |


nt||at|The reason why it works this way, is that there are only 4 hearts in the dummy.
With only 4 hearts, that means we can only discard 1 loser out of the south hand
and there are 2 diamond losers in the south hand, (leaving us with 1 we still can not avoid) 
We wont be able to discard both of the diamonds on the hearts.
Now there is only 1 club loser in the south hand, so we càn discard that club loser on the fourth heart
(and keep the diamond losers down to 1 as we can ruff the third @d)|
pg| ***** 482 ***** |


nt||at|So what all of this tells us, is that we should go up with the Ace of clubs, draw trumps, 
and then do our best to pick up the heart suit

pc|S2|pc|S7|pc|SA|pc|S8|
pg| ***** 485 ***** |


pc|S3|pc|C6|pc|SQ|pc|S9|at|agumperz: Now are there any clues which might help us decide in which direction to finesse the hearts?|
pg| ***** 486 ***** |


at|
There are 2 very slight ones. The first one that we have is that west led a club and not a heart..
If west had only small hearts he could have thought "well hearts are just as safe as a club"...
The second clue is that if we play: 
a heart to the Ace, and run the @hJ, we can pick up a singleton Q,
and as long as the finesse is onside (west), we will score our 4 heart tricks and pitch the club loser in our hand.|
pg| ***** 487 ***** |


nt||at|Suppose we finesse the other way (east): cash our K of hearts (to pick up a singleton Q), and now a @h to the J..
now, if we are lucky, the Q will be onside, the J will score a trick...we will cash the Ace,
but if the @hQ doesn't come down, then the fourth heart in the dummy won't be good
even though we picked the right side to finesse...|
pg| ***** 488 ***** |


nt||at|So we want to take the heart finesse in a way that allows us to score 4 tricks in the heart suit 
any time the heart finesse succeeds|

pg| ***** 493 ***** |


nt||
mc|12|
pg| ***** 494 ***** |


pf|y|up|28|at|agumperz: So finessing the @hQ in the west gives us just that tiny extra chance of scoring 4 heart tricks (even if the Q doesn't come down from west) or somebody is holding that singleton Q.
We are then still going to score our 4 heart tricks.
If you play a @h to the J and west was dealt a singleton Q, then they will beat you when you might have made. |
pg| ***** 495 ***** |


nt||at|So what are the main lessons we can learn from this hand?|
pg| ***** 496 ***** |


at|
The simple most important lesson was counting the winners.
When we counted the winners, we realised that the club finesse wasn't going to add a winner to our total.
(even if the finesse wins, we wouldn't have a club loser, but still an inevitable diamond loser, as we can only discard 1 out of the 2 diamond losers on the hearts)
And since it is not going to add an extra winner, it is just an extra risk for no benifit.
Before making any play that involves a risk, count your winners first.|
pg| ***** 497 ***** |


nt||at|The second lesson of this hand involves the heart suit. In the heart suit we had a guess, a guess as to who had the @hQ.
We looked at how we could create a tiny extra chance.
When the Q doesn't come down from east we can't make our fourth heart a winner, however, if the Q doesn't come down from west we can take the 4 hearts and get a discard out of it.
So when we have to guess, we have to guess it is in a position where we can take the most advantage of it.|
pg| ***** 498 ***** |


nt||at|It is equally likely it is in east or west, 
but if it is in west, it is easy for us to score 4 tricks.

(note movie maker: If it's in west, we WILL score 4, if it's in east there are still a few conditions that have to be met before we score 4)

At this point, lets look at south's tricks here.
How many spade tricks?|
pg| ***** 502 ***** |


at|
5 (assuming they are not devided 4-0)       And how many club tricks? |
pg| ***** 503 ***** |


nt||at|4   = 9
How many hearts?|
pg| ***** 504 ***** |


at|
1 so far if we ruff, but we should be able to ruff a second 1 = 11
And what about the diamonds?|
pg| ***** 505 ***** |


at|
Quite a few by knocking out the Ace.        Is there any danger on this hand?|
pg| ***** 506 ***** |


nt||at|agumperz: Yes there is. 
If we started with the diamonds right now, and somebody holds the Axxx, that person would be able to win and give his partner a ruff, so we sure don't want that to happen.
Another danger is that the spades don't split (2-2 or 3-1 are no problem).
But if the spades are 4-0, is there anything we can do about it?|
pg| ***** 507 ***** |


at|
No.  We will end up with a @s and a @d loser. So lets just get started drawing trumps|

pg| ***** 521 ***** |


pf|y|up|20|at|agumperz: So all we need to do is ruff 2 hearts in the dummy and that's it.
The problem was, that if we drew too many trumps too early
we took out the entry to the south hand, that allows us to finish drawing trumps.
So the hidden danger is drawing too many trumps too early.
So the key is counting tricks and making a plan. The plan here was ruff to hearts and draw trumps.|
pg| ***** 522 ***** |


nt||at|Once you make that basic plan, you have to look for any potential problems.
So the potential problem was, that there was no fast re-entry to the south hand.
And that's why we had to ruff the second heart asap, while we still had a trump in the north hand to get back to the south hand and finish drawing trumps.
The only quick entry to the south hand was in the trump suit itself.|
pg| ***** 523 ***** |


nt||at|agumperz: By the way, don't beat up on yourself if you fail to make a hand.
The only reason I can be here today and teach you some stuff is because I already made thousands more errors than you have in your bridge career.
"There are no mistakes, only learning experiences" :)
We learn more from our mistakes, than from some of the hands we played correctly.

pc|C4|pc|c6|at|agumperz: At this point they made their contract!
1@c, the @sAK and 6 diamond tricks.
Was there a way that south could have recognised this and maybe alter the events?|
pg| ***** 528 ***** |


at|
South can do that same counting on defense!|
pg| ***** 529 ***** |


nt||
up|1|at|How many spades do you KNOW the declarer has?|
pg| ***** 530 ***** |


at|
2        How do we know for sure declarer has the @sAce?|
pg| ***** 531 ***** |


nt||at|Pard played the 2, a discouraging attitude signal at trick 1 
(from Axx pard would not have played the 2)
And when north started with A2, north would have won with the Ace and returned the 2 to unblock the suit.
So we can be certain that north does not have the @sAce.|
pg| ***** 532 ***** |


nt||at|What about diamonds?
Is it possible that our partner has the @dK?|
pg| ***** 533 ***** |


at|
Well it is possible, but if you see a long suit in the dummy like this, and suppose you were the declarer...
and your diamond holding was 109 or 109x
Would you be leading a club or would you be leading a diamond to establish your diamond tricks?|
pg| ***** 534 ***** |


at|
If east did not have the @dK, east would be trying to establish the diamond suit|
pg| ***** 535 ***** |


nt||at|So this is the kind of question that comes up fairly often, 
when dummy has a long suit, normally declarer will attack that suit to try to establish it.
If declarer does not attack the suit, what conclusion can you draw?|
pg| ***** 536 ***** |


at|
The suit is already in the bag!
In other words, that the declarer has the @dK
So we should count the declarer for 6 diamond tricks, assuming the diamonds are running|
pg| ***** 537 ***** |


nt||at|So we can see 6 @d tricks, the @sAK, and if we duck a @c declarer has got his 9th trick.
So the only way we can beat the contract is if we win the Ace here at trick two...
We HAVE to win the Ace|
pg| ***** 538 ***** |

pc|CA|pc|C2|pc|C3|at|and make the killing shift
Continuing a spade is worthless, so the only thing we can do is shift to hearts 
and hope that pard's hearts are good enough that it will allow us to make 4 more tricks.

up|24|pf|y|at|agumperz: East had 8 tricks and needs 1 more for the contract which could come from clubs.
Should east run the diamonds before getting a club?|
pg| ***** 544 ***** |


nt||at|
No, if east runs the diamonds, the opponents have plenty of chances to discard, and they may be able to give each other signals as to what would be the best shift.
If you hold a long suit like this in dummy and you need 1 extra trick, it's usually right to try to steal that trick before running the suit
while the opponents still don't really know what's going on in their hands.|
pg| ***** 545 ***** |


nt||at|So what was the key on this hand that allowed south the find the killing defense?
Defenders count tricks too!
In this case we weren't counting our own tricks, we were counting declarer's tricks.
|
pg| ***** 546 ***** |


nt||at|If declarer would have won the first trick with the Ace, it should not have been more difficult to figure out the correct way to defend.
Pard still plays the 2! You still place the K in east. Because if pard held K2...north's correct play at trick 1 would be the K, leading the 2 back, for the same reason, to unblock the suit.
And if north had lets say K72, north's correct play would be the 7 to encourage the continuation of the suit.|
pg| ***** 547 ***** |


nt||at|There is one last inference which is helpful here:
When you are declaring in NT and you have a holding like Axx in spades and 2 or 3 small ones in dummy 
and the opponents leads the @sQ
What will you usually do?|
pg| ***** 548 ***** |


at|
You duck to try to disrupt the communication between the defenders.|
pg| ***** 549 ***** |


nt||at|Now back to defender's perspective. 
You lead the @sQ, you see small in dummy, and pard plays a spot.
You are not sure whether it is encouraging or discouraging..and declarer plays small
Where do you think the K is?|
pg| ***** 550 ***** |


at|
When declarer plays small, it normally means your pard has the K and declarer tries the hold up to cut off your communication.|
pg| ***** 551 ***** |


nt||at|Now, this time, you lead the @sQ, dummy has 2 small spots, pard plays an ambigious card and declarer plays the Ace..
What conclusion can you draw?|
pg| ***** 552 ***** |


at|
Usually it means that declarer has the K
When the declarer wins the first trick with the Ace, that's almost always because they have an additional stopper.
That's not a 100% guarantee, but it is very frequently the case.|
pg| ***** 553 ***** |


nt||at|You do have your partner's signal to go bye, and if it is discouraging, you can pretty much place the K with declarer.

pc|sa|at|agumperz: Having the AK, you need a very good reason not to lead it,
it allows you to take a look at dummy

|
pg| ***** 556 ***** |


nt||
pc|S2|pc|S9|pc|SJ|at|What should that message from north mean?|
pg| ***** 557 ***** |


at|
An attitude signal: Encouraging
How do you send that message? By playing the highest spot card you can afford
Now lets count our tricks on defense first:
How many tricks can you see in spades?|
pg| ***** 558 ***** |


at|
We're very very likely to have 2, how can we be so sure that the declarer holds at least 2 spades?|
pg| ***** 559 ***** |


nt||at|Suppose the declarer only has 1 spade, then north would have had 5
and pard would have bid 4@s, or certainly 3
2@s is bid with 3 or 4 spades about 99% of the time|
pg| ***** 560 ***** |


nt||at|OK, lets get back to the primary task here, which was counting our defense tricks:
2 spades and the Ace of hearts. Do you see a way to score another trick?|
pg| ***** 561 ***** |


at|
If pard has the @dK, or we can score a @d ruff, that would bring us up to 4 tricks.
Now suppose pard does not have the @dK, how are we going to put pard in to give us a @d ruff?|
pg| ***** 562 ***** |


nt||at|With the @s Q
How do we know north holds the @sQ?|
pg| ***** 563 ***** |


at|
The encouriging 9 north played at trick 1
So our plan should be to shift to a @d right now (NOT continue spades!!)
win the heart, lead a spade to his Q and get the @d ruff|
pg| ***** 564 ***** |


nt||at|What will happen if we cash the @sK right now?|
pg| ***** 565 ***** |


at|
If we do that, we are taking out the potential entry to our partners hand
We need to avoid playing a spade, because we want to lead a spade to his Q láter
So lets lead our singleton|

nt||sk||

pg| ***** 570 ***** |


pc|D7|at|How can north be so sure pard wants a @d ruff, could he be playing a @c instead?|
pg| ***** 571 ***** |


at|
If south did not want you on lead, south would just cash the @sK
South clearly leads a @s to your Q for a reason, and looking at the dummy the reason is clear
If south thought the best defense was to attack the clubs, she would have tried to remove the Ace from the dummy|
pg| ***** 572 ***** |


nt||at|So when ever partner risks a trick by underleading their Ace (K here)
it almost always means they are doing it because they want a ruff.|

pg| ***** 574 ***** |


pf|y|up|24|at|agumperz: And there we go, we just defeated the contract.
If north did not have the @sQ, north would have discouraged on the first spade.
But do you see the advantage that you get when you try to count the tricks?
On this hand here, if you can see: @sAK and @hA, that's 3 and just need 1 more
which either has to come from clubs or diamonds.|
pg| ***** 575 ***** |


nt||at|And the presence of the @hAce means you are good enough for a ruff, 
so that made that the obvious line of defense to go after.
If south did not have the @hAce, it might be better to shift to clubs, hoping to establish a couple of club tricks.

pc|H2|pc|H8|pc|HJ|pc|HA|at|gumperz: Who do you think holds the @hK and why?
Is it in declarer's hand or in your partner's hand?|
pg| ***** 579 ***** |


at|
There's a good reason to think it should be in the west hand
Partner lead the 2, which implies that partner has an honor,
but pard could have been leading away from the K right?|
pg| ***** 580 ***** |


nt||at|Declarer would play the Q if she had the Q
So when declarer plays the Ace, she does not have the Q
Can partner have the K and Q of hearts?|
pg| ***** 581 ***** |


at|
If north had the @hKQ, north would lead the K
So when our J forces out the Ace, and even though declarer is being tricky...
and trying to keep us from knowing where the @hK is, we still know where it is.|
pg| ***** 582 ***** |


nt||at|So this is just a small example of card reading, and you can do this multiple times on every hand that you play.
When you have to figure out who has which honor, and you think about it, you know that partner would have lead an honor from a sequence.
If pard leads low, he doesn't have a sequence, and you can very frequently work out where the remaining honor must be.|

nt||
pc|s2s4sas7|at|And how can north now know it is right to play a @d?|
pg| ***** 594 ***** |


at|
If pard (you) had the @hK, would he have played the J at trick 1?
No, so if north can place the @hAK in addition to 5 spades and the 2 clubs..
the only hope is to lead a @d
Another way to think about it, if P had the @hK would pard switch to a @s? 
Wouldn't he cash the K himself?|

up|24|

at|West was counting 5 spade tricks, 2 hearts, 1 ruff in dummy, so west could see 8 tricks.
So looking for 2 more tricks, west turned to clubs
Because if the @dAQ is offside, it will mean losing 2 diamonds, and 2 more Aces.
So west would like to make it, even if the @dQ is offside (discarding a diamond loser on the clubs)
To not end up with only one @d tricks it was essential for the defense to shift to the only possible entry in pard's hand
the trump suit itself.|
