MM: The recommended screen resolution for .lin movies is 1440 x 900 pixels 
(rightclick on your desktop,select "personalize" "screen defenitions")
Also, make sure you have "widescreen" checked in your windows BBO-version
(If you're not sure about your settings log into your BBO windows version then:  
click the yellow tool at bottom and under the "general" tab check "widescreen" and save)
This will prevent the "cutting off" of the bottom parts or scrambling of your text in these presentations.

If you downloaded BBO recently, you will not be able to get online with the windows version...
You can still change or check your settings: 
Go to your C disc, and under "programs" find the Bridge Base Online folder
Open it and find the "profiles" folder
Open and scroll to find: BBO_Default_Settings 
line 71 should read: WIDE_CLIENT=1
If your setting is 0, change it to 1 and save. This will change your settings to "widescreen".

As an ALTERNATIVE: Open your aaBridge program and simply drag and drop the file of this presentation 
on the aaBridge screen.

fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2zaXXon:  Hi friends, welcome
I hope you are fine
I had some doubts where to keep your attention today :)

I wanted to prepare some normal hands, not catching singleton kings and not making 3NT with 21 HCP...
So, tonight we will declare "easy" hands with a guess...

....guess where the danger is?


Now seriously - you would do well, to take this advice:
Every time the contract you play looks simple - try to imagine    "what could go wrong?"
Once you see a possible danger, you may find the way to prevent.


LadyStar17:  @D@D Join Zaxxon on Fridays at 4 PM EDT for a six board free tourney. 
Zaxxon will host this tourney and make rounds of the tables and comment and answer questions. 
It will be an exciting afternoon. Check tournament listings on Friday @H@H


MM: Many thanks to David (Major_blue) for saving the hands and editing the chat for this presentation!

zaXXon: Exactly - we should be able to ruff high, but only if we protect our @H-honors, not to waste them.
(i.e. pulling their Ace with one of our honors)
=>  we need to play trumps thru East's @HAce  (we know, from the 1@C opening that the @HAce is there)
So let's undo:|

nt||at|fazzzoola:  we can save the @S for later.. must deal with @Cs first
wyoming33: ops have 14 HCP so unlikely West has an Ace but E was an overcaller so may have less than open with a very good suit
shoemad:  count E for at least 6 S for rebid.
zaXXon: Minimum 6, may be 7. He repeated on 3rd level, vulnerable.
Well, most of your comments are correct, still nobody offered a sequence of moves|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |

zaXXon: Let us do it together    First:      @C's out are AJ109|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |

If they are 4-0, we are always down
If they are 2-2, we have easy 12 tricks
If they are 3-1...     here we have to concentrate|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


nt||at|wyoming33: If E has AJx - then lose 2
zaXXon: OK - we CAN lose 2 !
We are playing in 5@C's so we can’t lose 2@C's + 1@H !
You see we can discard our @H on dummy's diamonds,    if we solve trump problem - that is
So, we have to play trumps           Next question:    How?|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


nt||at|msphola:  We do not want West on lead, she might lead a @H
zaXXon: Very good point
You expect Ace in East,    but that is not dangerous
Say, we play small to Q and East wins with a singleton Ace
That's just fine,    East can’t afford to play a @H
We will give later a 2nd @C to west,     but not a heart|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: The problem appears, when we play from dummy to our K,   .....and WEST happens to have the @CAce!
He will shifts to @H's    ... and we are cooked   so....|
