fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|^b@2IMPS vs MP –  SESSION  4  NOTES  - 

Here we are in the week before our final session. Karen and I would like to thank you very much for your involvement.
 
I don't think that I want to write any further notes having to do with IMP and MP strategies. 
You have already received all that you need to distinguish between the two.
 
In the first three sessions we have examined 
a) competitive part score hands, 
b) non-competitive game contracts and 
c) competitive game contracts (with a few slams).
 
I have prepared 16 hands for this Sunday's session. 
These hands are a nice mixture of all three weekly topics 
and this week I would like again to alternate IMP and MP hands with one major difference.
 
This week as we finish an IMP hand, I will ask the players to bid (and sometimes play) the hand again 
at MP scoring and we will discuss what differences the scoring method might make 
in how the hand might be bid and played the second time through. 
Also, as we finish a MP hand, I will ask the players to bid it again at IMP scoring and again we will 
discuss the differences that the scoring method might produce.
 
So, if you would like, you might want to reread the notes or examine Karen's very excellent movies of the notes 
and session hands that I hope that you have all received.
 
I am looking forward to some spirited discussion.|

Moviemaker: Before we get started a few words from Maureen Hall (hallway), Founder/Manager of the BIL 
(BILies retreat and LearnBrdge, BIL Beginning Bridge Program) and the BIL website:  

 |CP|2|cs|1|AT|{^*Hwww.bilbridge.com/ ^*N}|cp|2|AT|^b@2   

where you can find hundreds of articles and movies, apply for a mentor, register for teaching sessions etc.. 
Then there are also the "open" teaching sessions, tournaments in all colours, practise sessions etc. etc.
too much to name!
Thanks to Maureen's ENORMOUS effords over the past 10 years (!!) we have this wonderful spot to enjoy 
and improve the game we all love so much!    @h@h Thank you Maureen @h@h

 
LearnBrdge: @D@D Before you start this last lesson for the IMPS Vs MP course I would like to say
@D@D THANK YOU so much Peter ( Peter51) for all the time and effort you have put into preparing the material 
for the Course and  the homework you have supplied in addition to presenting the lessons each week for 
a very difficult subject.  
A big Task - it is very much appreciated. @H

THANK YOU  so much Karen (Karen10) for looking after the 'housekeeping' and most especially for the very considerable time you have spent making the Bridge  Movies  of the Lessons 
- a time consuming and difficult task . @H

@D@D Is it IMPS or MPts  ? Players should  always check before  playing  - the end game is to try to win ! 
So just as you have learned the importance of checking who is vulnerable so you should pay attention to the  Scoring method being used 
- especially when you are signing up for a tournament. 
@D@D  Enjoy this last lesson in the Course - I am hopeful that Peter will do it again next year. 
All yours Peter  - thank you : )

peter51: Hi Maureen - my pleasure

BID GAME AND MAKE THE CONTRACT
This particular hand is NOT a close slam. The general rule is that if you are really close to slam values,
and you think that most people will be there, then you also must bid the slam.
Going to 6@h with these hands is "risky"

peter51: MOST PEOPLE WILL BE IN 4@H SO IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO BID CLOSE SLAMS AT MP
At MP the risk associated with the slam is all the more reason to stay at the game level.
Even if this hand was not as dangerous, even if it were a close slam, it would still be
unnecessary to go to the slam at MP.
Take the game and the overtricks - most of the time you will still get a nice score.|

Peter51: Generally, at MP scoring, you must compete to the full extent of the values in your hand. 
West really must open the bidding. West holds that very formidable diamond suit. 
I think that if west doesn't like the idea of opening 2 diamonds because of the 4 card heart suit 
then open 1 diamond.  An opening bid of 1 or 2 diamonds gives north a HUGE problem.|

At imps, in a part score situation, it is NOT as important for the players to compete so intensively.

Or would it be "trying to find YOUR fit"?
3@d makes, but so does 3@h !

For NS 3@s makes|
pg| ***** 167 ***** |


nt||at|peter51: BUT THERE IS A RULE THAT SAYS NO WEAK 2'S IF YOU HAVE A FOUR CARD MAJOR
jacquiek:  Not everyone plays it that way....partnership agreement nowadays? 
WHAT ABOUT OPENING 1@d?
sblitz:  Not strong enough for 1@d opening, is it?|
pg| ***** 168 ***** |


nt||at|peter51: 1@d - X - 1@H - 1@s
3@D MAKES
I THINK THAT N-S SHOULD BID THEIR SPADES
tutootsie: How?
kritter2:  Treat north's 4 card suit as 5 because of strength in suit?|
pg| ***** 169 ***** |


nt||at|peter51: THE POINT IS THAT AT IMPS THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT HAND
NO-ONE WILL GET RICH AT IMPS WITH THIS HAND
LET WEST PLAY 3@D|
pg| ***** 170 ***** |


nt||at|MM: - 2@d-p-p-p         (I don't see a bid for the North hand after 2@d, do you?)
- If west doesn't open 2@d but passes:
pass-1@c-pass-1@s
2@d-2@s-pass-pass-pass    NS will probably play in a comfortable 2@s
- An agressive west opening 1@d creates bidding problems for NS too...lousy shape for a take out..
How about overcalling 1@s after a 1@d?|
pg| ***** 171 ***** |


nt||at|Mike Lawrence on "overcalling with a 4-card suit"
Rules: 
1. You overcall with 4-card suits only at the 1-level
2. You need an opening bid or close to it when you overcall with a 4-card suit
3. You need a good suit when you overcall with a 4-card suit
4. You don't have a better alternative, such as a take-out X|
pg| ***** 172 ***** |


nt||at|North has what it takes according to Lawrence
Partner should not have to worry about the quality of your suit (will be happy to raise with 3 small ones!)
Another advantage:  it will also be a good lead-direct
and finally: It might keep ops out of their cold 3NT game...

See: "The complete book on overcalls" by Mike Lawrence.

sk||at|peter51: South - YOU'RE A RASCAL!!      ANY COMMENTS?
Redbird44:  unusual NT over 2@c?  So can I pass there?
peter51: YES YOU CAN PASS
East can first try with the pass (in NT only 1 trick available), but when south escapes to @d
then east must carry on to investigate slam.
IS 4@S A REASONABLE CONTRACT AT IMPS SCORING?|
pg| ***** 295 ***** |


nt||at|NO!! - because 6 spades or 6 hearts are both absolutely cold!!
4@s is not reasonable because east must investigate slam with such a powerhouse in the majors 
and must end up in 6@s
This is a close slam and I think all E -W pairs must be there. 
The bidding could have gone - (with the opps passing): 
2@C - p - 2@D - p - 2@S - p - 3@S - p - 4NT - p - 5@C ( 1 ace) - p - 6@S
