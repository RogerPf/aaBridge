MM: The recommended screen resolution for .lin movies is 1440 x 900 pixels 
(rightclick on your desktop,select "personalize" "screen definitions")
Also, make sure you have "widescreen" checked in your windows BBO-version
(If you're not sure about your settings log into your BBO windows version then:  
click the yellow tool at bottom and under the "general" tab check "widescreen" and save)
This will prevent the "cutting off" of the bottom parts or scrambling of your text in these presentations.

If you downloaded BBO recently, you will not be able to get online with the windows version...
You can still change or check your settings: 
Go to your C disc, and under "programs" find the Bridge Base Online folder
Open it and find the "profiles" folder
Open and scroll to find: BBO_Default_Settings 
line 71 should read: WIDE_CLIENT=1
If your setting is 0, change it to 1 and save. This will change your settings to "widescreen".

As an ALTERNATIVE: Open your aaBridge program and simply drag and drop the file of this presentation 
on the aaBridge screen. 
If you don't have aaBridge yet, here is a link for the download:

@d@d Eventhst1:  On behalf of Maureen and the BIL,  it is a pleasure to welcome Radoslav Radev back to the BIL! 

Rado is a very good friend of the BIL. 
He supported the BIL when it started in 2003 and continues to show his support 11 years later. 
Rado is an excellent theorist and teacher, and the 2012 National Open Team Champion of Bulgaria. @d@d

@d@d hallway: WELCOME back RADO  It is quite like old times 
I am so pleased you could once again share the secrets of bridge with today's BILies 
Having you here makes this a special birthday month.
Rado was a regular visitor to the BIL in the early months  - 11 years ago !  
His kindness and willingness to help and play with the beginners back then really helped to set the tone of the BIL 
- he epitomised  what was to become the BIL's Creed - Cherish Your Partner and Respect the Opposition @h@h

@d@d hope (Nada): Dear Rado, 
May I thank you as BIL No 9 for your generosity and patience to walk me along BBO 11 years ago. 
I am for ever gratefull and for all you have done for all BIL @H@H 
 

Rado:  Thank you, welcome all and good luck

at|Rado:  One interesting issue on the bidding: What do you respond to 4SF   2@s?
Distribution or stopper first?
spinman: distribution   
Karen10: stopper if minor
Rado:  My advise is to bid the lower (cheaper)|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||at|Rado:  So here: 
2@S      2NT 
3@C (good suit)
           3@D

When using natural methods you must keep bidding space, especially when both hands are not limited.
Suppose Margie had:    @sKx   @hAxxxx    @DAQxx    @CQx|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||at|Karen10: Do you play 4SF as GF?
Rado:  Depends on what basic system you are using
If SAYC then: ^*bEconomical^*n 4SF is INVITATIONAL or better and   ^*bNON-economical^*n is GF  (Game Force)
For example:   1@H-1@S-2@C-2@D  (economical 2-level) may still have INV (+)
But:           1@H-1@S-2@D-3@C  (non economical 3-level)  is GF
Nowadays most top pairs use 4SF as GF always|

at|Rado:  Many tables will bid 1NT-3NT
There are pros and cons about real strength of E hand
The @C Honors may produce 4 tricks  50 % of the time
1NT-2NT was a little bit pessimistic but still ok :)
Karen's pass was also critical: Her hand is just in the middle of 15-17 no 5-card suit, no 10's,  4333
So 2NT was a good contract as per real cards layout|

at|Rado:  Next declarer should not hurry to finesse the @cQ
Better duck a @D first, win the @H and after that try  @C!
If @H's are 5-2 and the @cQ wins then there is still a chance,  for now quick entry to N's hand in @d
And if @cQ is ON then she is on till the end :)|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt||at|ACEKQJACK: Isn't 2 NT a transfer to 3@D?
Rado:  2NT transfer for @D is good method, 
but 1NT-2NT INVITE is also good :) 
Because with 2NT transfer to @d, then you should start with Stayman to show the invitational 2NT hand
and OPPS will know declarer's Majors length.
Isabelle10:  To transfer to minor, is that slam interest, otherwise bid NT or pass?
Rado:  Not exactly|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


nt||at|Rado: You may have QJ10xxxx only and obviously 3 of the minor will be a better spot than 1NT
When using 4-way transfers:   2@S for @C    and       2NT for @D
Opener has space to bid in between with good support and good hand  
(1NT-2@s/2NT = Hxx support in clubs       and         1NT-2NT/3@c = Hxx support in @d's)
So thin 3NT might be reached or good slams|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt||at|Rado:
For example open 1NT with:   @SAxx   @HAJxx     @DKxx   @CAxx
Partner bids 2NT transfer with:    @sxx    @Hxx     @dAJ10xxx    @Cxx
Now opener can bid 3@C  (breaking the transfer) and 3NT has good chances
So if you choose to play 2NT as @D-tranfer then an INV balanced hand must start with Stayman
and should be alerted,  not promising a 4-card Major|

mb|1C1D2Sppdp3D3Sppp|at|Rado: When north 1st overcalled a suit and next doubled
That double is still Take-Out.
Doubling 2@S for penalty is usually wrong in the long run.
Partner could be weak with some @H-lentgh so he cannot bid safely at the 3-level if no @D fit.|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt||at|Rado: Also the S hand must give fit directly over 2@S
4-card fit + void is enough to proceed.
1@C-1@D-2@S-3@D for starters.
Holden47:  Vulnerable with just 4 pts I can go to 3@D?
Rado:  Well 4 pts seems easy to pass, but bridge is a game of tricks not of points.|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt||at|Rado:  Now 3@S by Karen and it's Tommie's decision to double for penalties now 
( partner already bid fit) or to compeete 4/5@D|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


at|
As per actual bidding 2@S - DBL further biding in @D seems dangerous
btour:  North can maybe set 4@S, should she push to 4@D?
Rado:  If direct 3@D over 2@S then N may bid easy 4 or even 5@d|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt||at|Holden47:  So I use LOTT and forget how many points I have?
Rado:  points, LOTT, Loser count, are devices to help evaluation, but the main goal in bridge is tricks!
nucks:  Is 3@h an option after X?
Rado:  When DBL of 2@s is for t/o even 4@H is an option :)
kat827:  Is the 2@S-bid a strong jump shift?    How about just 1@S?
Rado:  In competition better use weak jumps to show your hand immediately and to steal space from Opps
When strong start low and bid further DBL or cue, etc.|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


nt||at|
Isabelle10:  In competition is it best to support partners suit if you can, not change it? 
(i.e. change to @H here)
Rado:  3@H over 2@S should be forcing
so 3@D shows the fit and is NF.



|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt||

pc|D3|at|Rado:  Against a suit contract holding QJx(x) lead the Q
Against NT lead 4th best if QJ and no 10 or 9.
Against NT QJ10+ lead Q, QJ9+ lead Q, QJxx lead 4th.
Holden47:  But it was my P's suit - I still lead Q when I supported?
Rado:  Yes just imagine Dummy (west) has K10 in @D
So Q lead then makes 2 tricks for defence and small makes only 1|

mb|1Sp1Np2Dp2Sp3Dp3Hp3Nppp|at|msphola:  I'm in a very optimistic mood today :)
Rado:  Mary what do you normally expect  from 2@s bid by Partner?
Possible to have    @Sxx   @HKQxxx   @dxx    @CJxxx ?
msphola:  Minimum.  With at least 2 @S's.  I should have passed his 2@S-bid
Rado:  With the actual N hand, to hope for a good 4@S, partner must produce @SA + @DAJ which is not a great %|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


nt||at|Rado:  Usually giving suit preference to 2@S promises 2-card fit and about 5-9 pts
So chances for other games such as 3NT or 5@D are also small.

pg| ***** 80 ***** |


mb|d3Dp3Sdp4Cppp|at|Rado:  Very nice deal to discuss with many many themes:)
Rado:  After weak 2 and Opp's DBL should a new suit by responder be forcing or not?
spinman: Partnership agreement  normally it is forcing?
Rado:  Yes  if no discussion a new suit is 1 round forcing
But the question is where we go with 3@D if it's forcing...
If S has a @D-fit then perfect, but if not he will bid 3@S and the disaster may come.|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


nt||at|Rado:  I think normal agreement is RDBL to show strength and no @S fit, willing to defend. 
2NT and jump to 4x to show @s-fit and 3x to be NF
Redbird44:  I play the bid after the X is lead directing
Rado:  Lead directing is very good idea, in regular partnership|
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


nt||at|Rado:  OK next after 3@S West  DBL again, to show stronger hand.
Now E bid 4@C and W must stop and count.
What are the chances for 11 tricks if E had xxxx in @C and zero points?|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


at|
The @sK seems onside, so we may give 1 @D and 1 @C
So 5@C has a chance even with the weakest possible dummy|
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


nt||at|Rado:  Next question: What if Partner has @cKxxx ?
Karen10: Lose only a @d
Rado:  If partner has @cKxxx there are chances even for slam, so after 4@c cue 4@d seems ok
Any way hard to reach slam, but 5@C must be bid|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


nt||at|Rado:  And one more tool
When the opponents open 2@h or 2@S weak an overcall 4@C/@D is leaping Michales
Showing 5-5 in the other Major and the minor.
And (2@s)-3@S is not Michaels but asking for a stopper (based on a long running suit)
It's a usefull tool and not so hard to remember
Just ask yourselves what should 4@C over 2@s by Opponent be? Preempt? Or strong one-suited?  Seems no|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


nt||at|Isabelle10:  Is the second X definitely t/o, or could one leave it in thinking penalty?
Rado:  Yes 2nd DBL also Take-Out
spinman: You said redouble over double... I thought one needed 10 hcp to redouble
Rado:  No I said RDBL should show strong hands and 3@D to be natural and non-forcing.|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


at|
deborahh:   What contract would you be looking for when bidding 3@S over 2@S?
Rado:  3NT    (2@S)-3@S- Partner please bid 3NT if @S's stopped    @Sxx   @HAx   @DAKQxxxx    @CKx  for exapmle.
With no stopper, next step from 3NT: (2@S)-3@S-pass- 4@C = no @s-stopper and no interest, partner may pass with long @C's!
|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


nt||at|Rado: So playing Michaels 
(2@S)- 4@C - (pass) - 4@h      (pass)- 4@S-(pass)-5@C       (pass)- 6@C|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


at|
The key is to start with 4@H ( 10 tricks make easier than 11, 2-card support a little nervous but ok)
Next 4@S: partner has a big hand
A normal 5@H should be discouraging, and 5@C would show a useful honor in @C
6@C =  pick a slam: - pass = better @C than @H-fit :)

5-card fit and a singleton + Ace, even a 4@H bid is possible
Rado:  S should compete over 2@H, DBL for t/o seems ok
btour:  We play Lebensohl, I have no bid
Rado:  Even with Lebensohl, dbl still for t/o  is good.|
pg| ***** 106 ***** |


nt||at|btour:  Think dbl is penalty still
Rado:  Let's think together: W opened 5-card Major ( may have 6 sometimes)
N bids 1NT natural and has a minimum of 2 cards in @H (may have 3 or 4)
E bids 2@H (minimum 3 cards sometimes 4 or five)
So what are the chances for S to have KQJ10 in @h and to bid penalty?
About 0.01% (when some of the other 3 joked)|
pg| ***** 107 ***** |


nt||at|Rado: And most of the time S will have 0-2 @h's with some shape and 3-4-5 points.
So if he cannot DBL for t/o  we surrender without fight for score.
btour:  Yes but I can double with just 4-card hearts and we have more than half the deck's hcp
Where are we going vul?
Rado: Bob, Opener has 5@H's, Partner 2 @H's and the other Opponent 3+ @H's => in the best scenario you will have 3
And in % you will have usually 1. 
So if you wait for your penalty DBL it will come once in 100 years maybe, and t/o is coming every day.|

mb|pp1D1Hp1Sp2Hppdp3D3Hppp|at|Rado:  First a question for N:   Why 1@S and not show the @h-fit?
snorrel: 1@h can be a 4-card
Rado:  1@H is usually 5 cards      (could be 4 very good)
If you start with 1@S then for sure you must bid again constructively to show your fit and the maximum pass
1@S is not bad, but next you should bid once again...(raise 2@h to 3@h)
So if you start with a 2@D cue you tell the story in 1 bid: maximum for first pass +  @h-fit|
pg| ***** 124 ***** |


nt||at|Rado: Next question to S:    Why 2@H and not 2@C?
1@H and next 2@c seems normal: 5+ @h's and 4+ @c's right?
And P may have 5@S  1@h  3@D   4@c?
So bidding 2@C is a normal picture of the hand and next partner should jump to 3@h to show his hand
4@h is a good contact if trumps 3-2  (68 %)|
pg| ***** 125 ***** |


nt||at|btour:  Does north have enough for limit raise?  (diamond honors depreciated in north hand)
Rado:  Yes if he can cue bid the limit raise at the 2-level ( 2@D)
If he must force to the 3-level not enough due to weak trump support.
Give him a 4-card fit and it would be OK to cue at the 3-level.
Yes @D honors not good but still partner may ask for a stopper with another hand and then KJ10x will play perfect as declarer.|
pg| ***** 126 ***** |


nt||at|jkk9175: Is it advisable for S to bid the unusual NT?
Rado:  1@D- (2NT for @H+@C) you mean?
Possible but too big a difference in Major suit AKQ vs minor xxxxx
Say:   @sAQ   @HKQxxx   @dx    @CAxxxx       then 2NT might work well

mb|p1Hpp2C2D3Cppp|at|Rado:  Bidding was good
Instead of 2@D by E , DBL is also an option ( partner may have @sQxxxx  and nothing else)
jkk9175: Maybe I should have said something
Rado:  Yes after 1@H and 2@d by Partner you might compete once.

pc|S2|pc|SJ|pc|S4|pc|S8|at|Rado:  Defense starts good but the @s10 should be inserted
(MM: I think Rado thought declarer played low from dummy, and it should state: "The J should be covered"
Had declarer played low from dummy, the 10 should have been inserted)
Rado: Declarer could hardly be singleton @sAce since partner bid 2@D not dbl.

at|jkk9175: I have a question about covering, I've been told almost always not right to cover, seems wrong here
Rado:  Never use rules without thinking and counting present board
jkk9175: good thought  :)
Rado:  Try to imagine what is the possible distribution and layout
You see that EW deserve 1@S trick to beat 3@C
and when you play @S's and did not get it , something is wrong:)|

mb|ppp1Cp1S2H3Cppp|at|Rado:  So pass-pass- 1@h in 3rd position is possible :) 
Not a bad suit and planning to pass 1@s or 1NT
Pass is also ok.|
pg| ***** 158 ***** |


at|
Then 1@c - p - 1@s is risky...good Majors but too weak
It's true passing 1@c may miss 4M....but also may go to number as now
2@H was good overcall by passed hand|
pg| ***** 159 ***** |


nt||at|Rado:  And after 3@C E sees 4 tricks and must DBL 
(partner probably gives 1-2 tricks)
snorrel: It could have gotten worse, after 1@s I got a little optimistic for a sec and was considering 3@h  
asking for a @h-stopper
Rado:  3@h would be the bid with actual hand + @cK to have hope for 9 tricks with @C running
Now 3@C is normal good hand but not GF

at|Rado:  Just to finish
Remember bridge is a game of tricks!  And of probabilities
There are almost no 100 % rules but you will always have to think and count
Trust your P and he will return back :)
Further trust your team mates and do not try to overbid when 1 bad board in team tourney 
( team mates might bring even better)|
