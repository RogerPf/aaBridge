nt|This hand is a typical part-score battle. At our table NS did well to make +130 in clubs.  They can't make 3NT, so that is the best they can do. I was W and we could have done better if I had bid one more. Our auction went 1C by N, Dbl by E, 1S by S, and I bid 2H. When opener rebid 3C, and it was passed to me, I considered 3D, but decided against it because I had just quacks (Queens and Jacks) and because 4441 distribution is not the best for offense you have no 5-card suit to set up. As it turns out, EW have a double fit, and with a favourable lie in spades, can make or go down one in 3@h.|

nt|On Board 2 we defended 3NT after a 1@D opener and a 3@D limit raise With 13 HCP, opener has a close decision whether to bid 3NT or pass 3D. I think he should pass because there are two important negative features about the hand. The opener's hand is 4333 subtract  a point for that; Also, subtract a point for a hand with no Aces. This reduces opener's hand to only 11 points although I would still open (I always open with 13 unless a singleton King) I would not accept the 3D invitation to game.|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|I led a heart against 3NT, my partner returned one when he won @DK, and I ducked this one.  That way, when pard won @SA he led another heart to my Ace.  We took 2 hearts, 1 diamond, and the two black Aces. 3@D should make, losing 1 trick in each suit.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt|Are there any questions?
A 2NT response is not a mistake, it would depend on your system. In SAYC, a 2NT response shows 13-15 and is forcing to game. However, I would raise diamonds rather than bid 2NT if I had the option, the reason being there are two suits where it would be better for the lead to come up to partner's hand. You will often have a choice between bidding (or raising) a minor and bidding NT. Bid the NT when you have holdings like Qxx, AQx, KJx ... where it is important for the lead to come up to them, and on the others, bid the minor.|

nt|Board 3 was interesting. I opened 1NT, and my partner transferred me to 2@h, so I played 2@h from the West seat. I lost 1 heart, 2 spades, 1 diamond and 2 clubs to go down one. The defense could have taken another trick, but it was not easy for them to see it. I like to open 1NT with 5-card majors, so that when I do not open 1NT I will have either 12-14 or 18-19 HCP with my balanced hands. Not everyone agrees with that, all I can say is that it has worked for me. NS can do well playing in diamonds, lose 1 spade, 2 hearts, and 1 club. But it is very hard for them to get into the bidding when I open 1NT and my pard bids 2@d.|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|The lack of intermediate cards (all values in 4 cards) did not turn me against opening 1NT.  The reason is that if I open 1@S, I won't know how to show 15-17 points after that. After a 1@S opening, I might make a takeout dbl with the North hand, but I would not overcall. For a two-level overcall, I like to have a 6-card suit, or at least a very strong 5-carder.

With the 5-4-3-1 shape, the hand is really a 3-suiter, and Dbl is a better choice.  A takeout dbl of 1@S opener does not promise 4 hearts, only 3+ in all 3 unbid suits. Another reason then to open 1NT = it preempts the opps from bidding :)|

nt|That was an exicting one :) Our opps bid and made 4@h I think we should have defeated it, but I played the @CA which was ruffed, and that gave declarer his 10th trick. I would be interested to hear how others did, were there others who made 4@h?

So looks like it was all over the place.  This would be a good one to look at later with GIB When you review tourney hands, you can click on GIB and ask for analysis as you play it through. I find that very helpful when reviewing tourney hands.|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|It looks like cross-ruff was best I'll write something for the next newsletter (or web site) to explain how to use GIB for analysis later that is, I will if it doesn't already exist now on to the next challenge :)|

nt|That was another interesting one.  My opps played in 3NT by North and went down one on a club lead, if declarer plays on hearts and then diamonds, he can come to 3 hearts, 3 diamonds and 3 clubs for 9 tricks. The auction is also interesting from the other side of the table.  After the 1@D opener, East has 15 HCP, but the wrong shape for a takeout double. It is my style to pass with those hands rather than overcall on the weak @C109xxx suit. however, that does not make it "wrong" to bid 2@c, just not my choice. |
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


nt|Are there any questions on this one?

^*bcanbid^*-> would you double for takeout ?
I would not dbl for takeout because the hand does not have heart support. I would pass and consider bidding later.

^*bsallyally^*-> What else to lead other than a club?
The club lead would be my choice, especially with dummy bidding spades.|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


nt|^*bOld York^*-> How to get to 3nt?
Against us, the bidding went 1@d - 2@c - 2@s - p - 2NT - p - 3@d - p - 3NT.
If the opps do not bid, then the auction might go:  1@d : 1@s : 1NT : 3@d (invitational) : 3NT

^*bbillytheki^*-> Any need for 3@D?
Whether or not 3@D is forcing over 2NT is a good question, I play that it is, others that I respect do not. It depends on whether you mostly play MP (then 3@D is a preference) or IMPs (where the focus is always on getting to the best game).|

nt|On this one I opened 2@H and was allowed to play there. It is very close between a 1@h and 2@h opener. I decided on 2@h since I had a 7-loser hand with only 2 quick tricks. I like to have 2.5 QT to open at 1-level I lost 2.3 IMPs for +110. Our opps cannot make anything above 2@h, and if they bid over 2@h they are likely to end up down 2 for 200 or more. Perhaps if I open 1@h, they might have got into more trouble.  They defended well too took the first 5 tricks.

nt|Our opps played in 4@h from the North hand making 5 for a win of 6.7. That was very well done by them. It is an interesting hand for the East player my choice over a 1NT opener would be 3@S. We were playing CAPP, and my pard bid 2@C, intending to bid spades later to show a 1-suiter. With such strong playing strength, it would be my choice to bid 3@S right away, and make it harder for them to get to the right spot. On the other hand, if they Dbl 3@S, -500 won't be a good result.|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


nt|After the 2@C bid, which is artificial, responder should bid 2@d as a transfer to hearts with the artificial 2@C bid, use Dbl as Stayman, and other systems on. If they bid 3@S against you, responder could use Dbl as negative. After a 1NT opener, a Dbl of natural 2-level bid should be penalty, but of 3-level bid should be negative.|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


nt|^*bdae^*-> Would you bid over 2@S?
After a 2@S overcall, I would bid 3@h which is natural and forcing.

If opener is weak in spades, then South's singleton will be worth a lot, and if opener is strong in spades, 3@s-x will be good. by the way, if you play CAPP, where 2@C = one suiter, then both 2@C and the forced 2@D response are alertable. 

On to Board 8 last chance for glory!

nt|On the last hand, our opps played in 3@c making 4, which seems to be the par result. When my RHO opened 1@h, although I had 14 HCP, I had no bid, because wrong shape for takeout dbl The auction went: P - P - 1@H - P - 1NT - P - 2@C - P - 3@C.
The 3@C raise was a good bid opener's range for the 1@h then 2@C sequence is 12 to 18 since he needs a good 19+ to jump shift to 3@C so, with a fit and 8+ dummy points in support of one of partner's suits, responder must bid again, to give opener a chance to try for game with 17-18 points. I hope I will see a lot of you tomorrow, 11:30AM. If you want info about my courses, pls email shep @ bridgementor.com|
