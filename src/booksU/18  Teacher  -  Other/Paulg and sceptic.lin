fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2EventHst4:  @D  I am so pleased that Paul is back in the BIL and thank him for giving his time and sharing his bridge knowledge with us.  @D

Paul was one of the BIL's first "Open Teaching" mentors - way back when.
He has played bridge for about thirty-five years, starting in a local club and progressing quickly to tournaments. 
His regular partner is his brother, Alex. 
They play a small number of events a year.
Over the last decade the highlight of their bridge has been a trip to one of the US Nationals, 
where they played some of the best players in the world - always tremendous fun.

Paul plays in the English Premier League and has also been the non-playing captain of Scotland Open 
and Women's teams. 
He spends a lot of time coaching Scottish international pairs, and BBO is a major part of helping them 
prepare for competition - particularly practice matches and the partnership bidding tables.  

Many of you may remember Paul from our most popular "Robbie Burns Tourney" last January.
(movie available in the BIL library)  
I am hoping that he will return with some challenging hands for our Burns tourney in 2014.  

Today Paul will be dealing random hands, 3 board rounds, 2 rounds.  
He is being assisted by sceptic (Wayne), a previous mentee. 
Wayne had been away from bridge for a while.  
Today Paul will go "back to the past" and assist Wayne to get him into fighting form.  
All the players today are BIL volunteers who work diligently both behind the scenes and directly with BIL members.  Without their help we would not have the tournaments, movies and practice sessions for our members.

Just bid some random hands and we'll discuss what they did,

pg| ***** 16 ***** |


sk||sb|n|at|paulg:  As always the main discussion is about the auction
Anne, did you consider rebidding 3@h initially?
anba: Normally I would bid 3@H with 6 losers yes
paulg:  I think it's a close decision
But perhaps with such good suits, all your points in the suits you bid, then this is a time when you might bid 3@h
The fact that you have @hAK is often a reason to upgrade, since partner will be concerned about trumps
|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||at|paulg:  Rosemary's double of 2@h is perhaps something that many would not consider
But if you pass and then Wayne passes, then you'd wish that you'd done something
as partner will probably pass out 2@h
When weighing up whether to make an aggressive action, number in their suit is important
Here Rosemary has the shortage in hearts, so she should be the hand to act
So double is aggressive, pass is possible, but it's okay
Bridge is a bidder's game these days|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


nt||at|paulg:  It is risky, but they are unlikely to double you if you have a spade fit
Often, as here, it will push them up a level
The final decision is Wayne's ... should he do more?|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


at|
He has a nice hand, but a singleton in partner's suit is not a plus point
Also Anne only bid 2@h ... so again he has a close decision|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt||at|paulg:  I think he might have made a game try, say 3@c, if Rosemary didn't double
moonjohn: Doesnt Anne's 2@H bid in this sequence show 4 hearts?
paulg:  What would you rebid with @sx @hAKx @dAQJ10x @cxxxx?
'support with support' is one of our maxims
In summary, I think Wayne and Anne have been a little conservative and Rosemary aggressive, Sandy defended beautifully|

nt||sk|w|mb|3nppp|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


sk||at|paulg:  So hopefully I've convinced the kibs that Sandy's 2@d is a well judged response. It's minimum but worth it with a six-card suit
(playing sayc, not 2/1)
Rosemary's rebid is more debatable :)
But she is an old-timer of these sessions and probably recalls one of my other maxims
"Balanced hands open or rebid NT"|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt||at|When you are showing 12-14 HCP, you cannot always have a stop in every suit
....you would like a stop ...but then you'd like 18 HCP too
You just have to play with what you have
For a 3@d raise you'd prefer to have four diamonds or an unbalanced hand
For 2@H you'd prefer to have six hearts, although it doesn't guarantee six
So nothing is perfect and 2NT gets across your balanced hand and strength|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


nt||at|Sandy's raise is practical
If the diamonds run then you'll make a lot of tricks
If not, then 2NT probably goes down
The Italians call playing in 2NT a "sin"
I tend to agree!

up|44|pf|y|at|paulg:  This looks like a sound result
There is a 'standard' lead on this type of auction
On this hand it made no real difference what you led
and most BILlies probably lead trumps far too often...
But this is an auction that asks for a trump lead|
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


nt||at|paulg:  Anne has shown she prefers diamonds to spades
KangaRhu:  why?
paulg:  With two spades and three diamonds, she would have given 'false' preference to spades
As a 5-2 fit is easier to play than a 4-3
So she probably has two spades and four diamonds, or one spade and 3-4 diamonds
So you want to stop her ruffing spades|
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


nt||at|And this is why you lead trumps on such an auction
They have a fit and you want to stop ruffs
If the auction went 1@s-1NT-2@d-2@s,  this does not indicate a good fit
So you would not want to lead trumps, normally

at|
toniluna:  This was not exactly a "balanced hand " ?
Dianne0516: No club stopper
paulg:  Yes, it would have been fitting if Liza also had a singleton club
I think Wayne would have been better advised to continue with 3@h
Now Liza can bid 3NT as she has a club stop and they will bid 5@d when it is the better contract
When she does not have a club stop|
pg| ***** 115 ***** |


nt||at|brmac: Could E have o/c clubs in first round?
paulg:  There is a case for Karen to consider bidding 3@c if that would be a weak jump overcall
The vulnerability is favourable and 6-4 hands are quite powerful
Karen10: I like that better than 2@c
paulg:  note how 3@c would compress the auction
Wayne would bid 3@d and now Liza has to guess what to do, with no heart stop|
pg| ***** 116 ***** |


nt||at|moonjohn: Also make them think about having 2 club stoppers,,
paulg:  I'm sure Liza would bid 3NT this time ... diamond honour and club stop
...but bidding makes life difficult      Note the vulnerability is important 
Karen10: yes, somebody just gave me good reasons to bid :))
paulg:  you also had a good suit .. KQ109xx
Karen10: yes, should get over it that ist's a 6-card here
paulg:  When pre-empting, either overcall or opening, I regard 6-4 as the same as a seven-card suit

up|52|pf|y|at|paulg:  Well done
The duck at trick one was very well judged
Essentially trading one diamond trick for two club tricks
You could have made an overtrick by ruffing the second round of hearts rather than playing the @hK
This establishes the heart suit when it is 4-2|
pg| ***** 152 ***** |


nt||at|You don't need to know many probabilities or odds in bridge
but one of the most important is that a suit is more likely to break 4-2 than 3-3
In fact, any even number of cards will tend not to break evenly
moonjohn: will keep that good point in  mind,,tks|
pg| ***** 153 ***** |


nt||at|paulg:  John also showed good judgement over Karen's 4@d splinter bid
@dKQ opposite a singleton are really wasted (normally)
If Karen had a singleton CLUB instead, then John can make a move towards slam
As ace opposite singleton works well
paulg:  okay, time for the last set of victims|

sk||at|paulg:  For her first hand Fammy had quite a brute to bid ...
Would everyone have opened 1@h and, if not, what would you have opened?|
pg| ***** 167 ***** |


at|
sblitz:  2@c|
pg| ***** 168 ***** |


at|
paulg:  I like 1@H personally
Three suiters are very difficult to bid and you need all the space you can get|
pg| ***** 169 ***** |


nt||at|paulg:  Over 1NT I would make a jump rebid of 3@c
duffer66: could reverse to 2 spades over 2 club bid?
paulg:  1NT denies four spades so little use of introducing the suit
And 3@c is game forcing
so we can go slow over that
If partner then bids 3!d you can bid 3NT|
pg| ***** 170 ***** |


nt||at|paulg:  If partner bids 3@h, which may only be false preference, 
you can bid 3@s to show values letting partner find the right final contract
That is, 3NT with diamond values, or 4@h, or perhaps even offer clubs
So opening 1@H is likely to get us to the right contract|
pg| ***** 171 ***** |


nt||at|paulg:  After opening 2@c we will run out of space to explore
sblitz:  Do you run risk that P might pass 1@h with 4-5 hcp  and leave you to play 1@h?
paulg:  yes, there is that risk
But there is also a good chance that an opponent will not pass 1@h out
......there are a lot of diamonds somewhere

sk|n|mb|2c|at|fammy57:  I don't have enough points to bid on the two level?
paulg:  One of the important points I used to make is that bids are made in a certain context
Here, tammy is a passed hand so Wayne will never play her for a lot of points
So you can bid 2@c here without fear
One reason to make such an overcall is to help partner with the lead|

up|52|pf|y|at|paulg:  I would have played on the spade suit first before taking any ruffs in dummy
You got there in the end but perhaps establishing the spades first would have made life easier
It is a common mistake to take ruffs too early in a hand
Here, there was no rush to ruff hearts in dummy
Establish the spades and then use the ruffs as entries
It's really a case of looking at dummy as the strong hand, despite its paucity of points|

more often now :)
sceptic:  cheers lol|
pg| ***** 221 ***** |


nt||at|paulg:  So as Suzie said, 2@s is not forcing by a passed hand although rarely passed
But 2@s should promise at least five spades
pre empt:  wasn't sure...as learning sayc
paulg:  Most competitive bidding is pretty independent of the system played
maspd: He needed to make a limit raise to show better
paulg:  So the question is what should you bid?|
pg| ***** 222 ***** |


nt||at|You have club support, but only four and partner might only have three
You can double, but really need three cards in both majors
But the answer is quite simple
You have five diamonds, Tammy has shown a lot of diamonds, so you know partner is very short
So partner is going to bid again, she is not passing out 2@d|
pg| ***** 223 ***** |


nt||at|Most likely she is going to bid 2@h, but she may make a takeout double
And that's what Suzie will do here, so pass and then you can bid 2@s or, if feeling aggressive, 
3@s over her takeout doube
I like 2@s myself
Again, a case of taking it slow :)

Great to have you both back in the BIL - hard to credit that 10 years have gone by since the first of the lessons  - thank you for all you have both done for the BIL - Paul with all those lessons, special sessions and team matches  and  Wayne used to also ferret out good website links that had beginner and intermediate  material to share with  members. Thank you both for being here today :) @D@D|
