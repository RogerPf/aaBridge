nt|joest:  It makes sense to just play 'system on' over doubles like this|pg||
nt|meargent: many|pg||
nt|ovncylmz:  dbl=clubs or 2-nonclub suits|pg||

nt|medwards: N-S can actually make 3NT|pg||
nt|meargent: the vul is right|pg||
nt|joest:  A small   of people play that 2@d is MIchaels over a Precision 2@c opener|pg||
nt|meargent: since NS cold for 3nt|pg||
nt|joest:  useful when it comes up.  Not sure what you do when you have diamodns :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|joest:  right.  partner is a passed hand.  How much can he hurt you?|pg||
nt|joest:  I have found out on numerous occasions :)|pg||
nt|joest:  so much for 3NT.  4@h is a straightforward splinter facing a six card clb suit|pg||
nt|ovncylmz:  bets are on for final contract. i think 5@C X|pg||
nt|meargent: after 2@Hs NS were never buying 3nt so 4@Hs is as good as any bid|pg||

nt|meargent: 10@Hs final contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|ovncylmz:  Wu passes on 4@H? wow|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|meargent: wu has a VERY underrepresented hand|pg||
nt|joest:  shouldhe be doubling 4@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: can make if he doesnt play diamonds and hearts in the beginning, pitch hear on J diamonds|pg||
nt|meargent: and does the rgt thing showing once again that i have no idea:(|pg||
nt|joest:  this could be 500 from nowhere|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: they go down i believe zhu has a singleton he is to play|pg||
nt|ovncylmz:  double on 4@H is fine. trusting adam's 4@H is not very good I should say.|pg||
nt|joest:  the problem with doubling 4@h is that it sounds as though you might want a heart lead|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ovncylmz:  not in this auction|pg||
pc|d3|nt|joest:  South should falsecard the j here|pg||
nt|joest:  the card he is known to hold|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|joest:  Wu will then have to consider that Zhu led from 1098|pg||
nt|ovncylmz:  North shows a singleton. I think we care more about competition in hearts more than lead directing|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: plays a diamond and they r down|pg||

mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest:  I suspect we may see Zhu lay down the ace of clubs and hope to score his trump trick|pg||
nt|meargent: i guess the jump to 4@Ss showed a solid suit wishfull thinking on brescolls part|pg||
nt|joest:  is this about 52% or so leaving aside a club ruff?|pg||
nt|meargent: with @Hs 52 slam DOOMED on any lead|pg||
pc|s9|nt|joest:  some kibitzers wisely pointed out to me that Zhu isn't on lead! :)|pg||
nt|joest:  with hearts 4-3 south might have been able to make this|pg||
nt|joest:  and yes this is more than 52%|pg||
nt|joest:  I thought South had but six spades|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sK|nt|joest:  with seven it is very high %|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|joest:  so now you pull the trump, play the top hearts pitching your clubs and ruff a heart|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|nt|joest:  if the hearts go 4-3 you can park your losing diamond|pg||

nt|meargent: alot of sound and fury meaning very little|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|joest:  yeah but 4@d might have been interepreted as RKCB|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest:  yes it is not at all clear (to either player) whether they are: (a) looking for the best game (b) seeing if there is a game (c) investigating slam|pg||
nt|meargent: brescoll better keep his hands off of @Ss|pg||

nt|ovncylmz:  -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: maybe not|pg||
nt|joest:  I think there is some inference that the spade ace is on declarer's left but even if he divines to work diamonds atonce I don't think he makes this|pg||

nt|meargent: the phantom struck in the CR|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|ovncylmz:  grossacks try the highest (sometimes even unreasonably high) level of competition in all hands. this is their style. but opponents still prefer bidding over their highest.|pg||
nt|joest:  bidding over a strong club with a strong hand of your own is always a problem area|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ovncylmz:  i guess they bid 5@H, NS bid 6@C|pg||
nt|joest:  ok this will send me scrambling to their convention card|pg||
nt|joest:  is 2@h minors?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|3S|nt|ovncylmz:  @S or @C+@D i believe|pg||
nt|Psyck:  I would guess suction style - @S or @C+@D|pg||
nt|meargent: many pairs pass on their 1st turn when holding a big hand versus a big @C|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest:  i agree with you Joey|pg||
nt|meargent: i dont like 2@Hs whatever it means|pg||
nt|joest:  passing and thenbidding is the conventional approach to show values of your own|pg||
mb|4S|nt|joest:  right.  Ideal would be to pass and then double some   of spdaes for takeout.  That would bring hearts into play as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest:  but this could all work out b/c 4@s is not fetching meaning Wang is heading for a plus at both tables|pg||

nt|joest:  actually it might go double on his right meaning he now has an easy support redouble|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: the kaplan team must work harder if they want to keep the lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|joest:  i see I got the opener wrong :)|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|joest:  another good slam that goes down although this time it is east-wests turn to suffer|pg||

nt|ovncylmz:  maybe shudnt with 2KC and @SQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|ovncylmz:  but works well|pg||
nt|joest:  if you are playing 'semiserius 3NT' here west should probably pass|pg||
nt|meargent: 6@Ds is excellent especially since the @H KQJ aint on lead|pg||
nt|joest:  if you do that, 4@s ithe worst 3NT is something better, a cue-bid is the best|pg||
nt|joest:  but you don't have enough pitches in 6@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ovncylmz:  West asks in other table. Sorry but I cannot agree at all.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: now the kaplan team will be trailing by a few imps|pg||

mb|2H|nt|meargent: and souths confusion over what a weak 2 bid is|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|joest:  no confusion: it's weaker than this :)|pg||
nt|meargent: brscoll was not similarily confused|pg||
nt|joest:  2@s obviously forcing here.  That is a treatment I like|pg||
mb|2N|nt|joest:  now a forcing 3@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|joest:  2@s forcing is helpful on many hands. Quite rare is the hand where opener, having announced 6+ hearts, should be overruled by north with his own 6+ spades|pg||
nt|ovncylmz:  EW would have put the pressure by putting 5@d earlier:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: no they should have went to slam, but how?|pg||
nt|joest:  to do that East would have needed to overcall 2@d|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ovncylmz:  cannot imagine pass by East's hand|pg||
nt|joest:  if Kaplan had bid 3@c instead of 3@s south might have appreciated his hand a bit more|pg||

mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfe: controls or something|pg||

mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|joest:  i could certainly conjure up hands where it would have been right to but admittedly it is conservative to go that low|pg||

mb|6H|mb|p|nt|ovncylmz:  bidding 3@s-4@s|pg||
nt|joest:  i agree|pg||
mb|7S|nt|joest:  in 6@s the good news is that Kx is onside|pg||
nt|ovncylmz:  i think brescoll thks that he already showed submin with 3s-4s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ovncylmz:  wow 7@s.. so aggressive..|pg||
nt|meargent: kaplan might think 6@Hs implies the @SK|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest:  I think partner would have cue bid 4@h on the way to 4@s with that hand|pg||
nt|ovncylmz:  cannot think of partner bidding 3s-4s with @HA@SK@CK|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: tough|pg||
