at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not much to this hand.  marge did a good job of coming up with a plan for 10 tricks. Just a few small comments. First, in general, better technique in diamonds is to play the honors in the short hand first, to avoid blocking problems. So play low diamond to the 9, then then Q, then low back. On this hand since dummy has plenty of entries it does not really matter, but just good technique in general.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|marge is right. once she knocks out the ace of diamonds, she can take the heart finesse safely for an 11th trick. Even if it loses, she still has 10 sure tricks. Again not a big deal, but just something to keep in mind.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|OK, let us discuss Bergen Raises by a passed hand. I recommend playing Bergen Raises even by a passed hand. They give partner a precise picture of your hand, and make it easy to bid game when it is there. I am not sure why some people do not play Bergen Raises by a passed hand. If you play Drury (which I am not a big fan of), then there is no reason to play Bergen Raises since Drury takes the place of Bergen Raises. But, if you do not play Drury, then Bergen raises make sense.|

PG| ***** 48 ***** |


AT|
moedraznin: And a 3@C by a passed hand would show 10-12 points?|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes moe. Also, Bergen Raises by a passed hand does not restrict partner. However, let me also discuss light 3rd and 4th seat openers.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|20 years ago, expert bidding theory said first and second seat openers needed to be sound, at least 13 HCP. Therefore, in order to be sure you did not miss game, 3rd and 4th seat openers needed to be light, since first and second seat could still have a pretty good hand. However, now most everyone plays rule of 20 openers, or at least fairly light openers. So, there really is no reason to play light 3rd and 4th seat openers.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I personally do not like light openers in 3rd and fourth seat, as it makes it hard for partner to judge when to bid and how high because it makes the range of opening bids too high. But you and your partner need to agree, and even if you play light openers, I still think Bergen Raises make sense.|

UP|36|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|moe had a good plan. I only suggest one small modification. I would play a club before running spades. If the ace is ducked, then moe can pitch his losing club on the long spade and make six. Again, a minor point, but might as well do it.|
PG| ***** 96 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now two things to discuss on the bidding:
First, let us discuss what to do when you have 4 card support for opener's major. Bergen recommends, and I heartily agree, that you should show 4 card support for opener's major immediately  even if you have a long suit of your own. That is what he and Larry Cohen did for many years and it served them well. |
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Basically, if you bid a suit and then later raise partner's major, partner then knows you only have 3. And the difference between an 8 card fit and 9 card fit is important, often worth an extra trick. So it helps you bid close slams and games when you have 9 card fit, and avoid them when you have 8 card fit.|
PG| ***** 98 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I also had a couple of questions about a splinter. The classic splinter promises 13 points. In support of hearts, moe has 8 HCP, 1 length point, 1 quality suit point, plus 3 points for the singleton, using Bergen hand evaluation. So, that is 13 points, just enough for a splinter. In fact, moe could bid 4@D over over 2@D.|
PG| ***** 99 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other question is what should marge bid? With 5/5 in the minors, 2N is a possibility. Most people play "good/bad" Michaels and unusual NT. That means marge needs 10 HCP or less or more than 16 to bid 2N. Since she is in between(13 HCP + 2 length points for a total of 15 Bergen Starting Points), she chose to bid 2@D instead. I would not quarrel with 2N, but I think 2@D is a perfectly good bid. Without the ace of hearts, 2N is clearly a better bid, but with the ace of hearts 2@D is fine.|
PG| ***** 100 ***** |


NT|^B@2
ardythe: Wouldn't 2NT make it more difficult for North in the bidding??|
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good question by ardy. Tactically, 2N might work out better. However, even if marge bids 2N, then 3@C or 3@D by moe is still a limit raise, and 4@D is still a splinter.|
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


AT|
sshmj: 3@C or 3@D is still Bergen?|
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, first let us look at the auction as it was.  moe's 3@D bid is a cue bid over 2@D, showing a limit raise or better in hearts. It is not a Bergen Raise, just a cue bid.|
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, back to angela's question about marge's hand in terms of Bergen starting points. Bergen chooses to use length points rather than shortness points in coming up with Starting Points. Therefore, marge counts 2 points for length (the 2 5 card suits), and does not count shortness. you can't count shortness if you count length, until you find a fit if you use the method Bergen recommends.|

But I wanted to lay claim to the spade suit if I could, so I chose to lie and make a double. However, passing is perfectly acceptable, and probably more standard with my hand.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play. marge's plan was good. My only suggestion for improvement is that after the Q of clubs wins, she should insert the 10 of clubs on the 2nd club trick. Her Q is sure to lose to my ace, so might as well play moe for the J. If I have the AJ, doesn't matter what you do, but if I only have the ace left, then you only lose 1 club. So, the 10 will gain a trick half the time, and never lose an extra trick, if you assume I have the ace|

I have been kibbing Howard's mentoring sessions for over 2 years now. In early days to record the sessions, I used to capture many screen shots (that was just too much work) of each deal. Then merge the pictures and Howard's teaching in a Word document. 

You cannot imagine the time I used to spend on each session. I never got the time to review the work because by the time it was done I had to start a new session. He had three sessions each week then.

Now, every so often when I am up very early (3:00 am) in the morning and would not dare to make any noise--only OLD married men know what I am talking--I get to review a few of my old works.

What you see next is from June 4, 2007. I had to reconstruct the deals from pictures so I do not have the plays. However, each one is a treasure in learning bridge. 

To protect the innocents! I blocked the name of players except for Howard. But, now they are very prominent advanced players on BBO circuit. 

I enjoyed my trip into the memory lane and learned as much as I do whenever I either kb Howard's sessions or prepare a BBO movie based on them. I hope that you enjoy viewing them too. Now please click forward to enter a chocolate store.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let us talk about a slightly different auction. If the bidding had gone 1@C-1@H, there are 2 different bids I can make depending on how many spades I have. If I make a negative double (1@C-1@H-X), that shows exactly 4 spades.  If I bid spades (1@C-1@H-1@S), that promises at least 5.  The reason I can't use the same reasoning in the auction as it occurred, is that neither hearts nor spades have been bid, so I cannot make a negative double unless I have support for  both.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Actually, you can have it both ways.
 
If opener is allowed to raise with 3 card support, then responder can bid NT with only 4 cards in the original major. Then, depending on strength, opener can either pass or bid 3N with 3 card support, or bid 3 or 4 of the major with 4 card support. If in doubt, responder should assume partner raised with 4 card support, but keep the possibility of 3 card support in the back of their mind.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, I find if pard opens 1N, and I have a game forcing hand that is 4-3-3-3, even with a 4 card major, 3NT usually plays better than 4 of the major. Unfortunately, in this hand, that is not true, but in general it is  so that is why I bid 3N.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First, on this particular hand, even though I have 15, it is flat, and I always deduct a point or two for a flat hand, so I feel my hand is only worth about 13.5  and not enough to invite six.  2nd, I am definitely in the minority of expert opinion here, but I don't like quantitative 4N. Whether you make 6 or not rarely has to do with precisely how many high card points  you have, and more to do with how your hands fit together  I don’t play it.
