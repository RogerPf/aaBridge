^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I had several kibs ask me why I bid 2@S rather than one 1@S. My bid of 2@S is basically a weak 2. Since I have an opening weak 2 bid, I have a 2@S overcall as well. That is my usual criteria. Let me give you a quick explanation of my weak 2 style. There are some people who put restrictions on weak 2s, such as not opening with an outside 4 card major, or not opening with a void. I personally open any 5-10 point hand with a six card suit as a weak 2, regardless of other holdings.  I think the weak 2 is a disruptive bid, and so I like to open it with any excuse. |
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, I understand the restriction about 4 card majors, even though I don't agree. In my experience, even if you have a 4-4 fit, the hand usually plays better or at least as well in the six card suit. But, I really don't understand the restriction about having a void. It seems to me the void gives you more reason to open a weak 2, not less. After all said, you have to decide what style suits you best as many experts like to put restrictions on weak 2s.|

joseye: What if partner answers in her 6 card and you are void in each other suit --no transportation?|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If partner is void in your suit they should pass, otherwise you will tend to get in trouble anyway. It is a bad idea to keep bidding on a known misfit, as a general principle.|

TapTap: Always 2 of the top 3?|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


cp|8|AT|   ^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people like to have a reasonably good suit to open a weak 2, but I open with any six card suit. Again, I like aggressive weak 2s, especially if you play Ogust. Now, as to noi's 3@S bid. If partner opens or bids a weak 2, and you have 3 card support and less than an opening hand, you should raise to 3. Basically, you are following the law of total tricks, which says it is a good idea to bid at the 3 level with a nine card fit.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, I like to mention that I don't have any firm restrictions on defensive tricks, although with 2 outside aces I might decide not to open a weak 2 in first or 2nd seat, depending on my mood. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let me discuss my double. Doubles of artificial bids show the suit bid. So, in this case my double of 3@D shows diamonds. Now, what were your thoughts on my double noi? You pondered for a while before making your last bid.|

AT|
mausie: I knew you had quite a strongish hand and short in @hs and you were asking me to bid.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, as I said, doubles of an artificial bid are simply informational, showing the suit bid. They say nothing about strength, and are often done with weak hand but long suit. The most common doubles of artificial bids are over Stayman, transfers, and responses to Blackwood. These types of doubles are good to keep in mind, as they help with the opening lead. Blind opening leads are one of the hardest plays in bridge, so anything you can do to help pard is useful.  Let us play now.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ok, one comment on the play. Sandy should ruff the 3rd diamond high, as she has enough honors to draw trumps if they split no worse than 3-1. It is quite possible, based on the auction, that I have six diamonds, so ruffing high is really costless.

@D@Dnome: Don't forget to play this hand double dummy before clicking the forward arrow.|

nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A very interesting hand to bid. Let us go over it one bid at a time.  noi has several choices of 1@H, 1@D, and 2N. Once noi bids 1@H, 2@S is reasonable by roberta. However, I think sandy should bid 4@H, not 3@H. 3@H is somewhat of a misdesciption. It tends to show fewer hearts and more points. A bid of 4H by sandy is probably the best description of her hand. Basically, a good rule to follow is that if you have 5 card support for a known 5 card suit in partner's hand, it is almost always right to bid 4, regardless of how strong partner is. Therefore, since 1@H promises 5 hearts, sandy should bid 4 hearts, especially because her spade shortness is very valuable on this auction.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|now, given she bid 3H, why didn't I bid 3@S? The 3@S is certainly a safe bid by me, since I have a known 9 card fit at least. But I was afraid they might make 4 hearts, and I did not want to push them into 4 hearts by bidding 3@S. My general rule on partials is that I don't make a bid that will push them into a game they might not otherwise bid, unless I think they are going down. so I rarely bid 4@C or 4@D when the opponents have a major, unless I think 4 of the major is going down. And the same thing is true of bidding 3@S over 3@H. Here, however, noi correctly saw that she had a very good hand once pard raises hearts, and made a nice 4@H bid.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Y@3dogoronan1: On the same argument, why should sandy bid 4@H, pushing N/S them to 4@S?|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


cp|8|at|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Regarding dogran's question, noi was willing to double 4S, so she was allowed to bid 4@H. If you are willing to double their game bid, it is ok to make a bid that might push them into game. I think noi's double is reasonable, because sandy was ostensibly showing a pretty good hand. Next, the bid by roberta was reasonable.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |

robzim: Would it be reasonable without interference? I always am unsure if interference negates the usual responses.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


cp|8|AT|   ^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, interference does negate many of the usual responses.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have to admit, I don't know if 3@S is a splinter or long spades on this auction. Certainly, if noi passed, 3@S is a splinter for sure. Now, the only question with roberta's hand is if she is too strong for a weak jump shift.  I am not saying 2S is wrong, just that you have a very good hand for a 2S bid. Your hand is actually quite good, based on the auction. You have points in my suit, and a seven card suit, and a singleton in their suit. With your hand roberta  I might choose 1@S, although 2S has merit.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


AT|
dee_dee_20: Do you always open 1@c with 4/4 in minors?|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me answer the question regarding what I open with 4/4 in the minors. I told a kib before that 1@D is what I tend to open, but I think I need to reconsider that answer.  I tend to open 1@C actually, because it keeps the bidding lower, unless my diamonds are way better than my clubs. However, many people play that you open 1@D with 4-4 in the minors. And I have been told on good authority that the standard is to open 1@D with 4-4 in the minors.  The problem I have with opening 1@D and then bidding 2C, such as 1D-1S-2C, is I would assume partner has 5 diamonds. So, I am not sure I agree with the standard approach. The reason I am not positive about this is because, since I usually play a weak NT, I would open the hand 1N, and there would be no problem.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|OK, now as to the question about whether sandy should open. Here is my philosophy on that, many of you have heard this before. I tend to like to play rule of 20 openers in all 4 seats. And sandy does not have a rule of 20 opener. I will explain why I play that in a minute. But let me first discuss why many people would open sandy's hand in 3rd seat. They play something known as "the rule of 15", which says if your high card points and # of spades total 15, then you should open in 3rd (and perhaps 4th) seat. sandy's hand does meet the rule of 15. The idea behind the rule of 15 is if you own the spade suit, you can compete effectively. Let us play the hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have had many questions from the kibitzers on whether East should have opened. So, let me discuss light openers in general.  20 years ago, experts did not use the rule of 20 to open in first and second seat. They only opened sound hands in first and second seat, usually at least 13 HCP. Therefore, they had to open light in 3rd and 4th seat to make up for the sound openers in 1st and 2nd seat because otherwise they might miss a game on occasion. |
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, these days, most people like to get in the auction as early as possible, so we all tend to use the rule of 20 to determine if we have an opening hand. Therefore, there is not a need to open light in 3rd and 4th seat. So, I personally like to know that my partner has a "real" opener in 3rd and 4th seat, so I don't like to open light, as I am not afraid of our missing game. However, some people still open light and my problem with the light opener is that I now cannot judge as well how high to bid. That was a record discussion for a passed out hand, lol|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think the auction was quite good. First, my 2@S bid is forcing. New suits by responder are still forcing, even if there is interference. It also shows at least 5 spades and at least 10 points. If I had spades and say 8 points or so, I would make a negative double. Similarly, even with a strong hand and only 4 spades, I would also make a negative double. And as to why I bid 5@S rather than let the double sit. I had an extra spade plus a fit for sandy's first suit. Since she bid 4 spades, I knew we had a 9 or maybe a 10 card fit. And as we were Vul. and they were not, I thought it best for us to bid game. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, was afraid we might make six, but the preempt made it difficult which is the whole point of preempts :) And, if sandy does not have the Q of spades, six goes down on a spade lead. So I chose to be conservative here. If I was more distributional, I would more seriously consider slam.  As to whether or not I should bid 3N, I was afraid I did not have a good enough spade stopper. Basically, I have to take nine tricks without letting West in. So I thought double was a better choice. but 3N is certainly a reasonable alternative. As to whether sandy should bid 4@D,  I think 4@H is a better bid, as that is our most likely game. You should tend to show your major if you only are going to be able to make one bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First the bidding had some interesting concepts.  pam's double is the first thing of interest.  She obviously meant it as takeout, showing hearts as well as the clubs she already bid. However, in general, I play that the conditions for a takeout double are 
a) partner has not bid yet (which was met) and 
b) there are at least 2 unbid suits (which was not true.) So, if Ira had bid 1N or 2@D, a double by pam is clearly takeout.  Since hearts were the only unbid suit, you need to decide if a double is still takeout there. pam's hand might be strong enough to bid 2@H directly, particularly given the auction, and that might be what I chose.|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


NT|^B@2
onoway: I can't overcall with a 4 card suit and wanted to tell you about the @h  as well as say that my @C were a "real"  suit. |
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is not an overcall pam, since you already opened. if you bid 2@H, you are showing 4 hearts and long clubs  and a good hand. |
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| Now, let us look at Ira's 2@H bid, and discuss about whether it is forcing.  I play new suits by responder are forcing. Some people play that is only true if responding to an opener, not responding to an overcall. But I play that is true if you are responder, regardless, so I would take Ira's bid as forcing, and looking for NT.|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Finally, there is the question of what pam should lead back at trick 2.  She has 3 choices, a spade not being one of them.  She can lead a diamond, which is probably passive. She can lead a club, hoping I have the Q. That is also passive. Or she can lead the K of hearts, and hope that I get in and have the 10 of hearts. I probably choose a heart, which it turns out doesn't work out that well. But I am afraid of spades being set up, and I want to set up our tricks first.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some interesting bidding points here, germane to the weak NT. First of all, let me discuss what to play over a double. I play something known as "DONT runouts" over any double, even if it is artificial, as it was here. DONT runouts work as follows:
If pam passes, she is saying she is willing to play 1N doubled (which means she has at least a moderate balanced hand);

If pam redoubles, she is showing a single suited hand (analogous to a DONT double.) In that event I would bid 2@C, and pam would bid her suit;|
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If pam bids a suit, that is a DONT type bid, showing that suit and a higher suit. So, on this hand, pam could bid 2@D, showing diamonds and either hearts or spades.|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


CP|8|at|
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now ally, why did you choose to bid 2@H over 2@C?|
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


AT|
camilleln: I knew Ira would bid spades and thought I would try and get him to pass in 2 hearts.|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


CP|8|AT|
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|CP||AT|But given your weak hand pass would have been better. My double of 2@H is penalty.|
PG| ***** 159 ***** |

IraCT: Maybe I should pass 2@H if you passed Howard.|
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


NT||CP|8|AT|^B@2^*B
hondo717: ^*N|CP||AT|Well, yes, because if you pass, since we agreed that for this hand pam's bid of 2@C was Stayman, I am taking a bid anyway.|
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


at|
onoway: So should I double the 2@s?   |
PG| ***** 162 ***** |


CP|8|
AT|^*Bhondo717: ^*N|CP||AT|Yes, once Ira bids 2S, with 2 aces and 4 spades, you should definitely double 2@S. Further, with weak NT pam  knows a lot about my hand and it is easier for her to judge whether or not to double.  In this case, double is probably good, as they have at best a 7 card fit, and pam has 2 aces  and trumps|
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ira's bid needs explanation too. DONT, as originally written works as follows regarding spades.  A 2@S bid directly is weaker than doubling and then bidding 2@S since either sequence can be used to show spades.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very nice bidding here. A few kibitzers thought that Ira was too weak to bid 3@D. However, based on Marty Bergen's hand evaluation techniques in his slam book, it turns out his hand is worth about 9 Dummy Points. According to Bergen Dummy Points are the sum of Starting Points and Short-Suit Points when there is a fit present. The hand has 6 Starting Points (5 traditional HCPs + 1 for a 5-card holding and no adjustment for overrated/underrated honors) and 3 Short points for the singleton. Bergen allows 3 points for a singleton when dummy holds 4 trumps.|

nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One comment on the play ally. You should lead a low diamond early in the hand. It turns out if I have the ace, you will win the King, one way or the other  and I will actually duck as it turns out.  One other minor point about Ira's hand is I play Bergen even by a passed hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|ally had a question. she thought that perhaps her 1@S bid is forcing.  This is a source of confusion among many players. New suits by responder are forcing. However, new suits  by opener are not forcing. If you have 18+ and partner responds, then opener knows she has game. In  that case, opener must make a forcing bid.  Forcing bids are jump shifts or reverses. Anything less than a jump shift or reverse limits your hand to 17 or so. ally is on the verge of a jump shift in spades, but her singleton heart is not good, so 1@S is ok.  2@S would also be acceptable.|

^C@2^Y@3nome: As added emphasis on Howard's teaching I have decided each week to collect many of his important instructions in one page under "Howard's Pearls"  which we can go over them many times. The following are my picks. I am sure you can find many more.

|FP|2|cp|8|at|
** |FP||CP||AT|It is a bad idea to keep bidding on a known misfit, as a general principle. 
|FP|2|cp|8|at|
** |FP||cp||at|If partner opens or bids a weak 2, and you have 3 card support and less than an opening hand, you should raise to 3. 
|FP|2|cp|8|at|
** |FP||cp||at|Doubles of artificial bids show the suit bid.  
|FP|2|cp|8|at|
** |FP||cp||at|Basically, a good rule to follow is that if you have 5 card support for a known 5 card suit in partner's hand, it is almost always right to bid 4, regardless of how strong partner is.
|FP|2|cp|8|at|
** |FP||cp||at|My general rule on partials is that I don't make a bid that will push them into a game they might not otherwise bid, unless I think they are going down.
|FP|2|cp|8|at|
** |FP||cp||at|New suits by responder are still forcing, even if there is interference.

^-"The player who thinks he knows, because he has participated in a few hundred rubbers, 
and who wants to plunge immediately into squeeze plays and coups, 
will never be a good Contract player.
His parboiled knowledge has not allowed for the general principles of play which
must be the higher law of every hand.
Someone who masters the general principles,
but cannot for the life of him tell you what a Double Grand Coup is,
will win more points than the specialist in the
Grand Coup -for those miraculous plays come very seldom in a Bridge player's lifetime."

^C @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.
