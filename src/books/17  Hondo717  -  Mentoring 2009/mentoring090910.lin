at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, I think pam took some steroids after the first hand.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


AT| onoway: Just took your advice to @h Howard.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| It is fairly dangerous to overcall 1N with 14,  I don't even like doing it with 15. But granted, it is better than a double.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


AT| onoway: Couldn't see another bid.  Didn't want to pass with 14hcp.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out that if Ira bids a suit, that is a weak bid. So 2S by ira shows less than 8 or 9 points. Not saying he should bid 2S, just saying this is the one case where new suit by responder is not forcing, and is in fact rather weak. With 8 or more points, ira would probably double. |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to whether I should reopen with a double. Typically, if Ira cannot double or bid over 1N, we are not well positioned to declare. Clearly, most of the HCP are between pam and I and pam's HCP are all behind mine, so we are likely to lose all our finesses. So, given Ira passed, I thought pass was the best action. One of the few times I was being conservative--very rare for me, as you all know.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to the defense. Why did you choose to discard a spade as opposed to a heart ira?|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Oh, so you thought there were no more spades out. I see. Obviously, had you thrown a heart instead of a spade at trick 5, pam is down 1.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because we are playing weak NT, I now know Ira has a real club suit, most often 5 or more, unless he is exactly 4-4-1-4. If he had a 3 card club suit, he would either open 1N, or rebid 1N over 1D. Therefore, I know that ira really has clubs, and can bid 3C invitational. This is one of the advantages of the weak NT. When partner opens 1 of a minor, most of the time he has a real suit.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, the auction was already pretty much explained.  Once I bid 3C, which shows around 10 or 11 points (I would bid 1S 4sf with an opening hand), Ira, with 15 HCP, has a clear 3N bid.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


AT|
wanda21: Yes there are 2 ways..FADS (fast arrival denies stopper) or SS (slow shows).|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|wanda is correct. Some people play 1S is natural and 2S is 4sf. In any case, 3C is still invitational.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


AT|
IraCT: I didn't think 1S is 4th suit forcing.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Playing weak NT, there is a good case for it to be 4sf, because, since you already showed clubs and hearts, it is rare that you have a 4 card spade suit. Of course, you had the one exception hand, lol. But in general you will have 4 hearts and 5+ clubs, which makes your having 4 spades very unlikely.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


AT|
IraCT: Good to know I was going to bid 4S over 1S rebid by you.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let's look at ira's declarer planning. Once he wins the first spade, he can count 3 spades, 2 clubs and 2 diamonds for sure. If the Q of hearts is in pam's hand, he can count 2 heart tricks. And if it is not, he still has 1 heart tricks, and will often get an extra club, if they are 3-3 or there is a doubleton club honor. So, a heart was a good play at trick 2.  Now, once he plays a club and wbaker splits his honors, he is guaranteed 3 club tricks, so he made the correct change in plan by going after clubs.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, although you should plan, you need to also be flexible and change plans when the situation warrants as in this case. wbaker should not split, particularly in this case. In general, as you know 2nd hand low is my motto :) And in this case, it is likely pam would be able to beat the 6 of clubs if Ira played it, so splitting has little upside.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This was  a very interesting declarer planning hand. Declarer has 2 spades and a heart loser. So, it comes down to eliminating the possible diamond loser. First of all, there is a good chance there is no diamond loser, since if diamonds are 3-3 or the J is singleton or doubleton, declarer has no losers. Therefore, the simplest line is to just hope diamonds behave, which is a little over 50%. However, if wbaker had been slightly more careful with the entries he almost found another good line. |
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If he had played the 7 of spades instead of the J on the 2nd spade, he would have had an extra entry to dummy  and then he could have set up the 10 of clubs for a diamond pitch. So, the point is, the contract had some extra plays with careful entry planning.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very interesting hand. First let's talk about the bidding. We will get to the play after. Very hard hand to play. As to the bidding. The first two bids are standard. There are some implications about my bid. I am basically showing the same 3S bid I would have had if lisa had passed--4 card support and less than a limit raise. If I had a limit raise, I would have bid 3H as that is a "cue bid" of lisa's known suit. Granted, I have a really bad 3S bid, but I figured jana was short in hearts since I had so many. |
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So double (which is stolen bid, saying I intended to bid 2S, or even pass are also acceptable. I think darlene should bid 4H rather than 4D. she knows they have a 9 card fit. If lisa happens to have diamonds, they might even be making 6 due to the double fit.|
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


AT|
cavalier2: Why not bid 2 hearts rather than 2 spades?|
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because 2S is more descriptive. 2S describes a two suiter. Given lisa bid 2S, I think darlene can bid 4H.|
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to the play. This is a hard hand. But the best bet is to probably try and set up clubs before losing control of the hand. So, play ace of clubs and a club. Then play ace of hearts and heart to the board, ruff another club. Then you end up losing just 1 heart, 1 spade, and 1 diamond. That technique, where you set up dummy, is known as a "dummy reversal."|
PG| ***** 96 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Psychologically, setting up dummy is harder to see than setting up your hand. I have done experiments where I have students play the same hand out, but switch which hand is declarer. Inevitably, on hands like these, if east had been declarer, the hand is better played than when west is declarer. Interesting psychology, for some reason, setting up dummy is harder to visualize.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, another interesting hand, and darlene has certainly had some challenges tonight. 1N is clearly not the right bid over 1H, even playing 2 over 1. It denies 4+ spades. In this case, darlene has a very good hand. granted, the 1H opener makes it worse, but still it is a very nice hand. It turns out with slightly better breaks, 3S makes easily despite the void in pard's hand. Theoretically, you should be in game, but the misfit really hurts.|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think 3S down 1 would probably be a pretty good result. Many other people would go overboard and get doubled. On the other hand, it does turn out that clubs is a better contract, although I am not sure you do much better in 4C, since lisa has so many losing hearts. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another tough hand. I think we have to ban 2 suiters for lisa, as her pard's never have fits for her. Let us talk about the bidding first. Once lisa bids 2D, I think jana should just bid 2H. 2N should be a bit stronger, say at least 10 or so. As to the play, there are several alternatives. jana has 3 spade losers, based on darlene's excellent lead (not sure I would have found it). So she can only afford to lose one more trick. |
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Her best bet is to lead a heart to the Q at trick 3, and play the J of clubs, if she wants to try and set up clubs. If I have no worse than Qxx of clubs, she will take 4 clubs, 3 hearts a diamond and a spade for 9 tricks. So playing clubs was right, but because of her spade losers, she has to hope I have the Q of clubs. |
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As even if hearts break 3-3 she gets 5 hearts, 2 diamonds (if the finesse works) and 1 spade, so she is still short a trick. Playing the red suits is lower percentage (3-3 break plus finesse) and doesn't even help. The club play was correct, just did it from the wrong hand. I should say that these have been extremely difficult hands to play, it is lisa's fault, lol, even though she has been dummy.|
