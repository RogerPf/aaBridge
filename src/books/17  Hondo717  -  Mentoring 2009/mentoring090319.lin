^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Difficult contract. Why did you choose not to open 2@S originally ira?|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


AT|
IraCT: Would you open 1@S|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, 2@S.  My philosophy is, there is no gap between 2S and 1@S. With a six card suit, you either have to open 1@S or 2@S.  You cannot pass if not sure. That is just a matter of style. But the point of preempting is higher risk higher reward. However, many experts would pass with your hand, particularly because of your heart suit.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


AT|
IraCT: ok   thanks   I did consider all 3 before bidding and felt I could always come in and bid 2@S.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is true, that Ira could bid 2@S later. However, the preempt then loses much of its effectiveness, because the opponents have had a chance to communicate. The idea behind a preempt is to disrupt the opponents' communications, and coming in later does not do that as much.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


AT|
IraCT: Howard did you consider raising my spades. Would you have if I opened 2@S?|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason I did not raise to 3@S is because I only had 4 points, they were quacks, and 3 of the points were in moe's suits. Even if ira opened 2@S, and moe had passed, I might not bid 3@S, although I might.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, once moe reverses, des realizes it is likely their side has game. Now, back to what des should do over 3@D. She knows, because moe reversed, there are enough points for game. the question is, what suit or NT?  3@S is best, because it caters to 3N as a possible contract. Cue bids are often very good bids, and often overlooked. When you are not sure what to bid, always consider a cue bid if it is appropriate.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


AT|
aspiring: So, because moe did not bid 2nt can I assume he might have a @s stopper in hand?|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|des asks a good question. Since moe had a strong hand, yet did not bid NT, it is less likely that moe has a spade stopper. However, des might as well try for 3N just in case. But if she had to guess, it is a good guess that moe does not have a stopper.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


AT|
IraCT: Does my bid show a hand too strong for a 2@S opener?|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me address what does the delayed 2S bid mean. For most people, I would assume that shows a hand with an outside 4 card major.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since I like to open weak 2@s even with an outside major, that delay does not have any special meaning to me.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


AT|
aspiring: Howard should I have left the contract in 4@h.  I know moe does not have 4 hearts in his hand so at best we have a 7 card fit but we have an 8 card fit in @c.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No des, 5@C was a good bid  particularly since your hearts were not very good. Sometimes you can play in a 7 card fit, but usually not a good idea with a weak suit. And, your 4@H bid was very good moe. perfect description of your hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us first discuss my double, then ira's bid. My 2 choices are double and 3@C. B because I had a pretty strong hand, I decided to double. If ira jumps to 4@H, even if he only has a 4 card suit, since my hearts are strong, decided that would be ok. Next, let us look at ira's choices. They are 4@H or 3N. Because he has such good spades and not such great hearts, his 3N bid was very good. well thought out.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


AT|
PSz: Howard . Why not 3@h bid for Ira?|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Too strong. He either has to bid 4@H or 3N.  3@H can be passed.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play of the hand, ira did a nice job of listening to the auction. He knows that des only has 2 spades, so no need to duck, as long as he can keep moe off lead.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


AT|
aspiring: Should moe have lead a spade or top of nothing he knows I don"t have spade support and he knows ira has spades stopped?|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I tend to like to lead my best suit. Some experts would say moe should lead something else and not give away a trick. The problem with des's argument is you lose what is known as a "tempo" buy delaying leading spades.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


AT|
aspiring: I know what his suit is by his bid and so often that gives a free trick.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The tradeoff is, is the loss in tempo worth the possibility of a free trick. If ira had to set up diamonds, for example, then moe's spades might very well have been set up.  I tend to lead my suit. The opponents sometimes are under pressure and bid 3N with tenuous stoppers. Rarely does the spade lead establish the ninth trick. if it gives away an overtrick, doesnt matter. Only matters if it is exactly the ninth trick.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have to be careful here to set up tricks without losing control of diamonds. The problem here is I have to come to 10 tricks, but cannot draw trumps without worrying about losing diamonds.  I can count six hearts, one diamond, and 2 spades for nine tricks, plus a diamond ruff for 10.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, on this particular hand, I would have just bid 4h with ira's hand. However, ira was justifiably cautious, having seen many of my "creative" weak 2s.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |

mausie: I was told that feature asking is better than Ogust, as ogust takes up too much bidding room.  Your thought please? |
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think ogust is way better. The argument about it taking up too much room makes little sense to me, since you only take  up a lot of room with a better hand.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me briefly discuss Ogust, which I strongly prefer over feature. The 2N bid by ira asks me for a further description of my hand. There are 2 aspects to my hand that I describe.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


AT|
- The first is suit quality. A good suit is defined as having 2 of the top 3 honors.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


AT|
- The second aspect is point count. a good hand is considered 8-10 points.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


AT|

So, my response to 2N describes both my points and suit quality.  |
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|- 3@S shows a good hand (8+) and good suit. |
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


AT|
- 3@C shows the worst hand I can have, a bad suit and a bad hand.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


AT|
- 3D shows a bad hand and a good suit.|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


AT|
- 3H shows a good hand and a bad suit.|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


AT|

Many of my partners claim they don't bother with ogust because I always bid 3@C. |
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


NT||AT|^B@2  
EddyHaskel: Do you ever reevaluate using Bergen Points in this case?|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have not really thought about using Bergen hand evaluation with Ogust. Although partner often is aiming for game in your suit, sometimes they are aiming for 3N. So at this point, I guess I would use straight HCP to do hand evaluation. good is 8-10 bad is 5-7.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The main point of this hand is what East should do in pass out seat. In the old days, des could have made a penalty double with her hand. However, these days a double by des is negative. That is obviously generally a better use of double, because negative double hands come up much more frequently than penalty doubles. However,  lack of penalty double puts some obligation on the opening bidder. If they are short of the overcaller's suit, they should double, to protect in case partner has a penalty double.|
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although, ostensibly a double by East is a balancing takeout double, asking partner to bid their best suit/ In this case, des can convert it to a penalty double. So on this hand, east should have doubled, and west would have passed, and they would have done very well.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Before getting into the bidding, let me discuss the opening lead. The appropriate lead from a suit with J108 is the J. In a suit contract you tend to lead the top of an honor sequence. With AK or KQ it can be a 2 card sequence. With QJ or J10 there is some disagreement. Everyone plays you lead Q from QJ10 or QJ9 and J from J109 or J108. However, from QJx and J10x some people now play you can lead the top of the sequence in a suit contract only. Next, as as to the bidding and mausie's question whether lisa could open 1NT with two doubletons.|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It used to be the ACBL had strict requirements about 1N openers, but I know that has changed, and I am not sure what the current rules are. I think these days, as long as you have no private agreement, you can open 1N with 2 doubletons or a singleton, I don't particularly care for that, I think it should be announced, but I am not sure it has to be. Therefore, lisa could open 1Nt. She could open 1@C and then either bid 1NT, 2@d or 2@c. |
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I guess 2@C would be my 3rd choice. If playing with a strong partner I would bid 2@D with lisa's hand, with a weaker partner would bid 1N.|

analisals: Wouldn't 2 diamonds be a reverse ?|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes lisa, 2@D would be a reverse. You are right on the border of a reverse. It is a stretch. But 2@C is an underbid in the other direction. According to Bergen rules, you are one point short of a reverse, because he reverses with 17, if you use his evaluation system. You have a "good 16", however.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let us discuss the bidding sequence in light of new minor forcing. If dave bids 2@C over 1N (new minor forcing), that shows an invitational or game forcing hand. The sequence he chose says he wants to play in either 2@H or 2@S. So judy must either pass or bid 2@S. I am  just discussing the difference between your sequence and your bidding 2@C.  dave's sequence is one of the rare cases where a new suit by responder is not forcing.  judy can pass 2@H. Now as to the defense.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First, lisa needs to save her hearts, because of the auction. Remember, you need to listen to the auction for clues on how to defend. lisa knows from the auction that dave has 4 hearts at least, so it is important that she saves them. If she does that, he probably only makes 2 because dave cannot set up his suit.|

nome: The double dummy feature is on on this board as well. Try to play the hand as Howard suggested by not discarding a heart at trick 5.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A few things to discuss. first the bidding. lisa, should bid  1@S over 1@D. After 1H bid by judy as to when to raise with 3 card support when it goes 1 minor and partner bids 1 of a major. You can raise with 3 card support, when you have 3 to an honor, and shortness somewhere. Cannot make a support double as dave did not bid. I have an optional 2@H bid. Other choices are 1N and 2@D. And cases could be made for all of those bids. I chose 2@H as the most encouraging bid, because I have a pretty strong opener for a min hand. So, don't be afraid to raise one to two with 3 card support, if you feel your hand is suitable for play in a suit.|
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Back to the play. Once trumps don't break, judy has to be afraid of "losing control", running out of trumps before setting up clubs and diamonds. It was smart for her to play clubs. However, after trick 6 she should then play diamonds to knock out the K before drawing trumps. The idea is, she can keep a trump in dummy, so if they lead spades, she can ruff in dummy and not shorten her own trumps. That is how to make the hand.|

^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.  

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N|
