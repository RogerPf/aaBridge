at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very well played. The first thing is the bidding. john, you should overcall 2C not 1@S. 1S bid promises 5 cards in the suit  and your clubs are very good.  Once john overcalls 1S, the hand looks like a misfit to me, so I have a clear pass. However, after he bids 3C, it looks like they may have a club fit and we have a diamond fit, so I chose to bid 3D. Although my hand was weak, the singleton club and doubleton heart in back of john (who would be short), as well as the spades in back of john, were plusses. But, 3D was a real stretch.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3N by lisa was a good bid. 4D was a stretch by jana, but it worked out, due to her excellent declarer play. As to the defense. If you think you have the majority of the points, and it looks like there is shortness in both hands trumps are often good to lead. So, when jana plays a trump, lisa should consider rising with her ace (yes, I know that violates my 2nd hand low rule :)) and playing another trump to cut down on ruffs. Nevertheless, the hand is tough hand to defend.|

And he has no idea my clubs are that good. So, I assumed he did not have the ace of clubs and played the 10 of clubs safely. Even if it lost to the J I could take a ruffing finesse against the ace later.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, turned out my weak 2 backfired on this hand, six is a pretty good contract. My hand does meet the rule of 20, so I could open 1@S. Additionally, in terms of of Bergen Points, it has 9 HCP + 4 length points + 2 quality suits = 15 starting Points. Therefore, opening 1 has lots of merit.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason I opened two was I felt there was going to be lots of bidding going on, as both sides could be distributional, so I wanted to get across my few HCP and six spades right away. I am not sure we get to six anyway. Let's see. I think if I opened 1S, lisa would bid 2 diamonds, and jana would splinter in clubs. That certainly does not make my hand look good, so I just bid 4S anyway. |
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, if you count Bergen Points, jana has 14 HCP + 3 for singleton club is 17, so we are just short of slam points. And, in fact, if clubs behave not so well, we don't make six, but it is a pretty good contract. Finally, the consensus of the kibs is I am too strong for 2S, and I bow to the majority.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That hand cannot be made. however, the bidding needs to be discussed. Again, john should not overcall a 4 card suit. And due to my competitive guidelines, jana, with her singleton heart, should bid 3@S. If John had a fifth spade, 3@S probably would make. Because that would eliminate both a spade loser and a minor suit loser.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, although it worked out that pass by jana was best, that was only because john did not have what he promised. If he had that fifth spade, then 3@S would be the place to play.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very good playing lisa. Your plan was good. Well, there are a few minor improvements to the play, but the basic plan was good, But, first a couple of comments on the bidding. I see lisa went with majority opinion from a few hands ago, and opened her hand. It was rule of 20, even if only 10 HCP. The bids through 4C were normal.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Hard to say as to whether jana should bid 4H. Her 4th heart is good, but her king of spades does not look like a good card. It turns out it is a good card, but more often than not it will not fit well with partner. But her singleton diamond is also good. The reason for her to bid 4H is to suggest to pard to bid 5 with a suitable hand. And, john, with 7 hearts and a singleton spade, should definitely consider it very strongly,since they likely have at least an 11 card fit.|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, because the heart finesse works, 5H does make. They take 9 hearts, 2 spades, and a club, although they lose 2 aces first. On the other hand, I might start by leading the ace of diamonds, and then shifting to my singleton club in which case 5H is down 1, but still better than us making 4S. This hand again, shows that on distributional hands, both sides can take lots of tricks if they have a fit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|OK, a few small points on this hand. First, the question is if I should bid 2S since darlene did not jump shift, the chances of game are remote. However, if darlene has 16 or 17 with good diamonds and spades, we might still have game. So, I think I can barely eke out a 2S bid, although pass would be ok as well. BTW darlene, you don't really have an opening hand by the rule of 20. You should not open which is one reason why 2S was such a difficult contract.|
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next, I should have made darlene come up with a plan before starting, although this hand is hard to plan. There are one club loser, 2 spade losers at least and possibly 2 diamond losers, kind of a mess. So, if lucky, can make 2. Now, you need to figure out how to come to 8 tricks.|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You have 3 aces outside the trump suit. So one possibility is to come up with 5 trump tricks. This can happen if you can ruff 2 clubs in dummy, 2 hearts in your hand, and score the K of spades if jana has the A. |
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another possibility, which you tried is the heart finesse. So, my play would be to win a club and play a low club. Perhaps they will lead trump and help you out. If not, you can try my alternate plan of cross ruffing clubs and hearts.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Well that is kind of the right idea but let me suggest an alternative. Lets count winners. You have 2 spades and a heart. That's 3 tricks. If you can ruff one spade in dummy (likely that spades are 4-3 on this auction), that's 4 tricks. If you can then score 4 trumps in your hand, that's 8 tricks. So, how about ace of hearts, 2 spades, ruff a spade, ruff a heart, and play a spade. If you can manage to score your 6 and 9 of clubs, you will take 8 tricks that way.|

The key to planning is to look at all the suits, and count  your winners, and figure out a way to come to the appropriate number of tricks. This hand was somewhat hard, but not all that hard. Once you figure out you have 3 outside winners, you have to figure out the best way to take 5 trump tricks.|

My search simply repeated what I have read many times in the past:|

Once you make a Two or Three-Bid, you've described your  hand.  You should not bid again unless partner makes a forcing bid. Partner can force by bidding a new suit, cue bidding the opponent's suit, bidding 2NT (Ogust or asking for feature), or by asking for aces. |cp||

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, what may have confused you is that, over weak 2s, my style is to play new suits by responder as non-forcing. 2N is the only forcing bid the way I play it.

@d@d I have no clue what would be the best bid after 4@C. But, I probably would have bid 4@S as there is not such a thing as 3 and 1/2@S. So I changed my bid to 4@S as the final auction and repeated the deal for a double dummy play. I am interested to hear your reaction. I am sure it would be based before looking at the North hand. |
