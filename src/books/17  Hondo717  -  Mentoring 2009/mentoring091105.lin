at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, lets do the auction first. I would open 2S with duffer's hand, but very few others would, so pass is fine. 1C and 1D are fine. The problem with 2S is duffer's hand is a bit strong to bid it and her points are outside the spade suit. A weak jump shift is typically around 3 points. We might have game if I have 4 spades and a 20 count or so. Bidding 2S precludes us from finding it. Now, granted the 1D bid makes your Q of diamonds less valuable.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| My choice would be 1S. If you count your Starting Points you have 5 HCP + 2 length points = 7. Even if you deduct 1 for the Q of diamonds, you still have 6. Then, roberta should bid 3D over 2S. It is very clear. Remember the law of total tricks. Always follow it. You have 9 card fit, so bid at the 3 level. In fact, roberta is closer to a 3C limit raise than a pass, but I think 3D is just right. If roberta bids 3D then I bid 3S, which is what we should make.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play. the reason roberta should play 2nd hand low is that she should assume that if duffer had the Ace of spades, she would take the finesse. You need to think about this type of issue when deciding how to defend. If duffer being tricky and leading low from Ace, then publicly say "congratulations" and privately think North made a mistake and got away with it.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand is a great illustration of why 2 over 1 is better than SAYC. Once duffer opens 1 spade, roberta loves her hand. Let's count roberta's Bergen Points after 1S. She has 12 HCP, two length, one quality suit, minus one for Qx for a total of 14 Starting Points. After, one spade bid, she can count 16 Dummy Points by adding two for the two doubletons. Therefore, if pard has 16+, slam is possible.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Unfortunately, in SAYC 2H is not a game force. Therefore, playing SAYC over 3D, roberta has to bid 4S to make sure they get to game. In 2 over 1, roberta can bid 3S, which is a slam try. With a weakish game forcing hand, she would bid 4S. So basically, it is much more difficult to bid slams using SAYC when both partners have 17ish point hands. In this particular hand, slam is so-so. There is a club loser for sure. And even if spades break 3-2, it is hard to come to 12 tricks. |
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The best bet (for slam) is to try and set up hearts, which requires 3-3 break. So, game is best. Assuming spades break, duffer can count five spades, one club after the lead, and three diamonds and one heart with a club ruff, gets to 11. But with bad spade break, back down to 10.  Now, because the Jack of diamonds is third, duffer can make 11 tricks. So after the first trick, I think the best line of play is win club, ruff club, draw trumps, and lose a spade. There is no reason to lose a heart.|

chemist011: Is the short suit game force an alertable bid?|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There was no game try on this hand. But if you play for example, 1S-2S-3C denies club cards, that is alertable. If you play it shows club cards, but may be a short suit, that is not alertable. Most people play that auction shows club cards, and is asking partner to value club cards as well when deciding whether or not to bid game.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a hard hand to declare. But by paying attention to the auction was able to make it. First, let's talk a little about the auction.  2N is fine. jana has a tough decision. She does have 4 spades, but not very many points. Her king of diamonds is probably working, but does not fit well with my hand. Her J of clubs is not worth anything. So in support of spades, she has about 5 points, 4 HCP plus the doubleton. However, by the law she can bid 3S. Therefore, I think 3S is fine. A tad aggressive but fine.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Similarly, darlene knows they have a 10 card club fit and 4C is a reasonable bid. In 4C, they lose one H, a spade and  two diamonds--only down one. Further, many declarers will go down in 4S. So good bidding all around.|

The Declarer addons are two for singleton and one for 4-card suit, giving her a total of 21 Declarer Points. It is enough for game but not enough for slam, since I promised at the most nine points.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, we already discussed the bidding and the key play was to set up the Q of diamonds before spades were played. So there was only a very minor technique problem, which didn't really matter all that much on this hand. Basically, there are entry problems to dummy. |
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So after playing 2 rounds of trumps, probably the easiest way to handle the hand is to play a diamond. Then you can use dummy's 3rd trump as an entry to pitch a spade. But, the way Jana played it was ok. In general however, best to unblock early in the hand to avoid entry issues.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have a great hand, although 2S means we might have a misfit. I have 20 HCP and since pard opened 1C I will not discount K of clubs. I can add one for quality hearts plus one for length points, for a total of 22 points. Therefore, slam seems quite likely. I might just bid 6N and hope, or I could bid 3H. Let me start with 3H. 3H shows good hearts and is forcing. My hand doesn't have to be this good but it should be a virtual game force.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, cannot set hearts as trump. The problem is, not sure what the best slam is. I know 6C is the ideal spot (as I can see the four hands), but I think I will bid what I would at the table.|

After all said this is a hard hand to bid. We have to forbid darlene from preempting 2S, lol.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Quite an interesting  hand. Let's first discuss the Michaels hand. As a law of total tricks advocate, I tend to really prefer that you be at least 5/5 to bid Michaels. However, given East has such a great 4 card spade suit, I certainly think Michaels is reasonable with that hand although I might not bid it myself. And West's 2N was asking which minor. At this point, I think pam might consider 4H. She has an 8 trick hand, and if I have anything at all in diamonds, could easily be 9 or 10 tricks.|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The double of 3H is interesting. Good Match point bid, but not sure about IMPs. With five cards in both minors, I think west did very well to pull, as she knows there is a 10 card minor suit fit.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't see what else it could be. The first bid described the hand, so the double must show some defense against hearts. I am not sure how many clubs they make. let's count their tricks. Let us count them. They have seven 7 clubs and three spades for sure. So they make 4 clubs makes. 5 clubs probably does not make. Based on the bidding, I would place East with 5/5 plus 3 hearts something like AKxxx Axx - AKxxx.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First the bidding. Marty Bergen has a very good rule for deciding whether or not to open 2C. He calls it "4 and 4." Based his formula, you can open 2C if you have 4 quick tricks and 4 losers--he means real losers. Pam has 4.5 quick tricks. She has .5 spade losers, one H loser, one C, and to and one half diamonds for total of 5 losers. It is borderline, but probably not a 2C opener.|
PG| ***** 146 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had she opened 1S, they probably don't get to six. After that everything was fine except the 5N bid was not necessary as Roger said. 5N should not be bid unless you have all the key cards.|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although on this hand, 5N was not appropriate, let's assume it was, and talk about responses. 5N asks about kings. There are 2 alternatives. One is number of kings. If you play that 6C = 0, 6D = 1, 6H = 2, 6S = 3. Obviously the K of hearts does not count as a king, since that is a key card. In which case pam should bid 6H to show two kings.|
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you play specific kings, then you bid the cheapest king you have. Here Pam bids 6D which shows King of diamonds. Some people play you cannot bid a specific king above the trump suit and some do. If Pam had the king of spades and not the king of diamonds, you have to agree if it is ok for her to bid 6S. I think it should be. My preference is # of kings.|
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, Roger can count 12 tricks with a reasonable spade break. They are five hearts, one club ruff, four spades, and two diamonds. So, Roger can win the heart lead in his hand, ruff a club, play a heart, and then play spade and ruff a spade. Then finish drawing trumps and claim 12 tricks. He sort of got it right, but messed up the entries a bit. Entry planning can be very hard which is why a plan is always good at trick one.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is an interesting competitive bidding problem. On this auction, letting them play 2S is not usually a good idea. So, the question is, should I bid 3H knowing we have a nine card heart fit most likely. At my place in the auction I think not, because I am not sure that pam is passing 2S. Had I been in pass out seat, then I should compete to 3H for sure. On the other hand, with only five HCP and a singleton in Roger's 2nd suit, I didn't think 3H was warranted, as Roger would get another chance to bid.|
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think in this case, Roger might reopen with another double particularly at favorable vulnerability in which case we either play 3H or push them to 3S. I think we make 3H although not sure. It is not a of points at that point. It is just they have found a fit, so you need to push them to the three level. |
PG| ***** 166 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Basically if the auction goes 1x-p-2x-p-p you should just about always balance. Similarly if it goes 1x-p-1y-p-2y-p-p you should also just about always balance assuming you are playing against competent opponents of course who do not underbid.|

However, as I get older I become more persistent and keep writing on the sand--reviewing the material over and over. Material from Howard's mentoring sessions (current and past) are my gold mine. I have been collecting them since June 2007. 

Next, is another "sand writing" which to the dismay of my partners I forget soon after learning it. This is from Howard's special session from October 1,  2007. I only bring you a small part of it. However, I recommend you down load and study the entire lesson. From Howard's web site ^*Hwww.hondobridge.com/^*N, at the bottom of the page click "All 2007 Mentoring Sessions."

mb|p|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Terry chose not to open his hand. I think that is a mistake. He has 12 HCP and two 4-card majors. You may miss game if you don’t open that hand. I think just follow the rule of 20. Occasionally if you have 11 HCP and weak long suits, particularly minors, you can make a case for passing, but should open 12 HCP  hands. The only time not to open a hand with 12HCP is if it is 4-3-3-3, as that does not meet the rule of 20.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, Anne should think about 3NT. I know that is difficult with a void, but terry bid the suit, so she knows there are some stoppers. Typically, it is easier to make 3NT than 5 of a minor. In this case either makes, so we ended up ok.|sb|s|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Why did you lead the 8@S Sarah?  J@S is definitely wrong. Problem with 8 is it is not top of nothing, but I might think it is. For now  we accept your lead. Unless you play 2nd high from 3 small, the 8 is confusing.  So if you decide to lead spades, I think the 4 is best  It shows both count and an honor. Granted the J is kind of a crummy honor, but it is an honor.  And on this auction, a spade lead seems reasonable, since they avoided NT.  |
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A club would have been ok, as would a trump. You lead a trump if you think you want to cut down on dummy ruffs.  In this case Terry bid hearts, then raised diamonds, so it is likely he is short in one black suit. As it turns out, it is clubs, but he has honors. You lead a trump if you want to cut down on ruffs, and don’t think you need to establish a side suit first. However, an unbid suit is usually a good lead as well.|
