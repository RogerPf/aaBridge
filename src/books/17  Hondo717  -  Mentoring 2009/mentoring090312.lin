^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over 3@C, if you are interested in slam, you begin a control bidding sequence. The 1N bidder should be interested in slam with 3 card support and/or lots of controls. On this hand, although the NT bidder only has 2 card club support (a negative), he does have 2 aces and 2 kings which are crucial towards being able to make slam. So, the NT bidder should show slam interest by making a control bid of 3@D, showing first or second round control of diamonds|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, South knows they have all the suits controlled. South has 18 Declarer Points. 10 HCP + 3 length points + 1 quality suit = 14 Starting Points. Addons  are 2 for the singleton heart, and 2 for the extra clubs. That is a  total of 18. Therefore, since  all suits are controlled and there is at least 33 points between the 2 hands, 6@C should be a reasonable contract.|

If north ends up with all the threat cards (in other words, the low cards that will provide the extra winner), then the opponents will be able to discard. So, I have to keep the diamond threat in my hand. In order to do that, I have to cash the ace of diamonds before running the clubs.|

Not saying any of you should see this, but thought it was interesting to present, since it was a real hand. Actually we did play weak NT, so the auction went 1@D-2@C-2N-3@C. The 2N promised 15-17, so the 3@C was a slam try, since we are in a game force. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My first double was negative, showing 4-4 in the majors. My 2nd double was cooperative, saying I had values. Elizabeth can pass, as she did, or bid, if she feels it would be better to bid. It cannot be pure penalty, because I have shown the majors, so I cant have that much length in diamonds. On these hands, when you have the majority of the points, often it is right to lead trumps, and if I had we would have beat it another one, for a very good result. I probably should have, as it is unlikely our tricks are going away.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very nicely played by elizabeth. First the auction. The first double is very reasonable, with 4-4 in the majors and just below an opening hand. The 2nd double is more interesting. It is usually wrong to let the opponents play at the one level when the cards are evenly divided and that is a good instinct for elizabeth to have. However, it is also unlikely we have an 8 card fit, as I might very well bid something over 1N if I had a 4 card major. So, as long as you understand that it is likely you will play in a 7 card fit, her double is fine.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, the bid I would have liked to make in response to the double is 2@D, asking elizabeth to choose her better major. 2@C by me would probably still be natural. However, since anna bid diamonds, 2@D should not be natural, since anna has diamonds for sure. However, my rule is "avoid accident prone bidding", so I decided to play it safe and pick a major myself. I did not want elizabeth to pass 2@D.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to the play, elizabeth did well to set up her tricks, and then draw trumps. There was a small error by darlene on the first trick. she played the @CK, not the @CQ. Remember, when playing 3rd hand high, if you have a sequence of cards, always play the lowest in the sequence. That is an extremely important defensive technique to remember, because were I darlene's partner, I would "know" she did not have the Q of clubs. Bbecause the defense cannot see each other's hand, proper carding is essential.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I already discussed the defense. The important thing is, by proper carding and watching the spots, you can deduce an awful lot about what declarer has in their hand. As to the bidding, it was fine. As an exercise, let us count darlene's Bergen Points over 1@S. She has 15 HCP + 1 quality club suit for 16 Starting Points. She can also count 3 points for the singleton diamond, because she has 4 card trump support. So, she has 19 bergen Points. By Bergen's methods, darlene's 3@S bid shows 17-19, so her bid was correct. In traditional the  3@S bid shows a good 15-17 or so, but remember, Bergen is doing lots of addons, so you have to up the range of what your bids mean.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think elizabeth made an excellent bid here. My 1@S bid is aggressive, particularly since I have points in their suits, but again, when in doubt better to bid than pass. My bid also gave elizabeth a problem which she solved very well. Her 2@S bid shows a strong hand, and ostensibly asks anna to bid NT with a spade stopper which anna could do. 2Nt is a better bid than  than 3@H. However, even if she does bid 2N, elizabeth can now bid 3@H, which gives anna a choice of 3N or 4@H. Both 3@H and 2NT by anna are good,however, elizabeth's 2@S bid gives you the most flexibility to find the right contract. 2@S was a very thoughtful bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I like to discuss when to high-low with a doubleton. Basically you do that when you are trying to signal count for partner, and the high low is not likely to make a difference. If, for example, I had AK of spades, and led the ace on opening lead, darlene should certainly play the J to show count. However, in trick four, the J might be an important card, and indeed it was. In general 2nd hand low is very important.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Before we continue the play, let me discuss why I led a trumps. There are some auctions where a trump lead is indicated, Typically they are where each opponent has bid another suit besides trump, and finally found a fit and you are either long or short in the opponents' other suits. This auction was one of those cases. moe bid diamonds, ira bid hearts, before they settled on spades and I was long in hearts and short in diamonds, so it looked to me like the hand might involve a cross ruff. That is why I led a trump.|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|People often lead trumps when they have nothing better to lead and sometimes that is ok. But a more important reason to lead trumps is when it sounds like there might be some ruffing going on, as on this hand. There is a danger to leading trumps, in that it can often give away a trick, by finessing partner so you need to be cautious when you lead them. Trump holdings that are especially dangerous to lead from are a singleton trump. |
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Leading a singleton trump quite often gives away a trick, so I really tend to shy away from that lead, unless I know they have a 10 card fit. Another dangerous holding is 2 or 3 to the J or Q, e.g. Qxx Jxx Jx or Qx. Leading from those tends to give away a trick. But absent those holdings, if the auction calls for a trump lead, then leading one is good. Now, we can continue with the play|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let me take a moment to discuss the philosophy behind signalling. Let me first ask pam a question. Had I not signalled that I had a club, what would you have led?|

onoway: Probably the @DK to get the last trump off the board.|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is an interesting answer. If you want to get the last trump off the board, why not lead a trump, and then you can cash your king of diamonds. |
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But I had a reason for asking the question and the reason is, a signal is informative, not a demand. So, my encouraging clubs informs pam that I have a club card. She can work out it must be the ace. However, that does not mean she is obliged to lead a club. if she feels that there is a better defense, she still should take it.  Signals are informative, but they are not demands.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us discuss the auction, as there are some interesting implications. First of all my reopening double is important. In the old days, people did not play negative doubles, so a double of 2@D by pam would have been for penalty. However, these days, everyone plays negative doubles (which is an excellent convention), so it is not possible to penalize the 2@D bid. That is, responder is no longer able to make a penatly double. Since penalty double hands come up much less frequently than negative double hands, that is usually not a big deal.|
PG| ***** 162 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, it does make it hard for responder to bid when they have the same suit as the overcaller. Therefore, opener must be aware of the possibility that responder may pass with a pretty good hand and the overcaller's suit and responder would really have liked to make a penalty double. So, if opener is short in the overcaller's suit, he should strain to double, in case responder wants to pass and that is what I did in this case.|
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|pam should think seriously about passing. They are vulnerable. down 1 is probably a pretty good score. and down 2 is a great score. It turns out they are down 2. losing 3 spades, 2 diamonds, 1 heart and 1 club. My wife ava, who loves to penalize part scores, would have passed in a flash with pam's hand, lol. I am not sure I would. it is close. The other issue is now when pam bids 2N, I think she has a weakish hand with diamonds because if she had 10 or 11 points with diamonds, she should probably bid 2N over 2@D and that is why I passed her 2N bid.|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, pam, by failing to bid 2N the first time, and then bidding 2N the second time, you showed a weaker hand than what you had. Pam should have bid 2NT the first round or passed the penalty double, one of the two. We should either be in 3N or 2D doubled. But the important point here is to remember as opener, when there is an overcall, and you are short in the overcaller's suit, you should strain to reopen with a double, in case partner has a penalty pass.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That was a hard hand to play pam. You might be able to do a trick better, but I think that's it.  pam can either bid 2@D or 2@C as a rebid. 2@D should normally be done with a six card suit when possible, but because her 5 card suit is so good, 2@D is a good choice. Unfortunately, I have a singleton diamond, so 2@C would have worked out better, but more often than not, 2@D will work out fine.|
PG| ***** 185 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play the only thing pam might do differently, is draw a few trumps first, to prevent extraneous ruffs. She can count 5 tricks for sure, 2 clubs and 3 diamonds. She has to hope clubs break 3-3 for an extra trick, and diamonds break 4-3 for an extra trick. So the best she can hope for is down 1, and down 2 or 3 is more likely unfortunately.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First just a brief review of how to show a single suited hand. Responder bids 2@C to a DONT double. The Doubler bids his/her suit or pass with clubs. Typically, a DONT double should show a 6 card suit, or a good 5 card suit. It kis a bit more involved for spade suit. So darlene's suit was a bit weak to bid DONT. She was lucky I had 3 spades. Also, it turns out darlene can also just bid 2@S to show spades, so you might do that instead. Her other options for bid are pass and  2@C. I would have passed with darlene's hand. If her K of diamonds was in the club suit, then I would bid 2@C.|

^C @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.  

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N|
