hondo717:|cp||at| Very interesting hand and some very good bidding here. My 2@D bid, which is DONT  shows 2 suits, diamonds and a higher ranking, so either hearts or spades. pam and Ira play Lebensohl after interference over their NT. Without getting into all the details, Lebensohl works as follows.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2 level bids by pam are to play. So 2@S is just competing and does not promise a game going hand. 3 level bids are game forcing. So 3@S says pam has 5 spades, and is game forcing giving Ira a choice of 4S or 3N. Texas transfer is still on after interference. That is why pam bid 4@H showing spades. ally made a very thoughtful double of 4@H. In this case she knows I have another suit besides diamonds. It also has been suggested that, assuming 4@S is natural, pam would be better off just bidding 4@S as that does not give ally the opportunity to double 4@H. We can play the hand now.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not quite strong enough to bid 3@S, although some people would. And, and once I pass, ally has a good 3@H bid. Had I not been a passed hand, 3@S would be forcing by me, showing good spades and a game force. However, since I am a passed hand, it shows good spades and an invitational hand. ally is right on the border of passing or bidding 4@S. with a singleton club, she should bid 4 for sure. I would bid 4 with her hand, because both her red suits are very strong.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Based on the Bergen hand evaluation techniques, her hand is worth 17 Starting Points or 18 total points if she counts for dummy points. Ally probably is not taking too much risk by bidding 4@S. I will be going over hand evaluation in January as part of my slam bidding lessons.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


AT|

camilleln: I did not know your 3@S was invitational....I just thought you might not have any hearts and long spades.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to ally's point about me not having hearts I would tend not to bid with a void in hearts, as the hand would be a misfit. So ally really should not worry about that too much ally. And if I don't have hearts, I must have either really long spades or diamonds, as I cannot have too many clubs.  And both long spades and good diamonds make your hand better. It is just a matter of being a bit optimistic :).|

cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Well, with the 2@C bid, she can have as much as 17. and if she then bids 2@S over 2@D, Ira's hand really improves. Now back to 2NT bid by Ira.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The auction Ira chose, probably shows a doubleton honor in hearts because with 3 hearts and slam interest you probably would bid 3@H over 2@H. But, I like your choice of 4sf because that gives you a lot of flexibility. If pam bids spades, that really improves your hand. However, once she bids 2@H, now you can bid 3@H, to make a heart slam try. I think that makes the auction a little clearer for pam.|

The auction was reasonable and I led my longest suit. didn't happen to work out on this hand, but I still recommend you do it, as it works more often than not. I am not a big believer in leading the unbid major, unless it is your best unbid suit. Ira can then count 9 tricks, but he might as well try for 10, in case we don't figure out hearts is his big weakness.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I play ally's 3@D bid shows extra values, as it is a reverse . However, some people play that once responder bids 2 over 1, reverses do not apply. I like to play they still apply, because it lets you show your point count. I would guess more people than not play reverses do not show extra values, but I like to play they do. So, you need to agree with your partner whether reverses show extra values in 2 over 1, once responder bids at the 2 level.|

In nt, you should only lead from the top of an honor sequence if you have at least a 3 card sequence like KQJ or QJ10. It is also ok if you have like KQ10 or QJ9 which are almost sequences but low from KQxx.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| I had several questions about how opener makes a forcing bid. As I think many of you know, new suits by responder are always forcing. So, as long as responder keeps bidding a new suit, opener cannot pass.  The reason for that is, typically, responder is "captain" of the hand and more often than not, responder decides the final contract. Therefore, responder needs a way to keep the bidding open to determine what the best contract is. However, the same is not true of opener. A new suit by opener is not forcing.|
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| So, if you have 18+ points as opener, and partner has responded to your opening bid, opener knows that their side must be in game. Since partner is showing six, and you have 18, you have enough for game, more or less. Therefore, you must make a jump bid to show your points. Over 1@S, lisa has to jump to show her 19 points, and establish a game force. Her two choices are 3@D and 2N. Technically, she does not have the distribution for 2N, but since she has two Ax doubletons, I think 2N is a very reasonable choice. 3@D is her other choice.|
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| Now, one more thing about the auction. liza should consider a 2@C bid.  If you have a six card suit, it is often a good idea to show it. Granted, her suit is not that good. However, since your suit is not that good, I think pass is ok. On the other hand, for example, had your J of spades been in the club suit, so you had KJxxxx of clubs, then 2@C would be a very good bid. Now, we can play the hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have some comments on the bidding. Regarding lisa's question about opening 1N with her hand.  Some people play 1N as 14+-17.  They add points for length, 1 point for a 5 card suit. I am not sure, because her diamond suit lacks intermediates, that even those who play 14+ would open lisa's hand 1N. I prefer to just count HCP when deciding whether or not to open 1N. Notrump is such a nice precise bid, I hate to lose the precision. Now, as far as the rest of the auction. Had lisa opened anything but 1@D, including 1@C, I would have overcalled 1N rather than doubling for the same reason as you open 1N. |
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at|The 1N overcall gives partner a very good picture of my hand. But, since lisa opened 1@d, and I don't have a real diamond stopper, and I do have 2 four card majors, double is a better bid. liza correctly bid 1@H. In order to jump to 2@H, she needs 10 points. Technically, I should just pass 1@H, since I am pretty sure we don't have game. But, in case liza was at the top of her range, 8-9, I decided to bid 2@H. Now, as to lisa's coming in with 3@D. There is a general rule which usually works pretty well. "if they have a fit, you have a fit".|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So it was quite possible lisa had a diamond fit. However, I think it might have been better if lisa just bid 2@D over 1@H right away. This would allow partner to compete to 3@D on appropriate hands. By waiting to bid 3@D, lisa is now taking a guess as to whether or not they have a diamond fit, and her guess is at the 3 level. If she bids 2@D right away, at least her guess is at the 2 level.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, it is normally not a good idea to let them play at the 2 level. I am just saying, you could have bid 2@D right away, and then if partner still fails to raise or bid, you don't have to guess as to whether or not to bid 3@D. 
coco24: By Bidding 2 Diamonds doesn't that show she has six diamonds
hondo717: Certainly in a major it shows 6. But, in a minor, because one of a minor is so ambiguous, it could show 5. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now bid 3@C which shows a 2C opener with a solid club suit, which is what you have. If you bid just 2@C, that is a "double and correct", which shows 16+ and a good club suit. Therefore 3@C, shows 20+ and I guess technically it is not a force, but it is close.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think that is a bit aggressive, don't you? After all, anna opened. Once there is an opening bid, I won't say slam is impossible, but it is difficult. lisa did not jump to 2@S, so she has less than 10 and you have somewhat of a misfit. I would bid 3N with your hand. A bit risky but you can practically count nine tricks, 6 clubs hopefully 1S, 1D, and 1H.  3N is almost always easier than 5 of a minor. You should avoid bidding 5 of a minor unless you are sure you can't take 9 tricks in 3N due to lack of stoppers. I will give you an undo.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|OK, let us go over double and correct. The problem that needs to be solved is how you show a real strong hand after an opponent opens. It is rare that you have that strong a hand after someone else opens, but it does happen on occasion. The solution to that problem is "double and correct."  A simple overcall limits your hand to 15 or so. But, if you make a takeout double, and then "correct" partner's suit to a suit of your own, that shows a strong hand. Typically, that would show around 16-19 points and a 5 card suit.|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


nt||HT|d|at|{|ia|,1dxp1sp2c|at|}|HT|A|cp|8|AT|^L@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if the auction went as on the left, liza would be showing 16-19 points with very good clubs and that is a typical double and correct auction. It is not forcing, but responder with as little as 4 or 5 points, especially with a fit, should keep bidding. After the 1@S bid liza had an even better hand so she bid 3@C, which shows at least 20 or so. It rarely happens that you have 20 after an opener. If you think about it, that leaves very little for partner. |
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to what liza should do over 3@S, there is no clear cut answer. However, assuming the clubs are divided evenly among the other 3 hands, an 8 card club fit is quite possible and even if lisa has only 1 club, they might split 3-3. And lisa might also have a diamond card on a good day, so they might have 2 diamond stoppers. All in all, liza can be a bit optimistic and see that 9 tricks are  very possible, so 3N is a good gamble.|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, as I said before, you should tend to favor the 3N game over 5 of a minor. There are occasionally hands where you lack stoppers, and 5 of a minor makes and 3N does not. But for the most part, if you can make 5 of a minor, you can often make 3N. so avoid bidding 5 of a minor unless you are pretty sure you lack a stopper in a suit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Again very well done by all the players. The auction is the most important.  Even though ally has diamonds, the negative double is correct, so she gets her 4 card spade suit across (even though it is a very bad suit.)  And as to why I bid 2@H as opposed to 1 spade. On this particular auction, since ally showed 4 spades, there seemed little point in my bidding spades  since even if Ira has 3 (or 4 which is unlikely), we are getting a bad break. Further, I know we have a heart fit. so 2@H takes up much more bidding room than 1@S. |
PG| ***** 176 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, if you know you have a fit, you should let partner know as soon as possible. Even had ally passed, I still would probably bid 2@H rather than 1@S. Now, once pam bids 3 clubs, ally knows that pam is likely to have 5 diamonds and 4 clubs. She could be 1-4-4-4, but it is more likely she has 5 diamonds and ally is sure pam has at least 4 diamonds. That is a very important inference. If partner opens diamonds and later shows clubs, partner must have a real diamond suit. that comes up a lot.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Note to kibs. even though we are playing 12-14 opening 1N, a 1N overcall is still strong -- 15-18 HCP. The reason being, that once an opponent opens, it is much more dangerous to overcall 1N, so you need to be stronger.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|OK, first the auction, then we will discuss the opening lead and the play. I have a bit of a decision over the 1N overcall. I do have an invitational hand. However, I know that if Ira does not have 3 spades, it may be difficult for him to make even 2N with my hand  as I only have one entry or 2 at most. So, I could decide to treat my suit as a 6 card suit, and bid 3@S over 2@S. but I decided to play it straight, and bid 2N, showing an 8 or 9 count with 5 spades.|
PG| ***** 194 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to the opening lead. ally has such a good suit that I don't blame her for leading a diamond. However, there are 2 problems. First, she has no entries.  second, I have found in general that leading partner's suit works out more often than not, or does not make a difference at worst. On this hand, it was either a better lead (as it did not establish 2 diamond tricks), or did not make a difference.  I pretty much always lead my partner's suit. If nothing else, I can always blame partner for their bid.|
PG| ***** 195 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Actually, it makes for better partnership rapport. It is in the same category as my "2nd hand low" rule. It is right or makes no difference almost all the time. Sure, as with anything in bridge, occasionally it is wrong, but very rarely, so if you just always do it, you will be right much more often than not.|

^C@2nome: As added emphasis on Howard's teaching I have decided each week to collect many of his important @E@3instructions in one page under "Howard's Pearls"  which we can go over them many times. The following are my picks. I am sure you can find many more.

|FP|2|cp|8|at|
^C@2** |FP||cp||at|When partner opens 1@D and you have both 5+ clubs and a 4 card major. If you have a game forcing hand, you bid 2@C first and then your major; that sequence establishes a game force. If you have less than a game forcing hand you bid your major and ignore your clubs, because you do not have enough points to force to game by bidding 2@C and then your major
|FP|2|cp|8|at|
** |FP||cp||at|In general, leading away from tenaces can be dangerous, particularly in a suit contract. So you should avoid them on opening lead in particular against suits; that is not to say you should never lead them (for example if the opponents avoided NT and that is the only suit not bid, it is probably a safe lead), but there is more risk when you do lead them.  However, they are less dangerous in NT, as often the trick you might lose will come back later in the hand, as declarer cannot trump your low cards.
|FP|2|cp|8|at| 
** |FP||cp||at|The idea behind coded 10s and 9s (which are only used against NT contracts) is to allow partner to distinguish when you do and do not have a tenace. Let us use the coded 10 as an example. If you lead the J, that denies a higher honor, so partner knows you specifically have J10 and nothing higher. Playing coded 10s, you often lead the 10 from AJ10 or KJ10. Let us discuss your having KJ10, although AJ10 is basically the same thing. If partner has the Q, you set up lots of tricks for yourself. If partner has the Ace, you may end up taking all the tricks. If declarer has the Q, then everything works out great, because partner wins the ace and leads back the suit through declarer's Q. If dummy has the Q and it is not played, partner can duck the Ace. If declarer wins the J or K, then partner knows you led from top of nothing; if declarer does not win, partner knows you started with KJ10.
|FP|2|cp|8|at|
** |FP||cp||at|My admonishments about not underleading aces applies to opening leads, which are blind (meaning you can't see dummy and have much less information about declarer's resources). Once several tricks have been played, it can be right to lead away from aces.

^C @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.  

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N|
