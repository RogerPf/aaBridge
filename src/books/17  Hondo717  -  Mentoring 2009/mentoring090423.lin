^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since I will be focusing on declarer play starting next month, let's talk about that first. It is best if declarer takes stock at trick 1. The hand is actually pretty easy, there is 1 club loser, and 2 hearts at most. And, if the Q of hearts is onside, there is only 1 heart loser. But, declarer should be careful about planning entries, because needs to get back to the hand twice, to take heart finesses. So winning the first spade in dummy is good. Because that preserves the ace of spades. the other potential entries are the 9 of clubs and ace of diamonds.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, the basic plan is to draw trumps, and then take the heart finesse. there is no reason to ruff a spade in dummy. At trick 2 angela can simply lead a club. if ducked, another club. She will then have 2 entries to her hand (2 aces) to take the heart finesse. On this particular hand, the Q of hearts is offside, but that doesn't mean you should not take the finesse. As with many hands, planning your entries is extremely important.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to the bidding. Although I only have 12 HCP, I have a really good hand. For those who use losing trick count, it is 5 losing tricks, the equivalent of about 18 points. And if you use Bergen Starting Points, it is worth 12 HCP + 3 length points + 1 quality suit for 16. |
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| So using either LTC or Bergen points, good enough to jump to 3@C, despite the 12 HCP. And, because angela has 2 aces and 9 points, she should bid 3N which is a good contract. There are 9 tricks to be had, 6 clubs 2 spades and a diamond. Because the Q of hearts is offside, with perfect defense, 2 hearts and then diamond switch, you can go down, but in real life it will make almost all the time.|

SB|N|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|aggie's bid was exactly correct.  dianne was showing 5 diamonds and 4 hearts, and 16+ points.  aggie does not have a game force over 2@H, so her 3@D bid shows a min response with 3+ diamonds which is exactly what she has. Basically, reverses work as follows. They are forcing to at least 2N. So if responder wants to force to game, they can bid 4sf, or make a bid below 2N, and then keep bidding. If they simply bid 2N or raise one of opener's suits, that shows a weak hand, not a game force.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now as to why I did not lead back clubs. I know dianne has at least 3 club  because my partner led the 5 (should have led the 3), promising at most 5 clubs. Therefore, since dianne was at least 5-4 in the red suits, she has at most one spade. So it is pretty clear we have 4 spade tricks at least. I played the ace  because dianne might have the stiff K.  As I say, you can learn a lot about the hands if you listen to the bidding, and partner makes the correct opening lead. 

The lead here is  either the 9 of clubs (top of nothing) or the @C3 (4th best).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You played the hand well. We will discuss the declarer play in a minute, but first the bidding.  aggie should bid 2@H over 1@S.  You might be wondering why she can do that with only 3 HCP. Remember, aggie passed originally, denying six points. So, with a singleton spade, and 5 hearts, using Bergen's methods, her hand is worth 4 or 5 points. On another point, and then we end up in 2@H anyway. |
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let's look at the declarer play.  aggie can count 2 heart losers, 2 club losers and 1 diamond loser. The thing she needs to be worried about is running out of trumps prematurely. So, at trick 2 she should probably play a diamond and a diamond  or a diamond and a club. She should knock out the minor suit cards before drawing trumps. The idea being that she doesn't want to run out of trumps too early.  But other than that she played the hand well.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out they make 6 spades, if they guess diamonds, but that didn't turn out to be a good result for us, as it won't be bid. We are -800, and they are plus 680 or 650, so we lose 120-150, 4 imps or so not a disaster, but not a good result. 

I am not sure if aggie should bid 5@H or not, but let me discuss why I will bid 5@H for the following reasons. Based on the auction, I know aggie has at most 1 spade because I have 4 and they must have an 8 card fit. |
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My stiff club means we only have 1 club loser. We probably have no heart losers, so if we can limit diamonds to 2 losers, we are down 2. And, if aggie's K of clubs were the K of diamonds instead, we would be down 2. So 5@H rates to be a good sac most of the time. As I say, bidding at this point is guesses based on judgement. My judgement would be that it rates to be a good sac. Not right here, but I will be right more often than not.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played angela. Because you got a bad spade break, need to knock out the spade, and hope you get a minor suit trick. So again, planning the hand is very important. angela can count 7 tricks if spades break, so she should try those first. Once that works, if it does, she can then try for extra tricks.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very nicely done diane. First the bidding, particularly why I bid 2@H. On certain hands, it is ok if it goes one minor - p - 1 major - p for opener to raise on 3 card support, even though responder only promises 4. If you have an unbalanced hand, with 3 to an honor, it is ok to raise to 2. My hand was border line, because I did have stoppers in the outside suits, so 1N by me was fine.  I just bid 2@H mostly to show that it was another possible bid. But don't be afraid to raise on 3 card support. Often it will get you to game, whereas you might miss game with a non raise.|
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the declarer play, dianne sees at most 5 losers. No spades, 1 heart, 1 diamond, and 3 clubs. So drawing trumps right away was a good idea. And, setting up clubs was a good idea, because if they don't lead diamonds, dianne can pitch her losing diamond, as she did. However, aggie can help angela out on defense. She should discard the 9 of diamonds, not the 2. A diamond lead cannot hurt. And if angela has the king, will set up tricks. Your club lead was fine. I am talking about on the 2nd club at trick seven, you pitched the 2 of diamonds. You should pitch the 9 of diamonds, to signal angela that you have diamond cards.|

That is not quite enough to bid 3@H, as  you need 17 to jump. My 2@H bid shows 13-16 Dummy Points.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us review how to bid over an inverted raise. Assuming I was not a passed hand, there are two issues to resolve. One is, whether or not we have all suits stopped for NT. The other is, whether or not I have an opening hand. Here, because I am a passed hand, pam knows I don't have an opening hand. So because I passed originally, pam could pass. Had I not passed however, pam could not pass.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that, if you are optimistic, we might still have 3N. You have a nice diamond suit, could easily yield six tricks. So if you are an optimist, 2@S to show your spade stopper and deny a heart stopper is fine. Unfortunately, we had a bad fit, and the ace of spades was offside, so we got too high. But there are other hands I could have where 3N makes.|

^-|CP||FP||AT|^B@2^Y@3- Howard would you please briefly explain what is all about this Inverted minors?|
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Inverted minors basically "invert" the strength of 2 level and 3 level raises. If not playing inverted minor raises, a raise to 2 is weaker than a raise to 3. However, if you play inverted raises, a raise to 2 is stronger than a raise to 3. There are more details that I need to explain, but that is the essence of the convention. The justification is that with a weak hand you want to preempt the opponent as soon as possible, whereas with a stronger hand you want to retain more room to explore for the appropriate contract.|
PG| ***** 145 ***** |

- Thank you. Notwithstanding the inverted minors please explain what are the priorities responding to 1m opening. Please briefly consider a minimum, medium and a maximum hand. I learned that the first priority is to bid the four card major. Please elaborate.|
PG| ***** 146 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you make a minor raise (to either the 2 level or 3 level), you are guaranteed to have no 4 card major. That is the most important thing to remember. If you raise your partner's minor, you are giving up on finding a major suit fit.|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


at|

I make a jump raise (to the 3 level) with 5 to a bad 9 points and 5+ card suit. I might have the other minor, but feel that the jump raise is tactically the right thing to do to make it difficult for the opponents. I will tend to prefer the jump raise to a bid of 1N if I have 5 card support. |
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


AT|

I raise to 2 with 10+ points (no upper limit) and at least 4 card support.|

- You have 10+ points and a 2-3-4-4 hand and partner opens 1@c what would be your bid.|
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would bid 1@D rather than 2@C. Both are forcing, but 1@D takes up less room and gives partner more flexibility to describe his hand. However, if partner opens 1@D and I have 10+ points and 2-3-4-4 distribution, I might bid 2@D, since 2@C should show a 5 card suit. In both cases, however, I might also bid 2N (showing 11-12) or 3N (showing 13-15), if |cp|8|at|I had stoppers in the majors.|cp||
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


at|

- Let me see if I understood it correctly. You respond 2@d if you have a 15 pointer with 2-3-4-4 and your partner opens 1@d?|
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you choose to raise diamonds, you bid 2@D. However, as I mentioned previously, 2N and 3N are possible bids if you have the majors stopped.|
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


AT|

- When would you consider responding NT instead of using Inverted Minors?|
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I bid 2N, or 3N if I have a balanced hand (not necessarily 2-3-4-4, although that is a common distribution), stoppers in the majors, and the appropriate number of HCP.|
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


AT| 
- Thank you Howard. Let me shift to openers response in Inverted minors.  Would you please describe opener's priorities when partner responds at 2 level?|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Opener should now respond with his lowest stopper. If responder has less than a game forcing hand, he should continue to bid stoppers below 3 of the agreed upon suit, or 2N if he has all the other suits stopped. |
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If responder has a game forcing hand, he must make sure the partnership bids game, by either bidding 3N if all suits are stopped, or continue bidding new suits if not. Similarly, if opener has 15+, it is his responsibility to make sure the partnership reaches games, by either bidding 3N if all suits are stopped, or continuing to bid new suits if not. Once 3 suits have been bid (the original suit and 2 stopper suits), if someone bids the 4th suit, that is asking about a stopper rather than telling, because if the bidder has the remaining suit stopped, he can bid NT himself.|

^-|CP||FP||AT|^B@2^Y@3- In standard response to 1m opening the second priority is to bid NT in various levels based on strength of the hand. In general the responder ends up playing the hand in NT. How does Inverted Minors change the bidding?|
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Generally, inverted minors do not affect 2N and 3N bids by responder. Responder makes these 2 bids using the same criteria, whether or not he is playing inverted minors. Inverted minors do have a small effect on the 1N bid by responder. Not playing inverted minors, responder may occasionally raise to 2 with 4 card support, rather than bidding 1N. However, playing inverted minors, responder cannot make a weak raise to 3 unless he has 5 card support, so he is forced to bid 1N on some hands where he might have made a raise otherwise.|
PG| ***** 160 ***** |

- Now, what if there is an intervening bid such as an overcall or a double?|
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Inverted minors are off in competition (including over takeout and doubles), in the sense that a raise to 2 is less than a limit raise. A raise to 3 is still preemptive. |
PG| ***** 162 ***** |


AT|

- Please assume partner opens 1D and RHO overcalls 1S. I have a 2-3-4-4  and 10+ points. What would I bid. Further, when would I avoid a NT bid.|
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With a limit raise or better, responder cue bids over an overcall. And you |cp|8|at|avoid NT when you do not have stoppers in the overcalled suit.|cp||
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


at|
- After an intervening double, I redouble with 10+ and less than 4-card support and Jordan NT with 4+ card support in response to partner's one majors opening. How would you do that in response to one minor opening in those circumstances please.|
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The same thing applies over 1 of a minor. With 10+, you redouble with less than 4 card support, and bid 2N (Jordan) with 4+ card support. However, the other thing to keep in mind is that the modern treatment is to play 1 level responses are forcing over a takeout double. Therefore, with 10+, responder can also bid a new suit at the one level, rather than redoubling, if that is a better bid.

^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N
