at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Starting with trick 11, you kind of pulled off a squeeze there. West had to keep diamonds, so had to throw hearts, But because West threw off hearts, it is likely the J of diamonds is with West. So by cashing your clubs, you sort of "discovered" who was likely to have the J of diamonds. It was not a sure thing, but it increased your odds. Also, you got to do an advanced declarer play known as a "discovery play" and made the hand more interesting.|

UP|28|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played.  Let us discuss anne's 2H bid in the context of 2 over 1. She only has 10 HCP.  anne, would you open that hand 1H if you were in first seat? Using Bergen's Starting Point methods, it is worth 10 HCP + 3 length points, so 13 points, hence an opener. Therefore, she can feel comfortable bidding 2 over 1 game force.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let us discuss anna's 3D bid. There are several view about that. First of all, it is a reverse. I am not saying it necessarily shows a strong hand, just that it is a reverse. It is a reverse because 2S and 2N were available to anna, and she bypassed those bids to go to 3D. I prefer that a reverse, even after a 2 over 1 game force, show extra values. However, that is not universally accepted.  Some people play that once you are in a game force, reverses showing extra values do not apply. |
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you play my way, anna is not quite strong enough for a reverse. The other problem with 3D is it takes up a lot of room. She has 2 choices of bids, neither of which is perfect-- 2S or 2N. Both are sort of catch all bids. I would probably bid 2N, since she has honors in all suits, but 2S would be ok. |
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you can see, 3D gave them bidding problems. Although 4H turned out to be a reasonable contract.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


AT|
Shalimar_1: To rebid the Spades don't you need 6 cards?|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|To the question as to whether a 2S rebid by West promises six spades. If you play that a reverse by opener shows extra values, sometimes opener is forced to rebid 2S with 5 spades. However, it tends to show six, or at least 5 good spades, which is why I would choose 2N with anna's hand.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let us discuss my lead, which didn't turn out too well. The reason I led it is they avoided 3N, hence I felt there was a good chance my partner had a club card or two. I also had a likely trump trick, so I was hoping for a ruff. In general, as you know, I don't like leading unprotected aces, but due to the reasons I gave, I felt it was right here. However, as you can see, it did not work out well.  Once again proving my point that leading unprotected aces is often a bad lead :).|

PG| ***** 82 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, let us discuss that for a minute. Many people play that. In fact, I would guess that is the majority opinion these days. The problem is, because 1N not forcing over 1D, there are some invitational hands with clubs that are hard to bid. However, as on this hand, there are some game forcing hands with clubs that are hard to bid if 2C not game force. So, there are arguments both ways. I play it not as a game force, but as I said, that is a minority opinion. |

mb|p|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is usually not a good idea to bypass 3N if there is any chance that should be your contract. So, I think anna's best bid here is 3S, showing spade cards. It does not show a suit, just cards, asking about heart stopper.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, you are likely setting the hand if you take the ace of hearts, so yes, ace is good lead. You should only lead an ace when you have a real good reason. This was one of the few cases where you had a good reason. Although even on this hand it turns out the ace of hearts would not matter.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3N was the place to play, as it often is :). Let me discuss the bidding. With such a good suit, I think a better call by baker is 3C. anna's 2D bid does not necessarily show such good diamonds. It just shows an unbalanced hand not suitable for 2N nor a reverse. So 3C is probably better with such good clubs. baker was worried about slam. But once anna bids 2D, slam is not as likely, since she limited her hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|He can make one more try with 3C, or just bid 2N.  I think I would either bid 2N or 3C with baker's hand. Once he bids 3D, it is hard to get to 3N, which is clearly the place to play. On the other hand, thinking about slam had merit, it did have its risks also.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So we discussed the 2 major points. I did a DONT bid. As you can see, I did it with 5/4 in my 2 suits. If you have an opener or better, I believe you can do it even with 4/4. For a one suited hand, you should have a six card or good 5 card suit. On this hand, 2S would have been acceptable as well since my 5 card spade suit has 3 honors.|

PG| ***** 129 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over DONT, partner should pass with 3 card support, otherwise bid the next higher suit.  So, if jana had passed, and lisa had less than 3 cards in clubs, lisa would bid 2D.  I would pass if my other suit was diamonds, otherwise bid my suit. In this case I would bid spades. The way DONT works is, if you do not have 3 card support for the suit DONT bidder bids (clubs on that hand), you bid the next higher suit, which would have been diamonds.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 2nd point was, over opponents interference, I recommend systems on and "stolen bid" double, Had jana doubled 2C that would be Stayman, and all other bids the same as if I passed.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|OK, now despite darlene's 14 points, let me explain why her pass was a good idea. darlene has 4 spades, which means she knows lisa is probably short. lisa did not make a bid with short spades, so she cannot have that good a hand. Therefore, the hand sounds like a misfit, so pass was a good idea. If darlene were short in spades, particularly singleton or void, she should balance, even with not that many points. |
PG| ***** 184 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if possible, with short spades, she should double. Because with short spades, it is very possible partner has long spades, and will convert the balancing double to penalty. Further, as you know, I could have a really bad suit for my weak 2, so you have to punish me when you can :). In this case pass was good, but had lisa and darlene's hands been reversed, lisa should take a bid even with only 7 points, due to her short spades.  lisa's hand could balance, darelene's could not.|

Even discounting the K of clubs, I still have 17 or so, so enough to bid 4H  particularly since I know we have a 9 card fit. The double made it very easy for me darlene.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not true. We are not in a game forcing auction. In a game forcing auction, your statement is correct. Had you passed, and had, for example darlene bid 2H (game force), if I had bid 4H that would show a weak opener. However, on this auction, darelene's double is not a game force. She can pass had I bid 3H  if she has less than an opener. If I have a good hand, it is up to me to bid 4  hearts.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand is easy to play. Draw trumps and knock out the ace of spades, making 5. As to the bid by lisa, I would bid 2C with lisa's hand. I like to have 7 clubs to preempt to the 3 level, makes law of total tricks calculations easier. But, as you can see, the preempt was effective. And with a good six card suit, it was not that dangerous, even vulnerable. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, I like the fact that darlene thought about slam. If she had the same hand with one less club, and say, one more diamond, it would have been worth a 4N bid.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|darlene would bid 2D, I would bid 2H, darlene would bid 3H or 4H maybe. But I like 3H better  since we are in a game force. We would have ended up in either 4H or 5H, if we looked for slam. |

^B@2- nome: |cp||at|This is a teaching board focussed on bidding only. I have it here to emphasis the value of Bergen's hand evaluation technique and Jacoby 2NT convention. The correct answers are approved--trust me. Again, as usual there may be more than one  good answer. Let us begin.|
PG| ***** 251 ***** |

Let's count West's Bergen points after the Jacoby 2N - 12 HCP, 2 length, 1 quality suit, 1 for 2 doubletons, 1 for 6th trump. That is a total of 17. Therefore, over 2N, West's correct bid is 3N (15-17).|

- nome: |cp||at|I am sure you recall how to respond to Jacoby 2NT. Let us repeat them here as Bergen and Howard play it.|
PG| ***** 256 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In order of priorities the responses are:
^c Show a void or singleton if any;
^C Show a good five card suit if any. Otherwise bid:
^C Three of the major when the hand is worth 18+ Bergen Points;
^C 3NT with 15-17 Bergen Points;
^C Game with a minimum opening hand--less than 15.|
PG| ***** 257 ***** |


sk|e|lb|*bPlease choose your bid before the actual player does^^4d|MB|4d|NT|^B@2
East can now count his dummy points. He has 16 HCP, 1 length point, 1 quality suit + 2 doubletons for a total of 20. More than enough for slam. (In fact, even if West had bid 4S over 2N, East has enough to try for slam and could bid 4N over 4S.) So, East can control bid 4D, a slam try, showing a diamond control and denying a club control. |

West knows that East must have something in hearts. East is making a slam try without the A or K of clubs and with the K of spades at most. Therefore, East must have some heart points. Since West has the club control that East was obviously worried about, West can bid 4N. |MB|P|SK|E|lb|*bPlease choose your bid before the actual player does^^5d|MB|5d|NT|^B@2
East would respond 5D, which must be 3 key cards, since, again, East was making a slam try and can't possibly have zero key cards.|
PG| ***** 263 ***** |


MB|P|SK|w|lb|*bPlease choose your bid before the actual player does^^5n|MB|5N|NT|^B@2
So 6 is assured, since no key cards nor the Q of trumps is missing. West bids 5N.|MB|P|SK|E|lb|*bPlease choose your bid before the actual player does^^6d|MB|6D|MB|p|at|
East responds 6D (1 king) or 6H (the king of hearts and neither the K of clubs nor the K of diamonds).|

West will stop in 6.|MB|PPP|
