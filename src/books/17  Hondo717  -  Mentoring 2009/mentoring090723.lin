at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First let us discuss why 4S is the correct bid. To do so we need to count her Bergen Points. She has 7 HCP, 4 length points and  1 quality suit point. Then she subtracts one for the dubious singleton J for a total of 11 Starting Points. As a declarer, she can count 3 points for the 6th, 7th, and 8th spades, 2 points for the singleton, and 1 point for the 2 doubletons for a total of 17 Bergen Points. This is more than enough for a game opposite an opener.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, absent clues from the auction how should ginny play the spade suit? If spades are 2-2, then she only has 1 loser  and if spades are 3-1, and one of the honors is singleton, then she also has only 1 loser. Therefore, the best way to play the spade suit is to play the ace and hope an honor appears. If that does not work, then she has to hope spades are 2-2. However, given the auction, ginny's play was better.|

onoway: oops.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No oops, we should not be in slam. Let us discuss pam's plan after the opening lead. She can count 3 spade tricks, 4 diamonds, and a heart for sure. If she knocks out the ace of clubs, she will also get 3 club tricks. So her plan should be to finesse diamonds and knock out ace of clubs. The order does not really matter, since she has 2 dummy entries.|

gimit: Should E lead a @h even though it was bid by declarer?|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a good question. Mike Lawrence wrote a very good book on opening leads, and he would advocate leading a heart with ally's hand. If declarer has bid a major, and only promising 4, as on this auction, then sometimes it can be right to lead that major in the absence of a better lead. |
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In order to do that, you should have a 5 card suit with at least 2 of the top 6 honors, as ally does  or a 4 card suit, with 2 of the top 5 honors. Your hope is partner has at least one honor to fill in. In this case, pam has 2 stoppers  but hearts work out slightly better than spades. On the other hand, the 9 of spades is certainly a reasonable choice of leads as well, given the auction.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, andy (bassplayer), I was skeptical at first too  but it seems to work out quite a bit. So even if you don't do it, keep it in mind, and do a post mortem after the hand to see how it works out over the long run. Just another tool for your opening lead kit :).|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|hondo717: Okay, a couple of things to discuss here. First let us discuss ally's use of the forcing NT because she has a 7 card club suit, and might want to play it there, the 1N has merit. However, I think ally's best tactic is to pass, and hope I balance, she can back in with clubs later. if ginny promises not to bid anything over 2S, then ally will get to play 3C.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, it is very possible ginny will bid 3H or 3S over 1N, and then ally will really be stuck. So, basically, ginny's point questioning ally's hand strength is very valid. Given the lack of points in ally's hand, the potential for a jump by ginny, and the likely misfit, pass is probably better than 1N. On the other hand, ally's is certainly worth more with Bergen points, but the misfit should make you cautious.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play.  ally could have made it if she simply plays out diamonds and does not play her last trump. Then I ruff, for our last trick. Then she still has a club, she ruffs my heart return and claims. The basic rule is, if there is only one trump out and it is high, just leave it out, unless you have a very good reason to draw it.|

On the other hand, ally could have bid a spade splinter with a singleton spade and she did not do that. So we likely have a spade loser. therefore I will pass.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|OK, not too much to that hand. Planning was good and the point was, I should think about slam given ally's jump. However, notice I took a negative inference from her lack of a 3 spade splinter. That is, I assumed with a singleton spade, ally would bid 3S rather than 4H in which case, slam looks a lot better. That is why it is very important to make the most descriptive bid possible, and 3S is more descriptive than 4H. So, with an expert partner, I would assume the 4H bid denies a singleton spade or club, since both 3S and 4C were available as splinters.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this hand, there is a good reason for ally to pull the last high trump, unlike the previous hand because now she can run hearts. ally tells me that she I miscounted trumps on the last hand. I know, was not picking on you ally, was just giving this as an exception to the rule of leaving the high trump outstanding
camilleln: :). On a different topic, even though I have a pretty good hand, I should not consider bidding 4 spades with my singleton. I should not consider 4 spades even if I had a slightly better hand, say the AQ of clubs, not just the ace. The singleton spade is a big minus.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let us discuss ginny's excellent defense. I hope the kibs noticed ally's false card of the 8 of hearts at trick 1. That was a very good play. The reason is, ginny now has no way of knowing who has the 2 of hearts. If ally played the 2, then ginny should know that pam started with a singleton, because if she started with 85 doubleton, she would have played the 8. By playing the 8, ginny is not sure if pam started with 52 doubleton or singleton 5. However, her heart plays were good, because she wants to ruff out ally's heart winners and the heart ruff is what beat the contract.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This bidding is a repeat from a few weeks ago. First of all, a "cue bid" is a limit raise. However, in this case, the "cue bid" is implied. darlene is showing hearts and spades. 2H and 2S by me are both cue bids, showing a limit raise or better. Expert pairs might differentiate between 2H and 2S, but for now, let's treat them as equivalent. Double by me is just a 6-9 raise, perhaps with only 4 diamonds ("stolen bid" double) and 3D is a preemptive raise, 5+ diamonds and some distribution. Having said all that, I am going to choose a completely different bid, lol. This is is forcing. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Unfortunately, we were one trick short. As it was, we were close to making it. lisa can count at best, 4 diamonds, 1 spade, 2 clubs, and 1 heart. And once she loses the lead to the ace of spades, will lose 4 hearts and a spade.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, it turns out darlene had 12 tricks. But let's discuss a slightly different plan. The danger is losing 3 spades and 2 diamonds. The basic plan is to hope lisa has the Q of diamonds. If she does, darlene can count 4 diamonds, 2 hearts, 2 spades, and 2 clubs. So, at trick 2, the J of diamonds is the best play because even if darelene wins 4 clubs, she doesn't have enough tricks. But if the Q of diamonds is onside, she does, regardless of what happens in clubs.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|lisa's basic plan should be to draw trumps, and hope to lose 1 heart, 1 diamond, and 2 clubs. She should ruff the 3rd club as she did. Then draw trumps and start diamonds. Since jana is the one likely to be short in diamonds, at trick 7, she should lead a low diamonds towards the K first, in case jana has a singleton Q,J,or 10. Once the Q pops up, lisa should win the K of diamonds and lead a low diamond, planning to play the 9 if I play low. And if I play the J or 10, she wins the ace and leads a heart towards the K, planning to lead a low diamond towards her 9. That way she makes 3S.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let us discuss jana's alternative bids  and mine as well. It turns out we make 4 hearts. Although 2C was ok, I think jana is strong enough to double and correct if necessary. The double has the advantage of uncovering the heart fit, and if I bid diamonds, she can bid 3C. But, these hands are hard to judge.|
