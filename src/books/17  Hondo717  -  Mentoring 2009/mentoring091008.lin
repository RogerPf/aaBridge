at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Excellent declarer play. Let's discuss the play first.  I normally lead partner's suit, although with such good diamonds, I think a diamond lead is quite reasonable. Now let's count south's tricks:  2 diamonds, after the opening lead,  4 clubs, and 2 spades. South needs one more trick. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|She can establish a heart trick. The only fly in the ointment is if you lose the king of clubs, and a diamond comes back, she could end up losing lots of diamonds. But, as long as you duck a diamond once, and East who presumably has the ace of hearts, has 3 diamonds or less, you are fine. As East had a singleton, the diamond problem never materialized.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|marge did make one small error on defense. At trick 5 she should duck the low heart off dummy. She  established an extra heart trick for ginny by taking the ace. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


AT|
duffer66: Should I have led the jack for the opening lead?|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, from your diamond holding, the J is better. For those who know about coded 10s and 9s, the 10 is the correct lead if that is what you play. Just briefly, if you play coded 10s and 9s (in NT only) you lead 10 from a broken sequence with J10, such as KJ10 or AJ10. Ssimilarly, 9 from broken sequence with 109, e.g. A109 K109 Q109. If you have J10 or 109, you lead the top. The advantage of that if you lead the J partner knows you have nothing higher.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now to the bidding. Instead of 3N another possibility, if I want to be adventuresome is for me to pass 1H and hope partner reopens with a double. Note, a direct double by me is negative. Therefore, if I want to make a penalty double, I have to pass and hope partner reopens with a double. Anytime partner is short in overcalled suit(2 or fewer)--hearts here, they should reopen with a double.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case, 3N probably worked out best. However, the point I am trying to make is that it is important, when responder passes an overcall, for opener to try and make a reopening double with shortness in the overcalled suit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's discuss the hand as 4S. First, let's look at your winners and losers. You have 2 diamond winners, 2 club winners, 1 spade winner and 1 heart for sure. So you need 4 more tricks. With any 3-2 break, you have 3 more spade tricks, so that gives you 9 for sure. You can always rely on the club finesse but I would try hearts first. So at trick 2, I would probably play ace of hearts and a heart, just to see what happens. And since hearts are 3-3, I end up with hearts as my tenth tricks. |
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If hearts are not 3-3, there is always the club finesse. So that would be my plan. The way you played it, you should at least take the club finesse, because the way you played it you are pretty much always down. So, any chance of making is better than none.|

With 11 points 1N is definitely an underbid. 2NT here shows an invitational hand, around 11 points, asking pard to go with a good 13 or more. On the other hand, 1NT is limited to 9 or a bad 10.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now is time to discuss the play. First let's talk about trick 1. If marge wins her ace of hearts, she has 2 guaranteed heart tricks. By ducking she turned 2 heart tricks into 1 heart trick. So ace is pretty clear, since we only have 7 hearts between us, we are taking 2 or at most 3 heart tricks. Okay, assuming marge took her ace, let's count her tricks.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|She has 2H and 2S for sure and likely at least 3C, so the contract, although not 100%, is very likely to make. Her best play at trick 2 is to play a club. I would finesse right away since entries are somewhat limited to her hand. But playing the ace first, in case I have a singleton Q  is not unreasonable. Assuming she finesses it wins, and that guarantees 9 tricks. So if she wants to fool around she can lead a diamond to the J. If she does that, she will end up with more tricks. 2 hearts, 4 clubs, 2 spades, and probably 2 diamonds for 10 tricks.|

 ^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Before you move North and play this hand, let me discuss the bidding.|

AT|
duffer66: While bidding I wondered about slam?|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It was a very good thought. You do have a great hand, and 6 of a red suit is on the heart finesse. Back to the bidding.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although your diamonds are longer than your hearts, you should consider bidding 1H to make the bidding easier. As you noticed, things got a bit out of hand with ginny's preempt, and you were unable to show your 5 card heart suit.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


AT|
duffer66: I also thought about reverse by bidding Diamond first.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|^*BAs responder, you don't reverse. Only opener reverses. Responder just bids new suits to keep the bidding open.^*N However, over 3N, you might consider 4H, because that would show 6 diamonds and 5 hearts.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT|^B@2
duffer66: So if I bid one heart and then diamond you see 5 hearts?|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, unless you have a chance to bid diamonds twice. Had there been no bids, you would have gotten to bid hearts twice and I would have had a nice picture of your hand. So 1D could have worked out very well.|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


AT|
duffer66: I wondered if I bid 4 H you would see 6 D and take me there if need be.|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, I clearly would because you bid diamonds and then hearts twice. With 5/5 in the reds you would bid hearts and then diamonds twice. Here is how to bid 5/5 and 5/6 hands as responder.|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Assuming you are strong enough to bid twice, with 5/5 you bid your higher suit first, and then your lower suit twice. So with hearts and diamonds, for example, if it goes 1S-2H-2S-3D-3N-4D, that shows 5 hearts and 5 diamonds. You could theoretically have 6  hearts and 5 diamonds as well, although I might just bid 4H instead of 4D and forget about showing my 5th diamond in favor of showing my 6th heart.|
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With 5/6, the six being in the lower suit, if you bid your lower suit first, and then your higher suit twice, that is how you show 5/6. So on the auction in question, it could go 1C-P-1D-2S-P-P-3H-P-3N-P-4H. That shows 5 hearts and 6 or more diamonds. If you were 5/5 or even 6 hearts and 5 diamonds, you would bid as mentioned in the previous paragraph (hearts first), so by mentioning diamonds first (the lower suit) and then bidding hearts twice, you are guaranteeing longer diamonds, and at least 5 hearts. Now please move South.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to the play. Once ginny is nice enough not to play another spade (would not matter here), you have lots of possibilities for over tricks. Probably your best bet is to play 2 rounds of diamonds to make sure diamonds break, ending in your hand. Once they break, you can try the heart finesse, and make six. So just win the ace of clubs, and play 2 rounds of diamonds. then take the heart finesse, and wrap up six. It comes down to planning and counting, on every hand. Just takes practice.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, the bidding needs some discussion. I think darlene should open. Any hand with 12 points that is not flat is an opener as far as I am concerned. And if she does, it makes it a lot easier for us to bid. Remember, there is a real advantage into getting into the auction as early as possible, as this hand shows. Now over 2S, I have a problem. I am not quite good enough to bid 3C.|
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me talk about how to use Bergen Starting points in conjunction with the rule of 20. What you do, is you use all of the Bergen Starting point rules except length to count your "HCP" in Rule 20 equation. So, darlene has 12 HCP - 1 for the singleton Q = 11 HCP. She has 20 by adding 9 (total number of her 2 longest suits) to 11, 11 + 9 = 20, which equals an opener. But certainly pass is reasonable.|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next, let's take the auction as it went step by step. 2S is fine. I am not quite strong enough to bid 3C. not enough HCP, clubs not that great, and the ace of spades is ok, but better if in another suit.|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


AT|
analisals: Can you give the spade queen its' full value?|
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good question lisa. Remember, honors in opponents suits are not quite as good, because it is unlikely that they combine well with partner. So I have a pass, much as I hate to do so :).|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now to janna, it is important that you use the law of total tricks over a preempt. Basically, that means that if pard opens a weak 2 and you have 3 card support, you should raise ASAP, since you have 9 trumps, and the law says it is ok to bid 3. Therefore, unless you think you have game, always raise partner's weak 2 to 3 with 3 card support--pretty much as long as you have at least 6 points.|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next, what should darlene do after janna passes.  I think she has 3 choices:|
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


AT|
double is one, the flaw being she only has 3 hearts, but because she is balancing, it is acceptable. not perfect but ok;|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


AT|
a 2nd choice is 3C;|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


AT|
a third choice is 2N, which is not exactly unusual, but is the same idea. Since she is a passed hand, 2N is takeout for the minors on this auction.|
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had she not been a passed hand, then 2N is strong. So double, 3C, and 2N are all possible bids by darlene and pass is not an option, particularly with a singleton spade. Of course, had janna bid 3S, now she must pass. It turns out we make 3C, and maybe 4. |
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next, I like to discuss an important issue left over from last session when we lost the board because a BBO crash. It the response to partner's opening one of the majors.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If partner opens 1 major, and you have support, the rule is you should try and show the support immediately if possible. With 4 card support, you must raise right away  either bid 2, 3, or 2NT or the appropriate Bergen Raise if you play them. With a weak hand and 3 card support, raise right away. Do not bid spades over hearts if you have 3+H and a weak hand. However, with 3 card support and a stronger hand, you have to bid a new suit right away, but then you usually jump to show your 3 card support.|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once partner bids a new suit over your major, he/she is denying 4 card support and if partner corrects to 2 of your major as the 2nd bid, that shows exactly 2. That is a very important bidding principle. Remember, the "negative" inferences (that is what partner did not bid) are as important as the positive inferences based on what partner did bid.|
PG| ***** 123 ***** |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss my opening lead. Based on the double, I am assuming darlene has hearts. Normally, I dislike leading aces and doubletons. But in this case, since I have the ace of spades, and am hoping for a heart ruff, I led ace of hearts. But, now that I see dummy, I wish I had not led a heart. If darlene has 4, which is likely given the bidding, lisa has 1. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played. Okay, lets discuss what West should do over 3D. The best holding over a splinter is 4 small in splinter suit. 3 small is pretty good too, as is Axxx and no other honors. But in this hand the king of diamonds is a wasted card. Much better if was the king of spades for example. So, West should probably just bid 4S over 3D, as he really only has six good points, the king of diamonds is a trick, but does not fit well with partner.|
PG| ***** 172 ***** |


AT|
sshmj: That is why I did not bid 4D to show control.|
PG| ***** 173 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, that's the problem. Once you bid 3S, and ann bids 4C, you almost have to bid 4D. You cannot have it both ways. Either your hand kind of likes slam or it doesn't. You made six though it was on a finesse.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well thought out play. The hand should really be down 2, but that still is very good for us. Let us talk about how doubles over 4 level preempts are played by most good players. They are "card showing." It is rare that you get either a pure takeout or pure penalty double. So, you have to be able to double saying you have "cards"  and partner has to use their judgement as to what do. And in this case, most people would bid 5C with ally's hand.|
PG| ***** 197 ***** |


NT|^B@2
camilleln: I just learned a new bid of 4NT showing a two suited hand and double showing take out.|
PG| ***** 198 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4N is 2 suits, but double is still card showing.|
PG| ***** 199 ***** |


AT|   sharon j: Can you define "card showing."|
PG| ***** 200 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|By card showing I mean you have a better than average opening hand with kings and aces. Basically, one of the most important criteria ally should use is her spade length. The shorter she is, the more she should want to bid. It turns out they are cold for six clubs, but almost impossible to get there over my 4S preempt, which is why preempts are such good bids. But ally should definitely bid 5C. it is possible we are down in 4S and they are down in 5.|
PG| ***** 201 ***** |


NT|^B@2
camilleln: I would have bid 5C if my partner had not insisted her double was penalty! |
PG| ***** 202 ***** |


AT|
plmzaq: Of course if the vul is switched the decision is different--i.e., 5C worth 400 while 2 or 3 down vulnerable is better?|
PG| ***** 203 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Actually if the vul is switched, it is even clearer to bid 5C because it is right if we make 4S, or they make 5C. It is only wrong if we are down in 4S and they are down in 5C. Regardless, with a singleton or void, best to bid. with doubleton, best to pass. But bidding over 4 level preempts is very difficult. the best guideline is to look at your length in the opponent's suit.|
PG| ***** 204 ***** |


NT|^B@2
mitche: Howard, the point that the shorter you are the more you want to remove the X was summarized by Marshall Miles, who said "passing is forbidden without trump tricks."|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4N showing 2 suits is a good convention. Double needs to be card showing though, not necessarily great support for all 3 suits, although you should have tolerance for the unbid major.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not much to discuss on the hand other than it turned out that both ally and I were rather conservative. As I said, playing strong 1N many would open my hand 1N, although some would prefer 1H because of the very strong hearts. However, playing weak NT I don't have that option. And ally is close to a redouble, frankly I would have. She has a very nice club suit, and her stiff Q is in my suit, so that is probably a working card.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We actually ended up doing well probably, because many pairs get to 3N down 1. A few small comments on the play. First, once East shows up with the ace of diamonds, it is odds on that West has the Q of clubs, so the club finesse is probably reasonable. With a normal club break, ally is always making 2, but I see no danger in trying to make 3.|
PG| ***** 236 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other interesting aspect was ally's playing hearts at the end. Since she knows West has trumps, and she is out of hearts, there is no danger playing winners from dummy, and inducing West to ruff as a means of drawing trumps when you can over ruff is known as a "trump coup."|
PG| ***** 237 ***** |


NT|^B@2
MarDef: I don't follow the logic of why you intuit that W has the club Q just because East played the A Diamonds.|
PG| ***** 238 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because West made a takeout double, and has only shown up with 9 points thus far, and also rates to have clubs.|

However, as I get older I become more persistent and keep writing on the sand--reviewing the material over and over. Material from Howard's mentoring sessions (current and past) are my gold mine. I have been collecting them since June 2007. |

Next, is another "sand writing" which to the dismay of my partners I forget soon after learning it. This is from Howard's lesson on Competitive Bidding" on September 10, 2007. I only bring you a small part of it. However, I recommend you down load and study the entire lesson. From Howard's web site ^*Hwww.hondobridge.com/^*N, at the bottom of the page click "All 2007 Mentoring Sessions." The file is "lesson070910.lin" second from the top.  Now, please click the forward arrow to see a portion.

BTW, you know you can click the link from here and get to the original lesson. But please forgive me for my couple embarrassing spelling errors.|

^-|CS||CP||FP||
cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|First of all, let me define what I mean by a competitive auction.  A competitive auction occurs when each side has approximately the same number of points. Typically each side has somewhere between 17 and 23 HCP.  This scenario happens in a majority of the deals so it is very common. It may surprise you, but the single most important criteria for bidding in competitive auctions is the total number of trumps you have between the two hands.|
pg| ***** 244 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|The simplest way to explain this is that if you can figure out the number of trumps you have, you can safely bid the number of tricks equal to the number of trumps. For example, if you have 8 trumps between the 2 hands, you can safely bid to the 2 level.  Similarly, with 9 trumps, you can safely bid to the 3 level.  With 10 trumps, to the 4 level. BTW, this is why when Pard opens ONE of a major and you have 5 of his suit, you jump to 4 level.|
pg| ***** 245 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|This principle is based on what is known as the |
pg| ***** 246 ***** |


cp|8|at|"Law of Total Tricks"|
pg| ***** 247 ***** |


cp||at| and if you want a detailed explanation, Larry Cohen has written an excellent book about this law. Marty Bergen (yes the same guy who invented Bergen raises) has a couple of books entitled "Points Schmoints" which are particularly suited to beginners and intermediates. However,  the critical way you apply the law is how I explained it.  The more trump you have, the higher you can bid. |
pg| ***** 248 ***** |


at|

Pear: are you saying if you KNOW you have 10 trumps you can bypass all the convention and go directly to game? hondo717: Pretty much, unless you are worried about slam.|
pg| ***** 249 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Simply said, if Pard opens 1@S and you have 5 spades and less than 10 points, it is almost always right to bid 4@S.  So trump length is the main criteria.|
pg| ***** 250 ***** |


at|

Pear: So if your partner bid 1@H and you have 7 hearts you can go directly to 6@H's ?|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Now there is one other point regarding trump length.  In a competitive hand, it is almost never right to let the opponents play at the 2 level. Basically the rule applies through the 4 level for sure, after that, theoretically it still applies, but you must be more judicious.  And since 11+ card trump fits are pretty rare, I wouldn’t worry too much about it.|

daddio123: This shows the problem with any "Law".... you can't let it be a substitute for judgment.|
pg| ***** 254 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|yes david, you still must use judgment, but the law is a very good guideline. When in doubt, I find it works very well on most hands. Now let us go back to playing at the 2 level. In competitive hands, it is almost never right to let the opponents play at the 2 level.  So, if they stop at the 2 level, even if you only have an 8 card fit, you probably should usually go to the 3 level if you have to. However, once they get to the 3 level, you usually let them play it there unless you have a 9 card fit.|

onoway: Is vulnerability important here?|
pg| ***** 256 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Vulnerability is a factor, but only on very close decisions. Do not over worry about vulnerability, especially at IMPs, where you rarely get doubled in partials. Okay, a couple of other things to consider as well, but less important than the total number of trumps. |
pg| ***** 257 ***** |


at|
^C@2^Y@31) A singleton or void in the opponents trump suit is very valuable. If the opponents are at the 3 level, and you think you only have an 8 card fit, but you have a singleton in their suit, it might be right to bid 3.|
pg| ***** 258 ***** |


at|
^C@2^Y@32) Also where your points are located should be considered.  Points in your suit or suits are very valuable on offense, and should make you bid more. On the other hand, points in their suits are better for defense, and should tend to make you want to bid less.|
