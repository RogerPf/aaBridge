^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My 2D bid shows diamonds and a major. Typically I should be at least 5/4, but I hate letting the opponents play at the one level, so I was only 4/4. I would not have bid DONT with my hand in direct seat. But, in balancing seat, felt it was a good risk. As I said, this is not a good DONT bid in direct seat. However if I hand QJ10x xxx AKJx xx I might bid it in direct seat. In balancing seat, I felt it was appropriate because letting the opponents play at the one level is rarely a good result for you.|

PG| ***** 23 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Playing strict DONT, she passes with 3+ diamonds, and bids 2H otherwise, which allows me to pass if I have hearts or bid 2S with spades. So, pass was fine. 2S was not fine, as I might have hearts and not spades. However, since Dee has support for both hearts and spades, she could also have bid 2H, since 2H at worst is as good a place as 2D. And if my suit happens to be spades (as it is on this hand), we are in better shape. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, the auction bears discussion. first of all, I was so excited that I could discuss why I play 1N forcing in 4th seat, that I missed my 1S bid, lol. 1S is a better bid by me. But let's take my 1N bid, and why it needs to be forcing if you don't play Drury. It is for hands like this (assuming I don't have a spade suit), where I have a limit raise with 3 card support. I have no way of showing that hand if I don't play that either 1N is forcing by a passed hand, or else I have to play Drury, so I can show the limit raise. |
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, that is why if you play 1N is not forcing by a passed hand, you have to play Drury. I also play 1S is forcing, BTW even by a passed hand otherwise, the bidding is very difficult. Now, as to Patti's 4H bid. It was a very good bid. She was just done in by the terrible diamond break, and the Q of hearts being offside. Even though she only has 10 HCP, she has a great hand. Let's count her Bergen Points.  |
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|10 HCP + two length points + one quality suit = 13 Starting Points. Once I raise hearts, she adds two for the singleton and one for the 4+ diamond side suit, which brings her to 16. So, she has a clear 4H bid. and she is a favorite to make 4H. So, nice bid Patti, even though you went down. More often than not you will score lots of IMPs on this board. |
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One other point. Roberta should be very reluctant to lead a diamond. If diamonds were not bid, the diamond is a very good lead. However, in general, I try to avoid leading suits the opponents have bid. On this hand I would have chose a spade. Leading J from Jx is not that great either, but I think it rates to work out better on this auction.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Kib: What is Drury?|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Drury is a convention that lets a passed hand by responder show a limit raise. If you play Drury, then over ONE of a major, and you are a passed hand, then 2C shows a 3 card limit raise and 2D shows a 4 card limit raise. I don't care for it myself, but many people like Drury.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well that is reasonable if you had fewer points. But with more points, you should be more worried about us not having stoppers in some suits than about whether a 9 trick contract is safer than a 10 trick contract. Also, we might have six if you raise hearts, since I now know you have a limit raise with three card support.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand is very straight forward. I have a diamond and a club losers. So, just draw trumps, and knock out the club Ace. Let's count my tricks. I have five hearts, two clubs two spades and a diamond. If clubs break 3-3, or the 10 comes down, or the Q of spades is tripleton, I might make 5.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Notice I also played the J of clubs. that leaves some doubt in Patti's mind as to where the Q is. If I played the K of clubs, it would be clear I had the Q. The point is, when you are declarer and you have a choice of cards to play, try and play the card that is more ambiguous to the defense when possible. On the other hand, as defender, you should play the card that gives your partner the most information because it is more important that your partner knows what is going on.|

I would have then bid 2N, and she could then bid 3H, which gives me a choice of games.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, let's discuss the bidding on this hand, as I think it illustrates some good competitive principles. First of all, using the rule of 20, I would open the East hand. Second let us discuss the auction after my 2S bid. Had it gone pass-pass after my 2S bid, East has a clear balance. I would choose 3H. But double, in case there is a club fit works as well. |
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to whether Elizabeth should double or not. She is 4-4 in the unbid suits. Had she been in the pass out seat, double is clear. However, in direct seat, it is a tad aggressive. I would have preferred her having a singleton spade, or at least the Q of spades in clubs or hearts. As it is, she has only 7 working points on offense. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to whether North should bid 3S. By the LOTT no. We only have an 8 card fit, and she does not have a singleton spade. Having said that, it turns out they make 4H. However, against best defense, if Elizabeth figures out that pard has a singleton diamond, we should be down in 3S. And, in fact, because East led my suit, instead of a heart or a club, there is some reason for Elizabeth to work that out.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now that gives me a problem particularly in match points. My void in diamonds is incredibly useful and I suspect we have no spade losers, and I know we have no diamond losers. The question is can we limit our club and heart losers to 2. I think in general the answer is yes. And I am not sure they are going down in 5D. Although I would guess 1 or 2 is most likely. If I had even a singleton diamond I would have doubled. But the void screams for us to play the hand. However, down 1 for each side is a very likely result.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, this hand merits discussion of the play. First let's discuss the opening lead. In general, as you know, leading unprotected Aces is a bad idea. However, leading from Qxx also often gives away a trick, particularly, because of my double, it is known to be in the opponents suit. And a singleton trump is also generally not a good idea, as it often picks up the suit for declarer. So East has a tough lead. My choice would have probably been the Ace of diamonds, since it is likely that pard has the K. My 2nd choice would have been a spade. It did turn out the heart was very favorable for declarer.|
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's talk about how Eileen might play the hand. Once she gets a heart lead, she can ruff 2 diamonds in dummy and pitch one on the K of hearts, assuming she wins the first trick with the 10. Then it is likely she will only lose 2 clubs at worst and make the hand. |
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, I think the best line of play is to win the 10 of hearts, ruff a diamond, draw 2 rounds of trump ending in her hand, play the Ace of hearts and ruff a diamond. Then pitch her last diamond on the K of hearts. Once the Q drops, the hand is cold  because she can then play the J of hearts and pitch a club. Now she just loses 2 clubs. But this was a very tricky hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2C is a tad aggressive because of the quality of the club suit and the vulnerability. But I certainly think it has some merit.You know my philosophy "bid early bid often." However, later you will note how this bid influences the opening lead by West.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, let's see how strong my hand is. I will use both Bergen Point count, and losing trick count. I have 13 HCP plus three length points for the diamond suit plus one for the quality suit. That is 17 Starting Points which is enough for a 3D bid--17-19 Starting Points are needed using Bergen Counting.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Using losing trick count, I have one diamond, one club, three hearts, and one spade losers. That is six losers. so I have a marginal 3D bid. I am a bit worried about the singleton spade. Another alternative is for me to be aggressive and bid 3N, hoping I can take 9 tricks, but I think that is a bit too aggressive. So I bid 3D.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, Elizabeth has a difficult problem. However, 3H is not really one of her choices. 3H should show hearts, not ask about hearts. It should be asking me to bid 3N with a club stopper. Suppose you had hearts and not clubs. You would then bid 3H and I would bid 3N if I was the one with clubs. Therefore, Elizabeth's recommended bid is 3N. Sure, it is possible that they have 5 hearts off the top. It does turn out that they can beat it double dummy by taking 4 hearts and a spade. But they have to find the lead. And as you can see |
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


SK|e|at| it is very tough for East to find a heart lead from AQx.|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me clarify why Elizabeth's 3H bid shows hearts rather than asks about hearts. If we had already shown stoppers in 3 suits, then it would be an asking bid. Say the auction went, for example, 1D-1S-3C. In that case, if Elizabeth has hearts she can bid 3N, if she lacks hearts she bids 3H--asking. But, when there are 2 suits remaining, the suit bids are telling not asking. In this case, we don't know about either hearts or clubs, we have bid spades and diamonds. So, therefore, 3H by North is telling not asking.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's discuss the bidding as we go along. If you use Marty Bergen's "4 and 4" rule for 2C openers, one could argue I should open 2C. The 4 and 4 rule says you should open 2C if you have no more than 4 losers, and have 4 quick tricks. I do have 4.5 quick tricks. Now, note that Marty Bergen's "losers" are not the same as the Klinger "Losing Trick Count" that some of you use. According to Marty I have one heart loser, one spade loser, and 2.5 club losers. So, I have 4.5 losers, although optimistically I have two club losers. So, one could make a case I should open 2C.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason for 2.5 is opposite a small doubleton I could lose three club tricks. But, that is being pessimistic. Remember Bergen does not use losing trick count, he actually tries to figure out how many losers you have. Regardless, 2C is certainly possible on this hand. But, when it is close, I like to have 9 tricks to open 2C. Here, I can count five hearts two spades and one club for sure. So, I have a marginal 2C opener and chose 1H instead.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me review how DONT works. If my right hand opponent opens 1N, and I bid a suit, that shows a 2 suited hand, the suit bid and a higher suit.

^C2@C shows clubs and any of the other suits;
^C2@D shows diamonds and either hearts or spades;
^C2@H shows hearts and spades specifically.|
PG| ***** 215 ***** |


AT|
 ^B@2^Y@3If partner has 3 card support in the suit I bid he passes. If he does not have 3 card support, he bids the next higher suit. The next higher suit does not promise that suit, it only says, partner does not like the suit I bid. I then pass if the next higher suit is my second suit, otherwise I bid my suit.|
PG| ***** 216 ***** |


AT|

If I have a single suited hand, I double the 1N bid. Partner is obligated to bid 2@C, which I pass if my suit is clubs, otherwise I bid my suit. One other small wrinkle, I can bid 2@S directly with a single suited spade hand, or double. I usually prefer to bid 2@S, as that is more preemptive.|
PG| ***** 217 ***** |


AT|

Now, let me briefly discuss why I prefer DONT as opposed to CAPP, which is the other popular method of interfering over 1N. DONT lets you compete on more hand types, and keeps the bidding at a lower level with many hands.|
PG| ***** 218 ***** |


AT|

However, CAPP gives you the advantage of showing a good hand by being able to double 1N for penalties. My feeling is that you rarely want to double 1N, so I think giving that up to show a single suited hand instead is not much of a cost.|
PG| ***** 219 ***** |


AT|

For points, If vulnerable, you probably should have an opening hand, but you can even be 4/4. If you are 5/5, you can have as few as 9 points.|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N
