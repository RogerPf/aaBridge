^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| Well played. Let us discuss the short club treatment that cp plays. Some people play that if you open 1@D you have to have at least a 4 card suit. Therefore, very occasionally, with precisely 4-4-3-2 distribution, you are forced to open 1@C with a doubleton club. My personal preference is to just play better minor, because sometimes you are forced to open 1@C with 3-3 in the minors when you have much better diamonds.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But certainly short club is reasonable if you like it better. However, responder still needs to pass with less than six points, even if they are short in clubs. Some people play that responder must bid, even with zero points if he/she does not have clubs, but that is really not playable. As to the question about mini-roman, some people play that a 2@D opener shows a 3 suited hand (4-4-4-1 or 5-4-4) with 11-15 HCP. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| If you play that, then cp's hand qualifies as a 2@D opener. But as all of you know, I love weak 2s :), so I would never play mini-roman. However, some people do play it. My feeling about mini-roman is you can show the hand other ways, and weak 2 diamonds comes up a lot more.

Also, some people play Flannery 2@D, which shows 5 hearts, 4 spades, and 11-15. I usually am not this opinionated, but I think Flannery is one of the silliest conventions ever invented, lol. I really recommend against playing it.|

NT||cp|8|fp|2|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||fp||at|OK, let me discuss the play first. cp defended very nicely. After trick one, cp knows that her partner only started with one club. The Q is the only outstanding club, and if partner had it, she would have led it. And it was smart to retain the ace of clubs and not set up a club trick for dee. Had dee played the @CQ, cp would assume partner started with @C108. Next, dee made a slight error towards the end. After she ruffs the club with the J of spades, there are only 3 spades left. She should play the K to draw 2 of them, hoping they are 2-1, and then play diamonds and hearts. That way, they only score one trump trick, instead of the 2 they scored.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||cp|8|fp|2|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||fp||at|As, to the bidding everything through the negative double is fine. cp could bid 1N, to show her spade card. Normally I would like to have another spade, but 1N is reasonable. However, another bid you could make is 2@C, since you have a good 5 card suit. A rebid of 2@C does not show six, particularly in that sequence. You often rebid a 5 card minor. Suppose you have a hand that is 1-4-3-5 for example, and the auction goes 1@C-1@S.
You could rebid 1N, but that is really a lie. 2@C is better.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT||cp|8|fp|2|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||fp||at|In a major suit, a rebid at the 2 level tends to show six. But if you open 1 of a minor, you often rebid a 5 card suit. That is why I said 1N was ok, but so is 2@C. Now, let us discuss isabable's options. Even over 1N, isabable could consider bidding 2@H. because she made a negative double. 2@H shows 5+ good hearts and less than enough points to bid 2@H over 1@S (so less than 10 or so).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me explain how to play interference over 4N. A more effective way is |cp|8|at|double|cp||at| is "|cp|8|at|stolen bid|cp||at|", |cp|8|at|PASS IS MY BID IS BELOW THAT BID|cp||at|, and everything else is same as if no there was no interference. In this case pass and double are equivalent, showing a 5@C response by dee, and otherwise dee can just make the bid she would have made anyway. Other alternatives are dopi (which means "double with zero, pass with 1"),  in which case dee needs to double. The other alternative is depo, which is "double with even, pass with odd." My first preference is what I suggested, my 2nd choice is dopi, my 3rd choice is DEPO, but that is just my opinion. Anyway cp, dee has zero, you can bid now.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is a good reason to be cautious when opening 2@C with a strong diamond suit because now we are all the way up to 3@D and strong hand on the table. Not saying isabable shouldn't do it, but it does often cause problems as we cannot bid 3N, and that often is the best contract.  If isabable's suit were a major, she has a clear 2@C opener. With a minor, sometimes better to be cautious, but 2@C is ok, just awkward because of the 3@D rebid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We discussed the auction, and the issues with open 2@C when you have a minor suit, particularly diamonds. Let us discuss the play. Although she made it, I think isabable made the hand more complicated than need be. She has 1 spade loser for sure. no clubs and no diamonds (assuming a 3-2 split). Therefore the hand comes down to the heart suit
it is likely that she will lose only one heart. Basically the only time she loses two hearts is if someone started with 4 to the QJ. If hearts are 3-3, or a heart honor comes down in 2 rounds (as on this hand), she only has one heart loser. Therefore, the best line is probably to draw trump and play AK and another heart.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nicely played. Let us discuss cp's 1 diamond opener, as that is an interesting treatment. Many people play that even with 4 diamonds and 5 clubs, you open 1 diamond, because you have an easy rebid of 2 clubs. They feel that if you open 1@C, and are not strong enough to reverse to 2@D, they don't wish to bid 2@C over 1 of a major by partner. Although that is a fairly common treatment, I don't particularly care for it. Because now if partner opens 1@D and rebids 2@C, I don't know if she has 5 diamonds and 4 clubs, or 4 diamonds and 5 clubs. And with equal length in the minors and a weak hand, it is not clear whether to correct to diamonds or pass 2@C.|
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And, since I am also a law of total tricks advocate, where knowing partner's length is very important, I always open 1@C on hands with 4 diamonds and 5 clubs. Partner understands that I often rebid 2@C with a not particularly good 5 card suit. Suppose you have 4 hearts and 5 clubs, you wouldn't open 1@H, and you would have the same problem if partner bid 1@S over 1@C.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nice bid by ira. Once I open 2@D, ira bids what he thinks he can make. Very likely has 6 diamonds, 2 hearts, and a black suit trick at least. I had one question as to whether ally should overcall 2@S. I think ally is too weak to bid 2@S. If you overcall with that hand, it will be hard for partner to judge whether or not to put you in game. So I think ally's pass was correct, although in this case it helps with the lead.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|pam has an interesting dilemma. She has several choices of bids, all of which have merit. She can bid 1@S as she did, or she can bid 2@C, or  she can choose to double and correct to clubs. The problem with bidding 2@C or doubling and correcting is you might lose the spade suit. So 1@S could work out well as it did. My 3@S bid is preemptive, showing 4 spades and less than a limit raise. That makes pam's hand incredibly good. Using Bergen hand evaluation she has 15 HCP plus 1 for quality suit and 3 length points so 19 Starting Points. Additionally, once I raise spades, she adds 4 for 2 singletons, plus another point for club side suit, so 24 total Bergen Points. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I have KQ of spades and five points slam is on a finesse. If I have K of clubs or ace of diamonds as well, slam makes. But those are very specific cards, so 4@S is probably best. The point is, pam's hand is worth 24 Bergen Points, meaning with 9 Bergen Points in my hand, slam is quite possible. So, even though I bid 3@S, there was a small chance we had slam, but not worth exploring. One more comment on the bidding. I don't think west has an opening bid. even by traditional point count, does not meet the rule of 20. And using Bergens' methods, Starting Points are 11 HCP - 1 for dubious doubleton, so only 10 Bergen starting points.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, one comment on the play. It turns out spades are 2-2. Once West plays a spade honor, it turns out pam should finesse east for the other spade honor. That is known as "the law of restricted choice", and it is 75% that ally has the other spade honor. Unfortunately, on this hand, the 25% probability kicked in, but in general, missing the QJ, if you see one of them drop, you should play the other opponent for the other honor.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Before we continue let me discuss the bidding. ira has a difficult rebid. His 3 choices are 3@D, 1N (which, because they are playing weak NT, shows 15-17), and 2N. My first choice is 1N. even though he does not strictly have NT distribution, it seems to me to be the best description. His hand is pretty strong for 1N, so 2N would be optimistic, but possible, because of the six card suit. 3@D is my 3rd choice, because typically he should have better Diamonds.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is a general declarer principle which ally should have followed to make her life easier
generally speaking, when cashing a suit, you should play the honors in the shorter hand first, to avoid blocking problems. So in the first trick, ally should play the ace, to avoid blocking clubs. Similarly, on the spades, ally should play the AQ first, to avoid blocking the spades. These plays will not cost you the contract. It turns out if she does that, because of all the good breaks she makes six.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good question dee. The problem is I have no entries back to my hand, so I will never get my ace of diamonds. In match points I would finesse, because it is likely that I will take lots of heart tricks if I do finesse, but it is possible with a bad heart split I could go down.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|He is close. if he bids 4@C, I bid 4@D, control bid agreeing on clubs. That is because 4@C says ira is saying we must play in one of his 2 suits, so if I bid a suit other than hearts, he should assume it is a control bid and assume we are playing clubs. I might correct to hearts afterwards, but he should assume clubs. However, it turns out we are off 2 aces, so 3N, 5@C or 4@H are both reasonable contracts.|

CP||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3nome: Bergen's new hand evaluation is great and I adhere to it. However, it made adjustments to many of our Rules and concepts urgently necessary. Rule 20 is one. Howard has his recommendations  on adjustment to Rule 20 when Bergen's Hand evaluation is used. I am sure there are many others. I would be delighted to receive yours.

^K@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||AT|The hand on the left has 10 Starting Points. 11 HCP plus 2 length points, no quality suits, -2 dubious doubleton/singleton, -1 adjust-3.

Based on Rule 20 this hand is an opener. And I would like to discuss the implications of Bergen's method on Rule 20 opening.|HT|n|AT|^B@2^Y@3Currently, I do not have enough experience with this type of hand evaluation and the rule of 20 to give a definite recommendation. However, I will tell you my current style. I am going to try for a while determining my hand values using only the HCP, Quality suits, Bergen Adjust-3 and Dubious shortness and not length. Then if my points and the two longest suits is 20 or more, I will open. With that in mind and ignoring the length,  the last hand is only 8 Starting Points. Therefore, I would not open it using Rule 20 because 8 + 4 (Hearts) + 6 (Diamonds) = 18. However, I will open the hand hand a weak 2@D. 
 
^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I will let you know in a month or two whether or not it does work or not. For now, that means that some hands I used to open will no longer be opened. The other rule I will use is that if the Bergen starting points come to 13, I will open the hand regardless. Bergen recommends 13 starting points as a "real" opener. |
