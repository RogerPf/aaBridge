at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. On Wednesdays we meet  at BIL.  His second session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy.|CP||FP||AT| When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N

After clicking the forward arrow, you will see the bidding by the actual player. Please note that that bidding, except for Howard's of course, is not necessarily the best bid. Usually, after the auction, Howard will critique the bidding and discuss the proper play of the hand. One more point. To open a hand just click that seat. The second click opens all hands.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|let us see if I should consider slam or not. I have 14 HCP + 1 length point - 1 for dubious singleton = 14 starting points. Once ally supports spades, I can add 2 for the singleton and one for 4-card side suit, comes to 17. So if ally has 17 we have a border line slam, and it is possible she has another point for a doubleton. |
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, since I know we only have an eight card fit, I am going to forego the slam try, as we are on the border, and only if ally has a max. On the other hand, if I knew we had a nine card fit (for example, the auction went 1@C-1@S-3@S), then I would be more interested. On the other hand, slam is likely but not a great slam.|

Unless Ira puts up the 9, which, btw, is not a bad play. However, if pam has the K, it is wrong. The other trick I got is when pam led away from her king of hearts, if she leads a diamond, I end up losing a heart at the end.|

EddyHaskel: Could you discuss checkback Stayman vs NMF?|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss the merits of checkback Stayman vs new minor forcing.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First the mechanics. Both occur when partner rebids 1N or 2N and  both are used to find out about the no trump bidder's major suit holdings. In checkback, if responder bids 2C over 1N (3C over 2N), that is checkback even if the auction goes, say, 1@C-1@H-1N-2@C. You can play checkback with strong NT as well.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The responses over checkback are similar to new minor forcing. Partner bids a 4 card major if they have it. If not, they bid 3 card support for a major originally bid by responder. 2@d denies either just like regular Stayman. The difference between NMF and checkback is that opener can bid 2D with neither major. I can then play in 2@H or 2@S if partner bids 2@D. That to me is the advantage to checkback because with NMF, you have to bid 2N with neither major.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The disadvantage of checkback is, if partner opens clubs, you cant play it. I consider the advantage much more important than the disadvantage, so I prefer checkback. However, most people who play strong NT use new minor forcing.  You can bid checkback with just about any hand because you can always stop at 2 of a major if need be.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@D is the best bid I could hear.  I have 20 HCP + 1 length point and adding dummy points, 3 for the singleton (because of 4 diamonds) and all suits controlled, missing no aces, so if ally has 1 key card, six is good contract.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ira has a rule of 20 1@H bid. I have a problem over 1@H.  I am too strong to overcall or bid 1N. So double is my only call, however, I am rather worried that partner will jump in spades.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


AT|
kadu:  How could North go to 3@D on your dbl with 6pts and 5. diamonds?|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|kadu brings up a good question.  ally is a bit weak to bid 3@D. She should have 10 points. However, if you use an optimistic Bergen count, you can get there. She has 6 HCP, + 1 length point, + 1 quality suit for 8 starting points. Additionally, if she assumes a diamond fit, reasonable over a takeout double, she can add 2 for the singleton heart, and 1 for the 4 card side suit. |
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, she is correct, her hand can count to 10 or 11, enough to jump. And because she did, we got to slam. If she only bids 2@D, we probably do not get there. So optimism paid off, as it often does in bridge.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We certainly started with an interesting hand. Had pam taken the first trick, she would be down 1. Now, first, what should Ira open? With 8 diamonds, 4@D is certainly reasonable, as is 3 diamonds. However, pam's comment about Ira not furthering his own preempt is correct. Once Ira chooses to open 3@D he needs to open 3@D. If was willing to bid 4@D over the opponents bids, then he should open 4@D in the first place.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


AT|
IraCT: I was afraid we may miss game if I opened 4@D.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, preempts are risk/reward bids. The problem with the auction you chose is you took away much of the advantage of the preempt by allowing the opponents to communicate.  |
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@H by des was a good bid. Her other choice is double, but she was worried about pam bidding clubs. And 4@C was fine as well. However, pam, once Ira bids 4@D you should double. Take your plus. Ira is down at least 2. You actually have pretty good defense. singleton in partner's suit is great on defense. Plus AK of clubs (although with long clubs perhaps only one club).  

Again, these hands are very hard to judge. The only way is to just get experience playing them, and use some general principles.|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One good general principle is shortness in partner's suit is good for defense, because that makes it more likely the opponents have length. Conversely, length in partner's suit is bad for defense, because that means the opponents are short. So how much length you have in partner's suit is one strong consideration on bidding on these hands. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let us discuss ira's 2@H bid. First of all, I play that forcing. most experts do play that new suit, even by responder to overcaller is forcing. But some do not play that forcing. However, I don't see how playing that non-forcing is viable, because how does Ira show a good hand otherwise? I see no advantage to playing that non-forcing. |
PG| ***** 96 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to whether Ira should bid 2@C or 2@H. I play that a cue bid should show 4 card support. A 9 card fit is so much better than an 8 card fit, that I think that is important. Occasionally, if I am stuck for a bid, I might cue bid with 3 card support, but pard is entitled to think I have 4. One of the kibs  makes an interesting point on cue bid with 3 card support, but I really prefer 4, being a law of total tricks believer. Again, what a cue bid shows is by partnership agreement, and if you feel 3 card support is enough, that is fine.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not nearly as exciting as the first hand, but some issues to discuss. First, let me discuss my plan. If spades break 3-2, I can count 8 tricks -- 5 spades 2 hearts and a club. So, that is the first thing I test. If spades don't break 3-2, my best bet is to try the heart finesse for my 8th trick.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With spades break 3-2, and I am ensure of 8 tricks, I I might as well play diamonds to try for an extra trick. They might break 3-3, I might be able to crash 2 honors, or I might end play someone in hearts.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us discuss a good way of keeping track of the trump suit, because many people find that difficult. Some people try to keep track of how many trumps have been played in total. But I find it easier just to keep track of how many trumps the opponents have left. It is harder to keep track of 13 cards than 4 or 5 cards, which is usually what the opponents have as number of trumps. So it is easier to remember how many are out rather than how many are played. |
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, pam knows we started with 5 hearts. Ira ruffed once, so now we are down to 4. She drew one round, and we both followed so now we are down to 2. Therefore, when she was on the board, either the K and little trump are split or one hand has both of them. In either case it makes sense to play the ace first. As I said, try and keep track of what trumps are out.  And remember to deduct one from your count if an opponent ruffs a trick. Many people, including experts, forget to deduct when opponents ruff.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First let us discuss whether or not Ira should double or bid hearts. Ira certainly has more than enough to double and correct.  The only danger is, on rare occasions, such as this hand, he may never get to mention his terrific heart suit. So that is the tradeoff you have to decide when you choose to double and correct. But in general double and correct would be appropriate with ira's hand. Next, I want to commend pam on her 3@S bid. Normally, that would require 4 Spades. But she certainly can't have any better 3 card support  :)|
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let us look at why des should bid 4@S. Let us count her Bergen Declarer points. Remember, by Bergen's methods pam is showing 17-19, and you need 26 to bid game.  des has 8 HCP + 1 length point - 1 for dubious doubleton, for a total of 8 Starting Points. Her declarer addons are 1 for the 2 doubletons and 1 for the 4 card diamond side suit, for a total of 10. Since pam has at least 17, more than enough to bid game. Additionally, des knows they have a double fit (spades and diamonds), and should add extra value to her hand because of that. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First, let us look at how roberta should plan the hand out. Even if trumps break 3-1, she can count 6 spade tricks (5 in her hand plus one diamond ruff), and 3 outside aces for 9 tricks. However, if she can manage to ruff 2 diamonds, she can actually make 10 tricks. Based on the auction, it is likely I have six diamonds, and therefore ginny probably started with 1. So, at trick 2 she should simply play another diamond.|
PG| ***** 178 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let us see if roberta should bid 4. At first, I thought you should not, but one of my smart kibs pointed out that if you count your Bergen Points, you should bid 4. You have 11 HCP + 1 length point + 1 quality suit = 13 starting points. Once dee shows a limit raise, you can add 1 for the 2 doubletons and 1 for the 4 card diamond suit, for a total of 15 Declarer Points.  15 + 10 = 25. So you are right on the border. You need 26 with the addons, and dee shows 10-12.|
PG| ***** 179 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, because your outside suit is diamonds, I am not sure you should add one point for them, since I bid them. Considering that point then  you have 14, and 3@S is sufficient. And, as you can see, 4@S is a borderline contract which is makable only  but with perfect planning. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us discuss the opening lead first. The first question is, should ginny lead clubs? It turns out that is a good lead on this hand, but in general, given the auction, it is not a good lead. You should avoid leading suits that the opponents bid. On occasion, a trump lead is good, but other than that, usually leading the opponents suits is not a good idea. With ginny's hand I would have led a heart.  It works out the same as it turns out.  But hearts are more likely to work out than clubs, given the auction.|
PG| ***** 197 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The question is what to lead from 3 small. One convention is "mud", which stands for "middle, up, down." Next, let me discuss the other alternatives. Some people play straight count, in which case ginny should lead low. However, the most popular treatment these days is top of nothing, in which case ginny should lead the 10 of clubs or 7 of hearts.  I think you should pick either top of nothing, so pard knows whether or not you have an honor, or count.|
PG| ***** 198 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With mud, you often get the worst of both worlds. Partner cannot tell how many you have, and cannot always tell if you have an honor or not. So my feeling is MUD is the most ambiguous of the 3, which is why I prefer one of the other two. I have a slight preference for top of nothing, but low from 3 has merit also.|
PG| ***** 199 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A question is raised to lead @D8 in this hand.  In a suit contract, you never lead away from an ace. If ginny decides to lead diamonds, she has to lead the ace. but leading unprotected aces is generally a bad idea. If declarer has the @DK of diamonds, leading a diamond gives away a trick.  4th best, even away from an ace, is fine against NT.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We will go over the bidding in a minute, but first let us concentrate on the play. Once she gets the opening lead, roberta sees 2 spade losers, possibly a club, and possibly a diamond. However, there is also the possibility of setting up a spade trick to pitch one of the losers. A common situation is QJx in one hand, as with the spade suit here. If west has at least one spade honor, then you can set up a spade trick, and end up pitching one of your minor suit losers.|
PG| ***** 222 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, the first order of business should be for roberta to lead a spade at trick 2. If you do that, you will make the hand. It  doesn't matter which spade. Lead the 3 of spades. If west ducks, dee will win the K. you can then lead another spade eventually, which sets up a spade trick in dummy. This is a common position. it is 75% that you will take at least one spade trick while still preserving a @C entry to dummy. And, now as to the bidding.|
PG| ***** 223 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, in 2 over 1,  if you evaluate your hand as a limit raise with 3 card support, you would bid a forcing NT, followed by 3@H. However, the one exception is if I open 1@H and you have 4+ spades and a limit raise with 3 hearts.  In that case you should bid 1@S. the reason being, 1@S is still forcing, so you can still bid 3@H next time.  In SAYC, you cannot bid 1N, you have to bid a new suit and then jump to 3@H. |
