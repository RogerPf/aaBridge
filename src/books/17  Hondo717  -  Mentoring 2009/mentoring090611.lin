at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, why did I double instead of bidding 3H? Basically, if I make a negative double, and then bid hearts, I am showing a hand too weak to bid 3H directly. So a "negative double and correct" show is sort of opposite a "double and correct." Again, it shows a hand too weak to directly bid the suit that you correct to. One could argue, with my good 7 card suit, I am good enough to bid 3H, but I thought it would be instructive to show the negative double and correct.|

3C|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|pam made an interesting 3C call. 3C presumably shows clubs. She wanted to make a forcing bid.  I might very well just bid 4S with her hand, but 3C certainly has merit. Even if ally thinks she has long clubs, pam can always correct to spades. So pam told a "fib", but she had good reasoning.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to why I doubled.  I had a singleton diamond, and a spade card. so I felt there was a good chance we were beating the hand. Did not really look like a double fit hand. It was a bit risky, but I did not feel comfortable bidding 5H, and I thought they might be stealing our 4H bid. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Sometimes you have to double on the theory that if they make the contract, you are getting a bad result anyway. But I would not quarrel if someone chose to bid 5H. these things take judgement. If I did not have a singleton diamond, I might very well have bid 5H.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Note that aggie is positive I started with 1 diamond. because only the J and 10 are missing, and if I had either or both, I would have made a different lead. so the 8 must be a  singleton.|

UP|44|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We will discuss the bidding in a minute, but the planning is the most important part of the hand.  pam needs to figure out a way to make 9 tricks. Assuming she can take 5 diamonds, which is not certain, but quite possible, she can count 8 tricks for sure. Her possibilities for an extra trick are either an extra spade or forcing someone to lead towards her king of hearts. |
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Actually, ducking a spade at trick 1 was a good idea. It is possible aggie has stiff K, or ally has king. And by ducking the spade situation was clarified. so nice play pam. The other part of planning is to make sure you use your entries wisely. In this case, pam has only the ace of clubs as an outside entry to her diamonds, so she has to preserve it until diamonds are set up.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now to the bidding. We have had a few examples in the last couple of weeks where I have raised on 3 card support, as I did here. Although my 2S bid shows 4 spades more often than not, it can show good 3 card spade support if I have outside shortness. If I feel it is the best way to encourage us to get to game I will raise on 3 card support.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the rest of the acution.  pam's 3D was a game try. My 3H bid was sort of an all purpose bid. Wasn't sure if we were ending up in 3S, 3N, 4H, or 4S. So, I figured I would bid 3H and see what developed. When pam bid 3N I was happy.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One other issue. Although pam has only 11 HCP, she does have an opening hand, no matter what system you use. She has a rule of 20 opener, has 14 Bergen Starting Points, and a six loser hand. I think 2D is probably a better bid than 1S, although we still end up in 3N. The only issue that is worrisome is her heart void. so if you want to be conservative, you can bid 1S. But I think 2D is probably warranted anyway.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, nice going to hold it to down 1. In terms of planning, pam sees 1 club and 1 spade loser for sure.  1 heart loser possibly and 1 or 2 diamonds. Her best hope is that she has no heart losers, and the Q of diamonds is onside. If she is very lucky, the hand makes. So her plan was good.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|aggie, you can hope for 2C tricks, but should not be surprised if you only get one  particularly as it is likely that the opponents are bidding due to distribution. But your double was still good. On many days you will beat the hand 2  and you beat it one, so you got extra points anyway. You cannot let the opponents steal from you, so I felt your double was well considered.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to whether or not I should bid 3H, I am a little weak, but because ally passed, I was trying go make it hard for aggie. But I see she is no longer a conservative bidder, so my plan failed, lol. Way to go aggie, nice bidding.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The J is the correct lead. Diamond is fine, but the J, denying the Q and you should play the K lisa. Correct carding is extremely important on defense. This way jana knows she can lead another diamond back.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|From a sequence of 3 honors such as QJ10, J109, QJ9, or J108, you lead the top. So jana must lead the J. that way lisa knows she does not have the Q. Because with QJ jana would have led the Q, therefore the J denies the Q. Similarly, lisa must play the lowest honor she can to win the trick, in this case the king. That way jana knows lisa has the ace, because if darlene had the ace, then she would have captured the king. By playing the king, lisa gives the maximum information. She denies the Q and shows the ace.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding needs discussion. After the double, lisa should seriously consider bidding 5C over 3H. jana must have some cards. I would be more worried about missing six than not making five. As it turns out, because both spades are off side, as well as the Q of diamonds, it is down 1, but it is really a very good contract. |
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Should darlene bid 4H? She should not be worried about it going down too much. She should worry tactically about pushing them into a makeable game. She has very little defense. So, I might consider passing 4C with her hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss the bidding. I might bid 4S with my hand, but jana's 4C bid alarmed me. If she is making a slam try, I was afraid we would be down too many in 4S. However, 4S could very well be right.  As to jana's looking for slam by bidding 4C. Her spade void is fantastic. But let's count her Bergen Points.  14 HCP, 2 lenght points, 1 quality suit = 17 starting points. Then, 4 for spade void + 1 for 6th heart and one for a four card side suit = 6 declarer points, so 23 Declarer Points.|
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, lisa has at most 9, so slam is not likely. Therefore, 4H is probably best. although I can see why you got excited. If lisa has no spade points, and, say the K of clubs and the AJ of diamonds, slam has plays. so with a perfect hand, slam might make.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think the bidding deserves most of the attention on this hand.  Had I looked at my hand more carefully, I might have chosen to bid 3C. I do have a weak suit, but at this vulnerability, it is a nice aggressive call. However, most people would pass with my hand. Now, let's take the auction as it went. |
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The first two bids are fine. Then I think darlene got a little fancy on us by bidding 2H. What darlene was trying to do was reverse to show a strong hand. However, I think in this case, a 4S bid would be fine. it shows her hand pretty well, 20 points or so with diamonds and spades and no shortness. So I applaud darlene for her imagination, but recommend that you make the most straight forward bid when you can. |
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is one other question. In general with 5/5, you respond with 1 spade and rebid 2H. However, jana's hand was too weak to take a 2nd bid if, say, darlene rebid 2D. Therefore, she might consider bidding 1H. on good days partner will then bid 1S. In this case, 1H would be a reasonable alternative, given her hand is not good enough for 2 bids.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The main thing to discuss is my weak 2. By the rule of 20, I actually have a 1H opener, 10 HCP and 10 cards in the majors. Also, as you know, many experts do not open a weak 2 with an outside 4 card major. However, as most of you know, I do not agree with that theory. I think there are a number of reasons that indicate I should open a weak 2. |
PG| ***** 185 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First of all, by bergen starting points, I have 11, because 10 HCP, 2 length points, 1 quality suit, but -2 for dubious singleton and doubleton. Second, I am third seat, and since jana passed, game is unlikely, so 2H is much more descriptive  and  more preemptive.|
PG| ***** 186 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the defense. I think the AK of clubs and Q of spades was ok. However, once lisa pitches the jack, darlene probably should then play the ace of diamonds when she get in with the ace of hearts. It is unlikely that lisa has a singleton spade, because that would give me 5 spades. Your best hope for defeating the contract is to hope I have 2 diamonds, and lisa has the king. |
PG| ***** 187 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The general principle here is to try and figure out what is going on by both the bidding and play. In this particular case, you can play the ace of diamonds. if lisa plays a low diamond, then you can try the spade. The main point, however, is given that you see only 7 spades between you and dummy, it is unlikely lisa has a singleton.The general point is, if you are trying to decide if partner has a particular holding, think about what declarer needs to have in order for you to be right.|
