^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us discuss my 2@C bid. I did it to make a point. On this particular hand I have enough to double and correct, so I could double, and if dave bids diamonds correct to clubs. However, with a weaker hand, and 4 spades and longer clubs, and diamond shortness, you should just bid your clubs. Do not make a takeout double unless 
a) you can support the unbid suits or 
b) you are strong enough to double and correct. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Sometimes you have to suppress a side 4 card major in favor of a longer suit. The other bid I want to discuss is my splinter. That shows a game forcing hand, 4 card trump support, and shortness. In this case, since dave is showing 10 or more, and I have 16 starting points + 4 for the void, more than enough to force to game. Although my hand has no aces, it is awfully good. dave's bid over a takeout double is 2@H, showing a game forcing hand. His other choice would be 4@S, since he has such a good spade suit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ok, let us talk about the auction in light of my competitive guidelines. I have a choice between bidding a forcing 1N and then 3@S, limit with 3 trumps, or 2@S.  I chose 2@S, because I felt it was more preemptive, and my hand was right on the border of a limit raise. The double by lisa was quite good. The question is, should dave bid 3@S?. Using my guidelines, the answer is no. We only have an 8 card fit, and he does not have a singleton club. It turns out 3@C makes, so no harm on this hand. However, had lisa chosen to save her 4th diamond at trick 9, it does go down 2. The competitive guidelines did work out, because you would be down 2 against expert defense. In match points, it is a more difficult decision, because -100 is better than -110.|

cp|8|fp|2|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||fp||at|Let me discuss the defense first because rick and dee did well and then unfortunately dropped the ball. Drawing the trumps to get rid of diamond ruffs was a good idea. And dee giving rick his club ruff was also very good. But since they went to all the trouble of removing trumps from dummy, they should then cash their diamonds. This sort of issue comes up a lot in defense. If declarer has set up a suit where there are many pitches (clubs in this case), it is imperative the defense take their tricks.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT||cp|8|fp|2|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||fp||at|So, once rick ruffs the club he should cash the ace of diamonds and see what partner signals. dee wasn't sure you were out, and didn't want to give roberta a cheap trick. It doesn't hurt to cash the ace of diamonds. if dee gives you a low diamond, then you can play a spade. It was good that you saw dee's return. But since you have the ace of diamonds, you can give yourself the most chances to beat the contract. However, in general, the spade return was indicated by dee's 10 of clubs play.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||cp|8|fp|2|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||fp||at|Now, regarding the question about weak 2 restrictions. As most of you know, weak 2s are among my favorite bids. I use any excuse to bid them. I have no restrictions other than a six card suit and 5-10 HCP. Your six card suit can be weak, and you can have an outside 4 card major. I always have  a six card suit. Many teachers put more restrictions on weak 2s, and if you prefer that style, that is fine. But I have been successful opening weak 2s with my style|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT||cp|8|fp|2|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||fp||at|Now, the other issue is should east bid over the weak 2. It is optional. He has a good hand, but 3 hearts to the ace is a minus. and his diamond suit is pretty good, but only 5 cards. So pass in direct seat is acceptable. However, were he in balancing seat, he definitely should bid 3@D. And turns out you 3 or 4 or maybe even 5D diamonds makes.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|OK first the bidding. I don't like to stretch my responses, particularly when I am short in partner's suit, as that tends to often be a misfit. So, I would pass with rick's hand. I think in the long run pass is better. You should tend to be more conservative when you sense a possible misfit. However, to rick's credit, once he bids 1@S, he is forced to bid game. So his 3@S and 5@D bids are reasonable, given his 1@S response. Once you make a bid that is a slight lie, you have to stick with it. dee forced to game, so rick correctly bid it. Masterminding hands is not a good idea, and also not good for partnership rapport. |
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One slight technique issue with dee's play of the hand as well. The appropriate way to play hearts is to cash one heart and then ruff a heart. That way, you minimize the chances of an overruff. dee was lucky that roberta could not overruff dummy. Basically, dee is playing for a 4-3 break, and ruffing early will establish the suit. roberta started with 3 hearts, so if you ruff the 2nd round in dummy, there is little chance of an overruff. There in no downside to ruffing early.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One heart is certainly reasonable as it shows the 5 card heart suit. In general, if you can show a 5 card major that is a good thing  and in fact that is the bid I would choose. However, some people would choose a takeout double, and if partner bids clubs they would just claim they mixed up a spade in their clubs, lol. If rick were 4-4-3-2, with opening points, then I would make a takeout double, and hope partner chooses a major. But with 5 hearts, one heart works out better more often. The only time it does not is on a hand such as this, where pard has 2 hearts and 4 spades. If pard has 5 spades, and/or 3 hearts, then it works out fine. In general, showing a 5 card major as an overcall is a good thing.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let us look at dee's rebid. 2@D is ok, but I think dee should consider a reopening double. Her diamond suit is mediocre, and she does have support for the unbid suits. It is quite possible I have a hand where I had no good bid over 1@H, so reopening was fine. But I think double is slightly better than 2@D.  A reopening double does not guarantee a 4 card major. In fact, because I did not make a negative double, it is unlikely I have spades. dee has to protect in case I had no good bid over 1@H.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good example of my slam lessons. Now, let us review the auction in its entirety. The first two bids are pretty clear. Now, the question is, does dee have a reverse or not.  I think she has a clear reverse and her 3 spades makes her hand even more powerful. 2@H is absolutely the best bid. If playing Bergen hand evaluation, it shows 17+ Starting Points. |
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A reverse is defined as voluntarily going past your suit at the 2 level. As dee bypassed 2@D, 2@H is a reverse. According to Bergen you have 19 Starting Points,  16 HCP + 2 length points + 1 quality suit. Now, I clearly have a game force, possible slam, just not sure if NT, clubs, or spades. Therefore, 3@C stands out. Once you bid 3@S, I know it is in spades. Because I have lots of Bergen Points. 17 HCP + 2 length + 1 quality suit for starting points. Then, addons are 1 for sixth trump, 1 for 4+ clubs, and 2 for singleton, so 24 total Bergen Points.|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, If we have all the controls, would bid a grand slam. Since I have all suits controlled once dee bids 3@S, I can just bid 4N. As we said before, her 6@C bid shows one or three key cards and a void in clubs. The advantage of her response is it shows the void. The disadvantage is it removes the Q ask in case I need it. So you need to be cautious about showing the void.|
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


NT|^B@2
mausie(noi): 24 + 19 = 43 hcp? Is that possible?|
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|To answer noi's question, it is not Raw HCP. Bergen hand Evaluation allows you to bid slam with fewer HCP, because it takes into account length, shortness, and suit quality. Therefore, many hands add up to way more points than just the high cards.|
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


NT|^B@2
kyno40: So where is the line to show void or be prepared for q asking please ? Specially when you do not have the trump ace ?|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good question. It is a matter of judgement as to whether or not to show the void. Basically you should as whether the void is useful or not. In this case, dee felt it was useful to show me the club void, and indeed if I did not have the ace of clubs, but had the ace of spades, we probably can make 7@S.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The redouble shows 10 points, and no more than 3 spades. With a limit raise or better and 4 spades, would bid Jordan 2N.  So the redouble denies 4 spades, but could have 3 spades. Further, to answer one of kibitzers it is not a support redouble. It simply shows 10 points. You will find out later if I have spades. I could even theoretically be void.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, with more than a limit raise I would bid 4@S  as you can pass 3@S. In fact, it is possible I only have 2 good spades, since you promised six by your last bid. Since I am limited to 12 points or so, slam is not really possible and you should have bid 4@S. So I will do it for you.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us review how responder bids after a takeout double. With 10 or more points, generally there are two choices:|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


AT|
- either 2N (known as Jordan 2N), to show a limit raise or better with 4 card support, or 
- redouble.|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people play you can bid Jordan 2N over a major with 3 card support, but I like it to show 4 card support. There is a big difference between an 8 and 9 card fit, worth at least half a trick on average.  So I like to differentiate between 8 and 9 card fits which is why I prefer the Jordan 2N guarantees 4 card support.|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A new suit by me at the 2 level denies 10 points, just shows a long suit. So 2@C, 2@D, or 2@H just shows some mediocre hand with a long suit. The modern treatment is for one level bids to be forcing, even over a takeout double. A new suits at two level are non-forcing. New suits at one level are more controversial. The modern treatment is to play them as forcing. |
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Obviously, this does not apply over 1S, since no 1 level suit bids are available. But over any other one bid, you can make a 1 level suit bid. If you play the modern way, one level bids are forcing and unlimited in strength. 1N is no longer forcing either.|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


AT|
Dianne0516: So redouble is the only forcing bid here.|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Redouble and Jordan are forcing for sure. One level bids are forcing if that is your agreement. However, you could play that one level bids are not forcing and deny 10 points. |
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is up to you and your partner. For many years, I played new suits by responder denied 10 points and that worked fine. One other small issue which I already touched upon.  rick should probably just bid 4@S, rather than make another bid, which is a slam try. Since my hand is limited, there is little possibility of slam, so no need to dilly dally, just bid what you know is to be the final contract. There is  no reason to give the opponents additional information.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, there are some interesting bidding issues here.  dee should bid 1@D not 1N.  roberta should pass 1N as she did, or else bid 2@C, as dee rates to have clubs. They have 25 HCP. However, this is a good illustration of where queens and jacks are overvalued. According to Bergen dee needs to deduct 2 points from her hand because of the six queens and jacks. So she really only has an 8 point hand, plus 1 point for the extra diamond. Much worse than it first appears, which is why 3N didn't make. |
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Again, that is good illustration of why queens and jacks by themselves are not good points to have. I have found the Bergen methods to be quite accurate, suggest you learn them from the slam book or from my site in the slam bidding section at  ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/^*N.|

HT|H|cp|5|FP||AT|
^c@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The final topic today is how to respond to Blackwood with a void. A void does not count as an ace. It just counts as a void.|
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


AT|

- if you respond 5N to 4N Blackwood, that shows 0 or 2 key cards, and a void
- if you respond six of a suit to Blackwood, that shows one or 3 Key cards, and a void in the suit you bid.|
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


AT|

However, if your void is in a suit higher than the trump suit, then just bid six of the trump suit, as you don't want to go past six.|
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


AT|

Additionally, you need to use your judgement. If your void is not useful (for example, it is in partner's suit), you should not show it. Also, if your hand is not really suitable for slam, it has lots of quacks and few controls, you should also not show your void. The reason you need to use your judgement is that if you show a void, you are committing your side to slam. So you better be pretty sure you want to be in slam.|
PG| ***** 162 ***** |


AT|

Again, it is time for a few examples.|

So, in spades, you have 2 key cards and not the Q of trumps, so 5@H is the best bid, as opposed to 5N. @S is the trump  because it was the last suit bid. The rule for deciding what suit is the key card suit is either the first suit bid and raised, or the last suit bid if nothing was raised. The 4N bidder may choose not to play in spades, but the Blackwood responder must assume spades is trumps for now.|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.  

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N|
