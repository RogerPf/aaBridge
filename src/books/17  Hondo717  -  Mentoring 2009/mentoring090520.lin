at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That made my hand get a lot better. We have a double fit. so let us count my Bergen points to see if we possibly have slam.  I have 16 HCP + 1 length point for 17 starting points. I also have 2 points for the singleton spade and 1 point for the outside diamond suit (assuming we are playing hearts) for a total of 20. So, slam is quite possible because we with roberta's 13, we total 33 points.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We already talked about the bidding. now let us talk about how to plan the hand out. BTW, nice opening lead kia. Your two choices, based on the auction were a club or a trump. The club, because it was an unbid suit. A trump, because often with a splinter, a trump lead works out well. However, on this hand, if you lead a trump roberta can make six.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let us see how roberta can plan the hand. She has a club and possibly 2 diamond losers, once a club is led. Assuming trumps are 3-2, she should simply draw trumps and play diamonds. The best way to play a 9 card fit, missing the K and Q, is to cash the ace first. That will lose one trick when there is either a singleton honor, or diamonds are 2-2. Many people try the double finesse. That is an ok line as well, although on this hand you end up losing and extra diamond. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|By the double finesse, I mean playing anna for the K or Q. so lead low diamond from the board and put up the 10. Then go back to the board, lead a low diamond and put up the 9. But, playing for 2-2 or a singleton honor is better odds.  So, with 9 card fit missing K and Q, the way roberta played it, cashing the ace first is the best. |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With ten cards missing the king the finesse is best, because playing the ace first only works with a singleton king offside, which is less frequent.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nice that you cashed the K and hoped the Q drops. Now, you should have a good count of clubs. Let me explain it the way I do it. You started with 5 and kia had one. That means roberta and I started with 7. We have played 3 rounds, roberta and I following each round, that means we played six of our seven. So, there is only one club left. The easiest way to keep track of your long suits is to keep track of how many the opponents have left, as I just did. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|anna, you made a very nice 4S bid. However, you need to plan the hand out better. You need to ruff clubs in dummy. So, after winning the A of diamonds, your next play should be a low club. It is very important that you get in the habit of planning the hand out at trick one.  Count your winners and losers and develop a plan. Here, you have 1 diamond and six trumps for seven tricks. Even if we get in with the ace of clubs and lead a spade, you will still be able to ruff two clubs in dummy. |
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That will give you 9 tricks. So, if I have the ace of clubs, or the Q of clubs drops after a couple of ruffs, you will have 10 tricks. That should be your plan.|

The other is to try and set up clubs. Both are reasonable. Had he chosen to try and set up clubs, he might save a trick or two, but if roberta had the A of diamonds, the diamond play would have worked well.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The way to set up diamonds is to play the AK first. If the Q drops, she makes 4 diamond tricks. If the Q does not drop you need not lose any diamonds, since dummy has a doubleton and you can ruff 2 diamonds. On this hand, you would make six, because you take 4 diamonds and 8 trumps.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss the play first, then the bidding. Your plan was good jana, and you played it well. I have just a couple of small suggestions. First, once everyone follows to the first round of diamonds, you can afford to overtake the Q of diamonds with the K to draw the rest of the trump. That saves you from having to waste an entry. On this hand no big deal, but on other hands could make a difference.|
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Second, an expert defender might duck the first club, so you might modify your plan slightly. Before playing trumps, you might try and knock out the ace of clubs, hoping to pitch a spade on the third club..|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|After drawing 2 rounds of trumps with the AQ. If the third club gets ruffed, you make the same nine tricks you started with, otherwise you make 10.|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the bidding. Some people play 2@C over 1@D is a game force if you play 2 over 1. I don't like that, because I feel it is not theoretically sound. When you open 1 of a major, and you have the SAYC institutional 10 or 11 point hand, you can bid the forcing 1N. But over 1@D, the forcing 1N is not available, so there is no way to show an invitational hand with clubs. Having said that, I think the standard treatment these days is to play 2@C as game force over 1N.|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If that is the case, then I would have to bid 2N with my hand  which I don't like, given my weak majors. One other minor detail as well.  I think rather than making a takeout double, lisa should bid 2@D, to show her 5/5 in the majors|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


AT|

nome: Why 2@D and not 3@C. Here, it does not matter as both Michael cue bids promiss Hearts and Spades. How would you decide which of the opponents you should cue bid as Michaels?|
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Theoretically, if the opponents have bid 2 suits and you wish to make a Michaels call, you could have some agreement as to different meanings as to which suit you choose (for example, 1@C-P-1@D-2@C could show better hearts and 1@C-P-1@D-2@D could show better spades), but I don't know anyone who plays anything fancy like that. So, the general answer is that an immediate cue bid of the opponents' suit (either one if they have bid 2 suits) is Michaels. On this hand, 2@D is cheaper than 3@C, so I suggested 2@D, but if Lisa wanted to preempt the bidding more, 3@C would also have been Michaels.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, the only question is whether or not jana should have balanced. On this hand, clearly passing was best. In general, the opponents playing in 1 of a suit will rarely be a good result for your side. You can balance with as few as 8 points. However, when you are long in the opponents suit, your partner is likely to be short. So, particularly when the opponents are in a minor suit, you should pass, as jana did, rather than balance, when you have a weakish hand and are long in trumps. As to the play, you might be able to save a trick or two, but basically it is a pretty hopeless hand for you.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to whether we should be in six or not, the answer is no. A 3-3 break is about 35%, and 35% slams should not be bid. A slam should be over 50% before you bid it. So the bidding here was correct.|
