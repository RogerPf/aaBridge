at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That wasn't so bad now, was it Lisa :). A bit on the bidding first, and then we will get to the play. Many people recommend you always bypass your diamonds to bid a major, and that is one way to play it. However, I use a somewhat different rule. If my hand is not good enough for two bids, then I would have bid 1H rather than 1D. For example, take away the Ace of clubs ( now I had 8 HCP), then I would have bid 1H not 1D.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|however, with enough points for a 2nd bid, I bid 1D and let the auction develop naturally. In this case I had 12 points, so knew we were going to game. had Lisa bid 1S over 1D, I would just bid 3N. And if she bids 1H I bid 4H. That is my rule. only bypass 1D if you don't have enough points to make a 2nd bid.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to the play. Kia made a defensive mistake there, otherwise the hand is down. He forgot to play 2nd hand low on the first heart. Honestly and truly, play 2nd hand low all the time, and you will be better off. For every trick you give up, you will gain two, I promise. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Anyway, lets look at Lisa's plan. This is a hard hand to play. On the spade lead she can count two spades, 3 hearts if hearts are 3-2, even if she loses 2 hearts, one diamond and two clubs for a total of eight tricks. So, she needs 2 more tricks. She can perhaps get an extra ruff somewhere for nine and perhaps the Q of diamonds for tenth trick. I am not sure NT is better.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, at trick 2, I would play a low diamond. If that works, then Lisa can pitch a club on the Ace of diamonds, and get rid of her club loser. She can end up ruffing 2 spades in dummy maybe and make 10 tricks that way. When that loses (such as in this case), she has to hope to pick up the hearts with only one loser. It turns out, she cannot do that against proper defense, but it is her best shot.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT|^B@2
analisals: A diamond wasn't so how do I pitch a club until I play the D Ace?  |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand you cannot. But, if kia had the K of diamonds, when you lead a diamond, say he goes up with the K then leads a spade. Then you win the ace of spades, cash the Q of diamonds, ruff a spade, and pitch a club on the ace of diamonds. |
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, you should wait to pull trumps, try diamonds first. But as I said, this was a hard hand. With proper defense, I would have gone down myself.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, first the bidding, and then my opening lead. I don't mind kia's 2S bid. According to Bergen Point count his hand is 4HCP + one for five diamonds + two for singleton making  seven points--he is a tad light, but his bid was fine. Once kia bids 2S, Darelene has 18 HCP, + 1 length + 1 quality suit + 2 for singleton + 1 for 4 clubs for a total of 23 points. That is plenty to bid 4S.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|
Now, as to my lead. I don't like any side suit lead, and a spade lead is not likely to give anything away. Since I have three to the king, I will score my king no matter what. And given the auction Lisa could easily have one spade, and should have no more than two. |
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Granted she could have Qx of Jx and my lead might give something away, but that is less likely than another suit giving away a trick. On this type of auction, declarer usually has good trumps. Everything was fine. Just unlucky I found the spade lead.|

UP|52|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, the bidding was very good.  Lisa has a classic 2S bid, and, with 4 trumps, Darlene(Darlene) has a clear 4S bid. It turns out I can beat it with a diamond lead, but there is no way for me to know that. Which does argue for Jana opening her better minor, 1D, but most would open 1C. I almost always lead partner's suit. Overall you do best that way.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the defense, when Jana gets in with the Ace of clubs, she should not lead another club back. That gives Lisa a free finesse. Probably her best play is a trump. If Lisa plays carefully, she can still make 4, but she has to ruff several clubs out first. But by leading a club, Jana makes it easy for Lisa to set up her club suit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, I led the 2, so I cannot have a doubleton. It is more likely Lisa is short than I am. On this hand, passive defense works best, once I don't lead a diamond. Let us move to the next board.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, lets first discuss why I did not bid 1N instead of 3C. It was close, and I would not quarrel with 1N. Being short in the majors and with 5 clubs, I felt 3C was better. 80% of the time when pard opens 1C they have at least  a 4 card suit. So, 80% of the time we have a 9+ card fit and 3C is more preemptive, and makes it harder for the opponents to find their major. In this case, I preempted partner, but that is not usually the case, and she was able to bid 3N anyway. |
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next to discuss is the opening lead. In general, I find 4th best works out the best against NT, unless the suit was bid by the opponents. With Lisa's hand, I would have lead a low heart. She should not lead a club, as that is our suit. It is almost never right to lead the opponents suit. Had Lisa led a heart, 3N is a bit harder, as they take 2H 1C and 1D at least. And they might get a second spade. So, I do recommend 4th best from longest and strongest in NT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That was a very hard hand to play. Let me discuss the bidding first. I probably do not have the appropriate hand for a weak jump shift. But if I bid 1S, then I will never be able to show my diamonds anyway, because if I bid 2D over 1N or 2C, that shows a stronger hand. So, I decided 2S was the best description. It worked out, but I was lucky.|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to the play. Darlene needs to count her tricks, just as my recent declarer play lesson talked about. Outside of trumps, she has 5 top tricks. If she draws 2 rounds of trump, she can count 3 trumps in her hand and 4 on the board which is 7 more tricks. If trumps are not 2-2 one of the trumps will be overruffed, but that is still 11 tricks. Playing the King of diamonds is correct.|
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Darlene started out well, she just should not bother to take the diamond finesse, as even if it wins, she only has 11 tricks. And if it loses, she might only have 10. Whereas if she just plays for a 2-2 break, she can make 12 tricks. So, the lesson here is to count your tricks, although it was a bit hard on this hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nicely played. The bidding, everything was fine. Lisa is just a smidgen weak to make a negative double. Let us assume the hands were slightly different, and the auction proceeded 1D-1S-X-P. If I bid 2H over the negative double, that is not a reverse. The reason being that a negative double by Lisa implies hearts, so I am simply "raising" hearts. So the auction 1D-1S-X-P-2H is not a reverse. If the auction went 1D-1S-1N-P-2H, that would be a reverse, because I am not raising hearts.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, Jana played it the best way she could to lose 1 spade trick. My only suggestion is that she play a 2nd diamond right away, to set up the J of diamonds for a pitch. It turns out I am stuck for a lead anyway, but if Lisa gets in, and leads a heart, Jana might lose 2H tricks. But if she plays a diamond right away, she sets up a heart pitch. That is a minor detail, her play of the hand was good.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Jana had a classic DONT one suited bid. Had Lisa had more points, we would have played systems on, so any bid she makes is as if Jana did not double. 2C being Stayman, 2D being a transfer and so forth. But obviously Lisa is too weak to say anything. And, playing DONT, you should really be disciplined and bid 2C over the double, as required by the convention even if you are sure partner is going to bid a suit where you are short.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, lots to talk about here. First of all the bidding.  2D is way too timid by dee. By the law of total tricks she has a clear 3d bid. You should really always follow the law. It almost always works out well. Of your four choices of bids, 2D, 2H, 3C (limit raise), and 3D, the 2D is my last choice.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You are closer to a limit raise than a 2D bid. You have 9 points in support of diamonds. I think 3D is best, but I think a limit raise is way better than 2D.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now as to the play and defense. Roberta needs to count her tricks. She has 1D trick after the opening lead, two Spades and one Heart for sure. That's four. In trumps, if she ruffs once in dummy she has four trump tricks--for a total of eight. She has several plays for a ninth trick. One is the K of hearts onside. The other is a 3-3 break in one of the majors. As it turned out, since we misdiscarded she ended up making the contract.|
PG| ***** 178 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My plan would be to first draw trumps, then test hearts, and test spades. Now, dee you should throw your diamonds rather than your hearts in tricks seven and eight. In general, on defense you do what is known as |CP|8|AT|"keep parity"|CP||AT| with dummy. That means if dummy has a long suit, you try and keep at least the same number of cards as dummy. In this case, since dummy has 4 hearts, you should keep 4 hearts. You can safely throw diamonds, as you know roberta has no more. |
PG| ***** 179 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You threw 2 hearts away, thereby letting roberta score her small hearts. Defense is always hard. But the keeping parity with dummy technique is a good one to remember.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The contract was a good one, it will make anytime trumps are 3-1. Less experienced players are often reluctant to make declarer ruff.  But, it is often a good line of defense, as on this hand.  It is usually a neutral defense at worst. So don’t be afraid to force declarer to ruff, if you have nothing else better, or you are trying to set up trumps in your hand.|
