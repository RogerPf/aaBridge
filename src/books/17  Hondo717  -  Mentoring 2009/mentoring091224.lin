^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Patti's overcall is a tad light, but certainly has some merit. Had she had a singleton spade and 3 small diamonds, it would have been clear cut. Now, as to Dee. She certainly has a very nice hand. However, it does have some flaws. First of all, it is rare that you can make slam after an opening bid, unless you are very distributional. Second, the KJ of spades are not pulling their full weight. So, I think a simple 4H bid is probably best. That happens to go down as well, but that is because everything is offside (not a huge surprise) and Patti is a bit light. |
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One other point about Dee's decision making. Her 2S bid had merit, if she thought there might be slam. However, once Patti bids 3H, which is the weakest bid there is, she should just bid 4H. Her thinking was not consistent. 2S is a limit raise. You are not even in a game force. So, 3H says Patti is not willing to play 4H opposite a limit raise. The point I was trying to make was that once Dee bids 2S, and Patti makes a weak bid, she should be consistent and bid 4H.|

UP|26|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, lets talk about the auction here. Six diamonds goes down on a spade lead and Dee found the only defense that lets us make 6N. First, let me say that I strongly prefer DONT to CAPP, particularly over the strong NT. DONT lets you compete at the 2 level, whereas cap often forces you to the 3 level. Over weak NT, CAPP has more merit, because it does allow penalty doubles. But I don't think penalty doubles are useful in real life even over a weak NT. In the 40 years I have been playing weak NT, I have only successfully been penalized less than a dozen times. So, if you want to adopt a bid that is successful once every 3 years, be my guest. |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now as to whether Dee should bid DONT. I think she has one of 2 choices. She should either pass or go for the gusto and bid 3H. Double sort of accomplishes very little. 3H is very aggressive, but it has some upside. Now let's look at Patti's hand. She actually has a rule of 20 opener, if you use Marty Bergen's upgrade for the quality club suit. However, I would not open Patti's hand at the one level, Marty Bergen would probably recommend she open it 2S, as he likes to lay claim to the spade suit, and doesn't mind opening weak 2s with a 5 card suit when appropriate. 3C is another possibility. But I think pass is ok as well. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next. let's discuss what I play over strong NT, in terms of a slam try. If Dee had passed, I play all 3 level bids are slam tries. So, playing with one of my regular partners, I would bid 3D with Roberta's hand. If the NT bidder likes diamonds, then he begins control bidding. I suspect what would have happened is I would bid 3H over 3D and roberta would bid 4C. Then, I would bid 4N and go to six. If Dee finds a spade lead we are down. If not we make.  |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, if you play systems on over interference, then roberta could still bid 3D. But, given we have no understanding, 3N seems like the best bid. If they run hearts, so be it.|

PG| ***** 31 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Picture my hand with AKxxxx of diamonds and out, and see where you want to play the hand. Typically, when pard opens a weak 2, you can picture him with 6-card suit holding the two top honors and see if any contract other than his suit makes sense. Otherwise, you can raise with 3-card support or pass. If you are short of his suit, that is a big minus. So, if  you have a singleton or void in diamonds, you need probably 17+ before even considering a bid. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me explain a bit further. A new suit by responder is forcing over a one level opener. And many people also play it is forcing over a weak 2. Whether you play feature or Ogust, is irrelevant as to whether you play new suit is forcing or not. In fact, there is an abbreviation "RONF" = "Raise Only Non Force" over a weak 2. However, playing new suits as non-forcing over weak 2s is gaining popularity, so it needs to be discussed with pard. If in doubt, however, assume it is forcing.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, bidding after a reverse is complicated. Let me explain my methods, which I think are about as easy as they can be. However, bidding over a reverse is not easy no matter what.  First of all what does a reverse show? |
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


AT| It shows a minimum of 16 or so with no upper limit and it is forcing to 2N at least. So, if responder wants to force to game, having at least a good 8, he or she has 2 choices. Responder can either keep the bidding below 2N, as Patti did, or bid 4sf. On most hands that works out okay. |
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2N by responder is not a game force although most of the time it will get raised to 3N. So, if responder simply shows a preference for one of opener's suit, it is not forcing. That is how I play it. To force over a reverse, either bid 4sf or keep the bid below 2N or just bid game if you know where you want to play it. That is always an option.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Opener sometimes has a problem as well. If opener has 18+, then opener must force to game. Therefore, opener must make a bid that forces another bid out of responder, assuming responder has not made a game force. So, for example, in this case, suppose Patti had decided to bid 3C. Roberta has the option of passing. But not on this hand, as she has a game force. So, over 3C, she would have to bid 3D, asking Patti to bid 3N with a diamond stopper. On reverse auctions, it is not clear who is captain of the bidding, which is why it is complicated.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT|^B@2
robzim: How do I know she has 6 spades because she rebid them or could I assume she has only 5 and retreated to them after my reverse?|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You have a problem over 2S, because Patti might only have 5. But you cannot bid 3C, because you know that you want to force to game. Therefore, your only choices were 4S or 3D.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


AT|
isabable: Is 3d asking stopper?|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, 3D is asking for a stopper, because if Roberta had  a stopper she would bid 3N.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What makes bidding after a reverse complicated is deciding who controls the bidding. So, if responder has 8+ it is responder's responsibility to force to game and if opener has 18+ it is opener's responsibility to force to game.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, this hand is a good illustration of Marty Bergen's sneak attack theory. What I am referring to is Elizabeth's bid. Once I bid 3D, it is likely we have game and Elizabeth certainly has an excellent spade stopper. If she was a worry wart, she could worry we don't have a heart stopper. But Marty Bergen says, on this type of auction, just bid 3N with a stopper in the opponent's preempt suit, and don't worry about "sneak attacks" in another suit, such as hearts. |
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, Elizabeth has a clear 3N bid. If they have 5 hearts off the top, and Anna finds the heart lead, so be it. It won't happen most of the time. On another point, Given her excellent spade suit, Anna's spade J is a good lead. If you play coded 10s and 9s, then you lead the 10 which shows a broken sequence with the J (AJ10 or KJ10). Otherwise, you lead the J, as Anna did.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well that worked out well. Let us first discuss whether Anna should open 1C or 1D. Theoretically, with 4-1-4-4 you are better off opening the suit below the singleton. So, many would open 1D which makes rebids a bit easier. But with such nice clubs and so-so diamonds, I think 1C is just as good if not better. If I bid 1H, you can still bid 1S. So, you always have spades as a rebid over whatever I bid. |
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, if your singleton is in spades, 1D probably works out better more often than not because in order to bid hearts you have to reverse, and you should not reverse with 4 cards in your opening suit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You did a squeeze. Yes, Elizabeth squeezed me on that hand. I had to save both hearts and spades but could not do it. My only other comment is her play to the first heart. When I lead a low heart, she should play low from her hand. Once she does that, she will make 4 heart tricks. she will win the 9 in dummy, then finesse the J, and cash the A and K. However, this way she found a more elegant way to make 4 :).|

Unfortunately, that doesn't happen often enough. On many hands, declarer has only mediocre trumps, no great side suit and sometimes has to cope with a bad trump split. Nevertheless, he needs to find a way to make his contract. Let us look at an example from our next lesson.|

You lack the @C 10, so if you lead clubs, you might lose 3 club tricks when both of your honors are captured by the enemy. Instead, how about an endplay? Win the HK with the Ace and draw trumps. Cash the @D A K and discard the @H3. Ruff the @D2 and exit with the @H9. If they give you a ruff-sluff, you'll ruff in your hand and discard dummy's @C2. Once dummy has only 2 clubs, 4S is cold. If E-W lead a club, play 2nd hand low and you will never lose more than 2 club tricks.

HT|g|CP||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|As much as anything else, balancing is a state of mind. When the opponents stop bidding at a low level, you should not simply breathe a sigh of relief that they didn't bid game. 

Instead, your attitude should be: 
"They're trying to buy the contract at a low level. No way!! Who do they think they are playing against -- children?  If they think they can buy the contract at a low level against me, they are sadly mistaken." Instead of meekly rolling over, you should roll up your sleeves and find something to say. After all, if they lack the strength for game, your partner must have something. This hand is an example of what will be discussed at the lesson:|

You'd rather not sell out to 1D, but you don't have a suit to overcall, and double is inappropriate with only two hearts. Is there any alternative to a pass?

In the balancing seat, a 1NT overcall not only shows less than 15 HCP, but it doesn't promise a stopper. All it means is that you have a modest hand with 10-14 HCP; usually with balanced distribution.  If everyone passes 1NT, whether partner has diamonds or not, this should be a sensible contract. Bid 1NT.|

at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie.
