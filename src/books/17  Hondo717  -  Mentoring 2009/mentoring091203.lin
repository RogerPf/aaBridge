^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, these days you can open 1N with even a worthless doubleton. If you don't open 1N with your hand, it is hard to get your points across. Elizabeth is using Marty Bergen's hand evaluation rules to decide whether or not to open 1N. I am not sure I totally subscribe to that theory, but it certainly has validity. Her Starting Points are 15 HCP - 1 for Jx + 1 for the quality club suit. Therefore she has a 1N opener.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I personally prefer overcalling a 5 card major to making a takeout double. I think getting across your length in a competitive auction is important, as you use the law of total tricks to figure out how high to compete particularly in a major. So, my choice would be 1S, although double is certainly reasonable.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once, Elizabeth raises me to 2H, I must reevaluate my hand. I have only 7 HCP, but my hand just got very good. My starting points are 7 HCP plus 2 length points plus 1 quality suit = 10. My declarer add ons are 2 for the singleton and 1 for the sixth heart so my total declarer count is 13. Therefore, I have a 4H bid.|

UP|40|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, this is a hand for demonstrating the law of total tricks. First, let's talk about my 2C bid. If Patti were not a passed hand, I should consider reopening with a double, because it is possible Patti has a hand with spades and cannot bid and I need to protect, in case she has that hand. Since an immediate double by her is negative. Whenever the bidding goes 1x-1 or 2y-p-p, if you are short in y (the overcalled suit), you should strongly consider reopening with a double.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case, I am short in spades. However, since Patti was a passed hand originally, it is unlikely we want to penalize 1S, so I decided to just bid my 2nd suit..Now, about sandy's double. That could be takeout. Her shortness in clubs is an asset, and her length in hearts means dee is probably short. It is possible dee has diamonds, so if you want to play that as takeout, that is fine. |
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My usual rule is that, a double is takeout if 2 specific conditions are met:
1) partner has not bid anything other than pass, that condition was met here;
2) there are at least 2 unbid suits remaining, that condition was not met.
But, many people would take sandy's double as takeout and, dee can work it out since she is long in clubs, so, therefore, it could not be a penalty double.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But playing with my regular partners, I would take it as showing clubs. But that is up to partnership agreement. Now, let's see about Patti. The first pass is ok, although tactically, she might want to bid 3C because she is pretty sure they have a spade fit. I have shown 2 suits, so, although it is possible I have 3 spades, it is more likely I only have 1 or 2. So, although pass is ok, I think 3C is a better choice.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Certainly, once it goes 2S-p-p she should bid 3C. Remember to use the law of total tricks to determine how high to bid and the law has two components:
1. the first component is, with a 9 card fit, bid 3 right away. The law is better for determining how high to bid in competitive auctions;
2. the 2nd component is, if they are at the 2 level, you should bid to the 3 level even with only an 8 card fit. |
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Basically, with an 8 card fit, you should not let them play at the 2 level.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are a couple of ways to play the heart suit. Let's forget about the potential club ruff for a minute, although that is relevant. One way is to finesse dee twice for the hearts, and hope she has at least one honor. The other way is to play the Ace of hearts, and hope that hearts are either 2-2 or one of the honors is singleton. Generally speaking, I prefer the 2nd way, playing the Ace first, although I am not 100% sure which is the best mathematically.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think it is very close. On this hand, since I am worried about a club ruff, I definitely will play the Ace first.|

UP|36|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I already talked about the bidding and play. One other comment. I am a strong believer in opening 1N even with a five card major. Otherwise, I think it is very hard to get your point count across. 1N is a very precise bid. The only time there is any trouble with opening 1N with a five card major, is you might occasionally miss a 5-3 fit. But on hands where opener is 5-3-3-2, often 3N makes just as much as four of a major with an 8-card fit. And when partner has 2 or four of your major, then there is no problem.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, there is very little downside to opening 1N and much upside. I think main stream thinking has come around to that point of view as well, although some teacher still think you should open 1 of a major.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, there were some minor technique issues which I will get to, but lets discuss the 2N bid first. Sandy was a bit lucky there. I think 3C is the appropriate bid, as she doesn't have all that many points, and her spade stopper is suspect. But I learned long ago not to argue with women's intuition, and 2N was the winning bid :).|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, a couple of technique issues. On the first spade, it is fine for Patti to overtake, but she should overtake with the Queen, not the Ace. Third hand, always play the lowest card when you have a sequence. In this case by playing the Queen, dee then knows, when Sandy ducks, that Patti likely has the Ace and King.|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other technique issue was after Sandy won the King of hearts in dummy she can then count nine tricks for sure, four clubs, three diamonds, one heart, and one spade. Then, if she gets lucky in diamonds, she will take ten tricks and she does get lucky. So, playing a heart was incorrect, as it can never gain you a trick and actually lost a trick on this hand. That again shows the importance of counting your tricks.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, the play was fine. Once I figured out where dee had her points. As to the bidding. 1D opener was correct as well. With 4-1-4-4 you should open 1D.  2H and 2S were fine. Sandy certainly has a 3H raise, she has quite a good hand once partner supports, and her spades and diamonds are well placed. Her only concern is that partner will tend to have club points, but I still think she has a clear 3H bid. So, everyone gets an "A" on that hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A couple of things to discuss there. First of all, let's look at Roberta's 2C bid. I don't mind it per se, but if she was planning to rebid 2N, she should open 2N to start with because her auction shows 22-24, and she only has 21. My question is, suppose you opened 2C and I bid 2D, what was your next bid going to be?|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


AT|
robzim: Good question--I don't know.|
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, that's exactly my point. if you open 2C, you need to plan out your next bid.|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


AT|
robzim: Over your 2 hearts -- I can see :  (a) I miscounted losers and (b) I had no rebid.|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But before you open 2C, you must know what you are going to bid over the likely 2D response. I think you have 2 choices on this hand. 1C is one choice. The other choice is 2N. I think 1C is slightly better. 2C is not really viable because you have no good rebid over whatever I bid.|
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let me discuss the 2 alternative response structures to 2C. One is what Roberta plays, 2D promises at least one A or K, and 2H denies an A or K. The other is what is known as 2nd negative. In 2nd negative, 2D can be made with a bust hand and then over a suit bid by Roberta, a bid of your cheapest minor shows a bust hand.|
PG| ***** 140 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, with a bust hand, if it goes 2C-2D-2H/2S a bid of 3C by the 2D responder is how you show a bust.|
PG| ***** 141 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The important cards for responder when partner opens 2C are Aces and Kings. Therefore, a bust is defined as any hand which lacks an Ace or King. Some people use point count, but most experts are more interested in aces and kings. So, even if you have 6 or 7 points, but lack Aces and Kings, you should consider  your hand a "bust" (and that almost never happens in real life). Now, if partner rebids 2N, showing 23-24, of course you should raise to 3 with enough points, even lacking an ace or king. |
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But, in terms of going to slam, lack of Aces and Kings is a big minus regardless of how many HCP responder has. I used to prefer the 2H bust hand, but I have now gone over to the 2nd negative approach because on many 2C openers, partner bids 2N anyway and on most others they bid 2H or 2S. In this hand, once Roberta bids 2N I have a perfect garbage Stayman. So, whatever Roberta bids over 3C I was intending to pass. But since she was nice enough to pass dee's double, I got to play 3D :).|
PG| ***** 143 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One more comment on responses to 2C. Assuming you don't play 2H bust, a 2H or 2S response to 2C promises a 5+ card suit with 2 of the top 3 or 3 of the top 5 honors. If you do play 2H as bust, then some play a 2N bid by responder shows hearts.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, you can count six spades, 5 clubs, and the ace of hearts for 12 tricks. So, here is a good example of where Roberta needs to picture what I have. I bid 3C, so I should have 9 or 10 HCP. I have no spade points (other than maybe the J), and the most I can have in clubs is AJ. So, I have to have something in the red suits. Therefore, it is unlikely she will lose 4 red suit tricks and if I have a doubleton spade, she can count six spades and 5 club tricks. |
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So once I bid 3C, her hand becomes huge, and she bid 4S. The point here is you not only just count HCP, but picture where your tricks are. One of the reasons I bid 3C was to give Roberta an idea of where my cards were, so she could evaluate her hand better.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, we have had some interesting hands today showing the power of good fits. Let's discuss it a little. I could bid 3C, particularly with my singleton diamond but decided not to as my hand was very weak. Anyway, many would not open my hand. It meets the rule of 20, as well as it is only six losers, and has six trick. So, I don't apologize for opening it. 1H was clear, 2D was aggressive, but of course I approve :). |
PG| ***** 180 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4D is a reasonable contract due to law of total tricks, but Roberta should cue bid to show a limit raise. 4D tends to show a weak hand with lots of diamonds, and Roberta's hand is too strong for 4D. If you count dummy points, she has 8 HCP + one for length + three for singleton, and one for having more Aces/tens than quacks for a total of 13 dummy points. Singletons are worth 3 points with 4+ trumps.|

Bid 4S is the correct answer. With this shape, you don't need five trumps. It is very likely that either your side can make 4S, or the opponents can make 4H and you have a cheap sacrifice. By getting to 4S quickly, you put great pressure on the opponents, who may be forced to confirm their fit at the five level. Although they haven't bid 4H yet, this hand illustrates the very important principle:|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie.
