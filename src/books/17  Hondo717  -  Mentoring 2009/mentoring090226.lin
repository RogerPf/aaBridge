^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| First the auction. 2@H was a good bid. shows an invitational hand  and pass was fine by ally. Now, what should I do? One bridge maxim that is often right is "if they have a fit, you have a fit."  In this case, Ira has at most 4 hearts, so I know they have a heart fit  and I am pretty sure Ira has clubs. so even though I have a bad hand, I do have length in clubs and shortness in hearts, so 3@C is a nice competitive bid. We either make or are down 1. I am not sure what double by pam should mean nor if she should make a double.  I play the double by pam suggests a penalty double. |

onoway: I play anything below game ( the first double) is takeout.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, it is not really the first double, ally doubled already. I am not sure I like that approach, particularly on this hand.  I think you can just pass. You already described your hand, 10 or 11 points with hearts, and you have nothing beyond what you said on your first bid.  If you want to bid 3@H, because you have a 5th heart, I guess that would be ok, but I don't see why double should not be penalty oriented there. And, if it were sort of takeoutish, I guess I would assume you have spades and hearts, and if I were ally, I would bid 3@S. The problem hand is when you have 10 points and 4 hearts and 4 spades. If you want to play that as takeoutish, I would think you needed a 4th spade. Now, as to the defense. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| Once Ira does not lead a club, I assume he has the ace. Otherwise I would expect a club lead. Anyway, that is why I discouraged clubs, because I did not have the ace or king, and if Ira has the ace but not the king, I do not want him to lead the suit. Some people who play odd/even play that the even card is suit preference for the other suits. I do not like to play that, I just like to play even discourages. I did make a slight error on defense later in the hand. When I led a spade back, I led the 9, not the 8. I did that automatically, since I had 9 and 8 left, and was leading my remaining count. However, I should realize that Ira is going to ruff the spade, because there is only one spade left between pam and Ira, and if Ira had it, pam would have played the ace on the 2nd spade trick. I should realize pam has another spade, and Ira is out. Therefore, I should lead the 8 of spades left to tell Ira to lead clubs back as the suit preference.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My 9 told Ira to lead the higher suit, diamonds, which he obediently did. As far as Ira originally leading trumps, that could work out well. Someone might be ruffing clubs. And when you have Axx or even Axxx as a trump holding, it is often good to under lead an ace at first particularly Axx. With Axx, partner could easily have 2 trumps. By under leading the ace, if partner gets in, he will have another trump, and can lead it, in which case you play ace and another and draw 3 rounds of trumps.  If you led the ace and another trump first, if partner got in, he is not likely to have a 3rd trump, and you would not be able to draw 3 rounds of trumps, if that is the defense you chose.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand has some very interesting bidding concepts to it. The first two bids are pretty standard. The question is, what tactic is best for Ira, 3@S or 4@S?  I don't think there is a clear cut answer. However, Ira needs to be consistent. If he chooses to bid 3@S, then I think he should pass the 4@H bid. Otherwise, if he was planning to bid 4@S over 4@H, he should bid it right away, before they have a chance to exchange information. If Ira bids 4@S right away, it is much harder for them to double. On the other hand  I think ally's 4@H bid was a bit aggressive. her singleton spade is great, but the rest of her hand is not so good. However once ally bids 4@H, and Ira bids 4@S, pam, you have a very clear double. |
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You have what looks like 3 sure tricks, plus the K of diamonds, plus ally has some strength. You can't let the opponents steal you blind. As I said before, if you only double when they go down, you are not doubling enough.  My main point in discussing what Ira should bid is, if you are playing against strong opponents and you suspect they have game, either preempt to 4 right away, or don't preempt at all. It turns out, 4@H makes if ally guesses the heart suit, or else is down 1.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| Well you did some good things Ira, and you are still down 1. First let me discuss the auction. Why did you choose 4sf as opposed to just bidding 4@H Ira?|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


AT|
IraCT: Because I have a lot of Bergen points.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I understand that, were you thinking there might be slam?|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


AT|
IraCT: Yes.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at|I think that is a bit optimistic on Ira's part, but given he thought there might be slam, Ira chose a very good sequence. Ira has 2 choices over my 2@C bid. He knows he wants to play in 4 hearts at least. So, if Ira thinks there is no chance for slam, he should just bid 4@H right away. By bidding 4sf, and then bidding 3@H followed by 4@H, he is telling me he always was intending to play 4@H. But by going more slowly, using 4sf, he is also telling me he is interested in slam. That is the difference between the approach Ira took (slam try) vs. his bidding 4@H right away over 2@C. Basically, it is another application of the principle of "fast arrival", where, the slower you bid, once you are in a game force, the more interested you are in slam.|

UP|36|PF|Y|cp|8|AT|^B@2^z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We have 2 issues here. First, the bidding tactics.  stef has an optional 1@H call. she is weak, but her ace of clubs is particularly valuable, and good to show her 5 card suit. So I don't quibble with 1@H, but pass would better. steff has a bad hand, with no redeeming value. The ace of clubs is the only good feature of the hand and the J of spades is of questionable value. anna has an interesting tactical choice. 1@S is certainly descriptive, but one could make a case that 3@D is better tactics. Either bid is fine. the reason modern bidding prefers majors is because it is easier to make game in the majors than minors. But in partials, since game is not likely, showing when you have a fit has value and should often be given priority.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2^z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The second issue is defense.As you know, I advocate leading count when you have not supported partner's suit. My six of spades is likely a doubleton.  anna knows that absent a ruff, east will take 2 spade tricks, since the J10 will force out the Q. Therefore, it is imperative she gives me a ruff. Not giving a ruff, will absolutely cost us a trick. Leading a diamond might or might not give us a trick. So the spade is pretty clear.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The spade and heart breaks unfortunate. However, at trick three, because the 10 of hearts was singleton, you should overtake the J of hearts with the K to draw the last trump. It turns out if you do that anna you make all the tricks but one. Now, as to the bidding. darlene has a pass, but some would be tempted to jump to as much as 5 diamonds with her hand as a sac. Given the weak 2, it is fairly clear N/S have game, so 5@D would muck up the bidding. You probably lose 5 tricks, so down 3. As to pushing us to slam, slam is down on a non-spade lead.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Before the play, let me discuss the bidding. Most people play Bergen is off in competition. The reason being, cue bids are now available as a limit raise. And, as on the previous hand, if you know you have a nine card fit, it is usually a good idea to show it. So darlene should definitely make some sort of heart raise. She has a borderline limit raise, but I like 2@C as the bid. However, had she decided that she was not quite strong enough for a limit raise, she should bid 3@H, showing 4+ trumps and less than a limit raise.|
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, once I bid 3@C, there is an important reason why anna should pass, and not bid 3@H. Each new bid should give partner additional information.  anna has what she said she had with her first bid, 10 points or so and 5 hearts. My 3@C bid did not change that.  So, there is no reason for anna to take another bid, as her partner already knows what she has. The only reason for her to bid would be if she had a sixth heart or club shortness. In fact, I would have bid 4@H with the east hand if my partner had bid 3@H.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| stef, I am sure you know about suit preference signals. However, let let me explain. When I lead a heart for you to ruff, the size of my heart indicates which suit to return. If I lead a low heart back, that means I want you to return the lower of the 2 non-trump suit, clubs in this case. If I led my highest heart back, that would ask for a diamond. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| I have 2 choices of bids, either double or 2N. I felt that with only a doubleton spade and a good heart suit, double was better, although 2N has the advantage of getting my points across. Now, the other thing is darlene should normally bid 3@S right away with her hand. A 3@S bid is known as "furthering the preempt." If partner opens a weak 2, and you have 3 card support, you should bid 3 right away..|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| This is part of the "law of total tricks" which says it is safe to bid at the 3 level with a nine card fit. So, unless you are strong enough to bid game, once partner bids a weak 2, you should always raise to 3 with 3 card support. Obviously, you should have at least 6 points.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, that was lucky for us. I have a problem over the 1@H bid. I know we have enough points for game. And it is unlikely we have slam, because my heart points probably don't fit well with partner. We don't have 4 spades, so I figured 3N was the best tactic, and hope partner had spades or they did not lead them. If I bid slower, it will become more obvious to lead spades, so my 3N was an attempt to find the most likely game, while giving the opps as little info as possible.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|anna's lead was correct, given she wanted to lead spades, unfortunately, a low spade works better but from KQ10xxxx, the K is the correct lead. Just too bad, it blocked the suit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well lisa, if anna happened to lead a low spade, stef wins the ace, returns a spade, and anna takes six spade tricks. But once she leads the K, stef is stuck. if she overtakes the with the ace, as she did, the @SJ is set up. If she ducks, even if anna leads another spade, stef has no more spades to get back to anna.|

^-{    BERGEN RAISES    }
^-|CP||fp||at|^-Here is a brief explanation of Bergen Raises by Howard.
^-^B@2^Y@3"Bergen Raises are used by responder after partner opens one of a major and responder has 4 cards in the opener's suit. Reverse Bergen, which I recommend, works as follows. Responder must have exactly 4 card support. The point count specified is "Dummy Points", as defined in Bergen's book Slam Bidding Made Easier.|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


CP|8|FP|2|AT|

- with 5-6 points, responder jumps to 3 of the major (more on this later), |
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


AT|
- with 7-9 responder bids 3 diamonds (known as a "constructive raise"), |
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


AT|
- with a 10-12 responder bids 3 clubs (known as a "limit raise"), and |
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


AT|
- with 13 or more responder bids 2N or Splinter (the usual Jacoby 2N raise played by many partnerships)."|
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


FP||CP||AT|

"One of the important advantages of Bergen Raises is the preemptive jump raise (with 5-6 points). Modern competitive bidding theory says it is safe to compete to the 3 level with a 9 card fit, and Bergen Raises allow you to do this in a way that preempts the opponents."|
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


FP|2|cs|4|CP|8|AT|^-

{"If the intervening opponent bids, Bergen Raises no longer apply."} 

^-|CP||CS||FP||AT|"I suggest you play the following methods over interference. If the opponent bids a suit, 
- a cue bid shows a limit raise (10-12) with 4 card support. 
- a jump raise shows less than a limit raise (5-8) with 4 card support.

Over a takeout double, 
- 2N shows a limit raise or better with 4 card support (this convention is known as Jordan 2N), and a 
- jump raise still shows less than a limit raise (5-8) with 4 card support."

CP||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3"Some people play regular Bergen rather than Reverse Bergen. The idea is basically the same, only the meaning of the 3 club and 3 diamond bids are reverse, 3 clubs showing 7 to a bad 9 and 3 diamonds showing 10-12. The reason I prefer Reverse Bergen is that you want to explore for game more often over a limit raise than a constructive raise, and Reverse Bergen gives your partnership more room to explore. However, if your partner insists on playing regular Bergen, most of the value of Bergen Raises still applies."|
PG| ***** 154 ***** |

"And finally, yes, I still play Bergen by a passed hand. I cannot think of any good reason why Bergen would be off with a passed hand." |

nome: There are more on Bergen Raises from Bridgehands web site at ^*Hwww.bridgehands.com/B/Bergen_Raise.htm^*N or you can read Bergen's book "Better Bidding with Bergen" Vol one page 37. However, your Bergen Raises skill would not be complete until you read Bergen's new book, "Better Slam Bidding with Bergen" which you can order from Howard's web site at ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/^*N. Further, you can down load "Bergen Raises" movie form Howard's web site or from BIL library.|

What you will read next is an attempt to give you most common Bergen Raise treatments in a table. I used the table from Bridgehands as a template and made the upgrading using Bergen's book and Howard's teaching on the topic. The table contains the common treatments in Bergen Raises. The treatment for rare hands and situations which would be the topic of debates between experts are not included. A thorough discussion with your partner is a must before adopting all or part of Bergen Raises.

Bergen in his book plays 1M-P-3M @E@3to show 0-6 points and 4+ card support. However, the following is Howard's approach. "There are 2 ways to play  the meaning of a jump to 3 of a major. It can either show 5-6, and partner should raise to 4 with 18+. Or it shows 0-5, and partner must pass virtually all the time. The only possible exception being she/he is very distributional with long spades and a 5 or 6 card 2nd suit.  --  if she/he didn't open 2@C, then game is very unlikely. I teach the first approach (5-6), but have recently started playing the 2nd approach; the jury is still out as to whether or not it is better.|

^C @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.  

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie.
