^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Elizabeth made a nice lead directing double. One of the things you should look for is lead directing doubles over artificial bids. The most common situations are doubling Stayman, Transfers, and Blackwood responses. Some people play that once Elizabeth doubles, by bidding 2H, East is promising at least 3 hearts, as pass is another possibility. Bbut you and your partner must agree to that, and that has the downside of sometimes wrong sideing the contract.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played. The two points that came up here are:
1) Look for opportunities to make a lead directing double
2) Don't be afraid to make declarer trump, it often makes them lose control of the hand. Another important point is North had a 1D opener by Rule of 20, 11 HCP + 9 in 2 longest suits. 2D is also possible. In fact, if I have a six card suit, my rule is I either open it 1 or 2. There is no gap.|

@D@D nome: Now, if you wish, you can play this hand double dummy. South opened with diamond Jack, however, you can choose a different lead. Just click any card from that hand. When finished or if not interested in the double dummy feature please, click the forward arrow to move to the next board. 
 
Please ^*GHELP,click here^*N for "Instructions and Help Notes" if you need help in how  to play double dummy. However,  you cannot directly get back here. So note your place in the movie in order to return back.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, let's look at my points using Marty Bergen hand evaluation. I have 16 HCP, plus two length points, plus one quality suit point, and less two points dubious doubletons for a total of 17 Starting Points. Once spades are raised, I add one for the extra spade and one for the 2 doubletons, getting me back to 19 Bergen Points--Declarer Points. Therefore, I am close to a game bid. I would bid 4S, but a game try would be acceptable but conservative. Particularly since Patrick gets to play it, lol.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, that was not a good contract. It turns out double dummy it makes but your play was reasonable. You have to play the spade suit for no losers, and your play is the best shot. For those who are not familiar with Double dummy, it means that you can make the hand if you see the 4 hands. Then you would see that Elizabeth has the singleton K of spades, and you could play the hand for no spade losers. |
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, in 4S your line of play in spades was correct, as it is the most likely way to lose no spade tricks. But if you were playing 3S, you can afford to lose one spade trick, so there is a better way to play the suit. I am just just saying the correct play with AQ10xxx opposite xxx to maximize your tricks is A first and then lead low towards the Queen.|

UP|36|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|well I think Patti had a good inkling to try for slam, but then she chickened out unfortunately. Let's see why a good slam is such a good bet. It makes any time hearts are 2-1 or you guess the hearts. And given my preempt, easy to guess the hearts. First, let us add up Patti's Bergen Points. She has 13 HCP, plus two for length points and one for Aces/tens exceed (three Aces and one Ten) the quacks. |
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once Roberta raises hearts, Pattie can add four for her club void, one for her 4 diamonds, and one for her 6th heart. That is 22 Declarer Points. Roberta only needs 11 Dummy Points for slam to be a good bet, plus it is likely Roberta does not have much in clubs. 4N is an okay bid. Normally with a void 4N is not good, but if missing a key card, Patti can assume it is the Ace of clubs. |
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would not dislike it if Patti passed, but once she bids 4N and gets the best answer she can from roberta, one key card, she should bid six. and it turns out six makes. Patti not being consistent is my only objection. One of my principles is when you bid 4N, you must know before hand what you are going to do over all possible responses. The Ace of clubs is irrelevant because Patti is only interested in the King of hearts which Roberta showed. |
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, it is reasonable for Patti to assume it is the King of hearts given the auction. An interesting hand. And shows once again the value of Bergen hand evaluation. Now, as far as preempt is concerned. Marty Bergen has got conservative, but he told me he used to open weak 2s with 4 card suits when he was 25, lol. And the ACBL had to pass a rule banning that because he messed up some ABL bigwig at some tournament.|

UP|32|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, a few things to talk about. First, of all should Roberta transfer, and how do 4 suit transfers work. In general, if you have a weak hand with a long suit opposite a strong hand, it is more desirable to play in the weak hand's suit because in that suit, the long cards will take tricks, whereas in another suit it may not be possible to score the low cards in the weak hand's long suit. So, Roberta's instinct was correct. |
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The only tradeoff is you have to play at the 3 level, which is kind of high. But with 7 clubs and such a bad hand, I think Roberta made a good decision.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


AT|
robzim: I had seven clubs so I thought it was better than leaving my partner in NT.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, how do 4 suit transfers work. Notice that Patti has 2 bids over 2S, either 2N or 3C. Most people play that if Patti bids 2N over 2S, that shows 3 clubs to an honor, whereas if she bids 3 clubs, that denies good club support. That is known as a transfer with "preaccept"  because Patti has 2 bids available she can differentiate between good and bad support, unlike with a major suit transfer. |
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if you play 4 suit transfers then 2N is a transfer to diamonds which is a problem because a lot of people forget that. So, if you play 4 suit transfers, make sure you have a smart partner who does not forget. And, btw, to make an invitational raise to 2N (since a direct 2N is a diamond transfer), you bid stayman first and then 2N. Therefore, if responder bids stayman, on rare occasions she will not have  a 4 card major.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people play a different sort of minor suit transfer. They play 2S is an automatic transfer to 3C, and then responder passes with clubs or corrects to 3D. That is easier to play, but not quite as flexible. I recommend you start with the simpler transfers, as the 2N to diamonds can get you in trouble, and then progress to the more complicated version. Now to the lead directing double by Dee. Normally I am very much in favor of lead directing doubles. However, not sure with AQx it is a good idea. I would like longer spades, and possibly stronger. but I liked the thought. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, Marty Bergen was right, we make 3N but not 4H. On close hands, the one less trick in NT often makes all the difference. Roberta has a clear 3H bid. Her only worry is her 3 low spades, but that's the way it goes.|

MarDef: What is the criterion for bidding 3N and not 4H?|
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you have a close bid and a stopper in the preempt suit. It is often easier to take 9 tricks than 10, unless you think you either have an extra trick via a ruff, or you can set up a long suit in dummy via ruffs. Otherwise, you bid 3N with a stopper if you think you can take 9 tricks and not sure about 10. |
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As far as when to bid over a weak-2. If you are short in the preempt suit, you should strain to bid even with a 5 card suit and opening hand. And with any reasonable six card suit and opening hand you should overcall for sure.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I will teach you folks that preempts work, one of these days, lol. Anyhow, There is a case that Dee should just bid 3N ove 2H. But double and correct might be ok, particularly she really doesnt want Roberta passing. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would probably just bid 3N with dee's hand, figuring with any sort of luck in diamonds, you can count 10 tricks. Now, given the auction, once Roberta freely bids 3S, I would probably do what dee suggested and bid 6N. After all Roberta is showing 10 points, and they are not in hearts nor diamonds. So, they must be in clubs and spades. And if Roberta had even just the King of spades in addition to what she had, 6N makes  or at least had plays.|

However, for this week I am going to present a section from my future project. It is a series of BBO movies based on Howard's lessons on constructive bidding. They would be released as soon as Howard edits them. The part you will see here is on 4-Way transfer.

{4 Suit Jacoby Transfer - Transfer to Minors}

The transfer to minors can be used for 2 purposes

a) To allow responder to bid 3NT with a 6-8 point hand and a six card minor suit,
if opener accepts the transfer. Otherwise, the contract will be 3 of the minor.|
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


AT|
  
b) To play in 3 of a minor with 5 or fewer points and a six card minor.

Most partnerships play Jacoby Transfer for major suits. However, Interested players may use Jacoby transfer for the minors as well. First, let me explain the benefits of transfers in minors.|
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


AT|

In general, if you have a weak hand with a long suit opposite a strong hand, it is more desirable to play in the weak hand's suit because in that suit, the long cards will take tricks, whereas in another suit it may not be possible to score the low cards in the weak hand's long suit. The only tradeoff is you have to play at the 3 level, which is kind of high. However, a weak hand with 7 clubs or diamonds the tradeoff is worth it.|
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


AT|

Some partnerships play 2S which is transfer to minors. Opener automatically responds 3C. The partner bidding the transfer passes with clubs or corrects to 3D. That is easier to play, but not quite as flexible. I recommend you start with this simpler transfers and then progress to the stronger and more flexible version which I explain next.  |

{4 Suit Jacoby Transfer - Transfer to Minors}

^-|AT|^B@2^Y@3
In the more flexible and powerful version, a 2S bid by responder is a transfer to clubs, and a 2NT bid is a transfer to diamonds. Over each transfer bid, opener has two options to further define his/her holding in the transferred minor suit. Let me explain further.|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


AT|

Partner opens 1NT and you bid 2S to transfer to clubs. The opener (no-trumper) now can bid 2N which shows 3 clubs to an honor. Whereas bidding 3C denies good club support.|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


AT|

This is known as a transfer with "pre-accept"  because opener has 2 bids available which can differentiate between good and bad support. As you know the notrump opener does not have such latitude during transfer to majors.|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


AT|

2N bid by responder is a transfer to diamonds. Similarly, after a transfer bid to diamonds, opener has two bids to better define his/her support for diamond suit. Over 2NT, 3C bid by opener shows 3 diamonds to the A, K, or Q and 3D denies good diamonds. |

{4 Suit Jacoby Transfer - Transfer to Minors}

^-|cs||at|^B@2^Y@3

This version of transfer to minor is very powerful but can be confusing because the traditional invitational 2NT bid by responder no longer is available. To make an invitational raise to 2N (since a direct 2N is a diamond transfer), you bid Stayman first and then 2N. Therefore, if responder bids Stayman, on rare occasions she will not have  a 4 card major. You should have a through discussion with your partner if you would like to use this version of transfer to minors.|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


AT| 

One major benefit of this version is that the partnership  can use it to bid thin 3N games. For example, suppose your partner opens 1N and you have AQxxxx of diamonds and out. You might transfer to diamonds, and if partner bids 3C which shows 3 to the K, you bid 3N since you have a likely 6 diamond tricks.|

Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.
