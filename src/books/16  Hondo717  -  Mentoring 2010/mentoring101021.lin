^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding was okay. By the Law, Nada should not bid 3H, because she has neither an extra heart nor a singleton spade. Eddy's bid is corrrect showing 5 spades and 6 points. Double shows exactly 4 spades. Now, Kerrie does have a problem. In general, it is not a good idea to let the opponents play at the two level when you both have a fit. But, her points are soft, 2 queens and the K in their suit. So, pass is acceptable and so is 3H. It is not clear whether they make 3H.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Eddy played it fine. On the surface you will lose 1 H, 1 or 2C, 1D, and 1 or 2 spades. You have as little as four losers and as much as six, depending on how lucky you are. Bascially, you have to hope the King of spades is onside, or the clubs can be played for one loser. You must ruff a diamond as you did. Nada made a very nice play underleading her Ace of clubs. Because even if Eddy has KJ, she makes him guess right away. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, she should have followed it up with A and a low club to give Kerrie a ruff. If Kerrie started with KQx, does not matter, but if Eddy started with KJx, then it does matter. It turns out due to the spade spots Kerrie has a natural spade trick, but give Kerrie K76 of spades and it would have made a difference.|

^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|Often, Howard changes player's bid or play by hitting the undo button as he has the control of the table--teaching table. Then he follows with his instructions. Technically it is cumbersome and time consuming to reinact them in the movie. So, usually as here, I bypass the undoes and I record Howard's instructions either before or after the bid or the play. This board is such a case.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You have a very clear cut bid here Kerrie. You should alwyas show your major if you can. In this auction bidding anything but double or 2H denies 4 hearts. 2C and 1N both deny 4 hearts.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other bid Kerrie might consider is 3C. That is a game try. It is not denying hearts. The negative double promises hearts, So, if she bids 3C, she is saying that she wants to try for the heart game, and Nada should value her club cards. Since Nada has KJ of clubs, she has a clear 4H bid over 3C. But, 3H was a good bid as well.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That was a good auction which we discussed. As to the play, it is true on many hands you do not draw trumps right away. The most common reason is because you need to ruff something in dummy before dummy is out of trumps. However, on this hand, the only thing that possibly needs to be ruffed in dummy is a spade. So, you can afford to draw 2 rounds of trump as there will still be at least one trump left in dummy. In general, you should draw trump ASAP unless you have a good reason not to. Otherwise, the opponents may end up ruffing your good tricks.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand in particular, you should suspect Eddy is short in clubs and although the club Queen has some merit as a lead, on this hand it is extremely helpful to declarer. After that lead declarer can now count 4 club tricks, as long as there are not excessive ruffs. So, it is even more imperative that trumps be drawn right away. As long as hearts are 3-2, (68%), the hand is easy once you get a club lead. An expert might figure out a way to increase the odds, but us mortals should be happy with a 68% contract.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The standard meaning of 2S is a weak jump shift. A weak jump shift is defined as 2-4 points with a six card suit. You are too strong for a weak jump shift. A WJS denies enough points for a 1 level response. You have more than enough points to bid 1S. To think about it, with 4 spades and that hand you would bid 1S. With six spades, your hand is even better. So, why preempt your partner with a better hand. |
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The idea is to preempt the opponents. But, on this hand we have at least an equal number of points as they do, and we own the spade suit besides. Let me give you an undo.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well defense could have beat it one more, but this is fine. The auction needs discussion. Kerrie's 2H bid was very aggressive, particularly vulnerable. It happened to work out well, again proving that aggressiveness often pays off. However, she only has 5 mediocre hearts, she is vul, and we have not found a fit. So, 2H is extremely risky. In general, on this auction, with her hand, I recommend against it. |
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But, let us assume 2H was bid. With my singleton heart, and six diamonds, I felt 3D was merited. And by The Law, Eddy has a clear 3H bid. Let us now discuss Nada's options. It is true she has six spades. However, they are very bad spades, and I did not raise. I might very well have raised with 3 to an honor. She has a singleton in my suit and she has points in their suit. On this hand, she clearly wants to defend. We could easily be beating the hand with the Ace of diamonds, a ruff, another heart to start with.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With the same number of HCP and a diffferent hand, 3S would be merited. |

AT|
hope: What would have been if you left my 2@S bid?|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2S is the wrong bid. We will miss game on many hands where we should be in game. For example, if Nada had KQxxxx xxx Qxx x, 3S would be a great bid. Same number of points, but her points are in her suit and my suit, and her singleton club is probably very useful. |
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand is a good example of how you have to evaluate your hand in the context of the auction. The same hand can be good or bad depending on how the auction goes. On this hand, Nada's hand got worse as the auction proceeded in terms of wanting to play the contract. It got better in terms of wanting to defend. I believe 3H is down 1, depending on how we defend. |
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|By bidding 3S, my hand, on the other hand, got very good. Nada has shown six good spades, so my AQ fill in her suit nicely. My stiff heart is very useful as is my six card diamond suit. Give Nada something like KJ10xxx of spades, xxx of hearts, Jxx of diamonds and QJx of clubs, not a very good hand, and 4S is a great contract. Yet that is the same number of points as what she had, but her points were more useful for offense. In summary, the auction was fine up until 3H. Nada has a clear pass of 3H.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good job Roberta. We already had lots of comments on the play. I have a few minor comments on the bidding. After a 1N overcall, most people still play "|CP|8|AT|systems on|CP||AT|" by responder, as Ann did. So, 2D by Ann is still a heart transfer. 2C is Stayman, etc. Roberta should consider bidding 3H with her hand rather than 2H. In general, with 4 card support for a transfer, you should tend to bid 3 of the major. The only hand not to do it with is a 4-3-3-3 15 or weak 16 count. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, in particular, with no wasted diamond cards, your hand is even better. Now, one other comment. 1N over 1D without a diamond stopper is a bit of a problem. On the other hand, Roberta has no good bid. You could argue for pass, or 1N. Double would be a problem. Marty Bergen would recommend 1N with Roberta's hand (only over a minor opening) so she is in good company. Bergen says with a 1N overcall point-wise and no other good bid, it is ok to overcall 1N witn no minor suit stopper. I think 1N was ok as well. Either pass or 1N works for me.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Interesting hand to bid and play. I had a problem  with my hand. I have 3 choices of bids, all of which are imperfect. I could overcall 1N to show my points. I have some diamond stoppers as even if partner has Jxx I have a stopper. I could overcall 2C, but my club suit is not that great. Or I could double. Generally, with 2 unbid majors, my rule is that you need to be at least 4-3. Since I am only 3-3, I would have to violate that rule. But, since my major suit holdings are so good, I decided it was ok to make a takeout double, as I have really excellent 3 card support for either major.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I guess my rankings for bids would be double 1st choice 1N 2nd choice, 2C third choice. But, it is close, and I would not quarrel with anyone who chose any of those 3 bids. With less than 9 points, Terry's 1H bid was correct. But, once I bid 2H, asking Terry to bid on with a maximum, he might try 3H.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well Terry, I made you bid. You could have zero points and your 1H bid showed 8 or less. Therefore, when I raise 1H to 2H, I must be asking if you have close to 8. I must have at least 17. Otherwise, I would  just pass, since with less than that, I know we do not have game. You have to evaluate your hand in the contrext of the auction.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very interesting hand. I don't blame Roberta one bit for doubling. I would have. The heart void is totally unexpected. Anyway, let me first touch on when to draw trumps. It used to be that most inexperienced players drew trumps too early. However, these days I have noticed many of my students do not draw trumps soon enough. I would say on about half the hands, you should draw trumps right away. Your first instinct should be to "get the kiddies off the street" by drawing trump. So, you have to have a good reason to not draw trumps.|
PG| ***** 140 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The most common reason to not draw trumps is that you have to ruff some cards in dummy before dummy runs out of triumps. With a 5-5 fit (and most often even with a 5-4 fit) it is usually right to draw trumps ASAP. On this hand in particular, Ann only needs 2 diamonds in dummy for her 2 clubs. Therefore, no matter how trumps break, there will be 2 diamonds in dummy. As a general rule, you should always draw trump unless there is a good reason not to. However, to be fair, on more than half the hands, there is good reason to delay drawing trumps but rarely on hands with 10 card fits.|
PG| ***** 141 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, lets talk about the bidding. Everything is fine through 2C. And 2D is fine, but conservative, I might try 3D with Ann's hand. As to Roberta's bid over 2D that is interesting. I think she should bid something stronger than 3C. 2S would be ok, showing a limit raise or better in clubs. 3D would be an interesting bid. In an expert partnership, that would be a splinter (since 2S is available as the strong raise). But, with less experienced partnerships, 2S is fine.|
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, what about my bid? First of all I have a big advantage. I have already passed and partner should know I cannot have much in HCP. In general, if you take a slight underbid, limitiing your hand initially then you can bid a lot later on, as partner knows you have a limited hand. On this particular hand, I passed, so pard knows I cannot have many HCP. But once the auction proceeds my hand gets much better. My diamond support is great and my club void is also excellent.|
PG| ***** 143 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Using Bergen methodology, I can count 2 HCP (the @HJ is likely to be useless), 3 length points, 1 for doubleton spade, and 5 for club void. Remember voids are worth the number of trump you have. So, my crummy hand has grown to be worth 11 points which is why I was very confident bidding 4D. Also, although partner does not have to have 5, she often will. And, in that case, the bid makes sense by The Law of Total Tricks. As you see, we can make 5D with my "crummy" hand with only 16 HCP between us.|

^-|HT|g|cp||FP||at|^b@2^z@3In general, it is usually easier to play in a suit than NT. This is particularly true when responder has a weak hand. Garbage Stayman was invented to allow the contract to be played in a suit at the 2 level when responder has a very weak hand (usually 4 or fewer points).|

HT|j|AT|

There are 2 variations:
* Classic Garbage Stayman
* Major Suit Garbage Stayman

Classic Garbage Stayman works as follows. Responder has a weak hand with at least 4 diamonds and at least 3 cards in each major. Over 1N, responder bids 2C. No matter what opener bids, responder passes. Therefore, the final contract will be either 2D, 2H, or 2S.|

Major Suit Garbage Stayman works as follows. Responder has a weak hand with at least 4-4 in the majors. Over 1N, responder bids 2C. If opener bids 2H or 2S, responder has an easy pass, and is playing in a 4-4 fit. If opener bids 2D, then responder bids 2H. This tells opener that responder wants to play in either 2H or 2S. Opener passes with better hearts, and corrects to 2S with better spades. The final contract is often a 7-card major suit fit (since the NT opener cannot have a doubleton in both hearts and spades), but this is usually better than playing 1N with a weak dummy.|
