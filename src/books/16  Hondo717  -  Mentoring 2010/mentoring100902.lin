^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In NT, honor leads work as follows:

1) The lead of the King (the most common) asks partner to encourage with an honor, discourage with no honor. It is typically done from a long suit headed by King-Queen, so partner usually signals high with the Ace or Jack. Under no circumstances should partner encourage high-low with a doubleton. The lead specifically asks for attitude (e.g. does partner have an honor/) not count.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2) The lead of an Ace asks partner to unblock an honor. It is typically done from AKJ10, so partner should pitch the Queen if he has it. But he should pitch any honor (K, Q, or J). If partner does not have an honor, then he gives count. The reason for giving count with no honor is that the opening leader can then figure out how many cards declarer has in the suit, and will know whether or not it makes sense to continue the suit or hope that his partner can get in and lead the suit through declarer.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3) The lead of the Queen most often is from a 3-card sequence of QJ10 or QJ9. However, on rare occasions, it is done from KQ109 and asks partner to pitch the Jack if he has it. This is so rare, I often don't bother to mention it, but it seems to be a favorite of bridge teachers and authors for some reason. So, the one time in your life when partner leads the Queen in NT and you happen to have the Jack and happen to remember this lesson, discard it.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let's talk about the bidding. Nada should open 1N. Any time you have 15-17 HCP with 4-4-3-2, or 5-3-3-2, or 4-3-3-3 distribution, you should open 1N. 1N is the most descriptive bid you can make so you should go out of your way to open it. Given Nada opened 1D, let's discuss Kerrie's bid. Although technically she has 13 Bergen Dummy Points in diamonds, it is likely we have a major suit fit and it is unlikely they have a game. So, I would choose 3D preemptive rather than 2H. But, that is more of a tactic. Kerrie certainly has the values for a limit raise.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now Eddy has a pass with his hand. But if the hand was just a point or two better, he could double to show a "stolen bid"--2H raise.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


AT|
brockobama: How many HCP does Eddy need to bid 3@h?|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^*B
-- ^*N |cp||at|:A 3H bid by Eddy would tend to show less than a limit raise with 4 cards in hearts. It is important to only bid 3H with 4 card support. The 9th trump is crucial on many hands. In the unlikely event Eddy had a limit raise in hearts, he could bid 3D. Further, a 4H bid by Eddy would show a 5 card heart suit. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In competitive situations, the law of total tricks applies. So, you bid to the level based on the number of trumps. If you have an 8-card fit, stick to the 2 level, with a 9-card fit bid to the 3 level, and with a 10-card bid to the 4 level. Here, if Eddy had a 4th heart, he might bid 3H over 2H. But, his hand is a couple of points shy.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


AT|
hope: I should have bid 3 D instead of 2NT.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Actually hope, you should bid 3N. Kerrie is showing 10 points and you have 15.|

Take/Out double would tend to show a good hand and you have sort of what you said before the double. Further, for all you know, Kerrie has hearts and she certainly has no spades. So, double is probably incorrect there.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, let's discuss the auction. The 2D bid gave Kerrie a problem. It only promises 3 diamonds and it also denies six spades. Kerrie can't correct to 2S, because that is only a six card fit. She has two choices. She can either pass, and hope that Nada has at least 4 diamonds which is what she did. Or she can bid 3C to play. I think, given that her club suit is rather weak, pass is better. But, I would not fault 3C either as it turns out 3C is the best contract. |
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to why I did not bid 3H. There is a good case to be made that I should. But, I was suspicious because Eddy did not overcall 2H right away. I thought 2H when it was bid might mean he has a weak suit, even weaker than what he had.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


AT|
EddyHaskel: That was all my 2h bid was meant to do... you had to have 10+ and it seemed a shame to let them play at two level.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Your 2H bid was good Eddy. I am just explaining why I chose not to bid 3H. It does turn out we make 3H. Anyhow, with good defense in diamonds and a club trick, I decided to try for the set. However, 3H turns out to be right, once again proving the LOTT works. If you follow the law, you are always right :).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, I have an interesting dilemma. If I think Kerrie might have a trump promotion I should lead another heart. But, that helps set up dummy's heart suit. Another possible play is a diamond. However, heart Jack is more elegant. When in doubt go for beauty :).|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|An interesting hand. I think we make 4S. It is close. Let's first discuss Eddy's first bid. 2C is certainly a reasonable choice. Double and correct was another possibility and a 3rd sort of imaginative potability was 1NT. But, that is really stretching it a bit.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4S by Kerrie was clear. Her only other choice would be 3C, but her Queen of clubs is really not worth much, so I think 4S is the standout bid.  Eddy's double was the correct bid. On this auction it is not purely penalty. It just says Eddy has a very good hand, and does not want us to steal it for 4S. It is a "cooperative" double. It says, "Partner I have a good hand. I am willing to defend, but please do something intelligent." |
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nada, with 4 clubs and no defense and a singleton spade, made the best call of 5C. It turned out not to work out that well. But, since we did not double, and we can make 4S, it worked out ok. If she lets the double stand we score +590. This way, Eddy and Nada only went for -300.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|
When the strong hand is to your right, best not to under lead an honor. A club is likely to be your best lead here. A heart is another possible choice. The idea is, whatever high cards I have in clubs are finesseable anyway. Whereas if you lead away from an honor, there is a good chance you are giving the NT bidder an extra trick.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, the idea on opening lead when the NT bidder is on your right, and you are playing in a suit, is to make a passive lead. Passive defense means we try not to give any tricks away. If you have an honor sequence, then it is ok to lead that suit. Otherwise, tend to lead a suit where you have no honors. As it turns out, even if Kerrie leads a diamond, she still gets a diamond trick. But, if I  had the Jack of diamonds instead of Eddy, then the diamond lead could cost an extra trick.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, now let's evaluate my hand and see what to do. I started with eight Starting Points: six HCPs, less one for dubious Jack of diamonds plus 2 length points. Since I know we have at least an 8 card spade fit, now I can count declarer points as well. So, I can add 2 for my singleton Jack, 1 for extra trump card ( six card spades) and 1 for my club side suit to my Starting Points. That gets me up to 12 Declarer Points and 4S seems right.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nice try Nada. I actually think we should have bid slam on that hand even though it goes down 1. I am showing 20 points. Nada has 17 Declarer Points--14 Starting Points, one point for the 2 doubletons, and 1 points for the sixth spade. That is clearly enough for slam in terms of having at least 33 combined points. So, 4N was fine. Nada should bid a small slam if she either have all the key cards or she has 4 key cards and the Queen of trumps. |
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case, we have 4 key cards. But, since Nada knows I have 4 spades, she does not even care whether or not I have the Queen of spades because even if she is missing the Queen, as long as trumps are 2-1, the Queen is coming down. Therefore, she should bid slam. It turns out to be down 1 because the club finesse loses. But, it is certainly a reasonable slam.|

As many of you know, last Thursday Howard held his first session in the series on|CP|1|AT|
Fundamentals of Constructive Bidding.|CP||AT| The session was on Introduction to Constructive Bidding and was attended by more than 170 students. 

As those of you who attended know, because of the large attendance, to keep things flowing, we asked the students to send me the questions rather than to public chat them. Further, it was the intention to answer the questions in the movie. However, several students wished to email their questions. Wishing to send the movie out ASAP I decided to place the answers to those questions in this week's mentoring session movie which you can see next. The updated version of the BBO movie covering that lesson, which you can down load from BIL library or Howard's web site ,includes the answer.

PG| ***** 144 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is true that theoretically, you may end up bidding game with 12 opposite 12 in terms of HCP. However, on virtually all hands, there are add ons for distribution and/or length that bring the total up to 25 combined points. And even if that is not the case, 25 points is an approximation; you can make often make game with 24 combined points. Also, 12 opposite 12 is the best distribution of combined resources, as it usually means that you have the most flexibility in how you play the hand in terms of managing entries.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|"new minor forcing" is not 4th suit forcing. New minor forcing and 4th suit forcing are not at all the same. I also find a lot of confusion about what constitutes new minor forcing.|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


at|

As to 4th suit forcing. 4th suit forcing is a convention that only applies when opener bids one suit, responder bids another suit, and opener rebids a third suit. That leaves only one unbid suit. If responder bids the remaining unbid suit (the "fourth suit"), that is the 4th suit forcing convention if you play it. It simply establishes a game force, is completely artificial, and says nothing about the fourth suit. Responder will clarify why he or she bid the 4th suit on the next bid. Opener should try and  bid NT (but only with a stopper in the 4th suit, as responder is not guaranteeing a stopper in the fourth suit) or raise responder's first suit with 3 card support. If opener cannot do that, he or she must rebid one of their suits.|
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


AT|

New minor forcing is a very specific convention that only applies when opener rebids 1NT or 2NT. It does not apply on any other auction (e.g. 1D-1H-1S-2C is fourth suit forcing, not new minor forcing; also 1S-2D-2S-3C is natural, not new minor forcing). Typical new minor forcing auctions are 1C-1S-1N-2D and 1D-1H-1N-2C. New minor forcing asks the opener about his or her major suit holdings. Opener should raise responder's original major suit with 3 card support, or bid a 4 card major (usually hearts).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 4th suit is always artificial, and can certainly be used to ask partner to bid NT with a stopper in that suit, However, there are many other uses for 4th suit forcing. It simply establishes a game force. Responder will clarify why he or she bid 4th suit forcing on their next bid. My 2 Over 1 Part 1 tutorial on my web site has a good explanation of 4th suit forcing.|

kib: Put in the movie somewhere what is balanced and what is unbalanced distributions.|
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For the purposes of opening 1NT, I recommend you have no more than 1 doubleton. So the valid distributions for opening 1NT are 4-3-3-3 4-4-3-2 and 5-3-3-2.

I consider any distributions with no singletons or voids as "semi-balanced". Semi-balanced distributions are better for NT and worse in suits. So, the semi-balanced distributions are 5-4-2-2, 6-3-2-2, and 7-2-2-2. Some people will open some semi-balanced distributions 1NT as well (probably not 7-2-2-2 but the other two); I personally do not recommend that.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First of all, in order to reverse you must have 5+ cards in your first suit, and 4 cards in your second suit, so your hand is unbalanced by definition.

As to whether your should reverse with 15 points, it is possible but a tad weak to do so. I would reverse with the following hand: xx AKxx AKJxxx xx. But I would not reverse with Qx AJxx AJxxx Kx.|

PG| ***** 156 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I will tend to rebid a 5 card minor with an unbalanced hand (for example 1-4-3-5), particularly if I have a small singleton or doubleton in an unbid major. In match points, you do tend to favor rebidding 1N over 2 of a minor, due to the way the scoring works, so occasionally I might rebid 1N in match points and rebid my minor with the same hand in IMPS. But those examples are fairly rare. Most people tend to overemphasize no trump in match points.|

kib: What about a Rule of 20 Opener?|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The rule of 20 is recommended by Bergen to determine if you have an opening hand. You add your raw HCP to the length of your 2 longest suits. If the total is 20 or more, you should open the hand. For example, an 11 point 5-4-2-2 hand is an opener (11 + 9 = 20), as is a 12 point 4-4-3-2 hand (12 + 8 = 20).|
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


AT|

kib: When opener reverses does he promise to bid again (assuming responder doesn't jump to game)?  Howard's pm answer was, "Yes but it's complicated."  Please explain in movie.  Thanks!|
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is no universal agreement as to how reverses should work. This is the simple approach I use:

1) A reverse forces the auction to end no lower than 2NT. Therefore, if responder's rebid is less than 2N, opener must bid again. If it is higher, opener is not obligated to bid again, except as specified in rule 2.

2) If responder has a medium or max hand, he or she is responsible for making sure their side gets to game. Therefore, with a medium or max hand, responder must do one of the following:
    a) Bid game if possible
    b) Bid 4th suit forcing
    c) Jump in their suit
    d) Make a bid below 2N

If responder fails to do any of those, then opener may pass, and they are not forced to game. Of course, if opener has a max hand, then opener is responsible for making sue their side gets to game when responder makes a non-game forcing bid.|

PG| ***** 162 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A jump shift shows a max hand. As I said, medium hands are difficult to show, and sometimes opener  cannot show a medium hand. On the  example auction, theoretically opener could have as much as 17. Fortunately,  with many medium hands, opener starts with 1N or reverses. But there are some hands in which opener does not jump or reverse, but still might have as much as a bad 17. Responder needs to keep that in mind, although it turns out it in real life, it is not as much a problem as one might think.|
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


AT|

kib: He was discussing a Simple rule for Reverse Bidding. As a responder, if you hold a medium hand and know you must be in game, but not sure where you want to play it, bid 4sf to game force.  So as a responder, if you make any bid but game or 4sf, you are not forcing to game. What does 4sf mean? I am a beginner,and don't understand reverses, but I will try to learn.|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As explained above, 4sf means the "fourth suit forcing" convention.

As a beginner, I suggest you be aware of what a reverse is (in other words, don't reverse unless you have a medium or max hand), but don't worry too much about the auction after the reverse occurs.|
