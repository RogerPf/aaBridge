{      Beginner Intermediate Lounge, Our Home      }
^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good try Anna. The bad splits doomed you. Lets discuss the auction. Even "Mr. Preempt", Howard thinks 3D is a bit aggressive, although Elizabeth's spade void is very nice. 3S was fine by Anna. My 3N showed a strong NT with five spades and some diamond cards, probably AQ given that you had the King. And given you have the King of diamonds, which now appears useful, plus a nice club suit, I think pass is very appropriate. It turns out because of the bad splits, neither 3N nor 4S makes. With strong NT, the bidding probably goes 1N-P-3N or 1N-dbl-3N if they decide to bid DONT.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, Anna can count 3 diamonds, 2 spades and 2 clubs for sure. Once spades don't break. Anna's best play is probably to hope clubs break. That will give her two extra clubs tricks, and if they don't find the heart switch or East has the Ace, then the contract makes. So, starting the spades was |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, I have a problem. I could bid 2N, but then I might end up playing the hand, and it is more advantageous for Anna to play the hand. It is better when the strong hand is concealed  and also when the opening lead goes towards the strong hand. So, this is why Anna should rebid 2N, showing 22-24 balanced and why Puppet Stayman was invented.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's talk about the play first. Once the opening lead is made, Anna can count 4 club tricks and two tricks in each of the other suits for a total of at least 10 tricks. She can also count on a third spade trick, no matter who has the Queen. And, if the diamond finesse works, she can count on three diamond tricks. Anyway, Anna has 11 tricks for sure, and possibly 12. So, her best line is probably King then Jack of spades which sets up an extra spade for her. Then she can take the diamond finesse, since she still has double stoppers in all suits and can end up with 12 tricks.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a better line than trying to set up hearts, which requires a 3-3 break. Remember, 3-3 breaks are less likely than 4-2 breaks. The general rule about suits breaking is:|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If there are an odd number of cards out, the suits tend to break as evenly as possible. So, if you have an 8 card fit, the most likely break of the outstanding 5 cards is 3-2. But if you have an even number of cards out, the most likely break is not an even break. If you have a nine card fit, 2-2 is not the most likely break, 3-1 is more likely. With a 7-card fit, 3-3 is not the most likely break, 4-2 is. You do not need to know the exact odds. The important thing to remember is that with even number of cards out, an even break is not that likely. You should not count on it unless that is the only way to make the hand.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now back to Puppet Stayman. It is used over 2N openers, and 2C followed by 2N rebids (which, as I said before, is essentially the same thing). Opener often has a 5 card major in these auctions. So, Puppet Stayman allows you to discover both 4-4 fits, and 5-3 fits if opener has the 5 card major. It works as follows.
With a 5 card major, opener bids her major, as Anna did.
With a 4 card major, opener bids 3D, which specifically shows one or both 4 card majors.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If opener has no 4 or 5 card major, she bids 3N.
Now, if opener bids 3D, and responder has a 4 card major, it gets a bit tricky because the idea is, you want the opener (the strong hand) to be the declarer. If responder has a 4 card major, she does not want to bid that major and be declarer so, responder bids the other major.
The auction 2N-3C-3D-3S, for example, means responder has 4 hearts. Then, if the 2N opener has 4 hearts, she can then bid 4H. If she has 4 spades she can bid 3N.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Similarly if responder has spades, the auction goes 2N-3C-3D-3H where 2N opener bids 4S with four spades and 3N with four hearts. Further, if responder has both majors, then she knows they must have a fit then she bids 4D. Thus, the auction 2N-3C-3D-4D shows both 4-card majors in responder's hand and opener bids her 4 card major. It sounds complicated, but if you practice it a little bit, it makes sense. Having said that, I do not play Puppet with my wife Ava, and we have not missed it, lol. So, if you want to skip Puppet, it probably won't hurt your bridge. BTW, all Puppet bids are alerted.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's talk about the auction first. I got a question about should Elizabeth (when she was sitting South) bid Stayman. Playing normal Stayman, you need at least an invitational hand to bid Stayman. In general, you should not bid Stayman unless you have at least 8 points. Therefore, the 2D transfer was a good bid on this hand. There is a variation of Stayman that I play, which I like. I am sure that most of you know about Garbage Stayman. That is where responder is short in clubs, and has long diamonds and at least 3 cards in each of the majors and a weak hand. With that hand, responder passes whatever the response is to Stayman. With a weak hand, and short clubs, normally it is better to play in a suit. |
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is a variation of Garbage Stayman that I like, and it comes up quite a bit. I play if the auction goes 1N-2C-2D-2H, that is also Garbage Stayman but it shows at least 4 cards in each major. The 1N opener is supposed to pass with better hearts, and correct to spades with better spades. Had Elizabeth been playing that version of Garbage Stayman, she could have bid 2C. In that case the auction goes, 1N-2C-2D-2H-P. And if North happened to have longer/better spades, North would correct to 2S. I am not saying you should play it, but I happen to like it. However, you better agree with your partner before trying it.|

Some people these days would open her hand 1N, but I still prefer the traditional distributions that have no more than 1 doubleton. The double by Elizabeth was fine as my 1S and 2C by Anna. Now, we have some issues. Elizabeth has a clear pass. The general rule is, if you have already described your hand, don't bid it again. Elizabeth, with her double, already promised spade tolerance and an opening hand and that's all she has. Had I bid 1H, she had a small case to bid 2H. But with only 3S and a minimum hand, there really is no reason to bid 2S. I am not sure I would bid 2H even had I responded 1H. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|They have a known 8 card fit at least, and good chance Anna has six clubs and  3C is the bid. Elizabeth was lucky to go down only one, if spades were split differently, down two at least. Now, back to Kia. By the law of total tricks, and my competitive guidelines, Kia should bid 3C. Remember, if they have a fit and you have a fit, you should always bid to the 3 level if they are at the 2 level. And you should bid 3 over 3 if you  have a 9 card fit or a singleton in their suit. Those are good guidelines to remember, easy and very effective.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, this was really a fairly straight forward hand had spades broken. In IMPs, Kia's line of play is fine but you can make 5. Starting to draw trump was fine. But once they break 4-1 you should abandon trump and play a heart. Then you can ruff dummy's last heart in your hand, and only lose 1 spade and 1 heart. If Elizabeth draws your last two trumps, you can pitch dummy's third heart on your K of clubs. Alternatively, you can unblock the Ace of clubs at trick two and then after drawing trumps, pitch dummy's last heart on the King of clubs.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Anna asked if I would bid 1S or 2S with her hand.  I would overcall 1S, as I think she is too strong for 2S. But 2S could work out, and it turns out it works better on this hand. It gives me a big problem. I like my heart support and singleton spade but am a bit weak for 3H. I probably bid 3H anyway, and Kia bids 4.|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play although I don't like doubleton leads, Anna really has no good choice other than clubs. She might lead a spade hoping partner has the Queen or Ace, but that is risky and does not work well on this hand as it turns out. |
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once Kia gets a club lead, he should probably think about setting up dummy. If he plays another club at trick 2, basically, he will lose 1 diamond and 1 club and make 5. So, that is the best line on this hand: just play another club. Most players have a hard time visualizing setting up dummy. But it is a good thing to keep in mind.  |
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I did a bridge puzzle a while ago. I presented a hand, asked people how they would play it, and most everyone made it. Then a couple of months later, I gave the same hand, except I reversed dummy and declarer, and most people went down. So, there is some interesting psychology there. Most people find it easier to set up declarer's hand than dummy. If you can learn to look at both hands equally, you will improve your play, as this hand illustrates.|

Whether playing Match Points or IMPS, bid 3NT, rather than 3C. All you need from partner to make this is the heart Ace or spade King. Don't worry about diamonds. The likelihood of their leading diamonds and taking five tricks in that suit is very very low. |

Neither side is vulnerable. Bid 4H is the correct bid.  Your side has 10 trumps. That is much more relevant than the fact that you have 11 HCP. Can you picture that even if partner's only useful assets are a doubleton diamond and the heart king, you are a strong favorite to only lose three tricks in the black suits?|

at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie.
