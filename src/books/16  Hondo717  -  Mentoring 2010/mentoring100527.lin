Movie Maker|CP||AT|: Last week I had a bumper crop. I attened the session on Wedensday and BAM. The first board was a bridge student's delight. It had so many learning topics that takes me months to cover Howard's teaching on those topics. So I decided to bet the farm on this one board and forget the rest. This fits well with the new trend I will following, with Howard's approval of course, which is use few boards but increase the topics explained in more details.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

Therefore, I have arranged the board in an inter-active learning tool covering Jacoby 2NT, Spinter, control bidding, Roman Key Card Blackwod and King asking. Then, to enhance Howard's teaching I have extensive supplimentary information to Jacoby 2NT and King asking which you can either review when it is used in the board and come back to where you have left off or finish the board and review each topic separately. I will prepare the additional information on Control and Splinter Bidding with the next few weeks presentations. Further, you can test your Bergen's hand evaluation skill as a bonus. Under the link to Board one you can see the links to those topics. I learned and enjoyed preparing this particular presentation and I hope that you do too.|

The material in part are from Howard's four lesson series on Slam bidding which he held last year. You can down load those lessons either from BIL library or from Howard's web site. They are:

Starting Points (prior to auction   
Dummy Points and Declarer (Bergen) Points  
Control Bids and Blackwood   
Splinters, Jacoby 2NT, and 5NT Pick A Slam.|

The colors may be not the same throughout this presentation because each section is from a separate file with different coloring format. So, please forgive me for the kaleidoscope. Finally, I prepared them early 2009 and you will see that I could see into the future in my dream!|

{      Beginner Intermediate Lounge, Our Home      }
^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, actually Hope has a wonderful hand once I bid 2N. So, it would not be wrong of her just to bid 4N right away over 2N. She has all the suits controlled, and enough points to guarantee slam if I have two key cards, or one key plus the Queen of spades. So, she might very well bid 4N over 2N, although 3D is certainly fine. As Marty Bergen says, "He (or she) who knows goes," and Hope knows we have slam.|

mb|3S|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As I mentioned, I have an ideal holding opposite shortness.  I want no wasted diamond honors. So, either 3+ small or 3+ to an honor is ideal. That is the reason I decided to bid 3S rather than 4S. Since we are forced to game, 3S cannot be passed. It says, "Partner I am interested in slam, please bid your controls." |
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4S would be "Fast Arrival." Fast arrival is the following principle. When you are in a game forcing auction the faster you bid game, the weaker your hand. So, if I was not intererested in slam over 3D I would bid 4S. By bidding 3S, I show some slam interest.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding was the most interesting part. Although we made 7, actualy I guess six is best with two Kings missing. Next, let's discuss the auction as it went. My 3S is a 2-part bid. Let me briefly discuss a convention called the "Serious 3N", which some experts play. If you play that, and I bid 3N rather than 3S, that says, "Partner we are going to slam if we have controls," you must start bidding controls. 3N forces a control bidding sequence. |
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3S on the other hand, says the following: "Partner I am interested in slam if you have a good hand." "If you have a good hand, make a control bid." However, "If you are not interested in slam, just bid 4S." So, if Hope had a min hand, over 3S she could just bid 4S.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One other thing to discuss is responses over 5N. There are two ways to respond to 5N. One is called "Specific Kings." That happens to work very well on this hand. 5N asks me if I have any Kings (other than the spade king). If I have a specific King, I am supposed to bid the suit in which I have the King. On this hand, playing specific kings, had I bid 6C showing the Club King, Hope could bid 7. |
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, I happen to play number of Kings. So, 6C = 0 King, 6D = 1 King, 6H = 2 King. On this hand, that would not be quite as good, since Hope needs me to have the King of clubs not the King of diamonds. But on some hands, number of Kings works better. Therefore, you and your partner need to decide what to play over 5N. One additional point. Some player play specific Kings when in suit contract (Blackwood) and play nmber of Kings with Gerber as Gerber is always number of kings.|

at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N

|cp|8|cp||AT|^C@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|I teach the same method. I think it makes a lot more sense to preserve bidding room, such that |cp|8|at|bidding a 5 card suit should be reserved for a really good 5 card suit and a weakish hand|cp||at|. With a mediocre 5 card suit, I think it makes more sense to show your shortness instead. (You have to have shortness, since if you have another 5 card suit, mathematically you must have a singleton or void.)|

^C@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|In answer to his other question, also I told him  the opener's rebid after Jacoby 2N is not a control bid. It has a specific meaning, either to show shortness or a very good side suit. Barring shortness and a very good side suit, opener makes a rebid describing the hand strength (3 major with a maximum , 3N with a medium, or 4 major with a minimum hand).  Any bid after opener's first rebid is then a control bid.|

PG| ***** 77 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not at all Marty. It is indeed a pleasure to have you in our session. I guess kia was not dreaming after all. |
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


AT|

This is the final lesson of fout on slam bidding. To review, the first 2 lessons were on hand evaluation. They were the most important, as they apply to all auctions, partials, games, and slams. Just as a reminder. If you use Bergen's methods of hand evaluation, you ^*Ineed 26 points between the combined hands^*N to bid game. If you have 33 points or more, you are in the slam range.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


at|

However, just because you have 33 points, it does not mean you should automatically bid slam . You need to make sure you do not have two losers off the top. That means you have to have first round control (ace or void) of 3 suits, and 2nd round control (King or singleton) of the fourth suit.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


AT|

Control bids were the topic of the third lesson, last week. In that lesson, I discussed control bids and Roman Key Card Blackwood, which are used to make sure you have the necessary controls in all suits. So, we now have the theoretical foundation about what we need to bid slam, and how to stop if slam cannot be made. |
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


AT|

This week's lesson will be on two common conventions that can help get us to slam,|HT|w|cs|4|AT|^C{ ^GJacoby 2N                    }  ^mand ^o{                        splinter bids                      } |
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


CS||AT|


OK, let's start with Jacoby 2N

^-|HT|f|cp|8|fp|2|AT|
^c@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|As most of you know, when partner opens 1 of a major, and you have 4+ card support and a game forcing hand (at least 13 dummy points), you bid 2N to show that hand. That convention is known as |cp|8|at|Jacoby 2N|cp||at|.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


AT|

Bergen recommends that you always bid 2N with 13+ dummy points and 4 card support. Therefore, if you do not bid Jacoby 2N but show a game forcing hand, and later raise the major, you can only have 3 card support at most. That is an important negative inference. if you do not bid Jacoby 2N after showing a game forcing hand, you cannot have 4 card support of the major. A 9-card trump fit is much better than an 8 card trump fit. it is almost worth an extra trick.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


AT|

So Bergen recommends you tell your partner the good news immediately. The only exception to this is on hands where you have shortness, you can splinter instead of bidding Jacoby 2N. But splinters also show 4 card support and game forcing values. Therefore, absent a splinter or Jacoby 2N, if responder has shown a game forcing hand, he does not have 4+ trump support.|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


AT|

Now, let us look at a few examples. As in the past I show you the hand and the auction. Count the value of the hand and then choose your bid. I will give the correct answer afterward. |

^B@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||fp|2|at|2NT is correct. First of all, you cannot be too strong to bid Jacoby 2N. So even though this hand is very strong, you still should start with 2N.

AT|

You should not splinter with a strong hand, 17 or more dummy points, even with shortness. The reason being that splinters take up a lot of bidding space, and with 17 or more, it is more important you leave room for slam exploration.|

You need a good 5 card suit, either 2 of the top 3 or 3 of the top 5 and  and 13 HCP or less. This hand qualifies, so 4@C is the bid. By "HCP" I mean Raw HCP. Here, Bergen does not use Bergen points.

^B@2^Z@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|3@H is the correct bid. This hand is worth 19 Declarer points. Remember, when calculating points for length, you use regular length points for starting points (3 for 7 card suit). You then double dip, by adding extra points for trump length above 5, so you add 2 additional points for the 7 card heart suit if that is the trump suit.

So far my results have been very good using Bergen's methods. at worst, I have bid some slams on 1 finesse.

^C@2^Y@34@D is the correct answer. This is a case where you have to take into account the double fit. If you have controls in all suits, you can count 12 tricks 5 clubs, 1 diamond, 5S, and a diamond ruff, since you can pitch your diamond on the last club. So, you should bid 4@D, to make sure you have hearts controlled. If partner bids 4@H, you can then bid 4N. Then, if you are missing one key card, bid 6, if missing no key cards you can bid a grand slam. Basically, you can picture 12 tricks, since you know partner is 5-5 in hearts and clubs. However, if partner bids 4S, you must pass, because you know you have 2 heart losers.

^C@2^Y@3Great fit. 4NT is the correct bid. This is a hand with a great fit. Bid 4N because you control all suits. If partner is short in hearts, you have no wasted heart points, it is as if you only have to worry about 30 HCP, need not worry about the heart points. So, if you are missing one or zero key cards, bid six. That is really all you need to know.

^-|HT|i|cp||AT|^c@2^Y@3As a firm believer of repetition I would like to  repeat Howard's instructions but in a different format. I easily learn to bid X when I have a hand with Y properties. However, when I am sitting on the receiving end I am lost when my partner bids X because I cannot remember what those properties are. So, I like to repeat it over and over and look at it from both sides of the table.|

To that end I have constructed the most common Jacoby 2NT auctions for our review. Together, in each auction we try to determine what the bid by partner promises. We are sitting South in all auctions. It is not a quiz. Review the auction, make your interpretation then click the forward arrow to look at the correct answer. As always there could be other, as Howard calls them, meritorious answers. But, let us look at when 2NT is a Jacoby 2NT. The following are only when 2NT is a Jacoby.|

Also, not long ago, with Howard's help I made "Bergen Raises" movie which has a summary of both Jacoby 2NT and Splinter Bids. So, to give Eddy the credit he deserves I combined his work with the material from that movie which you will see next.

HT|g|cp|8|FP||AT|
^c@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once the Blackwood bidder receives a response to 4N, he may then bid 5N as a king ask. There are two variations to the King response. The variation I have a preference for is to respond with the number of Kings (obviously not counting the King of trumps).|
PG| ***** 213 ***** |


AT|

- 6@C = 0 Kings, 
- 6@D = 1 King, 
- 6@H = 2 Kings, 
- 6@S = 3 Kings. |
PG| ***** 214 ***** |


AT|

The other variation is "specific Kings". If you play that, then you respond with the cheapest suit in which you have an outside King; if you do not have an outside King, you bid six in the agreed upon trump suit. If you play "specific Kings" and you have two Kings, you bid the lowest King you have. |
PG| ***** 215 ***** |


AT|

The main complication playing specific Kings is if your specific King is in a suit higher than the agreed upon trump suit. I play that you should respond with your specific King even in that case (partner needs to be prepared for that response), but some people play you can only respond with a specific King if it is in a suit lower than your agreed upon trump suit.|
PG| ***** 216 ***** |


AT|

Also, most people play that if the Blackwood bidder bids 5N as a King ask, that guarantees your side has all 5 key cards. That allows the responder, on rare occasions, to bid seven if he has a hand with an undisclosed feature that will most likely allow seven to make (such as a long solid side suit, which will generate many tricks).|
