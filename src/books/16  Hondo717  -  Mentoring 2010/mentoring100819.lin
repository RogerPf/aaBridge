^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

qx|BACK|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, let's talk a little about gambling 3N. Some people play that you open 3N with a long running minor suit. The classic gambling 3N is with an 8 card minor with at least the top 3 honors. Some people also feel you should have no outside Aces. Kerrie did not really have a classic gambling 3N. She only had a 7 card minor. It was a reasonable gamble that it would take 7 tricks, even without the Jack of clubs. Because as long as I have at least 1 club, she is odds-on favorite to take 7 tricks. However, I was just informed that some people play 7 to the AKQJ is okay for gambling as well. Click |CP|1|at|^*GNOM,here^*N|CP||AT| to read more on gambling 3NT. You can return here afterwards.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Anyway, as usual, I am not quite as disciplined. I play it does show a long minor, and an 8 trick hand but that is it. You could have 8 solid in the minor or 7 solid and an outside Ace or even 8 solid and an outside Ace. I think trying to make it disciplined is a bit silly. You are either a "gambler" or you are not. Basically you are betting that 3N is the right place and that more often than not you will be right.|

MarDef: Do you have to alert the bid?|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^*B
-- ^*N |cp||at|: Yes you do have to alert.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, if you are the partner of the 3N opener and you end up getting doubled, if you don't have any tricks, you probably want to pull the double. If doubled, redouble tells partner to bid her suit. If not doubled, then 4C says pass or correct. Here I wanted to double them in whatever they played. I only had 1 club, and had enough stuff outside that I felt we would beat them. Had I decided I did not want to defend 4S, I can bid 4N to ask Kerrie to bid her suit.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT|^B@2
hope: We came out better than let you have a game.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case yes, as Kerrie does make 3N. Actually double dummy we can beat you three, because I can encourage Kerrie to lead a heart at trick 3. If Kerrie leads a heart, because she has the Queen of spades, we can end up taking an extra spade. However, that is double dummy defense. It looked to me like a third club would be better if Kerrie only has 7 clubs. Because a third club sets up my Jack of spades if Eddy has another club, even if Kerrie only has low spades.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT|^B@2
EddyHaskel: Howard, when is a double by partner of 3N gambling opener a takeout?  How to know if it is a penalty?|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Actually most people play it as penalty oriented. But, for now, I don't want to get into too much specifics. In this hand 4S was a very reasonable call no matter what my bid meant.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |

@D@D nome: Now, if you wish, you can play this hand double dummy. The opening lead was club Ace, you can choose a different lead. Just click any card from that hand. When finished or if not interested in the double dummy feature please, click the forward arrow to move to the next board.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's talk about Nada's obligations here. Nada is what is known as "captain" of the hand. That means she is responsible for making sure their side gets to the right contract. On most hands, responder is "captain." Her job is to ask questions, and place the contract. On this hand, once Kerrie opens, Nada's first thought must be, "We have game and I have to make sure I do not make any bid that partner can pass below game."  2C not only can be passed, but usually will be. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, depending on what they play, Nada has to make a forcing bid. Personally, I would just bid 3N with her hand, as that is almost certainly where the hand should play. If she plays 4th suit forcing to game, then she could bid 2H which establishes a game force. But there really is no point, as she knows they should be in 3N.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I have a tough lead. Double dummy it is obvious what to lead. But I would never find that lead at the table as it is very likely to be wrong. Leading from Qxx is usually a weak lead. But, since that is the unbid suit, that is probably the best lead.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now,  because Eddy led back a low heart, I know Nada only has 1 left as Eddy started with 4 and the rest of us had 3. Next, however, it is time for me to count out Nada's honor cards.  I know she had the Ace of hearts. She most likely has the AJ of clubs. She most likely has at least one diamond honor card, say it is the Queen. That gives her 11 points, or 12 if it is the King. So, it is possible she has no spade cards. |
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is also possible she is missing the A of clubs and has the King of spades. Therefore, if I were playing at the table and could not see the four hands (I can see spade is the correct return here), I would play a  heart. This is hard for me to say, as I can't really honestly say what I would play here.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I should really have made Nada play the diamond suit differently as the way she played it was incorrect. The correct way is to play me for the Queen of diamonds. I am not saying Eddy should cover, but if he had, she is guaranteed to lose a diamond trick.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


AT|
texall: North should have covered with @DQueen.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No North should not cover. Suppose Nada had AJx opposite K109x. By playing the Jack, if Eddy covers, that eliminates a guess. So, playing low is correct. Second hand should virtually always play low. That is my single most important cardinal rule of defense. The correct play is to play a diamond to the Jack. It doesn't happen to work  here, but it is usually the best play. |
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT|^B@2
texall: You don't ever cover an honor with an honor?|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me explain again. If someone leads the Jack off the board, it is rarely right to play the Queen. Again, suppose West has AJx and East has K109. Then West leads the Jack. If North covers, North just eliminated the diamond guess for West.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Leading the Jack is a common ploy that some experts use against less experienced players in the hopes they will cover or at least hesitate. Please, remember my one cardinal rule of defense, "Play second hand low smoothly." That is the single most important rule in defense and it will gain you many more tricks than it loses. Nada, admit it, if Eddy played low smoothly, would you have let the Jack ride?|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


AT|
hope: I had to -had no 9 and ten.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^*B
-- ^*N|cp||at|: Which is why the Jack was the wrong play to start with. If Eddy had the Q10 or Q9 then covering would be right.|

isabable: We missed slam.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, you did. It is a hard hand to bid. The play was perfect and no discussion needed. 3C by Kerrie was not Bergen Raise. Bergen Raises is off after interference. It is a cue bid of my suit. It simply shows at least 10 dummy points, and heart support. The question is how many trumps does it show. |
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Many people play that they can make a cue bid of the overcalled suit with only 3 card support. But, I like to play it shows 4 card support. The reason I like it to show 4 card support is that a 9 card fit is much better than an 8 card fit. So, I want to know when we have a 9 card fit. However, then on hands where you have 3 card support and limit raise points, you might have to make an awkward call.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |

Dorothy1: And a passed hand is a little trickier.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes with a passed hand, it is trickier.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I play new suits by a passed hand are still forcing. But if they are not, then it is best, at least with a passed hand that you play the cue bid only promises 3.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, it turns out they are cold for six, due to their double fit in hearts and diamonds. Let's use Bergen Points to see if it makes sense to bid it. Kerrie has 11 Bergen Points--just her HCP. In fact, one could argue she should deduct a point for her 4-3-3-3 shape. East has 17 Starting Points: 16 HCP, two length points (one for each 5 card suit), one 1 for quality hearts, minus two for singleton King and Jx. Once Kerrie raises, East can then add 2 for the singleton and 1 for the side diamond suit. That gives her 20. Since Kerrie has at most 12, slam is a bit remote.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But, because Kerrie has the perfect cards, slam happens to make. Change any of her high cards to somewhere else (for example make the A of clubs the A of spades) and slam has no plays. I do not think slam should be bid. Further, you cannot bid slam unless you play a sophisticated bidding system with what are known as "asking bids."|

PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me count winners first. This hand is actually pretty easy once I get the diamond lead. If spades are 2-2 and hearts are 3-3 (or the Jack comes down). I take 5 spades in my hand 5 hearts, 2 diamonds for 12 tricks. I can pitch 3 clubs on the hearts and lose a cub or pitch a diamond on the hearts and lose a club. So, the best I can do with perfect breaks is six.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Again, notice I planned the hand out before playing. Six was easy on a diamond lead. Now, let us review the points for North hand. North has 15 Starting Points--13 HCP, 1 length points, and 1 point for the quality hearts suit. Once I bid 1S, she can add 3 for the singleton club. That gives her 18. She is not quite strong enough for a game force but 2S is an underbid. She should bid 3S, showing 17-19 dummy points. |
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand I am not sure I will look for slam. I have 13 HCP, 1 length point, 1 quality suit minus 1 for Qx of hearts for 14 Starting Points. Given she bid hearts I might decide not to deduct one for Qx of hearts. But, even after raising spades I have no extra declarer points. With 14-15 Bergen Points I barely am in slam range if partner has a good 18 or 19. Nevertheless, I might bid 4D, and if partner bids 4H, I might bid slam. At the very least, North should bid 3S not 2S. That gives us a shot at bidding this hard to bid slam.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For those not familiar with Puppet, it is a way for the 2N bidder to show both 4 and 5 card majors. If North has a 5 card major, she would bid it. With a 4 card major she bids 3D, just as she did.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is where it gets tricky. I want North to be declarer, as she has the strong hand. So, I know we want to play either 3N or 4H (if her suit is hearts). Therefore, I bid the major I don't have, in order to let North be declarer at either 4H or 3N. That way Nada will bid 4H with a 4-card heart suit and 3N with 4-spades. Either way, North ends up as declarer. BTW, all Puppet bids are alertable. For those who play Smolen it is sort of the same idea.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, we discussed Puppet. As to the play, the trick to this hand is to manage your entries. One technique we discussed is unblocking the heart suit immediately. The second excellent defensive technique was the clubs. At trick four Eddy carefully gave Kerrie count. So, Kerrie knew Eddy had 2 clubs and Nada had 3 clubs so she correctly ducked 2 clubs.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, I will do the best I can given I didn't see anything, lol. After 1D-1S North has two choices. 2S showing at least a limit raise is fine. The other alternative is 4H splinter, but that is probably too high. So, I like 2S best. Over 3S I like the 4C bid, that must be a control bid, as diamonds is the agreed upon suit. Over 4S, 5C is fine. I think 6D is a double dummy bid. Qian could easily have 2 heart losers. I think Gail should bid 6D over 4S. It is likely that Qian is very short in spades, and Gail knows she has the heart void. |

However, as I get older I become more persistent and keep writing on the sand--reviewing the material over and over. This week my sand writing deals with |CP||AT|Gambling 3NT|CP||AT| which is not exactly a barn burner but there were three boards during month of July mentoring sessions. The material in part is from ^*Hwww.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/Gambling3NoTrump.html^*N though there are many other good web sites. This is a brief discussion of the topic.

^B@2^*BMovie Maker' Warning: ^*N|cp||at|The following is a short comment by Howard after reviewing this section:

"I don't see anything wrong with the section per se, but I know of no one who plays it like that or who even knows about all those conventional bids.

Most people, at least that I know, who play Gambling 3N, play it as a solid 8 card suit, with no outside aces or kings. I, as you know, use a slightly less well defined method. I play it shows an 8 (or occasionally 9) trick hand with a solid minor. The minor can either be 7 or 8 cards long, but if it is 7 cards long, then you should have an outside A for your 8th trick.

As you also noted, I don't think it is a particularly useful convention, and if someone came up with a better use for opening 3N, I would play it a minute!"

^-{        Gambling Three No Trump         }
^-|HT|f|CP||FP|1|at|^B@2^Z@3"T|FP||AT|he Gambling Three No Trump Convention is used to obstruct the opponents because it takes up so much bidding space. This conventional method is part of the British System. This feature is also used by bridge players using Precision. The Gambling Three No Trump bid is also a feature of the Acol System and has been adopted by bridge players using the Two Clubs Strong Artificial Opening bid.|
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


AT|

"The Gambling Three No Trump bid is an opening bid based on a long, solid Minor suit, with at least one, preferably two, outside stoppers. The general consensus is that the Minor suit should contain at least seven cards, which are solid in honors from the top Ace down to generally the Jack. This guideline, however, has been relaxed to include holdings which contain only five Losing Tricks and a 7-card Minor suit. However, the requirement that an outside stopper should be included continues to be valid for both views. |
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


AT|

"Note: The so-called Classical Version of this concept requires that the opener have stoppers in two side suits in addition to the solid 7-card Minor suit. This version is sometimes referred to as the Strong Gambling 3 No Trump Opening.|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


AT|

"Note: The second version is referred to as the Modified Version, devised by Mr. Terence Reese. In this version the Minor suit is still the solid to semi-solid 7-card Minor suit with the difference being that only one outside King or Queen be present. This version is sometimes referred to as the Weak Gambling No Trump Opening. See also: Gambling 2 No Trump."|

Responder has the following options:|
pg| ***** 161 ***** |


MB|P|NT|^B@2
Pass is to play. |
PG| ***** 162 ***** |


ub||mb|4c|NT|^B@2
4C Shows weakness and indicates a desire to play in opener's long Minor suit. The opener either passes if the long minor suit was Clubs or corrects to 4D with South's hand.|
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


uB||mb|4d|NT|^B@2
4D is an artificial bid, asking for a singleton. 
1. If opener has a singleton in a Major suit, the opener bids that suit. A 4H rebid shows a singleton in Hearts and a 4S rebid shows a singleton in Spades. 
2. If opener bids 4NT, this shows a singleton in either of the Minor suits. 
3. If opener bids 5C or 5D, then opener has a singleton in other Minor suit and the bid establishes the long, solid Minor suit. |
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


ub||mb|4h|NT|^B@2
 4H  or 4S :  These two bids are natural and indicate a self-sufficient 6-card suit or better. The opener is required to pass. |
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


ub||mb|4N|NT|^B@2
4NT is a conventional bid. Opener has already shown an Ace, and therefore the responses are downgraded. 
5C : Promises 1 Ace 
5D : Promises 2 Aces 
5H : Promises 3 Aces |
PG| ***** 166 ***** |


ub||mb|5c|NT|^B@2 
5C bid shows a desire to play in the Minor suit of the opener. This can be a possible Preempt. |
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


ub||mb|5d|NT|^B@2
5D bid is natural. With a high honor in Clubs, the responder has reasoned that the suit of the opener is Diamonds. The opener should pass.|
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


ub||mb|5N|NT|^B@2
5NT is a forcing response asking opener to bid a grand slam if opener has additional values such as an 8-card Minor suit, or King/Queen in a side suit. |
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


ub||MB|6c|NT|^B@2
6C shows a desire to play a Minor suit slam. The opener can correct to Diamonds is Diamonds is the long, solid Minor suit. |
