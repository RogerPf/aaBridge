^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, let's talk about what club Eddy should lead. Granted from Q109 many people lead the 10. But, the 9 is not considered an honor so Eddy should lead low to show an honor, since 987 is not an honor sequence, and the 9 implies nothing higher. So, the @C7 is the best lead.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|
EddyHaskel: I thought 9 or ten showed one higher--coded--and 9 is top of a sequence as well.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us talk about coded 10s and 9s afterwards, as there is some slight confusion there. For now, let me give you an undo.   |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, the bidding was fine. It is very difficult for Kerrie to guess the K of hearts is singleton. But, let us discuss "coded 10s and 9s." First of all, they only apply in NT contracts, not suit contracts. So, in this contract, coded 9s do not apply. Secondly, let us take the lead of the 10 first.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If playing coded 10s, and you lead the 10, it means one of two things: (a) you have a sequence headed by the 10 with nothing higher (e.g. 1098x) or (b) you have a broken sequence with the J10 (e.g. AJ109x KJ108x). Some people say it shows "zero or two higher." That is correct but not a sufficient explanation.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, suppose you have the suit AQ10x. If you use the "2 higher" rule, you should lead the 10. However, that is not the correct lead. The "x" is the correct lead. So, coded 10s shows either none higher or (2) a broken sequence with the J10. In this fashion, if you play coded 10s, the lead of the J denies a higher honor--if partner leads the Jack, he has J109 or J108 and neither the Ace or the King. That is useful information. If he leads the 10, you can usually work out if he has zero or two higher, and what the higher one is.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Coded 9s work similarly. The lead of the 9 shows one of two things; (1)either nothing higher than the 9 (e.g. 98xx) or a broken sequence with the 10 (e.g. A109x K109x or Q109x). So, even if we were playing coded 9s, Eddy's suit is not suitable for a coded 9 lead.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


AT|
EddyHaskel: Are coded 9 or 10s led only from five or can they be led from four?|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You can lead from 4, but in that case I would make sure you have J109 or J108 or 1098 or 1097 in your suit.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to why they are not played in suits. Because you are less likely to make that lead in a suit. You would never lead away from an Ace, so that already eliminates 2 possibilities and you are less likely to lead away from KJ, K10, or Q10. So, there is not much point in playing them.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|^B@2
EddyHaskel: Why is 9 as top of interior sequence wrong?|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because then you cannot distinguish whether or not partner has a higher honor.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


AT|
esprit12: Are coded 10s & 9s leads only refer to opening lead?|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, they only apply to the opening lead. Once you are in the middle of the hand, the distribution of the cards is usually clearer.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


sc||UP|28|pf|Y|qx|B1,back|NT|^B@2
@D@D nome: Now, if you wish, you can play this hand double dummy. The opening lead was club seven , you can choose a different lead. Just click any card from that hand. When finished or if not interested in the double dummy feature please, click the forward arrow to move to the next board.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most people lead the Ace here (same as from AK on opening lead), but that is not correct in the middle of the hand. Here Eddy should lead the King. When it wins, I know he has the Ace. In the middle of the hand, the K from AK is correct. In fact, in the old days, people played K from AK even on opening lead.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|An interesting hand to bid here. First of all, what should Eddy do over 2H? 3D is certainly a reasonable alternative but, I personally would double.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


AT|
EddyHaskel: I get yelled at when I double with 5-card suit :).|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Only if you have 5-card major, not 5-card minor. If you get yelled at for having 5-card minor, then yell back :).|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, if Eddy doubles, and I bid clubs then he would bid 3N with Eddy's hand. So, I think double is slightly better than 3D because it is more flexible. Alternatively, Eddy could double and bid 3D--double and correct. For that bid, he should have a six card suit, but his 5-card suit is pretty good, and sometimes after a preempt you are stuck and not clear what to do.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to what hope should do. By the Law of total tricks she should pass. And, in fact, the way the hand works out, pass would work out fine. I don't hate 3H at this vulnerability as that is down 1, and we make 3D or 3S but 4H is out of the question. It has too many downsides. She can get doubled and go down too many. Further, she can push us into a game that we were not going to bid. So, unless 4H makes, there is no real upside. Again, if you follow the Law of total tricks, as Bergen says "The Law is smarter than all bridge players."|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have found that to be true for the most part, (pardon me Mike Lawrence). The reason I said that is Mike Lawrence wrote a book titled something like "I broke the Law and lived" :). But, I think he is wrong.|

PG| ***** 60 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No way. With 12-14 he would bid a new suit. 2N bid shows invitation to 3N--usually 16 or 17. You can never bid 2N over a forcing NT with 12-14. On the other hand, Eddy had a problem over 1N. We will discuss his options afterwards.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nice play by Nada. First, let's talk about what 2N over 1N should mean. Some kibs felt it should show 18 or 19 because pard could have as little as 5 or 6. But, if you are an optimist, pard could have as much as 11. So, I like to play it shows 16 or 17, or even 15 with a good suit. Now, of course, the question is, why wasn't the hand opened 1N with a balanced 15-17. The answer is, perhaps slightly unsuitable distribution, such as this hand.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What should Eddy bid over 1N?|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


AT|  I think 2S is somewhat of an underbid. 3S is possible. He has the right point count, and six spades. But, Eddy is right, his spades are a tad weak to bid 3S. So, I kind of like 2N, because it shows that he has high cards in all suits. The risk Eddy takes is that 4S might be missed if pard has 2 low spades and 3N does not make. So, those of you who choose 3S with Eddy's hand have a good argument. However, I think 2N has some merit as well.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The preempt again gave us problems. Kerrie should double and bid NT unless I bid spades. That shows 19+ which is what she has. So, double is the best bid, followed by 3N over 3D. 2N directly over 2D is 15-18. Here, 6S is our best spot probably, but hard to get to.|

^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|Howard coached the players how to bid this hand. So, I am presenting it in a closed and quiz format. I have Howard's critique after each bid except for the first two bids which are straightforward. In some instances there were several undoes before the players made the correct bid suggested by Howard. I thought the discussions were instructive. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Don has 18 Starting Points--16 HCP, 3 length points, and less 1 for singleton @HK. Not quite good enough for a jump shift, but certainly close, and I would not hate a 2S bid but, 1S by Don is acceptable.

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Right, you have no idea how strong Don is, other than less than a jump shift. But, your hand is an opener based on Rule of 20 (11 HCP + four hearts and five clubs). So, I think your original 2C game force bid is ok, but a tad aggressive and your second choice of 2D is too weak. I would probably choose 2N.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you had a 4th diamond, 3D invitational is another possibility. The problem with 2D with your hand is it tends to show a weak hand. You could have six points with that bid. I would choose either 2C or 2N. 2N shows 11 HCP or so, which is what you have.|

PG| ***** 110 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Unfortunately, 2C is not an option because you two do not play Fourth Suit Forcing--4SF. If you did then 2C bid followed by 3D is a game force. BTW, 4SF is a really good convention. Regardless, 2N is a perfectly good bid with your hand.|

However, as I get older I become more persistent and keep writing on the sand--reviewing the material over and over.

HT|H|cp|5|FP||AT|
^c@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once the Blackwood bidder receives a response to 4N, he may then bid 5N as a king ask. There are two variations to the K response. The variation I have a preference for is to respond with the number of kings (obviously not counting the K of trumps).|
PG| ***** 171 ***** |


AT|

- 6@C = 0 kings, 
- 6@D = 1 king, 
- 6@H = 2 kings, 
- 6@S = 3 kings. |
PG| ***** 172 ***** |


AT|

The other variation is "specific kings". If you play that, then you respond with the cheapest suit in which you have an outside K; if you do not have an outside K, you bid six in the agreed upon trump suit. |
PG| ***** 173 ***** |


AT|

The main complication playing specific kings is if your specific king is in a suit higher than the agreed upon trump suit. I play that you should respond with your specific king even in that case (partner needs to be prepared for that response), but some people play you can only respond with a specific king if it is in a suit lower than your agreed upon trump suit.|
PG| ***** 174 ***** |


AT|

Also, most people play that if the Blackwood bidder bids 5N as a king ask, that guarantees your side has all 5 key cards. That allows the responder, on rare occasions, to bid seven if he has a hand with an undisclosed feature that will most likely allow seven to make (such as a long solid side suit, which will generate many tricks).|
