^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

hope: I goofed with trumps.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Actually no you did not hope. You were just unlucky. Before we get to the bidding, two very important principles on defense. When playing third hand high, always play the lowest in your honor sequence. It tells partner important information. When Kerrie plays the Ace I have no idea who has the King or Queen. But when she plays the Queen and it wins, I know she has the Ace and King. That it is why it is crucial to play the lowest in your sequence as third hand.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The second important principle, even more important, is always take the setting  trick! Particularly in IMP.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let's discuss Hope's trump play. She made the correct play. Had she more entries, she can afford to cash the A or K first, but she doesn't. But given I preempted, it is much more likely hearts are split 3-1 with Kerrie having 3. So, her play is the correct one even though it happened to fail here. It will be right most of the time. You can't worry about a play that fails if it is the right play. In the long run you will come out way ahead.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let's talk about the auction. Everything was fine through 3H. Hope should seriously consider 4H with her hand. You should tend to value shortness in the opponents suit. Eddy has about the worst hand he could have, and 4H still had plays given I led a diamond. On the other hand, Eddy has a clear pass. He has a spade trick, and not a particularly good hand for his 3H bid. If partner can't bid 3, there is no reason to think he should bid 4 either. He has nothing more than he said the first time, and the King of spades is probably better on defense than offense. So, even "bid early bid often" Howard would have passed with the West hand over 3S :).|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, Kerrie's 3S bid was excellent. Perfect law of total tricks bid.  |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's talk a bit about the bidding. Some people play gambling 3N with Hope's hand. Had Hope had one more diamond, she has a gambling 3N bid. A gambling 3N shows an 8-card solid minor. Some people play it shows nothing outside and seven-card solid minor, but, as usual, I am not that disciplined. If you are going to gamble, then gamble, otherwise don't play it, lol. A gambling 3N tends to show a solid minor worth 8 tricks. Some people do it with a solid 7 card minor and an outside Ace, but most do not. Basically, your hope is since you have 8 tricks partner has 1, and they can't run 5 tricks.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, should Hope bid 3D over 1H? It's close. She has a six loser hand and a singleton in partner's suit. I would probably have reluctantly bid 2D, but 3 is certainly conceivable. Using Bergen's Starting Points she has 14 HCP + 3 length - 2 for dubious shortness, which gives her 15. If you use the Bergen point count, you need 17 to jump to 3, so she is short. That combined with her losing trick count of six, and shortness in hearts, says 2 is probably more prudent. |
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, given she bid 3, Eddy has a clear 3N bid. He has all the suits stopped, and 10 HCP. In fact, if diamonds were 3-3 or the Jack dropped, 3N makes easily. It still has plays even with a 4-2 diamond break.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, the bidding was fine. Hope is close to a 3N bid. She has 9 HCP and a point for length. But if you use Bergen adjusted HCP you need 26 at least for game. Since Kerrie could have 15 or a bad 16, it is still worth only a 2N bid. If her club suit was better, say KQ instead of K10, then she has a better case. But with only one high honor, I think 2N is more prudent.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, one  important point. Kerrie and Hope play 4 way transfers usually and 2N in this case is supposed to be a transfer to diamonds. This is a good illustration of why I recommend against playing 4 way transfers, because it is real easy to forget. Having said that, given they play 4 way transfers Hope has to bid 2C followed by 2N to invite with her hand. That is how you do an invitational 2N playing 4 way transfers. Therefore, 2C does not guarantee a 4 card major if you play 4 way transfer.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, if Eddy wants to get frisky, he could bid 2H--DONT. Given the vul and his excellent distribution, it would be an interesting bid. But, it is definitely frisky, and I  would not even consider it except at this vulnerability. I like modified DONT much better. Let me review modified DONT quickly.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In modified DONT, 2H bid, rather than showing hearts and spades, just shows hearts. The reason I like it better is that there are more single suited major hands than 2 suited major hands. So, you preempt the opponents more often when you have a single suited heart hand. To show hearts and spades in modified DONT, you double and then bid hearts over the forced 2C bid. Therefore, double in modified DONT either shows a single suited minor or both majors.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Excellent Kerrie :). Since Kerrie did a squeeze, lets talk about the technique. She has 11 sure tricks 5 hearts 3 clubs 2 spades and a diamond. To squeeze for a 12th trick she has to lose her tricks early. In this case, since she is trying for 12 tricks she must lose one trick. And since she has to lose the Ace of hearts, losing one trick is easy. Her most likely squeeze is in clubs and diamonds. If one person has both the King and Queen of diamonds plus 4 clubs, then it works. |
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, all Kerrie needs to do is keep track of clubs. She just runs her tricks and watches for any club discards. She knows there are six out against her, so as long as she keeps track of how many are played, she knows if the squeeze worked or not. Squeezes do not require a huge amount of brain power. Usually you only need to keep track of one, or at most two, suits.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If the opponents bid a gambling 3N, that is a rare time when an unprotected Ace is a good lead because then you get to look at dummy and see if there should be a switch. For example if we were playing 3NT, say Eddy led the Ace of hearts and Kerrie would discourage. Eddy sees the Ace of spades in dummy and knows if he leads a spade they have 9 tricks. Therefore, he plays a diamond and hopes they beat it. That is the only auction I can think of where an unprotected Ace is the recommended lead.|

PG| ***** 92 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You could open 5C Hope, but I suspect Kerrie still bids 5D. However, since gambling 3N comes up twice a year, I wouldn't worry too much about it though. 1C was certainly an option. It is really a matter of tactics more than anything else. What is the best way to describe your hand and make it hard for the opponents. The problem, tactically, with opening 1C is, because you have a long suit, they probably have a long suit too. So, the auction can get out of hand, particularly at unfavorable vulnerability. |
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Suppose it goes, for example, 1C-3S-P. Now, I have a tough time to bid. On the other hand, when you open 3N, at least I have some idea of what you have and can bid more intelligently. Last night, I opened 3N (first time in a year) and my partner had AKQx AKQx xxxx x. He bid 6N, they didn't find the diamond lead and I made 7. This was Match Points, so a certain amount of gambling is allowed.|

EddyHaskel: Do you only open gambling 3N with minor solid 8 card suits?  With major do you open 4H or 4S? Or 1h or 1s and then keep bidding them?|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, let's discuss the play here. Terry needed to form a plan. He can count 3 heart tricks most likely, and 1 club and he is likely to get 3 spades if he goes after spades right away, maybe even 4. So, as he did, he plays a spade at trick 3. I think Linda should take the Ace. The reason being, Terry should not have 3 spades, since he did not raise spades. Therefore Anna has Jxx or jxxx. In any case, ducking the Ace costs a trick in many cases. But once Linda ducks, Terry should continue his plan.|
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|He should assume Anna has the Ace, and lead a spade planning on finessing East for the Jack. When East shows up with the Ace, the contract is cold. So, by coming up with a plan, Terry can easily make the hand. Planning is the most important part of declarer play. Don't just randomly play suits. Figure out which suits you need to play to take the number of tricks you need to make. Playing the hand is not about figuring out how to play each suit per se. It is about figuring out how to take the number of tricks you need to take.|

However, as I get older I become more persistent and keep writing on the sand--reviewing the material over and over. The following is one of my many errors at BBO where I had to ask Howard for help. The play afterward is just confirmation of his opinion.

Howard,I thought the 2NT after an overcall does not reflect 18-19 points and I passed. Is a 2NT bid the same as if there were no interference?|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although it occurs rarely, 2N has the same meaning with or without the 1S overcall. One other good rule of thumb. If you are not sure what a bid means, assume the strongest reasonable meaning and bid accordingly. So, on this hand, if not sure, you should have still assumed the 2N was 18-19, just in case. |
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, if you are not sure if a bid is forcing or not, assume it is forcing. It will work out more often than not (even when the bid was not meant to be forcing). 3N should make on the hand as long as you attack diamonds. You should take 3 diamonds, 3 clubs, and can easily come to at least 3 tricks in the majors.|

at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N
