{      Beginner Intermediate Lounge, Our Home      }
^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, first the bidding. I like Hope's 2D bid. There is a good chance of a diamond slam and that is a good way to start exploring. However, once Eddy  bids 2N, they can expect bad breaks, so Hope is content to play 3N. Over 2N, Kerrie has a couple of choices. I don't like 3D. I like either double, which suggests that she might want to penalize us or she could pass, and see what happens. It turns out I bid 3C, which Hope doubles, and we are in big trouble.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3D suggests Kerrie has an offensive hand with long diamonds and little defense against clubs and hearts and that is not what she has. So, I think pass or double is best. 3N was fine by hope, but we need to discuss the play. Hope can likely count three heart tricks if she plays the Jack because even if I have the Queen (unlikely based on the auction) she then can finesse the 9 from Eddy.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, she has three hearts, three spades, two clubs, and a diamond at least. Therefore, she should definitely play the Jack of hearts and she definitely should not duck the heart, as she turned three heart tricks into two. The only trick in the hand is the entry problems. Hope has to unblock her spades and hearts. |
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once the Jack of hearts wins, she should play AK of spades, and A of hearts. Then she can play a diamond to the board, play her winning Queen of spades and King of hearts, and take her 2 club tricks for 9 tricks. The way she played it, if Eddy  figures out how to discard, she only takes 8 tricks. The trick on this hand is to count out your tricks at trick one, and play the cards in the right order to ensure 9 tricks. It is tricky but not difficult if you plan correctly and make sure you unblock.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Did you discover some extra points in your hand Kerrie?  Hope is bidding pretty weakly. She did not raise to 2H right away so she probably only has two card support. She did not jump so she probably doesn't have a particularly good hand. The problem was your 2D bid. Granted, you are not quite strong enough to bid 3D but your best rebid would have been 2S. That would be the best way to get to game if you had it. 3H is ok with your hand. I will discuss raising responder's major with 3 card support afterwards.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The play was ok, but we can discuss the bidding. When partner responds one of a major to a one of a minor opener it is often right to raise with 3 card support particularly when responder bids spades. Raising partner's major tends to show four, but it only promises three, assuming the hand is appropriate. You should raise a 1S response to 2S with  three card support, if you have three to a top honor, and shortness somewhere. |
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also, Kerrie has an awkward hand point wise. She is too weak to jump shift, she only has three spades, and a jump to 3S shows four card support. If she had another spade instead of say a diamond, then 3S would have been a good bid. But since she only has three card support, she can only bid 2S. However, if Hope has 5 and more than a min, that is encouraging. Basically, you should raise responder's 1 of a major to 2 with three card support, when you have shortness somewhere and three to an honor.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now it turns out Kerrie can also save the auction another way. Once she bids 2D, and Hope bids 2H, Kerrie can bid 2S. That shows exactly 3-5-4-1 distribution and Hope can bid accordingly, passing in this case. But remember, 2D is not forcing so responder, with 5 spades, will often pass 2D when you really want to play in spades which is why 2S is better than 2D initially.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss why Kerrie's 4H bid was excellent. Using Bergen count she has 19 Starting Points: 17 HCP, 1 length, and 1 quality suit. Once Eddy raises she can add 2 for the singleton and 1 for the 4 card side diamond suit. That gets her to 22 Bergen Points. Eddy should have six (or at least 5) to raise. So, partnership has at least 26 combined points and 4H is clear. |
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, once the diamonds work, there is a simple way to try for an extra trick. At trick eight simply duck a club. If clubs are 3-3 you get an extra club trick. If clubs are not 3-3, you can then try for 3-3 diamonds. Therefore, there was no real fancy elimination play needed. Just simply play for one of the minors to break 3-3. In general you don't need fancy plays on most hands. Just play for suits to break normally and make sure you maximize your chances. Larry Cohen, who is one of the best US players said he rarely does end plays and squeezes. He mostly just tries to come up with several alternatives on each hand and hopes one of them works.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played. We were in a good spot, and Hope played it correctly. But it took a little luck in clubs. However, Kerrie made a nice club shift. A couple of kibs asked if Hope had opening points and it turns out she does not. She has 19 points: 12 HCP + 7 in 2 longest suits. So, the hand is not an opener using rule of 20. However, as a "bid early bid often" advocate, I cannot argue too much :). Now, given she opened, let me discuss my treatment of 1D over 1C. |
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Many people play you always bypass diamonds when you have a 4 card major and that is a perfectly good way to play. However, I use a slightly more complicated rule, which you can choose to play or not. I will only bypass diamonds if my hand is worth one bid. Thus, with a weak hand I will bid my major rather than 1D. On the other hand, with a stronger hand I will bid 1D and see what develops. That lets me describe my hand and gives me more options later in the auction. I can always bid my major later, and make another forcing bid. You just need to choose what makes sense for you.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, based on your counting the spades, it is why playing the Ace is right because you know the King is coming down. Otherwise it disappears on the King of diamonds. You should make an effort to count out at least the suits you can easily do so based on the auction or play.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, mostly I want to discuss the auction because it is important to know how to bid after a takeout double. The most important bid is to redouble when you have 10 HCP. So, Hope should redouble for sure. By passing she is denying 10 HCP. If you have 10 points you usually redouble. Many also play Jordan 2N, where a 2N bid over the double shows a limit raise or better. In any case you may not pass over a takeout double with 10 or more points.|

@D@D nome: Now, if you wish, you can play this hand double dummy. Lead was diamond four, however, you can choose a different lead. Just click any card from that hand. When finished or if not interested in the double dummy feature please, click the forward arrow to move to the next board. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very nice Kristy. First of all, why didn't I make a negative double. Because I have such good hearts and a very good hand. So, 3H was clear. Now, what should Kristy do over 3H? She has enough points that we should be in game and I think 4S is warranted. Even opposite a singleton, her suit is good enough. It is very unlucky she got a 5-1 break. In fact, most of the time the suit plays ok over a void. So, since she knows we have game, and spades is likely to be a good suit, 4S is a good bid. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One more comment. East should consider bidding 4D right away rather than 3. If willing to bid 4 over 3 of a major, then bid 4 right away. It is much more effective to bid 4D right away than bid 3D followed by 4D. It takes up more room, makes it harder to communicate. So, when you preempt, decide how high you are willing to go, and do it right away. That is the most effective way. Had East bid 4D I probably still bid 4H, and North still bids 4S. However, many hands it will work out well to bid 4D.|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play which is very unclear. If spades break 4-2, once East shifts to a club, there are 11 tricks on the hand. Therefore, I like starting to draw trumps. However, once spades don't break it is not clear what to do. I think the best play is to draw 4 rounds, and play a heart and hope West has the heart Ace. West certainly should not have any more diamonds based on the auction. It is important, remember, to take clues from the bidding and since East has AK of diamonds and preempted, probably doesn't have A of hearts. |
