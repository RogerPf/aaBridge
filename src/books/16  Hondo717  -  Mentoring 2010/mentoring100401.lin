^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My guidelines for playing a 9 card suit missing the Queen are as follows. With no information, I play for a 2-2 break, which is just a percent or two better than finessing. However, if one person has shown a long suit, even a 5 card suit, I play the other person for the Queen if possible. So, in this case, since Patti preempted in  hearts, and I know she has 8, I am playing Sandy for the Queen.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, we discussed the play. The other thing to discuss is my opening bid. Some people would open 2C, and I would not object. But let me give you my guidelines, plus some general thoughts. First of all, there is the Marty Bergen 4 and 4 rule you can use, when you have a major suit. That rule says if you have 4 quick tricks and 4 "Marty Bergen" losers, then you should open 2C if your suit is a major. "Marty Bergen" losers are different than losing trick count.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In Losing trick Count which is a popular hand evaluation method (LTC), my club suit is 2 losers. In "Marty Bergen" losers, it is how many tricks I am likely to lose opposite a singleton. So, my club suit is probably 3 losers at least. And besides, I don't have a major suit.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


AT|

nome: I have difficulty to understand why with Bergen method you have three losers. Your Ace clear cannot lose unless it is ruffed.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you use "Losing Trick Count" (the method popularized by Ron Klinger), you indeed have two losers. However, Marty Bergen does not use Losing Trick Count in formulating his "4 Quick Tricks/4 Losers" rule for opening 2C. He actually figures out how many losers you are likely to have in a suit. For example, AKJ10 is clearly one loser, whereas AKxx is two losers. With AJ6542 opposite a singleton, assuming the likely 4-2 break, you are likely to lose 3 tricks in the suit (not counting ruffing, Marty is looking at losers in a no trump context). |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The easiest way to visualize this is to imagine you cash the ace and play low. If clubs are 4-2, you will lose the K, Q, and 10, for example. So, using Marty Bergen's methods, that is a 3 loser suit.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


AT|

nome: Thank you for the explanation.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I use a slightly different guideline. My guideline for opening 2C is if I think I have a reasonable shot at 9 tricks in my hand. So, on this hand I have 3 red tricks. In spades I have maybe 1.5 tricks. That is 4.5. In clubs I have around 4 tricks, opposite a singleton by partner. So, I am probably just short of a 2C opener. If you move a small spade to the club suit then I will open 2C. Also, on border line hands, if my suit is a minor, I tend to be less likely to open 2C, since 5 of a minor is harder to make than 4 of a major. So, I was satisfied opening 1C on this hand.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, lets discuss the bidding first. Generally if you have an invitational hand with both majors, over a takeout double it is better if you bid the best suit. Sandy, still, was a bit unlucky that Patti only had 3 hearts. She could just as easily had 3 spades. However, AQxxx spades opposite Jxx of spades is much easier to play than Kxxx of hearts opposite Jxx. So, that is why 2S is a slightly better bid.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, you should probably ignore spades, try for a club ruff. A low spade at trick 2 is ok, then play a club. I think you make or go down 1 at worst. At trick two and then trick three nice signaling by dee in spades.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With 4 or more spades, Patti is supposed to bid Jacoby 2N or splinter. Second it shows a strongish hand, based on the principle of "fast arrival." Fast arrival says, once a game force is established, the faster you get to game, the worse your hand is. The idea is with a better hand you want to go slowly. With minimum hand, you just want to bid game, as slam is less likely. So, Patti assuming you even have a 2 over 1 bid, you have a clear 4S bid with your hand, as it is a minimum.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A couple of other comments on the bidding. I didn't think Patti is quite strong enough for a game force. My basic rule is, on borderline hands, if they don't meet the rule of 20, I don't consider them a game force. However, let us count Patti 's dummy points, perhaps she is right.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


AT|
11 HCP + 1 length point + 1 doubleton = 13 dummy points. Then, I guess 2D is quite reasonable, I stand corrected. |
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me comment on my bid. In the old days, traditionalist opened hands with 5 clubs and 5 spades, one club. The idea being you could open 1C and bid spades twice to show your distribution at a lower level. But, these days, the suggested opener is 1S with 5 spades and 5 clubs.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |

dee_dee_20: Can North respond 1NT and then jump in @s ?|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, if she chooses to treat her hand as a limit raise with 3 card support. However, as Patti correctly pointed out, her hand count comes to 13 dummy points if you use Bergen counting method, so 2D is acceptable. As you know, 10-12 is a limit raise. It sort of feels like a limit raise to me, but it counts out to a strong raise.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, it turns out there is a convention known as a responsive double, which I could have used. If we were playing responsive doubles, a double by me over 1S shows the other 2 suits and asks Patti to pick. And for that bid you can have as few as six points. However, we are not playing responsive doubles and it is not my favorite convention. However, it happens to work on this hand.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No actually it proves you are normal, I hate to say, lol.  Anyhow, the best way to play this hand is to set up dummy's spades for heart pitches. But for some reason, most bridge players find it hard to set up dummy. So, I would just ruff the diamond and play spades and then draw 2 rounds of trump and pitch 2 hearts on the spades. But I guarantee that is easier to see if east had been dummy.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Patti now has several bids. Most people play 3H is the weakest bid. Pass is sort of, I have an okay hand, slightly better than average, and redouble is I have a real good hand with lots of points. 4H is more distributional. So, 3H is her bid here. That is the weakest bid Patti can make.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, let us discuss a couple of the bidding aspects. First, should Patti open? Again, if you use traditional methods, it does not meet the rule of 20. But if you use Bergen's methods, she has 11 HCP, 1 length + 1 quality suit, enough to open. So, Marty Bergen, Mr. "Rule of 20" would approve of Patti 's opening bid. |
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next, let us discuss dee's cue bid. Many people play that you can cue bid with either 3 or 4 card support. I personally like it to show 4 card support. I think the difference between an 8 and 9 card fit is huge. So, I would bid 2D with dee's hand, but many would bid 3C. It is just a matter of whether a cue bid guarantees four-card support or three. Some people play a "mixed raise" convention. Where 2N shows 3 card support, 3C shows 4 card support.|
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now to Sandy's double. It is a "stolen bid" double, saying she would have bid 3C if dee had not bid. However,  with Kx of clubs, I think perhaps pass was better, but on the other hand at least it showed me a club card. I would not bid 3C with Sandy's hand over a pass by dee. And finally the contract was good on one of the two finesses. Therefore, once again proving that Bergen hand evaluation works well.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, let me discuss why Sandy's bid is not a preempt. There is no point in preempting in the pass out seat. So, with a Weak-2, Sandy just would bid 1H as a balance. 2H shows the hand she had. An opening hand like on this hand with good six card suit which allows us to get to thin games.|

However, as I get older I become more persistent and keep writing on the sand--reviewing the material over and over. Today's topic is "Bad Leads" which I have lined up below in their BAAADNESS order. |

at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N
