{      Beginner Intermediate Lounge, Our Home      }
^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nicely played Eddy. First of all why did I open 1C instead of 1D? Many would open 1D and that would not be wrong. But, I intend to bid 1N over a major suit bid, and I felt 1C gave me more flexibility in the auction. With a balanced hand and 4-4 in the minors I tend to open 1C, with unbalanced I open 1D. However, if you always want to open 1D with 4-4 in the minors that is fine and probably more mainstream. 1S and 1N were fine.|

It is unlikely we have great hearts, as we never bid them. So, the HQ singleton is not a big worry and if she passes that's where they play.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Remember, once you determine you don't have game points, your goal is to stay as low as possible in a reasonable strain. 1N seems like a reasonable strain. You should not worry too much about singletons in unbid suits. If the opponents didn't bid them, it is likely partner has something in that suit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My choice is 2D. Double and correct would be fine. My hand is certainly strong enough. But, I thought I would be more conservative and start with 2D, if I double and partner jumps to 3S, I could be in trouble.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's talk about the auction. Some people do like to open light in third seat, so, if you play that way, Nada can bid 1C. She has a good suit and doesn't mind it being led. So, she has a reason to open 1C. I personally like to use rule of 20 for all 4 seats. That way, even in 3rd seat, I have some idea of the values partner has, and will not be afraid to bid thin games. Therefore, my style is rule of 20 in all 4 seats, but there are arguments to be made for opening light in third seat.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In particular, if you play Drury and open 1 of a major, that helps a lot. But even then, if the opponents interfere, responder is sometimes unsure of how high to bid. You have to pick your poison. Decide whether or not you like to open light and agree with pard.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Double by Eddy was fine, as was 2H. 2H shows close to an opener, with 4 or possibly 5 hearts. Eddy now knows that game is possible. 4H is certainly the most straight forward call, hoping Kerrie has 5 hearts or a good 4-card suit. Another possibility is 3C asking Kerrie to bid 3N with a club stopper. But, if he does that, it turns out 3N goes down, losing 4 clubs and a diamond. So, 4H worked better on this hand, and, as we discussed, 4H should make.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, a couple of things about this hand. Over 1S, Eddy could bid 1N, but he is definitely marginal at best. So, pass is ok  and I have a clear pass. Now, there is a cardinal rule in balancing seat. If the opponents open 1 of a major and it goes P-P you are just about required to balance. The only exception is if you have a bad hand (< 10) and length in their suit. Since Kerrie is short in spades, she has to balance. If she bids 2D, things work out great for her side, as they have a 9 card diamond fit. |
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Don't be afraid to balance. Remember, assuming you are playing against competent opponents, your side has to have close to half the deck. Partner could not bid for some reason, but has values.|

A kib: Won't Nada bid 2 hearts then?|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, Nada will bid 2H and Eddy will bid 3D and I might bid 3H or 3S but at least we are now at the 3 level, not 1 level.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to the play. Nada had the right idea about not drawing trumps too early, but she can make a trick or 2 more. Instead of even starting with clubs, she should keep control of all suits and just start with hearts right away. She ends up losing 2 hearts, 1 spade, and 1 diamond for sure. Once you knock out the hearts, you can draw trumps. You might lose another spade, on a heart ruff, but you will always make at least 2 and 3 much of the time.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, this is an interesting hand to play. With a 2-2 spade break or singleton honor, I take 5 spades, 2 diamonds and a club for sure. I also have a chance at a long club or possibly a heart. I think I will try the double finesse in spades as that leaves some flexibility as to what to do.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good news and bad news as they say. The finesse worked, but it looks like there are 2 spade losers. The double finesse is always a reasonable play. It only fails if KQ doubleton are off side. However, cashing the Ace is almost as good. It kind of depends on the entry situation. If you can get back and forth easily, the double finesse is probably slightly better. I will try the hearts next. Heart being onside is more likely than 3-3 clubs. But, I have to cash the diamond Ace as I am on dummy for the last time.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand both clubs and hearts worked. But, in general, a finesse is much better odds than a 3-3 break (50% vs. 35%). As long as I play the hand correctly, it always makes against any defense.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let me discuss the bidding. I would have opened hope's hand perhaps. Further, after it goes 1S-P-2S, I would have considered a 3H bid, if for no other reason than lead directing. Bergen has a set of "OBAR" principles. "OBAR" stands for "Over Opponents' Bid and Raise." He recommends "pre-balancing." If you are short in the opponents suit, and have something reasonable to say, he recommends you say it. In this case, 3H qualifies as something reasonably to say. |

A Kib: Bidding question/comment. I know there are many versions of J2NT and responses....but doesn't the most common (basic?) recommend bidding a 2nd "strong" 5 card suit at the 4 level. So, 4H would be bid rather than 3C? or, is it not your preferred method?|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, that is not my style. Actually, according to Bergen, the correct response to J2N by East is 4 hearts. That shows a "strong" 5 card suit ("strong" being defined as at least 2 of the top 3 honors) and no more than 14 HCP. However, at the time, it did not even occur to me (but it should have).|
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most teachers say you should jump to the 4 level with any hand with an outside 5-card suit. But Bergen, with his usual wisdom, restricts the jump to what I said. Having said all that, Bergen would agree that 4H is a good response with the East hand.  On the other hand, if it had occurred to me it would have made it much more difficult for them to find slam. The most likely auction to get to slam would be 1S-2N-4H-5D-5H-6S. But, at the table very few people would bid it that way. |
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reasoning for the auction works thusly. West is sure East has a singleton or void somewhere (since East is 5-5 in the majors, mathematically she must have a singleton or void). 5D says West has the diamond Ace but is worried about clubs. East, with a club singleton, can bid 5H, which shows the heart Ace and a club control. (without club control East must bid 5S, because she knows that they have 2 club losers, East having denied a club control). Once East shows the club control, West has an easy 6S bid. |
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If West instead chooses to bid 4N instead of 5D, and East shows one key card, then West is on a guess. If East's shortness is in clubs, then six will make. But if East's shortness is in diamonds, they have 2 losers in clubs (or 3 on a bad day). So West has to flip a coin as to whether or not to bid six.|

So, needs 2 ruffs in dummy to make 12 tricks. Therefore, declarer must ruff 2 hearts before playing 3 rounds of trump. Entries are a bit of a problem as well. Bonnie basically did the right thing. There are just a few subtle things that make it easier to play.|

So, the only subtlety was keeping the three of spades as an entry to her hand and only an expert would notice that. So, in general the hand was played well.|

^-{^*BIntroduction to Constructive Bidding^*N} 

In this lesson, we will learn the basic principles of bidding, regardless of whatever conventions or treatments you play.
If you understand these principles, you will become a very good bidder, even if you play a very simple bidding system.
In fact, most very good money bridge players use a very natural style of bidding,
following these principles and using very few, if any, conventions. 
As one rubber bridge player once remarked to me after I watched him demolish
a pretty good duplicate bridge partnership using his very simple bidding style, 
"Match points (tournament bridge) is an interesting game, but it bears little resemblance to bridge".|

2. Find a good strain (trump suit or NT).|

The following table summarizes how the partnership can tell whether or not they have enough points to bid game:

Minimum               No           No           Yes

During the auction, both partners should always be thinking about whether it is still possible to bid game. For example, if your partner opens and you, as responder, have a maximum (12+) hand, you should bid game. Similarly, if you open with a maximum (18+ with traditional count and 20+ with Bergen's count) and get any response from partner, you should bid game. |

{The Captain}

(We men, in particular, should pay special attention to this section because we will find it emotionally difficult to follow 
these principles!) Although the bidding is a cooperative effort, one of the partners is considered the 
"Captain" of the hand. The other partner is considered the subordinate (men, substitute "peon" or even "slave" so 
you get the point).|
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


AT|

The Captain is in charge of deciding the final contract. This is accomplished by asking the subordinate to further describe
his/her hand and, perhaps, giving a choice of contracts. The subordinate simply answers the Captain's questions. 
This next sentence is very important. 
|CP|8|AT|On almost all hands, THE RESPONDER IS THE CAPTAIN OF THE HAND.|CP||AT| So (men), once you open the hand, you are 
relegated to being the subordinate. Similarly (ladies), you as responder are the Captain and in charge of the auction.|CS|2|
PG| ***** 171 ***** |


AT|

{The Captain's Tools}

The main difficulty for the Captain is to communicate to the subordinate when to keep bidding and when to stop. The
main tool to accomplish this is the "New-Suit-Forcing" principle. If the responder bids a new suit, the opener is obligated to 
make another bid. Opener, if your partner introduces a new suit,|CP|8|AT| YOU MAY NOT PASS.|CP||
PG| ***** 172 ***** |


AT| 

{Some advanced partnerships even play a convention called "Fourth Suit Forcing." If 3 suits have been bid, 
and responder bids the fourth suit, which may be artificial, the partnership is committed to bid game}.|
PG| ***** 173 ***** |


AT|

The other forcing bid is for responder to jump (e.g. 1@H-1@S-2@C-3@S). This should be avoided, if possible, in favor of 
New Suit forcing, which leaves more room for further bidding.
In fact, in those partnerships that play the Fourth Suit Forcing convention, a jump by responder is not forcing.|
pg| ***** 174 ***** |


CS|2|AT|

{The Subordinate's Tools}

The subordinate is responsible for describing both the strength (e.g. minimum, medium, maximum) and suits in his/her hand.
In this lesson, we will concentrate on how to describe strength.|
PG| ***** 175 ***** |


NT||
qx||FP|2|AT|
^-
|CP|8|AT|Minimum |CP||AT|hands are described by making the cheapest bid possible in the strain
opener wishes to bid. For example in the following auctions opener describes a minimum hand.

HT|o|FP|2|AT|^-
|CP|8|AT|Medium |CP||AT|hands are a bit harder to describe. Fortunately, many medium
hands are opened 1NT. Another method is to jump in the opening suit. For example:

PG| ***** 180 ***** |


NT||qx||FP|2|at|^-
|CP|8|AT|Maximum |CP||AT|hands are described by jump shifting, 
bidding one level higher than necessary in a new suit. For example in the following auctions:^-
|HT|c|cs|2|AT|{|ia|o1h1s3c|at|}^iand   {|ia|o1h1s3d|at|}^rand {|ia|o1c1d2s|at|}|HT|g|at|^-
opener is showing maximum hands.|
PG| ***** 181 ***** |


at|

Another method to show a good medium or maximum opening hand is to use a

"|CP|8|fp|1|AT|reverse|CP||fp|2|AT|"|
PG| ***** 182 ***** |


AT|

A reverse is defined as voluntarily bidding past the minimum rebid of your suit. Examples are:
^-|HT|o|Va|4|cs|2|AT|{|ia|o1c1s2h|at|}^ior    {|ia|o1d1s2h|at|}^ror  {|ia|o1h2c2s|at|}|
PG| ***** 183 ***** |


HT|s|Va|4|at|^-
A reverse shows a good medium or maximum hand and promises that opener will bid at least once more. 
A reverse also guarantees that the opening suit is longer than
the second suit. For example, in the next auction|
PG| ***** 184 ***** |


AT|
^-|HT|w|at|{|ia|o1c1s2h|at|}|HT|V|at|^i@2^Z@3 opener shows at least 5 clubs, 4 hearts, and a medium/maximum hand. |
PG| ***** 185 ***** |


NT||qx||CS|2|FP|2|at|^-

Playing reverses means that you sometimes 
have to suppress a four-card suit. For example, if you have 5 diamonds, 4 spades, and a minimum
opener, if the auction goes
^-|HT|f|at|^-{|ia|o1d2c?|at|}
^-|
PG| ***** 186 ***** |


HT|j|at|^-
you must respond 2@D because 2@S promises a medium or strong hand. |
PG| ***** 187 ***** |


AT|

Many beginner players find reverses confusing, but 
I think they are an essential tool if you want to become a good bidder. |
PG| ***** 188 ***** |


at|

Opener should avoid being redundant. Every new bid should provide
partner with new information. |
PG| ***** 189 ***** |


AT|

For example, once you open 1 of a major 
partner knows you have at least a minimum opening hand
with at least a 5-card suit. |
PG| ***** 190 ***** |


AT|

Some players will rebid their suit if they
cannot think of anything better. |
PG| ***** 191 ***** |


AT|

Rebidding your suit should promise a six-card suit. |
PG| ***** 192 ***** |


AT|

If you only have a five-card suit, bid another suit or bid NT.

HT|e|cp|8|AT|^B@2^z@3^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|Board six deals with Splinter, J2NT, and Howard's and Bergen's instructions. This is my collection of several key points from Marty Bergen's book titled ^*ISlam Bidding Made Easier^*N and the "Splinters, Jacoby 2NT, and 5NT Pick A Slam" lesson from Howard's web site at ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/##slamlessons^*N in the Slam Bidding Lesson Series section. Again, this is only a summary and only related to points in board six. Please get the full account from above sources.Now, first, the fundamentals from Howard's recent lesson on Constructive bidding with some modifications.|
PG| ***** 198 ***** |


CS|2|AT|

{^*BBidding Objectives^*N}

Auctions have only 2 simple objectives:
1. Bid game or slam if possible, otherwise stay as low as you can.
2. Find a good strain (trump suit or NT).|
PG| ***** 199 ***** |


AT|

Marty Bergen says, "If one of those objectives can be resolved quickly, you are then free to concentrate on resolving the other one." Then he continues,|
PG| ***** 200 ***** |


AT|

"In "|CP|8|at|standard|CP||AT|," Jacoby 2NT is "on" only when:

^c1.  partner opens 1H or 1S in first or second seat;
^c2.  your RHO passes.

When you respond by jumping to 2NT, your bid is alertable. The bid promises:
^Ca.  4+ trumps (not 3);
^cb.  13+ dummy points, with no upper limit. 

Remember: When we have a fit, "points" does NOT refer to HCP only. In addition to sensible evaluating, including Adjust-3, responder must be adding points for short suits." |
PG| ***** 201 ***** |


NT||

HT|d|cs|1|cp|4|AT|^-
{      Jacoby 2NT - A Summary      }
^-|HT|e|cp||at|^B@2^z@3In his book Bergen continues.
"One of the most often-asked questions about Jacoby 2NT is:
Should you respond 2NT when you have a long, strong side suit?" Based on how advantageous it is to "Set the trump suit ASAP," and "Whenever possible, raise partner's major," my answer to this question is a resounding|CP|8|at| "Yes."|CP||
PG| ***** 202 ***** |


AT|

Another important "Jacoby 2NT or not" question for responder is "Should you respond Jacoby 2NT if your hand includes a singleton or void? Let us see Bergen's opinion on that point. |
PG| ***** 203 ***** |


AT| 

"The double jump to the four level in my short suit promises: 
4+ spades,|CP|8|at| 13-16 dummy points|CP||AT|, AND a singleton or void in the suit bid. The Splinter Bid gives partner a complete description of my hand, and he is well-placed to evaluate slam prospects. Would it matter if the hand were stronger? Absolutely." |
PG| ***** 204 ***** |


AT|

Please note the Dummy Points in red. For opener's rebids after a Jacoby 2NT response, the hand falls into one of the two categories--(a) with a void or a singleton or (b) a balanced hand. Here, I only deal with the former as that was the point of discussion in board six. Howard made his point while discussing the board. Next, let us hear it from Bergen. |
PG| ***** 205 ***** |


AT|  

"With a singleton or void, opener bids his short suit at the three level - even if the singleton is an honor. This bid does not say anything about the strength of opener's hand. (FYI: These bids are alertable.)

With a strong 5-card side suit, he has the |CP|8|at|option|CP||AT| of showing his side suit with a jump to the four level. |CP|8|at|Do I love this bid? Hardly.|CP||AT|It is not economical; and in addition, responder will not know the location of opener's shortest suit. As I mentioned earlier, I hate to waste valuable bidding space. Therefore, I'd rather see opener show his short suit at the three level. |CP|8|at|If you insist|CP||AT| on jumping in the side suit, do so only with limited strength: specifically, fewer than |CP|8|AT|14 HCP|CP||AT|."|
PG| ***** 206 ***** |

Next, just to encourage you further to read the book and/or read Howard's lesson I have a short summary of J2N and splinters. |

^-|HT|i|AT|^c@2^Y@3As a firm believer of repetition I would like to  repeat Howard's instructions but in a different format. I easily learn to bid X when I have a hand with Y properties.

^-|HT|g|cp|5|fp|2|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||fp||at|Another common situation is when opener has 20 points, and support for responder's suit, and shortness somewhere else. If opener bids 1 past a jump shift or reverse, that is a splinter. For example,|

HT|j|AT|^B{|ia|,1cp1hp3s|at|}|
PG| ***** 255 ***** |


HT|j|AT|^m@2^Y@3Is a splinter showing 4+ hearts, 20+ dummy points, and spade shortness.|

HT|o|AT|^m@2^Y@3auction is a splinter (2H is a reverse, so 3H is an unnecessary jump).|

HT|t|AT|^m@2^Y@3if you play 4th suit forcing, the jump in 4th suit ( 3D here) is a splinter, because 2@D is 4sf.|

HT|X|AT|^B@2^Y@3Splinters by responder are limited to 13-16 dummy points, because you don't want to take up too much bidding room with more points, as I said before. |
