^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's see how Dee should play the hand. She can count five clubs, two hearts, and a diamond for sure. She needs one more trick. If the diamond finesse wins, she is home free. If the diamond finesse does not win, she can hope we don't find the spade switch, it is by no means obvious. And, in fact, because I have diamonds stopped, and I have 3 hearts, I will play another heart back after winning the diamond. After I play heart back, Dee can now claim 10 tricks: two hearts, three diamonds, and five clubs.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, but remember, the defenders can't see your cards. For all I know, you have some points in spades and some points in clubs. From my perspective, since I know diamonds are not running, and we have heart tricks, a heart back is clear.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not my choice of plays but it worked here. Dee has two Kings, neither of them happens to be the King of clubs, but you don't know that. An interesting hand to play nonetheless. Let's talk about how Roberta might plan the hand. Based on the five of spades lead. Since Roberta  is missing the 4, 3, and 2, I would assume that Patti had a doubleton and Dee had five spades. |
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is possible Patti has a singleton and Dee has six, and that could be a problem if she plays low from dummy. But, given she is missing the Ace-King of diamonds, if that is the way spades are split, there will be some spade ruffs anyway. So, if Roberta ducks the spade, she can count three spades,|hc|SAQJ|

AT|, and a heart|hc|ha|AT|  for sure. She will also ruff one or two hearts in dummy for an easy 9 tricks. So, I would duck the spade.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's assume Dee returns a heart. Win the heart and take the club finesse.|lc|caj854qt96SAQJha|

robzim: I thought you didn't finesse with 9.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We will get to that in a minute Roberta. Once the club finesse loses, Roberta  has nine tricks. Even if they take their 2 diamonds, she has the rest.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now as to how to play a nine card trump fit. In general, missing the Queen you play for the drop as opposed to finessing for the Queen. But missing the King with a 9 card fit, you still take the finesse. Because the odds of a singleton King offside are pretty small, whereas the odds of the club finesse working are 50%. With the Queen, it turns out the odds of either a 2-2 break or the Queen being singleton are slightly greater than 50%. That is why with a 9 card fit you play for the drop of the Queen. But the King is a totally different matter.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT|^B@2
robzim: Then why is the rabbi's rule, "If the King drops let it?"|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It's a joke :). But, some are true to their heritage on this hand by dropping the King :).|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


AT|
robzim: Yes. I listen to the rabbi:).|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me expand a bit further on how to play a 9 card fit missing the Queen. With no additional information, it turns out playing for the Queen to drop either singleton or doubleton is about 51%. Therefore, the finesse and the drop are just about equal. Given that, I use a slightly more complicated approach when I have a 9 card fit missing the Queen. |
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If one person has shown a long suit, even a 5 card major, I play the other person for the Queen. My thinking is, because the person with the long suit has fewer cards outside their suit than her partner. Her partner is more likely to have the Queen. For example on this hand, say Roberta  was missing the club Queen instead of the club King. In that case, since Patti showed a six card suit, I would have finessed Dee for the Queen of clubs.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me do some analysis here.  Patti is showing 9-11.  I have 14 HCP. However, the diamond Queen is suspect, so subtract one ending with  13 Starting Points at best. On the other hand, I do add one for  doubleton diamond, so back up to 14. But, 14 + 11 = 25, not quite enough for game. Thus, I should pass.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not much to discuss on bidding except a brief comment. Roberta should consider a bid of 3C. Then, most likely Dee would show preference for @d With her singleton heart in particular, it is likely we have a fit and if we have a fit, they have a fit. It must be in one of the minors. However, the play is more important. First, discuss the opening lead. Roberta does not have any real good opening leads. However, a doubleton is normally not a good lead. And a doubleton queen is even less good particularly since my takeout double implies spades pretty strongly.|

robzim: Especially since I'd never get to trump the suit--wouldn't want to waste the A@H.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Correct, Roberta does not want to trump anything either. So, the Queen of spades should never even be considered. Probably her best lead is a low club. Next, after trick two when Roberta gets in with the Ace of hearts, leading the Ace of diamonds or away from a diamond is probably not great. She probably should just continue with another spade. She already blew up the spade suit, might as well try and not blow up another suit as well. |
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is possible Patti has the King of diamonds, although she is known to have the King-Jack of hearts and King of spades. So, the King of diamonds would give her a 10 count, which is possible on the bidding. Against perfect defense Patti makes two H, losing one S, one H, two D, and one C. On the other side, Dee and Roberta make 3D losing two S and two C, Proving that aggressive bidding would pay off on this hand. If Roberta bids 3C, whether I bid 3H, or let her play 3D, they come out ahead assuming they defend in such a way as to only let Patti make 2H. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me count my Bergen Points before deciding what to bid. Your first instinct should always be to raise hearts. But. I might be too strong for a simple raise, and since I don't have 4 trumps, I might have to bid another suit.  I have 9 HCP, 1 length, + 2 for singleton = 12 Dummy Points. It is a  clear limit raise but only 3 trumps so have to bid a new suit and show hearts afterwards.

Patti on the other hand has a bad 18, lots of quacks and not too many controls. So, 4H is a reasonable bid.

Patti has to either ruff out her club losers or pitch them somewhere. She cant draw all the trumps before she does something about clubs. That was her error. Once she draws trumps, she has 2 club losers in addition to the heart and the spade. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, I don't mind her playing one round of trumps. But then she has to knock out the Ace of spades. At worst she will lose 1H 1S and 1 ruff. And at best she will lose only 1H and 1S. On this hand, because spades are 3-3 she makes 5. Her other alternative was to ruff 2 clubs, and lose 2 hearts and a spade. But I like knocking out the spade Ace better, as it will often make five that way.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good double, Roberta. Remember, over an artificial bid, if you can make a lead directing double do so. The rule is double if you would like pard to lead the suit and with your clubs you would.  So, whenever the auction is opened 1N and you are behind responder, look for the opportunity to double Stayman and transfer bids. The other common times to double artificial bids is over Bergen Raises and over responses to 4N.

The 9 is a better signal by Roberta. Always play the highest card you can afford. There is no difference between the 8 and 9 in terms of the defense.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, that hand can be made, but let me discuss the bidding first. First, why Patti has a splinter. Once Dee shows hearts Patti has 19 Dummy Points. 14 HCP, 2 points for two quality suits, and three for a singleton with 4 trumps. If Dee has 14 in support of hearts. It is just enough for slam.|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Additionally, if Dee has no wasted values in diamonds, that makes slam a reasonable proposition. The only fly in the ointment that I mentioned, is the of double of 2C which  makes the Queen of clubs rather suspect. So, I might just bid 4H, but 4D certainly had merit.|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, Dee needs to ruff a few diamonds in dummy before pulling trumps. It is the same mistake Patti made on an earlier hand when she pulled trumps instead of ruffing clubs. Wen dummy is short of a suit, you often need to ruff in dummy before pulling all the trumps. That is a very common reason to delay pulling trumps. This hand is one good illustration, as was the earlier hand.|
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let's talk about the Splinter some more, and what kind of cards Dee should have to get her interested in slam. When partner splinters, the best holding you can have is 3 or 4 small. If, for example, Patti had splintered in spades, Dee's hand suddenly becomes very good  because there are no wasted values in spades, which makes it more likely that Dee's honors fit better with Patti's.|
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Conversely, the worst thing you can have in a splinter suit is honors, other than the Ace. Dee's holding in diamonds is particularly bad, given the diamond splinter which demonstrates why it was difficult to even make 4H much less 6H. So, when partner splinters, you should like 3 or 4 small, or 3 or 4 to the Ace in the splintered suit and you should discount any other honors you have in the splinter suit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if  you open 1S and I bid 1N, what do you intend to do Roberta? It is very difficult to bid a 15-17 balanced hand if you open 1 of a major. 1N solves virtually all your bidding problems. Very occasionally, you may miss a 5-3 fit where 4 of the major makes and 3N does not, but hardly ever, maybe once a year. You will get an undo.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even on a spade lead, which is difficult to find,, Roberta makes 3N. Well done Roberta. Lets say Roberta opened 1S. I would bid 1N, and then, Roberta  has a problem. She could bid 2C, or 2N, but either of those could work out badly. And the NT contract is wrong sided besides. 1N works out best more often than not with a 5 card major balanced 15-17.|
pg| ***** 149 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|By the way, Dee Dee wanted to know about the sandwich NT. If one opponent opens and the partner responds (for example 1D-P-1S), if you play the "sandwich NT", a 1N overcall by you after 1S shows the other 2 suits--sandwich NT. It differs from a takeout double as It tends to show a weaker hand and it tends to show better minor holdings than major suit holdings. Depending on distribution, can be 8 or 9 HCP if you are 5-4 with a singleton. |
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is an example: 1D-P-1S-1N

The idea here is it is unlikely you have a strong NT on that auction. And even if you do, pard must not have much. So, some people found another meaning for that bid, the sandwich NT. In this case it shows clubs and hearts, often 5 clubs and 4 hearts. The 1N shows the unbid suits, clubs and hearts in this case.|

"When the King is singleton, play the Ace. Applying this rule means dropping a King singleton offside rather than finessing into it. This is impossible to do most of the time unless you peek at your opponent's hand (illegal)."|

Rabbi's Rule - The whimsical saying, "Play the Ace when the King is a singleton". The creator of the Rabbi's Rule is Milton Shattner, appropriately nicknamed the Rabbi. The probability for a singleton King when there are four cards to king is 12.4%."|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie.
