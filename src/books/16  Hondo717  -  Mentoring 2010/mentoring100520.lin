{      Beginner Intermediate Lounge, Our Home      }
^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Marty Bergen has invented what he calls OBAR bidding.  OBAR stands for "Over Opponents' Bid and Raise" which is exactly what this auction is. You can consider OBAR as a pre-balancing technique. If the auction goes 1x-p-2x, and you are short in the opponents' suit, you should strain to bid. Bidding does not show extra values, just balancing values.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The important thing is to be short in their suit. The three most common OBAR bids that is are:
1) Overcall a reasonable suit, even a good 5 card suit
2) Make a takeout double
3) Bid 2N which is takeout for the minors. It does not show 5/5. It can even be done with 4/4. Remember, partner should not assume extra values.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nicely done Eddy. Let's see how we do in 3C. We lose at least two clubs, one heart, and one or two diamonds. So, either makes or is down one. That is not unusual on competitive hands. Both sides can often make three, or are down one at worst. So, the OBAR bid would have worked out.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to whether Kerrie should bid three. By the law she should not particularly since she has no singletons or voids. In Match points, it is an extremely difficult decision. In IMPs, I think pass is probably okay. Although 3S would tend to work out.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well I am of the opinion that you should splinter with any singleton, even a singleton Ace. Further, assuming  you are not comfortable splintering, would you consider bidding 3H as a limit raise had Eddy bid 2H?|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


AT|
Hope: No. Had Eddy passed 4S would not be my choice here.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I understand your reasoning but if the auction had gone 1S-2H, you should consider bidding 3H--a cue bid. Cue bid as limit raise or better is a very good convention. It helps distinguish between a preemptive 4S bid, and a strong raise. In this bidding cycle 2S bid by Eddy is an artificial bid and implies hearts. In reality he bids hearts and an unknown minor. Therefore, 3H by Hope is a cue bid as a limit raise.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT|^B@2
mojila: Is bidding opponent's suit or the implied suit a cue bid?|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes. If an artificial bid (such as a transfer or Michaels) shows a suit, then bidding that suit is still a cue bid. Therefore, 3H would be a cue bid whether Eddy bid 2S or 2H. Okay Hope now you can bid your choice.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Eddy had no good lead. Double dummy I can be held to four, but there is no way for Eddy to know that. Leading unprotected Aces, as you all know, is rarely a good idea. Normally, a stiff trump can give away a trick. However, on this auction, it is likely I will play Eddy for a stiff trump anyway, so on this hand that is not a bad lead.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One other thing to consider whether Kerrie should sacrifice in 5D. I think at this vulnerability, she should strongly consider it. She has a known 10 card diamond fit and great heart cards. Granted, Eddy might have clubs, then 5H is still possible. On the other hand, if Eddy has clubs, it is not as good a sacrifice. So, bidding 5D is not really clear. But if Kerrie knew Eddy had diamonds for sure, then 5D is a clear bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's talk about what is going on here. Eddy's pass is what is known as a "^*IFforcing Pass^*N." He is telling me: "Partner I am not sure whether to double or bid 5H. I am leaving it up to you." I may not pass. I must either double or bid 5H.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT|^B@2
dee_dee_20: When does a pass becomes forcing?|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is a forcing pass if you have voluntarily bid game non-preemptively, and they bid over your game. In this case, I could have passed 3S if I had a bad hand but I chose to bid 4H. So, from Eddy's perspective I should have some values. If I don't, I can always pull his double had he made one.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let us look at what I need to consider in order to decide whether to bid 5H or double. Shortness in their suit makes me want to bid. My singleton spade would argue in favor of 5H. That is probably the most important consideration. Also vulnerability is important. |
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, that makes things murky. If we were vulnerable and they were not, then we have to beat them a lot. But since they are vulnerable, we only have to beat them 2 to do better. On the other hand, I don't have a lot of points and it is possible we have a double fit in clubs which means they have a double fit in diamonds. It is even possible they are making 4S. After all said and done, I think 5H is pretty clear here.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT|^B@2
whiz: How do you know you have double fit?|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not saying we have a double fit, I am saying it is possible. After all I have six clubs in my hand. Basically bidding 5 has two plusses. It is right if we make it and it is right if they make 4S. It is only wrong if they are down in 4S and we are down in 5H. And even then, it is only a little wrong. On the doubling side, trump length is very important on close doubles.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
EddyHaskel: Don't they have similar considerations about going to 5S after your bid? |
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is a bridge saying "The five level belongs to the opponents." It means, it is okay to bid five over a four bid but it is often incorrect to bid five over five. Therefore, if Eddy doubled, I probably leave it in with AK of clubs.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, you should not Hope. Let's see how 4S does. It loses one in each suit. So, it turns out this is a rare case where the vulnerable sacrifice of 4S is correct over 4H. That rarely happens. Hope made a nice bid based on the law of total tricks, with 10 trumps she bid 4 and it was correct.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this particular board, I have a few comments.
1) The auction is fine through 5D.
2) North should bid 5H. If anything, North should be worried more about making 6 than going down in 5, but still should just bid 5. Voids are extremely powerful on offense, as they mean that the opponents can never take a trick in that suit. As Marty Bergen likes to say, a void reduces the hand to a 30 HCP deck (the 10 HCP in diamonds are worth nothing to the opponents). With a void, you should almost always bid over a sacrifice. |
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With a singleton, you should tend to want to bid, but it is a little more murky and requires some judgement. With a doubleton or more, you should pass or double. |
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3) South should not bid 5H, but should double. South can't let the opponents steal them blind. South takes 5 tricks, for down 3. 500 is not as good as 650, but it is way better than the 150 they scored. In a  BBO IMP game, I suspect if you doubled you would only lose 2 imps or so on the board. On this hand, North's pass is a "forcing pass", meaning that South must either double or bid 5H (double is clear here by South). A pass is forcing when the opponents bid a sacrifice over your freely bid game (which is what happened on this hand).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As she suggests, she can try and set up clubs. Her best play there, given limited board entries is to try for the 3-3 break. So, ducking the second club is fine. At least then she knows how clubs break once she plays the third club.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When that doesn't work, she has to Hope for either two spade tricks or that I will be endplayed in hearts. It turns out, if she then leads a spade once clubs don't work, she gets her extra tricks. The point here is to leave yourself as much flexibility as possible. Regardless, it is very difficult to play the hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First a few comments on the auction. I think 4H was a tad aggressive. 3H is sufficient. My 2H bid does not show extra values, simply hearts. Let's count South's Dummy Points. To her 10 HCP minus one for @SJx, although not really because of my 1S bid, add one for the fifth club, and add two for the doubletons for almost 12.5 Dummy Points. Using Bergen methods we need 26 for game, so I need at least 13 or so to bid 4. So, 4H is ok, just a tad aggressive. However, I would bid 4 with the South hand anyway.|
PG| ***** 173 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, let's look at losers. It is hard to say in hearts, but on average the hand will lose two heart tricks and one diamond. So, South has to Hope that spade works, and if spade works, may be able to get rid of diamond loser. My plan would be as follows. Win the diamond, and take the spade finesse. Then cash the AK of clubs. Next, play the Ace of spades, and ruff a spade, with the 9 if Ira follows to the third spade.|
PG| ***** 174 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Then, play the Queen of clubs, pitching a diamond from hand. Now, you can afford to lose three trump tricks since you have no outside losers. In general, you have to Hope the spade finesse works, which is somewhat likely given the auction and then Hope you can play the hearts for 2 losers.|
PG| ***** 175 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the best way to play hearts, I would play low to the 9. If that loses to the 10, then I would play West for a heart honor, probably the Queen. So, lead the Jack next time. Ira has offered to research probabilities of winning two or three tricks holding @HK953 and @HJ876 holding.|

The following is the correct way to play the heart suit.
^CNorth     ^GSouth
^C@HK953    ^G@HJ876
Lead the 8 of hearts and let it ride if West does not cover. If East wins with the Ace or Queen then play the J next. If East wins with the ten then play the seven next. This line makes 1.9 tricks on average, makes three heart tricks 6.2% of the time, and makes two heart tricks 87.6% of the time.|FP|2|at|

^-|
CP||fp||tu|1|ht|g|cs|2|cp||fp||at|
^d @H@2With Fourth Suit Forcing you can initiate a game forcing auction while keeping the bidding at a @E@3lower level. Without it, you would be forced to gamble on game when you are uncertain of the correct strain. Fourth-suit-forcing in particular helps partners avoid bidding a doomed 3NT because neither hand contained adequate stoppers

Naturally, you may find some experts playing Fourth Suit Forcing as invitational at two level and forcing at three level. However, here a strict "game force" is adopted. The following explanation by Mr. Howard Schutzman puts the entire issue in a nutshell.

"I play 4SF unconditionally establishes a game force, whether at the 2 level or 3 level. Some do play  2 level invitational, 3 level forcing, but my feeling is there are many other sequences where you can show invitational strength, but often none where you can show game strength, so I think the unconditional game force is simpler, handles more situations, and makes much more sense."

pg| ***** 185 ***** |


at| You cannot bid clubs either. |
pg| ***** 186 ***** |


at|

Furthermore, with 13 HCPs you want to be in game. But which one?  It seems that you must choose between 4@S and 3NT.  But your partner may have only two spades at best and bidding 3NT with two small hearts is dangerous. Here Fourth Suit Forcing (FSF) comes to the rescue. Bid 2@H and wait for more information from the opener.|
pg| ***** 187 ***** |

^B@2Your bid should be 2@H which is Fourth Suit Forcing (FSF). FSF is a convention designed to deal with this challenge.|
PG| ***** 188 ***** |


aT|

Your 2@h bid says nothing about the suit in question. It simply establishes a "game force" and asks opener to bid again  giving further information. For example, after your  2@H partner should bid 2@S with three-card spade support or 2NT with a heart stopper. Unable to do those partner should pick a suitable bid. |

            The following situations are mainly when you might want to use FSF: 
               ^DA.    You are asking whether partner has 3-card support for your  5-card major;
               ^DB.    You are interested in NT game but lacking stopper in the fourth suit;
               ^DC.    You do not have a natural bid; or
	       ^DD.    You have "an opener" hand. Note again that you are the responder.|
pg| ***** 198 ***** |


AT|

^C@2You may need more information on "an opener" hand. Sure here is what Howard responded to my quarry.|CP|8|AT|

"Responder has to carefully evaluate his/her hand after getting the second bid from opener which is the third suit. Now, an opener hand is required plus other conditions for a FSF bid. Generally speaking, using the Rule of 20 to establish whether or not a hand is an opener is a good methodology and will work most of the time. However, based on the auction, you may upgrade some hands where you have a particularly good fit but ostensibly only invitational values or downgrade some hands that meet the rule of 20 where you have a bad fit. 

For example, if you have a hand with heart and club support and partner bids hearts and then clubs, you might decide a hand that is just short of an opening bid is still good enough (an opener) to bid game. Similarly, on the same sort of auction, if you have a 5/5 hand with spades and diamonds that meets the rule of 20, you might be concerned about a misfit and downgrade your hand a bit." |

^c @H@2The third priority is to rebid a 6-card suit (or a 5-card minor). Most likely opener bids 2@H with 6 hearts (or 5 good ones).  Sometimes, however, partner can be stuck. The bid simply denies a diamond stopper, 3 card spade support, and 5 clubs. Partner is often 2-5-2-4. For example, give partner xx AKxxx xx AKxx. |

^c @H@2You don’t have an obvious bid. However, you would like to know that partner has some help in spades, before committing to 3NT. Then, bid 2@S -FSF.

^c @H@2Bid 4@H. You can be pretty sure that partner has five hearts. Partner would open one Diamond with a 4-4-4-1 shape.  |

^c @H@2You certainly want to be in game, so you can't bid 3@D, as this may be passed. Were you considering 4@D? That would have been a jump over 3NT which is possibly the best contract. Please consider a FSF. Use FSF and bid 2@S. |

^c @H@2You have nothing in spades. You have a perfectly satisfactory bid. Do not consider FSF.  Bid 3@D. Partner will know whether to bid 3NT. |

at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N
