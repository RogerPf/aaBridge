{      Beginner Intermediate Lounge, Our Home      }
^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This was an interesting competitive hand. First lets discuss the bidding then we will discuss the play a bit. With my shortness in the majors, some people would choose to bid 3C with my hand, particularly since pard is a passed hand, and I would not quarrel with that. But I felt I had a pretty good hand, and also six not seven clubs, so I chose 2C rather than 3C. |
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What should Elizabeth do? I think negative double is best, rather than a 3C bid to show a limit raise in diamonds. 2H is an interesting call by Pam, since it shows her values and gets me off to the best lead. However, it normally would tend to show a fifth heart. Another possibility from Pam is 2D, limit raise in clubs. But 2H worked out very well. Often lead directing bids do. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Marty Bergen would agree with Pam's bid. So, you are in good company Pam. The rest of the auction is fine. Elizabeth, with her void in clubs had a very good 4D bid. Voids are incredibly powerful when in the opponent's suit. Better than an Ace, because they guarantee no losers in that suit.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, because of Pam's nice heart bid, we got off to the best lead. otherwise we don't get our ruffs. And Anna may even make the hand. However once we get off to a heart lead, she is down, having to lose 2 hearts a ruff and a spade. My only suggestion to Anna is at trick four on the King of clubs, she pitch a heart from dummy rather than a spade. |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Then she will not lose to the Jack of hearts, and may only be down one. One other minor point. Pam with her spade holding would like a spade back. So, at trick three when she leads a heart back, it should be the Jack, not the 10. It is not clear that is a suit preference, but the 10 is definitely a suit preference for clubs the lower suit. It doesn't really matter as Anna wins the Ace and can pitch a heart on the club anyway. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |

@D@D nome: Now, if you wish, you can play this hand double dummy. Opening lead by South was heart three, however, you can choose a different lead. Just click any card from that hand.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me address the 2 level overcall question. You do have to be careful with 2 level overcalls, particularly vulnerable. With a really good six card suit, which Pam has, it is not dangerous, as it is very difficult for the opponents to double. So, the better your suit, the fewer points you need. And the better your suit, the more you want to make a lead directing bid, so that is another reason to overcall. It is a risk/reward calculation, and with a good suit, the reward far outweighs the risk.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am going to lead a spade, but let me discuss which one is the proper choice. Normally most people on BBO lead high from 3 small to deny an honor. However, when leading partner's suit that you have not supported, as in this case, it is better to lead count. You should lead low from three small in partner's suit if you have not supported her yet. That way he/she can tell how many you have, which is usually more important than whether or not you have an honor. |
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


pc|S3|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had I supported spades, then my highest spade (the six) would have been correct, since she knows I would not support with a doubleton. In this hand, a low spade is correct to give count.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Anna bid diamonds, so you should save them Pam. Your spades are probably not cashing. Remember I led low showing 1 or 3, and given that Anna bids diamonds and hearts, it is much more likely she has one and I have three. A good habit to get into is to start counting out declarer's hand ASAP. For example, if I held Pam's hand and saw the lead, I would immediately place Anna with one spade. Then I would watch trumps to see how many hearts she started with. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding was fine. I hope everyone would bid 2S with Pam's hand, despite the vulnerability. She has all her values outside the opponents suit, and her spade suit is incredibly good. In fact, even without the King of diamonds, 2S is a reasonable bid. |
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The last point need mentioning is by LOTT I could bid 3S. But I have no spade points, and I am not sure how good my club points are, and I have no shortness, so I thought the conservative pass made more sense here.|

UP|44|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First, let's discuss the 2H bid. New suits by responder are forcing, whether or not there is an intervening overcall. Some people play new suits by responder to an overcall are not forcing. I don't like that approach  because it makes it very hard to bid many hands. I like to keep it simple. New suits by responder, whether pard is opener or overcaller, are forcing. |
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What should Elizabeth bid? Certainly pass is one possibility. However, she likes her six card heart suit and stiff diamond. A negative double is a very reasonable bid. Then if Elizabeth later bids hearts, she is showing a long suit with a weak hand, a hand not good enough to bid 2H directly. So, if you make a negative double and then "correct" to your suit, that shows a hand too weak to bid your suit directly. That is exactly what Elizabeth has.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play. There were a couple of interesting issues there. At trick two, once Pam sees me lead a diamond, she should want to play trumps. Granted, if I have 7 spades, pard may have none. But it is more likely I have six spades and pard has one. Therefore, when I lead a diamond, she should play low and let Anna win the trick and play a spade. That way Pam does not have to lead away from her spade honors, but can still get spades lead. |
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Trick nine is the other issue. Anna should consider ruffing the Ace of diamonds with the J of spades. If you remember, Pam had Qx of spades at that point. Had Anna done that, then, I had to ruff with the King. And if I ruff with the King, then Pam's Q of spades ends up being good. That play is known as an "upper cut."|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


AT|
lcmdir: How do I know that I should do that?|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You don't really, would have been easier if Pam led a lower diamond. But since your Jack of spades is not worth much, it might occur to you. The upper cut is a nice trump play that comes up on occasion. It is good to think about it when you are short in trump, but have a relatively high trump. I am not saying you should have seen it Anna, just pointing out it did exist on this hand. It is a good defensive technique to keep in mind.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is an interesting problem for my hand. Many people play that they always bypass diamonds in favor of bidding a major. But I believe you only need to do that with a weak hand. With a stronger hand, where you can bid both suits, bidding up the line saves room and has some advantages. So I will only bypass diamonds with a hand that is not good enough to take a second bid and show a new suit. The disadvantage of my doing that is if there is a preempt, it is possible to lose the heart suit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Your lead was correct Pam particularly since Elizabeth freely bid the suit. However, spade five would have been more accurate. Further, I am not criticizing your bid Elizabeth, just explaining why a low spade lead was fine.|

lcmdir: Toyed with 2C opener....but decided it wasn't sane.|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, you have a clear 1C opener Anna. Particularly with strong minors, you have to have a really good hand to open 2C. Marty Bergen has his "4 and 4" rule for opening 2C when you have a major. |
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The "4 and 4" means that you need 4+ quick tricks and four losers or less. Further, he does not use Losing Trick Count. He actually figures out how many losers he thinks he has. So, AK10xx is not a one loser suit, it is probably a 2.5 loser suit for example. But AKJ10x is a one loser suit. I use a slightly different rule.  I see if my hand can take nine tricks. |
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Sometimes it is not obvious, but with Anna's hand it is. She has an 8 trick hand, 7 clubs and a heart. If the Queen of hearts were the Ace of hearts instead, I might very well open 2C. Some people would also open Anna's hand a "gambling 3N." People do that with a solid minor suit and 8 sure tricks. My rule is I have to have eight top tricks. Anna has eight sure tricks, but only seven top tricks, so I would not personally open a gambling 3N. But if we change her KQ of hearts to the Ace of hearts, I would open it a gambling 3N. |
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Other people play gambling 3N shows an 8 card solid suit with no outside Aces or Kings. However, I think that is way too restrictive. Please note it is "gambling". Sometimes you might miss a slam, but the idea is the reward is worth the risk. That is the point of making these risky bids. If you are afraid to take risks, don't bid them.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|They made five because of the diamond split, but let me suggest a different line. Once Elizabeth draws trump, she should work on diamonds because as long as diamonds split no worse than 3-1, she will take 11 tricks--five hearts, three diamonds, two spades, and one club.|
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Again remember to count your tricks when planning the hand out. So, after drawing trumps she should play Ace and another diamond. If diamonds are 2-2, as they are on this hand, she makes 12 tricks. If they are 3-1, she makes 11 tricks. She also makes 12 tricks if Anna happens to have a singleton King or Queen of diamonds. However, the key is to ignore spades and play diamonds.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, Roberta, despite the horrible trump break you made 3S. Bidding is almost always better than passing. Dee's 3D is aggressive but I like it particularly at this vulnerability. She is not we are. Speaking of preempts, the worst seat to preempt in is 2nd seat. The reason being is you already know your right hand opponent doesn't have that good a hand, making it more likely partner has some values and you will be preempting partner. So, some people who are aggressive preempters in first and third seats are much more conservative in 2nd seat.|
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Before I go on, several people have asked me about Dee's 4 card major.  I personally think that if you have a preempt, you should preempt regardless of whether or not  you have a 4-card major. A preempt is a disruptive bid. You are giving up precision for aggressiveness. If you are worried about missing a better fit, then don't preempt. Usually, it is rare that you can make four of a major when you have a preempt. Therefore, I don't believe you need to worry about whether or not you have a 4-card major. I think preempting is one of the best bidding tools there is.|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


NT|^B@2
don211: Yes, but preempt tells your pard you do not have a 4-card major.|
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Why should partner care if you have a 4-card major? By the way, many people disagree with me. I am just telling you how I feel. Certainly, if you are not comfortable preempting with a 4 card major, that is fine.|
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Anyway, let's talk about balancing. Balancing means someone opens the bidding and it goes pass pass, so you are in the pass out seat. If you are in the pass out seat, and short in the opener's suit, you should strain to bid even with as little as 9 points at the 3 level! The point is, there are many hands that partner will have to pass over the preempt. So, the balancing position should strain to bid when short. |
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In Roberta's case, she has 2 choices--double or 3S. With fewer points and a doubleton heart, double would be iffy. But because she has 16 points, she can correct to 3S, even though her suit is not ideal. The diamond holding is not the problem, the heart holding is. If your club suit and heart suit were reversed, she has a clear double. Personally, here I would double, double and correct to show the points, but 3S is reasonable as well.|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


NT|^B@2
aspiring: Howard I have a question with Patti's hand not many HCP not Vul. Can she bid 4@d making it much harder for Roberta to bid if she has an opening hand? It would be a pure sacrifice bid really. Making it hard for you to find fit at the 4th level.|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You have a good argument.  4D could work out very well. But, the case against bidding 4D is a law of total tricks issue, they only have nine diamonds.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That was an interesting hand. Let's discuss the auction first. My 4S bid shows 4 cards in spades. It is called a "super accept." Some people play that not only do I need 4 spades, but the maximum range for my 2N opener. But, I play that I just need 4 spades. Remember, the ninth trump is very important, and I know we have at least a 9 card fit. You can also play super accept when you open 1N by bidding 3S over the 2H transfer.|
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now lets look at Patti's hand. She has 11 starting Points--10 HCP plus two length points, and minus one for dubious doubleton Jx of hearts. But, once I support spades, she can add another one for the sixth spade and one for two doubletons for a total of 13 Dummy Points. Since, I have at least 20, and probably more, bidding slam makes good sense.|

^-|HT|f|FP||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|I am not a huge fan of Losing Trick Count (LTC), but it has its place. Let me discuss the mechanics first. Basically, every suit has up to three losers in it. So if you have three plus small, your suit has three losers. With an Ace, or King, or Queen, you eliminate a loser from that holding.|
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


fp|2|cs|4|AT|

Three Plus Cards Suits
^-|FP||AT|^B@2^Y@3
Any three plus card suit have three losers unless it is headed headed by a Queen, a King, or an Ace. Such suit has only two losers. Suit holdings such as AQx, or KQx, or AKx has one loser.|

Two-Card suits
^-|FP||AT|^B@2^Y@3
Two-card suits such as Qx or worse have two losers. There is only one loser in suits such as Ax or Kx.  Ax or Kx has one loser, and AK is no losers. |

^-{        Losing Trick Count - LTC         }
^-|HT|f|FP||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Each hand can have a maximum of 12 losers (three losers in each suit). So, the combined partnership can have a maximum of 24 losers. Now, if you take the combined losers in both hands, and subtract from 24, that is how many tricks your side should be able to take. For example, if the partnership has seven losers for each hand, 24 - (7 x 2) = 10, the side could make four because making four is 10 tricks.|
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


AT|

That is the essence of losing trick count, take the combined losers between the two hands, subtract from 24 and that tells you how many tricks you can take. The question is, how do you figure out how many losers partner has. There are some rules of thumb.|
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


AT|

A minimum opening hand tends to be seven losers, a medium hand tends to have six losers and, a maximum hand tends to have five losers. A 2@C hand is usually a four losers or less. |
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


AT|

Similarly, minimum responder hand (6-9) has nine losers and a medium responder hand (10-12) has eight losers. |

^B@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Having said all that, I don't use LTC to figure out how high we should bid. I like LOTT much better. But here is where I sometimes use LTC. One very good use is to only when to open 2@C--if you have no more than a four-loser hand. Unless you have a balanced hand with 22 points or more, in which case you open 2@C and rebid 2N. Beside the borderline 2@C hands, LTC is a good guideline when I am deciding how good my hand is (for example, is it worth a reverse?). I might use LTC in that situation.|
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


AT|

So, I use LTC where I am not sure whether or not to open 2@C, I won't open unless I have four losers or less. When trying to decide whether to reverse, I need to have a six-loser hand, otherwise not a reverse. Similarly, when deciding whether or not to jump shift, (for example, 1C-1H-2S), I like to have a five-loser hand.|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


AT|

In summary, I rarely use LTC, just for those few hands where I am not sure how good my hand is.|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie.
