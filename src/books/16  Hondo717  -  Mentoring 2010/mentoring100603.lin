^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I have an interesting problem. Partner did not make a negative double, which is actually a good thing from my perspective, because she can't have too many spades. And partner cannot have too many hearts given my length. Therefore, we must have a minor suit fit. On the other hand, I have some good defense.  Normally on this auction I would be short in hearts and have a clear reopening double.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We discussed my bidding and play. Let me discuss the E/W hands. They have a nine card spade fit which they missed.  I don't mind Kerrie overcalling hearts. In general, when you overcall, if you are 5/4 in the majors, it is usually better to overcall your 5 card suit rather than double. If you double, partner will never play you for a 5 card major, and more often than not, that is the suit to play in. |
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even here, they do have an 8 card fit (although they lack the top hearts). The problem is Kerrie does not have the right hand to bid 2H. First she has a pretty good hand and second, most of her points are outside of hearts. So, I think 1H would be sufficient. That would allow Eddy to make a bid, perhaps 1S (although 1N would not be bad either) and at least gives them a shot at finding spades.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2H is not an unreasonable bid though, and often it will work. Had some of her points been in hearts rather than outside, even with 10 HCP, 2H could work out real well. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The heart nine is the right idea, but the heart eight is the play. When you have a sequence, play the lowest card of that sequence. I will give you the undo.|

UP||at| hope: Thank you.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


pc|H8|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Basically, there is two principles of third hand play that are illustrated here. The first is, when you have honor-10 or honor-9 surrounding dummy's honor, you play the 10 or 9. In this case, Hope wants to keep the K if possible to cover the Queen. So, if she has the 9 or 10, she should play it. Why then did I make her undo the 9? Because another principle is, when you have a sequence of cards and are planning to play one of the cards in that sequence you play the lowest card in that sequence.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Hope correctly deduced she should play the 9. But because she has the 9-8 sequence, the play is the 8. The 9 and 8 are equivalent, but by playing the 8, I can work out Eddy does not have the 9. That is why you play the lowest of a sequence as it gives your partner the most information.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First, let's discuss the 2N bid. That was a very good bid by Eddy. Sure, he is worried about spades but he wants to get across the point that he is not worried about hearts. 2N gets that across, and allows Kerrie to bid 3N when she has the appropriate hand. If it turns out we have five spade tricks off the top, so be it. But, first off, we have to find the lead, and second, we have to have 5 spade tricks. As Marty Bergen says "Don't worry about sneak attacks."|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let us discuss the club play by Eddy. On this particular hand, it was right for him to play safe and take his eight tricks. But in general, if you are missing the Queen and Jack, and one of those falls on the first trick, as what happened here. It is much more likely that it is a singleton than QJ doubleton. So, if Eddy were short a trick, playing the 10 would be absolutely correct, and he should feel very unlucky if the finesse does not work. |
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That principle, where the honor is likely singleton, so you finesse the other person, is known as the "Law of Restricted Choice." There is actually a very cute article about it on the Internet somewhere, where they explain it using the old "Let's Make A Deal" TV show as an analogy.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, you should give count. Normally Kerrie would do attitude, but since she knows I have the AK, and the Q is in dummy, she cant possibly want diamonds. So, the rule is give attitude as your first priority. But if it is obvious you don't like the suit, as on this hand, then give count.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Again this hand illustrates why proper defensive carding is so important. One comment on Hope's 2S don't bid.  2S is a better bid than 2C, although with her hand 2C is legal with Hope's hand, showing clubs and another suit. On the other hand, 2S is much more preemptive and hence a much better bid. In fact, there is now a revision to DONT where if you have just a long heart suit, you bid 2H, again because it is more preemptive.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not much to discuss on the play. Now let's discuss a bit of the bidding. The double by Hope was ok, given she was a passed hand. Next, let me explain responder's options over a takeout double. In the old days, it was very simple. You redoubled with 10 or more points, any other bid promised less than 10 points. That is still a good way to play if you like. Although I think Jordan 2N, where a 2N bid shows a limit raise or better, is a good convention as well. |
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, the experts have a more complicated system over the takeout double. They play bids at the 2 level are not forcing and are < 10. So, hypothetically, if Eddy had bid 2C over the double, that would show a weak hand with 5+ clubs. It would not show 10 points, most people don't know that.  |
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, experts play 1 level bids over a takeout double are forcing, just as if Hope did not double. So, 1H is unlimited (ignoring the fact that Eddy passed for the moment). But, I sort of like the simple redouble with 10, and any other bid denies 10. It is simple and effective  plus Jordan 2N if you wish. BTW, most experts use Jordan 2NT over minors as well, but it should be discussed.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nicely done Anna. My first comment is on Moe's 3D bid. Let us evaluate his Bergen Dummy Points. He has 7 HCP, has one length point, one for quaity suit, and he has four points for the void. That adds up to 13 Dummy Points. I, I am not sure I would bid 4C splinter with his hand. I might content myself with a limit raise (bid 3C), and then bid game over 3S. Regardless, 3D is a very big underbid. Remember, length and shortness are very valuable. Bergen hand evaluation really helps you figure out how good your hand really is, independent of just HCP.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had we been playing straight limit raises (e.g 3S could be passed) then I would splinter. But, because 3C allows me to get to 4S anyway, on marginal hands, I tend to make a limit raise and then bid. On the other hand Ira is correct and one could argue that 4C is more descriptive. But I sometimes choose to make a limit raise and then raise partner to 4 on marginal hands which I don't think are quite good enough to bid 2N or splinter with. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||qx|B5|at|That is more a style thing, and I would not argue with anyone who chose to bid 4C with Moe's hand. On this hand it turns out not to matter what Moe does, since 4C makes the West hand very bad and partner will bid 4S and hope that it makes.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First, let's discuss how to evaluate your hand after my splinter. Anna had an easy 4H bid, since she had a minimum response. However, if she had 10 or more points, then it becomes important to evaluate if my 4C bid makes her hand better or worse. The best holding opposite a splinter is 3 or 4 small. The next best holding is Axx or Axxxx. Honors other than the Ace in the splinter suit are bad, and need to be heavily discounted. So, if partner splinters, you should upgrade your hand with 3-4 small or 3 or 4 to the Ace, and downgrade your hand otherwise.|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to the play: Anna has a number of issues with this hand, due to her aggressive partner :). She knows for sure that she has 2 spade losers and a heart loser. The question is how to get rid of the diamond loser. One way is the diamond finesse. The other way is to hope the fourth spade sets up. There are entry issues, but the best play is probably to play a heart to her hand and lead low towards the 10 of spades. |
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The trick is to avoid the diamond loser. So, you need to do that by hoping that the fourth spade sets up and you can pitch it, barring that, there is the diamond finesse. Because there are entry issues, against good defenders it will never make. However, the best play is still to try the spades first.|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie.

CANADIAN MASTER POINT November 1993 
Restricted choice -- fact or fiction? 
by Eric Sutherland 

"Over recent months, we became involved in a correspondence between two of our readers regarding the Principle of Restricted Choice. Briefly, we can state the "con" argument as "the cards have no memory"; in other words, if the a priori odds favour playing for a 2-2 split, then the fact that East has dropped one of the missing honours doesn't change anything. The mathematics of all this can get pretty complex, so we appealed to the Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Waterloo for some help. After further correspondence, we received the following submission from Eric Sutherland, a UW undergraduate as well as a member of the Canadian Junior bridge team. |

PG| ***** 148 ***** |


PC|h6|at| and we are at the crossroads: do we finesse or play for the drop, and how do we know? |
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


NT|^B@2
"The principle involved in this type of situation is called the Law of Restricted Choice. There is a lot of dissent about this Law, because it seems to defy logic. After all, what happened to "eight ever, nine never"? Why would the probabilities suddenly change in the middle of the hand? |
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


NT|^B@2
"The reason why Restricted Choice works is this: if LHO had the doubleton queen, jack to begin with, then he had a choice of cards to play on the first round, because the queen and the jack are equals. If he had the singleton queen or jack, then his choice of what to play is "restricted" to that queen or jack. |
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


NT|^B@2
"Let's look at some percentages. First, assume that with QJ doubleton, LHO will play each card 50% of the time at random. Since the probability of his holding QJ doubleton is 6.78% (2-2 break is 40.7%, with 6 combinations), LHO will play an honour from QJ doubleton about 3.39% of the time. The probability that LHO has a singleton honour is about 6.22% (3-1 break is 49.74% with 8 combinations). As a result, the finesse on the second round rates to win about twice as often as it loses (6.22 to 3.39). |
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


NT|^B@2
"Sounds simple? Well, let's throw a little kink into the works. Let's suppose that you are playing against opponents whom you know from experience would never play the queen from QJ doubleton, or even people who play the jack from this holding by agreement (I've seen it!). |
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


NT|^B@2
"Now let's examine the odds. If LHO plays the queen, he must have a singleton, so it is definitely right to finesse, but if he plays the jack, he could have either a singleton jack (6.22% of the time) or a QJ doubleton (6.78% of the time, since they would never play the queen); in this case it is right, albeit by a very small margin, to play for the drop. Similarly, if you are playing against someone whom you know always falsecards, and would never play the jack from QJ doubleton, the same holds: finesse if you see the jack, and go up if the queen is played. |
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


NT|^B@2
"A word of warning, though: be very sure of your opponents. If you do choose to play for the drop in these situations, then you are going against the field, and single-handedly creating a potential swing that your partner or team-mates may have to pay for later. |
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


NT|^B@2
"The moral of the story? Make yourself familiar with the usefulness of Restricted Choice, as it crops up in different situations. On defense, play your queens and jacks randomly; when on play, know your opponents; but above all, play for the 2-1 odds. You don't get those odds in real life....or do you? |
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


NT|^B@2
"Remember "Let's Make a Deal"? Monty Hall tells you that there is a fabulous prize behind one of Doors 1, 2, and 3, but there are "zonks" behind the other two. You choose Door 1, and Monty opens Door 3 to show you a giant rocking horse. He then asks you if you want to switch your choice to Door 2. Do you switch? This problem has caused more heated arguments than you can imagine. |
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


NT|^B@2
"Bridge players should have no difficulty recognizing another Restricted Choice situation here! Switch to Door 2, and your odds of winning are 2-1, not 50-50. Let's say that Door 1 was the right door -- then Monty could have chosen to show you Door 2 or Door 3, with equal probability. However, if Door 2 was wrong, Monty was forced to choose Door 3, since Door 2 has the prize behind it. Because he is forced to pick Door 3 when Door 2 has the prize, and only picks Door 3 half the time when Door I has the prize, Door 2 has a better shot at making you a winner." |

^B@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||fp|2|at|4@D is the correct bid. The singleton Ace may be a concern for some. First, this is still 13-16 dummy points with a singleton. Some people recommend against a splinter bid here. But Bergen feels you can still splinter with a singleton Ace. So, he would recommend you bid 4@D with this hand. Bergen feels the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. I have no experience yet to say whether I agree or not, but when in doubt I tend to go with Bergen's opinions. He rarely steers you wrong.

^B@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||fp|2|at|4@D is the correct answer.

First of all, we need to agree that South should splinter in diamonds. 3@D  bids not a splinter, merely a game try in hearts, with diamond cards. Partner does not know South has such a good hand, since 1@H can be made on 6 points. Therefore, 4@D is a diamond splinter, since it is an "unnecessary jump." As to whether you are too strong. The hand is worth 17 declarer points. However, partner is limited to 16, so in this case, a 4@D bid is warranted, because you are not really taking up too much room. What you are trying to convey is interest in slam if diamond shortness is valuable. Without the diamond shortness, slam would be extremely unlikely.

^B@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||fp||at|The final topic on splinters is follow ups when partner splinters.  As I mentioned before, the best holdings in the short suit are no honors. Bergen feels 3-5 small is the best holding. So, if partner splinters and you have 3-5 small, your hand really goes up in value, because your other honors are working well with partner's cards. Another good holding is Ace with 2 to 4 other small cards. It is not  quite as good as all small cards, but almost as good. |
PG| ***** 205 ***** |


AT|

Bad holdings are shortness, doubleton or less, and high cards other than the Ace. So, if you have those holdings, your hand goes down in value. Let us look at some examples next.|

So, slam is quite possible. the only fly in the ointment is that you might have 2 diamond losers. So, you bid 4@H. partner knows that you are interested in slam, but don't have a diamond control. Partner will bid 4@S with no diamond control, otherwise 4N or another control bid with a diamond control. Therefore, your 4H conveys the exact message you want to send.

HT|S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3I am sure you noticed that Hands 4-27 and 4-28 are indeed the same hand. |CP||AT|The difference is in the auction. In 4-27, the auction goes 1@H-1@S-4@C, which devalues the 1@S bidder's hand quite a bit, due to the club points. In 4-28, the auction goes 1@H-1@S-4@D, which improves the value of the 1@S bidder's hand quite a bit, since he has only small diamonds (the J is not worth much). So, in 4-27, the 1@S bidder should simply close out in game by bidding 4@S. In 4-28, the 1S bidder should look for slam. He can do that by either bidding 4@H (control bid), or jumping right to 4N, since he knows that all suits are controlled (partner has diamonds controlled, and he has hearts and clubs controlled)|
