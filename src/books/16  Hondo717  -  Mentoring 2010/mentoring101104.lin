^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, here is a good example of where Bergen points really help. Both Kerrie's and Eddy's hand are much more powerful than they appear and it takes a club lead to beat it, which is not obvious. A possibility would be for Nada to double the 5C bid, but that is not clear at all. If she had the @CK, she should double for sure, but with the @CQJ, she knows a club lead won't hurt, but she may talk me out of a better lead.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also, if Nada take the @SA on the first round, later Eddy pitches a club on @SQ  and still makes 6. Second hand low did not hurt. She just traded a spade trick for a club trick. Second hand low is almost always right, as it was on this hand :).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have an unusually good hand given there is a NT opener. DONT is predicated on the fact that once there is a 1N opener, game is very unlikely, so you are competing for a part score. But, if we have a good diamond fit, it is barely possible we have game. Normally with diamonds I would pass but my hand is so good, I have a rare 3D bid.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This was really excellent bidding and nicely played. Very intricate and nice auction. Let us discuss the control bidding sequence. First of all, the 2S bid initially, that is asking about a NT stopper. However, it could also be a slam try in clubs, depending on Yvon's follow up. In this case, since Yvon pulled 2N to 3C, that said the 2S was not a stopper ask, but a slam try in clubs. With a 7 card clubs suit, and very nice controls, Linda wants to accept slam, so should control bid.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally, Linda would bid 3H to show a heart control (void in this case). However, given partner bid hearts, the heart void is probably not useful. In fact, it is probably a detriment. That is why I think 3S is a better bid. 3H should show a heart card, not shortness once pard bids the suit. 4D by Yvon was fine and 4S now showed the spade Ace.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Control bids work as follows. When you bid the same suit twice, the first time you bid the suit it shows either first or second round control. If you repeat control bid the suit, it shows first round control. That rarely comes up with Italian control bids, but it does on occasion, as on this hand. Anyway, nice going.|

PG| ***** 70 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, once pard cue bids, you are in a game force on that particular auction. On other auctions, such as say 1S-2C-3C, where 3C is a limit raise or better, that is not forcing. But, on auctions where pard is asking about NT stoppers, the cue bid establishes a game force.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another very interesting hand. The dealer must be on drugs today, lol. Everything through my negative double is pretty standard. I am not quite strong enough to bid 2H, so I bid a negative double, I was then intending to bid 2H over 2D, to show long hearts and a hand not good enough for an immediate 2H bid. But, Linda screwed up my plans by bidding 5C, lol, which has merit by the law. There is a known 11 card fit. |
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yvon's 5D bid is quite reasonable. Remember, if they have a fit, you have a fit, and on this hand it is likely to be in diamonds from Yvon's perspective. It turns out 5D is down 1, but if the spade finesse works 5D makes. |
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let's talk about if Linda should bid 6C. It could be right. However, there are a couple of factors which argue against a 6C bid. She  has no singletons or voids and she has points in our suits. So, her hand is not bad on defense. Therefore, I think she should hope that she pushed us to a non-making game. There is a saying "the 5 level belongs to the opponents." That is definitely an oversimplification, but it has some truth. What it means is, that it is ok to bid 5 over 4 but it is not as likely to be right to bid 5 over 5. |
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And on this hand, that turns out to be true as they can't make 5C and we can't make 5D. In summary, I think Yvon's 5D bid was correct but I think Linda should hope she has some defense and pass 5D. There are certainly plenty of layouts, given the same cards in both hands, but different distributions, where 5D makes. Again, preempts make things tough, for both sides. It is more a matter of guessing and using sound principles.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well this was a hand where, in hindsight, I think my opening bid was wrong. Normally, I don't like to open 1N with 2 doubletons. I like my 1N openers to be 4-3-3-3 4-4-3-2 or 5-3-3-2. But, on this hand, I have a hard rebid over 1H or 1S. 2C is too weak, 3C is too strong given my suit, which is ok but not great, and 1N is also a bit weak. So, if I open 1N, it gives partner a better idea of what I have. It is a slight lie, but not a bad one. Not sure how we do in 3N on a diamond lead. I think it makes because hearts behave very nicely. So, had I opened 1N, we get to 3N or 4H. 4H is even easier.|

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Bergen Raises
hT|e|
CP||fp||at|^-First, a brief explanation of Bergen Raises by Howard.
^-^B@2^Y@3"Bergen Raises are used by responder after partner opens one of a major and responder has 4 cards in the opener's suit. ^*BReverse Bergen Raises^*N, which I recommend, works as follows. Responder must have exactly 4 card support. The point count specified is (Dummy Points), as defined in Bergen's book Slam Bidding Made Easier."|
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


CP|8|FP|2|AT|

- with 5-6 points, responder jumps to 3 of the major (more on this later), |
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


AT|
- with 7-9 responder bids 3 diamonds (known as a "constructive raise"), |
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


AT|
- with a 10-12 responder bids 3 clubs (known as a "limit raise"), and |
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


AT|
- with 13 or more responder bids 2N or Splinter (the usual Jacoby 2N raise played by many
^b  partnerships)."|
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


FP||CP||AT|

"One of the important advantages of Bergen Raises is the preemptive jump raise (with 5-6 points). Modern competitive bidding theory says it is safe to compete to the 3 level with a 9 card fit, and Bergen Raises allow you to do this in a way that preempts the opponents."|
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


FP|2|CP|8|AT|^-

{"If the intervening opponent bids, Bergen Raises no longer apply."}|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


AT| 

^-|CP||FP||AT|"I suggest you play the following methods over interference. If the opponent bids a suit, 
- a cue bid shows a limit raise (10-12) with 4 card support. 
- a jump raise shows less than a limit raise (6-9) with 4 card support.

Over a takeout double, 
- 2N shows a limit raise or better with 4 card support (this convention is known as Jordan 2N), and a 
- jump raise still shows less than a limit raise (6-9) with 4 card support."
|
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


NT||
HT|E|at|^B@2^Y@3"Some people play regular Bergen rather than Reverse Bergen. The idea is basically the same, only the meaning of the 3 club and 3 diamond bids are reverse, 3 clubs showing 7 to 9 and 3 diamonds showing 10-12. The reason I prefer Reverse Bergen is that you want to explore for game more often over a limit raise than a constructive raise, and Reverse Bergen gives your partnership more room to explore. However, if your partner insists on playing regular Bergen, most of the value of Bergen Raises still applies."|
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


CP|8|FP|2|AT|

"And finally, yes, I still play Bergen by a passed hand. I cannot think of any good reason why Bergen would be off with a passed hand." |

However, your Bergen Raises skill would not be complete until you read Bergen's new book, Better Slam Bidding with Bergen. |

What you will read next is an attempt to give you most common Bergen Raise treatments in a table. I used the table from Bridgehands as a template and made the upgrading using Bergen's book and Howard's teaching on the topic. The table contains the common treatments in Bergen Raises. The treatment for rare hands and situations which would be the topic of debates between experts are not included. A thorough discussion with your partner is a must before adopting all or part of Bergen Raises.

It can either show 5-6, and partner should raise to 4 with 18+. Or it shows 0-5, and partner must pass virtually all the time. The only possible exception being she/he is very distributional with long spades and a 5 or 6 card 2nd suit.  --  if she/he didn't open 2@C, then game is very unlikely.

Now, time for a few quizzes on Bergen Raises. You are sitting South and your partner opens one of a major. Further, please note that there may be more than one good answer. I have updated the original version to comply with Bergen's new hand evaluation technique. No details on counting the hand values are given here. For that information review either his book or Howard's lessons from his web site.|

^b@22@S is the correct bid.
South hand value = 6 Dummy Points (5 Starting Points plus 1 Dummy Add-ons). Let me quote Howard on this issue, "I really dislike the idea of 1@S-2@S or 1@H-2@H being a constructive raise with 3 card support; most modern players agree with me. So, if the auction goes 1@H/1@S-1N-2@C/2@D-2@S, that shows exactly 2 spades. If you have 6-9 with 3 card support, it is best to raise immediately, as it has both preemptive and informative value. |
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


at| Further, Bergen plays "semi-constructive raises to 2" where with a very bad hand and 3-card support he will first bid 1N and then correct to 2 of the major." |

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|The hand is officially only worth 12 Dummy Points, not 13, as you need to subtract 1 for the KJ of spades. However, because partner bid spades, I think it is wrong to subtract the 1 point, as the J of spades will most likely prove very useful.

This is a case where you have to take into account the double fit. If you have controls in all suits, you can count 12 tricks 5 clubs, 1 diamond, 5S, and a diamond ruff, since you can pitch your diamond on the last club. So, you should bid 4@D, to make sure you have hearts controlled. If partner bids 4@H, you can then bid 4N. Then, if you are missing one key card, bid 6, if missing no key cards you can bid a grand slam. Basically, you can picture 12 tricks, since you know partner is 5-5 in hearts and clubs. However, if partner bids 4S, you must pass, because you know you have 2 heart losers.

First of all, we need to agree that South should splinter in diamonds. 3@D  bid IS not a splinter, merely a game try in hearts, with diamond cards. Partner does not know South has such a good hand, since 1@H can be made on 6 points. Therefore, 4@D is a diamond splinter, since it is an "unnecessary jump." As to whether you are too strong. The hand is worth 17 declarer points. However, partner is limited to 16, so in this case, a 4@D bid is warranted, because you are not really taking up too much room. What you are trying to convey is interest in slam if diamond shortness is valuable. Without the diamond shortness, slam would be extremely unlikely.

|hf|P|lb|*BNow, What bid would you make?^^4h|HT|q|fp|2|at|^c@2^y@34@h is the correct answer. First remember that 4C means pard has 4 spades, 20+ dummy points, and club shortness. So, slam is quite possible. the only fly in the ointment is that you might have 2 diamond losers. So, you bid 4@H. partner knows that you are interested in slam, but don't have a diamond control. Partner will bid 4@S with no diamond control, otherwise 4N or another control bid with a diamond control. Therefore, your 4H conveys the exact message you want to send.

|hf|P|lb|*BNow, What bid would you make?^^4s|HT|q|fp|2|at|^c@2^y@34@s is the correct answer. Even though this hand has more HCP than the last hand, it is not nearly as good based on the auction. Your club points are wasted, so 4@S is the bid.

HT|S|CP|5|AT|^B@2^Y@3I am sure you noticed that Hands A-27 and A-28 are indeed the same hand. |CP||AT|The difference is in the auction. In A-27, the auction goes 1@H-1@S-4@C, which devalues the 1@S bidder's hand quite a bit, due to the club points. In A-28, the auction goes 1@H-1@S-4@D, which improves the value of the 1@S bidder's hand quite a bit, since he has only small diamonds (the J is not worth much). So, in A-27, the 1@S bidder should simply close out in game by bidding 4@S. In A-28, the 1S bidder should look for slam. He can do that by either bidding 4@H (control bid), or jumping right to 4N, since he knows that all suits are controlled (partner has diamonds controlled, and he has hearts and clubs controlled)|

at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N
