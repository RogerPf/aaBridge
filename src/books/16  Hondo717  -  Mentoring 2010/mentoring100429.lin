^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

Roberta  does not likely have more than 4 hearts and might even have less. And even with 4, there is a reasonable possibility of a bad break, given my preempt.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This was an excellent bid by Roberta  and play by Patti. The bidding illustrates an important point. Over a preempt, try not to make a bid that takes you past 3N. Because that can often be the right contract. So, double was a much better choice than 4D by Roberta, as it gives their side much more flexibility. Most people would have bid 4D with her hand and thus miss the much better 3N contract.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, Patti did a great job in finessing the diamonds. It is unlikely I have the Queen-Jack of diamonds. And even if I have a stiff honor, by finessing twice, she just about guarantees 5 diamond tricks along with the 2S and 2 Aces, that guarantees 9 tricks. Very well done Patti :).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good try. The problem is in the bidding. Let me discuss third and fourth seat openers. My personal style is to use rule of 20 in all seats. Some people light third seat openers.  My problem with light openers is, there are some hands where I might have passed originally and pushed to game if pard opens. So, opening light in third seat makes that difficult to do. But, if you play Drury, that problem is lessened. If you decide to play light third seat openers, I suggest you play Drury as well. |
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to fourth seat, as I said, I like rule of 20. But, some people like the rule of 15, which is you should open if your HCP + spades is 15 or more. You can open a 10 HCP hand if you have 5 spades in 4th seat if you use the rule of 15. Again, I am not a big fan of it, I like rule of 20, but you should play what works for you. Having said all that, Eileen does not have a fourth seat opener, using either the rule of 20 or the rule of 15.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well done John. Let's discuss the bidding first. I play that you still can super accept with 4 card support over a transfer, even with a 2N opener even if partner has zero points, the 9 card fit makes it possible you can make 4H. And partner almost never has zero points. So, I would have bid 4H with John's hand, although 3 hearts is certainly quite reasonable, and what most people would have done. |
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, should I have tried for slam? First of all, let's discuss how good slam is. You have two potential spade losers, and one potential heart loser. Basically, the hand is on two of three finesses. Now, most of you might assume that the odds of two of three finesses working is less than 50%. But, actually, it is exactly 50%. The combinations are all finesses lose, two finesses lose, one finesse loses, or no finesses lose. So, in two out of four cases (one finesse loses or no finesse loses) the contract makes. Hence, the odds are 50% that you will win two of three finesses. It is  counter intuitive, but true.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As far as the play, there is actually a sure fire way to make the hand as the cards lie. Let me see if I can reload the hand and show you. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me remind you that, over 4H, South could bid 4N and hope there are not 2 quick losers in diamonds or spades. Or South could bid 5C, and North with controls in both diamonds and spades could bid 6H. I would probably choose the 4N route. It is less scientific but, less accident prone. I believe in "no accident bidding" if a choice between a possible misunderstanding or a clear cut bid, choose the clear cut bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very well done Sandy. This was actually a fairly straight forward hand. The only question is the best way to play the diamond suit. There are two choices. One is to play the Ace and hope they are 2-2, an honor drops, or Dee has both the King and Jack. The other is to finesse against Roberta  twice, hoping she has at least one honor. I actually think I would have gone down on the hand, as I believe playing the Ace is a slightly higher percentage.|
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The only other comment is about spades. Normally, Dee should keep "parity" with dummy, meaning keep the same number of spades as dummy. However, since her highest spade is lower than my 9 of spades, there is no point. If Sandy has KQx, the spades are running anyway. In general keep parity with dummy, but in this case there was no point doing it in spades.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general Dee should prefer bidding a major. With 5 spades, 1S is a better bid. Had Dee had four spades and those good diamonds, 1D is fine. But, with five spades, it is more likely you will miss a spade fit if you don't get them in right away. So, 1S is correct.|mb|1sp|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, lets see how they do in spades. They probably take four spades, two diamonds and a heart for sure. That is only seven tricks. The diamonds set up due to the good break, so they probably take two more diamonds for 9 tricks. And also Dee can guess the clubs and get a club trick with the King. It is apparent that 2S is a better contract than 2C.|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


lb|*bWhat would you bid here?  ^^2c|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now if Dee bids 1S, Roberta  has an interesting dilemma. Normally, with good 3 card spade support and shortness, Roberta  would have a clear 2S bid. Remember if it goes 1m-P-1M-P-2M. the 2M bid tends to show four, but can be done with three card support and a distributional hand. However, since Roberta  has seven clubs, and only three card support, I think rebidding clubs has merit as well. |mb|2c|
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Then, the question is, how many clubs should Roberta  bid, 2C or 3C. Using losing trick count, Roberta  has a six loser hand, which is a borderline 3C bid. Using Bergen Starting Points, Roberta  has 13 HCP + 3 length points = 16. And since Bergen recommends a jump with 17 or more, that says 2C is his preferred bid. So, I think 2C is slightly better than 3C.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


mb|P|NT|^B@2
Chipmonk: It seems to me the bidding would go 1@c, 1@s, 2@c, P, 2@d, P, P, P.  Roberta would have to decide to go to 3@c or not.|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|if it went 1C-P-1S-P-2C-P, it is not clear if West should bid or not. With a stiff club, pass is rather attractive, as they may smell a misfit. However, if West decides to bid 2D (not what I recommend), then East has a clear 2S bid.|
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


NT|^B@2
dee_dee_20: 2@s would have been a responder's reverse :(.|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not sure what is meant by a responder's reverse. I don't really understand the concept. New suits by responder are always forcing whether you reverse or not. Further, the auction 1C-p-1S-P-2C-P-2D is no weaker than 1C-P-1D-P-2C-P-2S. At least in my book. In either case, opener must bid again. I guess the only argument is, by bidding spades and then diamonds, opener's rebid is at a lower level.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well done, Roberta. The play was straight forward. However, let me just do a quick review of Bergen Raises for those not familiar with them. In SAYC with no Bergen Raises, if you have a limit raise, you would bid 3H with my hand. That would show 10-12 points and four hearts if you are not playing Bergen Raises. However, Marty Bergen feels that based on the law of total tricks, with a nine card fit, you want to preempt the opponents by bidding 3H with a weak hand--less than 7 points. So, he decided 3H would show a weak hand with four card support. |
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That makes it more difficult for the opponents to bid when they have a lot of points. The question then is, how do you show a limit raise. Well Bergen decided there are four types of hands with four card support. The strong raise, 13+ with four card support, is taken care of by bidding Jacoby 2N. There is also the limit raise 10-12, the constructive raise 7-9, and  the weak raise less than 7. So, 1H-P-3H is the weak raise (< 7). There are two bids available to show the constructive raise and limit raise. |
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|They are 3C and 3D. As originally defined by Bergen, 3C shows the constructive raise, and 3D shows the limit raise. However, many people felt that it would be more advantageous to be able to explore for game with a limit raise than a constructive raise. So, they play Reverse Bergen, which simply reverses the meaning of 3C and 3D. 3C is a limit raise, 3D is a constructive raise. That is the way I play it. However, Marty Bergen feels that it is more important to be able to explore with a constructive raise.|

^-{        Writing on the Sand - by nome         }
^-|HT|f|CP||FP|1|at|^B@2^Z@3B|FP||AT|ridge information stays with me as long as writing on the sand at the beach. It takes only one soft wave to wash everything away. However, as I get older I become more persistent and keep writing on the sand--reviewing the material over and over. However, for this week I like to bring you a good read. It is the "Fore-Word" for ^*IWhy You Lose At Bridge Table^*N by S. S. Simon. Charles Goren wrote it in March 1, 1946 and I only bring you the last section where he is quoting from the book. The book is a great read any many teachers recommend it. Please enjoy it.|

Mr. Simon's attitude is that of a practical player. He is not so much interested in telling you how to improve your technical skill. Rather he aims to show you how you can get the best results using the skill you already possess. Moreover his ideas are presented in such a light and amusing manner that I am sure the casual reader will find the book delightful as well as instructive.|

I can't end this introduction without quoting two paragraphs which seem to me to typify his very human attitude toward the game. |
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


fp|2|AT|

"Keep your bidding simple. Approach when you must and take the direct route whenever you can. Never feel compelled to use a convention where it cannot help you, merely because you happen to be playing it. If you know you want to be in a small slam contract but not in a grand slam, bid six direct. Do not bother with the four-five No Trump routine. Why tell the opponents you have four Aces?

"Whether you are aiming at a part score, a game or a slam, the moment you have decided what your contract is to be, BID it. It may not be very spectacular, it may evoke the jeers of those that like to wander around the world to reach a contract that can be reached in a couple of bids; but believe me, it pays. You will lose fewer paints during the year if you stop trying to be scientific all the time."|

Though the author's avowed purpose here is to tell the average player how to lose less, there isn't the shadow of a doubt in my mind that even the more experienced player, following these precepts, will win more.
