^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is an interesting hand for two reasons. One is, Eddy's 2N bid illustrate the Bergen principle of "Don't worry about sneak attacks." In theory, a club lead beats the hand, but unless Kerrie was talking to Hope on the phone, there is no way for Hope to figure out to lead a club. Sometimes you just can't figure out the best lead. A heart lead was fine--would be my choice. My second choice would be a spade. I really think a heart is best. On the other hand, though the "sneak attack" theory worked on this hand I would bid 3D with Eddy's hand.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other point to this hand is the spades. When one hand has only honor cards, you need to unblock that suit immediately most of the time. In this case, Eddy must cash the two spades in dummy while he still has an entry to his hand. That situation does occur fairly frequently. So, remember to unblock suits with honors and no low cards if at all possible.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |

@D@D nome: Now, if you wish, you can play this hand double dummy. The opening lead was heart seven, you can choose a different lead. Just click any card from that hand. When finished or if not interested in the double dummy feature please, click the forward arrow to move to the next board.

Pear: What point count do you need for unusual 3NT?|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not too much 8 or 9 points, but suit quality is more important. Unusual 2NT is generally used in direct seat over an opponent's opening bid, but can be used in other types of auctions, too. If an opening bid is passed around to you, you can balance with an Unusual 2NT. Say, 1D by LHO-Pass-Pass, 2NT by you would be unusual 2NT, showing clubs and heats. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Again a preempt did its job. Kerrie has a tough bid. With her hand, I might pass, and see what develops, as Eddy will be bidding so Kerrie will have another chance. But double was certainly not a bad choice. The problem with these hands is, even if Hope  has 4 spades, the likelihood of a bad break is much higher. Your bid was perfect Hope and I think pass with Kerrie's hand is best. Had she passed, it turns out Eddy bids 3D, and she should be willing to defend.|

PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Marty Bergen recommends the rule of 20 in conjunction with his counting methods as follows. He defines "adjusted HCP" as all of his Starting Point rules ^*Bexcept length^*N (e.g. raw HCP, adjust 3, quality suits, dubious shortness). If you take "adjusted HCP" + length of 2 longest suits and that equals 20, then you have an opening hand. Eddy's hand does not quite make it because his adjusted HCP are 9 -- 10 HCP + 1 quality suits - 2 dubious doubletons. So 9 + 9 = 18. If you changed his hand to Q109x AJ10xx xx Kx then he would have an opening hand using the Bergen methods.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, 18-19. If I had 15-17 I would have opened 1N. So, a rebid of a jump to 2N always shows 18-19. It should almost never be passed  even with a six count. It is only right to pass if 2N makes exactly and 3N is down 1. My rule is that I never pass a 2N rebid. However, I also never stretch a response to 1C by bidding with a 4 point hand. I always try to have six points to respond.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We talked about bidding. Let's do play. With a non-spade lead  and careful entry management declarer can set up diamonds and make 6 or 7. Win first club in hand. Lead King of hearts and low heart to 8. Trumps now out. Then play King and A of diamonds. Next, ruff a diamond. With 3-3 break diamonds are good and the two spades can be pitched on diamonds making 7. If diamonds 4-2, lead heart to Ace, ruff another diamond. Then, lead club to carefully preserved King and pitch one spade on diamond making six. Key to the play is to preserve dummy entries.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Eddy had a textbook DONT distribution. His bid showed diamonds and a major. I am a big fan of bidding DONT with any excuse. As you know, my motto is "bid early, bid often." I will bid DONT with as little as 4-4 if I have close to an opening hand and with as little as 8 or 9 HCP with 5-5. If my points are in my suit and not vul, I am even more daring. You are competing for a part score, and giving up on game because once there is a strong NT opening, the likelihood your side has game is pretty low. You can be more aggressive with DONT, and know partner won't hang you too much.|

Playing hearts establishes a third heart trick for E/W at the expense of one trick for N/S. I am sure kia will include this in his movie, and you can try it double dummy :).|

at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N

^-{        DONT - by Howard         }
^-|HT|f|CP||FP|1|at|^B@2^Z@3I|FP||AT|n normal DONT:
Double shows unspecified one-suiter and responder is forced to bid 2C. |
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


AT|
2C, 2D, 2H shows two-suiter hand (usually at least 5-4). It promises the suit bid and a higher-ranking suit. For example 2C bid means holding clubs and one of the other three suits. 2D means holding diamonds and an unspecified major and 2H means holding hearts and spades. With at least three card in bid suit responder is content to play in that suit and passes. Otherwise, bids the next higher suit or in rare cases a long suit of his own. |
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


AT|

There are two choices to show a single spades suited hand. A 2S overcall shows minimum strength. Double-then-2S over mandatory 2C bid by responder shows a strong spade suiter hand. |
PG| ***** 171 ***** |


AT|

That is normal DONT in short. As usual there are parts to normal DONT convention which occurs rather infrequently and I do not review them here.|
PG| ***** 172 ***** |


AT|

Personally, I prefer what is known as "revised DONT" which I will explain next. However, regardless of whether you play normal or revised DONT, if you have single suited spades, I think you should bid 2S, not double because 2S is very preemptive. If you double, you don't take up much room. As you recall DONT stands for "Disturb Opponents' No Trump"  and double is not very disturbing, lol. So, I like revised DONT and I always bid 2S with spades over 1N. |

If you play revised DONT, to show hearts and spades, you double, and bid 2H over partner's forced 2C.|
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


AT|

Now, three important points:
With DONT, you cannot penalize 1N using a double, but it is rare you want to anyway.
In revised DONT, a double shows either a single suited minor or hearts and spades.
There are more occasions of single suited hearts and spades hands thus bid 2H with hearts only and 2S with a single spades suited hand.|
