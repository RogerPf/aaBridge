{      Beginner Intermediate Lounge, Our Home      }
^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.
Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

nome: As a note for those who may not be familiar with the mentoring sessions I would like to mention that a teaching table is used for the mentoring sessions. Therefore, Howard can see all the hands. But, he plays his hand as he would have done in real world on a none teaching table. Further, the other players see only the dummy's hand.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, let's discuss the bidding a bit more. For the very reason that it happened, I like to play that a cue bid, particularly at the three level promises four trumps. That way, you follow the law of total tricks. Although Dee has 11 HCPs, she really has a pretty bad hand. The Jack of diamonds is likely to be worthless and she has lots of other Queens and Jacks. Believe it or not, I would be content to bid 2H with her hand. It is barely possible we miss a game, but not likely. It is more likely, as happened, if I cue bid, we will be down in 3.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Using Marty Bergen's counting method the hand has 9 Starting Points--11 HCPs less two points for two dubious doubletons. After the heart overcall the hand is worth 10 Dummy Points. That is barely a limit raise with 3-card support.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the defense, Roberta made the correct opening lead. If she had no diamond honors, she can lead high since she supported diamonds. Because she led low, showing an honor, and she would not lead away from an Ace, she must have four to the Queen which means Patti started with three diamonds. |
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With that information, I know at least eight of Patti's cards--five hearts and three diamonds. Lots of times these inferences make no difference, but if you get in the habit of thinking about them all the time it becomes easier, and when you need the inferences, you have them at your fingertips with not as much thinking involved.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over 2C, I did not bid 2H. I also did not make a negative double. So, what should Roberta do? |
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|She has a nice six card suit, so I would rebid it. I know that feels like an underbid, but it is unlikely we have game in hearts once I can't raise. Another alternative is to reopen with a double. Particularly vulnerable, best to be a bit cautious. Making 2N opposite a weak hand is difficult and you only have one club stopper to boot. After all said and done, I think 2H is best, double is my 2nd choice, 2N is a distant third choice.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, let's talk about this hand. The bidding in particular. 1S and 2C are fine as is pass by Dee. Now, lets talk about what Roberta should do. One of the things to consider when it goes bid-overcall-pass-pass is a reopening double. Especially if you are short in the overcalled suit. Remember, since we play negative doubles, Dee cannot make a penalty double. So, it is up to the opener to protect against a possible penalty double by partner by reopening with a double.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, with Roberta's massive two suiter, 2D is a much better bid than a reopening double. But you definitely need to keep reopening doubles in mind, and strain to make them when you are short of the overcalled suit. In fact, with the void in clubs, one could make a case that Roberta should bid 3D. However 2D is sufficient.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us count Roberta's Starting Points. 16 HCP, + two length points + two quality suits = 20. However, she knows they don't have a good spade fit, or if they do Dee has a really bad hand therefore, a spade game is fairly unlikely. 5D has plays, however, as it turns out.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, I do have a quarrel with Patti's 3C bid. She does have a good suit but, it is only 5 cards and she has little else other than the King of hearts. Also, she knows Roberta is short in clubs, and I did not raise. Therefore, it is likely that Dee has some length in clubs. On the other hand, once she bids 3C, Dee must make a bid. She should either double or bid 3D.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would double. With a void in Roberta's first suit, it is likely the hand will go for a big number. The only thing a bit worrisome is Dee's four diamonds. Trump length is always good on defense  and the good thing about the diamond length is you can force Patti to ruff, and run her out of trumps. So, my first choice is double, my second choice is 3D. If you double, then you do better than bidding and making 5D. By not doubling, you ended up not doing as well as those people who bid game in diamonds.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Tough hand to play with the spade break, but lets see how we might plan. Once the club finesse wins, you can count two clubs and a heart for sure. And, if spades break 3-2, four spade tricks. That is seven tricks. You need two more. Probably the best line is to lead diamonds from dummy twice, hoping that Elizabeth has at least one diamond honor. In that case, one diamond ruff plus one diamond honor will get you to 9 tricks. SO, I would have led a diamond at trick two. However, with the bad spade break, it is likely you will lose two spades and two diamonds and a heart and be down one anyway. Regardless, I still think planning the hand makes sense.|
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now as to the bidding. Over 1S, I have a slight preference for 1N rather than 2S, but either could be right. It is true diamonds are a worry in NT and the spades are not bad.  2S is certainly reasonable. I tend to like to have the A, K, or Q with only 3 card support, but it is not an essential requirement. With a singleton diamond, for example, instead of a doubleton, 2S is a very good bid and even with the hand as is, many experts would bid 2S.|
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the opening lead, a club is certainly reasonable, as it is the only unbid suit. A spade would be reasonable with a different holding, but it is quite possible a spade will give up a trick given West's holding. Although I don't like leading the opponents suit, singletons are usually strong leads  so a heart is another possibility.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In an uncontested bidding, 2NT in that particular auction means 11-12 points and no four-card major and it is not forcing. 3NT in 1D-P-3NT auction promises 13-15 points and no four-card major. Over an overcall, there is no change to the meaning of those bids, except you should have a stopper in the bid suit. Further, to bid 2C you need at least five clubs and 10 plus points. My main point here is responder is the captain of the hand. That means you are responsible for making sure you get to game when you have a game forcing hand. On this hand, you have an opener and you must make some forcing bid below game, or bid game. So let me give an undo.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, I know that Roberta  started with exactly three spades. How do I know that? Simple, Dee led a low spade, promising three. There were seven between dummy and my hand so, six between Dee and Roberta. If Dee had a doubleton she leads high. She could have four spades, but if she did then Roberta  would have started with two spades. I should know more after the next trick.|

pc|s3|pc|S6|pc|S5|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, it is clear that Roberta started with Kxx in spades. Since on the second spade trick Dee did not play the King, Roberta must have it. Hence Roberta started with Kxx of spades. It is also unlikely that Roberta  has more than three hearts.  I should be able to figure out her distribution to within one card after this trick. Not that it will do me any good on this hand, lol. She was either 3-3-3-4 or 3-2-3-5 to start with.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We talked about some good defensive techniques the last 2 hands. Counting out the hand is a good idea and particularly when you are long in trump, shortening declarer's trump by making her ruff often works out well. However, the biggest thing I would like to impress on you is to try and figure out what declarer has. It is often easier than you think, if you are willing to be a "bridge detective" and take all the clues from the bidding and the play into account.|

at|^C@2^Y@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at| 

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals have closed boards. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N
