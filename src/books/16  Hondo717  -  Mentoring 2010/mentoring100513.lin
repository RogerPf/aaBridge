{      Beginner Intermediate Lounge, Our Home      }
^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, lets do the bidding first. What should Eddy bid over 1S overcall? There are a number of choices depending on style. If you play 2D which shows a limit raise, only promises 3 trump, you can bid that. I personally like it to show 4 trumps, but many play it only promises three. There is an interesting convention known as a "|CP|8|at|Mixed Raise|CP||AT|" that some experts play to take care of this problem. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|They play that both a cue bid (in this case 2D) and 2N show spade raises and limit raise points. The lower of those two bids shows three card support, the higher shows four card support. So, on this auction, if you played that convention, 2D by Eddy would show three card support, 2N would show four card support. On another auction, say 1S-2D, 2N would show three card support and 3D would show four card support. |
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, since most people don't play that what are the choices. 4S is certainly a reasonable choice. The only problem is that it misdescribes the hand a bit. It is unlikely that slam is there so that is not a huge problem. Another choice is 2C, assuming you play that forcing. Some people play new suits by responder to overcaller is not forcing. However, I strongly believe that they should be forcing, just the same as new suits by responder to opener. Playing with my pards, I would bid 2C, and then 4S to show my hand.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play. Knocking out the Ace of clubs right away was a good idea. What Yvon has to worry about is his four low diamonds. One can go on hearts, and one might be able to go on clubs although that requires a 3-3 break. So, I would start the same way as Yvon, but then play it slightly differently. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would ruff the diamond, play another club, ruff a diamond as he did. Then I would play K A Q of hearts pitching a diamond and then play a spade. The only real difference would be use the heart to pitch the last diamond rather than a club.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me explain something here about looking for NT. If there are two unbid suits remaining, bidding that suit shows a stopper. So, in this case a 3H or 3S bid by Yvon would promise stoppers in those suits. If there is only 1 suit remaining, then a bid in that suit would ask, because Yvon would bid 3N with that suit stopped.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That was tricky both bidding and playing. An important rule is to always try for 3N rather than 5 of a minor. There are very few hands where 5 of a minor makes and 3N does not. And there are lots of hands where 3N makes and 5 of a minor does not. So, given the bidding principle I discussed, Yvon should bid 3H. That shows a heart stopper and asks Eddy to bid 3N with a spade stopper. Now, with @SJxxx it is not clear whether or not that is a spade stopper.|

EddyHaskel: Did I have a better way to suggest NT than 3@c bid?|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3C was fine Eddy. The question is what Yvon should bid, and I think 3H is pretty clear.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


AT|
vanyvon: I agree but I believed you had 2 good suits for your vulnerable overcall and also believed my diamonds would provide tricks as any missing honors could be finessed.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to whether with your hand 3N or something else is best is not clear. It also turns out that 5D is much easier than 5 clubs. That is because of another bidding principle. "Whoever is short in the opponents suit should tend to play in their long suit." Because obviously Yvon has plenty of diamonds to ruff spades, but does not have that many clubs. Regardless, this is a tough hand to bid. The most important point is to try very hard to bid 3N whenever you can.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's discuss Eddy's second bid. Using Bergen's method Eddy has 15 HCP, two length, one quality suit, minus two points, one for dubious doubleton hearts and one for quacks being more than Aces/tens for a total of 16 Starting Points. That is just enough to bid 3D, but I have to admit, that looks a little aggressive to me. So, 2D is okay. In 3NT we take six diamonds, one heart, one spade and one club. So, 3NT makes. As I said that before, I meant that you should almost always choose 3N instead of 5 of a minor.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, let's talk about the bidding first. I am a big believer in bidding four of a major over one of a major whenever you have five card support assuming your strength is less than a limit raise. So, with Yvon hand I would bid 4H. That prevents Eddy from bidding spades and giving Kerrie a lead suggestion. |
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next, let's see how spades does. They could lose one spade, when they decide to finesse the spades even though on this hand the Q happens to drop. They also lose one heart, one diamond, and one club. On the other hand, it is possible if we don't set up our clubs that Eddy can pitch his second club on the last diamond. So, 4S has plays which makes it clearer that Yvon should bid 4H.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well bid and played. The bidding in particular was well done. Let us discuss the play a bit. First lets talk about why, contrary to my usual rule of second hand low, at trick nine Yvon made a nice play taking the Ace of clubs, If he doesn't take it, he knows diamonds are set up, and Kerrie will get pitches. So, his best hope is that we can take a couple of spades. It is very rare case of second hand low not being correct. |
PG| ***** 98 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to Kerrie's line of play. The hand always makes 4, losing 2C and a diamond at worst. However, a slightly better line is to duck a diamond right away. That way, I cannot safely lead clubs and, assuming diamonds are 3-2, 5 is guaranteed. And even if diamonds are not 3-2, Kerrie still has a diamond loser. So, ducking a diamond is slightly better.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The proper card is the 10, very important. Whenever playing third hand high, you play the lowest card you can of a sequence. Since Vered played the 10 and Moe the King, I know Vered has the Jack and Moe has the Ace. If the Jack were played, I would assume Moe had the 10. |CP|8|AT|^*GTMH,To read more on "Third Man High" click here.^*N|qx|b6,back|cp||at| You can return back here when done.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let's analyze the bidding a bit first, and then the play. Should Elizabeth bid 2N or 3N? Using Bergen method she has nine HCP, one length point, and one quality suit point. So, 3N is a good bid with her hand. Next, let's analyze the play. |
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Moe has one spades, two club, and two diamonds off the top. So, he needs four extra tricks in the red suits. Attacking hearts was a reasonable idea, as even worst case, he is likely to take 3 hearts. So, I would play the first two tricks as he did, and then lead a diamond to the Ace and another heart. I would play low on the second heart as well. Against really expert defenders, it is hard to say whether to play the King or 10, as a world class North would duck the first heart, even with the Ace.|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But, against most defenders, first of all South would hesitate with the Ace, and second, North might very well not duck the Ace. Therefore, at the table I would play the Queen most of the time. And since hearts are very fortunately divided, that gives Moe four heart tricks and the contract. The bottom line is, Moe should go after hearts first and then hope that the diamond finesse works if the hearts don't come in for four tricks. Again, it is a matter of counting your winners, and figuring out a plan to get to nine.|

^-|CP||at|^B@2^Z@3^*BNew Minor Forcing ^*N|cp||at|(NMF) is a convention used to discover a major suit fit when opener rebids 1NT or 2NT after opening one of a minor and receiving a response of one of a major, such as 1D-P-1H-P; 1NT-P-?. It has the following features which I will explain later.|

{The Third Man High - The Principles}
^-|HT|f|cs||at|^B@2^Y@3When you play as Third Hand--which is to say, when you play the third card on Partner's lead  you should generally play your highest card.|
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


AT|

When your highest cards of your Partner's led suit are in sequence, play the lowest of the sequence--not the highest.|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


AT|

The third hand can never have a card just below the one he played. For example, if the third hand plays the Queen, hecannot have the Jack.|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


AT|

Further, when playing third hand high and holding say @HQJ96 sequence and one of dummy's card is @H10, filling your broken sequence holding, you should play the nine and not the Jack. Or if you hold @H1097 sequence and dummy has @H8 you should play @H7--assuming dummy plays low.  |
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


AT|

When dummy has one honor card and third hand has a ^*Ihigher^*N honor card, third hand normally saves his honor unless the honor is played by dummy. However, third hand must have a card as high as the nine to insert if the honor is not played from dummy.  Lacking a nine or higher to play, third hand plays the high honor. For example, if dummy has the Queen, and you hold @SK10 or @SK9, do not play the @SK; play the @S10 or @9.|
PG| ***** 140 ***** |


AT|

When dummy has an honor that is higher than third hand's honor but played low, third hand should play as if there were no honor in dummy at all. For example, partner leads low and dummy has @DK76 and third man has @DQ45 and dummy plays low. Third hand should play the diamond Queen. |
