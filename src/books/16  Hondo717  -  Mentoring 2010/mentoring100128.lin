^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very nicely played. Before I get into responsive doubles, let me discuss the defense, which was well thought out even though it did not work--see tricks two and three. Elizabeth was hoping Ally had the King of spades, and could give her a diamond ruff. Normally, I am against cashing Aces. But in this case, Elizabeth had merit to do so. In fact, if Ally had the King of spades, it should be clear to give Elizabeth a diamond ruff. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, it was a good thought by Elizabeth even though it did not work in this instance. However, notice that by cashing the Ace, Elizabeth made it easy for the declarer to play the diamond suit. It was a reasonable risk, but it does illustrate the down side of cashing Aces.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to responsive doubles. A responsive double works as follows. First of all, to make a responsive double, your partner has to be an overcaller, either with a takeout double or a suit. In the simplest case the bidding goes 1x-dbl or overcall-2x-dbl. For example the double in the following auction|HT|J|at|^B{|ia|1s2h2sd|at|}|HT|k|AT|^mis a responsive double, and shows the remaining unbid suits. |

HT|o|AT|^n and|HT|N|AT|^p{|ia|1d1h2dd|at|}|HT|r|AT|
^B@2are additional examples of responsive doubles.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


at| It is simple to distinguish between a responsive double and a negative double. A negative double is made after an opening bid followed by an overcall such as|HT|u|AT|^b{|ia|1c1sd|at|}|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


HT|t|at|^m@2^Z@3Therefore, a negative double is made by responder to an opening bid. A responsive double is made by the partner of an overcaller. So, a negative double is the third bid in the auction, a responsive double the 4th bid. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people play responsive doubles only need to show the unbid major. For example, if the auction goes|HT|g|at|^B{|ia|1s2c2sd|at|},|HT|G|at|^M@2^Z@3 some people play that only shows hearts. |

PG| ***** 28 ***** |


HT|k|AT|^B{|ia|1s2c2sd|at|}|HT|m|at|the double would mean hearts and diamonds. |
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


HT|o|at|^B@2Personally, I am not a big fan of responsive doubles. I think they are confusing and they are not universally accepted as to when a double is responsive and what it shows. So, if you decide you want to play them, it needs partnership discussion. Further, they are definitely alertable.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


AT|

In conclusion, if you decide to play them, my recommendation is that a double is responsive if there are two suits remaining, and that the double shows both other suits. The point requirements are the same as negative doubles, perhaps a bit more, since the overcaller need not have an opening hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, on this particular hand, it didn't matter because you want to be in seven if I have one king. But in general there are adantages to minorwood. Ally, can you explain it, as I am not as familar with it as you. Then, we can discuss void showing with RKCB.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


AT|  

camilleln: A bid of 4C asks for 1430 answers and 4D is 1 or 4, 4H is 3 or 0 and then 4S is 2 without Queen and 4N is 2 with Queen.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Is it always 4C, or can it be 4D sometimes?|

camilleln: If in diamonds it is 4D.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|How do you stop in 5C then? Or maybe the better question is, how do you ask for kings? Further, when is it minorwood vs a raise in clubs. For example, is the auction 1C-1H-3C-4C minorwood?|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


AT|

camilleln: After you rebid your clubs, then minorwood would apply in this auction or 1C-4C or 1C-2C-4C.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the 2 specific auctions are 1C-4C and 1C-1X-2C-4C where 4C is asking for Aces.
camilleln: To do King ask, you bid 5D if trump is clubs and 5H if diamonds is trumps. Thanks Ally. I had heard of minorwood, but did not know the details. I guess 1C-2C-4C is also minorwood.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|hondo717: Now, as to why I did not bid 5N over 4N, showing 2 Aces and a void--showing void after 4NT RKCB. You only show a "useful" void in response to Blackwood. And since Ally bid hearts, my hearts was not a useful void. So, you should only show a void in response to Blackwood if you feel it is useful (i.e not partner's suit)|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me quckly go over the responses to 4N with a void. If you have an even number of key cards and a useful void, you can bid 5N. If you have one or three key cards and a useful void, you bid the suit you are void in, assuming it is lower than the key card suit. Let us say hearts are trump. If it goes 4N and you respond 5N, that shows an even number of key cards and an unspecified void. If it goes 4N and you respond 6C or 6D that shows an odd number of key cards and a club or diamond void. And if you respond 6H, that shows a spade void (you can't jump past 6H). |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played Elizabeth. We should not be in 5, as we got a couple of lucky breaks, including the club lead. But let me mention one thing about the diamond suit. When you are missing the Queen and Jack of the suit, particularly with a nine card fit, if one defender drops the Queen or the Jack, then it is 75% that the other defender has the other honor. |
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, once West drops the Jack, it turns out Ally will have the Queen 75% of the time. This is known as "the law of restricted choice." The math is complicated, it is just something you have to remember. |
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand Elizabeth can only afford to draw 2 rounds of trump. But if she could afford to draw 3 rounds, and had a dummy entry, the correct play is to finesse Ally for the Queen once sshmj drops the Jack. The finesse will work 75% of the time.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, unfortunately, I have to discuss both Dee's bidding and play. First the bidding. 3C is a tad of an under bid. Dee has 19 Bergen Points, so I think 2N is called for. Game is a very strong possibility, and there are many 7 or 8 points hands where I pass, as I did. I showed hearts with my negative double, so you should not worry about that too much.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, 3C shows 16-18  or so, responder passes with less than 9 or at least a good eight. The only forcing bid by opener is a reverse or jump shift. Even if 3C were forcing 2N is better as you have diamonds and Patti bid diamond. So, 2N is just as good.|
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to the play. You were inconsistent in the play. If you thought Roberta might have 4C, you should just pitch on the 3rd diamond at trik three, or ruff low. That way she is ruffing with a potential natural trump trick and you will make 4 that way, unless Patti has 4 clubs which is highly unlikely. There was no reason to waste the Queen of clubs. There was no lead where Roberta can hurt you, and they have taken their last trick. The point is, by leading the 3rd diamond, Patti set up a trump trick for them.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, we did make six, and it turns out it makes even on a club lead. Now, let's talk about what Patti should do after the double.  Bidding 3D followed by 4D is not a good idea  because that gives the opponents a whole extra round of bidding. So, Patti takes her choice. Either bids 3D if her heart can't take then pass, or 4D. I think 4D should be seriously considered, based on the Law of Total Tricks. That really puts us in a bind. It could be down two or three. At favorable vul, that is a great bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|well Dee does have a pretty clear pass of 4H. The bad diamond break hurt you Roberta. However, if you duck the first spade Roberta towards your hand (2nd hand low :)) you can lose no spades. So, 5 can be made on my spade lead. Another confirmation of the "second hand low."|

UP|52|NT|
hondo717: Let's talk a little about the bidding. First of all, you should agree on whether or not you open 1 of a major or 1N with a balanced 15-17 and a 5 card major.  I recommend opening 1N, because otherwise it is hard to show your points. Hands with 15-17 are often hard to show, because they are too weak for a jump shift, but more than a min. However, assuming you open those hands 1 of a major, then D's 2NT bid gives K multiple choices. It says first of all choose between NT and hearts. With K's hand I would have chosen NT because of the flat distribution. It also says, bid game with 8 or 9, either hearts or 3NT. So, I would have passed with K's hand, since he has a min, and three Hearts the a bid 3@H is reasonable. It just says he has a min and prefers hearts.|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


NT|
D: If you open your balanced 5 of a major hand in NT, what do you open with my hand, which was a bad 18? |
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: If your hearts had been, say clubs, would you have opened 1@C or 1N?|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


AT|
D: I think 1 Club, but... that's philosophical.|
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: OK, then 1@H is ok.|
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


AT| 
D: I like my NT bids to be exactly what's promised. The hard part is the rebid.|
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Actually I think you have a fine 18, don't see why you think it is bad, you have a nice suit, and lots of A and K.|
PG| ***** 162 ***** |


NT|
D: Because it's just not a good enough 18 count.|
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: I would have either bid 3N or 4@H over 2@H.|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


AT|
D: I just questioned the worth of @d Jack.|
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Well KJ is better than Jx, so I think you can give full value to the J. Had K bid 1N over 1H, I might very well bid 3NT, hoping my hearts take lots of tricks.|
PG| ***** 166 ***** |

%%%%%%%%%
BT||QX||HT|e|cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|To make my instructions better understood, let me recap the last hand. Once K bids, he is showing 6-9, with 3 hearts. So, if D has at least 16, there is some chance that the side has game, if K is on the top of his range (8 or 9). If D has 16 or 17, she should try for game. If she has 18 or more, she should just bid game. |
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


AT|

With unbalanced hand, she could bid 3@H with 16 or 17 (asking K to bid 4@H with 8 or 9) or make a help suit game try. With an unbalanced 18+ point hand, she  should just bid game. With a balanced hand, she could ask K to choose between NT and hearts, because sometimes NT is easier, as 3NT requires one less trick than 4@H. |
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


AT|

If K had a balanced hand as well, he therefore might choose NT rather than hearts. So with a game forcing balanced hand (18+) D could bid 3NT, giving K a choice between 3NT and 4@H. With an invitational balanced hand (16 or 17), she could bid 2NT, giving him both a choice of strain (NT or hearts), and a choice of level (either a partial or game). In other words, if she bids 2NT, K's possible responses are pass with a balanced 6 or 7, 3@H with an unbalanced 6 or 7, 3NT with a balanced 8 or 9, or 4@H with an unbalanced 8 or 9.  |
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


AT|

I would have passed 2NT with K's hand, since he also has a balanced hand with less than 8. But if I had D's hand, I would have bid 3NT, and K again should pass because his hand is balanced.  |
