^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here are the issues when your right hand opponent opens your suit:
a) It looks like a possible misfit so perhaps pass is best but, you are sitting behind the bidder which is good for you, your partner is sitting behind the person who is short, and your partner is short. So that means partner might be able to overruff if you try and ruff your long suit.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|b) If you have another 5 card suit, it is likely you have a fit with partner. The reason is, partner is known to be short in opener's suit, and therefore likely to have 3+ cards in your suit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good contract. The play is pretty straight forward. Once West wins 3 spade tricks, she needs 4 more tricks. She can count 2 diamonds and 1 heart for sure. So leading a diamond to the DQ was fine.  And it will be hard for N/S to not give her another trick.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|After North wins the diamond and reasonably leads back a club, West's 7th trick is the @CJ. As usual, it comes down to counting your winners as declarer. That is the single most important thing you should learn to do to improve your declarer play.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I have a choice of 4 bids, though, Pass is really not an option. I can bid 3@C, 2@S, or 2@D (limit raise). First you have to decide if new suit by responder to an overcaller is forcing. BTW, the term for responder to an overcaller is ^*b"advancer"^*N in case you read that in a bridge article. I am called the "advancer" on this hand.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I play new suits by advancer are forcing but many experts disagree with me. But they are wrong and I am right :). Not really, but here is the problem. If you play that new suits are not forcing, then you have to play cue bids are forcing and not limit raises. And I prefer to be able to show a limit raise with a cue bid.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First I need to decide if I prefer 2@D (limit raise) or 3@C. I prefer 2@D. The downside is I have bad trump support, but I do have 8 HCP, 1 length point, 1 quality suit point, and 2 points for the doubleton for 12 dummy points. So 3@C is too weak for my hand IMO, However, although I like to "support with support" in this case, if partner likes spades, I would want to play in 4@S. So I like 2@S better than 2@D and others.|mb|2S|mb|p|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand once again proves that you really need to focus on using Bergen hand evaluation to see how good your hand is. Judy's hand was worth twice as much as her HCP indicated and that happens quite often on distributional hands. Too many players over emphasize HCP and under value distribution.|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But if you learn Bergen hand evaluation you won't be one of those players. Further, Bonnie should not lead @DA. In general it is a bad idea to lead a suit the opponents have bid. For every time it is right it will be wrong 4 or 5 times. Never mind that I bid clubs. Without any question, IMHO, on this hand Bonnie should lead clubs even though a diamond happens to save a trick.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Excellent Bonnie. The bidding:
Normally responder is "captain" of the hand,  but occasionally it is opener who first realizes their side has game and must take control. On this hand once I bid 2@C, showing 10 points Bonnie, with 18 points knows we must be in game. So she correctly bid 3N to make sure we got there.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|The defenders play two rounds of Diamonds against your small slam in Hearts. One obvious chance of making the slam is to finesse against the @SK.

You ruff the second Diamond and draw trumps with the @HK and @HQ. you continue with the @CK and @CA, ruffing the third round of the suit. When Clubs break 3-3, you cross to the @HA and discard your two potential Spade losers on the good Clubs.|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding marks West with 5-5 in the majors, and East places the contract. We won't spend much time on the Michaels bid, but East, with his singleton Heart and ten-card Spade fit, puts it in game. He has no idea what West's point count is, but he figures if West is weak, his bid will be suitably pre-emptive. |
PG| ***** 206 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We make a standard lead of our @DA, and our Heart falls a little when we look at the dummy. Smart defenders anticipate the declarer's plan of action, and it's clear that all losers are going on the Hearts.|
PG| ***** 207 ***** |


NT|^B@2
At trick 1, Pard gives us a count on the Diamond suit with his play of the @D2, showing an odd number. We figure him for three (when you hear hoofbeats, think "horse," not "zebra". He could have one or five, but...) |
PG| ***** 208 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We know we have three Diamond tricks, and we need one more to set them. Our @CK is not a winner if we lead the suit, so we discard that idea. We really have no hope unless Pard holds the @SQ. It is the only possible card that can set them. And you know what that means. Yup... we play as if he had it. |
PG| ***** 209 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Granny always said, "Never give them a ruff and sluff," but the old gal was wrong. We are going to lead another Diamond at trick 4. If Pard has the @SQ, he'll either be able to play it now, or save it for dessert. West is doomed. |
PG| ***** 210 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We've seen this before. When you have no possible chance of a winner in any side suit, it often makes great defense to give them a ruff and sluff in hopes of promoting a trump card in Pard's hand.|
