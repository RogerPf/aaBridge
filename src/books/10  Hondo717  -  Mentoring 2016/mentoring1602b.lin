^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Based on the "rule of 15" |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=ruleof15^*N|CP||AT| I could open this hand. The rule says if your HCP + spades = 15 you can open in 3rd or 4th seat—12 HCP + spades (3) = 15. But I don't particularly like that rule either :).|mb|p|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would not open with the West hand either. It doesn't meet the rule of 20 or the rule of 15. If you use the rule of 20, I certainly see no reason to open light in 4th seat. You are not missing game.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3rd seat the argument for opening light is that it makes it harder for 4th seat to bid. So light preempting in 3rd seat is a great idea because that does get in the way.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So we got a small plus. Let's see if EW can compete. I think support doubles and redoubles are a reasonable convention. Over my double, if you play support redoubles then West can redouble showing exactly 3 spades. Then Millie can bid 2@S over 2@H which should make, losing 2 hearts 2 spades and 1 club. And it might push us to 3@H down 1.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Anyway, the main points here is the 4-3-3-3 is terrible distribution. If you want to deduct 1 point (or even 2) when you hold that distribution that would be a good idea. I have even been known to pass with a fairly strong hand (16 or 17) when it is flat and both opponents are bidding.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If the @SQ comes down in 1 or 2 rounds you can even take 4 spade tricks. Therefore, after playing a 2nd club, Carol should play the @SA, @SK, and a low spade. That way she makes 2. Again planning the hand at trick 1 is crucial to maximizing your tricks on many hands.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1@H is perfectly reasonable, but in 3rd seat preempts can be particularly effective. So if Millie wanted to open 2@H (or even 3@H with her very nice 6-4 distribution) that would be a reasonable tactic. However, the vast majority of players would open 1@H (perhaps even Howard :) ).|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


mb|2C|mb|2H|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Carol has 10 Dummy points—7 HCP, 1 length point, 2 points for singleton with 3 trump. On the plus side her singleton club is particularly good given my club overcall. On the minus side 3 small hearts is not great support. |
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So it is optional as to whether or not Carol should consider her hand a limit raise or not. However, the point is, everyone should use Bergen hand evaluation. Regardless, we let the 2@H stand for now.|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


mb|p|NT||lb|*mWhich bid would you choose?^4H~3H~Pass^1|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Pass might be right, but Millie has a much better hand than her HCP indicates once pard raises. She has 14 Starting Points—11 HCP, +1 for 2 aces and a 10 and no quacks, and 2 length points.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once pard bids, Millie can count 1 point for the 6th heart (so she now essentially has 3 length points with the fit), 2 points for the singleton, and 1 point for the clubs side suit for 18 Declarer points.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Partner is showing 6-9. And if pard has 8 or 9 they have at least 26 and should be in game. Once again, HCP are only a small part of how good your hand is on distributional hands. She only has 11 HCP but her hand is 65% better than that (18). She has at the least a clear invite.|mb|3H|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good pass. I know it hurts. The bidding principle here is when partner made an invitational bid, if you make a bid you are "accepting" her invitation. Therefore, you must pass even though 3@H might play better on this hand. |

PG| ***** 144 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It might have crossed your mind to look for a slam on this deal. As it is, even 4@S isn't safe. It would have been a cake-walk against any other lead but this West has found the best lead for his side. Curse the man. Well, you know the routine. Count and Plan.|
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|There may be a loser in the spades - everything depends on the suit break. There are three losers in hearts. No possible loser in diamonds—four tricks. No loser in clubs.|
PG| ***** 146 ***** |


NT|^B@2
There are three losing Hearts here and that will make the contract "tight". After that we have to avoid a trump loser. So you need to focus on that as the opponents are cashing their tricks in Hearts.|

Now, how should you tackle trumps? You have nine between you so are missing four cards. In point of fact, you have no finesse position available so you really have little choice...|

PG| ***** 155 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The fall of West's @S10 has opened up a new possibility for you. Although your original Plan should have been to cash the @SA K hoping to drop the @SQ singleton or doubleton you now have a finesse available.|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
You could, if you choose, play off the @SK (hoping Spades are 2-2) or, alternatively, you could cross to dummy and run the @SJ, playing the @S10 to be singleton (and East to hold @SQ 5 4).|
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


NT||lb|*mWhich play offers you the greater chance?^Play Spade King~Finesse^1|
PC|sk|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The difference in odds between taking the finesse and playing for the drop is miniscule, as the author states. However (ladies take note), if you have good intuition and decide finessing the queen is right, that would be fine.|
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also, on this hand you have no information about the defenders' distribution. But if you did, that might help you decide how to play the hand. For example, if you knew that East started out with 4 hearts (you don't know that), then you know one more card in East's hand then West's hand. Therefore the odds are even better (although only slightly) that West has a 2nd spade. |
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Similarly, if you knew that West started with 4 hearts (which you don't) then it is slightly more likely that East has the SQ and you should finesse. Of course, on this hand West started out with 4 hearts and the SQ so my theory does not work out. But the point is, the odds may change when you have more information about the hand.

But on this hand, I recommend that the ladies use their intuition and us poor men just play the odds.|pc|sqs6s5|
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


sk||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|With the @SQ falling the rest of the hand is pianola. You have tricks to burn. You couldn't go off now if you threw the cards against a wall and played them as they fell.|mc|10|
PG| ***** 162 ***** |


UP|24|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|You would have plenty of tricks if West led a Spade, a Diamond or a Club but your evil-minded left-hand opponent unerringly finds your weak spot with the @hA lead. East enthusiastically encourages with the @h9 so the defenders have three tricks in the bag before you can blink.|
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now, at least this is an easy hand to analyze. Simply put, you need to pull in the trump suit without loss. You have nine trumps without any finesse available so you have to hope the @SQ falls in one or two rounds.|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So you lead off the @SA and… West drops the @S10. This opens up an intriguing possibility as you now have a finesse position in trumps. You could cross to dummy and run the @SJ, playing West for the singleton @S10 and East for @SQ 5 4.|
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So which is more likely? That West was dealt @SQ 10 doubleton or the singleton @S10? The odds are close but it is fractionally better (a couple of percentage points) to play off the @SK hoping for an original 2-2 break. That works here and the rest of the hand is child’s play.|
PG| ***** 166 ***** |


NT|^B@2
(If you hate statistics and probability you might skip this paragraph. Still, it is interesting…Honest!) Players are often confused when they look at a table of odds. A 3-1 break (50%) is more likely than a 2-2 break (40%), even if that in itself is counter-intuitive. Here, having cashed the @SA and seen the @S10 why shouldn’t we take the Spade finesse as the 3-1 break is more likely than a 2-2 break?|
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Good Question! Well done for asking it (!) The answer is that the odds change with every card played. Once the @SA has bought forth the @S10 (LHO) and the @S4 (RHO) it is no longer possible that Spades are 4-0 nor that they are 3-1 with the singleton @SQ. The odds now say that the remaining cards are more likely to break 1-1 than not – although it is close.|
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So, by following the original plan of cashing the @SA K you bring home the bacon in 4@S.|

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding: Over (1@D) - Pass - (1@H) - to you, there should be no need to mess around with a Double. With both opponents bidding, there is hardly any chance for there to be a slam. Sure, 3@S could be the highest contract that you can make but no need to be pessimistic. If partner has @SQ x then all we need is for the @HK to be onside to make game! Play: The defense starts out with @DK, @DA, and diamond to East's queen in which you ruff. What next? |
PG| ***** 194 ***** |


AT|

Careful! After ruffing the diamond at trick three, the proper play at trick four is the @HQ! Yes, you read correctly. |
PG| ***** 195 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you cross to the @SQ to take a heart finesse and it loses, you will not be able to get back to dummy to enjoy the @HJ. If you play the @HA then @HQ and East has six hearts to the king, East will be able to return a heart for West to ruff while the opponents still have trumps in their hand.|
PG| ***** 196 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So let's say we play out the @HQ at trick 4 and East has the dreaded six hearts to the king. He wins the @HK and shifts to a club. You win the Ace, cash both major suit aces and then enter dummy with a spade to discard your club loser on the @HJ. |
PG| ***** 197 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Your play of the @HQ only loses when West has two hearts and three spades. However, it wins whenever hearts are 5-3 regardless of who has the king. The play of the heart suit reminds me of a story I tell to my classes. |
PG| ***** 198 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Two ladies are discussing how their husbands play bridge and the first says, "My husband is the worst bridge player on the planet." |

PG| ***** 200 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The first one then says, "O.K, let me tell you what happened last night. My husband was playing 7NT with 11 tricks outside of spades. The dummy had the @SA Q and the king was onside. My husband took the first 11 tricks, somehow wound up in DUMMY with the @SA Q, and then led the queen from the dummy!" |

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Against East's 3NT, you lead the @S7, the time-honored fourth best from your longest and strongest. Upon seeing dummy's weakness in Spades, you hope that partner can either contribute the @SA or the @SQ (or both) to help establish your suit. |
PG| ***** 221 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As luck would have it, your partner, normally such a disappointment, surprises you with the @SA. Not only that, but he also returns the @S9 to declarer's @S10 and your @SJ. As you cash the @SK, dropping declarer's @SQ, you can deduce that your remaining @S8 2 have become winners. To confirm that, you can do a quick recount of the number of Spades played after the third trick.|
PG| ***** 222 ***** |


NT|^B@2
When partner wins the opening lead with the @SA and returns a Spade to your Jack, you can see that dummy, partner and declarer have contributed six Spade cards in total. You started off with five Spades, so there remain only two Spades (there are only thirteen Spades in the deck, remember...)|
