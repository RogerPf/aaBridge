NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Kia has 3 choices of bids. He can bid 1@S—as "advancer" (responder to overcaller) that generally shows 5 spades. He can decide he has a 6-9 raise and bid 2@H as he did. Or he can treat his hand as a limit raise and bid 2@C. Personally I would bid 2@C. He has 9 HCP, 1 length point and 1 point for the doubleton = 11 dummy points. Not to mention his shortness is in my suit and he has no points in my suit, both of which are a plus.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Jenny made the correct lead. even if you play top of nothing, if leading partner's unsupported suit, you lead ^*Bcount not attitude^*N. Count is almost always more important than attitude in partner's suit if you have not supported partner. Had Jenny supported clubs (not that she should on this hand) then her correct lead would be the @C10. Because since support promises 3+ cards, I would not mistake the 10 for a doubleton.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the point is, on defense I had to come up with a plan to take 6 tricks. I knew from my spade holding that whatever spade holding Wasim had, the spades were favorably placed. And I was worried that diamonds would be pitched on either the @CQ if Wasim had it, or the spades. So I had to adopt an aggressive defense and lead a diamond. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most people are uncomfortable with an aggressive defense and tend to defend in a way that is passive and does not give away tricks. And passive defense is often correct. The trick is to know when to be aggressive on defense. As with many play problems, that comes with counting and deducing.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I felt that if Jenny did not have the @DK we did not have much of a chance to beat the hand. Unfortunately she did not have it on this hand. But on hands where she did have it, we would have beaten the hand.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most defenders would have been reluctant to lead away from @DAJ. This same sort of thing came up yesterday for those who watched me in the lilypad game. There was a hand where the @CQ was in dummy  and I held @CKx. I felt the only way to beat the hand was to play the @CK and hope partner had the @CA and could give me a ruff. On that hand my play worked and I ended up beating the hand where many declarers made the hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I got lucky here. Wasim should have kept diamonds and discarded clubs as it turned out, but often it is unclear what to keep. However, in general a good defensive principle is to "keep parity" with dummy. That means when dummy has a long suit, you should keep at least as many cards as dummy in that suit. Wasim should keep 4 diamonds. |
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, the main point on this hand was that I planned it out at trick 1. I had to decide at trick 1 which hand to win the club in. That was one important key to the hand. You should always get in the habit of planning the hand. Even if your plan is flawed it is better than having no plan.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Double with your hand is not an acceptable bid. You will be showing spades and diamonds. What are you going to do when partner bids diamonds—2@D. In that case, you will have to bid 2N. Not to mention that a "double and correct" to NT shows 19 since a 1NT overcall shows 15-18.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Admittedly it is annoying to have to pass with an opener. We could easily have a heart fit and you could easily have a spade fit. With a third diamond, double would be ok. But I think with only a small doubleton diamond, your best bid is a reluctant pass. Had I opened 1@D, Kia has a clear double.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |

As you all know, I hate to pass. but the trick is that sometimes it is right. Most people do pass too much. They need to bid more, but sometimes (rarely :)) pass is right.|

^c@2a) Wasim has no diamonds in which case the hand is cold even if she has 4 clubs to the QJ, or

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|It's possible that partner has led from a poor Diamond suit but more likely is that this is a fourth-highest lead. Let's assume that it is. 

Applying the Rule of Eleven... 11 - 6 = 5. We can see four cards higher than the @D6 in dummy and our own hand. Thus, declarer has one card that outranks the @D6. How does that help?|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|East-West bid to 3NT by West and this is an easy deal to defend. Easy when you see all four hands, that is…

North leads the @D6, calls for the @D8 from table. How should you defend?|
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Well, the first point is that this is not a deal where you should finesse against the dummy and play the @D10. True there are many (very many) deals where that would be the right play. Not this one, though.|
PG| ***** 162 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Why not? Let’s apply the Rule of Eleven. 11 – 6 = 5; we can see four higher Diamonds than the @D6 so declarer has exactly one higher Diamond. Could it be the @DA? Not really – how many declarers do you know who, faced with @DA × × opposite @DQ 8 would coldly call for dummy’s EIGHT? So the logical conclusion is that declarer does not have the @DA.|
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Right, having jumped the first hurdle and won the @DK we have to return a Diamond – but which Diamond? A lazy @D5 will block the suit. The correct return, naturally, is the @D10. If declarer has @DJ × × then partner will duck this (he knows we don’t have the @DJ, of course) and maybe the contract will go off anyway. |
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As the cards lie, North-South can take six tricks off the reel, defeating 3NT before it gets going.

Footnote. This deal appeared in a simultaneous pairs. 3NT was rarely defeated and made overtricks on the vast majority of tables.|

^B@2^*BMM: All the declarer needed was an error by South playing @D10 instead of @DK ^*N|
