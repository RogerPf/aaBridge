Let me count my Bergen points—16 HCP - 1 for CQx + 1 length point + 1 quality suit point = 17. a bare min, using Bergen count, for a reverse. But rather than bidding 2@S I will bid 2N invitational. That provides less information. I know we don't have a spade fit sine pard did not bid 1@S.|mb|2N|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very good. Had Valerie decided to keep 3 diamonds Carol would have unluckily been down 1. But that was because everything was unfavorable. Had hearts broken 3-3, or Valerie had 4 hearts, or Judy had the @DA, there would be no way to beat the hand the way it was played. So the hand was played correctly and luckily the opponents discarded incorrectly as they often do.|

PG| ***** 23 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is no dilemma. You always have a doubleton unless you are 4-3-3-3. When you have a hand too strong to open 1N and not strong enough to open 2N, you open 1 of a minor planning to rebid 2N (18-19).|UB||

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, one could argue that using Bergen points you should subtract 1 for Jx of spades and therefore only have 17. Someone mentioned that Bergen bids 1N with certain 18 HCP.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not sure what he would do with this hand. It only has 17 adjusted HCP but it has 4 quick tricks which is well above average for a 17 point hand. I suggest in general just use HCP when making NT opening decisions. It is easier for us mortals who are not as smart as Marty.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We already discussed the bidding. Let's discuss the play. First the opening lead. In general, I try to avoid leading suits the opponents have bid, even if they open 1 of a minor. Even when they open 1@C, 85% of the time opener has at least 4 clubs. As a general rule I would avoid leading clubs and spades with East's hand.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, Valerie has no good choices as to what to lead. If I had bid 1@H rather than 1@S I might lead a spade. But since we bid the black suits, if she doesn't want to lead one of our bid suits, she has to pick a red suit and both @HQx and @DJxx are bad holdings to lead. So I probably still choose a club as she did, but would not be surprised if it didn't work out that well.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As declarer you should always count your winners. Off the top, Judy has 1 spade,|HC|SA|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


AT| 2 hearts,|HC|HAK|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


AT| 2 diamonds,|HC|DAK|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


AT| and 2 clubs (once a club is led).|HC|CAQ|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


AT| That is 7 tricks. It is pretty easy to see how to get 2 more tricks so long as diamonds are 3-2 (68%) Judy can establish 2 more diamond winners for a total of 4 enough to make 3N.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, after winning the club, start the diamonds. if they break 3-2 everything is great. If not, she can then come up with plan B. But on this hand plan A works just fine. Again, always count your winners before playing a card from dummy. Come up with a plan to take enough winners to make your contract.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|let me discuss my 4@H bid first. We are certainly going to end up in at least 4 hearts. But it is possible we have slam since I have such a nice hand after the heart overcall. |
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The alternative bids I can make are 2@D (limit+ raise) and 4@C (splinter) although it is unlikely we have slam (I really have to discount my @DK once west opens 1@D).
jordymil:  so a splinter can be made as advancer to overcaller?|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT|^B@2  
lukie2too:  what about Jacoby 2NT?|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You can't bid Jacoby 2NT when partner overcalls. 2NT after an overcall is not Jacoby. It is natural, usually showing an opener. So I decided to just bid 4@H which is probably where we should play on most layouts. |
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But on further reflection I think 4@C is a better bid. 2@D is not incorrect, but I really don't want to give the opps room to compete and 4@C gets my hand across better than 2@D since it should show at least an opener with a singleton club.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, on this auction, Judy should hate my 4@C bid. the @CKQ do not fit well with club shortness. Take Judy's same HCP but make the @CKQ the @SKQ. now 6 hearts has plays—needs a 1-1 heart break.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So whenever partner splinters, you should love having 3 or 4 small or 3 or 4 to the ace. Any other honors in partner's short suit are actually detriments and should be discounted.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the defense, Carol should play the @DJ at trick 1 as it turns out, Judy has the @DQ. But playing the @DJ does not cost a trick and if pard had the @DQ, playing the @DA would cost their side a diamond trick, since the @DK would be set up.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Generally speaking, when possible, use your aces to capture the opponents' honors. In particular, when you have 2 honors "surrounding" 1 honor, as on this hand, play the lower honor. As it turns out, the @DA is a better defense if West now follows through. There is no reason to cash the @CA. It is not going anywhere.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|At trick 2, if west leads a spade, that works out better. On this hand, since Judy only has a doubleton spade it doesn't matter, but if Judy had 3 spades it would matter. As it turns out, Judy always makes 4 against any defense.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We discussed the bidding. The hand is a little tricky and was played well. West has to make sure to ruff a club loser and play diamonds correctly. So after drawing 2 rounds of trump, she has to keep a spade in dummy to ruff a club. And, although based on the auction it looks very likely that the diamond finesse is working, it is barely possible that I have the singleton diamond queen (but only if the person who opened a weak 2 is one of my students who opens with 10xxxxx :) ).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Valerie has a good 2@C bid here. One could make a case for a redouble as well. Remember 2@C denies 10 points, it simply shows a nice suit. I would not hate redouble, but 2@C takes up more room. On this auction it is natural and over the double, is less than 10. With 10 or more you redouble.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So remember that a bid at the 2-level over a takeout double denies 10 points. As far as the play goes the idea on this type of hand, is to score as many low trump as you can which is what North did and ended up scoring enough low trump to make the hand.|
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Perhaps they could make 2N. It depends on how it is played and the defense. If north leads a diamond, it could be hard as North/South can take 3 diamonds and 3 spades and a heart.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|You have no guaranteed entry to your hand so you must overtake this diamond in order to cash your @DA.
 
If diamonds are 3-3 then overtaking does no harm, but if diamonds are 4-2 (with partner having the doubleton) then you must overtake the diamond to cash the third diamond trick (else you may lose it altogether).|pc|dkd3|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|You now have taken three tricks and need to find one more. What's your plan?|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


NT||lb|*yCan partner have a side ace?^^n|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|No, that is practically impossible. Our partner has already shown up with the @DQ J and adding an extra ace would not give enough points for declarer to have accepted the invitational 3@S bid (we have 11 points, dummy also has 11 points, partner has shown up with @DQ J and along with an ace would give 7 points, leaving declarer with 11 points which is not enough to have accepted the invite).|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, the one suit that we definitely should not return is a club as declarer must have the @CA and would run our club round to dummy's queen. What about the @HK, can partner hold that card?|
pg| ***** 135 ***** |


NT||lb|*yCan partner hold HK?^^y|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Sure, that might be possible. If partner's @HK were to make a trick then we'd have to hope that declarer holds @HA x. But do we really need to return a heart if declarer does indeed have @HA x?|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If declarer has @HA x then the 4@S contract is down automatically if we return a spade, a heart, or a club (since declarer does not have an available winner in dummy to discard a heart from hand, and will eventually fall back on the failing heart finesse).|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


NT|^B@2
What if instead we return a diamond? Would that also beat the contract if declarer has @HA x? What if declarer has a singleton @HA instead?

There are a few things to think about here - try and go through each combination carefully before continuing on with the defense.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|That's our fourth trick. Down one.
 
Declarer had some amazing luck in the club suit (taking two finesses through us) but it still wasn't enough, thanks to our trump promotion.
 
Declarer has the rest.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding: The opponents have had an invitational auction up to 4@S. |
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Play: On the @DQ lead you signal for encouragement with the @D8. Your partner continues with the @DJ in which you overtake in order to cash the @DA. The main reason for overtaking is that you have no guaranteed entry to your hand to cash the @DA. |
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If diamonds are 3-3 then no harm is done, but if diamonds are 4-2 (with partner having the doubleton) then you would have to overtake the diamond else you might see your third diamond trick run away! |
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


NT|^B@2
After cashing the third diamond and seeing the suit break 3-3-3 around the table, what should you return? A fourth diamond! Playing a fourth diamond gives you the best chance to defeat the contract - thanks to the lovely @SJ x x in your hand (you hope to promote a trump trick). |
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you are afraid of declarer holding @HA x and gets to discard a heart, then fear not. If declarer discards a heart, then he will be forced to ruff with one of dummy's spade honors but then your @SJ will have been promoted. We are effectively trading a heart winner for a spade winner.|
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, returning a diamond also gains when declarer has the singleton @HA (as in the actual deal). Declarer can ruff our fourth diamond in hand with the @S9, but luckily our partner is there for us to overruff declarer with the @S10, which will then, in turn, force dummy to "over-overruff". This will promote our @SJ.|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Even if partner has the @S9 with declarer holding @SK 10 8 x x x, he will have to guess which spade to ruff the diamond with in order to prevent a trump promotion.  The worst that can happen is that declarer can ruff high enough in his own hand to prevent partner from upper-cutting dummy. And if that happens you have lost nothing as declarer still remains with whatever loser(s) he had. |
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you return anything other than a diamond, declarer, if sufficiently inspired, can use both spade entries to dummy to take the double club finesse and land the contract. The bottom line: Consider the "uppercut" of dummy's trump holding as a means of promoting a potential trump trick.|

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|On this deal, you will need to make a desperation play. When all hopes appear to be slim, never give up but keep fighting!|
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


NT||lb|*bWhat would you bid for South^^1N|MB|1NP3NPPP|
pg| ***** 163 ***** |


PC|H4|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Interesting hand. Funnily enough, you and dummy have a mirrored distribution (i.e. you have the exact hand shape of 3.3.4.3)! The curiosity moment is over, and it's time to plan your play.|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BWhich one is it?: ^*N|cp||at|With three top tricks in both major suits and two top Clubs, you have a nice eight top tricks to begin with. All that's left to do is to find just one more trick! 

Any ideas?|
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Spades are out, Hearts are out, Clubs is wishful thinking, and Diamonds look so weak and filthy. It might first appear that we have no hope, but there is only one suit that we can work with. Which one is it?|
PG| ***** 166 ***** |


NT||lb|*mWhich one is it?^Clubs~Diamonds~Hearts~Spades^2|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|It's the Diamond suit. Although we do not have the strength (i.e. suit quality) in the suit, but we do have the length. Given enough time, we can continually play on Diamonds and eventually establish a trick there when the opponents are exhausted of Diamonds. 

How do we want the Diamonds to split in order to set up a Diamond trick?|
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


NT||lb|*mHow do we want the Diamonds to split?^5-0~4-1~3-2^3|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|With an eight-card fit in Diamonds, we must hope that the Diamonds split 3-2.

Good luck!|

PG| ***** 183 ***** |


up|29|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|You land in (yet another) 3NT after a very swift auction. West leads the @H4 and at first you might think your contract's prospects are bleak. With three top tricks in Spades and Hearts, and two top Clubs, where could your ninth trick possibly come from? |
PG| ***** 184 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Generating an extra trick in Spades, Hearts or Clubs is pretty much impossible, so you are left with your ugly looking Diamond suit. It's not all bad news though. You have an eight-card fit in Diamonds, and if Diamonds split 3-2, you have some hope of setting up a Diamond trick. |
PG| ***** 185 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, because you need to give up the lead three times in Diamonds, you need to get started on the Diamond suit as soon as possible. |
PG| ***** 186 ***** |


NT|^B@2
After winning the Heart lead (in either hand), you should immediately play out a Diamond. Whichever opponent wins the trick will probably return a Heart in which case you will win it and play out another Diamond.|
PG| ***** 187 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The opponents will probably persist with the - um - Heart-attack, whereupon you play yet another Diamond. Sooner or later, you will collect your "long" Diamond trick and make your 3NT contract. 

Sometimes you don't have the strength (suit quality), but having length can also generate tricks for you. |
