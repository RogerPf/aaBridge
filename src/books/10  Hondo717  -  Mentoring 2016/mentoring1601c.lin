With five hearts, opener rebids 3@H. With five spades, opener rebids 3@S. With four hearts or four spades (or both), opener rebids 3@D. If Claire had no major she would bid 3N.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people do play Puppet over 1N. However, those who do usually use 3@C as Puppet with a game forcing hand and 2@C as regular Stayman. If you play 2@C Puppet then you have a big problem with an invitational hand when responder has no 4-card major. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I won't do this here. but Marty Bergen might say, on this auction, especially given the vulnerability, I should bid 2@S. He has a whole system named "OBAR - Over Opponents Bid And Raise" which is predicated on what he calls pre-balancing. He says once it starts 1@H-P-2@H or 1@S-P-2@S, you should strain to bid in direct seat. And partner should not assume you have many values. Just that you are competing. On this deal it probably makes no difference.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Claire passed 1@D so she can't have 6 HCP. On the surface, I have 1 spade loser, 1 diamond loser, and 2 potential club losers, but once Claire plays the @SK, I am sure Ben has the @CA because Claire would not pass with 7 HCP.

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One more point to discuss. As Claire knows (she has played with and against me for a long time :) ) I would not pass 1@D with her hand. As far as I am concerned my 2 choices are 1@S or 3@D. But even if she bids 3@D as a preemptive tactic I still bid 3@H and presumably Ed bids 4@H with his singleton diamond and 4-card support. However 3@D does make it much harder for us to find our game.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is an interesting point and 2@S would be good choice, but on this auction Ben might not have 4 spades (although he will more often than not).

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The most important thing is to have a style with which you are comfortable. Claire is a very consistent player and, so long as she and her partner agree to style, her rule is fine. No matter which style you choose, on some hands it will not work out. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Similarly, 3@H would show a limit raise or better in spades, but 3@S over 2N would show a good spade suit but is not forcing. It shows around 10 or 11 points. Last but not least, a double is for penalty.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|To summarize, cue bids of the 2NTrumper's suits, show good hands. Double is penalty. Other bids are not forcing. On this hand I would bid 3@H with Ben's hand showing a game forcing hand with spades playing unusual over unusual. I am not suggesting you play this, as it is somewhat involved. Usually you can make other reasonable bids not playing unusual over unusual.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I will lead another heart in case she has a singleton, but I doubt she does because she probably would have led a singleton heart on opening lead. Again, you need to take both positive and negative inferences from the play of the cards.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A "negative" inference is a conclusion based on what a player did not do. The famous example I use is the Sherlock Holmes story where he solves the mystery because the "dog did NOT bark." Here, because Claire did not lead a heart on opening lead, and she likely would with a singleton I don't think she has one.|pc|HJ|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A little unlucky for Ben. He hoped for a 3-2 break in spades. However on any hands where the opponents preempt or show distributional hands, bad breaks are more likely especially when you have an 8 card fit. 3-2 normally occur a little over 2/3 of the time. But on hands where there are preempts the odds go down significantly. |
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not sure I can state with certainty, but I would say that if you wanted to assume a 3-2 break around 60% of the time or even less, that would not be unreasonable.|

A second (almost hidden) chance is that Diamonds break 4-3 and you can set up the thirteenth Diamond for a Club discard. This will require a good number of entries to dummy. It is therefore essential that you win the trump lead in your hand and play a diamond immediately.|

There are only two ways to get rid of losers. We can trump them in dummy, or dump them in dummy. The great news is that we've got the @DK Q in dummy to dump two losers on. The secret will be timing. Do we want to pull trumps first? (Hint: How many tricks do you want to go down?)|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|We are delighted when our partner opens the bidding, and we strongly suspect we're going to be in Hearts. When Pard shows a minimum hand with flat distribution, we go for our Heart game. |
PG| ***** 192 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Our Count and Plan reveals five losers: one Spade, one Heart and maybe three Clubs. We know that we need to find a place to trump losers in dummy, or dump in dummy. We've got the @DK Q to use as a dumping ground, so our contract is safe. |
PG| ***** 193 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Normally when we are going to dump in dummy, we pull trumps first, but on this hand, that would be a real Kamikaze move.|
PG| ***** 194 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So many things we can do wrong. The first is trick 1. We need to take that in the closed hand with the @SK so we can briskly play the @DA to unblock at trick 2.|
PG| ***** 195 ***** |


AT|  At trick 3, we zoom up to the dummy with the @SA, and plop two losers on the @DK Q.|
PG| ***** 196 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Our next move is to get back to the closed hand by ruffing a Spade (remembering to ruff high just in case...). Now and only now can we take our (sure to fail) Heart finesse. |
PG| ***** 197 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It does fail (quelle surprise), so we sit tight while They take Their two Club tricks. Then the rest are ours. |
PG| ***** 198 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Just for fun, look at what would have happened had you pulled trumps first. They would have taken three Clubs, one Spade and the Heart. Whew. |
