^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are a couple of issues to discuss before the auction ends. If you play Texas Transfer (e.g. 4@D is transfer to 4@H) it should still be on after an overcall. So if West normally plays Texas Transfer she should have bid 4@D. No big deal, and obviously 4@H would not be mistaken as spade transfer. On the other hand, 4@H is actually a good bid. That way there is no confusion.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 2nd issue is North should consider bidding 4@S. Over 4@H, when you have a 9+ card fit, 4@S is right more often than not. We let the pass by North stand,, but will discuss how 4@S does after the hand. Probably not well. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@S goes down a lot, but that is because you can actually make 6 with the EW cards. Having said that most people will not get to 6. In 4@S I lose 2 hearts, 1 diamond, 3 clubs, and 1 spade for down 4—probably doubled. This is a case, assuming they let us play 4@S (but West, with the void should pull the double) where 4@S over 4@H would not work out.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But, even if East doubles 4@S West should pull with the void. Voids are magic on offense and a detriment on defense. So we would probably not end up in 4@S doubled.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With the void, should West think about 6?|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


AT|  It is a so-so contract. You have to hope North has the @DJ and diamonds are 3-2. BTW, the best way to play the diamonds is to lead low towards the @DQ first. When that wins lead low from West and when North plays low, put up the @D10 (since South is now known to have the @DA).|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Considering the proper diamond play, 6 should be made as it turns out. Its not a great 6 but it makes. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West has 16 Declarer Points—9 HCP, 2 length points, 4 for the void and 1 for the side 4 card diamond suit. It certainly is enough to consider slam although East needs 17 Dummy Points for the needed 33 points. So I think 4@H is a perfectly good place to play. but its close.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is barely possible that pard has 4 hearts, though very unlikely. So they have a 9+ card heart fit and we have a 9+ card spade fit. Will they get to 4@H? |sk||

AT| I am not sure. But if I bid 3@S, which is the official Law of Total Tricks bid, they will bid 4@H. They might not, but they probably will.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if I bid 4@S right away (assuming I was intending to bid 4@S over 4@H which I would for sure at any other vul) that makes it harder for them to figure out what is going on. And in fact, unless West has a clear double, it is likely they will bid 5@H because they have favorable vul and would not know for sure if we could make 4@S. That is why 4@S is a good bid even at this vul.|mb|4S|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is an example of how you should try and play defense. You must try and figure out what declarer has when you can, based on the clues from the bidding.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Can West do better?|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


AT| With 3-1 hearts I am not sure she can ever make 5. There is a sure club loser and a sure spade loser. If she chooses to ruff 2 spades, there is a heart loser. And if she tries to set up clubs by ruffing 3 rounds of clubs, then North will get her @HJ on the 4th round of clubs.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I think the best that can be done is to play a club at trick 3, and try and ruff 3 clubs hoping that hearts are 2-2. If they are then West will only lose 2 tricks, 1 club and 1 spade. But since they are 3-1, 4@H is the best that can be made.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So my 4@S bid did its job and forced them to an unmakeable contract. They could double 4@S but they might not even be beating it. As it is, we lose 1 spade 1 heart and 2 diamonds. just down 1
hondo717: and if partner does not have the @SJ, we would make it.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So 5@H was the bid I would have made with the West hand. It turns out to be wrong, but when the opponents jam the auction, it is often not possible to make the best decision. You have to go with the odds. With a singleton spade and great hearts, 5@H is the best bid.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is right in 2 of 3 scenarios. The 2 scenarios it is right are when you can make 5@H (which is your best scenario) or we can make 4@S. The only time it is wrong is when we can't make 4@S and you can't make 5@H. That happens to be the case on this hand, because of the @SJ in the East hand.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But there is no way to know that. So 5@H will work out most of the time. Also, as I said this also illustrates why aggressive bidding pays off because it often forces the opps to make a decision which might turn out to be wrong.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people would open my hand. and that would not be a terrible idea. I do have 3 "quick tricks" -- 2 in diamonds and 1 in hearts |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=quicktricks^*N|CP||AT|. One way of deciding if your hand is better than its HCP indicates is to compare it to what I call "Quick Trick Points."|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are 40 HCP and 8 quick tricks (2 in each suit). 40 divided by 8 is 5 so each quick trick is the equivalent of around 5 points. So my 3 quick tricks are worth 15 Quick Trick" Points.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If your Quick Trick Points are higher than your actual points (as in this case) then you can upgrade your hand. If your Quick Trick Points are less than your HCP (say for example you had 15 HCP but only 2 quick tricks) then you should down grade your hand.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Basically what this method does is make up for the inaccuracies of the 4-3-2-1 point count system by valuing aces and kings more. However, I am still a big believer in the rule of 20. And I have found that I don't like to open balanced 11 counts. It works out badly more often than it works out well.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So particularly in 1st and 2nd seat I don't open balanced 11 counts. I would open this hand in 3rd seat which admittedly does violate my normal style of only opening rule of 20 hands. But the Quick Trick Points justify the 3rd seat opening. I would not open my hand in 4th seat, however.|mb|p|sk||

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@D over 1N would not be a bad call. But back to the 2@H bid. If East had better hearts then 2@H would be better. However, with a weakish 6 card suit and very nice 2 card spade support, I like East's choice of bidding 2@S.|

Admittedly leading any of the other 3 suits could cause problems as well. But I probably lead the @DQ hoping that it is the best lead and that I might get a ruff since there is a good chance I win the 2nd spade with my @SK based on the auction.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out I don't win the 2nd spade, but the @DQ turns out to be the best lead. However, had I bid 2@D, which I should have at this vul, the @DQ would have been the clear lead.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Assuming normal breaks, North's hand is worth around 7 tricks, 5 spades and 2 aces, plus a possible 2nd diamond trick.

jordymil:  Can you explain why 3@S isn't a preempt, please?|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@S is not a preempt because you should not preempt a preempt. The idea behind a preempt is to make it hard for your opponents to bid when they have the majority of the points.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West has 7 tricks in her hand for sure with a spade lead. If partner has the @HA she has 10 tricks. if partner has some club cards you have 9 tricks. Remember there are very few hands where 5 of a minor makes and 3N does not. 9 tricks is almost always much easier to take than 3N.|ub||

PG| ***** 121 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Sometimes you should double and correct, but only if you have no better alternative. You should be reluctant to do so. In this hand there were better alternatives to double and correct.|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes West should be a little worried about Kx of spades, but playing "scared bridge" is counter productive. It is a stopper, and there is a good chance she can make 3N, so that is the best bid. Good bridge is all about "risk/reward." It is ok to take a risk if the reward justifies it.|
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case bidding 3N is fairly low risk because it will make most of the time. Sure sometimes it will go down, but you can't worry about that. You need to be an optimistic bidder.|

^B@2^*BBarry Rigal: ^*N|cp||at|If your side plays support doubles, so that a double of 1@S would show three trumps, then a raise to 2@H shows four trumps.
 
This is very important for judging the degree of fit. But: a word of caution. These methods work better with strong no-trump (with a weak no-trump base it seems to me right to play these doubles as strong no-trump values with an unsuitable stopper).|

^B@2^*BBarry Rigal: ^*N|cp||at|With a nine-card trump fit you would normally compete to 3@H - if not confidently, at any rate with a fair degree of enthusiasm.
 
Your weak trumps are a drawback, but as against that you do not have much in their suit either. The advantage of bidding on is that it gives them the last decision.|mb|3h|

^B@2^*BBarry Rigal: ^*N|cp||at|South has a standard response of 1@H to the opening 1@C bid, and when North freely raises to 2@H then, even if not playing support Doubles, South will expect to find his partner with either four-card trump support or an unbalanced hand with three trumps. So when his opponents compete to 2@S, South should bid 3@H for two reasons. |
PG| ***** 178 ***** |


NT|^b@2
In the first place, one side or the other is likely to have nine trumps, and will probably make nine tricks. In the second place, South’s relatively weak three-card spade suit is likely to be opposite shortage, and thus his side’s values should fit well together.|
PG| ***** 179 ***** |


NT|^b@2
North-South get to buy the hand in 3@H, and on the lead of the @S10 South can see that he has two top trump losers, and a club, and he may have to lose two diamonds. Is there anything he can do to avoid going one down if the diamonds are unfriendly? |
PG| ***** 180 ***** |


NT|^b@2
The answer is yes, but declarer must start off by taking the first trick and leading a diamond to the ten, to establish a home for his club loser. West wins the @DQ and shifts to a club, too late! |
PG| ***** 181 ***** |


NT|^b@2
South takes the @CK and plays the @DK, and West captures this with the @DA and leads a second club. South wins in dummy and plays off the @DJ, throwing his last club away. Now a low heart to the ten would be fatal (the defense can promote the @H9 on the third round of clubs). Instead South leads the @HQ, and West wins and plays a spade. |
PG| ***** 182 ***** |


NT|^b@2
South ruffs in dummy and comes to hand with a club ruff to trump his last spade high, then leads the @HJ, and has the rest of the tricks after East takes his @HA. 

Finally, did you notice East violated the LOTT by not bidding 3@S, a contract that would be an easy make?|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding. We open 1@S on a workaday hand and partner responds 1NT. Well, it’s normally right to show the second suit in these positions so we rebid 2@H, hoping that partner might like these.|
PG| ***** 209 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Like them? Partner startles us with an exuberant leap to 4@H – and this on a hand limited by 6-9 points. Wow! We are playing in a game contract with a combined total of (at most) 22 points. We await dummy with some trepidation.|
PG| ***** 210 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Play. Ah! So that’s what partner has! He was depressed when you bid 1@S (a probable misfit was on the cards) but cheered up when you bid 2@H on the second time around. With six trumps and an Ace partner thought he had enough for a shot at game. One thing’s for sure – had he bid 3@H we’d have Passed. Quickly.|
PG| ***** 211 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Counting tricks we see that we have six Hearts (assuming trumps break 2-1) and the @DA K. That’s eight. We can also trump two Clubs in our own hand – and that will give us eight trump tricks and two Diamonds. Wow, on a combined 20 points, we are going to score a game…|
PG| ***** 212 ***** |


NT|^b@2
West leads the @CJ and continues the suit. We ruff and draw trumps in two rounds. We cross to the @DA to ruff the last Club and then try for an overtrick by playing on Diamonds. If they were 3-3 we’d only lose one Diamond and one Club. Not today but we still have ten tricks and game. It seems that partner was right to bid 4@H.|
