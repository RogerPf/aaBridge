^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Pass would be reasonable by me. There is some chance of a misfit because of my spade length. However, there is also some chance that we have a heart fit. Noah must be short in spades which makes it more likely he has some hearts. So I am going to make a negative double, and if Noah bids 2@D I plan to bid 2@H.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This "Negative Double and Correct" shows a hand too weak to bid 2@H directly. It basically shows a weakish weak 2 in hearts.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to whether Ben should compete, the Law of Total Tricks should be your guide. Although it is possible pard has 6 spades, you should not assume so.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's discuss the bidding. Ben is certainly strong enough to open 1@D with his hand and I would not quarrel if that is what he chose to do. However, in 3rd seat, particularly given his shortness in the majors, opening 2@D is a good tactic with his 6-4 distribution.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|They are not missing game. So opening 2@D makes it harder for NS to bid and they will often make a mistake. For example, I might have chosen to make a balancing double and, although Noah might choose to pass, given I am a passed hand and he is 4-4 in the majors, he might bid 2@H. But I chose to pass and that happened to work out.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to what should Noah do over 2@D? He has several choices, all of which are flawed. He could pass, which is a reasonable alternative, but uncomfortable with his 15 HCP.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|He could bid what I would have bid, 2NT, showing a 15-18 NT hand. I don't like the singleton club, but I feel that 2N gets the hand across better than passing.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Or he could double. That is a bit risky as I might bid clubs. However it is not as risky as you might think. Then I would strain to bid a major, so even with clubs and a major, as I have on this hand, I would bid the major.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's critique the bidding. There were a few problems here. First of all, particularly at this vul, I think Ben should bid 2@H especially given I am a passed hand.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT|^B@2
2nd, if Ben does not bid 2@H, Sanaa should probably bid 1@S rather than 1@D depending on if and how she plays 4th suit forcing.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If 1@S is not 4th suit forcing, just a 1 round force, then bidding 1@D first is ok. But if 1@S is 4th suit forcing then 1@S over 1@C is best to avoid the problem. For this hand we will assume 1@S is forcing but not forcing to game. Some experts play 2@S is 4th suit forcing to game on this auction and 1@S is just natural. That is what we will play here.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The critical point is, you need to not only think about your first bid as responder, but plan out the auction. If 1@S were 4th suit forcing over a 1@H rebid, then to avoid the problem East has to bid 1@S.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Why would you bid 3N Noah? You might bid 2N, but if 1@S is not 4th suit forcing, you have no idea how many points East has.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nicely played Noah. Not sure what Ben should lead. I probably choose a heart hoping pard has something in hearts. A spade with the strength behind me is not as likely to work out as well, but it could be right.|
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As to Noah's bidding analysis, let's dig a little deeper. He has 15 HCP and 1 length point = 16. He has 1 quality suit point = 17. He he has 2 for his 3 aces + 3 tens. That is part of the "adjust 3" rule, where you count up your aces and tens subtract out your queens and jacks. If your aces/tens exceed queens/jacks by 3 you add 1 point. And in the rare case, where it exceeds by 6, you can add 2 points. |
PG| ***** 96 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The idea behind that rule is that, in the normal 4-3-2-1 HCP system aces are undervalued, queens and jacks are overvalued, and tens (which are not counted at all) have some value. So to be more accurate aces should be worth around 4.5 HCP, kings 3 HCP, queens 1.5 HCP, jacks .75 HCP, and tens .25 HCP. |
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, it is very hard to do fractions in your head. so the "adjust 3" rule takes into account that aces and tens are undervalued and queens and jacks are overvalued and is a little easier to calculate. Having said that, that means Noah should either bid 2@H or 2N over 1@D.|

PG| ***** 104 ***** |


NT|^B@2
it is what I call "redundant" bidding. I already promised 4 spades with my negative double. And I have a pretty weak hand. So I already have what I promised with my negative double. There is no reason for me to bid again. Not to mention that the law of total tricks says I have a clear pass.|
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But the most important point is, once you describe your hand, unless further bidding adds to that description, you should not make another bid.And on this hand, negative double says it all. Same thing with Ben. He has a min opening hand with 4 spades. If I had 5 spades I would have bid 3@S. So we have an 8 card fit and the law says I should pass.|

Ben bid 2@S showing 4. I have 4 spades AND dummy has 5 spades. Hence East has none (I will explain more after). So I will lead a heart and sit back and wait for my club trick.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's discuss Sanaa's bidding—NOTE THE CHANGE IN THE BIDDING BOX.|UB|8|
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I personally would have bid 1@H with her hand, as I think she is a bit strong to preempt. However, if she chooses to preempt (and that is not unreasonable), she should go all in and either bid 3@H with her 7 card suit, or even 4@H with her spade void. |MB|4H|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It is very likely we have a spade fit. And there is some chance we only have an 8 or 9 card fit and are getting a bad break—West has 4 or 5 spades.|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now, lets go back to the auction as it went after Ben bid 2@S.|UB|1|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


MB|2HXP2S|
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Over 2@S she chose to bid 3@H.|MB|3H|
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It is not unreasonable given her spade void. However, she needs to consider we did not jump in spades. So we probably don't have a 10 card fit. We either have an 8 card fit or a 9 card fit. And in either case we are getting a bad break.|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Having said that, I still think 3@H is a reasonable call over 2@S, but not as good as it first looks. Had I held the East hand, I bid 1@H. and then if South doubles and North bids 1@S, I know they have an 8 card fit only. Therefore, I (if I was sitting East) might let them play in 2@S with the 5-0 break.|
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This is important to know. |UB|6|
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


AT| Let's say the auction starts (THE BIDS CHANGED AGAIN)|MB|1D1HXP1S|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


AT| as defenders you know for a fact that the opponents have exactly an 8-card fit.|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Why? |
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


AT|South made a negative double showing exactly 4 spades and North did not open 1@S so he must have exactly 4 spades (rarely he will have 5 spades and 6 diamonds but you don't worry about that very rare case).|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


NT|^B@2
brains88:  Doesn't a jump to 2@S promise about 9-10 pts and at least 4 Spades while 1@S is less points, even if you have 5 Spades?|
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No. A negative double of 1@H shows exactly 4 spades. That is all it shows. it is unlimited in terms of HCP. |
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Let me repeat the point. When an opponent makes a negative double over 1@H showing exactly 4 Spades and opener bids spades, you know for sure that the opponents have exactly an 8 card fit. And that can be very useful information when deciding how high to compete.|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Had Sanaa chosen to bid 1@H (instead of 2@H) In fact, if it started then she would know for sure that partner has 5 spades and that might affect her rebids.|

AT| it is not totally unreasonable. There is a good chance North is only taking 2 tricks, and from her perspective it is down 1 at best.|
PG| ***** 184 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Therefore, the risk of having them make and getting a few hundred extra points it not worth the reward of an extra 100 points if it goes down. So I would not double.|

Again, it is ok to make a risky bid or double, but the reward has to outweigh the risk.|

PG| ***** 208 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Well, ducking the Spade is the wrong play, you will give West the tempo to set up the Diamonds. So you take the @SA and switch – not to the “automatic” @HJ (which might jump out of your hand) but to a low Club! We are so conditioned not to lead into tenaces that this defense is curiously difficult to find.|
PG| ***** 209 ***** |


NT|^b@2
However, by playing a Club and another Club when in with the @DQ 3NT is almost certain to fail as we will make two Diamonds, two Clubs and the @SA. Any other defense is sure to let 3NT make.|

NT|^b@2
It’s worthwhile noting that everyone would get this hand right if your hand included @CQ J × × and dummy’s @CA K alone. Somehow, this way round, the winning defense is harder to spot. A case of one point too many?|

So here you are, in a borderline 4@S. You can do nothing while the opponents cash their Club winners. Nonetheless, it's worthwhile making a Plan while this is going on.|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding.
East Passes as dealer and we open 1@S. West makes a thin overcall of 2@C (it’s not usually right to intervene at the two-level on a five-card suit, but we’ll forgive him this time) and partner competes with 2@S.|
PG| ***** 235 ***** |


NT|^b@2
After East Passes we have a problem of evaluation. In terms of high card points, our hand is a bit light for a jump to game. However, we have a marvellous trump suit and partner supported it voluntarily.|
PG| ***** 236 ***** |


NT|^b@2
We decide to take a shot at 4@S, knowing that it is a gamble but hoping that partner's meagre values will be in the right place. True, 4@S is something of an overbid but anything else would be lily-livered.|
PG| ***** 237 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Play.
West cashes the three top Clubs. East throws a Heart on the third of these, shortening himself in that suit. This is something that we need to take heed of in the play.|
PG| ***** 238 ***** |


NT|^b@2
At trick four, West naturally tries his luck with the @DA – after all, that would give him the first four tricks off the reel. We ruff that, though, and take stock.|
PG| ***** 239 ***** |


NT|^b@2
We can only Count eight ricks (six Spades and two Hearts) so the Plan is to ruff two losing Hearts in dummy (in the short trump hand, note) to make the total rise to ten. |
PG| ***** 240 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Planning to ruff Diamonds in the closed hand is just plain silly. We won't increase the number of trump tricks available by that method. Don't ruff in the long trump hand, unless of course, the opponents make it necessary to do so.|
PG| ***** 241 ***** |


NT|^b@2
With that in mind, the Plan is to cash the @HA, the @HK and ruff our low Hearts on table. Care must be taken to ruff the two baby Hearts successively with dummy’s @S8 and @S9. Ruffing with the @S2 would be poor play and would be punished here as East would over-ruff with the lowly @S4.|
PG| ***** 242 ***** |


NT|^b@2
From the days of whist comes an appropriate aphorism:
“Don’t send a boy on a man’s errand”.

We can afford to ruff the losing Hearts with "high" trumps so should certainly do so.|
PG| ***** 243 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Dotting the is and crossing the ts… we ruff one Heart with the @S8, cross to hand with the @S2 to the @S10 and ruff the last Heart with the @S9. Now we only have winning trumps left in the closed hand and the contract is ours.

If you bid 'em up, you have to play 'em well...|
