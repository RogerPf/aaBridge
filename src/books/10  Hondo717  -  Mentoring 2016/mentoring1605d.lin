PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It's close as to whether North should open 2@C or not. Had North opened 2@C, we probably end up in 3N which is a good contract (take 6 clubs and 3 diamonds at least, plus probably at least one trick in a major).|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The general rule for opening 2@C |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=open2c^*N|CP||AT| is if you have 4 quick tricks and 9 tricks. North does meet the criteria in that she has 9.5 tricks (6 clubs, 3 diamonds and perhaps a heart) and 4.5 quick tricks (@CAK @DAK @HK).|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On the other hand, with a minor suit you need to be cautious because the auction starts 2@C-2@D-3@C or 3@D so you are at the 3 level before any natural bidding starts. But all considered, because it was more than a min 2@C opener I probably open 2@C. But opening 1@C is not terrible either.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|^B@2
rosehips:  I thought a double promised 4/4 in the Majors and did not double. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A takeout double of a minor in direct seat almost always shows at least 4-3 in the majors. If you only double with 4-4 in the majors, you will not be able to double on many hands where you should. A takeout double in balancing seat (as on this hand) is even less constrained. So long as you have at least 3 cards in each unbid major, you can and should double. Balancing is designed to get your side into the auction and the balancer can have a wide variety of hands.|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out if West balances we still probably end up in a club partial. So not balancing did not hurt. And making a balance over 1 of a minor is less desirable than making it over 1 of a major because it is possible (although not all that likely) that opener is short in the minor and they could be playing in a 6 or even 5 card fit.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My style is to balance as playing 1@C rarely is a good result. However on this hand, since some will open 2@C it turns out to be the best that E/W can do.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is a conventional double, I don't remember the name, that some people play with the East hand which shows spades. However if you don't play that (and I don't) then it is not clear what East should do.|mb|3D|mb|d|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is the problem now. I made a 3@D LOTT |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=lott^*N|CP||AT| bid. With hearts East would raise hearts or make a support double if they played that. So playing support doubles, which most play, then West cannot double. Not sure what double there should mean.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


AT|
rosehips:  Bid something? Or choose a black suit?|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not clear. Probably just shows values. West is not likely to have diamonds. It is not pure penalty. Just says West has a good hand with no good bid. With a singleton heart and 3 diamonds, I might very well decide to pass with the East hand, particularly since N/S are vul. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We can analyze how 3@D does after the hand. I will also discuss alternative bidding for West, although I think double, assuming it means what I said, is reasonable.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So after winning three heart tricks,|
pc|sks7sqs2|at| then east plays the @SK (showing the SA) and West plays the @SQ (showing the @SJ). That's 4 tricks.|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|They get a club trick and a heart trick for at least for down 2. Thereore, passing the double is the winning bid, and this is a rare hand where LOTT does not work in theory. However in practice it worked out well because they missed their spade game.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Aggressive bidding often works out well in practice even when in theory it does not.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's discuss what else West can bid. Again we need to do a few undos.|up|16|ub|3|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I definitely take a bid over 3@D. With a singleton diamond, 11 HCP and 2 quality suits (for 13 starting points), it is clear to bid. I might just bid 3@S (forcing) figuring that gives us the most flexibility to get to the best contract. It is not clear from West's perspective what the best contract is -- it could be 3N, 4@C, 4@H, 4@S, or 5@C.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So 3@S gives E/W side the most flexiblity to find the best spot. And East would bid 4@S as it turns out.|mb|3sp4sppp|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So sometimes in a competitive auction you have to come up with a bid that has the most upside and I think 3@S is probably that bid on this particular auction. It is not likely to work out too badly.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT|^B@2
veeree:  Can East bid 2@S as W knows its not a reverse?|ub|8|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


mb|2s|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good question. It is true 2@S is not a reverse. And if East did not hold 3 diamonds (which is the worst holding you can have in an opps suit) I think 2@S would be my choice. I might bid it anway, but the singleton heart and 3@D both are negatives so pass is probably best.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@S is not a reverse |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=reverses^*N|CP||AT|. It does show some extras. |
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A reverse is defined as "voluntarily" bypassing your first suit at the 2-level to make a higher bid. In this case, 2@C is not available as a bid to east, so 2@S is not "voluntarily" bypassing 2@C. However, 2@S not exactly being a reverse, it should show at least a good distributional opener with 5+ clubs and 4 spades.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As another example, if the auction (on a different hand) started 1@D-P-1@H-2@C-? then 2@S over 2@C would be a reverse, because 2@D was available as a bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the auction as it was, your bidding was correct Barbara. I was just saying if North opened 2@S how the auction might proceed. On this hand opening 2@S probably still lets E/W get to 3N (or 5C which is also a reasonable IMP contract). But it does make it harder and aggressive preempting does sometimes make the opponents guess wrong as to what they should bid.|

(although looking at both hands, it turns out slam is pretty reasonable.) because we could have 33 if North has a max but more likely we have less than 33. So I just bid 4@H.|mb|4H|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Unfortunately, although 4H is a nice contract there is no good way to get there. This is another rare hand where SAYC might work out better than 2/1. I do not have a game forcing hand, but playing SAYC I might decide to bid 2@H over 1@S (although with 5 bad hearts and 5 nice clubs one could make a good argument that 2@C is better than 2@H).|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if I bid 2@H we get to 4@H since North raises to 3@H and I have a clear 4@H bid. Having said all that, I still strongly recommend 2/1 rather than SAYC. It is a much much better bidding system.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Play:
Give yourself two chances rather than one. 

Win the opening lead and play the @CA K. If the @CQ drops, you are playing for the overtrick. |
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


NT|^b@2
If the queen doesn't drop, lead a diamond to the @DQ and a diamond to the @D10. If the finesse works, dump one of dummy's hearts on a high spade and the other two on diamonds. |
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Your wish list must include that the player with the outstanding @CQ also has at least three diamonds (so you can dispose of the heart losers in dummy), and that East has the @DJ. |
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Although finessing the @D10 loses to West holding @DJ x x, finessing gains when West has @Dx x x (giving East @DJ x x x) and there are five more holdings of @Dx x x than @DJ x x with West. So the finesse is the perecentage play.|

NT|^b@2 
Opening 1NT has a lot going for it. You show your balanced shape immediately, you tell partner that you have 15-17 points, and the 1NT bid itself is a little pre-emptive in that it is difficult to overcall. Hopefully partner will be able to provide you with a Heart stopper anyway.|mb|1n|

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Play.
Some say that 1NT is the most difficult contract to play because every suit counts and needs to be carefully handled. |
PG| ***** 197 ***** |


NT|^b@2
West leads the @S10 and before we rush to play this miserable little part-score, we must first count our top tricks. We have four top Spades and the @CA for a total of five top tricks. |
PG| ***** 198 ***** |


AT| Now, it is usually correct to play the honors from the short side first but on this hand, in Spades,  we have an exception to that rule. |
PG| ***** 199 ***** |


NT|^b@2
To make "extras" we can easily force out the @HA, setting up three slow Heart tricks. However, what if the opponents do not take the @HA on the first round of Hearts? How might we gain access to the table? The only sure way across to dummy is via the @SJ so we mustn't squander that card at trick one.|
PG| ***** 200 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Instead, we must win the opening lead in the closed hand and play the @H10. If the opponents refuse to take the Ace we play another Heart and can keep playing the suit until the @HA goes. The opponents do take the Ace on the second round of Hearts (note how this disconnects the North-South hands in Hearts. Good defense!) and innocently return a Spade. Now we use the @SJ as access to dummy to enjoy two more Heart winners.|
PG| ***** 201 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Note: Because we have the @CA in hand we can afford to block the Spade suit as we later return with that Ace to cash the remaining Spade tricks.|
PG| ***** 202 ***** |


AT| Who'd have thought it? A deceptively simple 1NT contract turned out to be a bit of a mind-boggler. |
