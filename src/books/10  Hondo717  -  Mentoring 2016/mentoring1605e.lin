PG| ***** 2 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On the other hand, she has 7 tricks and it is likely I will get a trick in whatever suit is the opening lead. So I just need to take one more trick, but lets see how we do.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out 3NT also makes as we have 7 hearts and 1 spade off the top and can easily develop another trick in either minor.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT|^B@2
3NT is sometimes easier to make than 4@H or 4@S, particularly when dummy is unlikely to score a ruff which was the case on this hand.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT|^B@2
One other small comment. Nanda should duck the @DA. It is not likely to matter because it appears that Barbara has the @DQ and it could be a singleton.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But if that were the case, then Barbara would not have played a spade first before playing a diamond. She would have played her singleton diamond queen to set up a discard on the diamond king, So, as usual, 2nd hand low was correct.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I probably pass 1@S also. 2@D is possible with Margaret's quality suit, especially non-vul. But the @SQ is suspect on offense and she has a flat hand. So I think pass is better than 2@D.|mb|2D|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another good bid by Barbara. although she only has 13 HCP, her diamond void is a really nice feature of her hand. I like 3@H better than 2@H. I would rate her bid as 2.75H, meaning she should bid 3@H although it is a slight stretch.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played. The trump return was a good play. So Margaret probably should have led another trump when in with the @CK.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Hand probably still makes by setting up spades, but it is harder to play. More importantly, on both hands Barbara did a very good job of evaluating her hand as being worth much more than her HCP indicated.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Remember, HCP are only one component of how good your hand is. Distribution is often almost as important. Long suits and shortness both contribute to making your hand more valuable.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is why Bergen hand evaluation is such a good tool. It takes distribution and the location of your high cards into account. Those who simply count HCP cannot bid accurately.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Play:
Ruffing clubs was a good play. And once the heart finesse works, 4 is assured. The other alternative is to set up the West hand by drawing trump and playing hearts. If trump are 3-2, then at worst Margaret loses 1 heart, 1 spade, and 1 diamond.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If she guesses the hearts she can make 5. So that would be another way to play the hand. In fact, had she held the West hand as declarer and East was dummy, I suspect she would have played it that way.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Psychologically people find it easier to set up their hand than dummy. However, as declarer sometimes (although granted not often) you should set up dummy. so you need to think about that when planning the hand.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT|^B@2
mcannon:  if I play it that way, how do I get rid of the club losers?|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You don't have to get rid of the club losers. West only has 2 clubs. Set up the West hand. You simply need to ruff a diamond in the East hand, and possibly lose a heart.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is a little tricky to bid 4N with a void.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is a case where playing 5N asks for specific kings works well. Let me explain. Many experts play 5N does not ask for number of kings but specific kings.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Barbara asks a good question. Actually, the way I play is that I play 1NT by partner over 1@C (which is a bid I prefer not making if at all possible) shows 8-10. So what do I do with a hand such as Margaret's where she must respond but has no suit?|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Just a quick comment on the bidding. East's overcall only promised 10+ pts, but West, with that super trump support and stunningly gorgeous side suit, would have to be yellow as a buttercup to not go to game. |
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Take a look at this from the declarer's point of view. He's got five Spade tricks, six Heart tricks and, with distribution, 27-28 ish points. All he needs is to get on lead and away he goes. |
PG| ***** 171 ***** |


NT|^b@2
We make our very routine @DA lead, which tells Pard a lot. It tells him a) we've got the @DK and is very suggestive of a tenace Club holding that required partner to lead the suit. We bid it, why not lead it unless we've got that tenace?|
PG| ***** 172 ***** |


NT|^b@2
You've heard me say dozens of times that the third card played in a hand of bridge is usually the most important and informative card. So it is here. Pard selects his @D9. This shows one of two holdings. Either he's got a doubleton or he holds an honor equal to our @DA. |
PG| ***** 173 ***** |


NT|^b@2
If he had a doubleton, then East would have to hold six Diamonds. Look at his hand. Picture it with six Diamonds to go with his six Hearts. Do you think the bidding would have gone the same way? Me neither. |
PG| ***** 174 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Knowing (with a little thinking) that Pard holds the @DQ, it's a simple matter to throw the lead over the net to him. He'll know that it's his job to lead a Club now. If he doesn't, you won't be blamed for trading him in at the Partner Exchange round. |
PG| ***** 175 ***** |


NT|^b@2
So, by reading the third card played, the defense takes the first four tricks, and sadly (yeah, right!) the declarer goes down. |

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|West led the @CQ against 6@S and the original declarer saw that he could avoid a Diamond loser by taking a ruff in the dummy. He won the Club lead and played the Ace and King of diamonds. He then led the @D9, ruffing with dummy's @SQ. Just as well, because if had ruffed with the @S7, East would have overruffed. |
PG| ***** 204 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Did you spot an even better way to play the contract? You could draw one round of trumps with the @SA before taking your Diamond ruff. This would cater for the minuscule chance of a defender holding one Diamond and one trump. He would not then be able to ruff the second round of Diamonds. |
PG| ***** 205 ***** |


NT|^b@2
(I did not set this as the required line of play for you to follow because the main lesson of the deal was that you should ruff the third round of Diamonds high, with the @SQ, rather than with the @S7). |

^B@2^o@3^*BPhillp Adler: ^*N|cp||at|This series of articles will concentrate on basic declarer play and defense. We will start with the easiest notrump play. When the dummy is tabled, pause and plan your campaign. If you Watched me play, you would notice that I rarely call for dummy's card in under 30 seconds, and I am pretty quick at analyzing a deal—I've had lots of practice. So if I take 30 seconds, how long should you pause? Two minutes? Five minutes?

What do you do in that time? You start by counting your top tricks, winners that you could cash now. Next are some examples:|
