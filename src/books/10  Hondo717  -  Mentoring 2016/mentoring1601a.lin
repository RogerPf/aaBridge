^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One of the advantages of Bergen Raises is any time you have 5 card support you want to be in 4. However, if you have a limit raise, it is quite possible you should be in slam. Playing normal limit raises you can't bid 3@H because partner might pass. |
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But playing Bergen Raises with 5-card support you can bid 3@D or 3@C (regular or reverse respectively) and then raise 3 to 4. That way you don't miss 4 yet still get to show limit raise values in case you have slam. With all that in mind, this hand is not quite a limit raise and I am just going to bid 4@H.|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding: The bidding was ok. However, Moe might consider bidding with his hand. 2@H (Michaels) is possible although his spades are pretty weak (even for Howard's taste). Another possibility is 3@D preemptive. It turns out regardless of what he bids I am bidding 4@H so on this hand it doesn't matter.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Play: Jo An did not manage her entries as well as she might have. At worst case she has 2 diamond and 2 club losers. If the @DA or @CQ are onside she can make 4. So she needs to make sure she has enough entries to lead clubs twice and diamonds once from dummy towards her hand.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Entry management is difficult but necessary on many hands. which is why you need to plan the play at trick one. An expert would win the @SA, cashes 2 hearts, the @SK and @SQ throwing a minor suit card (probably a diamond). He then leads the @H10 to the @HJ (to preserve entries to dummy).|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| After getting to dummy then lead a low club and insert the @C10. Moe wins the @cQ. Now has to lead a club in order to beat the hand. if he leads either a diamond or a spade 4@H makes.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Assuming he leads a club then Jo An still has another heart entry to try for the @DA onside. So remember to plan out the hand at trick one. On this hand proper defense beats it.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In the old days (when I started playing bridge), with 5 clubs and 5 spades, the proper bid was considered 1@C. The reason being that I could then bid spades twice to describe my hand and keep the bidding at the 2-level. However, these days, there is emphasis on getting your majors in early because of all the preempting that goes on. Now 1@S is considered the correct opening bid on 5-5 black hands. If some teachers tell you it is 1@C, then you know they are old timers -:). |mb|1S|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this sort of auction North should strain to double or balance. Whenever it goes 1x-p-2x, you should try and compete. Letting the opponents play at the 2-level when they have a known fit is losing bridge in the long run. Anna made an expert bid. 2N cannot possibly be natural since she didn't bid 1N. |
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore 2NT is a takeout double for the minors. It is not the "Unusual 2NT" promising 5/5 in the minors because with that hand Anna would normally have bid 2N directly over 1H. It guarantees at least 4 cards in each minor and is often 5-4 in the minors. So it is a "cousin" to the Unusual 2NT but not exactly the same thing|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As is often the case aggressive bidding worked out. We actually should make 4 since Moe should not duck the @DA. In 3@D they lose 2 spades, 1 club, 1 diamond and 1 heart for down 1. Some might ask, according to the law of total tricks Jo An should bid 4@D.|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although that is technically true there are several reasons why I think a pass by Jo An is best.|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The hand is 4-3-3-3 and when you have a close LOTT decision that should dissuade you from pushing. They are vul, and down 2 (especially if doubled) will probably not be a good result. And, this is an important tactical reason that many people don't take into account.|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If Jo An bids 4@D how will she feel if we bid 4S? Probably not too good. Therefore, whenever competing to 4 of a minor over their major, before bidding 4 consider whether you will be happy or sad if they bid 4 of their major.|
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case 4@D will not work out well if we either double or bid 4@S. SO when you bid 4@D you must consider the risk vs the reward. in this hand, you can see the risk probably outweighs the reward, but this is one of the very few cases where that is true. Most often being more aggressive is best.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Moe could make a negative double although he is a bit weak.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I am pretty sure he has at most 2 hearts. I like my distribution and stiff club. And I can play opposite 2 small hearts. On the other hand, I don't like being vul, but since Moe showed some values, I am going to bid 3@H (although double dummy 3@S is a much better contract).|mb|3H|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@H is another aggressive bid, pass at this vul would not be terrible. I have to hope to get lucky in hearts and that spades are 3-2.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2nd hand low is usually right. However, the one BIG exception is "^*BYou can play 2nd hand high if you can set the hand.^*N" Definitely train yourself to play 2nd hand low quickly and smoothly, but remember the one exception.|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, even if you forget the 1 exception, if you always play 2nd hand low, you will come out way ahead.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So we should have been in 3@S. And you can make a case with such nice spades perhaps I should bid it 3@S after the double especially because I know Moe has no more than 2 hearts. 3@S probably makes, although I do have to worry about Moe's clubs.|

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Did you play the wrong card? Although it will probably not work at all, but you should play either the @c10 or the @cJ on the first trick to at least attempt to mask the situation in the club suit.|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


NT|^B@2
There's no point playing the @cK because your RHO will know that his partner would have led the @cJ from @cJ 10 6 2 (if your @cK was believed to be a singleton). And similarly with playing the @c6 too (your RHO will know his partner would probably have led the @cJ from @cK J 10 2).|

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding: Although South is in the range of 15-17, the hand is too unbalanced for a 1NT opening.|

NT|^B@2
There's no point playing the @CK because your RHO will know that his partner would have led the @CJ from @CJ 10 6 2 (if your @CK was believed to be a singleton). Similarly with playing the @C6 too (your RHO will know their partner would probably have led the @CJ from @CK J 10 2). |
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


NT|^B@2
After getting a club ruff, your LHO tries his best by under leading the @DA hoping for you to misguess if you had the @DJ in order to get another club ruff. But you have the @DQ today, so no luck there. |
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The problem for you now is to pick up the trump suit, since if you misguess the opponents will then cash out their @DA immediately (the defense knows if the @HK is onside for you or not). So how should you play the trump suit?|
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It looks like a normal suit combination where we have to lead the @SK and then take a finesse with the @SJ. But actually, this isn't the right play given what has happened so far. What do you think this means? |
PG| ***** 162 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Well your LHO has led a singleton club and got a ruff. Do you think your opponent would have led a singleton club looking at @SQ x x or @SQ 10 x x ?|
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


NT|^B@2
No, that would be highly unlikely as the natural play would be to hope to get a natural trump trick. So the better way to play the trump suit is to lead a small spade to dummy's ace.|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If your LHO started off life with @S10 x, after getting a ruff he would now be left with a singleton @S10. By playing a spade to dummy's ace you will then see your LHO follow with the @S10.|
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In this case, you can now finesse the @SQ through your RHO.  As it is on this deal, your RHO has @SQ x doubleton so you will pick up the spade suit.|
