^b@2So you have written a small lin file in your text editor and want to test it @-

^c@.   ^*bDrag and Drop^*n that file on to ^*baaBridge^*n. It will then appear in the chapter headings column on your left.

Your file will now appear in that column exactly as does the title to this file, black text in a white box.  Note the
|cp|7|at|^*bNavigation Bar^*n|cp||at|.  The cream and grey line, with bobbles on it, at the bottom of this window. Clicking on that bar will move you to that point in your lin file.

The  'edit and test cycle'  is now as follows -

^c@2@.   You are in your editor happily editing away until you decide you want to test your changes.

^c@2@.   Save the file in your editor  @-  |cp|5|at|^*i It's easy to forget to do this :) ^*n|cp||at|

^c@2@.   Look at the |cp|7|at|^*b Navigation Bar^*n|cp||at| and notice exactly where the cream line turns to gray.

^c@2@.   ^*bClick on^*n the name of your file in the gray chapter column. This will reload your edited file into ^*b aaBridge^*n.

^c@2@.   ^*bClick on^*n the place in the |cp|7|at|^*b Navigation Bar^*n|cp||at| where you noticed that the cream line turned to gray.

^b@2And you are back exactly where you were but with your new version in aaBridge and you can ^*b Step ^*n or ^*b Flow ^*n happily.

This is called a   'two click'   edit and test cycle  @-  enjoy.


|cp|5|at|^*i P.S. You can drag and drop multiple lin files or a whole folder.^*n|cp||at|
