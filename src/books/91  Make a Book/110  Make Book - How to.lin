^b@2The topics covered are all visible in the chapter headings column (click-able), the tall grey area on your left.

@.   Collect your material


@.   Write the lin file.  Each lin file is called a chapter. Having only one chapter is fine


@.   Test the lin file as you write it


@.   Possibly build up a number of lin files (chapters) in a folder to form a "book"


@.   Book into Jar @- get an existing  ^*baaBridge.|cp|7|at|^*bjar^*n|cp||at|^*n  file 
	^fo   delete any unwanted books that are inside it
	^fo   add in your own folder (book)

	
@.   Lastly - a few final, but important, points.
