at|^^|fp||at|^b@2Your lin file (or files) are written and tested and in a folder that ^*bmust^*n start with, two digits and a space. If you are making a "Single Book" edition, it must be "01 " for a multi-book edition it has to be between "01 " and "89 ".  

Starting from the most up to date  ^*baaBridge_^*n<version>^*b.jar^*n  that you have (this one should be fine).  Make a copy and rename it to   ^*baaBridge_^*nnewTitleGoesHere_^*n<version>^*b.|cp|7|at|^*bzip^*n|cp||at|.    We will rename it back to .|cp|7|at|^*bjar^*n|cp||at| later.

Use the standard method of your operating system to unzip this file to a folder.

You can now make changes to the newly created folder. These are -

^c@.   Delete any unwanted books that inside the books folder.   |cp|7|at|^*bPlease leave^*n|cp||at|  the Help and How To's,   90 ... 99

^c@.   Copy your finished book, in its folder, into the ^*b books ^*n folder

^c@.   Re-zip the expanded folder containing your changes to produce a ^*bzip^*n file.

^c@.   Rename the ^*b zip ^*n file back to .|cp|7|at|^*bjar^*n|cp||at|

^bRun the jar in the normal way for your system to test it.  ^*bDbl-Click^*n works on most systems.

Take cake when re-zipping not to introduce an extra level in to the hierarchy.  In windows you can click on a .zip file to enter it and so compare the internal structure of the before and after versions.

|cp|7|at|^*bNote that - the unzipped folder gives you access to all the embedded books @- a great source for examples.^*n|cp||at|

|cp|5|at|^*iWindows users can instead use the  FREE ^*b7-Zip^*n utility to directly edit the .jar file (much faster) click ^*h http://www.7-zip.org/ ^*nhere^*x |cp||at|
