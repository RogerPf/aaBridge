As your lin file grows there comes a time when you want to do a more detailed check that all is as you wish.
In windows Open a 'Command Box' aka (DOS box)  on the MAC  Open a 'Terminal'. 
|n#|5|at|In that window use  (type in)  the  |fp|p|at|cd|fp||at|  command to get you to the folder where you have ^*b aaBrigdge ^*n
on Windows this is normally   |fp|m|at|cd C:\ProgramSmall\aaBridge|fp|m|fp||at|   MAC users will know where they put it.
|n#|5|at|^c(I promise you doing this stuff is  EASY  but learning it the first time is strange  -  google  for  help)
|n#|5|at|In that new open window you can use the  |fp|p|at|dir|fp||at|  command (Windows) or  |fp|p|at|ls|fp||at|  command  (Mac) and see the current name of your newest ^*b aaBridge ^*n .jar  file  eg:   |fp|m|at|aaBridge_3.1.0.2814.jar|fp||at|
|n#|9|at|^c now type        |fp|m|at|java -jar aaBridge_<your-ver>.jar  |fp||at| (+ press 'Enter')  and  aaBridge  will start.
|n#|9|at|^c (both systems have  'file name competion'  so all you need to do is type  |fp|p|at|aa|fp||at|  and then hit the  TAB  key.)
|n#|9|at|In the newly opened ^*b aaBridge ^*n window you can, as normal,  ^*b Drag and Drop ^*n ANY  lin file including your own.
|cp|red|at|^*b Look in the terminal window ^*n |cp||at| in which you started ^*b aaBridge ^*n above.  Any problems will be reported there.
|n#|5|at|You can prove it works but using the menubar       ^*b|cp|red|at|Books|cp||at|^*n     >     ^*bHondo717  -  Mentoring 2013  ^*n
that will open the lin file     ^*bmentoring1301a^*n     and produce the message line (in the window)
|fp|s|n#|5|at|^cLine 859  pg 199   pdl__pc - Card played not in hand!: Diamonds Three  will try to play lowest|fp||at|
|n#|5|at|You see even Kia  (the greatest lin file writer of them all)  is not perferct.
