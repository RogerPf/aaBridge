^b@2^*bQ.^*n   How do I get aaBridge to start in MultiBook mode, for a ^*b new user^*n ?

^*bA.^*n   Inside@2 the book  '90  Welcome Help...'  is a file with a name containing the text  DEFAULT_TO_SINGLE_BOOK  change that name (only slightly so switching back is easy) for example to  xEFAULT_TO_SINGLE_BOOK.



^b@2^*bQ.^*n   How do I get a  'nice title'  for my book showing in the Menu ?

^*bA.^*n   Look at the example title definition file in   @-  "91  Make a Book".



^b@2^*b@2Q.^*n   How do I get aaBridge to run in  devMode ?

^*bA.^*n   Create a file called    _aaBridge_dev.txt    at the root of your file system or in /a/  ,  C:\a\
^j devMode is nothing special just a few extra menu options.



^b@2^*b@2Q.^*n   Where can I find the   |cp|7|at|^*b.java  source^*n|cp||at|   files for ^*b aaBridge ^*n?

^*bA.^*n   The should be together with the  .class  files in the aaBridge .jar.   They should also (eventually) be put on github.
