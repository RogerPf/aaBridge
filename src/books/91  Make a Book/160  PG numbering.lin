PG's (page's) are the core command of lin file structure.  ^*baaBridge^*n shows you the page number you are currently on by displaying the current 'page number' in the bottom right.  |cp|7|at|^*bPlease Click Flow > ^*n|cp||

The number  ^*b3^*n  is now showing in the bottom right corner.  Within aaBridge is a package that comes as a .zip file that can go through any .lin file and add in page numbers that will match the page numbers that aaBridge displays.  This makes finding the place in your lin file where you want to makes changes - VERY EASY.

It will also check that your commands (like !PG!) are aligned correctly with only two bar characters between them.

This  ^*bpg_package.zip^*n  also contains a  .pdf  file that gives much more documentation than can be put here.



To get the package, click the 'button' bellow -


  |fp|8|cs|3|at||fp||at| { ^*f copyFile_aaPgPackage, Copy   the aaPG_Package   to your Desktop ^*n }  |fp|9|cs||fp||at|

The file          ^*b000  aapg package.zip^*n         will now be on your Desktop.
