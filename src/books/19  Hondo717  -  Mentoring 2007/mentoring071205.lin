^d @e@2"nome" believes, “You need repetitions when you start bridge late.” So he trails good @E@3 teachers in the BBO. When possible he attends their lectures, mentoring sessions and tournaments. He squirrels away every note and movie of the hands though he cannot find them when he needs them. As a remedy he decided to incorporate some of those hordes in several presentations such as the one you are about to view. 

In this presentation "nome" combined the movie of the hands from hondo717's December 2, 4 & 5 mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log transcript.  

The goal here is presenting to you hondo717's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. Clicking the first will move you forward and clicking the second will take you back. When available there is an explanation for the bid in the gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. 

Further, all the links in this presentation are clickable - it changes color when you roll your cursor over it.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site. @D@DPlease note that this is a recreation of the mentoring sessions where for teaching purpose unlike the live play you can view all four hands.@D@D




                           Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

Pear: When I have a 4,3,3,3 hand and JUST fits rule of 20 do I still deduct 1 pt and pass?
hondo717: To fit the rule of 20, that hand must have  13 HCP, so you can open. but with 12 HCP balanced you do not open.
Pear: ok ... I had one today and passed.

hondo717: Well, not terrible to pass, but I think you should open any 13 HCP hand. 
Badmonster: But some balanced twelve pointers look like openers, and some just don’t.|

hondo717: kia you had the rest of the tricks. Just ruff the diamond, and the board was good. Lucky spade situation is why kia could make game, so I think pass by kia was fine.|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


AT| 
hondo717: However, the singleton diamond is a very good feature of kia's hand, so bidding 4 would not be out of the question. The reason I only bid 3 is my void in clubs, given kia opened clubs, was bad. And my K of diamonds, although probably worth a trick, did not fit well with kia's hand particularly when East bid diamonds and raised. Hand evaluation is a dynamic process. After deb raised the diamond there were 2 big minuses to my hand. For example with the same number of points, I would be thinking of slam if my diamonds had been clubs. |

hondo717: Let us talk about how to bid over an intervening takeout double. There is some confusion I have noticed. It used to be that any bid besides redouble denied 10 points. However, that is no longer the case. The way most modern experts play it is one level bids are forcing, same as if there was no double. Two level bids just show a long suit, and deny 10 points. So one level bid is unlimited, but may be as few as 6 HCP. And there is also a convention known as Jordan 2NT which shows a limit raise or better in support. Having said all that, I will pass.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT|
IraCT: Howard after your long explanation why didn't you bid 1@S?|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: I am not obligated to bid over the takeout double, even with 6 points. I should not bid unless I have something significant to say. With only 4 spades and 6 points, did not feel it worth my while to bid, particularly since terry is showing spades. And, yes terry, your singleton heart is the reason 3 spades is ok to bid.|

Pear: If Deb draws trumps she makes it.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: yes, but she didn’t. Now, back to bidding.  debs 2@S was good, showing 10+ HCP and spades, not necessarily 5.  I don’t mind kia taking another bid, but I think 3@C is better.  His hearts are pretty bad, and he has good 5 card club suit. And the singleton heart makes terry's 3@S bid ok. deb has good pass of 3@S, because her hearts will not fit well with terry.  terry must be short in hearts, since kia has 6.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT|
nome: Then 3@C is not a reverse.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: No. Let me explain why. A reverse is|cp|8|at| deliberately|cp||at| going past your suit at the 2 level. If deb had bid 2@D, then 3@C would be a reverse, because 2@H was available and you bypassed it. However, because deb bid 2@S, 2@H was no longer available, so 3@C is not a reverse. On the other hand, 3@C is cheaper than 3@H, and it is not a reverse.|

hondo717: Now, I have to decide whether or not to balance. Balance meaning bid as opposed to passing. On the plus side I am short of spades. On the minus side I have few points. However, given the auction, it is virtually certain that kia has a pretty good hand.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT|
tryiton: What is the value to balancing?|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: The value of balancing is I do not want to let them play at the one level if we can make something and with this hand we probably can. The danger is we will get too high, or they may bid game if deb has a really good hand.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


mb|d|mb|2H|NT|
tryiton: Is it wise to have a feature when deciding to balance?|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: If I bid a suit, it is 5+ cards long.  It is wise to either have some points, or shortness in the opponent’s suit. In this case, I think a case could be made either way. I will reopen with a double, just to make it interesting.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


AT| 
Badmonster: It's as if you aren't advocating bidding because it's your turn. I disagree with that position. |cp|8|at|
hondo717: just discussing the theory of balancing.|

bizmiz: This must be a take out double.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |

hondo717: yes, my double was takeout, but kia could pass with a spade stack had deb passed.|

NT|
hondo717: well, kia, you have spades, that is bad. And you don’t have a whole lot more points than I have a right to expect.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


mb|p|mb|2S|NT|
hondo717: terry, 2@S is a better bid because deb may only have 4 hearts, and she definitely has 5 spades. That would be a preferential bid.  If you had 3 hearts you would pass 2@H bid.|

nome: I have decided to lead a @D7.  |
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


AT| 
hondo717: 4th best is the correct bid. If you lead the 10 instead I will think you do not have an honor.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


AT| bizmiz: why D instead of from clubs doubleton?|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Generally speaking leading doubletons is not a good idea if you have another good suit with honor to lead. Further, it is possible, particularly on this auction, that because kia is short, terry is long, and deb may get some diamond discards on clubs.|

^d@e@2Whether aristocrat, lawyer, farmer, or shopkeeper fifty–six ordinary men achieved something extra- @E@3ordinary when the Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776. The British called the document treasonous and the signatories traitors – singing it was an act punishable by death. Some signers lost their home in the ensuing Revolutionary War. Others were left without their livelihood. All had put their lives on the line.

The Declaration wasn’t just a blueprint for revolution; it helped to secure the future of the United States and became the mission statement for world democracy. We’re all familiar with the famous signers of the Declaration. Here, as a weekly series we will tell you about some of the lesser-known, ordinary heroes who declared our nation’s future. This week we have two more. |cp|8|FP|2|at|

hondo717: A few minor technique points, although I am happy with the way everybody played in general. First of all, to reiterate, when it goes 1@C/1@D-1@H, if you bid spades you promise 5. With 4 spades you make a negative double
hondo717: so my 1@S promised at least 5 spades. Once roberta bids 2@C, I sensed a misfit. If you sense a misfit, you should pass ASAP. As you can see, if I got ambitious, we would probably go down. Granted we had a diamond fit, but because of the spade void, we are actually better off in clubs.|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


NT|
hondo717: Now for the opening lead. A club is probably not good, because it is likely west has clubs and south is short. You would be finessing partner most likely. fortunately, since I had stiff Ace, that didn’t happen, but it could easily have. I think here the best lead was the Ace of hearts. And west should show count, by playing the 6 first. And when west gets in and leads a heart, roberta should play the 10, that works if west has the J.|
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


NT|
hondo717: With 3 small opposite Q10x, the most likely way for you to get a trick is to play the 10. But as I said, those are minor points. good job in general roberta.|

camilleln: When I was leading back for my partner to ruff, I should have led back a high card to show return of a spade, but didn't want to part with a high heart. what should I have done?|

PG| ***** 113 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: You could, but you are border line. You have 16 HCP, but your diamonds are ok, but not terrific. normally you would want a somewhat better suit. So 2@D is ok, but conservative. 3@D is aggressive. You wish you could bid 2.5 diamonds, lol. With a better hand though you can bid 3D with 16 points.|

PG| ***** 116 ***** |

hondo717: Not marked with the ace, but granted more likely to have the ace. It turns out 3NT is not a bad contract, but tough to get there. even if roberta bid 3@D, which I would have passed. On the other hand she is too weak to jump to 2NT over 1@S and a little strong to bid 1NT. To recap a 2@D bid is limited to 15 or a mediocre 16 and you ned 6@D and 17 or more for 3@D bid.|

hondo717: This is a good hand to learn the Ogust convention. So we will explain it after ally bid 2NT. If you play Ogust over weak 2@s, your responses are as follows:
          First, you decide whether you have a good hand or a bad hand. A good hand means 
          8-10 HCP, a bad hand 7-9.
          Next, you decide whether or not you have a good suit. A good suit is
          having 2 of the top 3 honors, e.g. AK, AQ or KQ.|
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


NT|
hondo717: Then, your responses which are completely artificial are:|cp|8|at|
        3@C shows a bad hand and a bad suit;
        3@D shows a bad hand and a good suit;
        3@H shows a good hand and a bad suit;
        3@S shows a good hand and a good suit;
        3NT shows all 3 top honors (AKQxxx).|
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


CP||NT|
hondo717: The minor suit responses show a bad hand, and the major suit responses show a good hand. In this case I have a good hand, 10 HCP, but a bad suit so I bid 3@H. Then, ally knows we have enough points to make game. The question would be whether bid 3NT or 4@S. I would recommend 4 spades, since I have a bad suit, it is unlikely we can run spades before they set up a side suit. A bad suit is defined as not having 2 of the top 3 honors in terms of Ogust.|

camilleln: Ron Klinger has  great way to remember Ogust..Majors-Maximum, Minors Minimum....short...MaMa MiMi, 12 123. Clubs is 1 honor, diamond 2 honors, heart is 1 honor, spade is 2 honors, and NT is 3 honors.|

hondo717: Nice lead judy. 4 spades is a reasonable contract. It makes if judy has A of clubs, or clubs are not led.

Now, Now to  my philosophy on weak 2s. I think you should open a weak 2 pretty much any time you have a six card suit, and 5-10 HCP. Even if you have a bad six card suit 10xxxxx. I think the plusses you gain over opening a weak 2 far outweigh the minuses.|
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


NT|
hondo717: You have taken a lot of bidding room away from the opponents. I might not open with a real bad suit if vulnerable, but I certainly would open my hand a weak 2 vulnerable, even without one of the honors. I also don’t worry about whether I have a 4 card major or not. True, you might occasionally miss a 4-4 fit, but unless you play in game in the major, it usually makes no difference.|
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


NT|
hondo717: You are using the weak 2 to preempt the opponents, assuming  that you are making it hard for them. I understand that  my philosophy is not main stream thinking, but I just present it for your consideration. Other teachers will disagree with me, and that is certainly a reasonable position. However, I have had great success playing my style of weak 2@s, particularly if you use Ogust in conjunction with it. I think my philosophy would not work quite as well without Ogust, but I would still play it even without Ogust.|

hondo717: Now, because I have long hearts, a trump lead should be considered. However, because with the Q I might easily give up a trick. Further, here is what ally needs to be worried about hearts setting up by declarer for pitching diamonds losers. So we want to take our diamond winners if possible. |

hondo717: Let us discuss when to defend passively vs. when to defend aggressively. Passive defense is when you defend to not give anything away, and is what most people are comfortable with and it is probably right to be passive more often than not. However, there are times when you must take risks in defense. This is particularly true if you think declarer is planning setting up a long suit for discards. In that case, you must try to take your tricks immediately, so leading away from an honor could very well be right.|

hondo717: well, 3 level bids are defined as showing a long semi-solid suit, whether playing Capp or don’t. If Vul, you better have a good 7 card suit at least. Playing DONT, and assuming I chose not to bid 3@C, I would double and pass judy's forced 2@C response. The double in DONT shows a single suited hand.|
