^d @e@2In this presentation "nome" combined the movie of the hands from Howard's   @E@3recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log transcript.  

The goal here is presenting to you Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. Clicking the first will move you forward and clicking the second will take you back. When available there is an explanation for the bid in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. 

All the links in this presentation are clickable - it changes color when you roll your cursor over it. Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site. At the end of most boards, if not all, the viewer would be able to play the hand double dummy or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.

@D@DPlease note that this is a recreation of the mentoring sessions where for teaching purpose unlike the live play you can view all four hands.@D@D|fp||at|

hondo717: Let me suggest a slightly different line of play kia.  You were a bit lucky that terry could not ruff the 3rd spade. After deb leads a heart, draw the last trump in your hand, and play a club. You then get all the tricks except the club. I am not sure why deb ducked the club. My line of play guarantees 3 for sure.|

PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT|
hondo717: Well, you have to come to 10 tricks. If spades are 2-2, one plan is to just lose a diamond, and then you have 10 tricks. However if spades are not 2-2, probably bestif you take ruffing finesse in diamonds for your 10th trick. So play AK of spades and cross your fingers. If that doesnt work, plan b is to set up diamonds.|

hondo717: I think it would have been easier if you just let 10 of diamonds lose. Then you have 3 diamond tricks. But this works as well. Typically, when you are planning the play in a suit contract, you count your losers. However, sometimes you must also count your winners, as on this hand. It looked like you only had 2 club losers, and no spades if they were 2-2. However, you must also figure out a way to take 10 tricks. So you count your winners.|

I suggest you read my 2 tutorials on play of the hand, one on NT and one on suits. They are on my web site, ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge^*N. And to answer questions from kia and terry. 10 tricks is the limit on this hand there is no way to defeat it.|

^-{                   BERGEN RAISES - by - HOWARD                }
^-|
fp||cp||at|
^d @e@2Here is a brief explanation of Bergen Raises.                                     

Bergen Raises are used by responder after partner opens one of a major and responder has 4 cards @E@3in the opener's suit. Reverse Bergen, which I recommend, works as follows. Responder must have exactly 4 card support. With 5-6 points, responder jumps to 3 of the major, with 7 to a bad 9 responder bids 3 diamonds (known as a "constructive raise"), with a good 9 to 11 responder bids 3 clubs (known as a "limit raise"), and with 12 or more responder bids 2N (the usual Jacoby 2N raise played by many partnerships.)

One of the important advantages of Bergen Raises is the preemptive jump raise (with 5-6 points). Modern competitive bidding theory says it is safe to compete to the 3 level with a 9 card fit, and Bergen Raises allow you to do this in a way that preempts the opponents.

If the intervening opponent bids, Bergen Raises no longer apply. I suggest you play the following methods over interference. If the opponent bids a suit, a cue bid shows a limit raise (9-11) with 4 card support. A jump raise shows less than a limit raise (5-8) with 4 card support. Over a takeout double, 2N shows a limit raise or better with 4 card support (this convention is known as Jordan 2N). And a jump raise still shows less than a limit raise (5-8) with 4 card support.

Some people play regular Bergen rather than Reverse Bergen. The idea is basically the same, only the meaning of the 3 club and 3 diamond bids are reverse, 3 clubs showing 7 to a bad 9 and 3 diamonds showing a good 9 to 11. The reason I prefer Reverse Bergen is that you want to explore for game more often over a limit raise than a constructive raise, and Reverse Bergen gives your partnership more room to explore. However, if your partner insists on playing regular Bergen, most of the value of Bergen Raises still applies.

mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|NT|
hondo717: You could not bid 2NT lisa as you were going to. Because I may not have hearts  and you do not have a heart stopper. The reason I am bidding 4SF is to find out if lisa has 3 spades. If not I will bid 3NT.  4sf is a very flexible convention. Basically, it establishes a game force, while keeping the bidding lower. The 4sf bidder's next call will clarify why he bid 4sf. For example if I were making a club or diamond slam try, would now raise clubs or diamonds.|

hondo717: ok, even though lisa made 6, let us talk about how to play the hand. It is important that you plan the hand out. In NT you count your winners after the opening lead. lisa can count 2 hearts 5 diamonds, 2 clubs and one spade. So you have 10 tricks for sure, and the contract is cold. lisa you  should knock out the K of clubs first, then see if you can get an extra heart trick or spade trick. The heart was a good lead Dorothy.|

hondo717: lisa, basically you should have played diamond finesse at trick 2, and hope that pam does not find club switch if it loses. At that point, pam does not have a lot of information about the hand, and may very well play a heart. Once you knock out the K of diamonds you have 9 tricks, unless they take 5 club tricks first. They don’t know about the club situation, and if you play diamonds early they don’t have a chance to find out and the diamond finesse could work. Remember that even if you know what the best defense is, the defenders don't always know. |

The British called the document treasonous and the signatories traitors – singing it was an act punishable by death. Some signers lost their home in the ensuing Revolutionary War. Others were left without their livelihood. All had put their lives on the line.

The Declaration wasn’t just a blueprint for revolution; it helped to secure the future of the United States and became the mission statement for world democracy. We’re all familiar with the famous signers of the Declaration. Here, as a weekly series we will tell you about some of the lesser-known, ordinary heroes who declared our nation’s future. This week we have two more. |cp|8|FP|2|at|

hondo717: No, that is not correct. Over minor suit openings, sayc and 2/1 use the same bidding. 2/1 only applies if you happen to be able to bid at the 2 level over one of a major. But even if I open 1@H, and you have an opening hand with spades, you still should bid 1@S. If I open 1@S and if you bid 2@C for example, that is game forcing.|

hondo717: So because terry bid the other minor (I opened clubs, and terry bid 2@D over 1N), terry asked if I have 4 hearts and/or 3 spades.

nome: 3@S or 4@C or pass?|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |

Hondo717: 4@C has some merit, but is aggressive. It is likely we are going to game anyway, so in this case it does not have the problem of pushing us into game.|

At the end of this board in response to a good question from deb, I will do the math in whether the sacrifice here is worthwhile or not. |

hondo717: well it turns out we make 6@H, so you did come out ahead deb, because I would have bid it. But if clubs were 3-2, we only make 5 hearts, and you go for minus 800. |

^-{                SACRIFICE (WHEN) - by - HOWARD             }
^-|
fp||cp||at|
^d@e@2Let me discuss when it is good to sacrifice, and when not. For the sake of this discussion, assume the @E@3opponents have bid a makable major suit game, and they are going to double your sacrifice.

At equal vulnerability, assuming the opponents make game, down 2 is a good sacrifice, down 3 is not. For example, non-vulnerable, down 2 is minus 300, and game is 420. And if we are both vulnerable, down 2 is minus 500, and they are plus 620. Down 3, not vulnerable, is not terrible, 500 vs. 420. On the other hand, down 3 vulnerable is not good, 800 vs. 620.

If you are not vulnerable and they are vulnerable, it is ok to go down 3, 500 vs. 620.

If you are vul and the opponents are not, it is almost never right to sacrifice. They have to be making the hand, and you can only be down 1 (200 vs. 420).

In summary, the best time to sacrifice is when you are not vulnerable and they are. I would also occasionally consider a sacrifice if both are not vulnerable, particularly if you think there is a chance that you might even make the contract (for example, when both sides have fits in 2 suits). However it is rarely right to sacrifice when you are vulnerable, even if 
the opponents are also vulnerable.

So I guess I would say your bid was a bit aggressive deb. It happened to work because you went for 1100, and we would have bid slam which would be 1430. However, if clubs were not 4-1, we cannot make slam, and you would go for -800 vs. our 650.
