^d @e@2"nome" believes, “You need repetitions when you start bridge late.” So he trails good @E@3 teachers in the BBO. When possible he attends their lectures, mentoring sessions and tournaments. He squirrels away every note and movie of the hands though he cannot find them when he needs them. As a remedy he decided to incorporate some of those hordes in several presentations such as the one you are about to view. 

In this presentation "nome" combined the movie of the hands from hondo717's mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees.  Those are  condensed from the chat log transcript.  

The goal here is presenting to you hondo717's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. Clicking the first will move you forward and clicking the second will take you back. When available there is an explanation for the bid in the gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. 

Further, all the links in this presentation are clickable - it changes color when you roll your cursor over it.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site. @D@D Further, at the end of each board you can play it double dummy. Use your cursor to select cards from each hand. @D@D




                           Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

hondo717: you have 5 spades, so you need to check to see if I have 3 spades. It works as follows. You bid 3 clubs (the other minor that I didn’t bid.) If I have 4 hearts  I will bid hearts. If I have 3 spades I will bid spades. So you can check for a 5-3 spade fit.|

hondo717: ok, before I pass, let me expound a bit further. If I have both 4 hearts and 3 spades, I will bid hearts, and anne must bid 3NT. However, in that case, because anne bid new minor forcing, and does not have hearts, I know she must have 5 spades, so I will correct to 4 spades.|

when partner bids nmf, you prefer your 4 card suit to 3 card support. But, if partner denies the 4 card suit, she must have 5 of the other suit, because otherwise she would not have bid nmf.|

hondo717: ok, let me suggest a different line of play. Once anne gets the opening heart lead, and wins in her hand, she should count her losers. In general, you should always count your winners and losers before playing the hand. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


at|
With a normal spade break, she has 1 spade loser. She has no heart losers, as long as she ruffs a heart in dummy. She has 1 club loser, and 1 diamond loser. So she should feel that she is odds on to make the contract. As it turns out, because of the bad spade break, she has 2 spade losers too.|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|
However, she has another play to eliminate a diamond loser, to offset the bad spade break. If terry has the K of clubs, she can pitch a diamond loser on a club, by leading low towards the Q. At trick 2 she should lead towards the A of hearts, and then lead a low club. Assume terry wins the K, and plays back, say a diamond. She can win in dummy, lead a club to the Q, ruff a heart in dummy, and play the A of clubs, pitching her diamond loser. It turns out sarah ruffs that trick, but she is ruffing with a natural trump trick anyway.|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|
hondo717: so anne ends up losing 2 spades and 1 club, and makes the hand. The main point is, always count your losers. Come up with a plan and figure out extra chances if possible, in case you get some bad breaks. |

hondo717: ok, for those of you who saw my lesson on competitive bidding, I have a clear 2@S bid.  I know we have at least an 8 card fit, so it is safe to go to the 2 level. If I had 4 spades, would compete to the 3 level. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


mb|3C|mb|3s|nt|
hondo717: let us discuss anne's bid. It is not unreasonable, because she has a good hand. However, because she only has 5 spades, and I only have 3, she may want to just pass, since we don’t have a 9 card fit. Generally speaking, on competitive hands, you use the number of trumps between you to determine how high you go. With an 8 card fit, compete to the 2 level, with a 9 card fit compete to the 3 level. |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |

So we undo her bid and she pass.|

Furhter, with an 8 card fit, if they are only at the 2 level, it is a good idea to force them to the 3 level, so you can bid at the 3 level with an 8 card fit if necessary. But, in this case, terry was already at the 3 level, so no need to do that. The other time it is ok to go to the 3 level with an 8 card fit, is if you have a singleton in their suit. I do have a singleton, so I will bid 3 spades. |

hondo717: I have a tough decision here. That is why preempts are effective. My 2 choices are 4 hearts, since I have such a good suit, or 4 diamonds. I will choose 4 hearts since that is game.|

Too bad about the bad break. terry did well not to double, because then we would end up in 5 diamonds. |
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


at| Interesting bidding. let's start with anne's 2 diamond bid. She has a tough problem.  2 diamonds is a bit of an overbid, but 1NT does not describe the hand. So I think 2 diamonds is a reasonable choice. |
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


at|
Now let us talk about sarah's 3 spade bid. Preempts are high risk, high reward bids. I personally would not bid 3@S with sarah's hand at this vulnerability, because her spade suit is so weak. On the other hand, in this case it worked out rather well. |
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


nt|
My general recommendation is, if in doubt, you should preempt. Bold preempts often work out, as in this hand. Even if it turns out you are down a lot, it is hard with modern bidding for you to be doubled. So, when in doubt, preempt, as sarah did. You will occasionally go for a big number, but most of the time it will work out well. |
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


nT|
That is one reason, contrary to most experts, I advocate opening weak 2s even with an outside 4 card major. Here, I would preempt non-vul with sarah's hand, but not vul. |

^d @H@2hondo717: I like to mention couple of points regarding the auction. I have a pretty clear 4@S bid.  It is barely possible with the right hand in north we can make 6@S, but bidding 4@S has a lot to say for it. It preempts the opponents from finding their likely heart and/or club fit. One could make a case that Paul should bid 4N as takeout for the minors. It turns out they would be down 2 in 5@C, so that is slightly better, but not significantly so in imps. |
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


nt|
^d @H@2pfatseas: Did not know that the minor takeout could be used with anything other than 2NT and I'm 1@d short. |
PG| ***** 88 ***** |

hondo717: Well, that is true, but your stiff spade is very valuable. |
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


AT|
pfatseas: Shouldn't 4@s be defeated? |
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


AT| 
hondo717: Yes, if joyce finds a diamond or club lead, 4@S will go down as it turns out.    Because paul will cash 1 club and 2 diamonds, and lead a third diamond for joyce to ruff.  However, joyce's heart lead was perfectly reasonable. We will discuss the bidding further at the completion of this board. |

nt| 
^d @H@2hondo717: Now back to the auction. When the auction goes 1@S-4@S, 4N is assumed to be minor suit takeout. With a stiff spade, paul should consider it. One basic tenet of competitive bidding is, if they have a fit, you have a fit. Let us assume we have a ten card fit.  That means paul and joyce only have 3 cards in that suit.  Since they have 26 total cards, it means they have 23 cards between them that are not spades.  Therefore, mathematically, they must have at least one 8 card fit.  In real life they usually have a 9 or even 10 card fit. So, if paul bids 4N, joyce should bid her better minor, pretty clear cut here, clubs obviously.  |
PG| ***** 99 ***** |


NT|
^d @H@2Paul can also bid 4N if he has diamonds and hearts. The reason being, joyce assumes it is takeout for the minors and will bid her better minor. If paul has diamonds and hearts, bids 4N, and joyce responds 5@C, then paul can bid 5@D. This says "pard, I meant 4N as a diamond/heart takeout."  So joyce would then pass or bid 5@H with better hearts. |
PG| ***** 100 ***** |


NT|
^d @H@2hondo717: On the other hand, 4@S makes it difficult for the opponents, and you sometimes have to guess. It comes down to judgment, which you only develop over time. But a good rule to follow is if you are short in opponents suit, and think you might want to bid, then do so.  I personally would have bid 4N with paul's hand, although I don’t blame him for passing. With bidding  4N  there are lots of good things that could happen such as, I could be making 5 of a minor, I could push them into 5@S. |
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


NT|
^d @H@2pfatseas: I fully expected to set 4@s with my 3 quick tricks and a contribution from p. |
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


AT| 
hondo717: Well, that is very reasonable paul, but you might also be making game in a minor.  Let me repeat paul  you made a very reasonable choice. It all comes down to judgement and style, and that only comes with experience. |
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


NT|
^d @H@2hondo717: theoretically, you were correct. 4@S can go down, and 5@C does not make.|
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


AT|
However, partners do not always choose the lead that sets them, as is what happened on this hand.  That is what makes bridge so interesting. You need some methods to bid over preemptive bids such as 4@S because it comes up fairly frequently. Therefore, it is good to know this treatment of 4N. |

^d@e@2New Minor Forcing (NMF) is a convention that is used to discover a major suit fit after opener @E@3has rebid 1N or 2N after opening one of a minors and receiving a response of one of a major. Example auctions would be |

If you decide to play NMF, then if responder bids the other minor (clubs if the opening bid was @D, and diamonds if the opening bid was @C), that is the NMF convention. |
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


AT|

Opener is asked to describe his length in the majors. If he has 4 cards in the unbid major, he bids that suit. If he has 3 card support for the major bid by responder, he raises responder.  Note that opener can not have 4 cards in responder's major, because he would have raised immediately rather than bidding NT. |
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


nt|

^d@e@2If he has both, you need to have some agreement. I recommend that opener prefer bidding the 4 card @E@3 major rather than showing 3 card support. As an example, let us use the following auction. |
