^d @e@2"nome" believes, “You need repetitions when you start bridge late.” So he trails good @E@3 teachers in the BBO. When possible he attends their lectures, mentoring sessions and tournaments. He squirrels away every note and movie of the hands though he cannot find them when he needs them. As a remedy he decided to incorporate some of those hordes in several presentations such as the one you are about to view. 

In this presentation "nome" combined the movie of the hands from hondo717's mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees.  Those are  condensed from the chat log transcript.  

The goal here is presenting to you hondo717's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. Clicking the first will move you forward and clicking the second will take you back. When available there is an explanation for the bid in the gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. 

Further, all the links in this presentation are clickable - it changes color when you roll your cursor over it.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site. 




                           Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

hondo717: Ok, terry, you need to balance, probably with a double.  deb may have a good hand and be unable to bid over 1@D. |
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


NT|
hondo717: A balancing double is a little more lax than a direct takeout double. Part of the reason for the double is to protect partner in case they could not bid. For example, they might have a pretty good hand with diamonds. So partner understands when you balance with a double (e.g. double in the pass out seat), you are bidding her cards as well as yours, and may not have a strong hand, or even good ... support for all suits. You can balance with as little as 9 points, if you have the right distribution (e.g. short in opps suit)  and you certainly should balance with 10 or more.|

hondo717: I did bid 5 diamonds with a 4 count. That is something to remember, as the auction progressed, and kia showed a strong hand, my hand got much better. Given I passed originally, I now have a max hand. My Kxxx of diamonds are terrific cards, both the K and the diamond length.|

hondo717: Now, the reason the balance didn't work out is kia probably should have opened 2 clubs. Kia should open 2 clubs if you can count 9 tricks in your hand. kia can count 4-5 diamonds (so make it 4.5), 3-4 hearts (so make it 3.5) and 1.5 spades, totally over 9 tricks. So this would avoid having the hand passed out in 1 diamond as it would have been had I not misdirected terry. The only problem with your opening 2C is it would be played by me, because I would bid 2D, kia would bid 3D, I would raise to 4, and he would bid 6.|

hondo717: Now I will lead my remaining count in diamonds, so kia can be sure I have at least 3 diamonds left. If I have a doubleton, I would lead low, but with 3 or 4 remaining, I lead low. Now, kia should pitch a high diamond, because terry has at most one left, and I might have started with 5. That is an advanced play, but good to remember. Furthe, kia, since I started with 4 at least, and dummy with 2, terry has at most one left, so the Q cannot hurt. That is why leading remaining count is good. you can figure out what partner has. This was how an expert partnership would have defended this hand. Unfortunately, terry was the victim.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT|
analisals: I am confused with your statement  "if I have a double I lead low, but with 3 or more I lead low."|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


AT|

hondo717: When partner leads a suit, you lead back your remaining count. So if I started with 3, I would have 2 left, and would lead the higher one (high/low) to show I had a doubleton left. High/low shows a doubleton. If I have 3 or more left, I lead low, to show I had 3 or more left. |

hondo717: ok, so since I have 2 diamonds and a heart loser, I have to play the club suit for no losers if possible. There are two possibilities. If deb has the singleton K, then I can play a club to the A and finesse terry for the J. Or, a slightly more complicated way is to play terry for a singleton J, and lead the Q of clubs, dropping the J, whether or not deb covers with the K. But I will hope for the simple way.|

hondo717: Now I have a problem here, as is often the case with preempts.  kia might have a good hand with clubs, and had to pass. Or deb might have a good hand, and if I bid, I might go down a lot. I only have 7 HCP, but good distribution if we have a spade or diamond fit. However, since we are vul, I think pass will work out better more often than not. Since if we go down 2, that is worse than their making 3 clubs, even assuming deb cannot double me. But pass could be wrong, which is why I encourage you to preempt.|

hondo717: Now, I am going to play a heart back, that may seem like a silly play. However, I am assuming kia has the A, because usually a preempter does not have an outside A. And since it makes no sense for me to play a heart in general. kia should figure out that I have a singleton, because otherwise it is a very bad play. This is how an expert defender would think.|

In the next panel I have  historical information from an advertisement booklet titled “PORTRIATS OF FREEDOM” inserted in June 12, 2006 The New Yorker. This week and each week thereafter you will be introduced to two patriots. Of course you can click the forward arrow and continue with the bridge not reading the historical information.|

^d@e@2Whether aristocrat, lawyer, farmer, or shopkeeper fifty–six ordinary men achieved something extra- @E@3ordinary when the Declaration of Independence was signed in July 4, 1776. The British called the document treasonous and the signatories traitors – singing it was an act punishable by death. Some signers lost their home in the ensuing Revolutionary War. Others were left without their livelihood. All had put their lives on the line.

The Declaration wasn’t just a blueprint for revolution; it helped to secure the future of the United States and became the mission statement for world democracy. We’re all familiar with the famous signers of the Declaration. This week and the following weeks we will tell you stories of some of the lesser-known, ordinary heroes who declared our nation’s future.|cp|8|FP|2|at|

hondo717: Ok, now let's talk a little about the defense. kia should wonder why deb did not lead another heart. It should occur to him that she was out. However, deb, you can make it easier for kia by leading the 10 of clubs. granted it is misleading, but gets across the point that you dont want clubs back. It comes down to a matter of trusting pard, and if they do something out of place, you have to figure out why they did that.|

NT|
hondo717: ok, deb let us talk about the best way to play the heart suit. You have 9 trumps and missing the K and Q. You have a very good chance of only losing one heart if you play the suit properly. You should play for either a 2-2 break or a singleton honor. So if you play the Ace first, you have to be very unlucky to lose 2 trump tricks. The only time playing the A is wrong is if terry has KQx.|

NT|
hondo717: Let's talk a little about the bidding. First of all, you should agree on whether or not you open 1 of a major or 1N with a balanced 15-17 and a 5 card major.  I recommend opening 1N, because otherwise it is hard to show your points. Hands with 15-17 are often hard to show, because they are too weak for a jump shift, but more than a min. However, assuming you open those hands 1 of a major, then deb's 2NT bid gives kia multiple choices. It says first of all choose between NT and hearts. With kia's hand I would have chosen NT because of the flat distribution. It also says, bid game with 8 or 9, either hearts or 3NT. So, I would have passed with kia's hand, since he has a min, and three Hearts the a bid 3@H is reasonable. It just says he has a min and prefers hearts.|

Badmonster: If you open your balanced 5 of a major hand in NT, what do you open with my hand, which was a bad 18? |
PG| ***** 166 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: If your hearts had been, say clubs, would you have opened 1@C or 1N?|
PG| ***** 167 ***** |

Badmonster: I think 1 Club, but... that's philosophical.|
PG| ***** 168 ***** |

hondo717: OK, then 1@H is ok.|

Badmonster: I like my NT bids to be exactly what's promised. The hard part is the rebid.|
PG| ***** 170 ***** |

hondo717:Actually I think you have a fine 18, don't see why you think it is bad, you have a nice suit, and lots of A and K.|

Badmonster: Because it's just not a good enough 18 count.|
PG| ***** 172 ***** |

PG| ***** 174 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: well KJ is better than Jx, so I think you can give full value to the J. Had kia bid 1N over 1H, I might very well bid 3NT, hoping my hearts take lots of tricks.|

^d@e@2To make my instructions better understood, let me recap the last hand. Once kia bids @E@32@H, he is showing 6-9, with 3 hearts. So, if deb has at least 16, there is some chance that the side has game, if kia is on the top of his range (8 or 9). If deb has 16 or 17, she should try for game. If she has 18 or more, she should just bid game. 

With unbalanced hand, she could bid 3@H with 16 or 17 (asking kia to bid 4@H with 8 or 9) or make a help suit game try. With an unbalanced 18+ point hand, she  should just bid game. With a balanced hand, she could ask kia to choose between NT and hearts, because sometimes NT is easier, as 3NT requires one less trick than 4@H. 

If kia had a balanced hand as well, he therefore might choose NT rather than hearts. So with a game forcing balanced hand (18+) deb could bid 3NT, giving kia a choice between 3NT and 4@H. With an invitational balanced hand (16 or 17), she could bid 2NT, giving him both a choice of strain (NT or hearts), and a choice of level (either a partial or game). In other words, if she bids 2NT, kia's possible responses are pass with a balanced 6 or 7, 3@H with an unbalanced 6 or 7, 3NT with a balanced 8 or 9, or 4@H with an unbalanced 8 or 9.  

I would have passed 2NT with kia's hand, since he also has a balanced hand with less than 8. But if I had deb's hand, I would have bid 3NT, and kia again should pass because his hand is balanced.
