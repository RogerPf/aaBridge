^d @e@2Chat log of Bridge Base Online session for nome starting at: 10:00PM, Mon Sep 10, 2007 @E@3 
  
hondo717: This lesson is by special request, and is instead of my usual weekly mentoring session at the 2/1 Club. I am going to discuss guidelines to competitive bidding. The material presented here is also on my web site. You may download it, as well as many other things. The address is |

PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT|
 
hondo717: I have prepared 16 different examples of competitive auctions. They  can be downloaded from my web site. Before I show you the AUCTIONS, let me discuss a few guidelines that will help you decide how to bid in competitive auctions. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


 

at|

hondo717: first of all, let me define what I mean by a competitive auction.  A competitive auction occurs when each side has approximately the same number of points. Typically each side has somewhere between 17 and 23 HCP.  This scenario happens in a majority of the deals so it is very common. It may surprise you, but the single most important criteria for bidding in competitive auctions is the total number of trumps you have between the two hands.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at| 

hondo717: The simplest way to explain this is that if you can figure out the number of trumps you have, you can safely bid the number of tricks equal to the number of trumps. For example, if you have 8 trumps between the 2 hands, you can safely bid to the 2 level.  Similarly, with 9 trumps, you can safely bid to the 3 level.  With 10 trumps, to the 4 level. BTW, this is why when Pard opens ONE of a major and you have 5 of his suit, you jump to 4 level.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||

fp|2|ht|c|at|^d @e@2hondo717: this principle is based on what is known as the |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


cp|8|at|"Law of Total Tricks"|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


cp||at| @E@3 and if you want a detailed explanation, Larry Cohen has written an excellent book about this law. Marty Bergen (yes the same guy who invented Bergen raises) has a couple of books entitled "Points Schmoints" which are particularly suited to beginners and intermediates. However,  the critical way you apply the law is how I explained it.  The more trump you have, the higher you can bid. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


at|

Pear: are you saying if you KNOW you have 10 trumps you can bypass all the convention and go directly to game? hondo717: Pretty much, unless you are worried about slam.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|

hondo717: Simply said, if Pard opens 1@S and you have 5 spades and less than 10 points, it is almost always right to bid 4@S.  So trump length is the main criteria.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


at|

Pear: so if your partner bid 1@H and you have 7 hearts you can go directly to 6@H's ?|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


at|

hondo717: lol, let's not get carried away Terry.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


at|

hondo717: now there is one other point regarding trump length.  In a competitive hand, it is almost never right to let the opponents play at the 2 level. Basically the rule applies through the 4 level for sure, after that, theoretically it still applies, but you must be more judicious.  And since 11+ card trump fits are pretty rare, I wouldn’t worry too much about it.|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


at|

daddio123: this shows the problem with any "Law".... you can't let it be a substitute for judgment.|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


at|  hondo717: yes david, you still must use judgment, but the law is a very good guideline. When in doubt, I find it works very well on most hands.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt||fp|2|ht|c|at|^d @e@2hondo717: now let us go back to playing at the 2 level. In competitive hands, it is @E@3 almost never right to let the opponents play at the 2 level.  So, if they stop at the 2 level, even if you only have an 8 card fit, you probably should usually go to the 3 level if you have to. However, once they get to the 3 level, you usually let them play it there unless you have a 9 card fit.|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


at|

onoway: vulnerability important here?|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


at|

hondo717: vulnerability is a factor, but only on very close decisions. Do not over worry about vulnerability, especially at IMPs, where you rarely get doubled in partials.|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


at|

hondo717: ok, a couple of other things to consider as well, but less important than the total number of trumps. 
|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


at|
A singleton or void in the opponents trump suit is very valuable. If the opponents are at the 3 level, and you think you only have an 8 card fit, but you have a singleton in their suit, it might be right to bid 3.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


at|

Also where your points are located should be considered.  Points in your suit or suits are very valuable on offense, and should make you bid more. On the other hand, points in their suits are better for defense, and should tend to make you want to bid less.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


at|

Next, I would like to outline the important points. Those are:|

I have this hand with 11 different auctions.  Believe it or not, just to illustrate how the value of your hand changes, depending on the auction. Then I have another hand, with 5 more auctions which I will show you if there was enough time.  Through out the entire session the hand shown is your hand and you are sitting North and (South) your partner is the dealer.|

pg| ***** 39 ***** |


at|
^B@2^Z@3hondo717: well, my recommendation is 3@S, because as most of you said, you have at least a 9 card fit.  And you also have a singleton diamond,  so all experts would bid 3@S. Remember, trump length is paramount.|

PG| ***** 46 ***** |


at|^B@2^Z@3onoway: hmm   what about bidding 3@S also to push opponents up to where you may set them|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


AT|^B@2^Z@3hondo717: I tend to like to declare if possible, so I would bid 3@S.  However, your heart points are a big minus. It is possible that they can’t make 3@H and you can’t make 3@S. However, in the long run, I still would bid 3@S.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3magiemae: It would make a difference  if the @H bidder was behind you though, wouldn't it?|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


AT|
^B@2^Z@3hondo717: would make it less likely to beat 3@H.  Then, actually would make it more likely for I to bid 3@S.  Remember, they could have a 9 card fit too, so Pard could easily have a singleton.  The only reason not to bid 3@S is if the hearts are behind you and you might push them into a make-able game.|

at|
^B@2^Z@3magiemae: well you have a lot of defense, probably pass.|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


Nt|
^B@2^Z@3hondo717: very good analysis. There are 2 conflicting issues here.  The first is, as most of you said, you have the opponents suit and, you probably only have an 8 card fit.  The reason I say you likely have an 8-card fit is because pard also knows about the trump length rule.  With 6 hearts, he would have bid 3@H.  So you have defense and an 8-card fit, making you want to pass 2@S.|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3 hondo717: however, there is one counter argument.  If you remember, I said it is usually not a good idea to let the opponents play at the 2 level.  So you could make an argument that you should bid 3@H.  The other thing is you might push them to bid 3@S.|

pg| ***** 62 ***** |


at|
hondo717: ah, controversy, good. That is  what makes bridge fun.  You could make an argument either way.  You could pass, because you only have an 8-card fit and they are at the 3 level already.  So you could pass. However, as I said before, shortness in their suit is a big asset on defense. With the singleton and such good hearts, I would tend to bid 3@H. But, as I said, pass is reasonable as well.|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Pear: but you have 8 losing tricks.|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


at|
^B@2^Z@3hondo717: but you should definitely really like shortness in their suit -- worth 4 or 5 points. It’s basically a glass half full or half empty argument. Either is right. I favor 3@H.|

at|^B@2^Z@3cc1313: dial 911.  --ELIZA42: X  --Sunshine07: X  --Pear: dbl|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


nt|
^B@2^Z@3hondo717: I am very impressed. Yes double is correct.  This is known as a balancing double. Even though you only have 6 points. Pard must have something, unless the opponents are extremely conservative.  A "balancing double" is when you bid in the pass out seat.  You are allowed to balance with as few as 6 or 7 points on some hands. The idea being the opponents have limited their hands, so you are playing partner for some cards. Partner may even have 13 or 14 but was unable to bid because did not have a suitable suit or takeout double.

nt|^B@2^Z@3qwyz: What if Ops playing inverted minors?  still X?|

at|^B@2^Z@3hondo717: if opponents playing inverted minors, then they made a mistake as 2@D is forcing. So, for the purposes of this lesson, assume you are playing against expert bidders|

pg| ***** 74 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3
hondo717: Another interesting hand.  I think double is out, because I can almost guarantee you pard would bid diamonds.  So I think the only choices are pass or 3@C. The bid of 3@C just says you have clubs.  The basic idea is if they have a fit, mathematically you have a fit too.|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


at|  

Let me explain why.  |
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3
Assume they have a 9 card fit. Since you and your partner have 26 cards between you, and only 4 of them are in the opponents suit, you and your pard have 22 cards outside their suit. Then, you must have at least one 8  card fit.  Or at worst you have two 7-card fits and one 8-card fit. Therefore,  I would bid 3@C, but would be very nervous when I did so. In fact, vulnerable I probably would not do it.  Your 2 choices are pass or 3@C. The adventurous ones should bid 3@C, conservative ones should pass. |
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3
toniwascok: is 3@C much better than 2@s?|
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


at|
^B@2^Z@3hondo717: Your question is very reasonable, and some people might bid 2@S.  However,  I would like to have a better suit, then  3@C would be my choice.  Here, it is possible we even have a 9 card fit.  With 2@S, we have at best an 8-card fit  because pard would probably overcall with 5@S.|

nt|^B@2^Z@3 
hondo717: good controversy again.  ok, let me ask you this.  If Pard had overcalled spades or hearts, and you had 5 of his suit, what would you bid? |
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


  
at|^B@2^Z@3ELIZA42: 4. Pear: 4 of his suit. |
pg| ***** 85 ***** |

pg| ***** 86 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3hondo717: So this is really no different. you have a known 10 card fit, so you should be comfortable bidding to the 4 level. Remember, I said you should be comfortable bidding based on the number of trumps you have. And here your singleton diamonds is wonderful.  I really think 4@C stands out. |

at|^B@2^Z@3Dianne0516: pass--partner is a passed hand and you might pushthe opponents to a makable game.|
pg| ***** 102 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3hondo717: very good Dianne.  Yes, this hand is a little different. Although 4@C probably works out fine if they let you play it there, I would be afraid of pushing them into  making game.  So unlike the last hand, where I was willing to defend 4@S, I would pass 3@H, because I would   not be happy if they bid 4@H.   I use the following rule for bidding a minor at the 4 level. You have to decide what you are going to do if they bid game over your bid.  If you are not willing to double them if they bid game, then you should not bid 4 of the minor. This is more of a tactical consideration. because if you push them into a makeable game, you will lose a lot of imps. The risk in this case is higher than the reward for bidding 4@C.|

pg| ***** 105 ***** |


at|^b@2^z@3smudge1: what about the clubs? Panim: 4s keeps them from finding a fit.|
pg| ***** 106 ***** |


At|^b@2^z@3hondo717: almost all experts would bid 4@S on this hand. So with a known 10 card fit, you should bid 4@S.  You are making it very hard for the opponents to bid, they might even have a slam.  You could get doubled and go down a lot, but that is unlikely, and if you do, then they are probably cold for a slam.|
pg| ***** 107 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Pear: what percentage of the time does that kind of bid work Pls? |
pg| ***** 108 ***** |


at| ^b@2^z@3hondo717: terry, don’t know for sure, but I would say upwards of 80%. It puts a lot of pressure on the opponents. Sometimes it even gets passed out  and you go for -150 when they make game or slam. |

PG| ***** 111 ***** |


AT|^b @2 ^z@3hondo717: yes, again using the trump length criteria, you should bid 3@H. Basically, if Pard opens a weak 2, and you have 3 card support you should always bid 3 if you have between 5 and 13 HCP.|

^B@2^Z@3The next five puzzles are intended to sharpen your competitive bidding judgment. |
PG| ***** 117 ***** |

^B@2^Z@3Assume you hold the hand shown above for each of the following auctions. For each auction decide what would be your bid and why before clicking the arrow box below the screen for the recommended answer.|
pg| ***** 118 ***** |


nt|
^B@2^Z@3There are not necessarily right or wrong answers. The important thing is to develop some principles that help you judge whether or not to bid, and apply those principles consistently. If you need more explanation send your answers to me at bilpuzzles@bridgesights.com.|
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


at|^B@2^Z@3I define a competitive auction as one in which each side has at least one 8 card fit and the points are relatively even (17-23 HCP for each side). I use the following guidelines for competitive auctions: |
pg| ***** 120 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@31. Do not let the opponents play at the 2 level.
2. If the opponents are already at the 3 level, only compete to the 3 level if you have a nine card fit or a singleton in the opponent's suit.
3. If the decision is close, I tend to discount high cards in the opponent's suit and value high cards in our suit or suits.|

nt|^B@2^Z@3Let us start with the first auction.  Again you are sitting North and your partner is the dealer. |

^B@2^Z@3This is the first puzzle. Study the hand and choose your bid. When done click the arrow box.|
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


NT|
^B@2^Z@3Keeping those guidelines in mind, This is close. We have a 9 card fit, but I have values in hearts. If playing IMPs, I would pass; if playing match points, I would bid 3@S.|

^B@2^Z@3Unlike puzzle 1, I think 3@S is clear. We have a 9 card fit, and all my values are outside clubs,
the opponent's suit. |

^B@2^Z@3Unlike puzzle 3, we only have an 8 card fit. Therefore, since the opponents are already at the
3 level, I pass. We do not have a 9 card fit, and I do not have a singleton club.|
