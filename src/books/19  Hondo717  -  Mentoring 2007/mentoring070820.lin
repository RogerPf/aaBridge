^d @e@2"nome" believes, “You need repetitions when you start bridge late.” So he trails good @E@3 teachers in the BBO. When possible he attends their lectures, mentoring sessions and tournaments. He squirrels away every note and movie of the hands though he cannot find them when he needs them. As a remedy he decided to incorporate some of those hordes in several presentations such as the one you are about to view. 

In this presentation "nome" combined the movie of the hands from hondo717's mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees.  Those are  condensed from the chat log transcript.  

The goal here is presenting to you hondo717's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of graphics.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. Clicking the first will move you forward and clicking the second will take you back. When available there is an explanation for the bid in the gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. 

Further, all the links in this presentation are clickable - it changes color when you roll your cursor over it.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site.




                           Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

hondo717: Here I played a high @C. By playing a high club clearly I am giving count.  Attitude is not appropriate, because clearly with East (terry's) holding, Anne (North) can figure out that I do not have a high card.  I am playing a high club, to show 2 or 4 cards holding. From two cards holding I play the highest and 2nd highest from a four cards holding.

hondo717: your Q@H was a brilliant play.  Then you need to follow up. Anne, I played the 8@H, how many hearts do you think I started with?|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|    Anne: Most likely two.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|

hondo717: Great, before you lead the next heart you need to think about it.   If I had 2, you had 5, board shows 3 that leave 3 for dot. So far, you came up with a brilliant defense.  I would like to make sure it works.  Next, if you play the Ace of hearts, you can give me a heart ruff, and beat the contract. See how smart you were?  Just need to follow through.

Pear (terry): Howard can you comment on the bidding please?|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


at|

hondo717: The first three bids were fine. West (dot) wants to balance and not sell out in 1@H. I am not sure I would bid 2@D though because that shows five cards. I think a better bid might be double, and tell partner "I owe you a club" if partner bids clubs.

Pear: I believe that you should ALWAYS have a 5 card suit to overcall. |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


at|
hondo717: yes, that is a good rule to follow.  However, if dot makes a takeout double, she is supposed to have at least 3 cards in each unbid suit.  So the question is which lie is better.  I think double is better, because terry will strain to bid spades. |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |

hondo717: On the other hand  3@C probably goes down.|

hondo717: Anne, the 3@C is a reverse, showing at least 15 HCP. BTW,  some experts do not play that.  My definition of a reverse is bidding past your suit at the 2 level, if your suit is still available.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


mb|p|nt|
Pear: why is that a reverse Howard ?

hondo717: If I didn’t want to reverse I could bid 2H.  A reverse is defined as deliberately bidding past your suit at the 2 level

Pear: BUT clubs are not available at level 2 ... clarify please.
|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


mb|3N|nt|
hondo717: My original suit is hearts, and I bid past 2 hearts.  A reverse is if you bid past your original suit at the 2 level.  Since I bid past 2 hearts, I made a reverse. Another example of a reverse would have been if I bid 2S. Not appropriate for this hand, but that is a reverse as well.
|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


mb|p|nt|
Pear: Since clubs are lower ranking than @H ... I am a little confused here.

hondo717: I understand. And some people you play  can only reverse into a higher ranking suit, so I see your problem.

Pear: OH .... CLICK!!!  the light went on ... now I understand.

North: I need to count winners and losers out loud or to self. I believe that I have 3 spades, maybe 4 diamonds. 4 clubs  and 1 heart winners.  That is 12 so probably I should have bid slam.

hondo717: its' ok, you are making the effort now, and it will get better as you practice more.  So it turned out 6 clubs is a good contract, but because of the bad diamond break it goes down, so we were lucky.|pc|SA|pc|S4|pc|HQ|

hondo717: East here with your hand the best way to show Hearts support over an over call is a 2@S cue bid showing heart support and a limit raise or better. And my double shows a 2@S raise.

pg| ***** 52 ***** |

hondo717: I strongly discourage the lead of an ace. Aces are meant to take Ks and Qs, so best if you lead something else. A trump is probably safe on this auction  and a club is fine as well.
