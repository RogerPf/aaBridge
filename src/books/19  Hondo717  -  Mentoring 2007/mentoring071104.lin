^d @e@2"nome" believes, “You need repetitions when you start bridge late.” So he trails good @E@3 teachers in the BBO. When possible he attends their lectures, mentoring sessions and tournaments. He squirrels away every note and movie of the hands though he cannot find them when he needs them. As a remedy he decided to incorporate some of those hordes in several presentations such as the one you are about to view. 

In this presentation "nome" combined the movie of the hands from hondo717's mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees.  Those are  condensed from the chat log transcript.  

The goal here is presenting to you hondo717's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. Clicking the first will move you forward and clicking the second will take you back. When available there is an explanation for the bid in the gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. 

Further, all the links in this presentation are clickable - it changes color when you roll your cursor over it.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site. @D@D If interested at the end of each board you can play it double dummy. Use your cursor to select cards from each hand. If not simply push the forward arrow to move to the next board@D@D




                           Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

hondo717: OK, now we need to discuss how to ask for aces in this auction. If you play Gerber, you must define which are Gerber sequences. I play Gerber only in the following 4 cases:
1) 1N opener, 
2) 2N opener, 
3) 2N rebid by opener,
4) 2C followed by 2N rebid |
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


NT|
hondo717: I do not think 4NT as a quantitative bid has any value. The difference between making 6NT and not is almost never a matter of exactly how many high card points you have, but rather whether you have a source of tricks (such as a solid 5+ card suit). So to bid 4NT, asking partner to bid 6NT with 16 or 17, does not make sense. Regardless, you and your partner need to decide when 4@C is Gerber, and you need to be precise. Otherwise 4@C would be ambiguous. |
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


NT|
hondo717: So, anyway, now I am going to bid 4NT as Blackwood to ask for aces and anne plays RKC 1430. However, here some people would play 4@C as Gerber. |

hondo717: In modern bridge, there is lots of interferences over 1NT openers, so you need to decide what to play  and systems on/stolen bid doubles are easy and effective, so I suggest you play them. I really discourage less experienced players playing Leb. it is quite complicated and easy to mess up. |

nT|
hondo717: NP . You can ask for undo after I go over coded 10s and 9s, as they are a source of confusion. In the old days, from holdings such as AJ10 or KJ10, people would lead the J. The problem is, people would also lead the J from J10 with no higher honor. So coded 10s were invented to differentiate between the two holdings. With AJ10 or KJ10, playing coded 10s and 9s, you play the 10. Partner now knows you are leading from a broken sequence or, from top of nothing, it is usually obvious. Conversely, if you lead the J (from J10), partner knows you have no higher honor.|

hondo717: Wait, let me discuss balancing bids. On this type of auction, it is often not a good idea to pass. Opponents have found a fit, so it is likely we have a fit. Therefore, 3@C by anne would not be unreasonable, although pass is ok too. So, do you want an undo to venture a 3@C bid anne? |
PG| ***** 66 ***** |

mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|NT|
hondo717: Now let us discuss the criteria than sarah and terry would use to decide whether or not to bid 3@H. Basically, it comes down to how many trumps they have. If they have a 9 card fit, they should bid 3@H. The basic rule in competitive auctions is the number of trumps determines the number of tricks you can safely bid.  With an 8 card fit, you can contract for 8 tricks, which is the two level. With a 9 card fit, you can contract for 9 tricks, the 3 level. That principle is based on what is known as the "Law of Total Tricks", or LOTT for short. |
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


nt|
hondo717: You might also bid to the 3 level even with an 8 card fit, if you have a singleton in the opponent’s suit. Therefore, unless they either have a 9 card fit or a singleton club, terry and sarah should pass. |
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


AT|
Pear: I don’t think Sarah has a LOTT of hearts, if Sarah had 4 @Hs I think she would have made some another bid ... so I will pass. |

hondo717: sarah's choice of opening bid is interesting. She could pass, so you have to decide what a weak 2 in 4th seat means. It should show 6 card suit, and 9 or 10 HCP. With a weaker hand, sarah should pass. |

NT|
hondo717: Well, the bad break was unfortunate. On balance, I think pass is better than 2@D. There is another rule that some people use to guide them as to whether to open or not in 4th seat. It is known as the rule of 15. In 4th seat, if your high card points + spades add up to at least 15, you can open. The thinking behind that rule is that with spades, you can always compete. I do not particularly care for that rule, but just wanted to let you know about it.|
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


NT|
hondo717: As far as the play of the hand, sarah did well. The idea is to score as many small trumps as possible by ruffs. When you have a weak trump suit, that is a good strategy to follow.|

AT|   hondo717: Yes I would. Some people say a coded 10 shows "zero or two higher." That is true, but not sufficient. For example, from Qj10, you have 2 higher than the 10 but you lead the Q. With 2 higher, the 10 specifically shows AJ10 or KJ10. Similarly, the 9 shows A109, K109, Q109, or top of nothing. So you can forget "zero or two higher" and remember what I just said.|

hondo717: sarah's observation is right on. However, I thought we might beat 3N, so I passed. We actually do pretty well in 4@H. Lose 1 trick in each suit, only down 1. So 4@H would have worked out well. We might lose a 2nd diamond, because terry can draw 3 rounds of trump. Because even down 2 doubled is better than their making 3NT. More so in match points, because the difference between -500 and -600 is around 3 imps.|

hondo717: Spades were a good play, and in this case, didn’t matter what spade you played sarah, since dummy is good if I don’t have A of spades. However, a more elegant play was the K of spades, trapping dummy's Q and setting up my J. When there is a singleton honor in dummy, it is sometimes a good play to play a higher honor trapping dummy's honor.|

hondo717: terry's bid is good. However, he has another choice, a "help suit game try." If terry bids 3@D instead of 3 spades, he is asking anne to bid 4@S under one of two conditions:
          First if she has a max 2@S bid - 8 or 9 points;
          Second, if anne only has 6 or 7 points, but they are in @Ds and @Ss.
So 3@D is a slightly better bid than 3@S, although 3@S is very reasonable.|

hondo717: And why are you not drawing trump terry? You don’t want us to score our low trumps. It was good to take care of diamonds before drawing trump, but you should always draw trump as soon as possible.  You should always draw trumps first unless there is a good reason not to. In this case terry had to take care of his diamond losers, but once that was done, he could then draw trumps.|

hondo717: sarah, it is good that you consider leading a trump, although a diamond (which you selected first) is not unreasonable. When you are long in an opponent’s first bid suit (spades in this case), and they end up in a second suit, often a trump works out well.|

^d@e@2Late at night on November 7, 2007, Howard successfully finished another one of his mentoring @E@3 sessions. I started kibbing his sessions late Spring 2007. I started doing the movies later. Two days a week for almost two hours I watched the mentees learn the game under Howard’s tutelage. My journey started when all I knew about this particular card game was that the King of Hearts was the only king who did not have a mustache. His mentee’s names, Anne, Sarah and Terry soon became household names for me.   

I watched them make mistakes, and get undone.  I could literally feel their difficulty in answering his gentle questions.  You could even see it when Terry mentioned that he is blushing. But their level of playing bridge improved every week.  And the improvement was obvious. During their last session they put up a stunning show of mastery of the game. The Kibbers stayed glued to the screen and asked questions and learned along with the three mentees. 

On the other hand, I think I have been the biggest winner of them all. Because now at least my hand count is  “reasonable.” Those who know Howard well would agree with me that “reasonable” is the word he uses when he does not want to embarrass you and tell you it really stinks.

He also taught me to be more patient, gentle, kind, considerate and respectful to others, and to listen more and say less. He convinced me that it takes time to be a “reasonable” good player. So I have to replace the old adage with  “Yes you can teach an old dog a few tricks.”   I am the old dog and he taught me more than a few tricks. I know that my sentiments are shared by many of BBO and BIL members when I simply say,

              
                     @h@h@h@h@h THANK YOU HOWARD - WE ALL LOVE YOU @h@h@h@h

                          
nd length in the opponents suit, that is a negative in terms of your wanting to play the hand. Further, with 4 hearts and points in hearts, you should suspect a misfit, so pass is best. |

^d@e@2Bergen Raises are used by responder after partner opens one of a major and responder has 4 @E@3 cards in the opener's suit. Reverse Bergen, which I recommend, works as follows. Responder must have exactly 4 card support. With 5-6 points, responder jumps to 3 of the major, with 7 to a bad 9 responder bids 3 diamonds (known as a constructive raise"), with a good 9 to 11 responder bids 3 clubs (known as a "limit raise"), and with 12 or more responder bids 2NT (the usual Jacoby 2N raise played by many partnerships.)

One of the important advantages of Bergen Raises is the preemptive jump raise (with 5-6 points.) Modern competitive bidding theory says it is safe to compete to the 3 level with a 9 card fit, and Bergen Raises allow You to do this in a way that preempts the opponents.

If the intervening opponent bids, Bergen Raises no longer apply. I suggest you play the following methods over interference. If the opponent bids a suit, a cue bid shows a limit raise (9-11) with 4 card support. A jump raise shows less than a limit raise (5-8) with 4 card support. Over a takeout double, 2NT shows a limit raise or better with 4 card support (this convention is known as Jordan 2NT.) And a jump raise still shows less than a limit raise (5-8) with 4 card support.

Some people play regular Bergen rather than Reverse Bergen. The idea is basically the same, only the meaning of the 3 club and 3 diamond bids are reversed, 3@C showing 7 to a bad 9 and 3@D showing a good 9 to 11. The reason I prefer Reverse Bergen is that you want to explore for game more often over a limit raise than a constructive raise, and Reverse Bergen gives your partnership more room to explore. However, if your partner insists on playing regular Bergen, most of the value of Bergen Raises still applies.

@d@d                       THE END                   @d@d
