^d @e@2"nome" believes, “You need repetitions when you start bridge late.” So he trails good @E@3 teachers in the BBO. When possible he attends their lectures, mentoring sessions and tournaments. He squirrels away every note and movie of the hands though he cannot find them when he needs them. As a remedy he decided to incorporate some of those hordes in a presentation such as the one you are about to view. 

In this presentation "nome" combined the movie of the hands from hondo717's mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees.  Those are  condensed from the chat log transcript.  

The goal here is presenting to you hondo717's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of graphics.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. Clicking the first will move you forward and clicking the second will take you back. When available there is an explanation for the bid in the gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. 

Further, all the links in this presentation are clickable - it changes color when you roll your cursor over it.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site.




                           Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

hondo717: As far as the bidding goes, I could also make several other bids besides 4@S. I was a bit aggressive in inviting game, since North (sarah) might only have 6 points.  I could also bid 3@S, and sarah should go to 4 since her 2@S bid showed less than 10 points.  But with one more point sarah you should bid 3S to invite me to 4.  Or I could have bid 3S and sarah would bid 4 since she has a max for her 2 spade bid.  The other thing I could bid is 3@D.

hondo717: Bidding is a bit aggressive on my part. Now I will plan the hand.  Based on the lead I have no diamond losers.  I have no heart losers, one spade loser, and one club loser. So as long as clubs and spades behave, I should make 5. So my plan is to draw trumps and then set up clubs, and ruff a diamond in dummy.  In general, draw trumps ASAP unless a good reason not to.

hondo717: In evaluating my hand I counted the Q of hearts as 2 points, since North bid hearts. As it turned out, it could have just as well been the 2 of hearts in this hand.  When deciding whether to count hcp or distribution, with a singleton honor, I count whatever is more, the distribution or the singleton.  With a singleton K, I count 3 points, and none for the singleton.  For Q I count 2 points (either the Q or the singleton, but not both) and with singleton J, count 2 points for the singleton.|

hondo717: After East rebinds 2NT, West (dot) with 6 card hearts suit, should transfer to hearts even though you end up playing it.  On this auction, you treat it the same as if East (anne) opened 2N.  3@C is stayman, 3@D is heart transfer, and 3@H is spade transfer.

hondo717: At first I assumed dot's first bid was just the 2H negative bid, not hearts. We will discuss bidding over 2@C later.

pc|ST|pc|D9|pc|D8|pc|S8|nt|hondo717: ok, let us talk about how to bid when pard opens 2@C.  Typically, these days you almost always bid 2@D over 2 clubs.  That can either be negative or "waiting." You only bid a suit if you have a 5+ card suit with 2 of the top 3 honors and 8+ points.  Bids of 2@H, 2@S, 3@C, and 3@D all show 5+ cards with AQ, AK, KQ or AKQ.  In this case dot would normally bid 2@D.  You could make a case for her to bid 2@H, since her suit is quite good, but she does not have 2 of top 3 honors.

Now, let us assume dot bid 2@D, when East bids 2N, the auction reverts to being the same as if East opened 2N in the first place. Here, West  would bid 3@D transfer (or 4@D if you play Texas transfer), and East would bid 3H (or 4H.) 3@C over 2N, would be Stayman.

hondo717: I have a hand that is hard to evaluate.  It only has 13HCP, but it is 5/5, with a singleton spade, which is particularly good.  So I should at least  invite to game, or possibly just bid it. If  North (sarah) has the perfect 5 count (K of hearts Q of diamonds), I will make 4 while  we only have 18 HCP. Next fram.|

pc|SA|pc|S6|pc|S3|pc|S8|nt|
hondo717: however, I was a bit more cautious, and bid 3@D asking sarah to bid 4@H with a max or with a diamond card.  sarah, you should  evaluate her hand in the context of the auction.  I agree with your bid.  You have max in terms of points (8 hcp). However, there are a lot of negatives.  The Q of spades is probably not that useful for one thing, the singleton diamond is not good  and you only have 3 hearts not 4. So you really have a low end of a min in the context of this auction.  If, for example, you switched your spades and diamonds, you would have a clear 4H bid with the same number of hcp, but a much better hand.

hondo717: Now let us see what my plan is. I have 2 diamonds and a club winners for sure.  So I need to come to seven trump tricks, or else set up a trick somewhere else. Probably the best way is to try and set up diamonds.  I will ruff two diamonds, and hope to lose just a club and a trump.  Again,  the important point is I have a plan.  If you get in the habit of looking over the whole hand, and coming up with a plan, counting your winners and losers, your declarer play will improve.

hondo717: The bidding now is standard and correct thanks to my undo button. East had difficulty finding the proper bid in response to 3@D. After the play I will discuss why it is so important to bid correctly.|

hondo717: I  thought West  had a good plan, but then she switched.  Playing clubs was very good. With that plan you guarantee that you will take 4@H, 2@S, 2@D and 2@C for 10 sure tricks.  However, you started playing clubs and then stopped, not sure why.  Had the spade finesse lost, you would have only taken 9 tricks, so not sure why you didn’t just play another club.

^d@e@2hondo717: now, let us talk about why it is important to bid correctly, and how partner @E@3 takes certain inferences from what you bid or do not bid.  For example in this hand East bid stayman, promising at least one 4 card major. Since East bid 3@D, there is no reason for East to show a 4 card major.  So if she bids she bid hearts at after 3@D that must be 5 hearts and 4 spades. Because if East just had 5 hearts and not 4 spades, she would have simply transferred to hearts by bidding 3@D.   If the auction went 2N-3@C-3@D-3@H, East is showing 5@H and 4@S. To say it differently, in response to NT if you have 5/4 major you bid Stayman first then show your five cards major. The point is expert partners take inferences by what you did and did not. 
 
 hondo717: Let me talk about "negative inferences" in the bidding.  Expert partners infer things about their pard's hand by what they did not bid as well as what they did bid.  Here is a very simple example.   Say I open 1D and partner bids 1N.  Because pard DID NOT bid 1H or 1S, I know pard cannot have a 4 card major. “Negative inferences” are very important, and it is why you must always strive to make the correct bid.
