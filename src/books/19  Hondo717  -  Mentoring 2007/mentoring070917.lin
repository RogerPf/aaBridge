^d @e@2"nome" believes, “You need repetitions when you start bridge late.” So he trails good @E@3 teachers in the BBO. When possible he attends their lectures, mentoring sessions and tournaments. He squirrels away every note and movie of the hands though he cannot find them when he needs them. As a remedy he decided to incorporate some of those hordes in several presentations such as the one you are about to view. 

In this presentation "nome" combined the movie of the hands from hondo717's mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees.  Those are  condensed from the chat log transcript.  

The goal here is presenting to you hondo717's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. Clicking the first will move you forward and clicking the second will take you back. When available there is an explanation for the bid in the gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. 

Further, all the links in this presentation are clickable - it changes color when you roll your cursor over it.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site.




                           Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

hondo717: My undo is Just a reminder to North on defensive carding. Always play the lowest card of a sequence when playing 3rd hand high.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|

hondo717: It is important that you play the correct card on defense, in this case sarah should play the 10 of spades on the first trick instead of Q.  Otherwise partner will get a bad picture of the hand.  Even though the Q is the equivalent, playing the Q denies the J (and 10), so I will assume anne has those cards.  You play the lowest card you can in a sequence.|

hondo717: That gives partner the most information. |

ydannac: is this the coded 9-10? |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |

hondo717: no, coded 10s and 9s have to do with opening leads.  You probably have heard me saying it before, “As a general defensive carding, always play the lowest card in the sequence when playing 3rd hand high.”|

======================================  2
qx|o2|pn|hondo717,Pear,laz64md,ydannac|st||md|4S49TKAH4D489QAC8T,S23JQH27KAD6JC37K,S7H35JQD257TC469Q,|rh||ah|Board 2|sv|n|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|         hondo717: Here, I will discuss the bidding as we go forward. 

There is not much Terry could do now.  The reason being, if you overcalled with a weak hand against a good pair, they would often double you, and you could go down a lot. Once an opponent opens, there are fewer points available for your partner to have.|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


mb|1N|nt|
hondo717: ok, first sarah's question about her bidding.  She is a point short of bidding 1NT, so should she bid at all, since she is short in spades. My answer may surprise you, since as you will see later that her bidding 1NT actually will work out well for us. However, if you sense a misfit, it is best if you stay as low as possible, so I would have passed with sarah's hand. The reason being, you could get in trouble. For example, suppose I had a 16 point hand and jumped to 3 spades.  Or I bid 3NT.  Basically, a good rule to follow is, if you have a fit with partner it is ok to stretch, but it is better to be conservative if you have a possible misfit.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


mb|p|mb|2D|nt|
hondo717: Now, let us look at Terry's hand again. Over the first bid, Terry could not bid even though he has an opening hand.  In fact, with his 4 spades, he should sense we have a misfit, so pass is very right.  Some of you may remember I have said in the past, "if the opponents have a fit, you probably have a fit" too. Well, the reverse is true as well. "if the opponents have a misfit, you probably have a misfit" too. |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|
The question is, should Terry do anything over 2@D. If Terry is in a frisky mood, he now might try a double, showing hearts and clubs, particularly being not vulnerable. Similarly, anne could double instead of passing the hand out. Yes hearts do split badly, but they do have an 8 card fit.  So I think it is reasonable for both Terry and anne to pass, but if either of them wanted to venture a double, that would not be a terrible bid, particularly since they are not vulnerable. Basically, you should not like it if the opponents play at the 2 level and you think the HCP are evenly split.|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|
hondo717: Now, I need to count my losers and winners and come up with a plan.  I have one heart and two club losers for sure. but I also have to figure out how to take 8 tricks. Assume I can get a couple of ruffs in dummy, and say 3 diamonds in my hand. Those are 5 tricks.   I also have 2 spades for  total of 7.  So I need an eight trick somewhere, either a 4th diamond in my hand, or a heart.|

hondo717: well that lead sets up 2 heart tricks for me, which makes life much easier.|

hondo717: ok, now there is only 1 spade out, if Terry is out, I am in good shape, if anne is out, I will have to ruff high to at least force out a high trump. It is important you count out the key suits, not just the trump suit. I know anne is out, so I have to trump high.|

hondo717: sarah,  the problem with 3@S bid is it promises 4 spades.  You should always count your distribution once you have found a fit. let us change the bid to 2 spades if you don’t mind, sarah, because it is a correct bid for your hand and makes it more interesting for anne's hand.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


UB||MB|2S|mb|3H|nt|
hondo717: ok, now anne, do you think you and Terry might have game? Is your 3@H bid a good one? Also, based on the bidding, you know Terry is short in spades. You should assume you have a 9 card heart fit, you won’t always, but you will most of the time.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|
hondo717: sarah, why did you decide to bid 3S instead of passing?  I actually think now it is the correct bid for your hand. For those of you who went to my lesson on competitive bidding last week, this is a good hand. Based on the number of trumps, sarah should pass. If you remember, I said you should count the number of trumps you have and bid to that level.  Then if you have 8 trumps, ok to bid for 8 tricks (the 2 level), and 9 trumps the 3 level (9 tricks.)|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT|
Using those criteria, sarah should pass. However, I also said you should value shortness in their suit and concentration of points in your suit. Since sarah is short in their suit, and she has a very good 2S bid, based on HCP, on balance, I think 3S is a good bid|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt|
hondo717: It is best if you have some criteria for competing, rather than just relying on your intuition. That is what I am trying to get across here. As a recap, the criteria I suggested were;  a) the number of trumps you have, and b) shortness in their suit and c) concentration of points in your suit.  For those of you who missed my lesson, it is posted on my web site  along with a bridge movie of the entire lesson with all the student comments  at ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge.^*N|

hondo717: ok sarah, I am inviting.  I already know you have 15-17. So I am asking if you are closer to 17 than 15. Since you only have 15, pass is probably better. However, if you make 4, you will make the teacher look silly, lol. |

However, there is a slightly better bid which is  3@D and is  known as a "help suit game try." It says, "partner, I would like to invite you to bid game with the right hand."
 
Pratner should bid 4 with either some diamond cards, or a maximum count for 2@S bid.  Basically,  roberta if you had for example 7 points, say the A of spades and K of diamonds, you should bid 4@S.  You should also bid 4@S if you just generally had a good 9 count.  Now,  you have a pretty meager 2@S bid, and 3@D does not improve your hand, so 3@S bid is clear.  Had bertt bid 3@H, you have a better hand, but your Q of clubs does not look promising, so I probably would still bid 3@S, but 4@S could be right in that case.|

hondo717: ok, bertt, you have a slightly better line that may work if we don’t defend carefully. When you count your losers you see 2 hearts and 2 diamonds for sure. However, if you play me for the J of diamonds, you can get to the board with the J of spades, and lead a low diamond towards the 10.  You can then get to the board with the 10 of spades, and lead another low diamond.  Unless I figure out to give sally a diamond ruff, you will then make the hand, because you will only lose 2 diamonds. Since you have limited entries to the board, you should play diamonds early.|

hondo717: ok, let me discuss my philosophy about weak 2s, which is different than other experts.  Many experts do not like to open weak 2s with an outside 4 card major.  and that is certainly a reasonable way to play.  However, I do not play that way. I feel that the advantages of a weak 2 far outweigh occasionally missing a 4-4 major suit game, so I believe you should open a weak 2 with any hand with a 6 card suit and 5-10 points  even with a bad suit.  Again, that is not the mainstream opinion, but I just happen to feel that my approach works out better. |
pg| ***** 106 ***** |


mb|p|nt| 
hondo717: Let me also discuss an alternative response when partner bids 2NT over your weak 2.  Many people play 2NT asks for a feature, an outside A or K  and that is a reasonable way to play. I prefer, however. another convention known as "Ogust." With Ogust, the weak 2 bidder describes 2 characteristics about his hand. Whether he has a good hand (8-10 HCP) or a bad hand (5-7 HCP) and : and whether he has a good suit (2 of the top 3 honors) or a bad suit (not 2 of the top 3 honors.)  Ogust works as follows. If partner bids 2NT, you respond as follows: |

hondo717: if you have the best hand you can have, a "good hand" (8-10) and "good suit", you bid 3@S, if you have a "good hand" but bad suit, you bid  3@H and  if you have the worst hand you can have, (a "bad hand" (5-7) and a "bad suit"), you bid 3@C, the lowest bid.  Finally, you bid 3@D  and if you have a bad hand but a good suit. |

hondo717: So basically, Ogust allows you to open a weak 2 with a wide variety of hands, and partner still has a way of finding out what type of weak 2 you are bidding.  Usually, responder needs one honor in your suit, and at least an opening hand  to bid 2NT over your weak 2 opening.  |

hondo717: ok, back to opening leads.  Here are the guidelines I use:
A. first, I tend not to lead suits that opponents bid. Here  I am talking about suits, although that rule also applies in NT too.
B. I tend to like sequences. Here  since spades were not bid, a spade was a good lead, in fact the best lead as it turns out. I think that  the 10 of spades is slightly better than the 6 of spades. |

C.  It is almost never right to lead an ace against a suit contract, or under-lead an ace  Avoid leading an Ace if at all possible.  The  only exceptions are 1) against slam and 2) if partner bid the suit and you have a doubleton. Aces are made to take Ks and Qs, so if you lead an ace you almost always give up a trick on defense. I strongly advise you to resist it  when you have the urge to lead an ace.|

pc|D9|pc|C2|pc|S5|pc|S8|nt|hondo717: Very well played. I was a bit conservative in the bidding.  Since I only had 2 hearts and 9 points, and you only bid 2H, not 3H, I thought game was remote. Theoretically, you can lose 4 tricks (1 spade, 1 diamond, and 2 clubs, but with careful play, you can discard a spade.  So 4@H is a good game.|

bertt: so I should bid 3@h?|

hondo717: no, your suit is not that good, and you only have 15 points.  Just one of those hands where we both were at the top of our ranges, and neither really made a mistake.|

hondo717: ok, normally I would lead a spade, as I believe in 4th best leads, but obviously that would be silly in this case, so I will choose my next best suit.|

hondo717: however, I do believe that 4th best leads work out best in the long run. other experts will tell you to lead unbid majors, and that sometimes works, but my experience is 4th is the best.  Has worked out the best for me over the long run.  again, this assumes the opponents have not bid the suit  and partner has not bid a suit. If partner bids a suit, ALWAYS lead it.  If it is wrong, it is your partner's fault. You, probably have heard me saying,  "You cannot lose the post mortem by leading partner's suit." |
