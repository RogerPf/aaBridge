^d @e@2"nome" believes, “You need repetitions when you start bridge late.” So he trails good @E@3 teachers in the BBO. When possible he attends their lectures, mentoring sessions and tournaments. He squirrels away every note and movie of the hands though he cannot find them when he needs them. As a remedy he decided to incorporate some of those hordes in several presentations such as the one you are about to view. 

In this presentation "nome" combined the movie of the hands from hondo717's mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees.  Those are  condensed from the chat log transcript.  

The goal here is presenting to you hondo717's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. Clicking the first will move you forward and clicking the second will take you back. When available there is an explanation for the bid in the gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. 

Further, all the links in this presentation are clickable - it changes color when you roll your cursor over it.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site.|

hondo717: Bidding is acceptable. My plan to play this hand.  First, I will  count my tricks. Since I only have one  spade stopper, I have to take 9 tricks before letting the opponents in again. Otherwise, I will lose at least 4 spades plus whatever I let them in with.  I have 3 diamonds, 3 hearts, and 1 spade for sure|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


at|
 
hondo717: my best hope is that diamonds are 3-2, so that I can take 5 diamonds, for a total of 9 tricks.  If I had 2 spade stoppers, I would knock out the A of clubs to guarantee 9 tricks, since that would set up 3 club tricks. Further, I hold four hearts in the dummy.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|
hondo717: however, I can’t afford to do that with this hand. Therefore,  I will duck 2 spades anyway, in case sarah started with 3, diamonds don’t break, and sarah has the A of clubs. That gives me another chance if diamonds don’t break.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


pc|SJ|pc|S5|pc|S7|pc|S2|NT|
hondo717: good signal terry, but you might as well have played the 8.  Play the highest card you can afford when signaling.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


AT|
Pear: ok ... didn't realize it made a difference sorry.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


at|
hondo717: it normally doesn’t, but it is best to be as clear as possible when signaling, and the 8 is higher than the 7, so gives sarah an even more emphatic signal.|

hondo717: ok, now I am also playing diamonds carefully, because I can handle certain 4-1 breaks. If sarah started with 4, and terry started with a singleton 10 or J.  I can discover that by playing the A of diamonds first, then a diamond to the Q to  pick up certain 4-1 breaks as well. Normally, these plays make no difference, but every once in a while they work, and you make a contract that others go down in.  In this hand since diamonds are 3-2 doesn’t matter|

pg| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|
hondo717: no, not enough points.  And a void in spades is very bad. On the other hand having 4 hearts also makes you want to play defense.|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


sb|n|mb|p|mb|p|nt|
hondo717: ok, with normal breaks, I will take 6 spades and 2 clubs. It is possible to make more if clubs behave.|

pc|H4|pc|D5|nt|
hondo717: Here I will pitch a diamond, because sarah is probably ruffing this trick.  The reason I know that is two fold,  first, sarah played high low and  second, terry opened 1 hearts, showing 5, and anne had 4. that means hearts are likely 2-2 between sarah and I.  So I might as well pitch a diamond, since that is a losing trick anyway, and if sarah doesn’t ruff, I win the trick|

hondo717: There were 7 trumps out against me originally, but sarah ruffed, and they both followed, so now there are 4 out and  I can draw trumps for sure, even if they are split 3-1.  Better yet, they were split 2-2, so none are left.|

The only thing left is clubs. I will play for a 2-2 break, or the Q dropping.  On this hand it doesn’t matter, but if I needed 5 club tricks I need to be a little careful here.|

hondo717: On the K of clubs, I will pitch the  ten, so I don’t block the suit. I can overtake my 6 with dummy's 9 if need be. Thus,  I would normally be in a position to take 2 more club tricks. Had I not pitched the 10, the suit would be blocked.|

sb|s3H is reasonable.|

at|
hondo717: that is why I like to open weak 2s whenever possible, even with an outside 4 card major. Puts pressure on the opponents. |

pc|H2|nt| 
hondo717: Now, let me discuss my heart lead.  I have 3 small hearts. Had I supported you, I would play top of nothing.  However, since I did not support you, I will lead low to show you 3. That way you can distinguish between my having 2 or 3. I t is more important normally that you know my count, than whether or not I have an honor. |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


pc|H5|pc|HT|nt|
BTW,  nice play of the 10 anne. I see you remember to play lowest of an honor sequence as 3rd hand.|

pc|SQ|pc|S8|nt| 
hondo717: I am going to play a reasonably high spade, to show an even number. In this case it must be 4, because if I only had 2, Terry would have more spades, and probably would have raised spades. So, if I have 4, how many spades does Terry have anne?|

hondo717: Now, unless Terry can take 9 tricks in spades and clubs, you will beat the hand because you now have one diamond and 2 more heart tricks, which gives us a total of 5.|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


at|
ydannac: wanted to save my A@S till later.|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


at|
hondo717: well you could have ducked also. Since terry only had one spades, might as well take the A@S, since you also have A@D as entry.  If terry had 2, then you should duck.|

pg| ***** 84 ***** |


at|
hondo717: Yes, I can also see that we can take 3 clubs. The K@C or the A@C if you play A from AK  is  a  better lead. In a suit, if you hold AK of an unbid suit, that is often a good lead.|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


at|
ydannac: from just AK you play the A is this correct hondo, and from AKxx you play the K.|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |

hondo717: To answer your question, yes, if you play A then K on opening lead, that specifically shows AK doubleton, if you normally lead K from AKx|sk||

karseng: this is just my opinion but would it not have been better to establish a cross ruff?|
pg| ***** 132 ***** |


at|
hondo717: yes, karseng, a cross ruff is a reasonable line. will discuss that in a minute.|
pg| ***** 133 ***** |


at|
 
hondo717: let us first discuss the bidding.  The auction was fine through 3@D.  After that, one possible bid you can make is 3H sarah.  In that kind of auction, it asks your partner to bid 3N if he has a heart stopper. I you had a heart stopper, you would bid 3N, so in this case, bidding terry's suit asks me about a heart stopper. And it turns out 3N is the easiest contract to make.|
pg| ***** 134 ***** |


at|
laz64md: I didn't think about NT because of Terry 's bid, but that makes all day.|

hondo717: if you just draw trumps, and assume the A of hearts is onside, you can count 5 diamond tricks, 2 spades, 1 heart, and 2 clubs.  That is only 10 tricks, so you need one more. Your best bet is to try and ruff 2 clubs in dummy, to give you an extra diamond trick a total of 6. Cash the A of spades, and then lead a heart.  Hopefully, you can handle the entries such that you can take 11 tricks. So better planning would help, but still difficult to make.|

hondo717: Now, I have a question for you sarah. If I open 1N and you bid 2@S, what does that mean?|
pg| ***** 151 ***** |


at|
laz64md: that would have been a transfer to minors and I would have had to correct to diamonds if you bid clubs, I thought of bidding 2NT but I didn't know that would tell you I had at least 5/5 in the minors ... so I was trying to describe my hand.|
pg| ***** 152 ***** |


at|
hondo717: I understand. I am trying to get us there. that is why I am asking you the question.|
pg| ***** 153 ***** |


nt| 
hondo717: ok, good. Then if anne had passed you  would bid 2@S over 1NT. You can still bid 2@S.|
pg| ***** 154 ***** |


at|
laz64md: I know, but since I would end up in 3 diamonds, my 3@D bid tells you I have 7 doesn't it. |
pg| ***** 155 ***** |


at|

hondo717: The difference is 3@D is stronger than bidding 2@S followed by 3@D. A bid of 3@D is forcing to game. if you can bid 3@D over 2@H, you should bid 3@D over a pass as well. If possible, even over interference, you should make the same bid you would have made, in this case, 2@S. So we will undo in a minute.|
pg| ***** 156 ***** |


nt|
hondo717: Now, before we have an undo, let us answer terry's and anne's questions. Anne asked how you show 4/4 in the minors. With DONT,if you bid 2@C, that shows clubs and another suit. So with clubs and diamonds you bid 2@C. Next, you will see my guidelines for DON’T. You can bid it with as little as 4/4 in your 2 suits, but you should have at least an opening hand. With 5/4, you should have say at least 10 or 11. With 5/5 you can have fewer points. And your points should be concentrated in your suits if possible. For example, if you only have a 4 card suit, you should have at least 2 of top 5 honors.|
pg| ***** 157 ***** |


nt| 
hondo717: Let me recap my guidelines for DON’T.
	First of all, your suits should tend to be fairly good, at least 2 honors;
 	Second, with 4/4 only do it with opening hand;
 	With 5/4 can do it with slightly less, say 10 or 11, particularly with good suits;
	with 5/5 can do it with even less;
	DONT does not guarantee one suit is better than the other;
	Finally, you double if you have a six card suit. Then you lose the penalty double in NT if you use DONT. Now let us ubdo.|

hondo717: down 1 terry, very unlucky hand for you. As it turns out it doesn’t matter, but you should have finessed heart.|

Pear: will 5@S make with correct play pls Howard?|

hondo717: No, you are always down 1 terry. You would make 4. This hand shows the power of distribution.|

ydannac: would Sarah had made 5@D?|
pg| ***** 181 ***** |


at|
hondo717: No, because the diamond finesse loses.|
pg| ***** 182 ***** |


nt|
hondo717: Terry, once anne bids 2@H, showing hearts and spades, both sarah's hand and your hand become very powerful.  Down 1, but you were very unlucky to go down in 5@S That was the right bid though. Terry's hand is very powerful because when you have a double fit, in this case both hearts and spades, you can take many tricks with few points. And, from sarah's  perspective, she is very short in anne's suits, so her hand is very powerful as well.  My only suggestion is that terry should bid 4@S right away over sarah's 2@S. It puts a lot of pressure on oppnents. |

analisals: So do you play systems on over interference Hondo?|
pg| ***** 185 ***** |


at|

hondo717: For my students, I recommend they play "systems on/stolen bid doubles" when the opponents interfere over their NT. So, that means any bid that the responder makes means the same thing as if the opponents had not interfered. And "stolen bid doubles" means that if responder doubles, he is saying the bid the opponent made is the same thing as what he would have bid had there not been interference.|
pg| ***** 186 ***** |


nt|
hondo717: In this hand 2@S meant the same thing as if anne had not bid 2@H. On the other hand, if sarah had doubled 2@H, that means, she would have bid 2@H (which would be a spade transfer.) But. if anne had bid 2C, a double by sarah would be stayman. Or if anne had bid 2@D, a double by sarah would be a heart transfer. Finally, in this case for example,  just theoretically, if responder wanted to show hearts, and did not want to pass, he could either bid 3@H (since 1NT-P-3@H shows hearts) or 2NT.|

analisals: Is that strictly partnership agreement ? |
pg| ***** 188 ***** |


at|
hondo717: Yes. When I open strong NTs, I play “systems on, stolen bid doubles.” Some people play a convention called “Lebensohl”, but systems on is fine for me. Lebensohl is a very complicated system and I don’t recommend you play it now.|
pg| ***** 189 ***** |


nt| 
hondo717: ok, now regarding sarah's observation about points.  Points are often a good guideline, but on distributional hands, they often don’t mean a whole lot. Marty Bergen (yes the guy who invented "Bergen Raises") wrote a book called "Points Schmoints" which I highly recommend.|

canbid: with 10 trumps missing king as here , is it better to play for drop or finesse ?|
pg| ***** 191 ***** |


at|
karseng: definitely finesse here... south cannot have singleton king.|
pg| ***** 192 ***** |


at|
hondo717: Better to play for the finesse in general. And karseng is right, I can’t have singleton K. In other circumstances still right to finesse. You will also pick up 3-0 break onside. The only time it is wrong is if singleton K offside, which is reasonably low percentage.|
