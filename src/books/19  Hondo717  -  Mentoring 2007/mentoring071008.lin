^d @e@2"nome" believes, “You need repetitions when you start bridge late.” So he trails good @E@3 teachers in the BBO. When possible he attends their lectures, mentoring sessions and tournaments. He squirrels away every note and movie of the hands though he cannot find them when he needs them. As a remedy he decided to incorporate some of those hordes in several presentations such as the one you are about to view. 

In this presentation "nome" combined the movie of the hands from hondo717's mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees.  Those are  condensed from the chat log transcript.  

The goal here is presenting to you hondo717's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. Clicking the first will move you forward and clicking the second will take you back. When available there is an explanation for the bid in the gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. 

Further, all the links in this presentation are clickable - it changes color when you roll your cursor over it.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site.




                           Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

hondo717: ok, here a 3@S bid is stronger than 4@S. The reason being, we are forced to game. So if I jump to game I am not interested in exploring for slam. But if I bid 3@S, gives us more room to explore. |

hondo717: we could play specific kings, but here I assumed not. However, you can’t decide based on what hand you have. You have to decide before hand. If you play number of kings, then 6@c = 0, 6@d = 1, 6@h = 2, 6@s = 3 with either 1430 or 0314.|

^d@e@2hondo717: First of all, although it made it was not a good slam. It needs 2-2 break, which @E@3is only about 35%.  |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


at|

From my perspective, the hand is a bit weak for 2@C. For 2@C bid I like to have a 9 trick hand. In ben's case you can count 3.5 spades, 1 H, 1C, and 1.25 diamonds or so.  Far less than a 9 trick hand. With his hand, I would just open 1@S. However, let me take the auction as it went. |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


at|
  
In response  to 2@C, most now play 2@D as a "waiting" bid. It basically denies a good suit by responder. A good suit is defined as 5+ cards, and 2 of the top 3 honors. For example, AQxxx. So unless you have a good suit, you bid 2@D. Some people play 2@H to show a bad hand, no aces or kings. If you play that, and if you have a good heart suit, you have to bid 2NT which is rather confusing. |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


at|

2@C is always a game force, some don’t play that, but many do. After my 2@D bid ben showed his spades (2@S bid.) As I mentioned before we are in a game force situation. Therefore, 3@S is stronger than 4@S, because it gives us more room to explore.  However, I was close to bidding 4@S, but with my 4 spades and good hearts decided 3 spades was better than 4 spades. Then ben showed slam interest by bidding his diamonds, and I showed further interest by bidding my hearts. |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


at|

Now let me discuss roman key card Blackwood, and why one plays 0314 or 1430. If you play 1430, then the Blackwood bidder can ask about the Q of trumps if he gets a 5@C or 5@D response which is ambiguous about the Q of trump. The way to ask for Q of trump is to bid the next higher non-trump suit over the responder's bid. |

^d@e@2So, if I responded 5@C, and ben bid 5@D he would be asking me for the Q of trumps. And, @E@3if I bid 5@D and ben bid 5@H, he would also be asking me about the Q of trumps. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


at|

Assume ben wants to do the Q ask. If he did, responder rebids the trump suit without the Q of trumps (5@S in this case.) So a 5@S bid by me over the Q ask denies the Q of spades. If I have the Q of spades, I bid a suit in which I have a K (5@H in this case.) If I have the Q of spades, but no outside Kings I bid 5NT. |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


at|

The reason I said that you should only play Q ask if you play 1430 is because you are more likely to want to know about the Q of trump if responder has one A than zero aces. The 1430 keeps the bidding lower when responder has 1 ace. But, If you don’t play Q ask, there is no point in playing 1430, because you would rather keep the bidding lower with fewer aces (hence 0314.) Thus, in my opinion you should only play 1430 if you play the Q ask. |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |

Dianne0516: How did you know the 4@d bid is a suit and not a first round control? |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


at|

hondo717: that is a good question. normally, I would assume ben's bid showed first round control which should have been 4@C with his hand. Cue bids are up the line. If you bypass a suit, you are denying first round control in that suit. However, since we did not discuss it and in the teaching mode I can see his hand, I knew it meant a secondary suit. If you play cue bidding, 4@D denies first round control in clubs. The other issue is ben has all the key cards, so he might as well bypass cue-bidding and bid 4NT. And if he played Q ask, he could find out about the Q of spades. If I have the Q of trump, he should bid 6, if not bid 5. Let us move to the next board. |

hondo717: Roberta has a 18 or 19 balanced and that is what she bid. Every bid you make should give partner new information. Since she already bid her hand, she has no new information to impart. For her next bid roberta  has a clear pass.|

hondo717: ok, now normally I would lead 4th best, but since dee bid my best suit, will lead my next best suit. It may not be right, but once you start a defense, might as well continue.|

Hondo717: Not much to comment on the bidding.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT| 	
hondo717: ok, let us talk about how to play this hand. ben can count 3 spades, 2 hearts, and 2 clubs for sure. Where can he get the other two? One possibility is an extra heart trick if hearts either break 3-3  or south having QJ. Another possibility is 2 diamond tricks. And yet a third possibility is the club finesse for an extra trick.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT|
hondo717: I think the diamonds offer the best possibility, because on a good day ben can get 3 diamond tricks if roberta has the J. I would have won the spade and played the 9 of diamonds at trick 2. Here ben cannot go wrong because all the option would work for him. Now let us watch how he would play it.|

pg| ***** 109 ***** |


Nt| 
hondo717: Many people do open 3@C with a 6 card suit, since there is no "weak 2" in clubs. And since she is short in hearts, that is not unreasonable. The only problem is that it makes it more difficult for partner to figure out how many clubs she has. For those of you who attended my competitive bidding class, remember I said you should compete based on the number of trump you have. |
pg| ***** 110 ***** |


nt|
So if you have a 10 card fit you can compete to the 4 level. However, it is harder for me to compete when I cannot tell how many clubs she has. So one would question whether the value of preempting is worth lying about the suit length? There is no right answer to that question.|
pg| ***** 111 ***** |


at|
hondo717: now as to the play. Ruffing the 2nd heart was fine. However, at trick four ben should just lead a trump, not the @SK. He pinpointed the spade suit for dee.|
pg| ***** 112 ***** |


nt|
dee_dee_20: I should have ruffed high in hand.|
pg| ***** 113 ***** |


at|
hondo717: not on the 2nd round of hearts, very unlikely ben has singleton.
ben should just lead club right away, not spade then club. and roberta should play the J, she just misclicked she told me. Finally, since ben was nice enough to lead the @SK  for you dee, you might as well finesse him for the Q on the 2nd round of spades. There is no downside to that play. Next Board please.|

I am sure that all of you know how good Roberta is playing bridge. What you did not know is what a great a culinary expert and an able painter she is. BBO does not have capability to show you some of her paintings. However, with pleasure I am reproducing here what she emailed me for this week culinary session. Without further adieux  here she is.|

Hi:  Last May, my grandson's 2nd grade class was asked to bring in a recipe of their favorite food -- all the kids in the class brought in dessert recipes -- not my grandson-- he brought in Gramma Roberta's Brisket of Beef. And here it is.   

1 Flat Cut Brisket (easily available at Costco or Sam's Club); Slices of Garlic; 2 Large Onions Sliced Thinly; Lawry's Salt and Water.|

Preheat the oven to 475 degrees.  Cut 10 small openings on both sides of the brisket.  Insert the garlic slices in the cuts in the brisket.  Sprinkle Lawry salt on both sides of the brisket.  Put in roasting pan (it's good to have the brisket hug the sides of the pan).  Place in oven for 20 minutes.

While brisket is browning, slice the onions.  After 20 minutes, remove the brisket from the pan, add a little water and deglaze the pan (get the drippings off the sides into the water for au jus).  Add onions, and put brisket on other side to brown.|

^d@e@2After 15 minutes, lower oven to 325.  Again deglaze the pot and add a cup of water.  Cover and @E@3cook for 2 more hours.  Be sure to check periodically to make sure there is plenty of liquid.

When the brisket is tender -- remove and pour gravy out.  Again deglaze the pot.  The gravy should be rich (not watery) -- if need be put on stove and reduce.  

Do NOT cut the brisket until it is cold.  Cut off all fat. Then cut into thin slices (AGAINST the grain or it will be stringy).  Get fat off gravy.

Put cut brisket in gravy, and reheat.  

Yum!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It's a really simple recipe -- with very few ingredients and always a huge success.


Roberta
