^d @e@2"nome" believes, “You need repetitions when you start bridge late.” So he trails good @E@3 teachers in the BBO. When possible he attends their lectures, mentoring sessions and tournaments. He squirrels away every note and movie of the hands though he cannot find them when he needs them. As a remedy he decided to incorporate some of those hordes in several presentations such as the one you are about to view. 

In this presentation "nome" combined the movie of the hands from hondo717's mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees.  Those are  condensed from the chat log transcript.  

The goal here is presenting to you hondo717's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of graphics.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. Clicking the first will move you forward and clicking the second will take you back. When available there is an explanation for the bid in the gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. 

Further, all the links in this presentation are clickable - it changes color when you roll your cursor over it.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site.




                           Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

^d @e@2On partner's opening lead, your first obligation is to show attitude.  However, if it is @E@3 obvious  that attitude does not apply  you should give count. For example, pard leads the A, and board has QJxx -- then you give count. Playing standard, you play low from 3 (or 5), high from doubleton and  2nd highest from 4.

Anyway, if attitude makes no sense, you show count. Using our example, pard leads A from AK, and QJxx on board, if you show doubleton, pard will now would judge whether it makes sense to give you a ruff or not.

Next, When playing 3rd hand high, it is imperative that you play the lowest card of a sequence. So if pard leads suit, and you have QJ10, you must play the 10. If you play the Q, pard will assume you don't have the J. Let me expand a little further.  Say there is 10 on dummy, pard leads that suit, and you have QJ9, you should play the 9. Now, a slightly more complicated example. Assume partner leads low, presumably showing an honor.  Dummy has, say Jxx, and you have K10x. Normally, you should play the 10.

^d @e@2When you lead back partner's suit, you should lead back your "remaining count." So, @E@3 let us say partner led a suit and you started with 3. Say board wins first trick, and you get in a little later. You now have two left in partner's suit.  So, assuming you play standard count, you should lead back the higher of your two remaining cards, to show that you have a doubleton remaining. If you started with 4, and have 3 left, you lead back low. This applies to both in suit and in no trump.

Let me be a bit more specific. Say partner overcalled a suit, so you know she has 5. Partner leads the suit and you have 4 and dummy has a doubleton left. If you lead back low, partner knows you started with 4, so both declarer and dummy started with 2. Therefore, leading the suit a third time will give declarer a ruff and sluff. Granted, sometimes leading back remaining count does not matter, but if you get in the habit, partner will trust you when it does matter.

Now, let us play our first Board.

hondo717: ok, before you lead dessie, let me make one other point.  My cardinal rule, lead partner's suit. Secondly, if you did not support, lead count, so low from 3 small and high from doubleton. BTW, if you have supported pard lead high if you have no honor (pard will know you do not have a doubleton, since you supported the suit), low if you have an honor. Normally, you do not lead the honor if you have 3 or 4 to an honor.

hondo717: ok claire, how are you planning on beating this contract.?
hondo717: Normally, 8@S would be right as you did before my undo. However, you can see nine tricks, six diamonds, so high spade should be right this time.  You must take your tricks at once; otherwise, declarer will make his contract. Basically, the point of this hand is, you can see declarer has 9 tricks - 6 diamonds, 2 clubs, and a spade - if you give her the first spade.|

Hondo717: Your switch to hearts was great. Playing a small heart as you did usually is acceptable. However, here by doing so you blocked the suit.  You had a hint. West did not double, so West is unlikely to have four hearts. So you have to hope that North has an honor in hearts and you can make at least 4 heart tricks. Otherwise, you cannot set the contract.|

aspiring: So South should have played A@h first then Q@H to be able to set this contract. Hondo717: Yes, if you don’t have a heart dessie, karen is making it anyway.

hondo717: just like when you are declarer, and you have to develop a plan, as defender, you also have to develop a plan.  At trick one, as defender, develop a plan if possible. Sometimes it is not possible, because you don’t know what pard has. But often it is. Particularly if you pay attention to the bidding.|

magiemae: Now if I would have played the ace of hearts.. what should dessie play?  
hondo717: probably the 6, because she does not want to give up the 9.

pc|D2|pc|DA|pc|D6|pc|D4|nt|
hondo717:  Correct, in this case you want to show attitude, not count. Remember, attitude first, count only if attitude is not appropriate. When West plays the A, you play the 6, if playing standard.

hondo717: Hopefully I can clear  up the confusion?   I only said that if you were showing count. However, the first thing I said was your first obligation is to show attitude on partners opening lead  or on any new suit that is broken by pard. On this trick your first obligation is to show attitude. Play 6@D or 8@D

hondo717: ok, here is the point of this hand.  By bidding  - 1@S/2@H - I am known to have at least 9 cards in the majors. So I have 4 cards in the minors.  If I have a stiff club, then I have 3 diamonds, and you are not going to beat the contract  because I have only one club loser, one diamond loser and one spade loser.  So you have to hope I have 3 clubs and one diamond.  Again, you have to develop a plan on defense. Therefore,  South should continue playing K@C on second trick after North  played the 2 of clubs. Because playing low means having 1 or 3. Then  give a @C ruff to North. The K@S would  be the setting trick.

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|
hondo717: checkback stayman is an alternative to “new minor forcing” played by some people. If you play it, a bid of 2@C over a 1N rebid by opener is “checkback” stayman, asking partner to show, on this hand, either 3 hearts or 4 spades. Alternatively, had responder bid spades, it would be asking opener to show 4 hearts or 3 spades. If responder has both, he should prefer the 4 card suit. If responder has neither, he should bid 2 diamonds.

hondo717: ok, dessie, you were consistent here, you led a club hoping for a ruff with a low card, so you took your K of hearts right away.  Now, what club did claire lead back, and what does it mean?

aspiring: claire led back a 2@C. |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |

hondo717: Great. She led back club for you to ruff.  She could have led back either high or low club.  Now, to clear the confusion we need to review suit preference.|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


pc|D4|pc|DK|pc|D8|pc|D9|nt|
hondo717: when partner leads back something for you to ruff, they lead suit preference.  Low means they want you to lead back the lower of the non-trump suit (in this case diamonds), high means the higher suit (in this case spades.)  Suit preference only applies when leading back something for you to trump.|
