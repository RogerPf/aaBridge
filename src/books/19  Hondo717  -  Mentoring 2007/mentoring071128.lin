^d @e@2"nome" believes, “You need repetitions when you start bridge late.” So he trails good @E@3 teachers in the BBO. When possible he attends their lectures, mentoring sessions and tournaments. He squirrels away every note and movie of the hands though he cannot find them when he needs them. As a remedy he decided to incorporate some of those hordes in several presentations such as the one you are about to view. 

In this presentation "nome" combined the movie of the hands from hondo717's November 25, 27 and 28 mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees.  Those are  condensed from the chat log transcript.  

The goal here is presenting to you hondo717's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. Clicking the first will move you forward and clicking the second will take you back. When available there is an explanation for the bid in the gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. 

Further, all the links in this presentation are clickable - it changes color when you roll your cursor over it.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site. @D@DPlease note that this is a recreation of the mentoring sessions where for teaching purpose unlike the live play you can view all four hands.@D@D




                           Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

nome: I have a concern about opening NT with two small major. I got really burned recently twice in row when I opened NT with such hands. Any comments please. |
PG| ***** 2 ***** |

hondo717: The general tendency is to open 1NT whenever possible, even with a small doubleton. Otherwise it is hard to bid the hand. Occasionally you get burned, but the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages.|

hondo717: Defensive planning is much harder. Basically it is mostly reactive, based on what declarer does. Just start counting tricks and distribution as best you can. For example, you should know how many spades kia has.|

hondo717: Well played kia. 3NT is actually a pretty good contract, but can't be bid on HCP. Although it didn’t help the defense on this hand, it was pretty easy to figure out what distribution kia had by trick 4. Sometimes that info can be very useful, so if you can get in the habit of counting out declarer's distribution, do so. Eventually, it will become automatic if you do it enough.|

PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT|
hondo717: You have 3 choices:
        1@H has the advantage of showing the 5 card major;
        2@C is your longer suit; and
        2NT which shows your distribution (at least 5/5 in clubs and hearts, 2 lowest unbids.)|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


AT|

hondo717: I think 1@H or 2NT are best, 2@C not as good.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


AT|
nome: I like 1@H because we still would be in one level. 2NT would would put us in three level and you are a passed hand.|

hondo717: ok, terry I am going to give you an undo after I review my defensive bidding principles. How many spades do you and deb have between you? |
Pg| ***** 27 ***** |


AT|
Pear: 8 ... but I don’t want you to play hearts at the 3 level. We have the majority of points.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: If you believe my defensive bidding principles, then you should pass. Because, if you are making 3@S you will probably beat us in 3 hearts. But, let us continue. If I had 5 hearts, I would bid 4 hearts, so you can only assume we have at best a 9 card fit, and might even been 8. Your best bid now is pass.|

hondo717: OK, so you beat it terry and you are down in 3 spades. You were not lucky. The law of total tricks works well on many hands.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT|
Pear: Would you explain when to compete and when not to compete please.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Sure be happy to review. For more comprehensive explanation please review the competitive bidding, on my web site ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge^*N. In competitive hands, where both sides have about the same number of points, the number of trumps determines the level to which you should bid. So if you have an 8 card fit, it is ok to contract for 8 tricks, or the 2 level. If you have a 9 card fit, ok to contract for 9 tricks, or the 3 level. That is the basic principle. There are some additions, but do you understand the basic idea?|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT|
Pear: Is there ever a reason to compete at level 3 with 8 card fit based on point count please?|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Good question. If you think you might have game, you still can invite, even with an 8 card fit. Another principle of competitive bidding is you should not let the opponents play at the 2 level. So, kia and I would bid to 3@H over 2 spades even with only an 8 card fit. However, you should not bid to 3@S unless you have a 9 card fit. The other reason to bid to the 3 level with an 8 card fit is if you have a singleton in the opponent’s trump suit. |
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT|
Rarely is letting the opponent’s play at the 2 level a good result. Again, assuming you have a fit, and the points are pretty even. Another way to remember this is the saying "the 3 level belongs to the opponent’s". Don't let them play at the 2 level, but once you force them to the 3 level, let go unless you either have a 9 card fit, or a singleton or void in their trump suit. However, I suggest you review the information with the quiz in my tutorial if you get a chance terry.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT|
nome: Was there anything I could have done to prevent being set? I assume the 3@H was a correct bid.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: 3@H was fine, and, no, the singleton club did you in. Both sides had what is known as the "par result", meaning it is the best either side could do. You are down in 3 spades, so even if kia makes 3@H you are better off. Do not forget, however, you have to learn to defend well in order to follow my principles.|

hondo717: Deb has made a double and correct showing a strong hand, with very good spades. So unless terry has a real bust, he should bid again. A double and correct means pard makes a takeout double and then bids a suit of their own.|

hondo717: This board is a good example why I recommend you open a weak 2 with any 6 card suit, even a weak one, and 5-10 HCP, even with an outside 4 card major and even vulnerable. That is not mainstream thinking, but I find the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. However many experts, (and some students) may disagree.|

Badmonster: Would it help If we played Leb here?|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Yes. Without getting into details, some partnerships play a form of lebensohl over weak 2 bids. But, I really don’t recommend leb for most people, as it is very complicated, and easy to mess up. there are many pards who I won’t play it with. Regardless  this is a tough hand to bid, once I open 2 diamonds and this is why I did it.|

hondo717: I have a good question from one of the kibs regarding roberta's play when you lead A from AK on opening lead. in the old days, you led K from AK and also K from KQ on opening lead and I still prefer that myself. However, the modern convention is to lead A from AK on opening lead. But, in the middle of the hand, if you have a sequence of honors with the A, you play the lowest of the sequence. That way, when it wins the trick, partner knows you have the higher cards. If roberta led the A first, anne would not know she had the K. However, if she leads the K, and it wins, she must have the Ace. The idea is to provide as much info as possible to pard.|

hondo717: anne played it well, ruffing out 2 spades. The problem is she can't prevent elizabeth from getting her 9 of trumps if we defend properly. And as it was said her Q of clubs was a great play. It allowed us to take 2 clubs, ending in my hand, and then I could lead a heart. The heart lead resulted in what is known as a trump promotion. If anne ruffs with the 10, then eliza's 9 is good. And if she ruffs low, as she did, then elizabeth can over ruff. Had we ended up with elizabeth on lead after our 2 club tricks, anne would have been able to score both of dummy’s trumps  because the 10 draws the 9 and then the 6 is good. Trump promotion happens fairly frequently. It occurs if declarer is out of a suit, and defender behind declarer is also out.|

hondo717: Lets talk about the 2@C first. You should open 2@C with a 9 trick hand. anne can count 4-5 diamonds, 2 hearts, 1.5 spades, and .5 clubs, which gives her enough to bid 2@C. Other people use what is known as "losing trick count" to determine whether to open 2@C. I wont get into great detail about losing trick count, but anne only has 3 losers in losing trick count, so OK to open 2@C by that measure as well. Personally, I like the counting winners method myself. I am not a big fan of losing trick count.  One another minor point, there was really no need for anne to bid 5NT. Missing one ace she already knew to play in 6@D  no matter what elizabeth responded.|

In the next panel as in the last week's presentation I have  historical information from an advertisement booklet titled “PORTRIATS OF FREEDOM” inserted in June 12, 2006 The New Yorker magazine. This week you will meet two other patriots. Of course you can click the forward arrow and continue with the bridge not reading the historical information.|

^d@e@2Whether aristocrat, lawyer, farmer, or shopkeeper fifty–six ordinary men achieved something extra- @E@3ordinary when the Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776. The British called the document treasonous and the signatories traitors – singing it was an act punishable by death. Some signers lost their home in the ensuing Revolutionary War. Others were left without their livelihood. All had put their lives on the line.

The Declaration wasn’t just a blueprint for revolution; it helped to secure the future of the United States and became the mission statement for world democracy. We’re all familiar with the famous signers of the Declaration. Here, as a weekly series we will tell you about some of the lesser-known, ordinary heroes who declared our nation’s future. This week we have two more. |cp|8|FP|2|at|

The Reluctant Patriot |CP|8|FP|2|at|
GEORGE READ (1733 – 1798)|CP||FP||AT|
Read, a conservative lawyer, may have opposed such measures as the Stamp Act, but he voted against independence, creating a deadlock with fellow representative Thomas McKean. Caesar Rodney had to cast the decisive vote for Delaware. Ultimately, Read did sign the Declaration once it was adopted.|FP|2|at|

The Midnight Rider |CP|8|FP|2|at|
CAESAR RODNEY (1728 - 1784)|CP||FP||at|
Considered a radical in his home colony, Rodney was no stranger to being an outsider. His face was disfigured by skin cancer, and he often wore a green silk scarf to conceal it. He took an eighty-mile midnight ride to Philadelphia in a thunderstorm to ensure that the bid for independence had Delaware's full support.

hondo717: OK, impossible contract. First of all my weak 2. I know many experts advocate not opening a weak 2 with an outside 4 card major, but most of you know I disagree. My feeling is the plusses of preempting far outweigh the minuses of occasionally missing a major suit fit. This hand is a good demonstration, and we have had several other examples this week.|
PG| ***** 195 ***** |


NT|
hondo717: Now, regarding deb's bidding. Her 2@S bid was good, I like it much better than a double. If you have a 5 card major, usually good to bid it even if you also have the other major with 4 cards.  kia's 2N was fine.  deb does have a problem over 2N. She could pass, 3@H is not terrible, particularly since q of diamonds looks valuable in light of kia's bid. So I would say if you are an optimist bid 3@H, pessimist pass. Unfortunately, pessimists won this hand. On the other hand, you couldn't make 2N either, so the 3@H bid had lots to gain and lost little. in general, optimism is the right course.|

hondo717: Nice defense kia. Contract always is down 1. However, terry, you need to think about the clubs a little bit more. Your best play is the A and low towards dummy. If deb plays low, you have to guess whether to play 10 or Q. But often she will pop with the K. The way you played it, you just about always lose 2 club tricks, the way I suggested you will only lose one club trick most of the times.|

A trump lead is good when declarer has bid 2 suits, and responder has supported the 2nd suit, and you are long in the first suit. My other lead could be a diamond, hoping to set up a trick before deb pitches losing diamonds, but on balance I think a trump is better.|
