^d @e@2"nome" believes, “You need repetitions when you start bridge late.” So he trails good @E@3 teachers in the BBO. When possible he attends their lectures, mentoring sessions and tournaments. He squirrels away every note and movie of the hands though he cannot find them when he needs them. As a remedy he decided to incorporate some of those hordes in a presentation such as the one you are about to view. 

In this presentation "nome" combined the movie of the hands from hondo717's mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees.  Those are  condensed from the chat log transcript.  

The goal here is presenting to you hondo717's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of graphics.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. Clicking the first will move you forward and clicking the second will take you back. When available there is an explanation for the bid in the gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. 

Further, all the links in this presentation are clickable - it changes color when you roll your cursor over it.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site.




                           Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

mb|p|mb|p|nt|
Terry chose not to open his hand.   I think that is a mistake. He has 12 HCP and two 4-card majors. You may miss game if you don’t open that hand. I  think just follow the rule of 20. Occasionally if you have 11 HCP and weak long suits, particularly minors, you can make a case for passing, but should open 12 HCP  hands. The only time not to open a hand with 12HCP is if it is 4-3-3-3, as that does not meet the rule of 20.|

The 1@D  and 1@H were  good bids. And so was 2@D. However, because terry did not open the bidding he now has a problem.  3@D is kind of weaker than what  he has, tending to show 10-11, and anne may pass when you have game.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


mb|4D|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|
Fortunately, anne  has 15, so she didn’t pass and they ended in 5@D. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|

However, anne should think about 3NT.  I know that is difficult with a void, but terry bid the suit, so she knows there are some stoppers.  Typically, it is easier to make 3NT than 5 of a minor.  In this case either makes, so we ended up ok.|sb|s|

hondo717: why did you lead the 8@S sarah?  J@S is definitely wrong. Problem with 8 is it is not top of nothing, but I might think it is. For now  we accept your lead.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt|
Unless you play 2nd high from 3 small, the 8 is confusing.  So if you decide to lead spades, I think the 4 is best  It shows both count and an honor. granted the J is kind of a crummy honor, but it is an honor.  And on this auction, a spade lead seems reasonable, since they avoided NT.  A club would have been ok, as would a trump.  You lead a trump if you think you want to cut down on dummy ruffs.  In this case terry bid hearts, then raised diamonds, so it is likely he is short in one black suit.  As it turns out, it is clubs, but he has honors.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt|
You  lead a trump if you want to cut down on ruffs, and don’t think you need to establish a side suit first.  However, an unbid suit is usually a good lead as well.|

pg| ***** 24 ***** |


mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|3S|nt|
hondo717: ok, sarah, what do you think 3@S shows?  You may remember our discussion about the use of a cue bid to show a limit raise or better. You do have a limit raise.  However, you may recall, I suggested using a cue bid to show a limit raise, so you can bid 3@S with less than a limit raise as preemptive.  Please show a limit raise by bidding 3@H. I will do the undo.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


ub||mb|3H|mb|d|nt|
hondo717: terry's double should say he would have bid 3@H, had sarah bid 2S or passed.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


mb|3S|nt|
hondo717: Do you feel you have more than a limit raise sarah?  If you do, then 4@S is a good bid.  However, my 3@S showed a minimum hand but  I like it if you bid 4@S  because you have a very powerful hand.|

hondo717: that is a very good play, because now I will go down, as I have no entries to dummy.
hondo717: anne defended this well, by making me use my trumps in dummy, she set up 2 trumps for herself.|

mc|9|Nt| 
hondo717: The contract was a good one, it will make anytime trumps are 3-1. Less experienced players are often reluctant to make declarer ruff.  But, it is often a good line of defense, as on this hand.  It is usually a neutral defense at worst. So don’t be afraid to force declarer to ruff, if you have nothing else better, or you are trying to set up trumps in your hand.|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt| 
hondo717: Sometimes by forcing declarer to ruff, you make him lose control of the hand, you run him out of trumps and can cash side suits.  For example, in this case, I had club losers to worry about, so I needed to retain some trumps in dummy. Shall we start the next hand?|

pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|
hondo717: ok, let us look at those who voted for 2NT. If you are only planning to stop in 3@H that would be ok.  But, if you remember my class in competitive bidding, I said it is ok to bid to the 4 level with a 10 card fit.  Since I have 4 hearts and I know sarah has 6, I know we have a 10 card fit. so 4@H is a better bid in my opinion.  This is really the same reason that you bid 4 of a major over one of a major when you have 5 card support.  If you have a 10 card fit, you should bid to the 4 level.|

hondo717: ok, now if we look at all 4 hands, we can see that terry and anne can make 4 spades. They lose 1 heart, 1 diamond, and 1 club.  But I made it very difficult for them to bid 4@S, or even double me.  That is why you should preempt whenever you have the appropriate hand.|Nt|
Pear: was my dbl correct pls? |
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


at|
hondo717: terry's double was fine. I like to have 4 of the unbid major when I do it, but the preempt makes it tough, so double was ok.  The other choice was 3@D, but the most likely game is 4@S so I like the double. 

Let us move on to the next hand.|

hondo717: sarah's bid of 2@S was very good. It generally should show 4, but if you have good 3 card support and a singleton or void, it is ok to raise on 3.  Responder should be aware that on occasion, it is ok for opener to raise his major with 3 card support. And sarah had the perfect hand to raise on 3 card support, made it easy for us to get to the right game. sarah could bid 2@D, but if I pass, or even bid 3@D, then it makes it harder to raise spades later. Thus, sometimes it is best to raise right away with 3 cards, as in this case.|

hondo717: ok, let me plan the hand out.  It looks like I have 5 spade tricks, 3 diamond tricks with that lead, and one heart for sure. That is 9 tricks. Then, I can ruff one club for a tenth trick.  So I have to make sure I play a club before drawing all the trumps.  I am a little worried about a diamond ruff, but hopefully if terry leads it, I can pitch a loser on the diamond later.|

hondo717: Great terry, good discard. You definitely need to keep parity in diamond with dummy. Otherwise dummy's last diamond would be good.  When defending, you try and keep the same length as dummy in the side suits. In this case, you see the K and J of diamonds, so you must retain the last diamond to prevent my 4 from being good.|

hondo717: ok, we obviously missed a game.  South took a slight underbid due to a problem hand.  With 4 clubs, North could make a case biding 3@S, so Soth can bid 3NT with a heart stopper. On the other hand, South has an 8-9 trick hand, so could have opened 2@C. Or South could have bid 4@C over 1@D.  Distributional hands are hard to bid.  I don’t like to open 2@C with this few hcp.  That is more a style thing. The reason is it takes up a lot of bidding room.|

hondo717: 1@H and 2@H were fine.  Now, the question is, how best to invite.
3@H is ok, however, a slightly better bid might be 3@C, which is known as a  HSGT - "help suit game try."|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


at|
A HSGT here tells partner that you want to invite to game, and partner should evaluate club cards as good assets. In this case  if lisa's diamonds and clubs were switched, she should bid 4@H.  However, in the current hand as it is, 3@C does not make lisa's hand any better, so she would just bid 3@H anyway. What West needs is club honors, not shortness. A singleton club is a detriment, not a help.|
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


Nt|
pfatseas: I thought HSGT was to ask p if she can cover your losers in a weak suit, so why clubs instead of @d. |
pg| ***** 94 ***** |


nt| 
hondo717: No, help suit game tries show some honors, because most of the time honors are shared between the 2 hands.  For example, imagine lisa's clubs and diamonds are switched, then 4@H  is a very good contract. On the other hand  lisa's diamonds do nothing to get rid of east;s diamond losers. In essence,  a help suit game try is looking for either a maximum 2@H bid, or honors in clubs. Further, you could also make a case that you should just bid 4@H though that is definitely a bit aggressive.  I would explain the topic further in the next panel after we finished playing this hand. |

hondo717: Help suit game tries occur when you would like to try for game, based on specific cards in partner's hand rather than just how many points he has. Often you can make game with fewer than 25 HCP between the two hands if the hands "fit" together well. "Fitting" together well often means that both hands have points in the same suits. |

For example, if you have Q9x opposite K10x, that is much better than Q9x opposite xxx. In the first case, the Q is actually worth something, whereas in the second case, the holding is almost equivalent to xxx.|

The idea behind a help suit game try (HSGT) is to discover such a fit. It usually occurs when partner has raised your suit. If he has close to the upper end of the range, or a good fit, you would like to be in game.  |

hondo717: As a common example, assume the bidding has gone 1@H by you, 2@H by partner, and you have around 16 or 17 points. If partner has 8 or 9 (the top of the range for 2@H), you certainly would like to be in game. So, one thing you could do is simply bid 3@H, asking partner to bid 4@H with 8 or 9. |
pg| ***** 117 ***** |

However, another thing you could do is bid another suit where you have some broken high cards (such as the aforementioned K10x). This is a help suit game try. It tells partner to bid 4 if he has a good 8 or 9, or, if he has some "help" (high cards) in the suit mentioned, even if he has a bit less in the way of points.|

at|
Partner also has some flexibility. If he is not sure whether to bid 3 or 4, he can bid another suit, which is also a help suit game try, and you can then decide based on this new information whether to bid 3 or 4 (or possibly 3NT). |

Kib: what if the partner has none of those?|
pg| ***** 120 ***** |


at|
hondo717: If partner does not want to accept the help suit game try, he simply rebids the agreed upon suit (in the example, he would bid 3@H.)

Let’s resume our game with the next hand.|

hondo717: ok, let's talk a little about what is known as "the dangerous defender." Looking at the hand, lisa can count 1 spade, 2 hearts, 1 diamond, and 3 clubs for sure. However, if the club finesse loses, the east will lead a spade back, and lisa will lose 3 or 4 spades. On the other hand,  there really is no alternative to the club finesse because of lack of entries to the board.  lisa could try for 3 diamonds instead of 3 clubs, hoping the diamond honors are split. The reason lisa might try the diamond suit is to avoid the dangerous opponent, in this case East, from being on lead.|hondo717: If West is on lead, defenders cannot attack spades without giving up another trick. However, if East is on lead, then defenders can lead through lisa's jack of spades. That makes East the "dangerous" opponent.  In general, when playing NT, you try to keep the dangerous opponent off lead if you can. OK lisa now you can play.|

hondo717: I am short of diamonds, so there is some chance that partner has a diamond stack.  If partner doubled, that would be a takeout double, so partner might very well be stuck. Because I am short in diamonds, I should double, and not be surprised if partner passes.  My double could backfire, but if I don’t do it, the opponents might be stealing the hand from us cheaply.|sb|w|sb|n|

hondo717: the point of this hand is that if you are in the pass out seat over a preempt and you are short of trumps, it is quite possible partner has a trump stack behind the pre-emptor.  That is why if you are short of trump, you strain to double, to protect in case partner has a penalty hand. 
Next hand please.|

cc1313: Would you explain "western cue"? |
pg| ***** 165 ***** |


at|
hondo717: a "western cue" is a cue bid in the opponent’s suit, usually at the 3 level, when no suit has been agreed upon. It asks partner to bid 3NT with a stopper in the suit. If you had a stopper you could bid NT yourself. So the cue bid is "asking" and not "telling", since you could "tell" pard by bidding NT. |

^d@e@26 (8 ounce) veal shanks, trimmed
Salt and pepper to taste	
¼ cup of flour
1 tbs. butter divided
1 clove garlic (minced)
1 cup finely chopped yellow onion (1 medium)
½ cup finely chopped carrot 
½ cup finely chopped celery
2 bacon slices (I omitted these – I don’t eat pork)
1 cup dry white wine
1 cup fat-free, reduced sodium beef broth
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes (drained)
1 cup chopped parsley
1 teaspoon grated lemon rind

Sprinkle veal with salt and pepper and dredge in flour. Melt 1 ½ tsps. butter in large dutch oven over @E@3 medium-high heat. Add 3 veal shanks and cook for 8 minutes – browning on all sides. Remove to a plate and repeat procedure for the other 3 shanks.Remove to a plate.

Add all vegetables (and bacon) to the pan; sauté for 5 minutes. Add wine and cook another 5 minutes, reducing the liquid. Add broth and tomatoes. Return the veal to the pan and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat and simmer for 2 hours (or until the veal is tender). Check on it to make sure it isn’t losing it’s liquid – if so lower the heat. Combine parsley and lemon rind and add to osso bucco.  Cook another 10 minutes.

NOTES:  I always make things like this a day ahead of time so that the flavors can sink in.  

Enjoy.  Roberta  - BBO name robzim|
