^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Faye, Mary has shown 20-21 HCP. You have a flat 11 HCP. Ordinarily you need a tad more than 33 points for a slam. Surely it could make 6 especially since your points are very nice.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, you do not have the 33 points to make 6 and you don't have a long suit to run. So I would bid 3N. But lets see how 6 does.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very nicely defended Judy. So 6N is a very hard contract to make. 6 of a suit is usually easier sometimes even with a 7 card fit. |
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You really should not bid 6N unless you are pretty sure you have 33 points. You can add length points to get there. If you have a 5 card suit that counts extra. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, if Faye had 12 and a 5-card suit, 6N would be a reasonable call. Or even with 11 HCP since Mary could have 21. But with 11 flat, although 6N can make sometimes, it is usually not a favorite to make.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|^B@2
msphola:  Could Faye have bid 4NT?|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Faye could have bid 4N quantitative, although I think she is a point short, but that would have been reasonable.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss the opening lead against 6 level contracts. Against 6N you usually try to make a "passive" lead, meaning a lead that does not give anything away. Most experts would have led the @CJ.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Against 6 of a suit, you are trying to set up a quick winner for yourself. You often lead away from ace, king or queen in a suit the opponents have not bid. But against 6N passive is usually best.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT|^B@2
msphola:  I was told that you do not lead from a suit where you have a tenace.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is often true Mary and is risky. But against 3N I often lead away from a tenace if it is my best suit and it often works well. I can't count the number of times I have led away from a KJ, my partner has the Ace and we take the first 4 or 5 tricks.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Leading away from a tenace is the opposite -- very aggressive and should be avoided.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, so remember that when it starts out 1 of a minor, 1 of a major, and opener has 20 points with 4 card support there are 2 ways to show that hand. |
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One is to jump to 4 with no singletons or voids. The other is to splinter, as I did here. And if responder has 12+ they should look for slam.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well both Judy and I stretched so 4@S was not a good contract. 4@S was a reasonable call by Judy but there were 2 reasons to be cautious and perhaps pass 3@S. They are both related to the trump suit. |
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, you should be aggressive with a 9-card fit and conservative with an 8-card fit. So had I made a 4-card limit raise, I think Judy has a clear 4 spade bid. But with a 3-card limit raise, since Judy knows we only have 8 spades, she can be more cautious. |
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other reason is her trumps are very weak. So there is a good chance we have 2 trump losers especially with an 8-card fit. Having said all that, it is hard to make even 3@S so it was my aggressive 3@S bid that was the reason we got a bad result. In hindsight, 2@S was the place to be.|

BT||qx|BAE|HT|B|fp|3|cs|1|cp|4|at|^-{    That’s So Bae: Beyond the Noun Uses of Bae    }
^-|HT|D|cs||cp||fp||AT|^b@2January 8, 2015 by: Jane Solomon |CP|1|AT|^*Hblog.dictionary.com/adjectival-bae/^*N|CP||ht|f|AT|Over the last couple of years, the term^*b bae ^*Nhas achieved widespread usage. While the noun form has been around for over 10 years, adjectival and verbal uses, along with other related forms, have more recently started popping up to describe the people and things we love, or at least like-like. Twitter, in particular, is rife with interesting new uses of the term. The popular social media platform has been used to mine language change for years and has inspired some recent linguistic scholarly research.|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |

Dictionary.com defines the noun^*b bae ^*Nas: "Slang. an affectionate term used to address or refer to one’s girlfriend, boyfriend, etc." Many have debated the etymology of bae, some insisting that it derives from the acronym "Before Anyone Else." The earliest evidence of this connection on Twitter is from a July 19, 2011, tweet, making "Before Anyone Else" a backronym of bae, which first surfaced in rap music and on Urban Dictionary in the early-to-mid-2000s. A much more likely etymological explanation is that^*b bae ^*Nis a shortening of baby or babe.|

When ^*bbae^*N appears as a noun, its meaning is relatively set: it’s a term of endearment. However possibilities abound as ^*b bae ^*Nmoves into to other parts of speech. These days^*b bae ^*Nhas gotten a lot of mileage out of its robust use as an adjective. My guess is that adjectival^*b bae ^*N(or what I’ll call adjectival ^*bbae^*N for now) at first pointed to the original boyfriend/girlfriend/significant other sense, as in the following examples:|

NT|^B@2

But adjectival^*b bae ^*Ngoes beyond literal significant others, and into the realm of fantasy significant others. If you were to call a celebrity bae, there’s an implicit understanding that this is make-believe; you don’t actually know this person (David Beckham) and you probably wouldn’t date him if you did (unless you are a former Spice Girl). Additionally^*b bae ^*Ncan be used to describe people who are cool or hot or stylish or wonderful, whether or not you have any romantic interest in them.|

Things can also be bae. In fact, this is so common, it has sparked internet outrage. Sometimes the actual part of speech of emerging slang can be hard to identify. Just look at the debates among linguists surrounding the part of speech of because x. While in the above examples,^*b bae ^*Nresembles an adjective, is^*b bae ^*Nreally an adjective? Let’s take a closer look at "pizza is bae." The following constructions commonly appear:

Pizza is bae.
Pizza is so bae.
Pizza is my bae. 
Pizza is the bae. |
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


NT|^B@2

All of these examples express the same sentiment: "I love pizza." The second example is clearly an adjective, but part of speech is more murky for the first example. Could there be an omitted-yet-understood possessive pronoun or definite article implied here, as fully spelled out in examples three and four? Is "Pizza is bae," a shortening of either "Pizza is my bae" or "Pizza is the bae"? Could^*b bae ^*Nbe part of an implied noun phrase? Returning to Ashley Ford’s tweet "Oh, he wants Meg Ryan to be^*b bae ^*Nso he don’t want to tell her he’s Rich Bookstore Man?" we see that Ford capitalizes bae, giving it proper noun treatment. Is this because^*b bae ^*Nis part of the implied noun phrase "his bae?" Or does^*b bae ^*Nstand on its own as an adjective here?|

Bae has shown itself to be a very productive new element of English. Not only does it straddle parts of speech, related forms of^*b bae ^*Nhave emerged as well. You can be baeless or baeful, and you can achieve baeness and baedom. You can be super-, uber-, or extra-bae.|

Bae is used as a verb meaning "to make someone your significant other," as in "to^*b bae ^*Nor nah to bae." While William Shakespeare gets credit for popularizing countless terms in English, it’s safe to say he did not coin the verb use of bae.|
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


NT|^B@2

Bae is sometimes also used as a superlative, as seen above in the pizza examples. People or things can be "the baest" or "the bae."

"Jennifer Anniston is probably the baest bae of all the baes ever to bae in the history of baedom."|
PG| ***** 155 ***** |

While some English speakers wish to banish the word bae, the Twitterverse and beyond has found^*b bae ^*Nto be an extremely adaptable and productive term, far more flexible than baby or babe. Now that^*b bae ^*Nhas achieved high levels of pop-culture saturation, perhaps it will lose its edge (maybe it’s already lost its edge). Or maybe it will further establish itself as a go-to term of endearment and become a fixture of English.|

Albert Michelson the first American who was awarded a Nobel Prize in physics
qx|MICH|cs|6|fp|2|ht|b|at|^-{ Albert Michelson the first American who was awarded a Nobel Prize in physics }
^-|fp||ht|d|at|^B@2From "A Short History of Nearly Everything" Copyright © 2003 by Bill Bryson |
PG| ***** 159 ***** |

We shall turn to these ourselves in a moment, but first we must make a slight (but relevant!) detour to Cleveland, Ohio, and an institution then known as the Case School of Applied Science. There, in the 1880s, a physicist of early middle years named Albert Michelson, assisted by his friend the chemist Edward Morley, embarked on a series of experiments that produced curious and disturbing results that would have great ramifications for much of what followed.|
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


AT| 

What Michelson and Morley did, without actually intending to, was undermine a longstanding belief in something called the luminiferous ether, a stable, invisible, weightless, frictionless, and unfortunately wholly imaginary medium that was thought to permeate the universe. Conceived by Descartes, embraced by Newton, and venerated by nearly everyone ever since, the ether held a position of absolute centrality in nineteenth-century physics as a way of explaining how light traveled across the emptiness of space. It was especially needed in the 1800s because light and electromagnetism were now seen as waves, which is to say types of vibrations. Vibrations must occur in something; hence the need for, and lasting devotion to, an ether. As late as 1909, the great British physicist J. J. Thomson was insisting: "The ether is not a fantastic creation of the speculative philosopher; it is as essential to us as the air we breathe"—this more than four years after it was pretty incontestably established that it didn’t exist. People, in short, were really attached to the ether. |

If you needed to illustrate the idea of nineteenth-century America as a land of opportunity, you could hardly improve on the life of ^*BAlbert Michelson. Born in 1852 on the German– Polish border to a family of poor Jewish merchants, he came to the United States with his family as an infant and grew up in a mining camp in California's gold rush country, where his father ran a dry goods business.^*N Too poor to pay for college, he traveled to Washington, D.C., and took to loitering by the front door of the White House so that he could fall in beside President Ulysses S. Grant when the President emerged for his daily constitutional. (^*BIt was clearly a more innocent age.^*N) In the course of these walks, Michelson so ingratiated himself to the President that Grant agreed to secure for him a free place at the U.S. Naval Academy. It was there that Michelson learned his physics. |
PG| ***** 162 ***** |


NT|^B@2

Ten years later, by now a professor at the Case School in Cleveland, Michelson became interested in trying to measure something called the ether drift—a kind of head wind produced by moving objects as they plowed through space. One of the predictions of Newtonian physics was that the speed of light as it pushed through the ether should vary with respect to an observer depending on whether the observer was moving toward the source of light or away from it, but no one had figured out a way to measure this. It occurred to Michelson that for half the year the Earth is traveling toward the Sun and for half the year it is moving away from it, and he reasoned that if you took careful enough measurements at opposite seasons and compared light’s travel time between the two, you would have your answer. |
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


AT|

Michelson talked Alexander Graham Bell, newly enriched inventor of the telephone, into providing the funds to build an ingenious and sensitive instrument of Michelson’s own devising called an interferometer, which could measure the velocity of light with great precision. Then, assisted by the genial but shadowy Morley, Michelson embarked on years of fastidious measurements. The work was delicate and exhausting, and had to be suspended for a time to permit Michelson a brief but comprehensive nervous breakdown, but by 1887 they had their results. They were not at all what the two scientists had expected to find. |
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


AT|

As Caltech astrophysicist Kip S. Thorne has written: "The speed of light turned out to be the same in all directions and at all seasons." It was the first hint in two hundred years—in exactly two hundred years, in fact—that Newton’s laws might not apply all the time everywhere. The Michelson-Morley outcome became, in the words of William H. Cropper, "probably the most famous negative result in the history of physics." ^*BMichelson was awarded a Nobel Prize in physics for the work—the first American so honored—but not for twenty years.^*N Meanwhile, the Michelson-Morley experiments would hover unpleasantly, like a musty smell, in the background of scientific thought.|
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


AT| 

Remarkably, and despite his findings, when the twentieth century dawned Michelson counted himself among those who believed that the work of science was nearly at an end, with "only a few turrets and pinnacles to be added, a few roof bosses to be carved," in the words of a writer in Nature.|

In fact, of course, the world was about to enter a century of science where many people wouldn’t understand anything and none would understand everything.|
