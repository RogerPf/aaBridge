She has attended all of Howard's mentoring sessions. Along with Ava and Howard she plays with other experts late at night at the Main Bridge Club. She learned bridge so quickly that the K9CBL (K9 Contract Bridge League) has recognized her as a Silicon Life Master.

After receiving that high honor Movie Maker has asked her to act as a bridge "Dear Abby" fielding questions and problems from BBO students. Please feel free to send your bridge questions either to MM or to Howard. This week's question is from ^*BBilbo ^*N, BBO nickname ^*BBaggins^*N.

|HT|p|va|4|at|^B@2
^*BDear Misty^*N: We have bridge tournaments in the Hill sanctioned by HCBL (Hobbit Contract Bridge League). I heard that we are playing the same system (Standard Hobbit) as the the K9s and the Big People. We were wondering whether you can arrange a trip to the HILL using a spaceship and give a bridge seminar. I am sure it would be a big hit.

^*BDear Bilbo^*N: I would love to do something fun like you suggested. However, I cannot leave Howard and Ava alone. They would be lost without me even for one week. However, I heard that Microsoft has launched its Hologram with updated Hololens in your area. Check it out. You probably can kib Howard's mentoring session which is great and I learned all I know by kibbing those sessions. Click the link below and get the scoop on Hololens:|CP|1|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This was not an easy hand to play. She has 1@C, 1@D, and 2 spade for sure. So she needs 3 more tricks. She can set up 1 heart trick for sure. She can hope the @SQ is onside. But that only gets her to 6.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, the problem is, if she loses the lead in any suit but hearts, she will lose 4 clubs, 2 hearts, and whatever trick she loses the lead in.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|^B@2
so playing a heart was reasonable. That gets her to at least 5 with the spade as another possibility. Plus if hearts are 3-3 she might make the hand. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On this hand because of the bad heart break she still goes down 2 and there was really nothing to be done.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT|^B@2
now let's talk about if Mary should bid or not. I think pass is ok but 2@H is also possible. It is possible that South has 4 weak hearts (often does) and that 2@H has plays.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I would also pass but the point I am trying to make is that a 2@H bid by Mary over 1NT is natural, not Michaels. If Mary had a Michaels hand she would have bid 2@H right away over 1H bid.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A natural bid in a suit that the opponents have bid first does not come up often, especially if your suit is a major (hearts in this case). But say Mary had 6 diamonds. Then it is very possible that their side could bid diamonds.

For example, if (on a different hand) the auction goes 1@D-P-1@S-P-1N-2@D by Faye (not on this hand). 2@D is natural, and that auction does occur from time to time.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I will discuss 3@H in a minute, but first let's look at Faye's hand assuming 3@H is invitational. Let's count Faye's dummy points. She has 7 HCP, 1 length point, and 1 point for the doubleton spade. That's 9 dummy points. Her 2@H  bid shows 6-9 (or possibly a bad 10). If 3@H is an invite, she has the top of her range so Faye has a clear 4@H bid.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT|
^B@2Her hand cannot be much better than it is given the 2@H raise. Remember, once you have defined your hand and partner invites, you must answer in the context of what you have said about your hand. And Faye already told Mary she has 6-9. Mary, knowing that, invited anyway, so Faye has a clear accept since she has the max ## of points she said she had.|mb|4H|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


sk|w|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's talk about Mary's bid.|UB|2|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


AT| First of all, some pairs play what is known as "1-2-3-stop." So they play that 3@H by Mary is simply preemptive. The idea about 1-2-3-stop is, most of the time, if Mary passes, Judy will balance. |
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As I have said many times, letting the opponents play in an 8-card fit at the 2-level is not winning bridge in general. So if Mary passed, it is likely an expert North would make some bid and not let them play in 2@H. And, based on LOTT, Mary would compete to 3@H anyway.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Generally, the idea behind 1-2-3-stop is to prevent the opponents from exchanging information. I am not suggesting you play 1-2-3-stop, just explaining why you might consider it. If playing 1-2-3-stop, what would Mary bid to invite? She would have to bid some new suit or 2N.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But lets assume Mary meant 3@H as a general invite. Let's count her declarer points and see if she has an invite. She has 13 HCP, has 2 length point, for a total of 15 Starting Points. |
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Once there is a heart fit, she can add 1 for the 2 doubletons, and 1 for the 6th heart. That gives her 17. That means Faye needs 9 dummy points to get to the 26 combined points that their side needs. It is barely possible that Faye has 9 points but not likely.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Surprisingly enough, Mary made a more aggressive bid than I would have made. They happen to make game but should they be in game? |
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


AT|Just because you make a contract does not mean it is a good contract. |
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT|^B@2
And just because you go down does not mean you are in a bad contract. If you showed me the East/West hands, and asked me if I want to be in game, the answer is definitely not.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Mary had 3 very fortunate things happen. a) the @DA was onside b) the @CK was onside, and c) hearts were 2-2. If any of those things don't happen, she goes down. In fact, I would say given all the possible distributions of the North/South cards, it is more likely 3@H is going down than 4@H is making.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I would guess the odds of 4@H making is under 15%. Although you want to bid aggressively to game in IMPs, a 15% game is not winning bridge in general. Vulnerable, it is ok in IMPs to be in a 40% game (e.g. one that for example needs a 2-2 break). Non-vul the odds should be close to 50%. But a 15% game is not a game you wish to be in.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But Mary's aggressive bidding paid off, so perhaps the teacher should reconsider :) especially since I give Mary a hard time for not being aggressive enough.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North should be consistent. She either have to bid 2@S right away (6-9 and 3 card raise) or you have to treat it as a 3 card limit raise and bid 3@S over 2@S. |
PG| ***** 60 ***** |

If she wants to treat it as an initial 2@S bid, I have no problem with that. But once you bid 1N you have to be consistent and your second bid should be 3@S.|mb|3S|

PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I have 10 HCP + 2 length points + 1 quality suit point = 13. Then once we find a fit, I can add 1 for the 6th spade with our fit plus 2 for the singleton for a total of 16 Declarer Points which is enough to bid game.|mb|4S|

PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If Faye bid 4@C over 3@S, I would be happy to bid 4@S in terms of I think, if they let us play it there, we would get a good result. But tactically I would pass, because I don"t think we are beating 5@C (although it turns out we are). They make 3@C losing 1@S, 2 hearts and 1 diamond.|

PG| ***** 120 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Remember the reason new suits are forcing is that responder could have a big hand. But if you play the only way to show a big hand over a double is redouble or 2N, there is no reason to play new suits as forcing.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Having said that, that is not what most people play over takeout doubles. They play something that I think is a lot more confusing. They play new suits at the 1 level are forcing, but new suits at the 2-level are weak.|

NT|^B@2
For example, 1@H-dbl-1@S is forcing. It need not be 10 points but it could be. But 1@H-dbl-2@C is always less than 10 points. |
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I think that is very confusing which is why I don't like it. It is counter intuitive and hard to remember. So by my system Judy must redouble. However, we will let her play the more standard method that 1@H was forcing.|

^*BStrong^*N: Last year, we asked our readers what words best describe their mothers. We noticed a prominent theme in the What word best describes your mother?s, which spoke of moms most "tenacious," "resilient," "indestructible," and "unyielding" in character. One submission effectively encapsulates this theme: strong. This versatile adjective entered English over a thousand years ago as a descriptor of physical power and muscular force. Shortly thereafter, it took on a meaning of great moral power or courage. Since then, senses and applications for this What word best describes your mother? have multiplied, giving us variations such as "powerful in influence or authority" and "able to resist strain, force, wear, etc." ^*BSound like anyone you know?^*N|

The word beautiful entered English with a sense of "embodying physical perfection," true to its Latin root bellus meaning "pretty." But shortly after its entry into the lexicon, beautiful began to mean "excellent" and "admirable," denoting qualities that are far more than skin deep. We broadly define the term as "possessing qualities that give great pleasure or satisfaction to see, hear, think about; delighting the senses or mind." Perhaps because so many wonderful qualities are associated with this versatile term, many of our readers found beautiful to be the perfect maternal descriptor.|

The earliest sense of intelligent was "a listener." That noun sense has all but disappeared, but its essence survives in modern senses of intelligent that emphasize the possession of keen understanding and comprehension, faculties that often flow from effective listening. Several of our readers selected this term to describe their moms; other terms in this word family that might be fun to send Mom's way are sagacious ("having or showing acute mental discernment and practical sense"), perspicacious ("having keen mental perception") and of course wise, which lends a moral component to understanding and comprehension to mean "having the power of discerning and judging properly as to what is true or right."|

Gentle is often used to mean "kindly and amiable." But a look at its history and evolution reveals an enchanting surprise. Gentle is derived from the Latin gentilis meaning "belonging to the same family." This element of familial distinction is reflected in the earliest senses of gentle, "of good birth or family" and "noble." By the early 1800s, gentle took a turn and acquired the meaning of "enchanted or haunted by fairies," according to the Oxford English Dictionary. ^*BThis supernatural sense of the word might also come in handy to describe mothers as so many of them do seem to possess magical powers.^*N|

Some of our readers submitted words that connote poise and elegance. One such word was classy. This word is defined as "of a high class, rank, or grade; stylish; admirably smart." It descends from the Latin classis, which referred to a division of Roman people on the basis of land, a group of citizens called to serve in the military, or other designated bands. Other words that might come in handy if your mom is the model of sophistication: smart in the sense "socially elegant; sophisticated or fashionable," exquisite in the sense "of particular refinement or elegance," and, if she displays a decidedly metropolitan panache, urbane, "reflecting elegance, sophistication, especially in expression."|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|I feel the most important concept on this hand is that you should always get in the habit of counting out partner's points on defense.

PG| ***** 182 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|If the number of points declarer has is a range (for example if declarer opened 1NT they have 15-17) then, to make it easy, just use the middle of the range (e.g. assume 16 points if declarer opened 1NT). |
PG| ***** 183 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|You add your estimate to your previous total. You then subtract your final total from 40 (the total number of HCP in the deck) and that tells you approximately how many points partner has.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|For example, suppose declarer opened 1NT. Say you have 10 HCP and dummy comes down with 7 HCP. The total between dummy and you is 17. If you assume declarer has 16 points, 17 + 16 = 33. That means partner has approximately 40 -33 = 7 HCP (6-8 to be more precise).|

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|After South (RHO) doubles our 1@C in the balancing (or protective) seat, we should not Pass. What if the double gets passed out - you would feel a bit sick!

PG| ***** 192 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Partner has rubbish given the pass of our 1@C opening, so it is always a good idea to find your fit before you get too high. You might then wonder, wouldn't a 1@H bid show a more distributional hand with something like four hearts and five or more clubs? |
PG| ***** 193 ***** |

Well, no. Partner has passed our 1@C so if we had length in clubs, we shouldn't be muddling around with a 1@H bid. So, after our 1@H bid our LHO bids 1@S and partner should now compete to 2@H. |
