^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We should make 4@H regardless. Even if Anna ducks the club, as she should, the 3rd club sets up and Ann just pitches her spade loser. But Ann can make 5 once the clubs set up.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|She still throws her spade on the good club 9 and ends up taking 4 hearts plus a ruff, 3 diamonds, 2 clubs, and 2 spades for 11 tricks. But the key to this hand was "2nd hand low."|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I know it is hard, but it is right almost all the time. So if you just do it automatically you will come out way ahead in the long run. The only exception is if you can win the setting trick. Then 2nd hand high is ok.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One other point. Since Anna decided she was bidding 3@C if we bid, then she might as well bid 3@C right away to make it hard for us. |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|By doubling rather than bidding 3@C, she allowed us to find our heart fit. Having said that, Barb probably leads the @CQ on opening lead, which allows us to make 3NT easily taking 4 hearts, 2 club, 2 spade, and 2 diamonds at least. Plus probably an extra diamond.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had I looked better at my hand, instead of 1@S I should have bid 2@D. It is Michaels to show my 5-5 hand. We still end up in spades and Ann gets to play it. But not sure if we get to 4.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to whether Ann should bid 4@S or 3@S, I am not sure. The law of total tricks bid is 3@S and Ann's diamond points are suspect on offense. So I probably would bid only 3@S. But fortunately for me, Ann chose to bid 4@S which is a good contract.|

pg| ***** 50 ***** |


mb|p|mb|2H|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most people play new minor forcing. And if you play New Minor Forcing then 2@H shows a ^*Bweak^*N hand with 5 spades and 4 (occasionally 5) hearts. Then the 1N bidder must either pass or correct. |
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, after 2@D (New Minor Forcing) it asks West about both majors. West should bid 2@S with 3 card spade support (West would have raised spades immediately with 4) or 2@H with 4 hearts.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One thing you have to decide is, what should West do when she has both 3 spades and 4 hearts. It is something you need to discuss with your partner.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But most players always bid spades rather than 2@H as NMF bidder may not always have  hearts.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Many of you may have heard that you should prefer a 4-4 fit to a 5-3 fit which would mean you should prefer bidding 2@H to 2@S. The reason some people believe that is when you have both a 4-4 fit and a 5-3 fit, you can often throw a loser or two on the 5 card suit. |
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, the 5-3 fit is much safer, because you can handle a 4-1 break much more easily and 4-1 breaks do happen 1/3 of the time. I personally bid 2@S rather than 2@H when I have both majors.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Barb has no good lead. I would have chosen a diamond. A heart might give away a trick, because of her holding. But leading a Jxx suit is also often a bad lead, so a heart could be right. As it turns out, the heart lead was a good lead.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played Ann. Now lets talk about Ann's 1NT bid. It is obviously an off shape 1NT bid. Sometimes it is the best from among the alternatives, even though 1NT should promise at least 2 spades. However, on this hand I think there are 2 slightly better alternatives, although not clearly better. |
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With such nice clubs, 2@C would be ok rather than 1N. The other alternative is to consider Ann's hand good enough to reverse—BID 2@H.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|She only has 14 HCP, and usually you need more to reverse. If you use Bergen Starting Points, you can add 2 for the 2 quality suits and 1 for the club length, making the hand worth 17. And 17 is certainly enough to justify a reverse. |
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I would have bid 2@H with Ann's hand as the best description. And if her hand had been slightly worse (make the HQ the H2 for example), I would have bid 2@C with my nice clubs. I try to avoid bidding 1N with a singleton spade unless there is no clear cut alternative.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If we change the hand a little, say @Sx @HAJ10x @DAxx @C KJxxx then 1N could very well be the best alternative. With that hand, Ann is clearly too weak to reverse, and her clubs are so-so so 1N seems like a reasonable alternative to 2@C.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think 2@H is a reasonable bid with Barb's hand. And that is probably the bid I would choose. But I would worry my hand was too good. Using Bergen "adjusted HCP" Barb's hand does meet the rule of 20.|
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|She has 9 HCP and 2 quality suits for a total of 11 "Bergen adjusted HCP" plus 10 cards in her 2 longest suit means her hand counts to 21 using the rule of 20. So 1@H is a reasonable alternative.|
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that, it has no defense. It has lots of offense. When I have a hand with 9 or sometimes even 10 HCP that meets the rule of 20, I often still open it a weak 2 bid because I think it is a better description. BTW, my style says there are no gaps between a weak 2 and an an opening of 1.|
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is impossible IMO to have a hand that is too good to open a weak 2 and not good enough to open 1. So I would open barb's hand either 2@H or 3@H. I probably choose 3, but 2 is fine and more in line with the law of total tricks. But if my pard opened 1H, I would not object.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Absent a 1@H bid I would lead a heart. But it is rarely right to lead a suit bid by the opponents. A spade if fine but lead the @SK. Partner will never figure out you have king doubleton otherwise. As it turns out the spade lead does not work well but it is a reasonable choice. Opening leads are very hard. Even the pros get them wrong a lot.|

And if I pass, as I probably should, then Ann should balance. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If it goes 1@C-P-P-?, Ann has a choice of bids. Normally with 5-4 in the majors and a choice of making a takeout double or overcalling I choose to overcall my 5 card suit. Then if I strictly followed that rule I would bid 1@S with Ann's hand. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But with 5 not so great spades and being in balancing seat, I would balance with a double with Ann's hand. And Barb should probably bid 2N over a double or even over 1S. She should not bid 3N because a balancing bid is often made with less than an opener. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2N after a balancing bid shows 13 or 14 or so. Ann would pass 2N. I think 2N has plays. With a club lead, Barb wold take 4 diamonds, 1 club, and 2 hearts for sure. That is already 7 tricks and there is a good chance she would get a spade trick as well.|

cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BBill Bryson: ^*N|cp||at|IN 1787, SOMEONE in New Jersey—exactly who now seems to be forgotten—found an enormous thighbone sticking out of a stream bank at a place called Woodbury Creek. The bone clearly didn't belong to any species of creature still alive, certainly not in New Jersey. From what little is known now, it is thought to have belonged to a hadrosaur, a large duck-billed dinosaur. At the time, dinosaurs were unknown.|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


AT|

The bone was sent to ^*BDr. Caspar Wistar^*N, the nation's leading anatomist, who described it at a meeting of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia that autumn. Unfortunately, Wistar failed completely to recognize the bone's significance and merely made a few cautious and uninspired remarks to the effect that it was indeed a whopper. He thus missed the chance, half a century ahead of anyone else, to be the discoverer of dinosaurs. Indeed, the bone excited so little interest that it was put in a storeroom and eventually disappeared altogether. So the first dinosaur bone ever found was also the first to be lost.|
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


AT|

That the bone didn't attract greater interest is more than a little puzzling, for its appearance came at a time when America was in a froth of excitement about the remains of large, ancient animals. The cause of this froth was a strange assertion by the great French naturalist the Comte de Buffon—he of the heated spheres from the previous chapter—that living things in the New World were inferior in nearly every way to those of the Old World. America, Buffon wrote in his vast and much-esteemed Histoire Naturelle, was a land where the water was stagnant, the soil unproductive, and the animals without size or vigor, their constitutions weakened by the "noxious vapors" that rose from its rotting swamps and sunless forests. In such an environment even the native Indians lacked virility. "They have no beard or body hair," Buffon sagely confided, "and no ardor for the female."|
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


NT||

cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BBill Bryson: ^*N|cp||at|Buffon's observations found surprisingly eager support among other writers, especially those whose conclusions were not complicated by actual familiarity with the country. A Dutchman named Comeille de Pauw announced in a popular work called Recherches Philosophiques sur les Américains that native American males were not only reproductively unimposing, but "so lacking in virility that they had milk in their breasts." Such views enjoyed an improbable durability and could be found repeated or echoed in European texts till near the end of the nineteenth century.|
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


AT|

Not surprisingly, such aspersions were indignantly met in America. Thomas Jefferson incorporated a furious (and, unless the context is understood, quite bewildering) rebuttal in his Notes on the State of Virginia, and induced his New Hampshire friend General John Sullivan to send twenty soldiers into the northern woods to find a bull moose to present to Buffon as proof of the stature and majesty of American quadrupeds. It took the men two weeks to track down a suitable subject. The moose, when shot, unfortunately lacked the imposing horns that Jefferson had specified, but Sullivan thoughtfully included a rack of antlers from an elk or stag with the suggestion that these be attached instead. ^*BWho in France, after all, would know?^*N|
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


AT|

Meanwhile in Philadelphia—Wistar's city—naturalists had begun to assemble the bones of a giant elephant-like creature known at first as "the great American incognitum" but later identified, not quite correctly, as a mammoth. The first of these bones had been discovered at a place called Big Bone Lick in Kentucky, but soon others were turning up all over. America, it appeared, had once been the home of a truly substantial creature—one that would surely disprove Buffon's foolish Gallic contentions.|
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


AT|

In their keenness to demonstrate the incognitum's bulk and ferocity, the American naturalists appear to have become slightly carried away. They overestimated its size by a factor of six and gave it frightening claws, which in fact came from a Megalonyx, or giant ground sloth, found nearby. Rather remarkably, they persuaded themselves that the animal had enjoyed "the agility and ferocity of the tiger," and portrayed it in illustrations as pouncing with feline grace onto prey from boulders. When tusks were discovered, they were forced into the animal's head in any number of inventive ways. One restorer screwed the tusks in upside down, like the fangs of a saber-toothed cat, which gave it a satisfyingly aggressive aspect. Another arranged the tusks so that they curved backwards on the engaging theory that the creature had been aquatic and had used them to anchor itself to trees while dozing. The most pertinent consideration about the incognitum, however, was that it appeared to be extinct—a fact that Buffon cheerfully seized upon as proof of its incontestably degenerate nature.|
PG| ***** 153 ***** |

cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BBill Bryson: ^*N|cp||at|Buffon died in 1788, but the controversy rolled on. In 1795 a selection of bones made their way to Paris, where they were examined by the rising star of paleontology, the youthful and aristocratic Georges Cuvier. Cuvier was already dazzling people with his genius for taking heaps of disarticulated bones and whipping them into shapely forms. It was said that he could describe the look and nature of an animal from a single tooth or scrap of jaw, and often name the species and genus into the bargain. Realizing that no one in America had thought to write a formal description of the lumbering beast, Cuvier did so, and thus became its official discoverer. He called it a mastodon (which means, a touch unexpectedly, "nipple-teeth").|
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


AT|

Inspired by the controversy, in 1796 Cuvier wrote a landmark paper, Note on the Species of Living and Fossil Elephants, in which he put forward for the first time a formal theory of extinctions. His belief was that from time to time the Earth experienced global catastrophes in which groups of creatures were wiped out. For religious people, including Cuvier himself, the idea raised uncomfortable implications since it suggested an unaccountable casualness on the part of Providence. To what end would God create species only to wipe them out later? The notion was contrary to the belief in the Great Chain of Being, which held that the world was carefully ordered and that every living thing within it had a place and purpose, and always had and always would. |
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


AT|

Jefferson for one couldn't abide the thought that whole species would ever be permitted to vanish (or, come to that, to evolve). So when it was put to him that there might be scientific and political value in sending a party to explore the interior of America beyond the Mississippi he leapt at the idea, hoping the intrepid adventurers would find herds of healthy mastodons and other outsized creatures grazing on the bounteous plains. Jefferson's personal secretary and trusted friend Meriwether Lewis was chosen co-leader and chief naturalist for the expedition. The person selected to advise him on what to look out for with regard to animals living and deceased was none other than Caspar Wistar.|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


AT|

In the same year—in fact, the same month—that the aristocratic and celebrated Cuvier was propounding his extinction theories in Paris, on the other side of the English Channel a rather more obscure Englishman was having an insight into the value of fossils that would also have lasting ramifications. William Smith was a young supervisor of construction on the Somerset Coal Canal. On the evening of January 5, 1796, he was sitting in a coaching inn in Somerset when he jotted down the notion that would eventually make his reputation. To interpret rocks, there needs to be some means of correlation, a basis on which you can tell that those carboniferous rocks from Devon are younger than these Cambrian rocks from Wales. |
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


NT||
%%%%
cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BBill Bryson: ^*N|cp||at|Smith's insight was to realize that the answer lay with fossils. At every change in rock strata certain species of fossils disappeared while others carried on into subsequent levels. By noting which species appeared in which strata, you could work out the relative ages of rocks wherever they appeared. Drawing on his knowledge as a surveyor, Smith began at once to make a map of Britain's rock strata, which would be published after many trials in 1815 and would become a cornerstone of modern geology. (The story is comprehensively covered in Simon Winchester's popular book The Map That Changed the World .)|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


AT|

Unfortunately, having had his insight, Smith was curiously uninterested in understanding why rocks were laid down in the way they were. "I have left off puzzling about the origin of Strata and content myself with knowing that it is so," he recorded. "The whys and wherefores cannot come within the Province of a Mineral Surveyor."|
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


AT|

Smith's revelation regarding strata heightened the moral awkwardness concerning extinctions. To begin with, it confirmed that God had wiped out creatures not occasionally but repeatedly. This made Him seem not so much careless as peculiarly hostile. It also made it inconveniently necessary to explain how some species were wiped out while others continued unimpeded into succeeding eons. Clearly there was more to extinctions than could be accounted for by a single Noachian deluge, as the Biblical flood was known. Cuvier resolved the matter to his own satisfaction by suggesting that Genesis applied only to the most recent inundation. ^*BGod, it appeared, hadn't wished to distract or alarm Moses with news of earlier, irrelevant extinctions.^*N|
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


AT|

So by the early years of the nineteenth century, fossils had taken on a certain inescapable importance, which makes Wistar's failure to see the significance of his dinosaur bone all the more unfortunate. Suddenly, in any case, bones were turning up all over. Several other opportunities arose for Americans to claim the discovery of dinosaurs but all were wasted. In 1806 the Lewis and Clark expedition passed through the Hell Creek formation in Montana, an area where fossil hunters would later literally trip over dinosaur bones, and even examined what was clearly a dinosaur bone embedded in rock, but failed to make anything of it. |
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


AT|

Other bones and fossilized footprints were found in the Connecticut River Valley of New England after a farm boy named Plinus Moody spied ancient tracks on a rock ledge at South Hadley, Massachusetts. Some of these at least survive—notably the bones of an Anchisaurus, which are in the collection of the Peabody Museum at Yale. Found in 1818, they were the first dinosaur bones to be examined and saved, but unfortunately weren't recognized for what they were until 1855. |

^B@2^*BBill Bryson: ^*N|cp||at|By this time, however, paleontological momentum had moved to England. In 1812, at Lyme Regis on the Dorset coast, an extraordinary child named Mary Anning—aged eleven, twelve, or thirteen, depending on whose account you read—found a strange fossilized sea monster, seventeen feet long and now known as the ichthyosaurus, embedded in the steep and dangerous cliffs along the English Channel.|
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


AT|

It was the start of a remarkable career. Anning would spend the next thirty-five years gathering fossils, which she sold to visitors. (She is commonly held to be the source for the famous tongue twister "^*BShe sells seashells on the seashore.^*N") She would also find the first plesiosaurus, another marine monster, and one of the first and best pterodactyls. Though none of these was technically a dinosaur, that wasn't terribly relevant at the time since nobody then knew what a dinosaur was. It was enough to realize that the world had once held creatures strikingly unlike anything we might now find.|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


AT|

It wasn't simply that Anning was good at spotting fossils—though she was unrivalled at that—but that she could extract them with the greatest delicacy and without damage. If you ever have the chance to visit the hall of ancient marine reptiles at the Natural History Museum in London, I urge you to take it for there is no other way to appreciate the scale and beauty of what this young woman achieved working virtually unaided with the most basic tools in nearly impossible conditions. The plesiosaur alone took her ten years of patient excavation. Although untrained, Anning was also able to provide competent drawings and descriptions for scholars. But even with the advantage of her skills, significant finds were rare and she passed most of her life in poverty.|
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


AT|

It would be hard to think of a more overlooked person in the history of paleontology than Mary Anning, but in fact there was one who came painfully close. His name was Gideon Algernon Mantell and he was a country doctor in Sussex.|

PG| ***** 192 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Play: Upon winning the first trick with the @SQ, you deduce from the auction that declarer is 5-5 in the red suits. Given that declarer followed to the first trick with a low spade (rather than the @S10 or the @SJ), we can also conclude that declarer must possess another spade else our partner would have led the @SJ from a suit headed by the @SJ 10.  (The @S3 lead also shows that West can have a maximum of five Spades, reinforcing the argument).|
PG| ***** 193 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Therefore we must cash the second top spade to prevent declarer from discarding it on the two top clubs (so we are envisaging declarer's shape to be 2-5-5-1). But where do we go from here? |
PG| ***** 194 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If our partner has two trump tricks (such as @HK 10 x) or a trump trick along with a diamond trick (such as @HJ x x and @DK x), then we don't need to do anything fancy as we can just sit back, relax and wait until those winners come to us. |
PG| ***** 195 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Any diamond loser(s) won't be running away because we have the club suit locked up. |
PG| ***** 196 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But we shouldn't just hope for that to happen, we must now think about the possibility that our partner does not have two trump tricks, nor a trump trick plus a diamond trick. What should we do then if that's the case? |
PG| ***** 197 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Well, if declarer has a diamond loser it is not going anywhere, and if declarer has the @DA K, the only chance to defeat the contract is to engineer two trump tricks.|
PG| ***** 198 ***** |


NT|^B@2
For example, if declarer has @HA J 10 x x or @HK J 10 x x, you are entitled to one trump trick ... or are you? In fact, with these two scenarios above you can actually get two trump tricks! |
PG| ***** 199 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You must first lead a third spade to void yourself in that suit. Now when declarer leads a heart to the jack and partner's king (or ace), partner can then return a fourth spade allowing you to uppercut declarer with the @HQ. |
PG| ***** 200 ***** |


NT|^B@2
After declarer overtrumps with the ace (or king), partner will still have the hoped-for @H9 x for an additional trump trick. |
PG| ***** 201 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The bottom line here is that when there are no apparent tricks coming from the side suits, look to the trump suit.|
PG| ***** 202 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Your possibilities range from trying to give partner an overruff, or maybe try to engineer a trump promotion for partner.|
PG| ***** 203 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The idea is to void yourself in a side suit so that when partner gets in with an anticipated entry (@HA or @HK), you will be able to uppercut declarer with your remaining relatively high trump when partner leads your void suit. |

NT|^B@2
With seven tricks on top, you will need to set up an additional two tricks. |
PG| ***** 213 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Diamonds, of course, is the obvious place to start. But you are lacking the top two Diamonds. What's the problem with that?|
PG| ***** 214 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Well, let's go through the play in our heads. East puts up a Spade honor and we win, we exit a Diamond with West taking the trick,|sk|WS|
PG| ***** 215 ***** |


AT| a Spade is returned and East cashes his Spades and gives you a trick with the @S10.|
PG| ***** 216 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With the @S10 in the bank, you still do not have enough tricks so you exit with another Diamond but this time East wins and cashes his last Spade - and one down you go. What went wrong in this picture?|sk|se|
PG| ***** 217 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West was able to continue with a Spade when he got in with a Diamond honor (we are assuming the Diamond honors are split - which is commonly the case). So what's plan B?|

The answer is, no doubt, to duck this first Spade! Our @S10 is still a second stopper, but the effect of this ducking play allows us to exhaust West out of his second Spade.|

With a Spade-less hand, West must return either a Heart, Diamond, or Club, and we are more than happy with any of those choices!|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|Let me make relevant comments. West leads the eight of Spades and East plays the Jack. How will you play 3NT?|
PG| ***** 232 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Suppose you win the first Spade trick and play a Diamond.|

AT| West will rise with the King of Diamonds and play another Spade.|

PG| ***** 235 ***** |

PG| ***** 236 ***** |


AT| East scores the King and Queen of Spades and plays a fourth round, setting up a long card in the suit. |
PG| ***** 237 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With only eight tricks at your disposal you will have to play another Diamond. East wins with the Ace and cashes his last Spade. That is one down. What could you have done about it?|
PG| ***** 238 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You should aim to remove West’s cards in the Spade suit so that when he takes his Diamond honor he will have no Spade to play.|
PG| ***** 239 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This can easily be done by ducking the first round of Spades, allowing East’s Jack to win. The defenders cannot now beat the contract. Say East plays the Spade King next. You win with the Ace and play a Diamond. |
PG| ***** 240 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Whenever West chooses to win with his King, he will have no Spade to play. Is that all there is to be said about the hand?|
PG| ***** 241 ***** |


NT|^B@2
No, because East can prevent such a first-round hold-up if he plays cleverly at Trick 1. It is fairly obvious from South’s leap all the way to 3NT that he has a double Spade stop. |
PG| ***** 242 ***** |


NT|^B@2
East should therefore play the nine of Spades at Trick 1, forcing declarer to take one of his stoppers (the ten) immediately.|up|9|

Now West has a Spade left when he takes the King of Diamonds. The Spades are cleared and the contract, once again, tumbles to defeat. |pc|djdkd2d4|
