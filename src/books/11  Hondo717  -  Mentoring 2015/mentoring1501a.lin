^bPEARLs - 52 FACTS OF BRIDGE LIFE By Eddie Kantar (50 and 52) |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/5vo9kx^*N
|CP||va|4|AT|
^b@2^*B50^*N. Play the cards you are known to hold from the lead and third hand's play.

Say the queen is led and dummy has x-x-x-x. You, the declarer, have the K-J doubleton. When third hand plays the ace, the king and jack are equals; however, third hand knows you have the king from the lead of the queen, but doesn't know you have the jack. If you play the king under the ace, the ^*BJack^*N remains a mystery card. The opening leader also knows you have the king from partner's play of the ace. Get rid of that king! Remember, you are not costing yourself a trick when you make these plays because you have an equal to the card you are unloading in either your hand or dummy. Say the jack is led, dummy has 9-x-x-x, and you have Q-10 doubleton. When third hand plays the king, drop the queen. Why? The queen is a card they both know you hold. Third hand knows it from the lead of the jack and the opening leader knows it from the play of the king. You might as well show them your hand if you don't play that queen!

^*B51^*N. When drawing trumps try to keep a flexible entry position after trumps are drawn. 
Ideally you want to be able to enter dummy in the trump suit and also be able to enter your hand with a trump. Say you have the K-Q-J-4-3-2 and dummy has the A-10-5. If you play the ace and king, you have an entry to dummy with the 10 and you can get back to your hand by overtaking the 10. If you play the K-Q, you block the trump suit. You can get to dummy with the ace, but you can't get back to your hand with a trump.

^*B52^*N. If you have a number of equal honors and you want second hand to cover the first honor, lead your highest equal honor. 

If you don't want second hand to cover, lead your second highest equal honor. It works! Say you have the Q-J-10-9-x of trump and dummy has the K-x-x. If there is a danger of a ruff, lead the jack. If second hand has the ace, he may duck thinking partner has the queen and the ruff may be lost. Say dummy has the A-Q-x-x without a side suit entry and you have J-10 doubleton. If you need three tricks in the suit, lead the 10. Second hand, holding the king, is apt to play low thinking partner may have the jack. You can then lead to the queen for three tricks. If second hand covers, the suit is blocked and you can take only two tricks.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even if Mary doesn't open 2D, they get there because, as I told Faye, it goes 1@C-1@D-1@H-2@D. The very bad diamond break did her in. However, before drawing trump Mary should play clubs pitching hearts.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I will ruff the 3rd round with one of my natural trump tricks, but then she is only down 1. That should be an above average result, because lots of people will panic with Faye's hand and keep bidding and get too high.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So remember, if partner preempts and you have a singleton, don't try to rescue them. Just pass. Their hand is usually worthless except for their long suit. so you will have to take most of your tricks with just your hand. Whereas if you pass, then some of pard's long trump will take some tricks as well.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are 2 popular ways to deal with interference over 1N. One method is called Lebensohl. It is the most complicated convention I know, so I don't recommend you play it. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I recommend you play systems on plus "stolen bid doubles" (which doesn't apply here). That means all bids by Mary retain the same meaning as if Judy had passed. So 2@C here is still Stayman. Had Judy, for example, bid 2@C, then a "stolen bid double" of 2@C would have been Stayman.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You could make a case that Judy with a quality 5 card club suit (quality = 3 honors) should bid 3N, but 2N is fine. In general, especially in IMPs, I tend to want to bid 3N over 2N. So the only time I pass 2N in IMPs is with 15 or a bad 16. |
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But Mary has 16 and a quality spade suit and 3N is a good bid. End even if it goes down, unless 2N makes exactly, in IMPs it doesn't matter much.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The standard lead from AJ10 is the J and if you want to play that, it is fine. But some experts like to play that the J is only led when you have no higher honor (this is sometime called "jack denies"). Therefore, if you play that, and you lead the J your pard knows you have nothing higher. |
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So what happens if you have AJ10 or KJ10. Then you play what is known as "coded 10s". If you lead the 10, it shows either a) nothing higher than the 10 or b) a broken sequence with the J (AJ10 or KJ10). Some people who play coded 10s explain it as "0 or 2 higher". Although that is true, it is an incomplete explanation because you don't lead the 10 from AQ10 (even though you have 2 higher). |
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, a "coded 10" specifically shows AJ10 or KJ10 (or nothing higher than the 10). Experts also play "coded 9s" which is very similar.If you lead the 9 you have either a) nothing higher than the 9 or b) a broken sequence  with the 10 (e.g A109 K109 or Q109). So on this hand Faye and I will play coded 10s and I will therefore lead the @H10. So Faye knows I probably have AJ10 or KJ10.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Unlike last hand, this hand Mary was very lucky but she also played it well. She gave herself the only chance to make. So remember, it always pays to be optimistic in bridge. If there is any hope to make a contract, play to do so. Sometimes you do get lucky. Mary needed 3-3 diamonds plus the spade finesse working. That is less than 20% but its not 0%. Therefore, if you can think of a way to make a contract, however remote, play for everything to work out.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We have a couple of interesting bidding decisions with this hand. The first question is should Faye bid 1@S or 2@S. Personally, although I love to preempt, I would only bid 1@S with Faye's hand. She has a nice hand, with a quality 6-card suit, an outside ace. So although 2@S could work out well, in that it gets her length across, it is a slight underbid. |
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Then the question is, how many spades should Judy bid. I would bid 3@S using the LOTT to start with. Perhaps the opps will let us play 3@S. But if the opps bid 4@H I would use the "bid 4@S over 4@H" rule and bid 4@S with Judy's hand. Therefore, you could argue that 4@S is a reasonable bid. Perhaps you will induce a 5@H bid.|

Here’s a holiday surprise that only the dictionary can provide. Do you find the word "Xmas," as an abbreviation for Christmas, offensive? Many people do. |CP|1|AT|^*Hblog.dictionary.com/xmas-christogram/^*N|CP||AT|

You won’t find Xmas in church songbooks or even on many greeting cards. Xmas is popularly associated with a trend towards materialism, and sometimes the target of people who decry the emergence of general "holiday" observance instead of particular cultural and religious ritual.

But the history of the word "Xmas" is actually more respectable — and fascinating — than you might suspect. First of all, the abbreviation predates by centuries its use in gaudy advertisements. It was first used in the mid 1500s. X is the Greek letter "chi," the initial letter in the word ???st??. And here’s the kicker: ???st?? means "Christ." X has been an acceptable representation of the word "Christ" for hundreds of years. This device is known as a Christogram. The mas in Xmas is the Old English word for "mass."  In the same vein, the dignified terms Xpian and Xtian have been used in place of the word "Christian."

As lovers of the alphabet, we are transfixed by the flexibility of "X." The same letter can represent the sacred, the profane ("rated X"), and the unknown ("X-ray"). What does the "X" in Xbox stand for? Find out more about the 24th letter of the alphabet, here. |CP|1|AT|^*Hblog.dictionary.com/x/^*N|CP||AT|
