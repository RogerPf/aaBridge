^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I applaud Millie for realizing she had such a nice hand even with only 9 HCP. Personally, although the hand does meet the rule of 20 technically, I think I would open 4@D or 3@D with her hand. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Assuming Stan has 2 diamonds (a reasonable assumption, although not 100% clear) Millie has 5 losers outside diamonds. The question is, does Stan have at least 4 honors to cover those losers. I would say the odds are that he does not. So I would pass 3N in Match Points for sure. |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In IMPs, it is an interesting question as to whether or not to pull 3N to 5@D. As you know, in general I very much favor 3N to 5 of a minor. But on this hand, it is certainly reasonable for West to decide 5@D is safer than 3N— a rare case. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Unfortunately because of the horrible (and very unlikely) diamond break, 5@D and 3N both go down. In theory 3N could make if I lead a heart and if Stan decides to play a diamond to the J. But I think that is an incorrect play.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Against perfect defense 4@S should go down. So let me first discuss the defense and then Anna's choices of bids. The club lead was ok. Stan probably should not put up the @CK. It is barely possible that Millie has Q109 of clubs but, more likely the 10 is top of nothing. |
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So Stan should guess that I have AQJ of clubs and not put up the king. However, that is not crucial. What is crucial is that Millie should not ruff with the @SK. When you have a choice of whether or not to ruff with a natural trump trick, almost always it is wrong to ruff. |
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case, the @SK is a natural trump trick and Millie should just pitch on the @CJ. However, even ruffing with the @SK worked out ok. What she should not do is lead another spade. Because that may be picking up the suit for me, as she did.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What I am probably going to do is assume the remaining spades are 2-2, or that Millie has the @S10. I am not going to play Stan for having A10x of spades. Therefore, I will end up losing 3 spades and a diamond. |
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Perfect defense is hard. As I am sure you see on many hands, the defenders make many more mistakes than declarer which is why aggressive bidding pays off. Even if you are in a bad contract, often the defense will slip and let you make as on this hand.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now should Anna consider her hand a game force?|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


AT| If you don't think we should be in game, then you should consider passing.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you think you want to play in game, you should put 3N, 4@H, and 4@S in to play. So, what you should do, assuming you play regular Stayman is to bid 3@C. If I bid 3@D, you bid 3@S showing 5 spades and 4 hearts. If I bid 3@H or 3@S then obviously you bid 4.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Playing Puppet Stayman, you have a tougher choice. Puppet Stayman is used to discover if opener has a 5 card major. If opener has no majors he bids 3N, not 3@D. |
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In case playing Puppet, Anna cannot bid 3@C planning to bid 3@S if I bid 3@D. So if playing Puppet, if I decided not to pass with Anna's hand I would bid it as she did as it is more likely we should be in either spades or NT than hearts.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Millie has a clear 3N bid. I think too many players pass 2N when they should not. You should almost always bid 3N over 2N. There is little upside to playing in 2N. Unless you make it exactly you might as well be in 3N. So my advice is to almost always bid 3N over 2N unless you have a 4x3 6 count.|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The diamond finesse, if it works, will provide her with an extra diamond trick. And if diamonds are 3-3 it makes. Or she has to hope I can't get in once clubs are established.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not the way I would have bid the hand but it worked out and an auction that had merit. In this case leading the unbid suit turns out not to be correct, but it is right more often than not and is what I would lead at a real game where I could not see all 4 hands.|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the bidding, normally with 5 spades and 4 hearts you bid 1@S and that is what I would have done with Millie's hand. However, here is the problem. You could easily lose the heart suit, if Millie bids 1@S, when Anna rebids 1NT or 2@C over 1@S.  She could easily have 4 hearts and they would miss their 4-4 heart fit. That is why I said 1@H was not totally unreasonable.|
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, if I have 5 spades and 4 hearts and a weak hand, I still almost always bid 1@S. The only time I might bid 1@H is if I have strong hearts and weak spades, something like @S10xxxx @HAQxx @Cxx @Dxx.|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|All considered, I would have bid 1@S. I hope Anna then would bid 4@S or 4@H actually (a splinter showing a game forcing hand 4 spades and a singleton heart). Over 1@S I think Millie should probably only bid 2@S. 3@S should show around 11 points. She has 7 HCP, 1 length point, and 2 for the doubletons, which is 10. In any case the final contract is correct.|

Although shorty after the discovery of Neptune the presence of a ninth planet, then called Planet X, was suspected. On February 18, 1930, Tombaugh by laboriously looking at the two photographs from the same section of the sky taken several days apart by a 13-inch astrograph identified an object that could fill the role as the missing planet. Each photograph could contain more than 150,000 stars. However, when the two plates were compared all stayed in the same place except the one which blinked or changed place—Plane X. Subsequent photographs confirmed the moving body.

According to Dr. Elizabeth Vandiver, chair of the Department of Classics in Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, to clarify the origins of the name: "Pluto is the name of the Roman god of the Underworld, equivalent to the Greek Hades. However, the Greek name "Plouton" (from which the Romans derived their name "Pluto") was also occasionally used as an alternative name for Hades. But Pluto is definitely the Roman spelling."|

After years of arguments astronomers voted to strip Pluto of its planet status in 2006. The International Astronomical Union's (IAU) said that, among several other concerns—its highly elliptical orbit overlaps with that of Neptune—Pluto failed to dominate its orbit around the Sun in the same way as the other planets and voted to strip Pluto of its status as a planet in 2006.|

The need for a strict definition was deemed necessary after more technologically advanced telescopes began to reveal far-off objects that rivalled Pluto in size

Without a new definition, the discoveries raised the prospect that there would soon me 50 or more planets in the Solar System.
The scientists agreed that for a celestial body to qualify as a planet:
• it must be in orbit around the Sun
• it must be large enough that it takes on a nearly round shape
• it has cleared its orbit of other objects|

Since the early 1990s, astronomers had found several objects of comparable size to Pluto in an outer region of the Solar System called the Kuiper Belt. The critical blow for Pluto came with the discovery in 2003 of ^*BEris^*N. After being measured with the Hubble Space Telescope, it was shown to be bigger than Pluto. Images sent back by New Horizons now suggest Pluto is bigger than Eris but, Pluto may never regain its previous glory—being considered a Planet.|

Further, starting in 1992, astronomers have become aware of a vast population of small bodies orbiting the sun beyond Neptune. There are at least 70,000 "trans-Neptunians" with diameters larger than 100 km in the radial zone extending outwards from the orbit of Neptune (at 30 AU) to 50 AU (1 Astronomical Unit = 149 597 871 kilometers). Observations show that the trans-Neptunians are mostly confined within a thick band around the ecliptic, leading to the realization that they occupy a ring or belt surrounding the sun. This ring is generally referred to as the ^*BKuiper Belt^*N.|

After the sun formed, the remaining dust and gas evolved into the planets that make up our solar system. This means that most of them orbit on a nearly flat plane in relation to one another. But after its formation, Pluto wound up out of sync, its orbit tipped to an angle of about 17 degrees in relation to this plane.|

The Pluto's orbit is also highly elliptical, making it a very stretched-out circle. This allows the Pluto to dip inside of the orbit of Neptune for 20 of the 248 years it takes the Pluto to orbit the sun. Pluto last entered Neptune's orbit on Feb. 7, 1979, where it remained until Feb. 11, 1999. Its highly elliptical orbit means that the atmosphere of the dwarf planet changes over time, expanding and contracting as its components freeze and melt.|

Many think of Pluto as sitting at the outer edge of the solar system, given the fact that it was once our most distant planet. But part of the reason for Pluto's reassignment as a "dwarf" is the fact that it's really, really not the last stop before interstellar space. In fact, it's in the very inside of something called the Kuiper Belt -- an asteroid belt full of space objects much more mysterious than Pluto.|

This ring is generally referred to as the ^*BKuiper Belt^*N. The Kuiper Belt is far enough from the sun that it basically acts as a cosmic refrigerator, keeping its objects cool and pristine, largely unchanged from their state at birth (at least compared with the incredibly dynamic planets cooking in our own neighborhood). And the objects are old -- about as old as the solar system itself. So opening up that Kuiper ice box can give scientists a glimpse of the building materials present at the dawn of our solar system. Understanding what was there then can help us figure out how more complex planets -- ones that can harbor life -- evolve.|

First, it is likely that the Kuiper Belt objects are extremely primitive remnants from the early accretional phases of the solar system. The inner, dense parts of the pre-planetary disk condensed into the major planets, probably within a few millions to tens of millions of years. The outer parts were less dense, and accretion progressed slowly. Evidently, a great many small objects were formed. Second, it is widely believed that the Kuiper Belt is the source of the short-period comets. |

As to Dwarf planet, we should not get hung up on the term "planet." The eight that we call Plant are not alike. Jupiter and Saturn are compositionally similar—big balls of hydrogen and helium that make them gas giants. Uranus and Neptune appear to have large concentrations of hot "ices," compressed gasses in hot solid states that gives them the classification of an ice giant. Then there are the four terrestrial planets—closest to Sun, which are ultimately not so dissimilar in nature.|

The same is true for the asteroids in the asteroid belts and the objects in the Kuiper Belt. The composition of the Kuiper Belt Objects seems to point to a common origin, around the formation of the solar system. Each is a bit of debris from that time, in varying scales. Some very big, some very small. Dwarf planet, then, is just another category. Dwarf planet is a word to describe space objects that look and act in a similar way. In all likelyhood, there are 48 Dwarf Planets. If all 48 were counted as planets, there would be 56 planets in our solar system.|

Pluto has a variety of ices in its crust, not just water and methane ice. There are geologic features we saw recently on both small planets that indicate crustal motion and not just mere passive cratering of a dead surface. There are mountain ranges on Pluto, chasms as large as our Grand Canyon on Charon, and some areas on both worlds with no craters, indicating extreme youth and geologic activity. Cryovolcanoes, liquid nitrogen geysers, and other active geologic processes have already set Pluto and Charon apart from other icy bodies orbiting the giant planets of the outer Solar System, especially as the heat source for such activity is not immediately obvious.|

Pluto and Charon are actually a double planet system. Charon itself shows complex geologic features as well as Pluto. Pluto's other moons are not planets, but small ice balls or pieces of older planets captured by Pluto. Pluto, Charon, Triton and the other small planets in the outer Solar System all have complex geologic histories. As Washington University's William McKinnon puts it, these planets have differentiated into core-mantle-crust, some have active atmospheres and weather, and all sorts of interesting things going on, some even having a liquid water mantle, as we suspect Pluto and Charon to have.|

It was also announced that New Horizons spoutted nitrogen escaping from Pluto's atmosphere. The find suggests that Pluto may be losing its atmosphere more rapidly than previously thought, offering a tantalizing hint about its possible replenishment source.

This frozen region is north of Pluto’s icy mountains, in the center-left of the heart feature, informally named “Tombaugh Regio” (Tombaugh Region) after Clyde Tombaugh, who discovered Pluto in 1930.|

There, a sheet of ice clearly appears to have flowed—and may still be flowing—in a manner similar to glaciers on Earth.|

The large crater highlighted in the image is about 30 miles (50 kilometers) wide, approximately the size of the greater Washington, DC area.|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|You are holding another poor hand here. Oh well, nothing to do with you - why not have a little doze and gaze out of the window? Because partner will give you a real tongue-lashing at the end of the hand, that's why! You can (and should) play a pivotal role on this deal. |

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|That's a very threatening dummy. Those Diamonds look to be a real source of tricks in 3NT - if we can't take five tricks quickly declarer will have a cake-walk to his contract.
 
What's worse is that we have no entry to this hand to return partner's suit.|

You've also suggested four Spades with your low Spade discard.|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|East-West reach 3NT quickly and partner leads the @S4, which we assume is from a long suit. We (South) contribute the @S10 and West takes the @SQ. This is clever play by West who wants North to know that he has the @SK – this way North will be discouraged from leading another Spade if he gains the lead with the @DA. Crafty stuff – politicians call it "leaking information".|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Declarer starts on his Diamonds, naturally enough, and we have to decide what to throw on the second round. Declarer is pleased that North has the @DA; West is hoping that North will shift to another suit in a vain attempt to find an entry in your hand for a Spade return.|
PG| ***** 204 ***** |

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|So what should you pitch on the second and third rounds of Diamonds? You might throw a low Heart and a low Club but partner might not get the message – the first discard should be the @S3. This shows that your Spade holding was originally from a four-card suit. |
PG| ***** 205 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|(Partner can read it as such as he can see the @S2). You can chuck a low Heart on the next Diamond, but by now partner knows what to do.|
PG| ***** 206 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Knowing that declarer only started with two Spades North lays down the @SA (on which you must unblock the @SJ!) and cashes out the suit.|
