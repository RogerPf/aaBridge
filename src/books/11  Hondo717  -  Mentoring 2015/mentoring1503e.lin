^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You hope that Mary has at least one diamond honor. If she does, you can get a 2nd diamond at least. You can lead the @DQ. |
PG| ***** 9 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If Mary covers you have a guaranteed 2nd diamond. If she does not and I win the @DK, you then have to hope Mary has the @DJ.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A couple of things to discuss here. One is the diamond suit. When you have a suit missing the K and J but you have the A Q 10 9. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The best way to play that suit is to hope the person behind the ace has at least 1 honor and take 2 finesses, as Faye did here. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That way you will win 2 tricks 75% of the time because, when missing 2 honors the odds of 1 opponent having at least 1 of those honors is 75%. Let me explain why those odds exist. On this hand there are 4 possible distributions of the diamond honors.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So 3 out of 4 times (e.g. 75%) playing 2 finesses will net you at least 2 diamond tricks. This is an example of a "suit combination" and is one worth remembering.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other thing I want to mention is "quick tricks" and how they can be used to decide whether or not to upgrade your hand. Some people would not open Judy's hand. But that is wrong for 2 reasons.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First of all it meets the rule of 20. And second, Judy has 3 "quick tricks". A quick trick is the number of tricks you can take in a suit in the first 2 rounds. Judy has the @SAK|HC|SAK|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


AT| and @DA |HC|DA|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


AT|for 3 quick tricks. There are 8 total quick tricks available (2 in each suit). |
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are 40 HCP available. So, HCP divided by 8 quick tricks means a quick trick is worth around 5 points. Any hand where your number of quick tricks times 5 is more than the number of HCP, it is an upgradeable hand.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So on this hand, from a quick trick perspective, Judy's hand is worth 15 "quick trick" points but she only has 12 HCP—it should be upgraded. |
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, let me change the hand. Give it only 2 quick tics but keep the same number of HCP.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Regarding opening lead from 3 small, there are 3 alternatives (one of which I really dislike). A. You can lead count from 3 small (e.g. lead low). B. You can lead attitude. That means a low card shows an honor a high spot denies an honor. So a high spot from 3 small denies an honor|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|C. Some people lead "middle" as a compromise. but all that compromise does is tell partner nothing about either your count or your high cards.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You and your partner need to decide whether you think attitude is more important or count is more important and pick one or the other. Most people prefer attitude on BBO so they lead high from 3 small.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I happen to prefer count (because I actually count out hands) so I like low. But high is probably better for most people.|

PG| ***** 82 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, I bid too quickly. My bid was 2@C. But, for the sake making a few relevant points let us assume that I am 5-3 in the majors and my correct bid indeed was 2@H. |
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Then my 3NT bid gives Judy a choice between 4@S and 3N. she should choose 4@S anytime you have 3+ spades. 3N is not a closeout. It is a choice of games after a transfer.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT|^B@2
rattray:  I thought close out.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I should have bid 2@C with 5 spades and 4 hearts and then over Judy's 2@D, I should bid 3@S. The auction 1N-2@C-2@D-3@S shows 5 spades and 4 hearts and a game forcing hand. And that is how I should bid my hand. Some people play a convention called "Smolen."|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't think it is necessary but it is pretty popular. It is used when responder to 1N is 5-4 in the majors with a game forcing hand, as I am. It works similar to the suggested bidding, but has a slight twist. |
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If it goes 1N-2@C-2@D, and you are 5-4 in the majors with a game force hand and play Smolen, you jump in your 4 card major. So on this hand, I would bid 3@H playing Smolen rather than 3@S. The idea behind Smolen is to allow the strong hand to be declarer.|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So by bidding 3@H, playing Smolen, I am announcing I have 4 hearts and 5 spades, and Judy ends up bidding spades first when she has 3 spades (as on this hand). That way the strong hand ends up as declarer.|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't think for most players the confusion is worth playing Smolen. I guarantee if you decide to play it. Your partnership will screw it up the first few times it comes up.|
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But if you want to play it, so long as you remember it, it is probably slightly better than not playing it, but not as much better as most people think.|
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other point on this hand is, as you gain more experience, you should try and not only count out trump, which most everyone does, but your 2nd longest suit as well. |
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, Judy should have kept track of both spades and clubs. Your 2nd longest suit, especially when there is a side 5-card suit, can often be set up. |
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is not that hard to keep track of the second suit. You already know how to keep track of trump, so keeping track of a 2nd suit can be done the same way.|
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other point which is hard for Judy to see is when she played low club from dummy and put up the @CQ. Instead, based on the opening lead, she should have played club 8. But that is a minor nit.|

^*BIRS^*N stands for "Internal Revenue Service," the bureau of the Department of the United States Treasury responsible for collecting taxes. Satirized as being able to "squeeze blood from a rock," the IRS makes sure that every citizen is paying his or her civic dues. The agency began during the Civil War when Congress, under the direction of President Abraham Lincoln, created the office of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to enact an income tax to cover war expenses. Though the name officially changed to IRS in 1953, the taxes are here to stay.|

[than-uh-top-sis] |CP|1|AT|^*Hstatic.sfdict.com/staticrep/dictaudio/T01/T0194000.mp3^*N|CP||AT| If you're ruminating on life's harsh realities, perhaps it's time you join a long tradition of creative taxpayers and write a thanatopsis. From the Greek thantos meaning "death" and -opsis meaning "a view," a ^*Bthanatopsis^*N is a written contemplation of death, often composed in the form of a poem. The 17th century American poet William Cullen Bryant delineated the style with his poem ^*BThanatopsis^*N. It might be comforting to think that when the "Earth that nourish'd thee...claim[s] thy growth," thy tax dollars will have gone toward planting the tree thou fertilize'th. |

^*BForm 1040^*N is the US Individual Tax Return, the primary form used by the IRS for personal federal income taxes. The first Form 1040 was written in 1912, a time when the IRS (then known as the Bureau of Internal Revenue) had fewer than ^*B50 employees^*N. It is alleged that Nina Wilcox Putnam, a young accountant who went on to become a successful screenwriter, composed the form that generations of taxpayers would use yearly to determine their bill. The first complete form was not approved for use until its fortieth draft and was thus dubbed the ^*B1040^*N.|

A ^*BDependent^*N [dih-pen-duhnt] |CP|1|AT| ^*Htinyurl.com/ksv846l^*N|CP||AT| in American English, or a dependant in British English, is a person who relies or "depends" on someone else as their primary source of income. This is most often a child, spouse, parent, or other relative. If you find yourself supporting a dependent, you can list them on your tax forms and claim a deduction or possibly an exemption. The word is derived from the Latin dependere meaning "to hang down," and although your dependents may hang on you financially, they can certainly lighten your taxes.|

Certain charitable organizations or individuals with a high number of dependents or extremely low incomes as well as veterans and clergymen can receive tax exemptions, and if you've ever bought anything from a duty free shop in an international airport, you've already enjoyed a small one. The word is derived from the Latin exemptus meaning "removed."|

^B@2^*BMM: When we first looked at this deal, we thought it is an easy grand slam and what is the big deal. So let us go on and listen to Andy.^*N|
PG| ***** 225 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As declarer, you should always formulate a plan even if you can see the most obvious play. As potential problems you may be facing is either East or West might have four hearts In that case There are two things you can do.|
PG| ***** 226 ***** |


NT|^B@2
(1) If trumps break 2-1, we can then ruff out the heart suit. |
PG| ***** 227 ***** |


NT|^B@2
What if trumps are 3-0?|
PG| ***** 228 ***** |


AT|

If trumps are 3-0, then we hope that the person with three trumps also has all four hearts (or that hearts break 3-2). That way, we will still be able to ruff out the hearts without needing to be afraid that it is going to be trumped.|
PG| ***** 229 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, there is a second thing that you can hope for, although it is very unlikely to happen - try to work it out what it is because this is a grand slam after all, you want to take as many chances as possible!
|
PG| ***** 230 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Here, with all tricks in sight barring bad breaks, you should look for a layout that might cause big problems for your contract. What might this problem be? |
PG| ***** 231 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If spades break 3-0, someone just might have four hearts. If trumps break 2-1, you can easily ruff a heart in dummy to set up the suit (assuming hearts don't break 5-0).|
PG| ***** 232 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But what if trumps break 3-0 like here? |

PG| ***** 234 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
(2) Someone has exactly @CQ x tight. 

To combine both chances you must first draw two rounds of trumps. Then unblock the @CK and go to dummy with a heart (not the @SJ since you might need it to ruff out a heart). |

Now cash the @CA to discard a heart. If the @CQ pops draw the last trump and cash the @CJ to discard another heart.|
PG| ***** 241 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If the @CQ doesn't pop, cash a second round of hearts. If this lives you can draw trumps because hearts are breaking 3-2.|

PG| ***** 244 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If East has all four hearts then West will show out - you'll play a heart to our queen and ruff a heart in dummy. |
PG| ***** 245 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Yes, if East has a singleton heart you will go down - but you were always destined to go down anyway.|
PG| ***** 246 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On this deal hearts were breaking 3-2 all along, but it is always a good idea to think about the possible situations where your contract might be in danger, and formulate a plan to counter it - without jeopardizing the contract when everything was breaking friendly all along.|

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|7-5 shapes are very difficult to bid and usually there is no "right" answer given the freaky shape. |
PG| ***** 252 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Over North's 1NT rebid showing 12-14, South can bid 3@H which shows a game forcing hand with at least 5-5 in both majors. North will then bid 3@S to confirm spades as trumps. 

South can then cuebid 4@C (1st or 2nd round control cuebid) and North will cooperate with a 4@H cuebid (also 1st or 2nd round control cuebid).|
PG| ***** 253 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Because North's 4@H cuebid had bypassed a 4@D cuebid, this means North has denied 1st or 2nd round control in diamonds. This is good news for South because South can now ask for key cards, knowing that the @DA won't be one of those keycards. |
PG| ***** 254 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Here, North will respond 5@H which means two Key Cards without the @SQ. South knows that it is the @HA and the @CA (since North cannot have a diamond control cuebid). |
PG| ***** 255 ***** |


NT|^B@2
South then bids 5NT asking for specific kings, to which North replies with 6@H showing the @HK (and no other kings). |
PG| ***** 256 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This is the perfect reply that South wanted to hear, and bids the grand knowing that it will be close to a cold contract. |
