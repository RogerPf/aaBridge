^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not sure why Mary didn't lead a heart. Club worked out ok. Now let me discuss the play. This is a tricky hand in terms of managing entries. The suit that Judy needs to worry about the most is spades. The other suits pretty much take care of themselves. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So after ruffing the club, Judy should play the @DA and a low diamond towards dummy. She should then play a spade. BTW, this is one of the few instances where Mary should duck the spade smoothly. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason being the following (it is much easier to see this position if Judy were dummy). If she takes the @SA then Judy is forced to play spades correctly by finessing the @SJ the next time spades are played.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But if she ducks smoothly, Judy may decide I have the @SA and play the @SQ when I duck a 2nd time. I have noticed that many students duck aces too often. I am not saying you should avoid ducking aces but you need a reason. And the spade position is a common one where ducking the ace is the correct play. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But lots of times aces are ducked when they should not be. So long as your ace captures and honor (usually a king or queen) it is ok not to duck.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let us see how 3@H does. We have 3 heart tricks 3 club tricks and a spade for sure. It looks like it is down 2. As I said a pass was very reasonable by Mary. I would have done the same thing actually despite my guidelines. But most people are too conservative so I hate to admit that :).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very unlucky hand for Faye. Had Mary passed  it probably starts 1@H-2@D and they probably end up in 4@H which really works out badly because of the trump split. So in this case the preempt got them to what turned out to be a better contract but only because of the horrendous heart split.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|N/S lose 2 Diamonds and a club to start with and pending on how we play spades maybe a spade. I would probably try and set up clubs. So would likely end up going down 1 or maybe make it if I try and cash the @SA rather than finessing. Pretty interesting hand.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT|^B@2
msphola:  With 10 spades, don't you play for the king drop?|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, with 3 spades out the finesse is better because they are more likely to be 2-1 with the king in the hand with 2. In the rare 11 card fit, missing the king, it is slightly better to play for the drop but just barely. However with a 10-card fit missing just the queen you play for the drop for sure.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You should not always be unilateral. But there are some hands where you know what it very likely to be your best spot after a round or two of bidding. And when you do, you should just bid it and avoid "bidding accidents."|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here I will just bid 1@H, showing fewer than 10. But Let me review bids over a double. First of all you are not obligated to say anything once there is a takeout double, even when you have 6 points. You should say something if you have something to say, but pass is ok if you have nothing useful to say.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What I like to play, if I have something to say, is not standard but I think it is useful. I like to play that if I make any bid but redouble (or 2NT which I will discuss shortly) I have less than 10 points. That means no bids other than redouble and 2N are forcing.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, most people play that 1 level bids are forcing and, although they don't promise 10 points, you can have 10 or more points. So they play if I bid, for example, 1@H that is a 1 round force (just as if Judy had passed). But, they play 2-level bids are not forcing and deny 10 points. So if I bid 2@C that can be weaker than 1@H and, in fact, denies 10 points.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think that is rather confusing and counter-intuitive, so I play both 1@H and 2@C deny 10 points. In my style 2NT is a limit raise or better.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The auction was fine. Mary could try 2@C over 1N, but with 5 very quacky points and being vul, pass is probably better. Let me discuss the lead. The lead of an ace or king against NT has special meaning.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In NT the lead of the king asks partner to give attitude—high with any honor, low with no honor. You usually lead a K from KQ10xx or KQJx or occasionally AK10xx.|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The lead of an ace has a very specific meaning. It is usually done from a suit that is almost running, often AKJ10x or something like that. It asks partner to drop an honor if they have one (the K, Q, or J). If they don't have an honor they give count. That way the leader can figure out whether or not the suit is running.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The lead of an ace against NT is pretty rare. The lead of a king is not that usual but it does occur from time to time.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I had decided to lead hearts from Judy's hand, I would have led a low heart, 4th best. On a different auction a low heart is a very reasonable lead. But on this auction, where I bid hearts it is not likely to be Judy's best lead. |
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You should avoid leading natural suits the opponents have bid. If I make an artificial bid you can certainly lead that suit (say I had bid 2@C Stayman on another hand, then a club lead is fine). However, it is rarely right to lead a natural suit the opponents have bid. If you make it a rule never to do that, you will come out way ahead.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand I would have led  spade which works out rather badly as it turns out. The best lead is a club but there is no way to know that unless Mary bids them.|

cafaba:  Did not want to reverse.|
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Many people would open Faye's hand 1@D, but I am not one of those people :). The problem Faye is trying to solve is, if she opens 1@C and I bid 1@S, what is she supposed to bid now. She cant bid 2@D as that is a reverse.|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So many people with 4 diamonds and 5 clubs open 1@D and rebid 2@C. However I have a big problem with that approach If you do that, how does partner know which minor to take a preference to. Do you have 4 diamonds and 5 clubs, 5 diamond and 4 clubs, who knows?|
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I open her hand 1@C. Then over 1@S I can decide to bid either 1N (my choice) or 2@C. Rather than lying about my distribution on the opener, I may never have to lie, but if I do I can do it later.|
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


NT|^B@2
EddyHaskel: And you may be rebidding 1N with a stiff in pard's suit which I hate|
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Dave can decide to open 1@C and rebid 2@C with the North hand if he hates bidding 1N with a singleton spade :). Anyway, that is why I don't like opening 1@D with 4 diamonds and 5 clubs. But as you can see, lots of people disagree with me.|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next the question is should Judy have bid over 2@C and surprisingly (since everyone knows I hate to pass) I would have passed with Judy's hand. Partner rates to have virtually nothing. North opened, South bid. so they have close to 20 points between them. Naturally, I am not eager to play 2N opposite 0 points. so I pass and hope to defend.|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I do like to bid, but I put more value on distribution and less on high cards than a lot of people. A 12 point hand with a 7-card suit is often worth more than an 18 point flat hand. It turns out when I have a very strong but flat hand and both opponents have bid, the best course is usually to pass once you are beyond 1NT.|

Lets without an apostrophe is the third-person singular form of the verb let, meaning "to allow or permit": She lets the dog out every morning. Let's with an apostrophe is a contraction of "let us," which is used in all varieties of speech and writing to introduce a suggestion or request: Let us consider all the facts. Because "let us" often sounds overly formal, the contracted form, let's occurs more frequently in colloquial speech and writing: Let's go, Tigers! Let's forget this ever happened.|

Sometimes you'll see redundancy with the use of let's: Let's you and me get out of here. This, of course, literally means, "Let us you and me get out of here." If "you and me" is treated as an aside here, it can function to elaborate on the subject for emphasis and clarification. However, if not treated as an aside, the above example would be considered nonstandard English.|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


AT|

Whether it's intentional or not, the fact remains the same: let's and lets are commonly misunderstood. Let's be kind to folks like Carolyn, and double check our apostrophe use next time we're cheering for our favorite team.

Let's go, grammar lovers!|

fp||cp||ht|d|at|^B@2The next five boards are my (Kia, BBO nickname "nome) conversion of free "Hand of the Week" from Vu-Bridge |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/hw3ctx^*N|CP||AT| distributed by Baron Barclay Bridge Supplies. The five boards are authored by a French Bridge expert and all the instructions are in French. The theme is "Quelques donnes de test" [Some give test]—by my translation. 

Regardless, I thought they would be interesting and useful though somewhat old fashioned. I had fun doing them and they have been in my computer for two years and I need to get them out. I did my best translating the instructions using Google translation App. But I would love receiving help from French speaking movie viewers. Of course you can use the blue link above and do it example on their web site. But you will not have as much fun and need to translate the French.

Then I read him the riot act from Howard which is:

There are too many losers in each hand. You need all your trumps to ruff your losers in hearts and spades. The four trumps out are @C9654.
