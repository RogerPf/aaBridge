^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A pretty straight forward auction. Mary has a rule of 20 opener. In modern bridge, there are basically no 13 point hands you should pass unless you have enough queens and jacks to subtract 1 using the adjust-3 method. But with 2 quick tricks and only 1 jack and 4 kings, this is a very clear opener. And the rest of the auction was fine, once I changed West's bid from double to 2@D the rest was fine.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|^B@2If there is only 1 unbid major, a takeout double should promise 4 in that major. On rare occasions you may be stuck and have to double with a good 3-card major. But on this hand Judy had a perfectly good 2@D bid. If she had 4 diamonds and a doubleton club, she might try a takeout double, although I might bid 1N with the 15 HCP. |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT|^B@2Basically, if you make a takeout double with 3 cards in the 1 unbid major, all other bids must be worse alternatives. On this hand 2@D is a perfectly reasonable alternative. With a 2nd club and 4 diamonds, 1N and double are both about the same in terms of reasonable bids. I prefer 1N but double is ok too.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT|^B@2Mary has a clear 2@S bid showing 13-16 Bergen Dummy Points and I have a clear pass since we cannot possibly have game with my 8 declarer points (the @DJ is dubious and does not count).|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT|^B@2Judy has no good opening lead. but leading unprotected aces is usually a bad idea, especially with AQ. On this hand because north had the DK it worked out ok.  I don't like a heart or a spade lead. I would choose the @CQ personally. That has risks, but seems the least risky.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT|^B@2After trick 8, Judy should have drawn my last trump with the @SQ and then she could lead a diamond and I end up losing an extra trick. When she led the diamond, at trick 11, when I still had a trump, she let me sluff my club loser from dummy and make the hand. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT|^B@2There are rare occasions where giving declarer a ruff/sluff is the right play, when there is no chance you have tricks in any of the side suits. But those occasions are so rare that if you never give declarer a ruff/sluff you will come out ahead in the long run.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It probably does not matter on this hand. But, I am unlikely to get in again and Judy wants me to lead a spade. So she should play a low club. When my @CQ wins, I know she has the @CA and @CK, but the low club indicates she wants me to switch suits. And obviously she wants spades having bid them. That is an expert play.|

So she should cash 2 clubs then the spade, although it is very likely the spade is cashing as I probably don't have 7 spades.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand I think the bidding was too aggressive. Everything through 2@S was fine, since Mary is willing to play 3@H with the known 9-card fit. What Judy should do is double (stolen bid) rather than bid 3@S—she would bid 2S if Mary had passed.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@S says she would have bid 3@S over 3@H. She is close, as she has a very nice hand. But she does not have a 3 over 3 by my competitive guidelines. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|She does not have a known 9-card fit. I am promising only 5 spades. I might have 6, but if she doubles then I will know to bid 3@S with 6 spades.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, Judy does not have a singleton heart. So by my competitive guidelines (only bid 3 over 3 with 9-card fit or singleton in their suit) Judy does not have a 3@S bid.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1N promises at least 6. Some people thought I should bid 2N, promising 18+, but that is not correct. 2N by South is not forcing. It asks North to bid 3N with a good 8 or more, so 2N shows a good 16 to 18.|
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But I have 19. opposite 6, I am willing to play 3N with 25 HCP min, so that is why I bid 3N not 2N. If I bid 2N Judy should pass.|
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With this hand, obviously, hearts is the best contract, but cannot be bid with standard 2/1.|
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, with limited entries, North has to be very careful. Counting her tricks, she likely has 4 heart tricks (assume she will lose to the HQ), probably 4 club tricks (assuming east has the @C10 based on the lead) and a diamond. That is 9 tricks. So the plan is to play hearts losing the @HQ if need be.|
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When the @HQ comes down she is all set. She now can count 5 hearts, 3 sure clubs, and a diamond. So after playing 3 rounds of hearts, she should play the @DQ. If West takes the Ace, the @DK is the 9th trick.|
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If West ducks, the @DQ is the 9th trick. But the key is trick 1, as it often is. You must come up with a plan. Since your plan involves taking 4 heart tricks, you need an entry to your hearts. The only entry is the @CK. So you have to preserve the @CK for later once the hearts are set up.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That was a good contract, although it turns out 3N is better. But only because Judy cannot get in with a club to lead a diamond through. But, against 4@S, it was easy to lead a club and get a club ruff. Most of the time North/South will make 4@S. Again, I suggest you review my tutorial movie on reverses. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general it is not a good idea to transfer to 3 of a minor, but with 6-4 and at least an 8-card club fit, it is probably better on this hand.|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Many players transfer to 3 of a minor when it is incorrect to do so. You should only do so with either a very weak hand (no more than 4) or 4-6 or so with a singleton or void. Even here it is possible that 1N is better than 3@C.|
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A common practice is to play 2@S as transfer to minors. The notrumper bids 3@C. With clubs responder passes. Otherwise, bids diamonds and notrumper passes. |
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A better but more complicated way is to play 4 way transfers, where 2@S is a club transfer and 2N is a diamond transfer.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That was a rare hand with 3 of a minor played better than 1N. but you should avoid transferring to 3 of a minor even with a 6-card suit most of the time. You should only do so with either an unbalanced hand (with a singleton or void) or with a very weak hand (< 4 HCP).|
PG| ***** 140 ***** |


NT|
^B@2Otherwise 1N will play better most of the time. It is almost always easier to take 7 tricks than 9 tricks. It is somewhat analagous to why you should just about always play 3N rather than 5 of a  minor.|

The bidding is routine. When we show partner we've got six Hearts and 10-12ish points, he happily takes us to game. His dubious @HQ has become a very attractive card. |

The opening lead, from the unbid suit (good choice), appears to be fourth down.|

Our Count and Plan shows four losers, two in Spades and two in Clubs. The good news is that we will be able to ruff at least one of the Clubs in dummy.|

The card we choose to ruff with is the most important card played in this hand. At trick 2, East played the @CJ. He might be playing with our heads, or he might have a doubleton.

We are now going to go for an overtrick by playing another Club to be ruffed, hoping that West has the @HJ. If so, we make five. He doesn't and we don't. East takes the trick with his @HJ, and then attacks the Spades. |lc|c9|
PG| ***** 211 ***** |

We lose our two Spades, and take the rest of the tricks. I want you to notice something. We have to be careful about trying for overtricks. Often we jeopardize our contract by trying, but on this hand, it cost nothing to try. |

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Doesn't it seem a bit weird that after we have shown four hearts in the bidding (via Stayman) that our LHO still led a heart anyway? What could this mean?|
PG| ***** 222 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It means that it is most likely our LHO has led from strength. Something like @HK J 10 7 5 maybe? The @H7 lead wouldn't have been from a shortage or from a bad suit for otherwise that would be a very strange lead. |
PG| ***** 223 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Regardless, how can we confirm that our LHO has led their fourth best?|
PG| ***** 224 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You can check with the Rule of 11. The Rule of 11 only applies on leads that are fourth best and it can be used by the declarer or a defender. |
PG| ***** 225 ***** |


NT|^B@2
By subtracting the rank (@H7 here) from 11, you can work out how many cards are higher than the card led in the remaining three hands. (More will be explained in the post-hand analysis) So which card should you play on this first trick?|
PG| ***** 226 ***** |


NT||lb|*CWhich card should you play from dummy? Click that card on the right.^^hq^hq83|
PC|hqhth2|NT|^B@2
In normal circumstances you would play low because if the @HK is onside you can always play a heart to dummy's @HQ later. But here, we can be pretty sure that our LHO has the @HK. |
PG| ***** 228 ***** |


NT|If the @H7 is to be believed and is the fourth best, it certainly can't be from @HJ 10 9 7 5 (giving our RHO the singleton @HK) because then our LHO would surely have led the @HJ from that holding.|

PG| ***** 231 ***** |


AT| If our LHO has four or five hearts and persists with another heart, we can win with the @HA and take a spade finesse through our LHO. That way, even if our RHO has the @SQ he will have no more hearts to play.|

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Comments:
North opens 2NT (20-22) and South decides to try Stayman with his 4.3.3.3 hand. That's a marginal call (some would prefer a direct raise to 3NT) but it makes no difference as 3NT is the final contract anyway.|
PG| ***** 237 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
As the opening Lead, it is acceptable to lead your opponent's suit if it happens to be your best suit and your suit quality is actually decent. Here, it would be great if your partner had @HA x or even @HQ x so it is reasonable to lead a heart.|
PG| ***** 238 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Had your heart suit been @HK 8 6 4 2, then it is not good enough (lacking intermediate cards) to attempt to try and set up the suit. |
PG| ***** 239 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As declarer, at first you might wonder why your opponent has led into your four-card suit that you've shown on the auction. The only logical reason must be that your opponent has a good suit and wants to set it up. Therefore it is clear that the @H7 is indeed fourth best (as opposed to, say, from x x x or x x x x).|
PG| ***** 240 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The next question is, how can you actually confirm that our LHO has led their fourth best? |
PG| ***** 241 ***** |


AT|You can check with the Rule of 11.|
PG| ***** 242 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The Rule of 11 only applies on leads that are fourth best and it can be used by the declarer or a defender. By subtracting the rank (@H7 here) from 11, you can work out how many cards are higher than the card led in the remaining three hands. |
PG| ***** 243 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So, 11-7 gives 4 so there are four cards higher than the @H7 in the remaining three hands.|
PG| ***** 244 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We have the @HA in our hand, and dummy has the @HQ 8 which are all higher than the @H7. So our RHO must have exactly one card higher than the @H7 - assuming the lead is actually fourth best, of course. |
PG| ***** 245 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Could it be the @HK?|
PG| ***** 246 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That would give the opening leader @HJ 10 9 7 5 which is highly unlikely as the @HJ would have been led. Could it be the @HJ, or @H10, or @H9?|
PG| ***** 247 ***** |


AT| Sure it can. That would give the opening leader @HK 10 9 7 5 or @HK J 9 7 5 or @HK J 10 7 5, respectively.|
PG| ***** 248 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Usually when you encounter this type of situation where you are declaring in a No-Trump contract and your LHO has led a suit where you have Q x x in dummy and A x x in hand, you would play low in case your RHO has a singleton king (since you can play a low one back to dummy later).|
PG| ***** 249 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, if you can work out that the king is almost definitely going to be onside, then you can put up the queen to gain a quick trick.|
PG| ***** 250 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Back to this hand - assuming that dummy's @HQ will win, what next? |
PG| ***** 251 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You will have two spade tricks, two heart tricks, one diamond trick, and three club tricks. You will need one more - but from where? |
PG| ***** 252 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You can simply take a spade finesse and even if it loses, you will have 9 tricks. But there is an even better line. Can you spot it?|
PG| ***** 253 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You should first finesse in diamonds. If our LHO has four or five hearts and persists with another heart, we can win with the @HA and take a spade finesse through our LHO. That way, even if our RHO has the @SQ he will have no more hearts to play. |
PG| ***** 254 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So how does this play gain? Well, on this deal your LHO has @SQ 9 5 and after a successful spade finesse you will have four spade tricks. That's not all.|
PG| ***** 255 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You then cash all of your spades and your clubs (ending in dummy) and watch your LHO's discards. You will see that your LHO will eventually discard the @D6.|
PG| ***** 256 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In the three card ending (in which you will have already taken 9 tricks), you will have @DA J 9 in your hand and @H8 @D10 7 in dummy. Given that your LHO has not discarded a single heart, you then know for 100% sure that your LHO has three remaining hearts in his hand.|
PG| ***** 257 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That means the diamond finesse is now marked and you can take it knowing the finesse is going to work for 100% - giving you 12 tricks. |
PG| ***** 258 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This foresight seems a bit unnecessary because usually at IMPs we don't care about overtricks. However, as declarer it is always a good practice to be able to think up of different line of plays so you can always compare which line is superior.|
PG| ***** 259 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you did take 9 tricks for +400, then there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. If you like to take an extra step and take a diamond finesse at trick 2, you will get 12 tricks for +490. A difference of 90 is still 3 IMPs! |
