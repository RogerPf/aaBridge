^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Anyway, a couple of small points. actually. Lisa has a clear heart lead. you should lead partner's suit just about always. If you don't you either better have a void or a really really good reason not to. And if you are wrong and should have led partner's suit, your partner has the right to be mad at you :).|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also when leading partner's suit, if you have not supported it, you should lead count (low from 3 small) even if you normally leading top of nothing. |
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is almost always more important for partner to know  your count in that case than attitude. Partner can usually work out your holding once she knows your count. This hand was a perfect example. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|To repeat, I would lead a trump on this auction, when dummy has shown spade shortness and Sue has spades. But with her particular trump holding she is almost certain that a trump lead gives up a trump trick, so I would have led a club as she did.|

Hubble realized that this could be expressed with a simple equation, Ho = v/d (where Ho is the constant, v is the recessional velocity of a flying galaxy, and d its distance away from us). Ho has been known ever since as the Hubble constant and the whole formula as Hubble’s Law.|

fp|1|cs|6|at|^-{    HOW OLD IS THE UNIVERSE - Part I   
}^-|fp||cs||ht|c|at|^B@2Using his formula, Hubble calculated that the universe was about two billion years old, which was a little awkward because even by the late 1920s it was fairly obvious that many things within the universe—not least Earth itself—were probably older than that. Refining this figure has been an ongoing preoccupation of cosmology.|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


AT|

Almost the only thing constant about the Hubble constant has been the amount of disagreement over what value to give it. In 1956, astronomers discovered that Cepheid variables were more variable than they had thought; they came in two varieties, not one. This allowed them to rework their calculations and come up with a new age for the universe of from 7 to 20 billion years—not terribly precise, but at least old enough, at last, to embrace the formation of the Earth.|
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


AT|

In the years that followed there erupted a long-running dispute between Allan Sandage, heir to Hubble at Mount Wilson, and Gérard de Vaucouleurs, a French-born astronomer based at the University of Texas. Sandage, after years of careful calculations, arrived at a value for the Hubble constant of 50, giving the universe an age of 20 billion years. De Vaucouleurs was equally certain that the Hubble constant was 100.|
PG| ***** 166 ***** |


AT|

You are of course entitled to wonder what is meant exactly by "a constant of 50" or "a constant of 100." The answer lies in astronomical units of measure. Except conversationally, astronomers don't use light-years. They use a distance called the parsec (a contraction of parallax and second), based on a universal measure called the stellar parallax and equivalent to 3.26 light-years. Really big measures, like the size of a universe, are measured in megaparsecs: a million parsecs. The constant is expressed in terms of kilometers per second per megaparsec. Thus when astronomers refer to a Hubble constant of 50, what they really mean is "50 kilometers per second per megaparsec." For most of us that is of course an utterly meaningless measure, but then with astronomical measures most distances are so huge as to be utterly meaningless.|
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


AT|

This would mean that the universe was only half the size and age that Sandage believed—ten billion years. Matters took a further lurch into uncertainty when in 1994 a team from the Carnegie Observatories in California, using measures from the Hubble space telescope, suggested that the universe could be as little as eight billion years old—an age even they conceded was younger than some of the stars within the universe. |
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


AT|

In February 2003, a team from NASA and the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, using a new, far-reaching type of satellite called the Wilkinson Microwave Anistropy Probe, announced with some confidence that the age of the universe is 13.7 billion years, give or take a hundred million years or so. There matters rest, at least for the moment.|
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The difficulty in making final determinations is that there are often acres of room for interpretation. Imagine standing in a field at night and trying to decide how far away two distant electric lights are. Using fairly straightforward tools of astronomy you can easily enough determine that the bulbs are of equal brightness and that one is, say, 50 percent more distant than the other. But what you can’t be certain of is whether the nearer light is, let us say, a 58-watt bulb that is 122 feet away or a 61-watt light that is 119 feet, 8 inches away. On top of that you must make allowances for distortions caused by variations in the Earth’s atmosphere, by intergalactic dust, contaminating light from foreground stars, and many other factors. The upshot is that your computations are necessarily based on a series of nested assumptions, any of which could be a source of contention. |
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


AT|

There is also the problem that access to telescopes is always at a premium and historically measuring red shifts has been notably costly in telescope time. It could take all night to get a single exposure. In consequence, astronomers have sometimes been compelled (or willing) to base conclusions on notably scanty evidence. In cosmology, as the journalist Geoffrey Carr has suggested, we have "a mountain of theory built on a molehill of evidence. "Or as Martin Rees has put it: "Our present satisfaction [with our state of understanding] may reflect the paucity of the data rather than the excellence of the theory."|
PG| ***** 171 ***** |


AT|

This uncertainty applies, incidentally, to relatively nearby things as much as to the distant edges of the universe. As Donald Goldsmith notes, when astronomers say that the galaxy M87 is 60 million light-years away, what they really mean ("but do not often stress to the general public") is that it is somewhere between 40 million and 90 million light-years away—not quite the same thing. For the universe at large, matters are naturally magnified. Bearing all that in mind, the best bets these days for the age of the universe seem to be fixed on a range of about 12 billion to 13.5 billion years, but we remain a long way from unanimity.|
PG| ***** 172 ***** |


AT|

One interesting recently suggested theory is that the universe is not nearly as big as we thought, that when we peer into the distance some of the galaxies we see may simply be reflections, ghost images created by rebounded light.|
PG| ***** 173 ***** |


AT|

The fact is, there is a great deal, even at quite a fundamental level, that we don’t know—not least what the universe is made of. When scientists calculate the amount of matter needed to hold things together, they always come up desperately short. It appears that at least 90 percent of the universe, and perhaps as much as 99 percent, is composed of Fritz Zwicky’s "dark matter"—stuff that is by its nature invisible to us. It is slightly galling to think that we live in a universe that, for the most part, we can’t even see, but there you are. At least the names for the two main possible culprits are entertaining: they are said to be either WIMPs (for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, which is to say specks of invisible matter left over from the Big Bang) or MACHOs (for MAssive Compact Halo Objects—really just another name for black holes, brown dwarfs, and other very dim stars).|
pg| ***** 174 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Particle physicists have tended to favor the particle explanation of WIMPs, astrophysicists the stellar explanation of MACHOs. For a time MACHOs had the upper hand, but not nearly enough of them were found, so sentiment swung back toward WIMPs but with the problem that no WIMP has ever been found. Because they are weakly interacting, they are (assuming they even exist) very hard to detect. Cosmic rays would cause too much interference. So scientists must go deep underground. One kilometer underground cosmic bombardments would be one millionth what they would be on the surface. But even when all these are added in, "two-thirds of the universe is still missing from the balance sheet," as one commentator has put it. For the moment we might very well call them DUNNOS (for Dark Unknown Nonreflective Nondetectable Objects Somewhere).|
PG| ***** 175 ***** |


AT|

Recent evidence suggests that not only are the galaxies of the universe racing away from us, but that they are doing so at a rate that is accelerating. This is counter to all expectations. It appears that the universe may not only be filled with dark matter, but with dark energy. Scientists sometimes also call it vacuum energy or, more exotically, quintessence. Whatever it is, it seems to be driving an expansion that no one can altogether account for.|
PG| ***** 176 ***** |


AT| 

The theory is that empty space isn’t so empty at all—that there are particles of matter and antimatter popping into existence and popping out again—and that these are pushing the universe outward at an accelerating rate. Improbably enough, the one thing that resolves all this is Einstein’s cosmological constant—the little piece of math he dropped into the general theory of relativity to stop the universe’s presumed expansion, and called "the biggest blunder of my life." It now appears that he may have gotten things right after all.|
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


AT|

The upshot of all this is that we live in a universe whose age we can’t quite compute, surrounded by stars whose distances we don’t altogether know, filled with matter we can’t identify, operating in conformance with physical laws whose properties we don’t truly understand.|
PG| ***** 178 ***** |


AT|

And on that rather unsettling note, let’s return to Planet Earth and consider something that we do understand—though by now you perhaps won’t be surprised to hear that we don’t understand it completely and what we do understand we haven’t understood for long.|

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Textbooks teach us that a take-out Double requires a shortage in the opponent's suit and support for the other three suits - this still holds true in today's day and age, but the revolutionized modern take-out double can also include some extra hand types that you may not expect. |mb|1d|mb|x1h|

^B@2^*BMM: Howard does not agree with the commentary that the double was acceptable. Double of a major should promise 4 cards in the other major. Rarely you are stuck for a bid and have to lie and double with 3 cards in the other major. But almost always, when you do, you have at least one honor and an intermediate (10 or 9). ^*N|

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding: 
I think North's Double of 1@D was perfectly acceptable. Although North doesn't have a shortage in diamonds, the hand does fit the description of "three or more card support in the other suits". |
PG| ***** 221 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It is very important to get into and out of the auction as early as possible.|
PG| ***** 222 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Imagine if North had passed 1@D. The auction would proceed (1@D) - Pass - (1@H) - Pass  -  (1NT) - Pass - (Pass) - Pass? Who is going to be bidding? |
PG| ***** 223 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You might say that you will balance with 2@S because you don't want the opponents to declare in 1NT, but is balancing with 2@S that safe?|
PG| ***** 224 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You have a very balanced hand with soft values, East could potentially have four spades and Double you. |
PG| ***** 225 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This is the reason why it is good to "get into the auction early so you can get out early".|
PG| ***** 226 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Once North passes 1@D, North will feel very guilty for the rest of the auction and it could be too dangerous to come back into the auction later (as the opponents have already exchanged information).|
PG| ***** 227 ***** |


NT|^B@2
By Doubling with such a hand (remember, it still needs to meet the standard pre-requisites of a normal takeout double such as at least 3-3 in both majors etc.) you can expect to find your fit immediately.|
PG| ***** 228 ***** |


NT|^B@2
North's double now allowed you to bid and compete in spades, and you landed in a good contract.|
PG| ***** 229 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This is what the takeout double has revolutionized into because of the need to compete in the auction while it's still safe to do so.|
PG| ***** 230 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Some might even go as far as saying, "it's a bidder's game"!|
PG| ***** 231 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Play: 
We have two diamond losers, a potential heart loser, and two or three spade losers depending on how the spades break. |
PG| ***** 232 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The opponents play three rounds of diamonds in which we ruff and play ... ? We play on the trump suit of course, but which trump? |
PG| ***** 233 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You should exit with a low trump. It is important to maintain trump control so you do not want to play the @SA just yet. If you do and the spades break 4-1, you might find yourself in deep trouble.|
PG| ***** 234 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So you exit with a spade to East's @SJ who now switches to a heart. You win in dummy and play a spade to your ... ? |
PG| ***** 235 ***** |


AT|

Do you think you should finesse in case East started off with @SK Q J 2 ?|
PG| ***** 236 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you think about it carefully, you will realize that it is quite impossible for East to have all of the spade honors. |
PG| ***** 237 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We have a combined total of 21 points between us leaving 19 for the opponents. East has already shown up with the @DA, and if East also has @SK Q J 2, that would leave West to have opened the bidding with 9 points! |
PG| ***** 238 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Therefore, we should play the @SA as West must have at least one spade honor. When West follows suit, you can now play on clubs to discard a losing heart, making an overtrick.|
PG| ***** 239 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It was vital for your partner to have acted over the opponent's 1@D opening as it allowed you to find your fit without needing to guess (which is what will happen if your partner passes over 1@D).|
PG| ***** 240 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If E/W gets to play in 1NT, that will probably go one off for +50 whereas making 9 tricks in 2@S nets us +140. This may not be a very big difference in IMPs, but it is a huge difference in pairs. |

NT|^B@2
The catch is that after two rounds of spades, partner may not switch to diamonds and that may be troubling as declarer might be able to use dummy's clubs for diamond pitches in hand.

So what is the best way to encourage partner to switch to diamonds?|

Play:  Partner's @SA lead will (should) promise the @SK so you can practically see two spade tricks, a trump trick, and a diamond trick. What's the catch? |
PG| ***** 264 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The catch is that after two rounds of spades, partner may not switch to diamonds and that may be troubling as declarer might be able to use dummy's club for diamond pitches in their hand. So how can we make sure that our partner will switch to a diamond? |
PG| ***** 265 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You should play the @S3 at trick one! You do not want to encourage your partner to play three rounds of spades for if that happens, declarer may have strong enough hearts to ruff the spade with the ace, knock out your @HK, and discard diamond losers on dummy's clubs. |
PG| ***** 266 ***** |


NT|^B@2
What you want is a diamond switch BEFORE your @HK is driven out. So after partner cashes two spades, upon seeing you play low-high in spades, he should then shift to the logical suit, diamonds. When that happens, declarer is slated for a one trick set. |
PG| ***** 267 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Partner should be able to work out to switch to a diamond rather than a club because if we actually did have the @CK instead (giving declarer both @DK Q), either that won't be enough diamonds for declarer to pitch his losing clubs, or if it is enough, declarer could just simply win the @CA, unblock the diamonds, cross to dummy with the @HA and cash the @DA for a club discard. |
PG| ***** 268 ***** |


NT|^B@2
P.S. When this hand was played in a tournament with a hand-picked field, none of the defenders in the East chair found the play of a low spade at trick one. Did you?|
