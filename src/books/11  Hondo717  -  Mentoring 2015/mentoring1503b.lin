^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me count our likely tricks in 4@H contract. Probably 6 heart tricks maybe 5, one club for sure, and say one of the 2 kings. So 4 is not likely to make.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On hands where partner has a distributional hand you should do what some call "picture" bidding. Picture likely hands for partner to determine what to bid. Don't count HCP, as they are very inaccurate on distributional hands.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, it is hard for me to picture a likely hand for Judy where she can take 10 tricks. So I am passing. That doesn't mean she won't make 10 tricks. It just means that more often than not she won't. Plus with only 8 trump, I do not like to stretch for game.|mb|p|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some experts would open my hand 1NT. They feel it is ok to open 6-3-2-2 hands 1NT if the 6 card suit is a minor.  |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For those who would open 1NT with 6-3-2-2, most have the restriction that the 3-card suit has to be a major, because with 5-5 in the majors, responder is allowed to assume that there is a guaranteed 8-card fit in one of the majors.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Personally, I prefer to only open 1NT holding at most one doubleton, meaning that the only distributions where I open 1NT are 5-3-3-2, 4-4-3-2, or 4-3-3-3. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The strength of opening 1NT is that it is a very precise bid, and if you start destroying the precision of the 1NT opener by allowing other distributions, you lose some of the accuracy that comes with auctions that start with 1NT. |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, since it is easy for me to rebid 3@C over whatever partner bids, I would open 1@C. But on very rare occasions, where I feel my 6-card minor is not strong enough for a jump rebid to the 3-level, I may open 1NT as a "lesser of evils" bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a hand where I would bid 1@S with Mary's hand not 1@D. After bidding 1@D it will almost be impossible to get across that she has 5 spades. Even, were her spade spots and diamond spots reversed I still bid 1@S.|mb|1S|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well that actually wasn't a bad contract. She could play it with only -1. Basically when you have a 7 card fit with AKQ10, only missing the Jack it is 50% that the jack will be either doubleton or third, and if one of those distributions occurs, 3N makes because Mary takes 6 clubs 2 diamonds and a heart.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Any game that is 50% is ok to be in. As to whether, if it makes a difference if I open 1NT and end up as declarer in 3NT, the answer is no. The opening lead will still be a heart. And declarer will try and set up clubs, and end up losing 3 hearts, |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Despite the fact that we had an 8 card heart fit, 1N was a very reasonable alternative contract which is often the case. The moral of this hand is you should open 1N even with a 5-card major with 15-17  and 5-3-3-2 distribution. |
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The vast majority of the time you will have more accurate or at least as accurate bidding. If you have a 9 card fit (e.g. partner has 4 card support) you will end up in your major anyway. The only issue is when partner has 3-card support. and in those cases NT often works out just as well or better.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1@S makes my hand awesome. It is unclear whether to count Bergen "Declarer" points or "Dummy" points. You might think, "Well Howard is going to be dummy so why not count Dummy Points?"|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But it doesn't quite work that way. The hand that counts "Declarer" points is the hand that has the longer length in trump. As another example, suppose you open 1N and partner bids 2@D transfer and you have 3 or 4 hearts.|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In theory the 1N bidder is going to be "declarer" but, in fact, the 1N bidder is the one shorter in hearts. So the 1N bidder uses "Dummy" points as part of Bergen hand evaluation.|
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|To put it another way, "Dummy Points" really mean "hand with shorter trump points" and "Declarer Points" really mean "hand with longer trump points."|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I am counting Declarer points, as the most likely length partner has in spades is 5.I have 10 HCP, +2 length points, plus 1 quality suit, + 1 for 6 card trumps once we find a fit, plus 1 for outside 4 card suit, and plus 2 for singleton for 17 Declarer Points.|

A hatchling is a young alligator, bird, reptile or fish recently emerged from an egg. The word is relatively new--"hatchling" slipped into common usage in 1900--but the first documented "hatchery" for birds operated under that name in 1880.

nt|^B@2
I see 14 very nice HCP and a 5-card suit. To treat this hand as less than 15-17 is not good valuation. Think of all the lousy 12-counts that are opened these days. When you open 1C and rebid 1NT, partner will expect 12-14. This hand is much closer to 15-17 and deserves to be treated that way. This is not "breaking system" or devious -- it is just proper hand evaluation.|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|If you want to use Bergen Starting Points rather than simple HCP to determine whether or not to open 1NT (or, similarly, to open a 20-21 2NT or to rebid an 18-19 2NT)  that is fine. But I use a slightly different approach. |

^B@2^*BLary Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|I'm guessing you tried the more normal-looking @H6. Why do I recommend the @S10? You should notice several things about the opponents' cards. |
PG| ***** 185 ***** |


NT|^B@2
First, LHO won the @DK at trick 2 and played the @DQ to trick 3. By playing the high one first, and then the lower one, an expert would be trying to tell his partner that he has a spade card.|

NT|^B@2
There are many subtle situations where defenders can give suit-preference. Also, you must observe East's discard of the @S3. What are your opponents' carding methods? |

NT|^B@2
Was that @S3 discouraging (normal attitude)? Was it encouraging (upside-down attitude)? Was it odd-even (odd encourages)?|
PG| ***** 188 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You should know what your opponents' signaling methods are -- it will often help you not only in your line of play, but in your own playing of the spots -- you can often confuse their signaling methods -- more on this later.|
PG| ***** 189 ***** |


NT|^B@2
For now, always presume the opponents are using STANDARD CARDING, unless I tell you otherwise. |
PG| ***** 190 ***** |


NT|^B@2   
In this case, the @S3 was discouraging. This is good -- you hope that West will play a heart when he is done with his diamonds. Why didn't you painlessly shed a heart from your hand on the 4th round of diamonds?|
PG| ***** 191 ***** |


NT|^B@2   
Because, you must be looking ahead. The next round of diamonds will cause you lots of pain. On the fifth (and final) diamond, you won't want to part with a club winner (you're presuming/hoping they split 3-2), and you won't want to reduce to a singleton @HK. |

Let's face it, you were probably always intending to bare your @SA, hoping the opponents wouldn't play a spade.|
PG| ***** 193 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You will eventually come down to @SA @HK7 @CAQ832 as your last 8 cards. However, your tempo and sequence of plays is important.  Your plan should be to bare the spade ace (calmly) on the penultimate |CP|1|AT|^*Htinyurl.com/keelkm7^*N|CP||AT| diamond, and then to throw a heart (calmly) on their last diamond.|

NT|^B@2
Note the word "calmly." On the penultimate diamond, you throw the @S10 calmly -- as opposed to squirming and giving it away that you have bared your ace.  |

On the 5th diamond, you are calmly planning to throw your @H6 (leaving yourself with @HK7) -- it would be highly unethical to squirm before throwing that heart.|

NT|^B@2
If cheating (or coffee-housing, if you will) were allowed, sure, you could suffer on the next diamond and then look like you are baring your @HK. But, in real life, I know you would NEVER do such a sleazy thing! Good ethics are usually rewarded. Let's continue the play.|PC|ST|

By a Passed Hand, partner's 2C is obviously not GF.  In fact it is not forcing at all. It shows at least five clubs and about 10-11 points. I can't imagine any contract/bid other than 3NT. (Since partner couldn't open the bidding, slam is not in the picture.)|

Your contract is quite good. Slam would have been pushy; it would require 2-2 diamonds with the king onside (or 3-1 with @DKxx onside). If clubs run, you'll do quite well. Your line of play is dependent on the results of this trick. You'll put up dummy's @HQ.  If it holds, you're in great shape. You'd love to be in dummy to start the diamonds (the clubs can wait).|

This is not the time for a holdup play. You envision lots of tricks and don't want to give one up unnecessarily. |pc|ha|

Either @H8 or @S10 is acceptable. You have to make another discard next. So, throwing them in the opposite order is the same.|PC|h8s9|

NT||lb|*yShould you continue to run the clubs?^^n|nt|^B@2
At IMPS, sure--that would guarantee the contract. But, at match points it makes more sense to work on the diamonds. Unless West has @DKJx(x), you will be able to take a lot of diamond tricks. You want to start the suit from dummy. Now is the time. If you take any more club winners you squeeze your own hand.|

You might as well go all out. It they are 3-1, it is a complete guess (equal odds) as to which high diamond to play. In case diamonds are 2-2, you might as well make the play that nets you 5 tricks.|PC|DQd7|

The rest are yours. Your aggressive line of play is well rewarded (171.5 match points = 88.4%).  Half the field made only 12 tricks (490) in 3NT. Only 6 pairs reached the poor slam (2 of them in notrump).|
