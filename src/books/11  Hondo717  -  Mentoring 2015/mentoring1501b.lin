FP||ht|b|cp||fp|3|at|^bPEARLs - 52 FACTS OF BRIDGE LIFE By Eddie Kantar (Bonus Tips 53-58—last part) |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/5vo9kx^*N
|fp||CP||va|6|AT|^a@2^*B53^*N. When dummy is expected to have a long strong suit at a suit contract and there are two unbid suits, lead from the stronger. However, if one of the suits is headed by the ace, lead from the other. If the two unbid suits look like: K-J-x-x and K-x-x-x, lead from the K-J-x-x suit. If the two suits are A-J-x-x and Q-x-x-x, lead from the queen suit.

^*B54^*n. If you can see that there are no possible defensive tricks coming from the side suits, give declarer a ruff and a sluff. It often promotes a defensive trump trick.

^*B55^*n. When decarer bids two suits, particularly if the first suit is a major, a 'tentative count' is available. Using that tentative count along with partner's opening lead often allows you to get a complete count on declarer's hand at trick one! Example:|
HT|l|at|Opener ^cResponder|
HT|m|AT|1@H ^c1@S
2@D ^c3@D
3NT ^cPass
|HT|m|AT|^f@2^Z@3Declarer is presumed to have five hearts and four diamonds. If partner's lead (@C2, say) gives you a count in that suit, you will have a count on the hand at trick one!

^a@2^*B56^*n. Defenders take tricks with their lower or lowest equal. If you can take a trick with a jack or the queen, take it with the jack. Taking it with the queen denies the jack and can screw partner up.

^*B57^*n. After partner has described his hand and you know what the final contract should be, bid it! The one who knows, goes! Say partner opens 1NT (15-17) and you have 18 HCP points, balanced. There are least 33 points between the two hands so bid 6NT! If leaping so high scares you, go to a mirror and say 6NT out loud. Do it!

^*B58^*n. Best Bonus tip of all: Don't bid the same values twice. Don't play with someone you don't like. Don't scream at your partner and don't forget to use these tips unless you want to spend the rest of your life struggling to get to first base....AMEN.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think Judy was being way too conservative. You need to overcall either 1@S or 2@S. my choice is 2@S but 1@S is ok.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand I have a clear 1@H bid. However, if I had 2 or 3 more points (e.g. a game forcing hand) with the same distribution and we played 2@C after 1@D is a game force (which I prefer not to play, but many people do play it game force) I should bid 2@C.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In fact even if I didn't play 2@C over 1@D a game force, but I had a game forcing hand with clubs and a 4-card major, 2@C is the right bid, You can always show your major later.|sk|w|mb|x|

sk|e|NT||lb|*mWhat are the choices for East?^Redouble~2S~Punt~Bid 2H~Bid 2N^2|sb|S|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@S shows a limit raise or better in spades. It is important that you play that. That means Mary can bid 3@S with a weakish hand and 4 spades as a preemptive bid.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once there is the double (which is essentially a "stolen bid" double) Judy has 2 more bids available. If Faye had not doubled, Judy would have to make some bid. But once Faye doubles, that brings 2 more bids into the picture, pass and redouble. So you have to decide what pass vs 2@S and vs redouble means.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I recommend with a weak hand, you bid 2@S. that is the weakest call you can make. That is the call I recommend Judy makes. Her hand got much better once Mary raised, but it is still pretty weak. She has 6 HCP, 2 length points to start with. Then she can add 2 for the singleton and 1 for the 4 card heart side suit, to get to 11, but it's still a pretty weak hand. |
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, 2@S says "partner I have a weakish overcall" which is what she has. With weaker hands, you want to tell partner immediately plus take up extra bidding room. The redouble would basically be a game force. Judy can make that bid with much stronger hand than she has now.|mb|2S|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


sk|s|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@C and 3@D are possible bids for me. But both of those have flaws, so I will reluctantly pass (I always pass reluctantly :) :).|mb|p|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That was a fairly normal result. An expert defender might overtake my @DJ with the @DK, and play the @HK and another heart, hoping for a ruff. But with spades 2-2, assuming Judy ruffs the 4th heart high, she still takes 9 tricks. 6 spades, 1 heart ruff and 2 clubs.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|All players were too conservative on that hand. Anytime you have a nice 6-card suit and even 7 or 8 points, you should bid your suit. And Judy should make a negative double, although with only 6 HCP pass is an option, if a bit conservative. And I had the option of bidding 2@H over 2@D which would be reasonable.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason I did not was more tactical. 2@H is a perfectly good bid but it makes it easier for Faye to bid 2@S. Once I bid 3@D, I make it harder for Faye to bid again.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, with her hand, she has a 3@S bid. She has a really nice hand and can survive even if pard has a singleton spade. As a general rule, you can assume partner never has a void in your suit. Voids are very rare, so you can assume partner always has at least a singleton.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this particular hand, even if Judy has a void, it is likely that Faye only has 2 spade losers and 4 spade winners. So although it is dangerous to bid at the 3-level vul when partner has not shown anything Faye has the rare hand where a 3@S bid is justified. Remember, it is better to err on the aggressive side than passing. As it is, 4@S is a very good contract, and you can even make 5 if you have to.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Against good defense, we lose 1 spade, 1 heart, 2 diamonds and 1 club for down 1. But -50 is better than -170. Although in IMPs passing 3@D would probably only be a 1 or 2 imp loss so no big deal assuming they beat 3@D.|

^-|fp||ht|e|at|^B@2
A well-known scientist (some say it was Bertrand Russell) once gave a public lecture on astronomy. He described how the earth orbits around the sun and how the sun, in turn, orbits around the center of a vast collection of stars called our galaxy. At the end of the lecture, a little old lady at the back of the room got up and said: “What you have told us is rubbish. The world is really a flat plate supported on the back of a giant tortoise.” The scientist gave a superior smile before replying, “What is the tortoise standing on.” “You’re very clever, young man, very clever,” said the old lady. “But it’s turtles all the way down!”

From: stephen_hawking_a_brief_history_of_time

The rumor has it that the old lady was a "^*BDimweddie^*N" whose offsprings recently have been causing trouble in BBO.

It takes up no bidding room and can mislead partner. Just use the rule of 20 when deciding whether or not to open at the 1 level. Had your suit been anything but clubs, even with a 5-4-3-1 hand, if you wanted to open a weak 2 with a 5-card suit in 3rd seat, that would be fine.|

With a doubleton honor, it is often right to cover an honor with an honor, and had Judy done so, we get a club trick. But I forgive Judy because I liked her smooth 2nd hand low, which will almost always be right.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|They could end up losing 1 heart, 1 diamond and 2 spades because the normal way to play spades is to lead low to the ace, and low to the @QJ.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Judy, what do you think 2@S means. 2@S is a jump shift (which is what you did) has 1 of 2 meanings. It is either weak (showing 0-4 points and 6+ card suit), which is what most play these days.|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


ub||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Or it is very strong, showing 18+ and slam interest. You have a simple 1@S bid, which is forcing.|mb|1S|

NT|^B@2
rattray:  Then how do I show my hand.|
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me explain why 2@S has some merit. Let us count Judy's Bergen Points. She has 13 HCP, plus 3 length points, +1 quality suit point is 17. |
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So she is close too a 2@S bid which shows 18+. Further, she basically has what Bergen calls a "self-fit" in spades, meaning regardless of how many spades I have, spades is a good trump suit. Which means she can add 1 for her 2+ doubletons and get to 18.|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if you play strong jump shifts, 2@S would not be totally unreasonable with Judy's hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well done Judy once you started drawing trump :). Just like a few hands ago, when Faye had a self sufficient suit, it is ok to force a self sufficient suit to be trump. In fact is usually a good idea. |
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A self sufficient suit is a suit that has no more than 2 losers even if partner has a singleton On this hand, where Judy has a 1 loser suit he should always play in spades.|
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the hand where Faye had KJ109xx of spades, that is a 2 loser suit even opposite a singleton. So it is fine for Faye to insist on spades as trump.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As I said, had Mary led a heart either on opening lead the hand does go down. But a singleton heart on this auction is very risky because Mary has no immediate trump winners and I have bid hearts. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is usually not a good idea to lead a suit the opps have bid: although on this hand it happens to work out well. Further, E/W would go down on a diamond lead.|

qx|A8|cs|6|fp|3|ht|b|at|^-{    What Is the Difference Between i.e. and e.g.?    }
^-|fp||ht|d|at|^B@2They may be small, but their power to befuddle writers and speakers of the English language is mighty: what’s the difference between i.e. and e.g.? And what are the correct uses of these commonly confused abbreviations?

The term i.e. is a shortening of the Latin expression id est, which translates to “that is.” It is used to introduce a rephrasing or elaboration on something that has already been stated: “I like citrus fruits, i.e., the juicy, edible fruits with leathery, aromatic rinds of any of numerous tropical, usually thorny shrubs or trees of the genus Citrus.” In this example, i.e. introduces an elaboration on citrus fruits.

The term e.g. is an abbreviation of the Latin expression exempli gratia, meaning “for the sake of example” or more colloquially, “for example.” It follows that this term is used to introduce examples of something that has already been stated: “I like citrus fruits, e.g., oranges, lemons, and limes.”

One easy way to remember the difference between these two is by employing a simple mnemonic device: think of the i at the beginning of i.e. as standing for the first word in the phrase “in other words,” indicating that the clause that follows will rephrase or explain what precedes the term.  E.g. is a little more straightforward since e stands for exempli meaning “example.” To ensure your mastery over these terms is not tarnished by misplaced punctuation, remember that in formal writing, e.g. and i.e. are often set off in parentheses and followed by a comma; in less formal writing, it is standard to place a comma before and after these terms.
