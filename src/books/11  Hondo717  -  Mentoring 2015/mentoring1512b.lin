^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It doesn't really matter on this hand, but a common good declarer play technique is as follows:
If there is one high trump out, there is no need to draw it unless it is a nuisance that will get in the way of your playing the rest of the hand. In this hand, there is no reason for me to draw it—@DA, so I will leave it out.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's count Margaret's Bergen points. One thing that is not obvious, but what she should do on this hand is count "declarer" points rather than "dummy" points. You should count "declarer" points if you are the hand with longer trump. Normally whoever bids a suit first has the longer suit and that is why Marty calls them "declarer" points. But occasionally, the partner of whoever mentions the suit first has the longer suit.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As part of Bergen hand evaluation, once you find a fit, one person counts declarer points and the other person counts dummy points. There are slightly different addons to your Bergen Starting points. In particular, dummy adds for shortness only. |
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Dummy adds 1 point for each doubleton, 2 points for a singleton with 3-card support or 3 points for a singleton with 4+ card support. And for a void adds the number of trump as extra points. So if dummy had 3-card support they would add 3 if they had a void. The reason dummy adds for shortness is the assumption is that the short suit will generate extra trump tricks.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One important concept that many people don't realize is that, when the short hand trumps, that generates extra trump tricks. But when the long hand trumps, it does not generate extra trump tricks. For example, take a look at this hand. We have 5 diamond tricks based on North's length. However, assume my hand was slightly different and I had a doubleton heart. If I could trump a heart in my hand, that would generate a 6th diamond trick.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, trumping spades or clubs in the North hand does not generate any more than the 5 trump tricks North started with. That is why shortness in the hand with short trump is more valuable; it generates extra tricks. Shortness in the long hand also has some value in that it prevents the defense from taking extra tricks. |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, we can only take 2 club tricks since North has a doubleton. Shortness does have some value, but it does not generate extra trick, just provides a means to prevent the defense from scoring tricks.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Declarer points are a bit more complicated. A better but more awkward name for "declarer" points, would be "player with the longer trump" points. And for "dummy" points it would similarly be "player with the shorter trump" points. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The most common time when the player who will be dummy counts "declarer" points is in transfer auctions when partner opens 1NT. In that case, responder, with a 5-card major, always has the longer trump, but because they are doing a transfer, end up being dummy.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And the correct card from the east hand is the @HQ. Defense is very hard. It is crucial that you give your side the best chance to defend correctly by carding correctly. West needs to lead count in partner's suit and East needs to play third hand lowest of touching honors.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If West leads the @HJ, East should assume West has a doubleton (or singleton) and that would, on some hands, cause East to misdefend. Similarly, if East plays the @HK, that denies the @HQ and West should assume South holds the @HQ which again, might cause a misdefense.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Turns out we are making 6, but I would not want to be there. It needs a 3-2 spade break. That is normally 68% but after a preempt the odds are actually less because the preempter is more likely to have a singleton.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also I need a 3-3 diamond break or a doubleton J. The odds for that are normally 50% (40% for 3-3 break and 10% for 4-2 break with doubleton jack). But again they are less with a preempt. Even if we used straight percentages, not taking the preempt into account the odds of a slam making would be 50% of 68% which is 34%. |

mcannon:  If East had passed, would you have opened 2@C?|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The rule for opening 2@C is that you can count 9 tricks, and have 4 quick tricks. I do have 4 quick tricks (@SAK, @HA, @CA), but I only have 8 tricks (6 spades and 2 aces). Therefore, absent 3@H by East, I do not have 2@C opener. The way I would bid the hand is open 1@S, and jump to 4@S over 1NT which is what pard would bid most often. If partner made some 2/1 bid, like 2@C, I would then jump to 3@S to set trump and ask partner to bid controls.|

mb|5H|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Margaret's bid is theoretically correct given her short spades, but it is very possible (not on this hand) that we can't make 4@S and they can't make 5@H. That is why I bid 4@S. It puts pressure on your opponents as to what to do.|

mcannon:  Should I dbl instead of bidding?|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, on this hand, with a singleton spade, particularly vul against not, you should bid 5@H as you did. That is the bid likely to work out best in the long run, but you should be worried that neither 4@S nor 5@H is making. |
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand that is not true, but on some hands it would be. The main criteria in deciding whether or not to bid "5 over 4" is your length in the opponents suit. With a void it is almost always right too bid 5 over 4. With a singleton it is right more often than not. With a doubleton it is wrong to bid 5 over 4 more often than not.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The best way for Margaret to play the hand is to realize that her only entries to dummy are in trump and she needs to take lots of minor suit finesses. So she should play a heart honor from her hand and overtake with the @HA. Take the Diamond finesse. If that wins, she is home free, as she only loses 1 club trick at most. |
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Then when the diamond finesse wins, she plays the @H7 over to the H8 and takes another diamond finesse. When that wins, she can hope for her 4th diamond to set up (it doesn't on this hand). but if it did, she can then pitch a club, lead her @H9 to the @H10 and take the club finesse and make 6.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand she makes 5 so long as the diamond finesse works, or her 4th diamond sets up, allowing her to pitch a club, and then the club finesse works. The way she played it, if I did not have the doubleton @DK she would have gone down even if the diamond finesse works because she did not have the entries to take 2 diamond finesses. It is hard to plan the hand out, but what I said is how an expert would play the hand to give themselves the most ## of chances.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Someone asked me if Margaret should double rather than bidding 2@H. She certainly has a good enough heart suit, and is good enough to double and correct. Doubling and correcting would be correct had she chosen to do it and it might even work out best. However, the argument for bidding 2@H is that, if partner raises, she has an easy 4@H bid. And 4@H rates to be the most likely game her side can make. |
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are some hands where doubling and correcting might work better. However, modern bidding theory tends to favor overcalls to doubling and correcting when either is possible.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The double gives Carol some additional options. She can now pass or redouble. Experts play something that is counter intuitive. The redouble shows a very weak hand, no aces or kings. Pass shows a hand with at least one ace or king and 2@D is actually natural. Remember, once North doubles, artificial 2@D is no longer needed.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding: North does have 13 HCP. The HCP themselves, other than Qxx of diamonds, are pretty nice. But flat hands tend to look better than they are. So I would say she has a bad 13. In fact, if you want to deduct 1 point any time you hold 4-3-3-3 distribution, that would be fine.|
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My double only promises 4 hearts. Normally in order to bid 2@H north should almost always have 4. There are some hands where I might bid 3@H with @HKQx if I had some nice distribution. Those are the same hands where I would raise 1@H to 2@H with 3-card support and no interference. KQx is as good as it gets with 3-card support. However, in order to raise a possible 4-card suit with only 3 card support, you need some better distribution.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, change your hand to @Sx @HKQx @DQxxx @CAQxxx and if the auction went 1@C-P-1@H-p-? that is a nice 2@H bid even with only 3 card support. Basically think of my negative double as a 1@H bid, and make the same bid you would have made over 1@H.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Although 3@C over 2@C is a reasonable bid, it has some downside in that it takes up a lot of bidding room. In general, you should almost always bid 2@D over 2@C, to keep the bidding lower and let the 2@C opener describe their hand at a low level. With a nice major suit (5+ cards and a 3 honors) it is ok to bid 2 of your major over 2@C. |
PG| ***** 143 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|2@H is almost always a good bid as it still keeps the bidding low enough to allow the 2@C bidder to describe their hand at a low level. 2@S is good but slightly worse when the 2@C bidder has a heart suit because they now have to bid 3@H which leaves less room to explore. |
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|A 3@C or 3@D bid by responder should be avoided unless they have a very good suit. This hand barely qualifies as a 3@C bid, but I would not hate a 2@D bid by responder rather than 3@C. This could work out well if the 2@C opener happens to rebid 3@H or even 3N.|

NT|^B@2
We have one Spade, one Diamond, and one Club loser. The opening lead has revealed the worst possible lie (lay?) of Diamonds, too. We could toss all our losers on the Clubs if They had led any suit other than Diamonds. We can't avoid the Club loser, so we've got to find a way to trump or dump our other losers. What options do we have?|
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We are going to have to hang our future on a finesse. If we get to dummy and finesse a Spade at trick three, we can get rid of dummy's other Diamond on a winning Spade in hand. We'll have to preserve trumps in dummy until after we promote the Clubs. This will be tricky, but we've got our plan. Ready?|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding is a straightforward 2@C sequence. Partner certainly has the tickets to make a positive response, and once he gives Heart support also, we make our slam try, settling for 6@H. |
PG| ***** 171 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The opening lead makes our life a little tougher than it needs to be. Good for Them and bad for us. We've got one Spade loser, two Diamonds (one of which we can ruff in dummy) and a sure Club loser. |
PG| ***** 172 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Notice how the lead of any other suit allows us to immediately set up the Clubs, using them as a place to dump all our assorted losers. But we're going to have to be creative. |
PG| ***** 173 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We have no choice but to try for a Spade finesse. Don't you hate it when your slam depends on the location of a Queen?|
PG| ***** 174 ***** |


NT|^B@2
At trick 2 we head for dummy and pull a round of trumps while we're at it. Then with a deep breath and a prayer, at trick 3 we try the Spade finesse. Our Karma is good and the finesse works. We're able to dump dummy's last Diamond on a Spade.|
PG| ***** 175 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Our next challenge is to promote the Clubs before pulling trumps. Why? Because when they take their @CA, they will surely come back in a Diamond and we must have trumps in dummy to ruff with. |
PG| ***** 176 ***** |


NT|^B@2
From then on, it's clear sailing. We dump our last Diamond on dummy's @CQ, and the rest are ours. This line of play takes careful thought. If you try to promote the Clubs first, you are going down. Deservedly. No sympathy here, folks.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|There is not one chance in a thousand that West holds the @HA. No-one would underlead an Ace against a suit contract, particularly when holding an A Q combination. Which card will you play from dummy?|
PG| ***** 187 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Since you know that East holds the @HA, it would be a waste of time to try the @HK from dummy, on this round or the next. Occasionally East will hold a singleton or doubleton @HA and it will appear on the first two rounds, setting up dummy's @HK.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|The defenders score the first three tricks in Hearts and East switches to a Club. If you win with the @CK in your hand, there will be no way to enter dummy to take one of the finesses you need. You therefore overtake with the @CA. |
PG| ***** 201 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The best chance of picking up the spades is to lead a low card, hoping that East holds a doubleton @SK. If you mistakenly lead the @SQ, East will cover with the @SK. You can win with the @SA and play the @SJ, but will then lose the third round of the suit.|
PG| ***** 202 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You finesse the @SJ successfully, cash the @SA and return to dummy with the @SQ. You then lead the @DQ and pick up four Diamond tricks for the contract.|
