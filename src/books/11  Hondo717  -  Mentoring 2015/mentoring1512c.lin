^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a very non-obvious and unclear play which would be to lead a heart, giving me a ruff/sluff. I doubt I would find it either, but there are very rare occasions where that turns out to be a good play. Let us for the sake of teaching it, lead a heart and watch what happens. It sets up a trump trick for Dave.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's talk about the rare instance when giving a ruff/sluff to declarer works out. Basically if you are sure you have no side suit winners (which was not clear on this hand, although presumably Georges did not have the @SK). Then a ruff/sluff either makes no difference, because declarer can only pitch winners or it might set up a trump trick, which it did in this case.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now should Dave know that Georges has no spade tricks. He should if Georges carded correctly. Even if you lead A from AK on opening lead, when you have AK in the middle of the hand, you should lead the King. So when Georges led the @SA he was presumably denying the king. |
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore Dave might be able to work out, since I should have the @SK and the @SQ is on the board, that a ruff/sluff is ok, because I have no losers I can throw. Not easy. but I thought it was interesting to show that. The opportunity to do that comes up once a year :).|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to whether or not Jo An should bid 3@D. It is not clear, but certainly not completely unreasonable. Perhaps I should not have balanced, particularly since my club king is suspect. When I balance (meaning  bid after 2 passes), I am bidding on the combined resources of the 2 hands. And therefore, 3@D bid was a bit stretching it.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Jo An does have a hand that is not as good as it looks. I am not saying 3@D was completely unreasonable, but 4-3-3-3 hands are very bad distribution and must be downgraded.|

Wayne_LV:  Would you consider making a takeout double over 1@C with North hand and 2 passes?|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, if it went 1@C-P-P, a takeout double would not be unreasonable, but I might bid 1N, which in balancing seat shows 11-14, not 15-18 as it does in direct seat.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding: 3@C is fine, with a void even 4@C is not outrageous. With such a nice club suit Georges has what Marty Bergen calls the "perfect preempt." No aces, no honors outside his suit (Jacks are not considered honors for the purposes of preempts), and a singleton or void.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@h is fine. Personally I would bid 4@H with the East hand.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Why did I bid 4@S instead of raising clubs? In general, once partner preempts, you almost always want to play in their suit because their hand may be worth very little to nothing in another suit. But there are 2 reasons why I felt 4@S was the best bid.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One reason is because of my singleton heart. Since I was the one short in hearts, I needed trump length to ruff out hearts. And with only 2 clubs, including the ace which might be useful in drawing them, I might not have enough trump to ruff out all the hearts. |
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other reason is that 10 tricks is almost always easier to make than 11, and I had a self sufficient spade suit. A self sufficient suit is a suit that has at most one loser opposite a singleton. |
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is rare that a hand has a void, so you are allowed to assume partner has a singleton in your suit at least (although in this case that assumption is incorrect). And opposite a singleton, I have a one loser suit. Even opposite a void it is likely to only have 1 loser.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The play: A heart back by Dave was ok, Jo An certainly could have had a singleton. But it turns out if he leads a diamond, I go down losing at least 1 diamond, 1 spade, a diamond ruff, maybe 2, and a heart.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Dave had some inkling that the heart could be a doubleton, since the @H3 is still missing. Had Jo An led the @H3, it obviously would be a singleton. However, the 6 is unclear. You could say, well I played the @H7 so Jo An must have the @H3. |
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But an expert declarer would also throw the @H7 from @H73 just to make it unclear who has the 3 because presumably if I had 2, Dave might have 7, and Jo An might have a singleton.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I would want to hide the 3 from Dave. Not something I am saying the kibs should know to do, but playing the @H7 from @H73 is a standard expert play.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We discussed the bidding. The play is pretty straight forward if you count your tricks. Normally declarer can count 1 spade, 2 hearts, 5 diamonds (if diamonds are 3-2) and 2 clubs. That's 10 tricks. But even if diamonds don't break, 9 tricks are there as on this hand. |

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|With no fast losers to be seen, you do have a potential loser in Spades as well as Diamonds. If Diamonds are 3-3, then your fourth Diamond will become a winner. If Diamonds are 4-2, you'd then need to ruff one in dummy, but there's a danger that an opponent might be able to ruff the third round of Diamonds. |
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So what's the best way to play the trumps so that we have a chance to ruff a Diamond in dummy (if it comes to it)?|
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


AT|

Remember, we just need to tackle the trump suit successfully. If they split 2-2 or 3-1, then the hand is easy. You draw trumps, and thereafter ruff a Diamond in dummy. |
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


NT|^B@2
What you need to deal with, therefore, is if trumps break 4-0! Yes, that would be unlucky, but not impossible. What can you do if West has all four trumps?|
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If West has all four trumps, then your slam is pretty much doomed. If East has all four trumps, however, we might be able to play in such a way to counteract it...|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|Despite the bad trump break, we are now in control of the hand. You can easily cash the top two trumps, and then cash the Diamonds to ruff the fourth one in dummy.|
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
It doesn't matter how the Diamonds break, because East is free to ruff in at any time he wants - if he does, dummy will still have that lone trump available for the Diamond ruff. The only trick lost: A trump trick.|

^B@2^*David Bird: ^*N|cp||at|Spades are agreed as trumps and South suggests a slam by cue-bidding his Ace of Clubs. When North shows the Ace of Hearts, South leaps to 6@S. How will you play this contract when West leads the King of Clubs?|
PG| ***** 176 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Suppose you win with the Ace and test the trump position by cashing the Ace. You will go down! You can restrict your trump losers to one by leading trumps twice from the dummy thereafter, but you will lose a Diamond trick as well.|
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The required safety play is to lead the first round of trumps from dummy, intending to finesse the ten. After winning the first trick, you cross to dummy with a Heart and lead a trump. Suppose East plays low and a finesse of the trump ten wins, West showing out. |
PG| ***** 178 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You will simply cash two more top trumps and turn to the Diamond suit. East is welcome to ruff any Diamond with his master trump since you can then ruff your Diamond loser in dummy. If instead East splits his trump honours, you will win and return to dummy to finesse the trump ten. Again you can ruff your Diamond loser and will make the slam. |

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding. The opening bid of 1@H is obvious on the South cards and North depresses us with a 1NT response. As we can show Diamonds comfortably (because they rank below Hearts) we rebid 2@D, offering North a choice between the red suits. Partner prefers Diamonds to Hearts and says so by Passing, leaving us in 2@D.|
PG| ***** 214 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Play. When dummy appears we can see that 2@D is our best spot (it is a 4-4 fit, after all) although the trumps are very ropey. On this type of hand we figure to try and make as many tricks as we can by ruffing – we are going to get nowhere fast by drawing trumps.|
PG| ***** 215 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So we take the @SA, perforce, and cash the @HA K. Now we ruff a Heart on table, ruff a Spade and try another Heart. Shaking his head, West ruffs in front of dummy with the @D10 and plays a Club.|
PG| ***** 216 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We take the @CA, ruff another Spade to hand and – for want of anything better to do, play the last Heart, throwing yet another Club. East ruffs that, cashes a Club and plays a trump but you have just enough battery life to claim eight tricks.|
