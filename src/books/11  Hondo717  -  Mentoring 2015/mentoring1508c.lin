^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This was a good example of why Shirley should pass. If we end up in NT, it is likely we will get the club suit wrong, and go down on a heart lead. The  bottom line is, don't rescue partner when there is a misfit. Stop quickly before you get too high and get doubled.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I play new suits by "advancer" (which is what we call the partner of the overcaller) as forcing after an overcall, just like new suits by responder are forcing. That is what I think is the best style. But some experts play it as non-forcing. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|They play a cue bid as the only forcing bid that does not necessarily show a limit raise. But then you lose the ability to a) show a limit raise and b) show a good hand.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |

TwstofLime:  Would you alert cue bid here?|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Cue bids are officially not alerted (although I think they should be). However, on BBO I think you should alert everything. Unlike live bridge, where your partner can hear your alert, on BBO he can't see it. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So there is no danger of what is called "unauthorized information" whereby your alert tells partner something they may not know. Therefore, on BBO I recommend you alert everything you think is mildly alertable. Even in live bridge I tend to over alert. I think it is the most ethical way to play.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us discuss the auction. Admittedly if I let Sandy defend as she wished Shirley would not be down as many and we got a bad break. Further, 4@H is not that great a contract.|

ladydoc: 3N probably is my best spot.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The problem is my 1@S bid can be made on as little as 8 points. So although I think 2@H is a reasonable call by Shirley over 3@H I am not sure she should bid 4@H. I would probably bid 4@H with as little as 11 points.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |

ladydoc: How about you bid 3 clubs and ask me if I have a club stopper?|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Shirley is correct. 3@C by me would be asking about a club stopper since Sandy opened 1@C. On the other hand, after my 3@H bid Shirley could directly bid 3N as she has the clubs stopped and does not need me to ask.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Saying that, on this hand, I think the best bid by me is 3@H. And I think either 3N or 4@H by Shirley has merit. So does pass.|

ladydoc: And is pass by me first choice?|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is unclear what the best bid is. I guess, after thinking about it, I like 3N as it is 1 trick less. Not sure how 3N does but it has some plays. We take 3 spades 2 clubs 2 diamonds and a heart for sure for 8 tricks and might be able to eke out another trick somewhere.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I like 2@C best with sandy's hand. I strain to bid 2@C over 1@D as it makes it much harder for the opps to find a major suit fit. But a double would not be totally unreasonable either. I would bid 2@C personally but would not fault anyone who doubled.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because of lack for 4-3 majors and the fact that 2@C makes it harder for us to find a major suit fit. If  4-3 then double better. I am not happy as doubler with 3-3 in the majors but Sandy does have 2 honors in each major so it has some merit if you chose to double.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Sandy did a good job playing the hand with a bad trumps distribution. When you can see the for hand and play it double dummy, of course, it is easy to find an endplay in trumps at trick 4.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We did very well by my passing. That is often the case when you are long in their suit and short in pard's suit. It is sort of the mirror image reasoning of why you should bid when you have support for partner and shortness in the opps suit. When you have length in the opps suit and shortness in pard's suit, you should strain to defend.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And now let me answer, "What logic North used to issue the double?"|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Whenever you open and there is an overcall followed by 2 passes, one thing opener has to think about is whether or not his partner might have a hand where he wants to make a penalty double. Since a double after the overcall is negative, it is not possible for partner to directly make a penalty double. |
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So when opener is short in the overcalled suit, he should strain to reopen with a double, allowing responder to pass if he had a hand where he wanted to make a penalty double but could not. It does not matter how many points opener has. It just matters if opener is short in the overcalled suit (a singleton is best, but a doubleton is acceptable). |
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The double is for takeout, but responder can pass with length in the overcalled suit. That is why Faye needed to reopen with a double, to protect when I have a good hand and want to penalize the overcall.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On my passing the double, on this particular hand, I did not have a clear action over the double, I did have length in clubs, but I did not have much defense other than that. However, I decided pass was my best option, converting Faye's takeout double to a penalty double.|

Pluto mission has stunned the world
How NASA nearly missed the trip to Pluto}
^-|fp||ht|g|AT|^B@2NASA and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland had to overcome several monumental obstacles to get the project which stunned the world off the ground. The troubles did not even stop after the lift off. However, the women and the men in charge of the New Horizons project managed to overcome all and the rendezvous with Pluto in July 14, 2015 is now considered as a triumph of human ingenuity. Without this resounding success we still had to be content with Pluto as just a hazy dot of light for another 248 years.|
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


AT|

The New Horizons had to overcome, reluctance of NASA officials to send a spacecraft to Pluto to begin with, budgetary restrictions or cancellation, shortage of plutonium available to power the spacecraft and a rigid deadline set by the clockwork of the planets to name a few. |
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


AT|

First let us look at what went on for the project to get funded. In 2000, the mission was almost cancelled for good. S. Alan Stern, New Horizons’ principal investigator said, "the associate administrator at the time, Ed Weiler, held a news conference and said: 'We are out of the Pluto business. It's over. It's dead. It's dead. It's dead.' He repeated himself three times."|
PG| ***** 104 ***** |

It was a heart breaking setback for many planetary scientists and Pluto fans, especially as it seemed to be a case of then or 248 years later. In 1989, Pluto had reached the closest point of its orbit to the sun and was on the outbound trek, turning colder. Scientists worried that Pluto's tenuous atmosphere would turn to ice and fall to its surface, making Pluto a much less interesting place to study until it neared the sun again—over two centuries later—when all of us would be long gone.|

Johannes Kepler, working with data painstakingly collected by Tycho Brahe without the aid of a telescope, developed three laws which described the motion of the planets across the sky.|
PG| ***** 109 ***** |

^b@21. The Law of Orbits: All planets move in elliptical orbits, with the sun at one focus.

^b@22. The Law of Areas: A line that connects a planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times.

^b@23. The Law of Periods: The square of the period of any planet is proportional to the cube of the semi major axis of its orbit.

Kepler's laws were derived for orbits around the sun, but they apply to satellite orbits as well.|

At its most distant, when Earth and Pluto are on the opposite sides of the sun from one another, Pluto lies 4.67 billion miles (7.5 billion kilometers) from Earth. At their closest, the two are only 2.66 billion miles (4.28 billion km) apart. Further, after the sun formed, the remaining dust and gas evolved into the planets that make up our solar system. This means that most of them orbit on a nearly flat plane in relation to one another. But after its formation, Pluto wound up out of sync, its orbit tipped to an angle of about 17 degrees in relation to this plane.|

But dwarf planet’s Pluto’s orbit is very different. It’s highly elliptical, traveling around the Sun in a squashed circle. And Pluto’s orbit is highly inclined, traveling at an angle of 17-degrees. This strange orbit gives Pluto some unusual characteristics, sometimes bringing it within the orbit of Neptune.|

This means that it doesn’t orbit within the same plane as the rest of the Solar System. Instead, Pluto orbits at an angle of 17-degrees. For part of its orbit, Pluto is above the plane of the ecliptic (where the other planets orbit) and other times it’s below that plane. Its highly elliptical orbit means that the atmosphere of the dwarf planet changes over time, expanding and contracting as its components freeze and melt. Astronomers call this orbit eccentric because Pluto follows an orbit that traces out an elongated ellipse around the Sun.|

When scientists send probes to planets and other bodies, the spacecraft rarely travel in straight lines. Visiting the more distant parts of our solar system, the satellites often use the gravity of moons, planets, and even the sun to provide them with fuel-less acceleration. The constant motion of the solar system means that the bodies aren't always in the most ideal position at the time of launch — and with bodies such as Pluto, waiting for the ideal lineup could mean a delay of decades or even centuries. As such, it sometimes takes longer to travel to a distant body with faster rockets than it may have decades ago, simply because one journey may utilize a straighter line.|

This spacecraft was the fastest spacecraft ever to leave Earth to explore Pluto, the last planet of any type in our Solar System proper.

The most distant-traveling spacecraft in the solar system, the Voyager and Pioneer missions, never made it to the tiny body. Thus, NASA's New Horizons mission is the only spacecraft to visit Pluto. New Horizons passed by Mars, and used Jupiter for a gravity assist on its way to Pluto.|

The quickest way to Pluto is to take a left turn at Jupiter, using the giant planet's gravity for acceleration, which cuts the travel time by four years. But a launch after January 2006 would mean Jupiter would be too far out of alignment to provide a boost. NASA had a very small window for launch.|

After many years of vacillation, Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland got the go ahead from NASA with the preliminary work for the mission in the fall of 2001. To meet the rigid deadline set by the planetary laws, they started a 4-year, two-month fast track work to design, build and test the spacecraft and get it to the launching pad as early as January 2006. But, soon after, the funding problems began. Finally Congress, persuaded by senator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, inserted earmarks in the spending bills to keep the Pluto mission on track.|

The New Horizons mission to Pluto was possible only because of the radionuclide Pu-238 that generates continuous power out where solar energy is too weak, chemical energy is too heavy, and batteries and fuel cells are too short-lived to be of use. The figure on the left shows the different power sources for various levels of power and time-scales over which the power is needed. |

Therefore, adequate amount of Pu-238 was a critical requirement for the mission. The Pu-238 would be encased in a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (^*BRTG^*N, shown below). The RTG would provide about 200 W, 30 V DC as it flew by Pluto. Pu-238 has a half-life of just over 87 years, so power drops by only 5% every 4 years. The RTG contains 24 lb of Pu-238 as plutonium-oxide pellets, clad in iridium and encased in a graphite shell.|hb|b|wb|b|ip|60|bm|blogs-images.forbes.com/jamesconca/files/2015/07/New_Horizons-RTG.jpg|ht|x|cp|8|at|^b@2^o@3

Unfortunately, security lapses and safety issues at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico had shut down the production of plutonium dioxide pellets for New Horizons' power generator. Not enough had been made to provide the 220 watts called for in the design.|

The New Horizons team asked, "How much power could you deliver?" The reply was 180 watts. Because of design decisions like the digital radio receiver, The New Horizons team thought the reduced power would be sufficient.

In addition to radioactive isotopes, there are a few full nuclear reactors in space as well (WNA). The SNAP 10-A, launched into space in 1965 by the United States, was a 45 kW thermal nuclear fission reactor with UZrH fuel that operated for 43 days and produced 590 watts, but was shut down due to an unrelated malfunction.

Before playing to the next trick, you must count declarer's tricks based on the play thus far. |

Declarer has four hearts (the play of the heart suit indicates that declarer has @HK J 9 x x), four diamonds, and a club. This amounts to a total of nine tricks! |
PG| ***** 176 ***** |


NT|^B@2
BUT - we have the lead at this moment in time. This means we must now find a way to get four fast tricks without letting declarer back on lead. Any ideas? |
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The clue will come from the bidding. Declarer has shown a minimum opening bid, almost certainly with five hearts and four diamonds. If declarer had one spade and three clubs, he would have rebid 3@C over 2@S. |
PG| ***** 178 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Ergo, declarer has three spades and one club or two spades and two clubs. For the contract to have any chance of being defeated, we must assume that declarer has two spades and two clubs for that gives partner four spades, the needed amount to (potentially) beat this contract. |
PG| ***** 179 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now that we have come this far in terms of assumptions, which spade should we switch to? |
PG| ***** 180 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In order to garner four spade tricks, you must project four spades in partner's hand headed by at least the @SK.|
PG| ***** 181 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The problem is that we mustn't block the suit. ^*BWhen holding three cards headed by two non-adjacent honors, lead the lower honor.^*N|
PG| ***** 182 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you lead the @S10 (which is the only card in your hand that defeats the contract), partner plays the king, returns a low spade to your ace and when you return your last spade partner is hovering over dummy's @S8 6 with the @S9 7 for a grand total of four spade tricks.|
PG| ***** 183 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This play would also have worked if our partner's spades were @SK J 7 x or @SK Q 7 x. Had you switched to the @S2 instead, the spades would have been blocked. Had you switched to the @SA and then the @S10, the defense will be in the wrong hand to finesse dummy's spades.|
PG| ***** 184 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|
You defend so beautifully! |NT|^B@2
The bottom line on this deal is that when you hold three cards headed by two non-adjacent honors (A 10 x, A J x, K 10 x, K J x, Q 10 x) attack with the lower honor (the middle card) if four tricks are needed (and both your partner and your left hand opponent specifically have four cards in the suit).|
