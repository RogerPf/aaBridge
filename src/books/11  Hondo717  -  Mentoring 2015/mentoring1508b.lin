^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East hand has 20 HCP but, there are a number of flaws which argue against opening the East hand 2N
^Ca) She is 5/4 in the majors
^Cb) She has a singleton|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


NT||lb|*bMake a bid for East please.^^1h|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Personally I would open it 1@H.|mb|1H|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


mb|p|NT||lb|*bMake a bid for West.^^2h|mb|1S|an|I may have to ask for an undo|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The rule is "support with support" when the system allows it. Therefore, if partner opens 1@H and you have 3 hearts and 6-9, you should bid 2@H, even if you have spades (even a lot of spades).|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The problem occurs when you have 3-card support and 10+ points. Then you can't support with support because you have no good raise. But with less than 10 you should always raise hearts.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


mb|p|NT||MB|3S|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Before I ask Faye if she wants an undo, let's look at the East bid.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


NT||lb|*yIs 3S by East forcing?^^n|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@S it is not forcing and Faye can pass the 3@S. Because, in this bidding sequence 2@S by East shows a min opener (12-14 or so). 3@S shows a medium opener (15-17 or so). So you should bid 4@S—not a sign off. It simply says you have around 19 or 20 points and 4 card support.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As what to do with 3-card support and 10+ (if West had such a hand). If you play 2/1 game forcing (which is what I recommend), then with an invitational hand and 3-card support you usually bid 1N forcing, intending to jump to 3 of partner's major at your next turn.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


NT||
ht|b|at|^bSo in this auction 3@H shows,|ht|b|cs|6|at|^h{|ia|1hp1np2dp3h|at|}|ht|y|at|^b10-12 and 3-card support. But the 1 exception is, partner can bid 1@S rather than 1N with 4 or more spades over 1@H.
|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With 3-card support and game forcing values, you bid a new suit. If you bid it at the 2-level it establishes a game force. |
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example 2@H in his auction,|HT|b|cs|6|at|^k{|ia|1hp2cp2dp2h|at|}|ht|y|at|^bshows game forcing values and 3-card heart support.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Again the only exception is if you have spades, 3-card heart support, and an opener. Then you bid 1@S and jump to 4@H as in this auction. |HT|j|cs|6|at|^g{|ia|1hp1sp4h|at|}.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, Even though Faye should have bid 2@h, this worked out ok, so I will leave the auction as is.|ub||

NT|^B@2
scubagirl0:  If West bid 1@s how would East show points?|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East can either raise spades to 4 or reverse or jump shift.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT|^B@2
boba4001:  In this bidding sequence, with spade support, East could bid 4@C to show 1 club and strong hand, right?|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My friend Bob is assisting me :). He is correct. I must got distracted and did not notice it. If East bid 4@C or 4@D over 1@S, that would show 4 spades, 19+ points and shortness in clubs or diamonds.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand if we were in 3@H we would be down 1 (losing 3 diamonds and 2 hearts). In IMPs it is -110 vs -100 which is worth no IMPs. In Match Points (face to face bridge) it would matter. Assuming 3@H is not doubled (which is unlikely) then it is -100 vs -110 which is good for us.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That was a very lucky hand for me. Both clubs broke and I got very lucky in diamonds. I would normally be happy to make 1N. Now let me comment on the bidding.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Whenever it goes 1N-P-P-?, you should strain to balance. Letting the opponents play 1N is rarely a good result. And on this hand, 2@S is a pretty good contract.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Susan, if she plays DONT, should strongly consider bidding 2@H, showing hearts and spades—5/4.|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most of you are correct. Technically I have 17 HCP but, I have a quality 5 card suit, which makes my hand worth 19 Starting Points. So I really should open 1@C, intending to rebid 2N over Faye's response. If I do that I am not sure what happens.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Faye probably bids 1H over my 1@C, I bid 2N and Faye passes. So we end up having the same result I think.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


AT|
scubagirl0:  Why pass?  You have game.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have 18 or 19. Faye has a quacky 6 count—deduct 1 for @Sj9. I think Faye should pass 2N bid. 3N is a terrible contract, which only makes because clubs are 3-3 and the diamond king is singleton. It has probably about a 5% chance of making—this hand is part of that 5%.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, to those "double dummy" analyzers that many bridge clubs use, they would say we can make 3N. But that is meaningless. If you gave the North/South hands to any expert, he or she would say 3N is a terrible contract. So you really should not pay any attention to them. I think they should be banned as worse than useless :).|

Plate Tectonics
|fp||at| From "A Short History of Nearly Everything"  by Bill Bryson |CP|1|AT|^*Hen.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Short_History_of_Nearly_Everything^*N|CP||AT|}^-|cs||ht|e|va|6|at|^B@2Old ideas die hard, and not everyone rushed to embrace the exciting new theory. Well into the 1970s, one of the most popular and influential geological textbooks, The Earth by the venerable Harold Jeffreys, strenuously insisted that plate tectonics was a physical impossibility, just as it had in the first edition way back in 1924. It was equally dismissive of convection and sea floor spreading. And in Basin and Range, published in 1980, John McPhee noted that even then one American geologist in eight still didn't believe in plate tectonics.|

Today we know that Earth's surface is made up of eight to twelve big plates (depending on how you define big) and twenty or so smaller ones, and they all move in different directions and at different speeds. Some plates are large and comparatively inactive, others small but energetic. They bear only an incidental relationship to the landmasses that sit upon them. The North American plate, for instance, is much larger than the continent with which it is associated. It roughly traces the outline of the continent's western coast (which is why that area is so seismically active, because of the bump and crush of the plate boundary), but ignores the eastern seaboard altogether and instead extends halfway across the Atlantic to the mid-ocean ridge. |

Iceland is split down the middle, which makes it technically half American and half European. New Zealand, meanwhile, is part of the immense Indian Ocean plate even though it is nowhere near the Indian Ocean. And so it goes for most plates.|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |

The connections between modern landmasses and those of the past were found to be infinitely more complex than anyone had imagined. Kazakhstan, it turns out, was once attached to Norway and New England. One corner of Staten Island, but only a corner, is European. So is part of Newfoundland. Pick up a pebble from a Massachusetts beach, and its nearest kin will now be in Africa. The Scottish Highlands and much of Scandinavia are substantially American. Some of the Shackleton Range of Antarctica, it is thought, may once have belonged to the Appalachians of the eastern U.S. Rocks, in short, get around.|
PG| ***** 130 ***** |

The constant turmoil keeps the plates from fusing into a single immobile plate. Assuming things continue much as at present, the Atlantic Ocean will expand until eventually it is much bigger than the Pacific. Much of California will float off and become a kind of Madagascar of the Pacific. Africa will push northward into Europe, squeezing the Mediterranean out of existence and thrusting up a chain of mountains of Himalayan majesty running from Paris to Calcutta. Australia will colonize the islands to its north and connect by some isthmian umbilicus to Asia.

These are future outcomes, but not future events. The events are happening now. As we sit here, continents are adrift, like leaves on a pond. Thanks to Global Positioning Systems we can see that Europe and North America are parting at about the speed a fingernail grows—roughly two yards in a human lifetime. If you were prepared to wait long enough, you could ride from Los Angeles all the way up to San Francisco. It is only the brevity of lifetimes that keeps us from appreciating the changes. Look at a globe and what you are seeing really is a snapshot of the continents as they have been for just one-tenth of 1 percent of the Earth's history.|

Earth is alone among the rocky planets in having tectonics, and why this should be is a bit of a mystery. It is not simply a matter of size or density—Venus is nearly a twin of Earth in these respects and yet has no tectonic activity. It is thought—though it is really nothing more than a thought—that tectonics is an important part of the planet's organic well-being. As the physicist and writer James Trefil has put it, "It would be hard to believe that the continuous movement of tectonic plates has no effect on the development of life on earth." He suggests that the challenges induced by tectonics—changes in climate, for instance—were an important spur to the development of intelligence. Others believe the driftings of the continents may have produced at least some of the Earth's various extinction events. |

In November of 2002, Tony Dickson of Cambridge University in England produced a report, published in the journal Science, strongly suggesting that there may well be a relationship between the history of rocks and the history of life. What Dickson established was that the chemical composition of the world's oceans has altered abruptly and vigorously throughout the past half billion years and that these changes often correlate with important events in biological history—the huge outburst of tiny organisms that created the chalk cliffs of England's south coast, the sudden fashion for shells among marine organisms during the Cambrian period, and so on. No one can say what causes the oceans' chemistry to change so dramatically from time to time, but the opening and shutting of ocean ridges would be an obvious possible culprit.|

At all events, plate tectonics not only explained the surface dynamics of the Earth—how an ancient Hipparion got from France to Florida, for example—but also many of its internal actions. Earthquakes, the formation of island chains, the carbon cycle, the locations of mountains, the coming of ice ages, the origins of life itself—there was hardly a matter that wasn't directly influenced by this remarkable new theory. Geologists, as McPhee has noted, found themselves in the giddying position that "^*Bthe whole earth suddenly made sense."^*N|

But only up to a point. The distribution of continents in former times is much less neatly resolved than most people outside geophysics think. Although textbooks give confident-looking representations of ancient landmasses with names like Laurasia, Gondwana, Rodinia, and Pangaea, these are sometimes based on conclusions that don't altogether hold up. As George Gaylord Simpson observes in Fossils and the History of Life, species of plants and animals from the ancient world have a habit of appearing inconveniently where they shouldn't and failing to be where they ought.|

The outline of Gondwana, a once-mighty continent connecting Australia, Africa, Antarctica, and South America, was based in large part on the distribution of a genus of ancient tongue fern called Glossopteris, which was found in all the right places. However, much later Glossopteris was also discovered in parts of the world that had no known connection to Gondwana. This troubling discrepancy was—and continues to be—mostly ignored. Similarly a Triassic reptile called Lystrosaurus has been found from Antarctica all the way to Asia, supporting the idea of a former connection between those continents, but it has never turned up in South America or Australia, which are believed to have been part of the same continent at the same time.|

There are also many surface features that tectonics can't explain. Take Denver. It is, as everyone knows, a mile high, but that rise is comparatively recent. When dinosaurs roamed the Earth, Denver was part of an ocean bottom, many thousands of feet lower. Yet the rocks on which Denver sits are not fractured or deformed in the way they would be if Denver had been pushed up by colliding plates, and anyway Denver was too far from the plate edges to be susceptible to their actions. It would be as if you pushed against the edge of a rug hoping to raise a ruck at the opposite end. |
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


AT|

Mysteriously and over millions of years, it appears that Denver has been rising, like baking bread. So, too, has much of southern Africa; a portion of it a thousand miles across has risen nearly a mile in 100 million years without any known associated tectonic activity. Australia, meanwhile, has been tilting and sinking. Over the past 100 million years as it has drifted north toward Asia, its leading edge has sunk by some six hundred feet. It appears that Indonesia is very slowly drowning, and dragging Australia down with it. Nothing in the theories of tectonics can explain any of this.|

Alfred Wegener never lived to see his ideas vindicated. On an expedition to Greenland in 1930, he set out alone, on his fiftieth birthday, to check out a supply drop. He never returned. He was found a few days later, frozen to death on the ice. He was buried on the spot and lies there yet, but about a yard closer to North America than on the day he died. Einstein also failed to live long enough to see that he had backed the wrong horse. In fact, he died at Princeton, New Jersey, in 1955 before Charles Hapgood's rubbishing of continental drift theories was even published.|

The other principal player in the emergence of tectonics theory, Harry Hess, was also at Princeton at the time, and would spend the rest of his career there. One of his students was a bright young fellow named Walter Alvarez, who would eventually change the world of science in a quite different way.|

Declarer starts on his Diamonds, naturally enough, and we have to decide what to throw on the second round. Well, it’s very easy to pitch a low Club, whilst thinking of other things (a nice holiday, a new car, what’s for dinner, that sort of thing) but the focus here must be on helping partner.|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Hung says the percentages are close between finessing and playing for the drop in diamonds. But that is actually not true. This hand is an example of the "law of restricted choice". That law says that if you are missing both the Q and J, and one of the defenders drops either the Q or J on the first round, you should play the other defender for the missing honor. |

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|So in this case, since South dropped the @DJ, you should play North for the @DQ (and not play South for @DQ J doubleton). It turns, the odds are about 2 to 1 that the finesse will work, not 50%.|
