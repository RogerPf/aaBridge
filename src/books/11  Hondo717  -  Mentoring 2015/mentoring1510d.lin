^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|OK, let us start with the 3@S bid. Admittedly Margaret has a very nice hand. I think 3@S is reasonable, but it does have some issues: 
^Ca) It does not strictly meet my competitive guidelines of 3 over 3 with 9 card fit or shortness in their suit
^Cb) 3 small is the worst holding you can have in the opponents suit. she could easily be losing 3 hearts
^Cc) what is she planning to do if they bid 4@H? That is a tactical consideration.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You need to consider that before you bid 3@S. It turns out they make 6@H or 6@C. Now should Kia bid 4@H?|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


AT|
I agree with his pass. He only has 3 card support and no shortness. I do think however, Ann should bid 4@H and double 4@S. They make slam in either hearts or clubs taking 6 clubs, 5 hearts, and 1 spade. Further, Ann could bid 4@H over 2@S (my choice). If partner has little a the @CJ and a doubleton spade, it has good plays.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Margaret playing low was fine and probably correct. The times you should play 2nd hand high are very rare. Just learn to play 2nd hand low smoothly and you will do better than most players.|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One point on the bidding. In theory, Ann does not have a double because she only has 2 diamonds and a takeout double should promise 3 cards in all of the unbid suits. However, you can make an exception with Ann's hand. It usually works out better when you have an opening hand and 4-4 in the majors to make a takeout double over 1 of a minor, even with a doubleton in the unbid minor. |
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Especially if you have a doubleton honor. Partner will strain to bid a major. And if partner bids diamonds, you are allowed to say "I owe you a diamond from last hand." So I would have doubled with Ann's hand even though it does not strictly have the correct distribution. On the other hand, I would guess more players would pass than double. |
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If she doubles I do cue bid 2@C to show a game force. We still end up in 4@H. But it turns out because then Ann bids hearts first over 2@C, we only make 4 because Kia leads a club and they take 2 clubs and a spade. As to Margaret's 2@C bid, if I had opened 1@H Margaret, would you have bid 2@C? Or at least considered it strongly.|
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


AT| I think the answer should be yes. As it turns out, we are getting to 4@H no matter what.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@H would be a reverse absent the 2@D bid. It is not exactly a reverse over 2@D. Let me illustrate by undoing the bid by East.|

mb|2h|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now the 2@H is a reverse because I intentionally passed the 2@C bid and North has to bid 3@C if he wishes to return me to my opening bid.

AT| It is not strong enough to reverse. But, using the Rule of 20, it is strong enough to open. So I treat it as a 5-5 hand and open 1@H. Then as a rebid I have the 2@C bid. But once Ann bids 2@D, I can no longer bid 2@C and regardless of the strength of my hand the 2H is not a reverse. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|OK. let us discuss 6-5 hands and my 2@H bid. When you are 5-6 with a higher ranking 5 card suit, you have a choice. To show your distribution you should open your 6 card suit. But if you are going to need to reverse to bid your 5 card suit, and you don't feel you are strong enough to do so you lie about your distribution and open your 5-card suit and treat the hand as 5-5. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My hand is certainly strong enough to reverse so I have no problem opening 1@C. Had Ann not bid 2@D I was going to bid 2@H anyway. But as I mentioned with a weaker hand and the same distribution I would open 1@H. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not sure what they can make. My guess is 2@D down 3 will be above average for E/W but not spectacular. Ann could have taken a bid, but pass was ok. On the other hand, 2 other choices are a negative double and 2N.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would have made a negative double and if pard bids 2@S I bid 2N. Of course if pard bids 3@C then I wish I hadn't made the negative double :).|
