^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A couple of review points. A 2N rebid by opener shows 18-19. It does not deny a 4-card major. (It does deny 4 hearts on this auction because you "support with support"). But it does not deny 4 spades.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Any time you have a balanced 18-19 as opener, you should expect your 2nd bid to be 2N most of the time regardless of whether or not you have a 4-card major. That is why it is important for responder to be able to play new minor forcing (or Checkback Stayman, my preference) over 2N.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If we changed Lisa's hand so it was @SAKJ2 @HQ98 @DA875 @CA3, she should still bid 2N even though she has 4 spades. 2@S would show an unbalanced hand almost always with 5+ diamonds and 4 spades. You always rebid 2N with any balanced 18-19. The only exception would be if Lisa had 4 hearts. Then she would bid 4H over 1H with 18 points.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT|^B@2
s_harv: If responder's bid is at the 2 level, does opener's 2N rebid still show 18-19?|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No. Only a jump to 2N shows 18-19. 1@S-2@C-2N just shows a balanced hand with 5 spades, but not extra strength.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First, let me ask Catherine what does she think 3@D should mean assuming that is the correct bid by West? |
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT|^B@2
petskosnet: Not sure. I already raised hearts. Please help out.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You do have 4 hearts so why don't you want to play in hearts. It is true that you raised hearts but, you might on occasion only have 3. By bidding 3@D (assuming that is the correct bid) Margaret wants to know if you have a min 2@H bid or a max 2@H bid.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you had @Sx @HAKx @Dxxxx @CAQxxx you should bid 2@H over 1@@H. You don't normally have 3 but you occasionally do. In any case, you know you have a 4-4 heart fit. If Margaret had, say an 11 point hand and was not sure whether or not to bid 4@H she might bid 3@D asking Catherine to decide whether or not to bid 4@H. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What if Margaret is showing an invitational hand with her 3@D bid. Catherine has 13 HCP + 1 point for the doubleton for 14 dummy points. In addition she has a very nice 14 points, with aces and kings,  3 quick tricks, and some 10s. So if I were Catherine, I would bid 4@H over 3@D, accepting the invitation.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||sk||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's get back to Margaret. The 3@D bid was ambiguous. With her hand she should look for slam after Catherine raised to 2@H. Let me undo her bid and start over.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


ub|3|NT||
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The way she does that is bid her 1st control that is higher than 3@H. So if she bids 3@S, that would show slam interest and a spade control. Any bid past 3@H establishes a game force by definition (since you can't stop below 4@H). Any bid below 3@H, in this hand, is a game try.|mb|3S|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this auction, Catherine also should be interested in slam. The 3@S bid is a bit of a problem. Since Catherine has both the @SA and @SK, she knows that the 3@S bid must be based on a singleton or void. So the @SK may be wasted.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |

NT||up|43|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very nice hand evaluation Margaret. This is a hand where Margaret should be counting both trump and diamonds. In general you should try and keep track of at least 2 suits, trump plus your longest side suit. Margaret did a great job figuring out that slam was possible. |
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT|^B@2
dirtysox88: Wondering if Margaret should bid 1@D instead of 1@H.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people suggested that Margaret bid 1@D with 6 diamonds and 5 hearts. That works out on this hand because it turns out East bids 1@H. But here is the problem. |
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Suppose it goes 1@C-1@D-1@S-?. West can bid 2@H, but that is simply 4th suit forcing to game. It will be very hard for West to get across that she has 5 hearts. So since her hearts are pretty nice and her diamond suit is not that good (although any 6-card suit is not bad) I would treat her hand as 5-5 and bid 1@H. But if you wanted to bid 1@D, that would not be wrong.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We also discussed why, if a game force is not yet established but you have found a fit, in order to look for slam you have to make a bid higher than 3 of your suit. On this hand East would bid 1@H. But suppose East only had 3 hearts and had 4 spades. Change her hand to @S AK54 @H K106 @D K10 @C 9643 then she would bid 1@S over 1@D.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So any way, once it goes 1x-p-1y-p-2y, where "y" = a major, in order to try for slam, you must make a bid higher than 3y (3@H on this hand). Any bid over 2@H higher than 3@H is a control bid. That is a very important point.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now lets discuss the 4N bid. Normally with a void it is not a good idea to bid 4N. And if you find yourself bidding 4N with a void, you should assume that one of the key cards is in your void suit, even though you are not sure. On this hand, Margaret knows the @SA is useful, because she can use it to throw a club loser. So 4N was a good bid here. |
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once Margaret knows that East has a diamond control, she knows that, if she has 4 key cards, 6 should make, regardless of whether the key card is a spade or a diamond.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had Catherine passed, I would have had a problem with my rebid. I am not good enough to bid 2@H which is a reverse. My diamond suit is really bad, so 2@D is not very palatable. Most likely, I would rebid 1N as the "best lie." |
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But since Catherine bid 1N I am relieved of having to bid. I could also double to show a better than min hand and suggest that we might want to defend against 1N. Many people play that a 1N bid in this type of auction, where both opponents have bid is what is known as a "sandwich NT" showing a weakish takeout double usually with a 5 card minor and 4 card major. |
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason being, if you think about it, if East has a real 1N overcall (15-18), her partner can't have much. The opponents have around 20 points at least, give or take a point or two. Catherine has 17, that doesn't leave much for Lisa, 3 or 4 at best and she could easily have 2 or fewer.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is why some people play 1N in this auction is sandwich, because even when East has a balanced 15-18, it is not clear that bidding 1N is a good idea. However, absent any agreement, 1N here is still what Catherine meant it to be, 15-18. So I am suggesting we penalize 1N. I am showing probably at least 15 or so.|mb|d|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Catherine can make 6 tricks. -200 is probably not a terrible board in IMPs, -3 or so. She was a little unlucky to find Lisa with 0 points, but, as I explained, not that unlucky. |
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although I am a "bid early bid often" advocate, I have found with balanced hands, even strong balanced hands, passing is often correct. Distribution is really the key to bidding. You can bid a lot with nice distribution. But you should be more cautious with flat distribution.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A very normal auction for a change today :). Margaret, before you play let me make a point. You have 9 sure tricks but, you have a clear play to make more. The hint is, West is not dangerous if she get on lead. So even if the diamond finesse loses, Margaret still has a heart stopper.|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the term we use is that East is the "dangerous hand". If East gets in then Margaret could lose a lot of hearts. But if West gets in Margaret still has a heart stopper which is why she could afford to take the diamond finesse.|

ht|g|at|^p@2It’s hot again, up in the Northern Hemisphere. It’s that time of year when the sun shines its most unforgiving beams, baking the ground and, indeed, us. It’s the portion of summer known as the hottest time of the year. Or, more delightfully, the dog days.|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


AT|

Contrary to common conjecture, the dog days do not take their peculiar name from weather that "isn’t fit for a dog," or heat that is so extreme it drives dogs mad. These folk etymologies shrink in comparison with the actual background of the phrase, a story of astronomical proportions.|
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


AT|

The dog days, in the most technical sense, refer to the one- to two-month interval in which a particularly bright star rises and sets with the sun, shining during the daylight hours and staying hidden at night. This star is known by three names: ^*BSirius^*N, the ^*BDog Star^*N, and ^*BAlpha Canis Majoris^*N. Apart from being the most prominent star in the constellation ^*BCanis Major^*N (Latin for "Greater Dog"), this heavenly body is responsible for the origin of the expression dog days, a phrase that has endured through millennia.|

ht|c|at|^p@2Classicists and astronomers will know the Dog Star as Sirius. The earliest record of this name comes from the Greek poet Hesiod, in ^*BWork and Days^*N, written in seventh century BC. Meaning "searing" or "scorching," Sirius encapsulates the Dog Star’s unusual brightness. Additionally, in Greek mythology Sirius is the name of the dog of Orion (a mythical hunter who has a constellation of his own adjacent to Canis Major), which further reinforces the Dog Star’s historical associations with canines. This tradition continues in the Harry Potter series; Sirius Black’s Animagus form is a large black dog.|
PG| ***** 141 ***** |


AT|

The Dog Star’s connection to dogs was not only maintained by constellations and mythology, it was boosted by the fact that dogs seemed to take the brunt of the dog days. They suffered from the heat more intensely than humans seemed to, and were at greater risk of madness.|
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


AT|

The English phrase dog days, which entered the language in the 1500s, is a direct translation from the Latin term caniculares dies, which refers to this specific seasonal phenomenon and is modeled after the same term in Hellenistic Greek. It is also from Latin that we got the word canicular, which refers to the Dog Star, as well the precursor to the expression dog days: canicular days.|

ht|f|at|^o@2The Dog Star, being the second brightest star that can be seen with the naked eye, did not escape the attention of ancient astronomers. Nor did its annual disappearance from the night sky and the corresponding influx of heat. Initially, ancient Greeks blamed the Dog Star for the sweltering weather, assuming that its brightness paired with the sun manifested in the hottest days of the year. This belief was debunked in the first-century BC by Greek astronomer Geminus, but the significance of the Dog Star remained untempered.|
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


AT|

In ancient times, the dog days would have roughly corresponded to the summer solstice. Due to precession, however, the days have fallen later and later in the year. The exact dates of the dog days depend on your latitude, but by today’s estimation they begin on July 3 and come to a close on August 11.|
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


ht|w|AT|^B@2Humans have been griping about the weather as far back as written history reaches, and the dog days were an important time for all. The Ancient Greeks and Romans, in particular, had grim feelings for Sirius, associating it with an outbreak of insufferable heat and fever. Civilization has long credited the objects in the sky with influence over the earth and its inhabitants; if it’s not the Dog Star cursing you with sultry summer heat and madness it’s the moon driving you to lunacy. It seems you can’t win when it comes to the celestial bodies.|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|East plays in 3NT after the simplest of auctions and you (South) lead the obvious fourth highest Heart. Partner’s play of the @HQ marks declarer with the @HK J. Naturally, declarer starts on his Club suit and you have to decide how to defend. |
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Your choices are to win the @CA and lay down the @HA, playing declarer for @HK J alone; you might win the @CA and try to put partner on lead for a lead through the remaining @HJ ×, hoping declarer started with @HK J × and partner still has a Heart left. Of course, you’d have to know which suit to switch to – partner might have an entry in either of Spades or Diamonds.|
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Naturally enough, the best play is to wait a while by ducking two rounds of Clubs. This isn’t done to isolate the dummy (it’s inconceivable that dummy doesn’t have an entry with at least one of its Kings) but to see if partner can make a worthwhile signal.|
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Here, North throws the @D8 followed by the @S2, which clearly indicates preference for Diamonds over Spades. So the defense is marked, win the third Club and switch to the @D10. Partner should realize what is required of him – he takes the @DA and fires back his remaining Heart. That’s Goodnight Vienna, two down.|

PG| ***** 203 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Over East's 2@H overcall, many play Double by the opener as something conventional called a "Support Double." This helps the partnership to distinguish the degree of their major fit (so when you raise to 2@S you have four-card trump support, but Doubling shows three-card trump support). |
PG| ***** 204 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Over West's 3@H raise, North shouldn't Pass. With a maximum passed hand, a take-out double of the 3@H bid is warranted (and denies five Spades). |
PG| ***** 205 ***** |


NT|^B@2
After North's Double, South with a maximum hand should then bid 4@D to complete the description of his hand shape. If South had a minimum hand (say the @DK was the @DJ), then he should just bid either 3@S or 4@C because 4@C might be the last making spot so you don't want to get too high with a 4@D bid. |
PG| ***** 206 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Play: 
It looks like you have a heart loser and most likely two spade losers unless something miraculous happens in spades. That miracle is hoping someone has @SK Q doubleton, or East holding a singleton spade honor.|
PG| ***** 207 ***** |


NT|^B@2
There is one more extra possibility: We can hope that someone has a doubleton honor so when we cash the @SA and exit with a low one, the person with the doubleton honor will be forced to win and then lead something to our advantage.|
PG| ***** 208 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But to make this plan successful, we first need to eliminate both red suits - that way when the opponent wins the spade, they will be forced to play either red suit giving us a ruff-and-discard. |
PG| ***** 209 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So, our LHO leads the @HA and continues with a low one in which we ruff.|
PG| ***** 210 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We draw two rounds of trumps (trumps are 2-2) and play three rounds of diamonds. We then come back to our hand via the @SA (the key play) and cash our last diamond, the @DK to discard a spade from dummy. |
PG| ***** 211 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now we exit a spade. If either opponent started off with a doubleton spade honor, they will now be forced to win the spade and play a red suit providing us with a ruff-and-sluff.|
PG| ***** 212 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On this deal, it is our LHO who has the doubleton spade honor and will give us the ruff-and-sluff to make our contract. |
PG| ***** 213 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Can you see how the opponents could have defended better? |
PG| ***** 214 ***** |


AT| At the point where we played a spade to the ace, West could have dropped the @SK under our @SA! This unblocks the spade suit and East would then be able to proceed to take two spade tricks with the @SQ 10.|
PG| ***** 215 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Could we have done better? Theoretically, no. As long as West is able to unblock the @SK then we are helpless.|
PG| ***** 216 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Practically, however, we might have done better. It would have probably been a bit better for us to dislodge our @SA much earlier in the play as West might not yet know what was going on and thus will not have the foresight to unblock the @SK. |
PG| ***** 217 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So after drawing two rounds of trumps, we can play the @SA, cash three diamonds while overtaking the third diamond with our king, ruff our fourth diamond in dummy, and THEN exit a spade. |
PG| ***** 218 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Although we could have done better, it appears that our West was still asleep anyway!|
PG| ***** 219 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The key play here is to realize that diamonds need to be eliminated before endplaying someone in spades.|
PG| ***** 220 ***** |


NT|^B@2
When there is not much hope to make your contract, try to think about how the defense can help you out.|
PG| ***** 221 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Here, you had hoped that an opponent had a doubleton honor, and although West did have that, it was still possible for a mis-defense that he wouldn't unblock it.|
