^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is the main problem with the bidding. You could question whether East should bid 1@S. East is a little light, but with such a nice suit I think 1@S is reasonable. If for no other reason than if pard ends up on opening lead, East would really like a spade lead.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West does not have a 3@C bid. 3@C promise a 5-card suit. West should either pass or bid 2N. I like 2N slightly better but it is very possible 2@H is going down.|

UP|44|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So just looking at the North/South hands, I want to be in 3N. But it is hard to bid. Even if North bids 2@S, which is a reverse I will bid 3@D and she will pass.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, North did well to pitch a heart. However once she does that, her only losers are in spades. Therefore, taking the finesse is right. Even if that loses, she will only lose 2 more spades if spades are not 3-3 or diamonds are not 2-2.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|She needs to keep track of both suits. Experts keep track of all 4 suits. but that is difficult for most players. But you should be able to train yourself to keep track of 2 suits. That will be sufficient on most hands.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Someone asked if East should bid Michaels (2@H over 1@H showing spades and a minor). East certainly has the distribution for a Michaels bid but I think 1@S is a much better call. East's spades are wonderful and the clubs are so-so. And it is always preferable to bid a major when you have the choice of 2 bids.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


mb|p|mb|4S|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't dislike 4@S, given the Law of Total Tricks and a 10-card fit. There is no really better bid. 3@S would be a weak hand with one less spade normally. 2@H would be a limit raise. West is close to a limit raise, but the @HQ is dubious.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I think 4@S is a good choice. I would not argue had she chosen to bid 2@H. But LOTT 4@S seems like a reasonable idea.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have no good lead. Normally a singleton trump is not a good lead. But when they have a 10 card fit likely, which this auction indicates, it is not as likely to give away a trick.|pc|S5|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There was no need to do that. You have no club losers. Not to mention (had you kept track of clubs as the 2nd suit as mentioned previously) that after cashing the @CQ, the @C9 and @C4 are good as we would be out of clubs.|pc|C5|

UP|41|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So 4@S worked out well as the LOTT usually does. Now let me briefly mention for those who play live bridge something about the printouts which tell you what you can and cannot make.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Those printouts are what are called "double dummy" analyzers. What that means is they look at how all 4 hands are actually laid out and decide what can be made. |
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So for example, say you have an 8-card suit missing the Q. As most of you know, the correct play is to take the finesse to avoid losing a trick. That is the best play in the long run.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But say on a particular hand one defender has the doubleton Q of trump offside. Had you looked at the defender's hand, then you would drop the queen. That is what the "double dummy" analyzer does.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It would tell you that you would make one more trick than you actually would in real life. But that is not realistic. The finesse is the correct play. |
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, take what those double dummy analyzers say with a large grain of salt. They are often very inaccurate based on the correct way to play the hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As many of you know. I absolutely agree with north opening 1N as opposed to 1@S. These days virtually all experts open 1N with 15-17 balanced even with a 5-card major. On most hands it results in more accurate bidding or at least as accurate.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And let me talk about how sometimes you can even show your 5-card spade suit. I am going to bid 2N showing 8 or 9 with 4 hearts. If North decided to accept my invitation: he should bid 3@S showing the 5th spade.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That give me a choice of 3N or 4@S. I cannot pass. So there are some hands where North can show the 5th spade.|mb|2N|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So 4@S was a very iffy contract. On a bad day we could end up losing 1 club, 1 heart 2 diamonds and a spade for down 2. But on a good day, with most things onside we could make 4.|
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is true that had North opened 1@S I bid 2@S. Then, I would pass 2@S with the North hand since I show at most 9 and North has 16 declarer points and we cannot have game. |
PG| ***** 96 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And had we not discussed showing the 5-card major we could end up in 2N. Both 2@S and 2N are reasonable contracts.|
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One more point about opening 1N with a 5-card major. Someone did an analysis of 10000 hands played in various world championship events. It turned out that opening 1N rather than 1@S always worked out better.|
PG| ***** 98 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, opening 1@H rather than 1N with 5 hearts worked out the same either way. For whatever that is worth I found it interesting.|

^*BActually^*N is the perfect example of a crutch word. It is meant to signify something that exists in reality, but it is more often used as a way to add punch to a statement (as in, "I actually have no idea"). The next word is one of the most chronically misused crutch words in English. Click ahead to find out what it is.|

This adverb should be used to describe an action that occurs in a strict sense. Often, however, it is used inversely to emphasize a hyperbolic or figurative statement: "I literally ran 300 miles today." Literally is one of the most famously used crutch words in English. The next one, however, may surprise you.|

This word is used to signal truth, simplicity, and confidence, like in "Basically, he made a bad decision." It should signify something that is fundamental or elementary, but too often this word is used in the context of things that are far from basic in order to create a sense of authority and finality.

The cardinal sinner of lazy words like is interspersed in dialogue to give a speaker more time to think or because the speaker cannot shake the habit of using the word. Like should describe something of the same form, appearance, kind, character, or amount. But, very often, it is used involuntarily in conversation, just like um.

North upgraded his hand to an 18-19 No-Trump because of the good five-card club suit, hence the 1@C opening. |
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


NT|^B@2

pg| ***** 161 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Play: 
Based on the auction, it is clear that our partner West won't have much in terms of high cards! |
PG| ***** 162 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Furthermore, the @D7 looks to be a very high diamond so we can also deduce that partner has a doubleton diamond at best (thus giving declarer two diamond stoppers).|HC|dkt|
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Therefore we must start to think about what partner can provide us in order to beat this contract. And this one card is the @CK. |LC|dkt|hc|ck|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If partner has the @CK then declarer will need to knock out both club honors, and the idea here is to realize that we must allow partner to keep that remaining diamond when partner is in with the @CK.|
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


lc|ck|NT|^B@2
If you play the @DA and then the @DQ, declarer can win and knock out West's @CK. With no diamonds to return, West will switch to a major suit and our diamond suit will not be set up.|
PG| ***** 166 ***** |


NT|^B@2
What if you play the @DJ or the @DQ? |
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Still not good enough, since declarer can DUCK this trick. This still provides declarer with a double stopper in diamonds but now if we play another diamond our partner's remaining diamond card will be gone.|
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Therefore, the only card to beat this contract is to insert the @D9. If declarer ducks this, then we can continue with the @DA and then the @DQ.|
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If declarer wins with the @D10 and plays a club, partner can win and return that ever helpful second diamond.|
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The bottom line here is that when partner leads from a likely doubleton in your long suit against a No-Trump contract with declarer having two stoppers in that suit, it is usually better to allow declarer to win the first trick to allow partner to keep his remaining card in case he has an early entry.|

But should East have three clubs in a 0-3-7-3 pattern he pitches when we lead to the spade ace, and overruffs dummy on the next. if we win the club in hand and lead the spade ace out, he ruffs that instead. Either way we are down one.|

When you lead the low spade from hand, you give the defenders an insoluble problem, assuming trumps are indeed originally 3-1. West will cover the spade and now if East lets him hold the trick he has no trump to return. if East ruffs his partner's winner, it is with his last trump. Again, he cannot kill the spade ruff in dummy. |

Pablo Lambardi gave me a great declarer play problem from the first day of the teams. Any decent self-respecting West would lead the @SK against 5@C and give you an easy task. Pablo was faced with the lead of the diamond queen, overtaken by East and ruffed. Lambardi knew spades strongly rated to be 6-0; he had four spades to dispose of and no easy placed to put them. He took the heart finesse and then cashed @HA; one down three to go! |
PG| ***** 208 ***** |


NT|^B@2
He next played a spade from dummy; East defended strongly by ruffing and returning a trump. Lambardi now had a choice as to how to get rid of one of his two losing spades; if East had started life with a doubleton club the play was easy, he could win the club ace and lead a spade to the ace and ruff a spade. |
PG| ***** 209 ***** |


NT||NT|^B@2
But if East had three clubs he would discard when the second club was led, then overruff dummy. Lambardi decided correctly that East rated to 0-3-7-3. How should he play now? |
PG| ***** 210 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The answer is simple --when you think of it! Lambardi won the club shift in hand and led a low spade. If West won the trick he could not prevent declarer ruffing his remaining spade with @CK, and if east ruffed in he would have no trump left to lead any more so declarer could take the ruff in peace and comfort.|
