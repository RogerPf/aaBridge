^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is a much more precise bid than overcalling or doubling, and the earlier you can define your hand for pard, the more likely you are to get to the best contract.|

PG| ***** 93 ***** |

NT|^B@2
(I told you the bidding would tell you the story.) That means the poor declarer only has three. We are going to have to play the suit carefully to garner (hopefully) five tricks in Hearts.|

PG| ***** 120 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|When we defend, every single card we play should send a message, and thus it is with this hand. Our partner passes at his first opportunity to bid, and when he leads the @H6 we begin our Count and Plan. We count the Heart suit and figure the declarer for three. Why? He didn't respond 1@H to his pard's opening 1@D opener, that's why. He surely can't have four. Since Pard didn't pre-empt, he isn't likely to have six. So there you have it: five for pard and three for declarer.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|We pause to look at the dummy, and see that declarer is probably going to set up the Diamonds for five tricks. If Pard has the @DQ, it's toast (aka finessable). So! If we want five tricks, and we sure do, we need to find Pard with the @HA. |
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|At trick 1, we smack down our @HK. We now return the @H3. This tells partner that we have an odd number of cards left in the suit. Pard will now know that we started with four. He has the suit counted out too. |
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Pard wins trick 2 with the lowest Heart he can. Trick 3 is where we can blow the entire thing. If we've been paying attention, we know that if we don't play our @H9 on trick 3, it will take trick 4 and that will be the last trick we take. Look at poor Pard. There's no way back to him! |

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|This looks to be a tricky contract. Given the 1@S overcall, we can expect the @SAQ to be on our left. It looks like we need something favorable to happen in the Diamond suit.|
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


NT|^B@2
More specifically, we need to play the Diamond suit for four winners - so we can discard two of our Spades. This will require the @DK to be with West, of course, but what about the @D10? Should you play for Diamonds to be 3-3, or 2-4?|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|Now the critical point. Should you ruff and play for Diamonds to be 3-3, or should you run this and play for Diamonds 2-4 with @D10 as East?|
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


NT||lb|*yshould declarer ruff?^^n|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|The probable answer comes with counting out the opponent's hand distribution. What has West shown up with so far?|
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West has five Spades and a doubleton Heart. For West to have opened the play with the @CQ lead means that he most likely has @CQ-J-10-(x).|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West has also shown up with @DK and @D6. This accounts for twelve out of thirteen of West's cards.|
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That should help you work out the likelihood of the Diamond suit distribution?|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|West leads the Queen of Clubs against your 6@H. When the dummy goes down, you see that partner had nothing to spare for his splinter bid. How will you tackle the play?|
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You win the Club lead and draw trumps with the King and Queen, East throwing a Club on the second round. There is no escaping the Diamond finesse. You lead the Jack of Diamonds and this is covered by the King and Ace. |
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|After returning to the bare Queen of Diamonds, you re-enter dummy with the Ace of trumps. When you lead the nine of Diamonds East follows impassively with the Diamond seven. Should you run the nine or ruff in your hand, playing for the Diamonds to be 3-3?|
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|It is not a close decision. West started with seven or eight cards in the majors, compared with East’s two or three. Also, West had an easy trump lead from a doubleton, so his actual Club lead surely proclaims a Q-J-10(-x) sequence there. |
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|He will hold three Diamonds only when he holds five Spades, rather than six, and Q-J-10 bare in Clubs. You should therefore run the nine of Diamonds. On the evidence that you have seen the odds are around 3-to-1 in favour of this play. |
