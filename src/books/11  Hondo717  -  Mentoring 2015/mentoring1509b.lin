^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Despite only holding 6 clubs and the unfavorable vulnerability (we are vulnerable and they are not) I decided to preempt 3@C. I have a very nice suit and a void in the opponents suit—worth its weight in gold.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The preempt gave West the problem I was hoping to give her. She has no perfect bid. I would either make a negative double or pass. If West made a negative double, partner needs to understand that West may not have the perfect shape (at least 4-4 in the majors) that it promises. |
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
 ^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 3@C bid puts West under pressure and she may have to choose an imperfect bid. I don't think I would bid 3D as that is particularly flawed in terms of both being over strength and shorter in diamonds than I am promising.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@C was a nice bid by North. North is allowed to assume I have 7 clubs, but should keep in the back of her mind that I might only have 6 (since I can't preempt at the 2-level in clubs as I can in the majors). But even if I only have 6 clubs, the bid still meets the Law Of Total Tricks. |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out if we play in 4@C we are down 2, as I take 6 clubs, 1 heart, an a spade ruff. I might even get a diamond trick if the defense slips.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Gary made a very nice call of 4@S. With his club void he really wants to play the hand rather than defend. He could just bid 4@D, but 5@D could easily be making based on the auction. So instead of just bidding 5@D, 4@S gives partner an additional option of passing if she had 4 spades but could not show them over 3C, as is what happened on this hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As far as the play, this is a difficult hand to play, but it can be made. Personally, I would hope trumps are 3-2 and try to set up my diamonds. So, after wining the opening lead, I would lead a spade to the A,|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nicely done. On all hands, but especially in slams, you should count your winners before playing to trick 1. Counting your winners in a slam contract is usually easy and fun because you have so many winners usually.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|6N is a fine bid, but in general it is easier to make 6 of a suit contract than 6N. That was not true here but in general it is true. As an alternative bidding, but this is not standard, I play all jumps to the 3 level are natural, forcing and slam tries. People play all sorts of fancy 3 level bids that hardly ever come up. I like my nice simple jumps to 3 are slam tries. |
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So playing my system Gary could bid 3@C. And if Margaret liked clubs she could start to control bid. with her hand, with K10x of clubs and lots of aces and kings, I would bid 3@D showing the @DA or @DK. That's about all Gary needs to know and they would end up in 6@C.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Of course in Match Points, 6N is more points, but in IMPs 6@C and 6N score about the same. Anyway, you might consider playing my 3 level jumps as slam tries, where, if the NT bidder likes the suit, they control bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My hand is a great hand. and the auction made it even better. We have a heart fit, I have a very nice 6-card suit and I have a singleton in the pre-empters suit. It is worth about twice as much as the 9 HCP that many players would assign to it.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's count my Bergen Dummy Points. I have 9 HCP, -1 for dubious @DJx, plus 2 length points + 1 quality suit point in spades, 3 points for the singleton with 4 trump, and + 1 point for the doubleton for 15 points. So I will make a slam try by bidding 4@C. This normally shows shortness but it could show the @CA. It is essentially a splinter bid.|mb|4C|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The most important thing to discuss is the play. This is a hand where Susan wants to draw trump ASAP and then set up spades. That way at worst she will lose 1 diamond, 1 heart and 1 spade.|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if she starts with the @HA and a low heart, the hand will be made. The spades are now set up and Susan can throw her minor suit losers on the spades. This is a good illustration of why you should draw trump ASAP unless you have a good reason not to.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's discuss Gary's 3@C bid. I have two reasons I would not make the bid. His hand is too good. There is a real possibility that, if pard  has the @CA 3NT is making. And he has 3 hearts. I would be more inclined to bid 3@C if North had opened 1@S (although I still would bid 2@C. But over 1@H, 3@C seems like it has more to lose and less to gain.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it turns out it doesn't matter on this hand as we will get to 4@H. Also, Gary might consider leading a spade on opening lead since he has a heart trick. The hand will then be defeated for sure as it turns out because Margaret will win the spade give him a spade ruff. |
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Gary will then lead the @DK, and eventually take the @HK and @DQ, in addition to the @SA and a spade ruff, for down 1. But the spade lead could also make it easy for declarer. So it is a higher risk lead than the CK.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Someone asked me about Match Points vs IMPs. On BBO, most of the time you play IMPs. The idea in IMPs is to bid your games and avoid any big losses. As declarer just make your contract (overtricks are irrelevant) and as defender beat the contract (undertricks are irrelevant). That is because basically the number of IMPs you win is based on your total score comparted to average. |
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you have a large positive difference between your score and average you win a lot of IMPs. For example, if you make +620 and everyone else is +170 (you were the only 1 to bid game) you are 450 points to the good which translates to around 8 or 9 IMPs.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In IMPs the size of your score matters. Small differences (undertricks and overtricks) are almost irrelevant. You are looking for large differences by bidding games that others don't bid. So in IMPs if a game is even remotely possible (40% chance or more vul) you should bid it. In Matchpoints the size of the score doesn't matter. It only matters how many pairs you do better than.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, in IMPs, if you are +110 and everyone else is +100, that is completely irrelevant. you won't win any IMPs. But in Match Points, you would get a top score, because your 110 is the highest score, even if only 10 points. Therefore, in Match Points overtricks and undertricks are important.|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you take one more trick than everyone else that is great. What that also means is that bidding close games is not important. Because the extra 300 or 500 that you score is no better than if you scored +30 for making an overtrick. So in match points you are more aggressive in competition, but less aggressive bidding games. |

^-|fp||ht|c|at|^b@2One reason among many is because the New Horizons spaces craft is far away -- very far away. This unbelievable distance does impede the transmission of even the photons even at speed of light.|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


AT|

On average, Pluto is approximately 39.5 Astronomical Units, or AU, from the sun. That is almost 40 times farther from the sun than Earth is. Because of its elliptical orbit, Pluto's closest point to the sun is 29.7 AU. 1 Astronomical unit = 92,955,807.3 miles. It is rounded to 93 million miles. In outer space couple hundred thousand miles are small change,|
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


AT|

The closest distance between the Earth and Pluto occurs when Earth is at its most distant from the Sun, and Pluto is at its closest. And the Sun, Earth and Pluto are lined up in a perfect line. When this happens, Pluto and Earth would be separated by 2.625 billion miles or 4.2 billion km. At their most distant, Earth would be at its furthest at the opposite side of the Sun from Pluto. At this point, Earth and Pluto would be separated by 4.687 billion miles or 7.5 billion km.|

Currently, the New Horizon spacecraft is traveling in the Kuiper Belt at 36,000 miles per hour away from the Pluto and the Earth. As of September 12, 2015 15:00:00 UTC (0800 Pacific Time) the spacecraft was more than 33 times Earth's distance from the Sun (33.41 Astronomical Units or AU). That is approximately 3,107,130.000 miles—3,069,000,000 miles from Earth. The Astronomical Unit or AU is a unit of length, roughly the average distance from the Earth to the Sun. That distance varies as the Earth orbits the Sun, from a maximum to a minimum  and back again once a year. It is now defined as exactly 93 million miles or about 150 million kilometers. UTC is Universal Time Coordinated.

In early September, NASA announced that, in the next 16-18 months they will begin downloading the approximately 95% (60 to 80 Gigabits) of the information still on New Horizons's recorders from the Pluto flyby. |
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


AT|

For most of us who easily can download or upload several Gigabits in a short time this may appear strange. But because of billions of miles between the spacecraft and Earth the New Horizons' radio signals are weak. Therefore, NASA’s Deep Space Network of antenna stations is used to receive the data from New Horizons |
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


AT|

Weak signal means low data rates. At the moment, New Horizons can transmit at most 1 kilobit per second. (Note that spacecraft communications are typically measured in bits, not bytes; 1 kilobit is only 125 bytes.)|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


AT|

If we do the math, 2.5 Megabits, at 1 kilobit per second: it takes 42 minutes to return one LORRI photo to Earth. Most communications sessions last about eight hours. That's eleven images per communications session. And that assumes that New Horizons is transmitting only LORRI data, which it's not. There are other science instruments and spacecraft housekeeping data, too.|

LORRI, which stands for Long Range Reconnaissance Imager, is New Horizons' highest-resolution camera. LORRI's detector is 1024 pixels square. Like many modern space cameras, when the camera reads out its detector, it digitizes each pixel as a 12-bit number. Twelve million is an awful lot of bits, but fortunately LORRI's images are amenable to lossless compression, especially now when they contain mostly black space; they can be zipped up to about 2.5 Megabits without any loss of detail. They can be made even smaller with lossy JPEG compression, but for optical navigation, precision counts; the pictures have to be returned losslessly.|

That may be enough power for two more decades of exploration, according to NASA. However, the RTG provides about 200 W, 30 V DC. That is very small and Nasa cannot simultaneously turn on all the equipment on New Horizons.|

For example, during the 8 hour transmitting data session to Earth, its antenna must be pointed to the Earth and all its cameras and sensors are off. Therefore, conserving precious electrical power has been NASA'a main priority and as a result has limited the rate of transmission. New Horizons conserved energy by taking “naps” during the monumental trip.|

New Horizons still has to tell Earth exactly what it saw at Pluto. New Horizons is carrying a trove of data, including high-resolution imagery, that has yet to return home. The big Pluto download won’t be finished until about the end of October 2016. All considered, transmission rates are slow, and will get even slower, as the spacecraft gets more distant.|

Until now, New Horizons has been concentrating on lower data-rate information from its energetic particle, solar wind, and space dust instruments with only a smattering of images thrown in as insurance against systems failures, but on September 5, NASA turned the metaphorical tap open. The probe is now sending back packets of information at a relatively high rate as it starts a download of high-resolution images and other data that will take about a year. NASA is making the images from New Horizon’s Long Range Reconnaissance Imager LORRI available to the public as they come in. The first release is scheduled for September 11.

Surely, by the time you read this there would be more.|

NT||PC|cjc3|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|We need to calculate how many tricks we can take in defense. Partner made a negative double (showing exactly four spades). So that will give us only two tricks there. The @CA gives us the third trick ... where can we get three more tricks?|
PG| ***** 201 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|The first assumption should be based on the club suit. Partner has led the @CJ and we can see the @C 10 9 3 in dummy, which means declarer has the @CK. |
PG| ***** 202 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|We are going to win the first trick and obviously declarer is going to drop the @CK, whether it is singleton or doubleton, but that should not deter us towards hoping that the contract can be beaten.|PC|CACK|

pg| ***** 204 ***** |


lb|*mWas the lead a singleton?^Yes~No~I am not sure^3|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|We must assume partner's lead is based on a singleton.|
PG| ***** 206 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Why? Rather than asking why, you should ask yourself: how else are we going to beat the contract? Well in fact, it is just barely possible that partner might actually have @HK Q x (or @HK J x) and the @DA to take the required three tricks.|
PG| ***** 207 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|What does this mean we should do?|
PG| ***** 208 ***** |


AT|

We need a way of finding out what type of hand partner has - does partner have the @HK Q x and the @DA, or does partner have a club singleton?|
PG| ***** 209 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|If the former, we need to take our spade tricks else declarer can discard a spade on dummy's club(s), and if the latter, we need to give partner one or two club ruffs.|
PG| ***** 210 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|How can we find out which type of hand partner has? Have a think about it.|NT||lb|*CWith all your thinking, click that card on the right which you should play.^^sq^h97Sakqd98c86542|
PC|SQ|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|There are at times when the defense is on a complete guess. However, this isn't one of those times.|
PG| ***** 212 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|We have worked out that two of our spades are cashing. Upon winning the @CA, we can cash a spade to see what signal partner will give us which should tremendously help our defense.|
PG| ***** 213 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|If partner signals discouragement, it means partner wants a club ruff, and if partner signals encouragement, it means partner wants us to continue and not switch to clubs.|
PG| ***** 214 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|That's not all though - the specific spade that we should cash is the queen. This way, when declarer does not cover the @SQ with dummy holding @SJ 10 6 5, it will be clear to partner that we have @SA K Q, and therefore needs some guidance as to how the defense should continue.|

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding: 
You obviously open 1@C but after a 1@H overcall, a negative Double and a 2@H raise, it is best to Pass with your hand.|
PG| ***** 225 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|It may feel like you want to show your extra club length, but rebidding a suit at the three-level should announce extra strength and a decent suit quality. @CA 8 6 5 4 2 just doesn't cut the mustard.|
PG| ***** 226 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|If your hand was instead @SA x x @Hx x @Dx x @CA K Q x x x  then that's a perfectly reasonable 3@C bid because of the great club suit. |
PG| ***** 227 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Play: 
Counting tricks is very important when declaring a hand, but it is also equally important to do it on defense too.|
PG| ***** 228 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, you should be able to count three tricks in your hand - you have the @CA and the most number of spades you can take is two. Why?|
PG| ***** 229 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Well partner made a negative double showing exactly four spades, so that gives declarer two spades. |
PG| ***** 230 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|So how should we defend this contract? Well to start off with, we should be thinking about how we can beat the contract - don't worry about overtricks (unless it's Matchpoints), but think about the possible ways to defeat the contract. |
PG| ***** 231 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|One immediate thought that comes to mind is to hope maybe partner has the @HK Q x (or @HK J x) and the @DA which adds an additional three tricks to our hand.|
PG| ***** 232 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|If that's the case then our defense is easy. We cash three of our tricks, and wait until partner can take three of their tricks. |
PG| ***** 233 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|But that might be an unlikely holding for partner because along with the @CJ, that gives partner 10 points and he might've done something over the 2@H bid. So what's another possibility?|
PG| ***** 234 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|The other possibility is to hope that partner has a singleton club. Unlikely or likely it may be, if hoping partner has a singleton club is our only way of defeating the contract, then we must make that assumption and plan our defense based on it. |
PG| ***** 235 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|So does this means that our play to the second trick will depend on our 'guess' about which hand partner is holding? |
PG| ***** 236 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Sometimes the answer might be yes. And whichever way you 'guess' is based on the likelihood of partner's hand.|
PG| ***** 237 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|If it were a complete guess on this hand, then we'd hope partner has a singleton club because partner having 10 points with @HK Q x and @DA is just less likely than a singleton club. 

BUT, on this hand we don't need to guess.|
PG| ***** 238 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|We know that declarer has exactly two spades and on this deal, we have the chance to cash one of our spades to get a signal from partner to see which defense we should be playing for. |
PG| ***** 239 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Don't just stop there though, there's one more step to take. After winning the @CA, the exact spade card that we should switch to is the @SQ. Why do you think that is?|
PG| ***** 240 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Well, it probably shouldn't matter as partner should be Signalling based on if he wants a club ruff or not, but don't take that chance. If we switch to the @SA, partner might think that we want a spade ruff and thus will discourage when he doesn't hold the king.|
PG| ***** 241 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|If partner has the unlikely hand of @HK Q x and @DA, then we don't want partner to signal encouragement or discouragement based on their holding in spades. (Similar reasons can be applied to the @SK switch.) |
PG| ***** 242 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|To make the defense very clear and easy to partner, we must switch to the @SQ.

When declarer doesn't cover our spade with dummy holding @SJ 10 6 5, it will be clear to partner that it is us who holds @SA K Q.|
PG| ***** 243 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore partner will encourage or discourage on this trick based on if partner wants a club ruff or not rather than based on the spade suit itself. 

Whew, it all seems like a lot of complication just based on defending a measly little contract of 2@H!! |
PG| ***** 244 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|So, upon switching to the @SQ partner will give us a discouragement signal of @S2.

Had partner encouraged, it will mean that partner probably has @HK Q x and the @DA (or the @HK J x) and wants us to take our other spade trick as soon as possible (before declarer can discard it on a club). |
PG| ***** 245 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Upon discouraging spades, we will then switch to the 8 of clubs. This is a suit preference signal telling (re-assuring) partner that upon ruffing this club trick, he should return the two higher remaining suit - here, it's spades. |
PG| ***** 246 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, technically we have already told our partner the location of the @SA K by our switch of the @SQ, but as a general rule we mustn't confuse our partner. 

Imagine if you were in partner's shoes instead:|
PG| ***** 247 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|You received a club ruff, but the club card that partner played to give our ruff was the @C2, suggesting a diamond return. But partner told us about the spade honors with the @SQ switch, so which suit should I actually return? Bottom line is, don't make a confusing play when you can avoid it!|
PG| ***** 248 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|So, after returning the @C8 partner will ruff it and return a spade to our king to which we should return another club for partner to ruff (or a trump promotion). As it is on this deal, partner's @HQ will be promoted to another trump trick.|
