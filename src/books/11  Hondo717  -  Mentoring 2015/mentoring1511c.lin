cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First the bidding. The question is, should Joan bid 2@H? It is really more of a tactical decision. I think 2@H is fine. In general preempting works out well for your side, but there are 2 minuses to Joan preempting.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One is she is a little strong. So it is possible they might miss game. The 2nd is she has 4 spades so they might miss a spade fit. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As most of you know, in general I have no problem preempting with an outside 4 card major and if Joan were weaker (make her AJ of clubs the QJ for example) then 2@H is pretty clear despite her 4 spades. But because 1@H is possible and gives their side more flexibility, I might choose 1@H with her hand although 2@H is fine as well.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to whether or not they should be in 4@H. I would say yes even though she only made 3. If one of the black suit finesses work, she makes 4. So it is a good contract.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to whether they get there if she bids 1@H, not. If it goes 1D-1@H-I bid 2@H Bonnie might then bid 3@D (limit raise in hearts) and that might or might not get Joan to bid 4@H.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's discuss the 1@D bid by Shirley. Many players routinely open 1@D with 4 diamonds and 5 clubs. I very much disagree in general with that approach. If it goes, for example, 1@D-P-1@S-P-2@C, responder will often not know what to do if they cannot be sure how many clubs and how many diamonds opener has. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If they have equal length in both minors, which minor should they choose? So I feel, in general, you should open 1@C with 5 clubs and 4 diamonds. However, on this hand, I think 1@D is a good choice with a quality diamond suit and a club suit with no honors, 1 diamond is a good choice.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|the bidding was fine and the approach Bonnie took was correct. So long as diamonds break 3-2 she can take 9 tricks at least, 3 diamonds, 3 clubs, 2 spades and a heart. |
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is a small subtlety in the play that is not that important but an expert might do. And that is, at trick 2, rather than leading the @DK from her hand, Bonnie might play a diamond from dummy. She could play a club to East hand first.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The only reason to do that is in case I have a singleton @DA which is a very small chance. But if I do, then she makes 3 diamond tricks whereas if she leads the @DK she does not. So the way she played it was fine but experts are always looking for that little extra 2% edge.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As a player I am not happy about the auction. However, although, as you know, I believe in aggressive bidding, I also believe that distribution is more important than HCP.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have, also, found that in a competitive auction, if partner has not bid and you don't think you have a fit you are better off passing with a strong balanced hand and defending than competing. That is one of the few times where I think passing is better than bidding (that doesn't happen with me very often :) ).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Interesting hand. We might make 5@D if we guess diamonds correctly which is fairly easy given the auction.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT|^B@2
What about Joan's 3@S bid? It is not the bid I would have made as it does not follow the LOTT. But if she had passed, I would have bid 2N (which show 19ish points). Presumably Shirley bids 3@C and I am not sure what Bonnie does. |
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT|^B@2
BTW, I might violate a tenet of bidding with Shirley's hand and bid 4@S over 3@S. Shirley is right to pass in theory. Once she preempts, if partner makes a single raise, she has said her piece and should pass. However, with 6-6 hands, there are no good bidding rules. So what Shirley has to do is picture hands that Joan can have.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT|^B@2
ladydoc: If I'd pictured her with the king of spade, I would bid four.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Exactly, if she has a spade honor and a club honor, you want to be in 4. Or even a spade honor and the @DA. So I might venture 4 with Shirley's hand over 3@S. 99.5% of the time you are supposed to pass 3@S. You don't have to worry Shirley. It won't be right to bid 4@S over 3@S for another 2 years :).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this auction, Joan should assume that Shirley most likely has a 5-8 point weak 2 heart hand. 2@H is almost always passed. If partner bids a forcing 1N and then bids a new suit at the 2 level that shows a weakish weak 2 type of hand.|

PG| ***** 69 ***** |


AT| The answer is it is barely possible but not likely because if she did have 2 clubs, that would give Shirley 4 and Shirley might have passed 2@C. However I have nothing better to do.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played Shirley. Normally Shirley's 2@H bid shows 6 hearts and is to play. She was a little lucky that Joan had 3 hearts. However, it is not clear what she should do. Passing 2@C is possible, but Joan is only promising 3 clubs. I might bid 2N with her hand.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not sure how that does. Probably ok since she can take 5 hearts and 2 spades for sure and will certainly get at least one trick in the minors.But the main point here is, that over a forcing NT, if the forcing NT bidder then bids a new suit, that shows a long suit and a weakish hand and is to play.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT|^B@2
bjmue:  Is NT forcing by a passed hand?|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bonnie asks a good question. You have to decide whether 1NT is forcing by a passed hand. A lot of people play it is not forcing. In that case, here, East should pass 1NT with her flat 12 count. But here is 1 problem if you play it non-forcing. If passed responder has a 3-card limit raise, you may end up in 1NT instead of game in your major. There are 2 ways to solve that problem.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One is to play Drury, such that responder bids 2@C with a 3-card limit raise if partner is a 3rd or 4th seat opener. In which case the 1N bid will never be made with 3-card support.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other is to play it "semi-forcing" meaning it is sort of forcing, but opener is allowed to pass with a 5-3-3-2 12-14 count. That is what would have happened here, but as we saw, NT was just as good a contract as hearts anyway. Having said all that, unless I play Drury, I like to play 1NT as forcing even by a passed hand. I find it works out better for me.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The most important point of this hand is to use Bergen points to evaluate your hand. Many players with only 9 HCP might only bid 3@S over 3@C and it is not clear whether or not north should bid 4@S.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is hard to say for sure. Certainly not at this vul. At equal VUL you could easily have 2 spade and 2 heart losers. That is down 2 assuming you don't lose any other tricks. I probably don't do it at equal, although it is not obvious.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|At favorable VUL I probably do, because there is the added benefit that the opponents will often (and sometimes incorrectly) bid 5 over 5 because they don"t think they will set you enough to make up for their lost game.|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the answer is I probably only bid 5@C if I am not vul and they are.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other point here was planning the play. I came up with a plan that would probably only lose 3 tricks and take 10 tricks. It turns out with diamonds favorable I can't go wrong, but if Bonnie had the @DQ I could easily have gone down if I incorrectly went after hearts.|

What do you think the Diamond layout is? What is the best defense? It is possible that declarer's @DQ is a true card (partner could hold @DK J 9 7 3; certainly he would return his fourth highest Diamond). |
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, does that fit with the bidding? If declarer has only two Diamonds and no four-card major (remember the bidding?) he would have to be 3-3-2-5. Possible but less likely than the other possibility.|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Partner could have @DK 7 3, declarer could have @DQ J 9 2 - that is also consistent with the play. If that were the case, how should you defend?|

Well, the contract is going off now, whether or not declarer has a Diamond left. It would be humiliating to find declarer started with @DQ 2 alone and we have given away an unnecessary trick but we've all done worse things.|
PC|d9|NT|^B@2
Ah! Declarer obviously did start with @DQ J 9 2, so our defense was the only successful one.|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|You (South) lead the @D6 against 3NT by East and a decent dummy appears. Partner wins the first trick with the @DK and returns the @D7, declarer following with the @DQ. How do you defend?|
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Well, it is just possible that East started life with @DQ 2 and North with @DK J 9 7 3 – the carding is consistent with that. However, is that likely? East has opened 1NT and has denied a major suit over a Stayman 2@C enquiry. He might only have two Diamonds but his shape would have to be the very precise 3-3-2-5 for this to be the case.|
PG| ***** 146 ***** |


NT|^B@2
More credible is that partner has @DK 7 3 in Diamonds and declarer has @DQ J 9 2. If this is the layout you have to duck the second round of Diamonds, both to retain communication with partner and also because you don’t want to switch suits (continuing Diamonds would be fatal).|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


NT|^B@2
East needs the Spade finesse for his contract so he runs the @SQ at trick 3. North wins the @SK and plays a third Diamond, through the @DJ 9, and you are in a position to cash three more tricks to beat the contract.|
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Footnote. 3NT is cold – East has misplayed it. Can you see that it is (nearly) 100% certain? All declarer has to do (certainly should do) is to put the @D9 on the second round of the suit. Now, no likely division of the cards can defeat him…|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Here the finesse is a better proposition than playing the @DA (hoping that the @DQ falls in two rounds). The @D10 will win whenever West has the @DQ (50% of the time). The @DA will drop the @DQ considerably less than this (about 30% of the time). It's not good odds.|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Comment: Here you arrive in 3NT after a brief auction and West leads the @HQ.|
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You can see seven top tricks (two Spades, two Hearts, two Diamonds and the @CA) and need two more. There is no chance of an extra trick in Spades or Hearts and little prospect of getting anything out of Clubs so the focus of the deal is on playing the Diamond suit to your advantage. If you can make four tricks here you are home and dry.|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So what is the right way to play Diamonds? You need to know (all right, make that “guess”) which opponent has the @DQ and to play the suit to finesse against him. So is the play a straightforward 50-50 shot? You just have to guess who has the @DQ and take the finesse through that opponent?|
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The answer is that some “guesses” are better than others. Suppose you choose to play East for the @DQ. You would cash the @DA first (just in case the @DQ fell singleton, ending your problems). Then you lead the @DJ and run it, hoping East has her ladyship. However, when does this play work? If you work it out, in these positions only:|
PG| ***** 166 ***** |


qx||NT||at|
^BWest          ^lEast
^c@D× × × ×     ^m@DQ
^c@DQ           ^m@D× × × ×
^c@D× ×         ^m@DQ × ×
^c@D× × ×       ^m@DQ ×|
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Note that you will fail to make four tricks if Diamonds are 4-1 with East having length. It is an important point this and needs careful consideration. If the Eastern opponent has @DQ 9 × × he can foil any plans you have by covering the @DJ with the @DQ. This way he will promote his @D9 into winning rank and hold you to three Diamond tricks.|
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now look at the alternative. Suppose you choose to play West for the @DQ. You cash the @DK first (you never know, the @DQ might appear on this trick, clearing your headache) and play a Diamond to the @D10. Now you will make four tricks whenever the Diamonds are divided in the following way:|
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


NT||at|
^bWest          ^lEast
^c@D× × × ×     ^m@DQ
^c@DQ           ^m@D× × × ×
^c@DQ ×         ^m@D× × ×
^c@DQ × ×       ^m@D× ×
^c@DQ × × ×     ^m@D×|
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


NT|^B@2
And you will make four tricks even if West has all five Diamonds (unlikely, given that he didn’t lead one).|
PG| ***** 171 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Since there are more layouts where you will be successful when West has the @DQ than when East has it you should play West for the Queen (and ignore partner’s pained expression when East does turn up with that card and the finesse fails. This is a percentage play, remember, not a sure thing).|
PG| ***** 172 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Put another way, you can cater for a 4-1 break when West has the four Diamonds but not if East has them. So the finesse through West is the percentage play, picking up four Diamond tricks just over 50% of the time.|
PG| ***** 173 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Playing the Diamonds the other way needs East to hold the @DQ and for Diamonds to break 3-2, reducing your chances to about 35%.|
