^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I guess another way to play it is to hope for either the spade finesse or club finesse to work. So I draw 2 rounds of trump if the spade finesse works, and end up with 3 diamonds, 4 spades, 2 clubs and a club ruff.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if spade finesse does not work, then hope club finesse works. So kiwi came up with what was probably a better way to play the hand. Playing for one of the black suit honors to be onside is probably the best way to play the hand.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Anyway I luckily made the hand with my inferior plan :). The big point on that hand was to bid 4@S over 2@S. Remember if you use Bergen hand evaluation you will bid many games that other pairs won't bid.|

PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It works as follows. Over a 1N or 2N opener or rebid, if you bid 4@D that is RKCB for clubs. If you bid 4@C that is RKCB for diamonds. Note that if you play this, you cannot play Gerber  (since 4C is RKCB for diamonds) nor Texas (since 4@D is RKCB for clubs).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Let me explain it and have Judy try it, just for fun. I don't play Texas or Gerber over 1N or 2N. I play that over 1N or 2N, if  responder jumps to 4@C that is RKCB for diamonds. If responder jumps to 4@D that is RKCB for clubs. So lets try that. Bid 4@D Judy.|mb|4D|mb|p|NT||cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|kiwi brings up a good question which is appropriate for this hand—playing 3@S to transfer to minors.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are several other variations, but the one I think is the easiest and makes the most sense is the 3@S is a slam try in an unspecified minor suit. The play of 3@S forces 3N by the 2N bidder and then responder bids their minor. |
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if we played that, Judy would bid 3@S, I would bid 3N and she would bid 4@C and we look for slam. |
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If she had diamonds instead of clubs she would bid 4@D. After that you can start control bidding once the minor suit is established.|

From ACBL Bulletin "The Bidding ToolKit" and input by Howard Schutzman


^-|cp||HT|e|cp||fp||va|4|at|^B@2Puppet Stayman is a version of regular Stayman popularly used in response to a 2NT opening bid or rebid. A 2N opener shows a balanced 20/12 HCP but takes up a lots of bidding room. Also, many of those hands have a five-card major. To avoid missing a 5–3 major-suit fit many pairs use ^*BPuppet Stayman^*N.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


AT|

To show how it works let us assume partner opens 2N, the next opponents is silent, and you have a hand worth bidding. (In the bidding box we have removed the passes.)

BTW, playing ^*BPuppet Stayman^*N, you can still play Jacoby and Texas transfers over a 2NT opening. The treatments are compatible. Puppet Stayman is Alertable.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand looks like a big misfit to me. I could bid 1N but on misfits I prefer the opponents play it. In Match Points scoring (face to face bridge) I would probably pass because if we beat 1@S one trick, we get 200 which is probably close to a top board for us. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In IMPs it is not as clear. if I thought it was unlikely that they were making overtricks I still might pass because even if they make it is only 60 for the tricks, 50 for the part score and 50 for making the doubled contract (the so called "insult") which is only 160 not that big a score. |

A Short History of Nearly Everything 
Copyright © 2003 by Bill Bryson
}^-|fp||ht|g|va|4|at|^B@2The basic working arrangement of atoms is the molecule (from the Latin for “little mass”). A molecule is simply two or more atoms working together in a more or less stable arrangement: add two atoms of hydrogen to one of oxygen and you have a molecule of water. Chemists tend to think in terms of molecules rather than elements in much the way that writers tend to think in terms of words and not letters, so it is molecules they count, and these are numerous to say the least. At sea level, at a temperature of 32 degrees Fahrenheit, one cubic centimeter of air (that is, a space about the size of a sugar cube) will contain ^*B45 billion billion molecules^*N. And they are in every single cubic centimeter you see around you. Think how many cubic centimeters there are in the world outside your window—how many sugar cubes it would take to fill that view. Then think how many it would take to build a universe. Atoms, in short, are very abundant.|
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


AT| 

They are also fantastically durable. Because they are so long lived, atoms really get around. Every atom you possess has almost certainly passed through several stars and been part of millions of organisms on its way to becoming you. We are each so atomically numerous and so vigorously recycled at death that a significant number of our atoms—up to a billion for each of us, it has been suggested—probably once belonged to Shakespeare. A billion more each came from Buddha and Genghis Khan and Beethoven, and any other historical figure you care to name—(^*BMM: a world class bridge player no doubt^*N). (The personages have to be historical, apparently, as it takes the atoms some decades to become thoroughly redistributed; however much you may wish it, you are not yet one with Elvis Presley.) |
PG| ***** 178 ***** |


AT|

So we are all reincarnations—though short-lived ones. When we die our atoms will disassemble and move off to find new uses elsewhere—as part of a leaf or other human being or drop of dew. Atoms, however, go on practically forever. Nobody actually knows how long an atom can survive, but according to Martin Rees it is probably about 10 to the power 35 years—a number so big that even I am happy to express it in notation.|

^*BJazz^*N  
Over its hundred-year history jazz has traveled from the streets of New Orleans to the concert halls of Japan. The musical style that began as a derivation of Louisiana ragtime grew into the big-band swing of the 1920s and 30s, improvisational bebop beginning in the 40s, and finally to jazz fusion, a mixture of jazz, funk, and R&B. But unlike other musical mediums, every movement in jazz is still thriving to this day. So "drum on your drums...sob on the long cool winding saxophones. Go to it, O jazzmen!"

^*BHip^*N  
The word hip (originally spelled "hep") describes someone who is "in the know" or "in tune" with the latest style. This usage of hip gained popularity around 1905, and in jazz it refers to the "cool" demeanor of talented musicians or informed listeners. While hip also denotes the pelvis, hip and hep have been the accepted names for "the fruit of the wild rose" or "rose hips" from as early as 725 BCE. But whether it's a rose or a song, in the words of legendary saxophonist Cannonball Adderley: "^*Bhipness is not a state of mind, it's a fact of life.^*N"|

^*BHepcat  
In 1938 bandleader Cab Calloway released The Hepster's Dictionary, in which he defined the word hepcat as a guy or gal "who knows what it's all about." A portmanteau of hep and cat, the word came to represent both lovers of the music and jazz musicians themselves. But by the late 1950s it was shortened to "cat" alone in common usage, and a decade later "cat" was documented as the accepted title when the jazz giant, pianist Thelonious Monk first heard revolutionary saxophonist Ornette Coleman; "Man, that cat is nuts!" Monk said.|

^*BDig^*N
When a jazz musician really identifies with a tune or a jazz devotee discovers a new sound, you can say they dig the music. In the sixth edition of The Hepster's Dictionary Cab Calloway defines "dig," as "to comprehend, to understand," using the example: "Do you dig this jive?" (with "jive" referring to music). But in jazz, "to understand" is often synonymous with "to enjoy" and dig can point to love just as easily as mastery.|

If you've ever seen a jazz musician blush after being told they've got chops, it's not because they have something in their teeth. The word refers to musical skill or ability. In bebop, chops implies not only the stamina necessary to keep up with the style's lightning-fast melodies, but the ability to successfully improvise within a bebop tune. And in the words of bandleader Duke Ellington, bringing your chops to a session is as vital as bringing your instrument because "playing [bebop] is like playing Scrabble with all the vowels missing."|

^*BScat singing^*N
Jazz vocalists love to solo, but that might not be the case if a singer had to invent new lyrics when he or she wanted to riff. Enter scat singing. Scat style substitutes words with nonsense syllables allowing vocalists to improvise in the style of a musical instrument. Trumpeter Louis Armstrong is rumored to have invented scat when he dropped his lyric sheet during a performance, but bandleader Jelly Roll Morton contested this claim, citing comedian Joe Sims as the first man who ever did a scat number in the history of this country.|

^*BIn the pocket^*N
When a tune is really grooving and everyone in the room feels the beat in their bones, or when a jazz musician falls into a rhythm like he's falling into his mother's arms, you can say he's in the pocket. The term refers to a unified understanding of rhythmic time among musicians. Though there is little etymological evidence, Freddie Green's 1956 composition "Corner Pocket" has led many to believe that the term originated in pool playing vernacular, as in "I'm going to sink the eight ball in the corner pocket." |
