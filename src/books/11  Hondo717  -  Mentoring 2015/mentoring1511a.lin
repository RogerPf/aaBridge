^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Defense is very hard and any help you can give partner is a bonus. You also need to pay attention to my carding. At trick 6 I led a low spade back meaning I had 3 remaining. So if I started with 4, you started with 3, dummy started with 3 and West started with 2. Therefore you should lead a diamond back—the @D10.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since West was nice enough to play the D9. Not to mention you know West has at most 1 diamond left, since I started with at least 3. Counting is another skill that is crucial when defending. 2 very important things you should do on defense is to card correctly and count.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |

brains88:  I know, but I have no @S or @D stoppers so if P has no @D we are in 4@C.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That's true but you have 8 tricks. If partner has a diamond stopper you have 9 tricks. It turns out even if I lead a spade, which is probably what I do, we can only take 2 diamonds and 2 spades at most. Again, I didn't think of it at the time but 3@D is a very good bid. Partner showed values by bidding 2@H.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And BTW, that is why 3@D by Judy is more effective. It is now much harder to get to the best contract for E/W. Regardless, Ben, it was a good thought by you :) something I did not think of but should have.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A weak 2 in 3rd seat is not a bad tactic, especially not vul against vul. I prefer, with a 5-card suit, to have a singleton, but you have to bid the cards you are dealt.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So 2@H in 3rd seat is quite reasonable as is 3@H over 3@C. It turns out we have a spade fit, but I am not sure how many tricks we take.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@H by Judy is a reverse. Bidding over reverses is a very difficult topic. Bergen calls reverse auctions "a maybe-ville auction." That is because although Judy has shown a nice hand, she has not shown a game forcing hand (forcing 1 round for sure) and it is hard to tell whether or not to force to game. On some hands Ben will have 9 points or so and will want to force to game, but on others, like this hand, he will have a weaker hand.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, although Judy is almost promising 16 or so, she often can have a stronger hand and would like to force to game. So the auction can get very sticky. However, I have come up with what I think is a simple scheme. I suggest you try it in your partnerships. It works as follows:|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If responder bids anything but the 4th suit (3@C in this game) he/she is denying a game forcing hand. Now opener knows whether or not they are in a game forcing auction and can bid accordingly. If opener has 18+ they can bid game, with less than 18 they want to stop in a partial.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is the crux of my system. Essentially 4th suit forcing to game. I have one other optional rule. And that is that the partnership cannot stop below 2NT. But so long as you play the 4th suit convention, the 2N style is optional.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case, Ben should bid 3@D which shows diamond support but a hand too weak to force to game.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


AT|
brains88:  So even if I had @H KJ9 you would want me to bid 3@C rather than showing a 5-card Spades suit.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|To answer Ben's question, however, given Judy has shown 9 or more cards in the red suits, it is somewhat unlikely she has 3 spades and you have a sure diamond fit and a weak hand, and even if she has 3 spades, unless they are strong 3@D is probably a better contract. Further, a 5-3 fit is probably better. BTW, lots of people play 2N by Ben as Lebensohl but I do not like that system at all.|

PG| ***** 84 ***** |


AT| Certainly looking at the East/West cards I want to be in 5@D. But I would not bid it with Judy's hand. Ben has the perfect hand, with @HJ10 and a doubleton club. Take away even the @H10 and it is an iffy game. Not to mention he could have easily had 3 clubs. So although it is a game you would like to be in, I think it is hard to get there.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|A diamond can't be right - if partner had this card, she would have cashed the @DA before returning the @HJ to clear up the defense for us. Why would she do this?|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Because from her perspective, if she had the @DA then she can see four defensive tricks: @HK, @DA, @HJ to your queen, and a heart ruff (or the @H10). If that is the case, cashing the @DA would clear up the situation for us.|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A corollary to this is that if our partner does not cash the @DA before returning a heart (like here), then we can be very sure that there is no side ace to be cashed, and we would have to look elsewhere for our defense. Therefore, our only remaining defense is playing a heart.|

NT|^B@2
Opening Lead: @HK - always good to lead from a strong sequence holding. |
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Play: You lead the @HK in which your partner overtakes it with the ace, and returns the jack. You should return the favor by overtaking the jack (since partner's play indicates a doubleton heart), then play the @H10.|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Your @H10 holds as your partner discards a discouraging club. |

Where's the fourth trick going to come from? |
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Well, a diamond can't be right - if partner had this card, she would have cashed the @DA before returning the @HJ to clear up the defense for us. Why would she do this if that were the case? |
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Because from her perspective, if she had the @DA then she can see four defensive tricks: @HK, @DA, @HJ to your queen, and a heart ruff (or the @H10). By taking the @DA, it would clear up the defensive situation for us. |
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A corollary to this is that if our partner does not cash the @DA before returning a heart (like here), then we can be very sure that there is no side ace to be cashed, and we would have to look elsewhere for our defense. |
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Therefore, our only remaining defense here is via a trump promotion. Once you determine that NO tricks are coming from any side suit(s), look to the trump suit for relief. |
PG| ***** 140 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Consider uppercut possibilities with trump holdings that can be promoted if our partner can trump something with a high enough trump. This may mean giving declarer a ruff and a discard but that would be useless for him. |
PG| ***** 141 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Here, partner has the singleton @SK and if she remembers to trump the fourth heart with the @SK then our @S10 will be promoted! Note that even a singleton @SJ would be enough for a trump promotion as well. |

%%%Leading Against NT Contract: Five tricky questions by Linda J. Green

^-|
HT|d|cp||cs||fp||va|4|at|^B@2The single most important moment in a deal of bridge is the opening lead. It is a unique card played without a sight of dummy. It is very important to listen to the bidding to guide us to make certain choices. |
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


AT|

What was the bidding of the opponents?
Did partner bid?
How many tricks do you need to defeat the contract?|
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


AT|

In a No Trump contract it is a race between you, the defender or the declarer. The best defense is therefore to lead a long suit in anticipation to set up that suit.|
PG| ***** 146 ***** |


AT|

Exception: When we have no "High Card Points" (HCP) try to lead your shortest suit to find partner with length who will have the remainder of the points. After all Xmas will come before you set up a topless suit!! |

ht|k|at|^B@24@H is the correct answer. Here is a race. They did not bid a major. The heart suit is too anemic to overcall with no suit quality. The best defense is to lead the longest suit as there are many entries to set up the heart suit. The club suit will provide you entries each time.|

ht|k|at|^B@2@SJ is the correct answer. When declarer denies a 4-card major, declarer usually has length in the minors. Having the ten in spades makes it a safe lead - top of a sequence. |

ht|k|at|^B@2@H7 is the correct answer. When they do not bid Stayman we should think of leading a major. Leading a low heart promises an honor asking partner to return the suit. When we have no honor, it is best to lead the second highest of our longest major to show no interest . |

You have to have a very good reason to lead your own suit! They say if your partner does not lead your suit get a new bridge partner!! We overcall for a lead - not to buy the contract.|
