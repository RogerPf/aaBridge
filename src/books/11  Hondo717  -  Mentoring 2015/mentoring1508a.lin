dirtysox88: East has a clear cut double over 1 club, as a passed hand.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And dirtysox is right. East should make a takeout double over 1@C especially given she is a passed hand. Even if she were not a passed hand, with 4-4 in the majors I would double in which case I think they get to 3@H. Then I am not sure we would then bid 4@C. 4 over 3 is rarely right, although it happened to be right on this hand.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, I like to mention is that east/west have a nice heart partial. They make 3 hearts, losing 1 heart, 1 diamond and 2 spades. West might consider making a takeout double over my 1@S bid given she is a passed hand, although it is not clear we have a fit yet.|

^B@2^*BMM: We have tried to make the bidding and the play as it happened. As you already know the table is a teaching table and Howard is the only one who can see the four hands. On occasions the process reaches high enough level which is over our bridge head. So we ask Howard for help when we do the movie. This board is a good example. Make sure you read MM's quandary and Howard's responses.^*N|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think Faye wants to be in game, but she feels (correctly IMO) her hand is not quite strong enough to bid 2N or 4@C. She has a "3.75@H" bid. So what you can do with those hands is bid a Bergen limit raise to limit your hand, but then bid 4@H even if Opener bids only 3@H.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|that says you have a barely game forcing hand which is exactly what Faye has. With her hand I would bid 3@C intending to bid 4@H if pard only bid 3@H.|mb|3C!|an|10/ 12 pts support|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let me look at my and and count my Bergen Declarer Points. I have 16 HCP, 2 length points, 1 quality suit point for 19 starting points. I add 2 for the singleton and 1 for the 6th heart when we found a fit for a total of 22. That means we are in the slam range. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, I am going to bid 3@S. I want to look for slam if we have a diamond control. 3@S is forcing to game, is looking for slam, and showing 1st or 2nd round control in spades|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, I am worried about diamonds so I bid 4@H. Faye should realize that I am worried about diamonds. Having said that, she knows I don't have the @DK. With diamond control I would have bid 4@D.|mb|4H|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is likely we have a diamond loser. Faye bids 4N and once we are missing 1 key card she should stop in 5. This is a rare case where you should stop in 5 even though you are missing only 1 key card.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


NT||AT|^B@2
MM: I bid 6@H with North hand. We have control in all suits as far as I am concerned. We miss one keycard but I have the trump queen. Of course  when I see my partner's hand I know my bid was not so great. But I followed the conventional wisdom. So, let us see what Hayward comments—via email.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This was a more sophisticated slam bidding sequence than I usually like to discuss. But I thought it was interesting enough that it was worth discussing.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|MM is correct. The rule you should use is that, once you determine you have enough points to bid slam and use RKCB, you should then proceed to slam if you have all 5 key cards or 4 key cards and the trump queen.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Using that rule, on this hand, since North knows that their side has 4 key cards and the trump queen, she should bid slam. And that is the rule you should follow. |
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most students are too timid about bidding slam so that is why I have this rule to give them an easy way to decide whether or not to bid slam once initiating RKCB. It will work almost all the time.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So why did I recommend against bidding slam? I wanted to take the analysis to the next level. In this case, over the 4@C control bid by North, South bid 4@H rather than 4@D. That means South has no diamond control. North know that for sure. However, North does have a diamond control, so slam is still possible. Then North bids 4NT. |
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When South shows 3 key cards, North knows they are missing one key card. North also knows that South has at least 2 diamonds and one of them is not the DK (because of South's failure to control bid 4@D over 4@C). |
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, North knows that they have 2 likely losers on this hand -- the 1 key card they are missing plus a diamond loser. So North stops in 5@H.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is not something I would expect a student to figure out. But I do think it makes sense when it is explained.|

^*BMM: ^*NI understand the second hand low but, for several reasons, I will cash my ace like a shot.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, 2nd hand low would have been right, even on this hand. Remember, South is declarer so in general there is no way for West to know that South has a singleton spade. If, for example, South started with Jxx of spades (unlikely but possible) then by playing 2nd hand low, West would get 2 spade tricks.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, on this particular bidding, West can deduce that South has a singleton spade. Why? Because South made a control bid of 3S. Since West has the @SA and North has the SK, South's control bid must be based on shortness (either a singleton or void). And since South led a spade, it must be a singleton.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it turns out, even if West takes the @SA, the South can throw a diamond on the @SK and still make the hand. So not taking the @SA simply traded a spade trick for a diamond trick. This is often the case when  you play 2nd hand low.|

THE EARTH MOVES
|fp||at| From "A Short History of Nearly Everything"  by Bill Bryson |CP|1|AT|^*Hen.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Short_History_of_Nearly_Everything^*N|CP||AT|}^-|cs||ht|e|va|6|at|^B@2IN ONE OF his last professional acts before his death in 1955, Albert Einstein wrote a short but glowing foreword to a book by a geologist named Charles Hapgood entitled Earth’s Shifting Crust: ^*IA Key to Some Basic Problems of Earth Science.^*N Hapgood’s book was a steady demolition of the idea that continents were in motion. In a tone that all but invited the reader to join him in a tolerant chuckle, Hapgood observed that a few gullible souls had noticed "an apparent correspondence in shape between certain continents." It would appear, he went on, "that South America might be fitted together with Africa, and so on. . . . It is even claimed that rock formations on opposite sides of the Atlantic match."|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


AT|

Mr. Hapgood briskly dismissed any such notions, noting that the geologists K. E. Caster and J. C. Mendes had done extensive fieldwork on both sides of the Atlantic and had established beyond question that no such similarities existed. Goodness knows what outcrops Messrs. Caster and Mendes had looked at, beacuse in fact many of the rock formations on both sides of the Atlantic are the same—not just very similar but the same.|
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


AT|

This was not an idea that flew with Mr. Hapgood, or many other geologists of his day. The theory Hapgood alluded to was one first propounded in 1908 by an amateur American geologist named Frank Bursley Taylor. Taylor came from a wealthy family and had both the means and freedom from academic constraints to pursue unconventional lines of inquiry. He was one of those struck by the similarity in shape between the facing coastlines of Africa and South America, and from this observation he developed the idea that the continents had once slid around. He suggested—presciently as it turned out—that the crunching together of continents could have thrust up the world’s mountain chains. He failed, however, to produce much in the way of evidence, and the theory was considered too crackpot to merit serious attention.|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


AT|

In Germany, however, Taylor’s idea was picked up, and effectively appropriated, by a theorist named Alfred Wegener, a meteorologist at the University of Marburg. Wegener investigated the many plant and fossil anomalies that did not fit comfortably into the standard model of Earth history and realized that very little of it made sense if conventionally interpreted. Animal fossils repeatedly turned up on opposite sides of oceans that were clearly too wide to swim. How, he wondered, did marsupials travel from South America to Australia? How did identical snails turn up in Scandinavia and New England? And how, come to that, did one account for coal seams and other semi-tropical remnants in frigid spots like Spitsbergen, four hundred miles north of Norway, if they had not somehow migrated there from warmer climes?|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |

Wegener developed the theory that the world’s continents had once come together in a single landmass he called Pangaea, where flora and fauna had been able to mingle, before the continents had split apart and floated off to their present positions. All this he put together in a book called Die Entstehung der Kontinente und Ozeane, or The Origin of Continents and Oceans, which was published in German in 1912 and—despite the outbreak of the First World War in the meantime—in English three years later.|
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


AT|

Because of the war, Wegener’s theory didn’t attract much notice at first, but by 1920, when he produced a revised and expanded edition, it quickly became a subject of discussion. Everyone agreed that continents moved—but up and down, not sideways. The process of vertical movement, known as isostasy, was a foundation of geological beliefs for generations, though no one had any good theories as to how or why it happened. One idea, which remained in textbooks well into my own school days, was the baked apple theory propounded by the Austrian Eduard Suess just before the turn of the century. |
PG| ***** 140 ***** |


AT|

This suggested that as the molten Earth had cooled, it had become wrinkled in the manner of a baked apple, creating ocean basins and mountain ranges. Never mind that James Hutton had shown long before that any such static arrangement would eventually result in a featureless spheroid as erosion leveled the bumps and filled in the divots. There was also the problem, demonstrated by Rutherford and Soddy early in the century, that Earthly elements hold huge reserves of heat—much too much to allow for the sort of cooling and shrinking Suess suggested. And anyway, if Suess’s theory was correct then mountains should be evenly distributed across the face of the Earth, which patently they were not, and of more or less the same ages; yet by the early 1900s it was already evident that some ranges, like the Urals and Appalachians, were hundreds of millions of years older than others, like the Alps and Rockies. Clearly the time was ripe for a new theory. Unfortunately, Alfred Wegener was not the man that geologists wished to provide it.|
PG| ***** 141 ***** |


AT|

For a start, his radical notions questioned the foundations of their discipline, seldom an effective way to generate warmth in an audience. Such a challenge would have been painful enough coming from a geologist, but Wegener had no background in geology. He was a meteorologist, for goodness sake. A weatherman—a German weatherman. These were not remediable deficiencies.|

And so geologists took every pain they could think of to dismiss his evidence and belittle his suggestions. To get around the problems of fossil distributions, they posited ancient "land bridges" wherever they were needed. When an ancient horse named Hipparion was found to have lived in France and Florida at the same time, a land bridge was drawn across the Atlantic. When it was realized that ancient tapirs had existed simultaneously in South America and Southeast Asia a land bridge was drawn there, too. Soon maps of prehistoric seas were almost solid with hypothesized land bridges—from North America to Europe, from Brazil to Africa, from Southeast Asia to Australia, from Australia to Antarctica. These connective tendrils had not only conveniently appeared whenever it was necessary to move a living organism from one landmass to another, but then obligingly vanished without leaving a trace of their former existence. None of this, of course, was supported by so much as a grain of actual evidence—nothing so wrong could be—yet it was geological orthodoxy for the next half century.|
PG| ***** 143 ***** |


AT|

Even land bridges couldn’t explain some things. One species of trilobite that was well known in Europe was also found to have lived on Newfoundland—but only on one side. No one could persuasively explain how it had managed to cross two thousand miles of hostile ocean but then failed to find its way around the corner of a 200-mile-wide island. Even more awkwardly anomalous was another species of trilobite found in Europe and the Pacific Northwest but nowhere in between, which would have required not so much a land bridge as a flyover. Yet as late as 1964 when the Encyclopaedia Britannica discussed the rival theories, it was Wegener’s that was held to be full of "numerous grave theoretical difficulties."|
PG| ***** 144 ***** |

To be sure, Wegener made mistakes. He asserted that Greenland is drifting west by about a mile a year, which is clearly nonsense. (It’s more like half an inch.) Above all, he could offer no convincing explanation for how the landmasses moved about. To believe in his theory you had to accept that massive continents somehow pushed through solid crust, like a plow through soil, without leaving any furrow in their wake. Nothing then known could plausibly explain what motored these massive movements.|

It was Arthur Holmes, the English geologist who did so much to determine the age of the Earth, who suggested a possible way. Holmes was the first scientist to understand that radioactive warming could produce convection currents within the Earth. In theory these could be powerful enough to slide continents around on the surface. In his popular and influential textbook Principles of Physical Geology, first published in 1944, Holmes laid out a ^*Bcontinental drift^*N theory that was in its fundamentals the theory that prevails today. It was still a radical proposition for the time and widely criticized, particularly in the United States, where resistance to drift lasted longer than elsewhere. One reviewer there fretted, without any evident sense of irony, that Holmes presented his arguments so clearly and compellingly that students might actually come to believe them.|
PG| ***** 146 ***** |


AT|

Elsewhere, however, the new theory drew steady if cautious support. In 1950, a vote at the annual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science showed that about half of those present now embraced the idea of continental drift. (Hapgood soon after cited this figure as proof of how tragically misled British geologists had become.) Curiously, Holmes himself sometimes wavered in his conviction. In 1953 he confessed: "I have never succeeded in freeing myself from a nagging prejudice against continental drift; in my geological bones, so to speak, I feel the hypothesis is a fantastic one."|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


AT|

Continental drift was not entirely without support in the United States. Reginald Daly of Harvard spoke for it, but he, you may recall, was the man who suggested that the Moon had been formed by a cosmic impact, and his ideas tended to be considered interesting, even worthy, but a touch too exuberant for serious consideration. And so most American academics stuck to the belief that the continents had occupied their present positions forever and that their surface features could be attributed to something other than lateral motions.|

Interestingly, oil company geologists had known for years that if you wanted to find oil you had to allow for precisely the sort of surface movements that were implied by plate tectonics. But oil geologists didn’t write academic papers; they just found oil.|

There was one other major problem with Earth theories that no one had resolved, or even come close to resolving. That was the question of where all the sediments went. Every year Earth’s rivers carried massive volumes of eroded material—500 million tons of calcium, for instance—to the seas. If you multiplied the rate of deposition by the number of years it had been going on, it produced a disturbing figure: there should be about twelve miles of sediments on the ocean bottoms—or, put another way, the ocean bottoms should by now be well above the ocean tops. Scientists dealt with this paradox in the handiest possible way. They ignored it. But eventually there came a point when they could ignore it no longer.|

In the Second World War, a Princeton University mineralogist named Harry Hess was put in charge of an attack transport ship, the USS Cape Johnson. Aboard this vessel was a fancy new depth sounder called a ^*Bfathometer^*N, which was designed to facilitate inshore maneuvers during beach landings, but Hess realized that it could equally well be used for scientific purposes and never switched it off, even when far out at sea, even in the heat of battle. |
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


AT|

What he found was entirely unexpected. If the ocean floors were ancient, as everyone assumed, they should be thickly blanketed with sediments, like the mud on the bottom of a river or lake. But Hess’s readings showed that the ocean floor offered anything but the gooey smoothness of ancient silts. It was scored everywhere with canyons, trenches, and crevasses and dotted with volcanic seamounts that he called guyots after an earlier Princeton geologist named Arnold Guyot. All this was a puzzle, but Hess had a war to take part in, and put such thoughts to the back of his mind.|
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


AT|

After the war, Hess returned to Princeton and the preoccupations of teaching, but the mysteries of the seafloor continued to occupy a space in his thoughts. Meanwhile, throughout the 1950s oceanographers were undertaking more and more sophisticated surveys of the ocean floors. In so doing, they found an even bigger surprise: the mightiest and most extensive mountain range on Earth was—mostly—underwater. It traced a continuous path along the world’s seabeds, rather like the stitching on a baseball. If you began at Iceland, you could follow it down the center of the Atlantic Ocean, around the bottom of Africa, and across the Indian and Southern Oceans, below Australia; there it angled across the Pacific as if making for Baja California before shooting up the west coast of the United States to Alaska. Occasionally its higher peaks poked above the water as an island or archipelago—the Azores and Canaries in the Atlantic, Hawaii in the Pacific, for instance—but mostly it was buried under thousands of fathoms of salty sea, unknown and unsuspected. When all its branches were added together, the network extended to 46,600 miles.|

A very little of this had been known for some time. People laying ocean-floor cables in the nineteenth century had realized that there was some kind of mountainous intrusion in the mid-Atlantic from the way the cables ran, but the continuous nature and overall scale of the chain was a stunning surprise. Moreover, it contained physical anomalies that couldn’t be explained. Down the middle of the mid-Atlantic ridge was a canyon—a rift—up to a dozen miles wide for its entire 12,000-mile length. This seemed to suggest that the Earth was splitting apart at the seams, like a nut bursting out of its shell. It was an absurd and unnerving notion, but the evidence couldn’t be denied.|
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


AT|

Then in 1960 core samples showed that the ocean floor was quite young at the mid-Atlantic ridge but grew progressively older as you moved away from it to the east or west. Harry Hess considered the matter and realized that this could mean only one thing: new ocean crust was being formed on either side of the central rift, then being pushed away from it as new crust came along behind. The Atlantic floor was effectively two large conveyor belts, one carrying crust toward North America, the other carrying crust toward Europe. The process became known as seafloor spreading.|

When the crust reached the end of its journey at the boundary with continents, it plunged back into the Earth in a process known as subduction. That explained where all the sediment went. It was being returned to the bowels of the Earth. It also explained why ocean floors everywhere were so comparatively youthful. None had ever been found to be older than about 175 million years, which was a puzzle because continental rocks were often billions of years old. Now Hess could see why. Ocean rocks lasted only as long as it took them to travel to shore. It was a beautiful theory that explained a great deal. Hess elaborated his ideas in an important paper, which was almost universally ignored. Sometimes the world just isn’t ready for a good idea.|

Meanwhile, two researchers, working independently, were making some startling findings by drawing on a curious fact of Earth history that had been discovered several decades earlier. In 1906, a French physicist named Bernard Brunhes had found that the planet’s magnetic field reverses itself from time to time, and that the record of these reversals is permanently fixed in certain rocks at the time of their birth. Specifically, tiny grains of iron ore within the rocks point to wherever the magnetic poles happen to be at the time of their formation, then stay pointing in that direction as the rocks cool and harden. In effect they "remember" where the magnetic poles were at the time of their creation. |
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


AT|

For years this was little more than a curiosity, but in the 1950s Patrick Blackett of the University of London and S. K. Runcorn of the University of Newcastle studied the ancient magnetic patterns frozen in British rocks and were startled, to say the very least, to find them indicating that at some time in the distant past Britain had spun on its axis and traveled some distance to the north, as if it had somehow come loose from its moorings. Moreover, they also discovered that if you placed a map of Europe’s magnetic patterns alongside an American one from the same period, they fit together as neatly as two halves of a torn letter. It was uncanny. Their findings were ignored too.|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


AT|

It finally fell to two men from Cambridge University, a geophysicist named Drummond Matthews and a graduate student of his named Fred Vine, to draw all the strands together. In 1963, using magnetic studies of the Atlantic Ocean floor, they demonstrated conclusively that the seafloors were spreading in precisely the manner Hess had suggested and that the continents were in motion too. |

An unlucky Canadian geologist named Lawrence Morley came up with the same conclusion at the same time, but couldn’t find anyone to publish his paper. In what has become a famous snub, the editor of the Journal of Geophysical Research told him: "Such speculations make interesting talk at cocktail parties, but it is not the sort of thing that ought to be published under serious scientific aegis." One geologist later described it as "probably the most significant paper in the earth sciences ever to be denied publication."|

At all events, mobile crust was an idea whose time had finally come. A symposium of many of the most important figures in the field was convened in London under the auspices of the Royal Society in 1964, and suddenly, it seemed, everyone was a convert. The Earth, the meeting agreed, was a mosaic of interconnected segments whose various stately jostlings accounted for much of the planet’s surface behavior.|
PG| ***** 161 ***** |

The name "continental drift" was fairly swiftly discarded when it was realized that the whole crust was in motion and not just the continents, but it took a while to settle on a name for the individual segments. At first people called them "crustal blocks" or sometimes "paving stones." Not until late 1968, with the publication of an article by three American seismologists in the Journal of Geophysical Research, did the segments receive the name by which they have since been known: ^*Bplates^*N. The same article called the new science plate tectonics.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding: 
After South's natural 3NT bid showing 16-17 points and a balanced hand, North would have been wise to remove it to 4@H with six of them and the singleton spade. |
PG| ***** 204 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|@S6 as an opening lead is fine.|
PG| ***** 205 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Play: 
In terms of top tricks, we have a club, four diamonds, and a heart for a total of six. The spade  opening lead will provide us with our seventh trick and we now need to look for two more. |
PG| ***** 206 ***** |


NT|^B@2
There are two possible lines of play. You can either take the heart finesse, or you could cross to dummy with a diamond and take a double club finesse. So which line is better? |
PG| ***** 207 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Well, it actually depends on what had happened on the first trick. Had East won the @SA on the first trick and returned a spade back to our jack losing to West's queen, then we would obviously take the heart finesse since the club suit requires us to lose the lead once (that's if we were aiming to set up three tricks in the club suit).|
PG| ***** 208 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, given East played the @S10 on the first trick (thus marking West with the @SA and @SQ), we must now do everything we can to prevent East (the danger hand) on lead. |
PG| ***** 209 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Luckily, our club suit consists of the 8, 9 and 10. We can take full advantage of this by crossing to dummy with a diamond and run the @C8.|
PG| ***** 210 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Say it loses to West's jack and a heart comes back (best defense). You mustn't take that bait! |
PG| ***** 211 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you do take the heart finesse, this would be (nearly) equivalent as taking a heart finesse at trick 2 (with the additional chance of finding East with both the @CK and @CJ).|
PG| ***** 212 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So rise with dummy's @HA and run the @C10. If East has either club honor, you score three club tricks to go along with four diamonds and two aces. |
PG| ***** 213 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Finding East with a club honor is a 75% play whereas a heart finesse is a 50% play. By finessing a round of clubs and then taking a heart finesse, this essentially improves the 'all-out' heart finesse play from 50% to about 63% (due to the extra chance of finding East with both club honors or a singleton club honor). |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Using 2NT to show a weak hand (this is called a "2nd negative") by responder is very non-standard in the US and is not a good approach. I use 3@C (and I recommend you do) as 2nd negative. Further, using 2N as a 2nd negative is a very theoretically unsound approach because you will often wrong side the contract if your side ends up in 3NT. |
PG| ***** 223 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Normally, I think worrying about "wrong siding" the contract is very overrated, but when there is a 2@C opener, I do think it becomes more important. Hiding the majority of your side's assets from the defenders can be very advantageous.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|Well, that's certainly not the worst hand we've seen, for sure! Plan your play.|
PG| ***** 227 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|With two potential losers in Clubs and one in Diamonds, this contract looks likely to be cold. But of course, if it were that easy, the hand probably wouldn't be here in the first place...!|
PG| ***** 228 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|So - that means you should probably expect a Heart loser! If trumps are 4-1, is it even possible to make ten tricks? Let's win the lead and draw a couple rounds of trumps and see what happens. There's not much point in holding up the @DA.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|Not surprisingly, trumps are 4-1! 
With East's discard, West is the opponent who holds four Hearts. Is there any way to get home from here? Think before you click.|
PG| ***** 232 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|The only possible way would be to play the Club suit for two winners. Of course, we'd love to be able to unblock the @SA and get over to dummy for that @SK, but unfortunately there is just no viable entry to dummy.|
PG| ***** 233 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|What you'd like to do is for West to lead something favorably to you, preferably a Club so that would set up two tricks there for you. How can we end-play West for him to switch to a Club?|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|North’s 2NT was a second negative. Some partnerships prefer to use the cheapest available suit bid for this purpose, to avoid the weak hand ending as declarer in a No-trump contract. |
PG| ***** 254 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|West leads the King of Diamonds against 4@H. You win with the Ace and play two rounds of trumps, East throwing a Spade on the second round. What now?|
PG| ***** 255 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|You must aim to end-play West. Cash the Ace of Spades and lead your remaining Diamond. West wins with the Diamond Jack and has no easy return. A Spade or a Heart would give you an extra trick directly and a Club would allow you to escape for only one loser in that suit.|
PG| ***** 256 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|West can survive for the moment by leading the Queen of Diamonds. You ruff in your hand and then throw West on lead again by playing Queen and another trump. This time West has no escape. A Spade or Diamond exit will bring the dummy to life, so he has to play a Club. |
PG| ***** 257 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|You therefore lose just one Club, one Diamond and a trump, making your game exactly. (If West is an old enemy of yours, you can tell him that a Spade lead would have beaten you!) 

(Editor: because you will then have to play your @DA on thin air and the @D10 will never become a winner).|
