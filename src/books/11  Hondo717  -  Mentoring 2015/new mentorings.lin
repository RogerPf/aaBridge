ht|f|at|There are no later mentoring lin files included inside this version of ^*baaBridge^*n.  There may be more in the lastest version see @-

^f^*Hhttp://rogerpf.com/aaBridge^*n


However the best place to check is the original web source of the mentoring files @-

^f^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge^*n

Once there, scoll down to the very bottom of that (long) page.   There you will see a list of links that look a bit like @-

|cp|1|at|^i^*uAll 20xx Previous Mentoring Sessions^*n|cp||at|


^*bClick^*n on one of those (real) links and a .zip file will start to download (your browser may ask for confirmation).  

Once downloaded, find that .zip file (look in your downloads area?) and  Drag & Drop  it on to any open
^*baaBridge^*n window (like this one).

Or you can unzip that zip file using the normal methods on your computer and then  Drag & Drop  the individual .lin files on to an open ^*baaBridge^*n window (like this one).
