^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My double here shows exactly 4 spades. That is all it shows. It says nothing about clubs. Some of you may have been taught that a negative double promises the other 2 suits. But that is not the modern style.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us talk about how Mary might bid her hand. Her 4@D bid should show around 20 points and superb diamonds. The heart void is very valuable, but her diamonds are not that useful and she bypasses 3NT which is usually not a good idea.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are very few hands where 5 of a minor is a better contract than 3N. So even with a void, Mary should see if 3N is a possible place to play. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And, with this board with 3N contract, it turns out that on a heart lead and heart continuation, if they set up a heart trick for me I will take 4 spades, 1 club, and 1 diamond for sure with 1 or 2 hearts. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If they set up 2 hearts for me, I have time to play the Judy for the @DK and I might make 3N. They have to shift to a club to beat me. So what should Mary bid to keep 3N in play?|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I see 2 choices instead of 4@D bid. Let us go back.|UB|6|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


AT| My choice would be to bid 3@D, although her suit is a little weak for that bid. The other choice, as Mary just suggested is 2@H, which shows a very strong hand, but needs a heart stopper. That would be a fine bid also.|MB|2hp|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I bid 2N over 2@H,|mb|2n|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


AT| and I am not sure if Mary should bid 3N. I personally would bid 3N with Mary's hand, not necessarily because I think it is likely to make but because it is worth the risk.|mb|p3Nppp|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I rarely pass an invitational 2N bid in IMPs. The upside of making 3N is high, with the game bonus. And the only time it is wrong to raise 2N to 3N is when you can make exactly 2N and not 3N because in IMPs the extra under tricks are not that important.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|They are a bit more important when vul, as an extra -100 is 3 IMPs. But non vul they are almost irrelevant. So my philosophy is to almost always raise 2N to 3N because the reward far outweighs the risk on most hands. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Note I am talking about imps in this discussion. Because in IMPs the game bonus is a large amount of IMPs (7 or so vul). In Match Points (face to face bridge) the game bonus is not nearly as important. So there you should only bid game (3N in this case) if you think you are a favorite to make it. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|These days 2N shows 11-12 and is invitational, not forcing. You should either bid 3N or 1@D. I personally am not a big fan of jumping to 3N. More often than not it does turn out to be the best contract.|mb|3N|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But when partner has a very strong hand, which does happen on occasion you have taken up too much bidding room to explore for slam.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Probably the best defense for Mary was to win the @HK, and play 4 rounds of clubs. There really was no reason to duck the heart king. If she plays that way, I think I make 2 at best and might even go down, losing 1 Heart, 3 Clubs, 1 Diamond, and 1 spade.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now Judy has to decide what kind of defense she wants to play. Passive or aggressive. The safest play is to continue with another diamond. Making declarer ruff rarely costs you a trick and may make declarer run out of trump prematurely. |
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And on this hand, since Judy has a singleton heart, and the most likely number of hearts I have is 6 she knows trumps could be breaking 4-1. So making me ruff might prematurely run me out of trump which is another good reason to make declarer ruff.|pc|CT|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The main point here is do not be afraid to make declarer ruff. at worst it is usually a neutral defense, and it might even run declarer out of trump.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I need to guess the spades in order to make more or hope clubs are 3-3. If anyone is likely to be short in clubs it is Judy because she has shown 5 diamonds so she has fewer cards than Mary in the other suits. |
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


NT||lc|CAKQHKJT9|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I could try for a 3-3 break in clubs or hope that I am making whoever has 2 clubs ruff with a natural trump trick. I think I will just draw turnip and hope I can get an extra black suit winner.|

fp||cp||ht|e|at|^B@2^*BHair of the dog that bit you^*N
This peculiar expression is used to refer to a remedy that contains a small amount of whatever caused the ailment, such as a drink of liquor to relieve a hangover. The phrase reflects an ancient practice of putting a piece of dog's hair, sometimes cooked into an ointment, over a dog-bite wound to help prevent infection.|

This cautionary expression is used to advise against actions that might cause problems or complexities in an otherwise satisfactory situation. The premise at play here seems to be that dogs might bite or snarl if their naps are cut short—an impulse to which many of us can relate.|

This expression refers to a topsy-turvy state of affairs, wherein a small part is guiding the whole, rather than the other way around. The 1997 film Wag the Dog riffs on this theme of role reversal, telling the story of a political spin doctor and a Hollywood film director who join forces to reshape public opinion by producing a fake war.|

Teach an old dog new tricks, which is commonly prefaced with you can't, is used to allude to the difficulty of altering established habits. The expression was likely informed by a passage on elderly pooches from a book of husbandry published in 1523: "The dogge must lerne it whan he is a whelpe or els it wyll not be, for it is harde to make an olde dogge to stoupe."|

These days, the dog is commonly referred to as man's best friend and enjoys an elevated status in society. But centuries ago, the common canine was lower on the totem pole. This phrase reflects that status and is used to mean "even the most humble and low will sometimes come first."|

ht|m|at|^B@2
The answer is Redouble: A redouble means so much. First, it tends to show interest in possibly penalizing the opponents. It also shows an intermediate or better hand (10-plus points). Opener is expected to initially pass, forcing the opponents to bid, which is perfect. If They bid Hearts or Clubs, we penalty double and defend. If West bids Diamonds, we can take it from there. Redoubles and the follow-up bids can be complicated, but just think it through slowly. They are HUGELY threatening to the opponents. Happy Halloween! |

The answer is 1@H: You've got the points for a Redouble (10-plus) but should still bid Hearts. A Redouble might allow the opponents to bid and raise Spades and we won't be able to bid our Hearts and maybe show Diamond support later. We can show our strength later by bidding again. Remember, a Redouble implies interest in penalizing, and we don't want that if they are in a Spade partscore. Better to bid our suit.

ht|k|at|^B@2
The answer is 5@C: Such pressure! For Pard to double a three-level pre-empt, he's gotta have a nice hand, leaning primarily toward the majors. Sadly, he doesn't have a five-card major or he would have bid it. A leap to five of a minor shows our long, powerful suit. Pard is providing the points, we are providing the suit. |
PG| ***** 176 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although 5@C is not completely unreasonable, I think 4@C is a better bid. Although you have a nice club suit, you otherwise have flat distribution. And partner assumes that, on average, you have around 8 points so you rnumber of HCP is not much higher than average.|

We've got a serious decision on the opening lead. We need to decide whether to lead the singleton Spade or our @DA. When one makes a pre-emptive bid and leads another suit, it is assumed that the lead is indeed a singleton. |

Unwrap that Hershey bar while we talk, would you? Let's look at this first from the declarer's point of view. He sees two Diamond losers off the top. Then once he's on lead, he's gonna pull the trumps (successfully unless there's a 4-0 split) and can't lose another trick. |
PG| ***** 202 ***** |


NT|^B@2
BUT!! We paid to play and we have some tricks up our sleeves (to earn our treats!). Pard's play on tricks 1 and 2 give us a count on the suit. At trick 3, we know the game is over, unless we can earn a trump uppercut. What's that? |
PG| ***** 203 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If we can find Pard in North with ANY Club honor, our @C10 can grow up. We have heard over and over, "Don't give them a ruff and sluff" but that is such bad advice.|
PG| ***** 204 ***** |


NT|^B@2
When it is obvious you have no tricks in side suits (you have looked at the dummy, haven't you?), sometimes you can promote a trump. |
PG| ***** 205 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now, Pard has a job to do also. When someone is giving a ruff and sluff, your job is to play the highest trump you have. Why on earth would Pard give them a trick like that unless it is to promote a card?|
PG| ***** 206 ***** |


NT|^B@2
North has no choice, but he does have the key card, and when he plays the @CJ, we know the hand is over. Our @C10 is now a winner. The declarer has to either overtrump or let Pard take the trick. Like THAT'S gonna happen. Either way, we win. |
