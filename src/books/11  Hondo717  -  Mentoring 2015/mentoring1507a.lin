^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The club bids by Shirley were not necessarily natural. Shirley was a bit lucky here. Had she ruffed the first club, the 4-1 diamond break would not have been an issue. But by taking the first club in her hand, she ended up with a possible club loser had spades not broken.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Shirley should ruff the club lead. Then she is just about guaranteed to make 6 and will make 7 if diamonds break.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Should they be in grand slam? It is on a 3-2 break. Basically you only want to be in a grand slam that is about 70%. A 3-2 break is 68%. So, in general, bidding a grand slam is a break even proposition on this hand.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Without getting into the math, here is the reasoning as to why you should only bid grand slams that are a very likely to succeed. Whenever you bid a small slam you will probably do better than average. So when you bid a grand slam, you are risking a good result for either a really good result or a very bad result.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you can get a sure good result, why risk a bad result when you don't have to? I am not saying don't bid grand slams, because they are very exciting when they make.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But mathematically, if you never bid a grand slam, you will come out ahead in the scoring. This hand is a good example. Most people would be upset if their side was not in a grand slam. But it goes down. So the pairs who only bid 6 do much better.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Shirley is playing coded 10s. The standard lead from her holding is the Jack. But most better players prefer what is called coded 10s. That means when you lead the 10 you either have no higher, or, more likely you have a broken sequence with the J10. If Shirley has the J10, in general she has either AJ10 or KJ10.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Before I lead back a heart so Shirley can cash her 2 hearts, I am going to lead back the DA to make sure we set the hand. Otherwise it is possible that Tom could take 9 tricks in the black suits—not likely. But he could have 5 clubs and end up taking 5 clubs and 4 spades if I don't cash the @DA. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally, with a weak hand and a singleton heart, I would pass 2@H the vast majority of the time. It is the same theory as what I said about Sue's pass. When you sense a misfit, stop as soon as you can. However, with a 7 card suit, even a weak one, it is ok to rebid it. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Partner rarely has a void, so it is likely we have an 8-card fit and sometimes we will have a 9-card fit. On a real good day we might have a 10-card fit.|

PG| ***** 103 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good question. Let's analyze it. Sue opened and I responded. So it is likely we have at least close to 20 points. Given light openers these days maybe as little as 16 or 17 but most likely closer to at least 20. |
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it turns out, both of us have just about the smallest number of HCP we could have (Sue has 11 and I have 5) but that is rare. You should assume at least 18 or 19 min between our hands. So say we have 18. Tom has 16. that means partner has 6 at most. Therefore, it is unlikely East has a lot of points and could have very few. Then, bidding 1NT when both opponents have bid is dangerous.|
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What many good players play is that 1NT after both opponents have bid is what is called a "sandwich NT." It is like a takeout double for the other 2 suits, but tends to show a weaker hand with usually the minor being better than the major. With a regular opening hand and the other 2 suits, Tom could make a takeout double. |
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the sandwich NT, if you play it, shows a weaker sort of takeout double. Even if you don't play sandwich NT, and play that 1N shows a strong NT, you need to be cautious about bidding that on this auction when both opponents have bid. Because you could easily be in big trouble. On the other hand, not vul against vul opponents, assuming Tom was not playing sandwich NT, 1NT would be ok as a descriptive bid.|

Ever wonder what might happen if a python ate a porcupine? Well, wonder no more. One of these giant snakes — which kill prey by suffocating it and then consuming it whole — recently dined on a porcupine and didn't live to brag about it. On June 14, a cyclist riding along one of the mountain bike trails at the Lake Eland Game Reserve in KwaZulu-Natal, |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.lakeeland.co.za/^*N|CP||AT| South Africa, spotted a very engorged snake. The cyclist snapped a few photos of the gluttonous python and posted them to social media, where they quickly attracted the attention of locals who wanted to see the python themselves. Lots of people came to the park in the following days just to view the swollen snake, according to Jennifer Fuller, general manager at the game reserve.|

At the time the photos were taken, no one knew what the snake had eaten, just that it must have been something fairly large. On the Lake Eland Game Reserve Facebook page |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.facebook.com/lakeelandgamereserve^*N|CP||AT|, park staff and visitors speculated as to what the snake may have swallowed for dinner, suggesting everything from a small warthog to a baby impala to an errant child (that last one was posted as a joke).|

But on Saturday, June 20, park rangers found the python dead near the bike trail. They decided to cut it open and have a look inside. What they found was one heck of a snack: a ^*B30-lb.^*N (13.8 kilograms) porcupine.|

It isn't unusual for pythons to eat porcupines, Fuller told Live Science in an email. In fact, many species of snakes eat porcupines and other horned or quilled animals, according to a study published in 2003 in the Phyllomedusa Journal of Herpetology. And while a 30-lb. meal might sound like too much to digest, it isn't if you're a python.|

As Fuller noted, pythons in the Lake Eland Game Reserve have been spotted consuming even larger prey, including adult oribi antelope, which can weigh nearly 50 lbs. (22.7 kg). Pythons possess the incredible ability to alter their metabolism, as well as the size of their organs, after a meal. This allows the a python to digest prey that is much larger than the snake is, according to a study published in 2013 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.|

It still isn't clear if this python's spiky meal was actually responsible for the predator's death. Rangers found the snake underneath a rocky ledge, where it had apparently fallen. On impact, the quills inside its engorged belly may have pierced the python's digestive tract, which could have killed the animal, Fuller said.|

In the 2003 study, entitled "Prickly food: snakes preying upon porcupines," researchers found that when a snake eats a porcupine, the animal's quills are left undigested and are easily detectable in the snake's gut. Sometimes, the quills will even pierce all the way through the snake's body, according to the study. But there's no word yet on whether this particular snake died because it was pierced by quills or because it fell off a ledge (or because it was pierced by quills as a result of falling off the ledge), Fuller told the Australian news website News.com.

Rangers at the reserve stripped off the python's skin after removing the porcupine from the predator's digestive track. They also took measurements of the snake's massive body, which was ^*B12.8 feet^*N (3.9 meters) long. Special attention was paid to the animal's head, which features a highly flexible jaw that allows the animal to open its mouth wide to swallow prey whole. Below is a Python swallowed a crock.|

Despite popular belief, a python's jaw does not actually dislocate when the snake is eating. The two lower jaws move independently of one another, and the quadrate bone at the back of the head attaches the jaw loosely to the skull, allowing the jaw to move around freely.|

Bidding and the opening lead were OK. Play:
After two rounds of clubs, it is evident that West has led away from a doubleton. Knowing that you still have to lose another club and a spade, at first it appears that the contract hinges upon the location of the @HK. |
PG| ***** 187 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, you can go for an extra chance. You first lead a low spade from your hand towards dummy's jack. On this deal, West will err by not rising with the @SA in order to switch to a heart. Once West ducks the spade, you can now take full advantage of that error by (partially) stripping out the diamonds. |
PG| ***** 188 ***** |


NT|^B@2
East only had three diamonds so by playing off the @DA, @DK and a diamond ruff, you can then exit a club to East's jack to endplay him. What can poor East do now?|
PG| ***** 189 ***** |


AT| A heart is unthinkinable, and a club return gives us a ruff-and-discard. |
PG| ***** 190 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Take note that with a side suit of doubleton A Q facing two small (i.e. A Q opposite x x), the last thing you want to do is to take that finesse. Instead, try something else first and if that doesn't work, you can always go back to that finesse as a last resort.|

Luckily we have kept the @S10 intact, so we can now cross over there with it to ruff the last Diamond!|

NT|^B@2Comment: 
North’s raise of the weak 2@S to game was on the ambitious side. He might instead have bid 2NT to enquire further about partner’s hand. How would you play 4@S when West leads the six of trumps?|

Declarer saw that he would need the Ace of Hearts to be onside. Even if this were the case, he would still have to worry about the fourth round of Hearts. A 3-3 heart break would rescue him. So would a 2-2 trump break, since he would then be able to ruff the fourth round of Hearts in the dummy.|

In case neither major suit broke favourably, declarer embarked on a different track – a dummy reversal. After winning the trump lead in his hand, he crossed to the Ace of Diamonds and ruffed a Diamond low.|

He then led a Heart to the Queen and King. When he ruffed a Diamond high, West showed out. A Club to the Ace permitted another high Diamond ruff and declarer returned to dummy with the ten of trumps to ruff dummy’s last Diamond high. Nine tricks were before him and dummy’s Ace of trumps made ten.|

NT|^B@2
To gain a trick by reversing the dummy you need to ruff in the long-trump hand until it has fewer trumps than the short-trump hand. Since trumps started 6-3 here, declarer needed to take four ruffs in the long-trump hand. He would then score three side-suit winners, three trump tricks and four ruffs. A total of ten! |
