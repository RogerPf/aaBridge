^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss both the bidding and play. As it was alerted my double was a support double. Many people play "support doubles" in competition. Some people overdo the concept, but here is the easiest way to play them. Opener will double, as I did here, when the auction goes 1x-P-1 of a major-overcall and you do play support double with 3-card support for responder's major—no upper limit as to strength. |
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I had bid 2@H, that would promise 4-card support. Now, you may be wondering, shouldn't 2@H always promise 4 card support. The answer is no. In fact, on this hand, had Stan not overcalled, e.g 1C-P-1H-P-?, I would have bid 2@H. Yes many of you would have bid 1@S. But with such bad spades and such nice hearts, I think 2@H is a better bid. 2@H tends to show 4, but can and often is done with good 3-card support, especially with a singleton or weak doubleton.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One more thing about support doubles. If the auction goes 1C-P-1S-dbl-redbl that is a "support redouble" again showing 3-card support.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|^B@2
TwstofLime:  What to do in this situation if I have only 4 hearts and you double?|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you only had 4 hearts, and had the same 4 clubs, you should bid 3@C. But sometimes you are forced to rebid 2@H and play in a 4-3 fit. That is no different than if Stan  passed and I bid 2@H.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You prefer not to play in a 4-3 fit, but it is not the end of the world, especially at the 2-level. In fact, yesterday, my wife Ava played 2@D in a 4-2 fit and made 3 :).|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, the reason playing spades, by Stan  at trick 5, was a good play was that it ran Sandy out of trump. Remember, it is at worst a neutral play to make declarer trump (since she can do so anyway), and sometimes it can run her out of trump prematurely.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally it is not a good idea to lead unprotected aces. But in this case, it is clear Stan is very short of diamonds and he may be able to throw it off somewhere. So the lead of the unprotected ace is justified.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have been asked, "Is the Ace of diamonds considered unprotected, since partner has supported the suit and probably has the king?"|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|"Unprotected" means I don't have the @DK and if partner supports, he often has the king. So leading the ace is less risky.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The play was fine. Ann's double was fine. She would like to have a slightly better hand. I would have bid 1@S over 1@C had South passed. So double is ok.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Sandy made a very nice LOTT bid of 4 diamonds. We had a 10-card fit, so by the Law it is safe to bid 4@D—a 10 trick contract.|

PG| ***** 59 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|texall makes a good suggestion. Stan  might try 4 hearts rather than 5@C.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|5@C rates to be safer, but often 4 of a major makes where 5 of a minor does not just like on this hand. In that case Sandy would be bidding "5 over 4" which is better than "5 over 5."|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But once Stan bids 5@C, Sandy should pass, as there is virtually no chance we are making 5 and there is a good chance they are going down. |
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Stan should certainly not bid 6@C—we are vul and he has 2 aces. He should hope we are going down. If I were Stan, I would have doubled 5@D, and led my singleton spade.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since Ann doubled, he should be able to count on her for at least one trick. Ann probably does not have an opening hand. Her double simply promises 6+ points and the majors. There is some chance of a club void. But voids are pretty rare.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Our side in 5@D doubled is down 1. I happen to also have a singleton, but I lose 1 heart, 1 spade, and 1 club.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@C is an artificial bid, known as 4sf. It does not promise clubs (although on this hand Ann happens to have them). 4SF—"fourth suit forcing." It is completely artificial, and establishes a game force. BTW, it is alertable.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ann's next bid will clarify why she bid 2@C. Most often you bid 4SF for one of 2 reasons.
a) you are looking for 3-card support for your major (as on this hand)
b) you do not have the 4th suit stopped and want opener to bid NT with a stopper.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That was a hard hand to make with the bad diamond break. However, Ann needs to do a little planning. She has 7 sure tricks, 4 diamonds, 2 hearts and 1 spade. If diamonds break 4-3, she has a 5th diamond. that should be her first plan. If they are 5-2, then she can try for an extra trick in either clubs or 3-3 hearts. |
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If diamonds don't break, then she needs 4 heart tricks to make. She should pitch a club and a spade on the 2nd and 3rd diamonds and then when she sees the bad break, cash another diamond, pitching a spade, and play hearts hoping for a 3-3 break. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As for this hand, first of all Sandy's best lead is a spade. Whenever you have a 3 card honor sequence, that is a strong lead. Even a 2 card honor sequence is pretty good. The best opening lead in this hand is a spade.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Double is "stolen bid" (e.g. I was going to bid 2H). Many experts will tell you that double should show values and a willingness to defend. But I think stolen bid double is much more frequent and easier and better to play.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The point I am trying to make to Ann is that she can figure out the heart situation. Ann sees 9 hearts between her hand and dummy. That means Sandy and Stan have 4 between them. After the first trick, they have 2 left, the @HA and @HK. So regardless of how they are distributed, there is no reason to play a high heart. And in fact, a high heart might set up the @H8 in dummy. The bigger point is you should try and count out the critical suits on defense.|pc|H2|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) opened the BIL on  September 3, 2003 to provide the learner bridge player with a secluded place to attend lessons , mentoring sessions  and hosted practice sessions free from interruptions by the advanced bridge player.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions  and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to as you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }

CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
