up|52|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|OK Stan. you made the same strange play twice-trick ten and 12. You had 2 cards left in a suit, one that you knew was high, and one that was not high and you played the card that was not high. You did that both in spades and diamonds.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is no reason to do that, unless you are trying to set up a 3rd card in that suit. Play the high card first. Maybe the lower card will become good.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's talk about the opening lead. I know a lot of experts think you should lead an unbid major against NT. I think the old standby, 4th from longest and strongest works best. Assuming the opponents have not bid the suit.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, here, I would lead a diamond against a NT contract with Sandy's hand and, as you can see, it works well on this hand.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT|^b@2
enia_t: Leading from Ace-Queen is accepted then?|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Only against NT is a diamond lead reasonable. You do not lead from Ace-Queen in a suit contract because quite often only 2 rounds will go through before a suit gets ruffed. Therefore, if you give away a trick, you may never get it back.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, in NT, you are trying to set up the low cards in your long suit. Therefore, even if your lead ostensibly gives up a trick you will often get it back by setting up your long cards in the suit.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, if Sandy leads a diamond, their side will score 3 diamond tricks even if Stan gets his king. But say for the sake of argument we were playing in a club contract then, if Sandy led away from her AQ of diamonds, Stan would score his DK, and Sandy would only get 1 diamond trick because South is ruffing diamonds after the 2nd round.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Your objectives on opening lead are often different in suits than in NT. In NT, you are trying to set up the low cards in your long suit. Therefore, it is ok to lead away from honors, even aces. But in suits, you are trying to establish fast tricks and you should try to avoid leads that could easily give away a trick.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT||AT|^B@2
^*BMM: ^*N For an in depth opening lead please review Watson's "ELEMENTARY DEFENSE AGAINST NO-TRUMP CHAPTER XVII" which you can get it either from BIL library |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bilbridge.com^*N|CP||AT| or Howard's web site at |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/^*N|CP||AT|.

irinica:  Wasn't this a light opening?|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It was a light opener. I use the rule of 20. The rule of 20 says you should open the bidding if your ^*Bstandard HCP^*N + the length of your 2 longest suits is 20 or more. I have 11 HCP + 9 cards in the minors = 20.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT|^b@2
gimit: No Quick Tricks specified with the rule of 20?|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people play you should not open without 2 "Quick Tricks." Quick Trick represents how many fast tricks you can take. On this hand I only have 1.5 quick tricks-@DA = 1 quick trick and @CK = 0.5 Quick Tricks. Therefore, some would not open. but I do.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My style of opening is I open all hands which meet the rule of 20. And pass all hands that do not, even in 3rd seat (where many experts open light). |
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT|^b@2
 athni: But the @SQ10 is a dubious 2 points?|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
 ^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a different evaluation athni. For those who use Bergen hand evaluation the @SQ10 is a "dubious doubleton" and Bergen deducts 1 point for that. However, Bergen adds 1 point for the club quality suit. Let me explain Bergen's Rule of 20.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
 ^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bergen uses "^*Badjusted HCP^*n" + the length of your 2 longest suits. The "^*Badjusted HCP^*n" is Starting Points less the points for length.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
 ^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Starting Points has the following components:
^c@21) count the raw HCP; on this hand you have 11 raw HCP
^c@22) add points for each quality suit; I have 1 quality suit-clubs
^C@23) subtract for Dubious Doubleton/Singletons; I have 1 @SQ10-A dubious short suit is a Q or J doubleton, or a singleton K, Q, or J.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


nt|^B@2
^C@24) add or subtract for "adjust 3"; I have none-"adjust 3" basically adds an extra point if your hand is rich in Aces and Tens and subtracts a point if it is rich in Queens and Jacks.
^C@25) add 1 point for each card in each suit that has more than 4 cards in it-not for Rule of 20.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||AT|
^B@2^*BMM: ^*NA comprehensive tutorial based on Bergen's hand evaluation is available which you can get from either BIL library at |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bilbridge.com^*N|CP||AT| or from Howard's web site at |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/^*N|CP||AT|.

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ann is close to a double. Her singleton diamond is great as is her Aces and King. You can't have the perfect shape always. However, you do need an opening hand to double. In pass out seat I would for sure I double with that hand.|
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


mb|5D|NT||sk|S|lb|*mAll considered, which would be your choice of bid?^Double~Pass~5H~Too Close to Call^4|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is tough for me to know what is right if I was playing at regular table and could not see the other hands. Let me give you some general rules for bidding "5 over 5." Generally, you should avoid it. However, if you are short in the opponent's suit, that is a plus. You almost never bid 5 over 5 when you have a doubleton or higher. |
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
 ^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if you are pretty sure you can set it and there is good possibility of setting it 2, then you should double. Here I do have a singleton and a really nice suit. But the problem is, I don't know if Sandy has a good hand or not.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
 ^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, I don't worry too much about pushing them into a makable slam. After all said and done, I think on this hand 5H is indicated, but it could definitely be wrong.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let us renew discussion about Ann's possible bids.|SK|N|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The main argument for Ann doubling is being short in diamonds which makes it more likely that I have diamonds. And if I have diamonds I will often not have a bid over 3D if she passes. So if she passes, there is a good chance I will have to pass as I will not have a bid. Doubling lets us get to 3N if it makes, in addition to 4 of a major. But pass is certainly reasonable as well.|

A singleton honor, other than the ace, is not worth as much, because it may not take a trick. And a doubleton Q or doubleton J is also not worth as much. Dubious Singleton honors are easy to spot. However, Dubious Doubletons are a bit harder to spot. Bergen lists all of the Dubious Doubletons. Howard, however, thinks it is easier to define a Dubious Doubleton as |

For example, Qx and Jx are clearly Dubious Doubletons.  Kx is not a Dubious Doubleton, because the K is not forced to be played under the ace. Other examples of Dubious Doubletons are KQ,  QJ, and KJ.  Basically, Dubious Doubletons are defined as any doubleton with a Q or J and not the ace. According to Bergen's method you deduct one point for each Dubious Doubleton or Singleton. Let us count Starting Points of the next examples with added parameter of Dubious Doubletons/Singletons.|

A quality suit is defined as a 4-card or longer suit which contains three of the top five honors. Ace, King, Queen, Jack and Ten are the honors. You add one point for each quality suit in the hand-Quality Suite Point. For example KQ10x is considered a "quality suit" and equals one point. However, there would be no points for KQ10-only three cards. Following are several hands holding quality suits. The total number of Quality Suits Points is printed under each hand.|

{    Adjust-3    }
^-|CP||FP||CS||AT|
Adjust-3, the last part, is the most complicated but does not apply to most hands. The old method of assigning values of 4, 3, 2, 1 to Ace, King, Queen, and Jack respectively is not completely accurate. Based on recent mathematical analysis, using a 10 point system, the more accurate values are:^*B
^-
A = 4.5,  K = 3,  Q = 1.5,  J = .75,  10 = .25
^-|
PG| ***** 203 ***** |


AT|
^*NBut the beauty of 4-3-2-1 is, it is relatively easy and most have trouble remembering the more accurate new set of points count. Marty Bergen came up with a way of approximating these points count, which he calls "Adjust-3" and is much easier to use. The standard points count under values Aces and 10s and over values Queens and Jacks (Quacks). Therefore, if the hand contains lots more Aces and 10s, add something and if it contains lots more Queens and Jacks, subtract something. Therefore, for each hand, count up the number of Aces and 10s and count up the number of Queens and Jacks (Quacks).|
PG| ***** 204 ***** |


FP|2|AT|
^-
If the number of Aces and 10s is greater by 3 but less than 6 (for example you have 4 Aces 
and 10s and only 1 queen), add (adjust) 1 point to the hand's value.
|
PG| ***** 205 ***** |


AT|
Similarly, if the number of Queens and Jacks exceed the number of Aces and 10s by 3
but less than 6 (say you have 5 Queens and Jacks, and 2 Aces), you subtract (adjust) 1 point.|
PG| ***** 206 ***** |


AT|

If the difference is 6+ in either situations add/subtract (adjust) 2.
And finally, Do nothing if the difference is 2 or less.

%%%%%% Adjust 3
AT|
Doing Adjust-3 is rather most difficult part of Bergen's method. If you don't want to bother, most of the time it won't make a difference. What you can do instead is look at your hand. If there are lots of Queens and Jacks, or lots of Aces and 10s, then you can try to apply Adjust-3, otherwise don't need to bother. However, it is good to remember if Aces+Tens outnumber Quacks by 3 or more (but less than 6) add one point. If Quacks outnumber Aces+tens by 3 or more (but less than 6), subtract one point. Adjust 2 points if one group or the other outnumbers by 6+. Let us practice a few examples and figure out the Starting Points for each hand using the complete Bergen's method.|

^K@2^Y@310 Starting Points are the value of the hand. 11 HCP.  Adjustments are 2 length points, no quality suits, -2 for Dubious doubleton/singleton, and -1 for Adjust-3. |

^b@2Based on standard Rule 20 (combined length of two longest suits plus HCP) this hand is an opener. However, based on the implications of Bergen's method on Rule 20 this hand is not an opener. In Bergen's method Rule 20 is the combined length of two longest suits plus ^*Uadjusted^*N HCP. The ^*Uadjusted^*N HCP is the sum of regular HCP, quality suits, Adjust-3, and Dubious Singleton/Doubletons. In another word it is Starting Points without length points.|
PG| ***** 223 ***** |

The last hand has 8 ^*Uadjusted^*N HCP (11 HCP less 2 points for Dubious Singleton/Doubletons, and less one point for Adjust-3). Therefore, 4 (Hearts) + 6 (Diamonds) + 8 ^*Uadjusted^*N HCP = 18 and you cannot open it. This conflict only occurs with hands holding many Quacks and Dubious Singleton/Doubleton.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals.

Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play double dummy, you see all four handsits great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to take it. Now, you may lead the next cardfrom the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
