^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The spade lead was fine based on the bidding. However as I mentioned Anna should figure out that it is likely West only has 2 spades based on the auction. The other comment was Mary's play of the club suit. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|She should not touch clubs as Anna bid them. Anna will probably get the suit right, but Mary made it easy for her.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is possible that East has a singleton but unlikely because that means North has 6 clubs.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the bidding, my negative double is a tad light (I need to discount the @SQ) but I think it is justified, particularly since I don't mind if Anna bids 3@C.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are 2 problems with 3@S raise.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


AT|
 
1) It does not meet the LOTT, since Mary knows they do not have a 9-card fit.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


AT|
2) It may force us into bidding 4@H which we might not bid otherwise.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Concerns number 2 is something to be considered but not as important as number 1. In general, unless you have a very good reason, you should obey the LOTT virtually all the time. It is not perfect, but it is pretty close. It rarely fails me, and if I disobey it, I often get into trouble.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One thing an expert might do is bid 3@D with Mary's hand because it is likely North will be declarer and it is a good lead directing bid. 3@D is not forcing once I make a negative double.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I guess you could play it forcing, but most people don't and it is not a good idea as you will rarely have a hand where you want to force when both opps are bidding.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a reverse, showing at least 16 or so. Bidding in reverse auctions can be complicated.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


mb|p|mb|2n|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2N is some sort of convention called Ingberman convention which some people play it but it is not universal.
|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me briefly discuss reverse auctions and how to respond once opener reverses. First let me give Anna an undo.|ub||at| Some people play a fairly complicated system convention called Ingberman. It resembles Lebensohl, which is one of the most complicated conventions there is. That is why I strongly recommend against playing it.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The problem with reverse auctions is, often it is not clear to responder whether or not their side should be in game. Revers(er), me here, can have as little as 16 and responder, Anna here, can have as little as 6. |
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But I can have 18 or more, or Anna could have 10 or more. So it is difficult, without some sort of agreements, to decide whether or not to be in game. |
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ingberman solves the problem as follows. If responder bids 2N, reverser is required to bid 3@C with a minimum reverse hand (16-bad 18). After reverser bids 3@C (showing minimum hand), responder is responsible for placing the contract.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are a lot of problems with that approach in my opinion. So I suggest you adopt the approach I play, which I think makes bidding much easier. There are no "relays" in my approach.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If responder has a game forcing hand, she bids 4th Suit Forcing. In this case for example, if Anna decided she had a game force she could bid 2@H to establish a game force. Any other bid by Anna does not establish a game force, and is assumed by reverser, me here, to show less than a game force.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, I do have another rule to give the auction a little more flexibility. That rule is that the partnership cannot stop below 2N.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if Anna bid, for example, 2@S over 2@D, she is not establishing a game force, but it is still forcing because her bid is below 2N. |
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Again the two rules for responder are:
a) 4SF establishes a game force
b) the partnership cannot stop below 2N.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||Other than 4SF, in my system, all other bids are natural. If Anna bids anything else (say 3@C or 3@D) that shows less than a game force. Note the 3@C and 3@D are above 2N. 2@S would show 5 spades. |
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If Anna does not establish a game force, then opener, with 18+, becomes captain and is responsible for getting to game. In effect 2N becomes responder's "minimum" second bid instead of an Ingberman relay. It should show a stopper in the unbid suit.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have used this approach quite successfully for many years. I am not sure why more people don't play it.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


mb|3C|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this example, Anna has a borderline hand. Its not clear whether or not she has a game force. Personally, with 2 aces, I would call her hand a game force. |
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But deciding it is not a game force is certainly quite reasonable. Therefore, 3@C bid says you don't have a game force. And since I have a minimum reverse, I will pass.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


pc|C5|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's count tricks. I have 5 clubs, 1 spade, and 2 hearts for sure. Probably my best shot for a 9th trick is for either the @DA to be onside or diamonds to be 3-3. Therefore, my plan for making is to try and establish a diamond trick.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


pc|C2|pc|C9|pc|CK|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, there is no reason to delay drawing trump. But I want to end up in dummy to lead a diamond.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Couple bidding points. Also some experts would think Anna is too strong to open 1N. She has a 5 card suit, which is worth a point, and she also has a quality suit. Therefore, it would not be wrong for her to open 1@D intending to jump to 2N (18-19). |
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is how I decide whether or not to open 1N. I count my Bergen Starting points. If they are in the upper part of the range, then I upgrade my hand for NT. For example, if I have 16 starting points, even if I only have 13 or 14 HCP, I would open 1NT. |
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand I would not open 1NT with 15 Starting points, unless I also have 15 HCP and if I have 19 starting points, I consider that worth a jump to 2N. In this case Anna has 19 Bergen Starting points (17 HCP, 1 5-card suit, 1 quality suit) so it is eligible for a jump to 2N after opening 1@D. Based on my style, if she had 1 less HCP (e.g. 16 HCP) with 18 starting points, I would open 1N.|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I do use Bergen Starting points, but because Bergen is even more optimistic than me, I adjust by 1 point :). Actually he thinks I am too optimistic :)|

On the other hand, 3@C could be the right place to play. Hard to know for sure. In general, this hand looks like at least somewhat of a misfit, in which case passing ASAP is usually the best idea.|mb|p|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) opened the BIL on  September 3, 2003 to provide the learner bridge player with a secluded place to attend lessons , mentoring sessions  and hosted practice sessions free from interruptions by the advanced bridge player.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to as you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
