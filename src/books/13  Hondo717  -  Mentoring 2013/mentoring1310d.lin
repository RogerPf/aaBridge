^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the auction 1 minor-1@H-?, there is only 1 unbid major (spades). But there are 2 bids available to show spades, a negative double and 1@S. So experts differentiate between the meanings of the 2 bids. A negative double shows exactly 4 spades. And a bid of 1S shows 5 or more spades.|mb|1H|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If the auction goes 1 minor-1@S-?, it is true that both double and 2H show hearts. But 2@H promises 10+ and 5+ hearts. You would negative double if a) you only have 4 hearts or b) you have fewer than 10 points (or both). So the auction 1 minor-1@H-dbl has a somewhat different meaning than the auction 1 minor-1@S-dbl.)|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, on the auction 1@C-1@D-?, there are 2 unbid majors. So double shows both majors. 1@H shows hearts only (but could be a 4-card suit). 1@S shows spades only (but could be a 4-card suit). I can pass. I should only bid if I have something to say. I would not argue with a pass with my hand. On the other hand, 1@H is a good bid as I have a reasonably nice heart suit because of the intermediate cards (the @HK987).|mb|2d|sk|N|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If Ruth did not play support doubles, then she should bid 2@H. Playing support doubles, the double shows 3 card support whereas 2@H promises 4. But not playing support doubles (or if Liza had passed) Ruth should bid 2@H. You should not be afraid to raise on 3-card support with Ruth's hand.|mb|d|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ruth's club which I am ruffing is a suit preference signal. Had she led a high club, that says she would prefer the higher of the remaining suits (spades in this case). A low club says she wants me to lead back the lower of the remaining suits (hearts in this case). On this hand, since I bid hearts, she does want a heart back. But on other hands it would not be as clear.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I know a lot about Jacquie's hand. I know she started with 5 diamonds based on my diamond holding. I know she started with 2 clubs. I also know, based on the auction (Ruth's support double) she started with 4 hearts. Therefore, she must have 2 spades.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I also know Jacquie has the @HJx left, based on Ruth's heart play. The reason I am discussing this is because this is what experts do every hand. They automatically count out declarer's hand and figure out what she has. On many hands when there is a lot of bidding, it is not all that hard once you make the effort.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me further discuss the bidding in particular the 2@D and 3@D bids. I would not bid 2@D with Liza's hand. I would either bid 2@C (or 2@H) to show a limit raise. I could bid 3@D to show 4-card diamond support. Similarly, by my competitive guidelines, Jacquie should pass the double. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You only bid 3 over 3 with a known 9-card fit (and 2@D only promises 3-card support) or a singleton in the opps suit. However, given she bid 2@D, Liza should then bid 3@D anyway because she knows that E/W has a 9 card fit. Once again showing that LOTT works

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once again, this illustrates why you should attempt to count out the hand. I suggest you review my lessons on carding and signaling. You can get them at |CP|1|AT|^*Htinyurl.com/k64fvcc^*N|CP||AT| , at |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/n5rw4w^*N|CP||AT| and at |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/f7rw4w^*N|CP||AT|.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next let me talk about Ruth's 1@H bid. Using Bergen hand evaluation, she technically has 10 "adjusted" HCP, 9 HCP + quality suit. So her hand does meet the Rule of 20 and could be opened 1@H. However, although I do believe in the rule of 20, I also believe that on many hands with 10 or fewer HCP even if they meet the Rule of 20, they do so because of a long suit.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, I will often open a preempt rather than 1. On this hand, although Ruth could open 1@H, my choice would be 3@H as being more descriptive. Keep that in mind when you have Rule of 20 hands with 10 HCP or fewer.|

So if Jacquie decided that she had enough points to bid 4@H, she should actually make a 4@D splinter. But she has 18 dummy points.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss the auction first. Some people felt that Ruth was not strong enough to reverse. I think she was strong enough for sure. Yes, she only has 14 HCP but as people say, her hand is much better than that. She can add 2 length points for the hearts, and 2 points for the quality suits giving her 18 Bergen Starting points. |
PG| ***** 100 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For those who like Losing Trick Count, her hand is a 5 loser hand, also worth a reverse. However, I think 3@H is a better bid. Granted, I might not bid 3N over 3@H if I have enough points but lack a spade stopper. Also as you know in 2/1 we need to mind two situations.|
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Situation A - if the auction goes 1@H-2 minor-2@S, 2@S is technically a reverse. However, because 2 minor is a game force, many (probably a majority of) experts play that 2@S does not show extra values. It is merely bidding out your shape and can be done with a min opener.|
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Situation B - if the auction goes 1@H-1N-2@S, that is definitely a reverse. 1N is not a game force and can, in fact, be done with a weak hand. So opener should not bypass 2@H unless they have a nice hand. Situation B is what we have here.|
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| 3@H, however, is more precise, showing 6 nice hearts and her medium strength opener (not game forcing). There is also some question as to whether my 2N was forcing. I play, as I mentioned during last session, 2N would not be forcing. Therefore, I should have bid 3@C, a forcing bid, because with 10 HCP I want to be in game over against a reverse hand. Regardless, we ended up in the best contract.|
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, my two comments are Jacquie's play of the @DA, trick 6, when Ruth played a diamond. She violated my 2nd hand low rule. In her defense, some of you may say, well if she didn't play the @DA and Ruth decided to play the king, she loses a diamond trick. That is maybe true as far as it goes. However even if Ruth plays the @DK all Jacquie is doing is trading tricks. |
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because then Ruth does not get a discard on the @DK. So, almost always, 2nd hand low, especially when you hold the Ace and the King-Jack is in dummy. Ruth might very well have decided to play the Jack. Then her side would certainly had 2 diamond tricks. I know its hard, but if you always play 2nd hand low, I promise you you will come out ahead in the long run. At trick 3, Liza also violated the 2nd hand low rule in spades, and ended setting up Ruth's @S7. Trust me on 2nd hand low :).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's discuss the best way for Liza to raise hearts. 2@H only promises 3 card support. You need to bid 3@H to show 4-card support and less than a limit raise. 3@H is not a Bergen Raise. Over a double, even if you don't play Bergen Raises, 2@H promises 3 card support, 3@H promises 4 card support, both show less than 10 points.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bergen Raises are not on over doubles unless you have that agreement. I personally think you should play Bergen Raises over takeout doubles, but that is non-standard. So if we were playing Bergen Raises, Liza has a 7-9 point raise (3@C regular Bergen, 3@D reverse Bergen). Always use LOTT after interference.|ub||

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) opened the BIL on  September 3, 2003 to provide the learner bridge player with a secluded place to attend lessons , mentoring sessions  and hosted practice sessions free from interruptions by the advanced bridge player.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to as you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
