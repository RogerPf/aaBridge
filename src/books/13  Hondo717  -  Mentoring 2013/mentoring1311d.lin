^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some of you might have doubled with Gail's hand had Babs opened 1@C instead of 1@D. However, with 5/4 in the majors, and a choice of doubling or not, I usually tend to overcall my 5 card suit rather than double. The only time I double is if my 5 card suit is weak. |
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general it works out better if you show your length in a major. If you double partner will never play you for a 5-card suit. So unless partner has 4 cards in your other major and only 2 cards in your overcall, it works out better and that rarely happens. And if partner happens to have 4 cards in your overcall, it works out great to overcall.|mb|1S|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First let us talk a little about the play. Based on the auction, Babs made the best lead. unfortunately West was the one with 4 diamonds.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the auction 2@C was a good bid as was 2N. 3N was a tad of a stretch, but as you know, it is much better, especially in IMPs to play 3N rather than 2N. So I like Gail's 3N call. The only time it is wrong is if they can make exactly 2N and not 3N.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the line of play, Irene got it basically right. She wants to set up clubs but, at trick 4, she should play the @C9 right away to preserve all her heart entries. That was a minor issue and turned out not to cost. But an expert player, if they had AKx of clubs, might have ducked, and then Irene could conceivably have been an entry short. Although on this hand, because of the club holding it turned out not to matter.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT|^B@2
foxyausy: Howard, I stretched a tad by bidding 3N as I thought 2@C by Irene promises a full opening hand opposite an overcall and is forcing.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is not how I play it Gail. Although you don't have to have a good hand you certainly could. Surely you do you want Irene to pass with 10 points. Let me expand this issue further. First, let me define a couple of terms.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|"Responder", as you know, is the term we use for the partner of the opener. Similarly, "advancer" is the term we use for the partner of an overcaller. So the partner of the ^*Bopener^*N is the ^*Bresponder^*N and partner of ^*Bovercaller^*N is the ^*Badvancer^*N. And the rules for taking a bid by an ^*Badvancer^*N is slightly different.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One general problem I see some of my students have is they feel that advancer has to have a stronger hand than responder to take the same actions. That is not really the case. It is true that, unlike responder, who must bid with 6+ points if there is a pass after an opening bid, advancer does not have the same obligation. Advancer, without 3+ card support, can pass with even some relatively strong hands (up to 9 or even a bad 10/his defensive cards) even when there is a pass after partner's overcall.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, it is also true that bids by advancer are somewhat similar to bids by responder. So a new suit at the 1-level can be done with as few as 6 or 7 points and a new suit at the 2 level only promises 10 points. However, one difference between responder and advancer is that ^*Ba new suit by advancer is almost always a 5-card suit^*N.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also, I play that, just like a new suit by responder is forcing, a new suit by advancer is also forcing. Some experts play new suits by advancer are not forcing (and hence cue bids are the only forcing bid that advancer can make and do not necessarily show support), but I think that is wrong and often creates unnecessarily difficult bidding problems for advancer. So I very much recommend you play a new suit by advancer is forcing.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Again I like to emphasize that  regardless of point count if you have 9 or less LOTT is your main guide in deciding how high to bid. With support and 10+ you can cue bid. I tend to prefer that a cue bid shows 4-card support, as I think uncovering a 9-card fit is very important. So, with 3-card support and 10+ I will usually bid a new suit if possible, and only cue bid with 3-card support if I have no other good bid available. |
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, if you want to play that a cue bid only promises 3-card support, that is a reasonable way to play. Or if you want to use both 2NT and cue bids to differentiate between 3-card and 4-card support, that is fine as well.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On another point as an advancer, I will not necessarily bid 1NT with 8-9 unless I have a stopper in the opponents' suit(s) and at least a doubleton in partner's suit. As I said above, you can pass with as much as 9 and should do so unless you have a reason to bid. |
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Reasons to bid include: 
showing a good suit of your own, 
showing a stopper in the opponent's suit, or, most importantly,
showing partner you have support for his suit. 
Also a bid of 2N can be made with 11-14. You can bid 3N with 15+.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As I mentioned above, change of suit by advancer shows the same values as if made by responder. That is change of suit at the 1 level can be made with as little as 6 or 7 points (although if you are weak you should have a good and/or long suit) and change of suit at the 2 level can be done with as little as 10. And change of suit shows a 5+ card suit.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|After a takeout double my teaching maintains, any bid other than redouble and 2NT (Jordan) denies 10 points. However, just so you know, it is more common to play that bids at the 1-level over a takeout double are forcing -- they only promise 6 points but can be made with 10 or more points. But bids at the 2-level deny 10 points. I find that very counter-intuitive which is why I recommend my style of redoubling and 2N as the only way to show 10+ points and make a forcing bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to Babs bidding. I don't open light in third or 4th seat. In third seat, I think there is some case to open. In fact, Marty Bergen just did a lesson on third hand openers, and he would recommend that Irene open 1@D as lead directing. But I think pass is better. |
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 4th seat some people use the "rule of 15" (another of my non-favorite rules). The rule of 15 says if your HCP and spades are 15 or more, you should open. But since for Babs it equals 14 she doesn't have that excuse -:). The reason for the rule is, it makes it harder to be outbid in spades if you have long spades. I don't like opening light in 4th seat because I play rule of 20 openers, which means I open light distributional hands in 2nd seat. So if I don't have a rule of 20 hand in 4th seat, it is very unlikely we will miss a game.|mb|1D|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me count my Declarer Points. I have 9 HCP, 1 point each for the two 4-card side suits, 2 points for the singleton. That theoretically gives me 13, enough to bid game. But I don't like my singleton in Babs diamonds, and my hand has a lot of quacks and I will simply invite. However, I will invite by bidding a new suit to help Babs better evaluate her hand.|mb|2S|

up|52|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First let me discuss the opening lead. Normally it is not a good idea to lead a suit the opponents bid. It was ok for West to not lead a diamond. But with KQJ a diamond lead has merit given it is a minor suit. If North had bid a major, and I held KQJ of that major I would not lead the suit regardless, because I know that is North's long suit. |
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But in a minor you have a bit more latitude (although most of the time (80%+) the opener has at least 4 cards in their minor). Therefore, it is fine that Irene chose not to lead a diamond. A club lead is a little risky, but given it is the unbid suit, a reasonable choice. However, the Jack promises the 10 or a doubleton. So given she chose to lead a club, the @C6 is the correct lead. Here it turns out not to matter but it could.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next is the bidding. There is some case to be made to open light in 3rd seat because given 2 passes, it is likely 4th seat has an opener. It turns out, after 2 passes, the average HCP holding between the 2 passers is about 16 HCP. Therefore, on average, 3rd and 4th seat will hold 24 HCP. Thus, in 3rd seat, say you have a 10 count that means it is likely 4th seat has around 14. So if you want to make it more difficult for them to bid, you could make a case for opening light. |
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, I see little point in opening a 1 bid light (especially 1 of a minor). But I do see a good case for preempting, even opening a weak 2 with a 5-card suit and a singleton or void because that means 4th seat has to start bidding at the 2 or 3 level. After all is said and done, in third seat I recommend very aggressive preempts, especially not vul but not light opening 1 bids.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT|^B@2
BabsG:  Howard - in this auction is the 1@H by passed hand forcing?|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since I am a passed hand 1@H is not forcing. However, I do play, assuming you play 2/1, that 1N is still forcing over 1 of a major because sometimes with a 1N hand you have a 3-card limit raise or a long suit of your own that you want to play in. So although many experts play 1N by a passed hand as semi-forcing, I play it as forcing.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Babs has no good leads but @DA doubleton is not my first choice. She really doesn't want a ruff since she has 2 natural trump tricks and partner will think she has the @DK unless partner has it or it is in dummy. Leading A doubleton (except in pard's suit) can often work out badly. I would lead the @HA personally. In general, it is not good to lead unprotected aces, but if you must, doing it in a longer suit is better than in a shorter suit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, recently I read a new rule for opening lead and Kia is preparing a tutorial on it.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If defended properly, probably should be down 2 or 3. They can make 3N so that still would be a good result at this vulnerability. Let me review the bidding a bit. Babs has to double. She is too strong to simply overcall 3@H. I would not hate 3N by her (although that bid is typically made with a long running minor and a spade stopper). Gail has a problem. As I said in IMPs I probably bid 3@C, but pass is certainly conceivable. The problem is, in general, partner will be short in spades, and Gail's spade honors are in front of any spade honors I might have. I am just saying why I would bid rather than pass.|
PG| ***** 96 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think there was some overbidding on both West and East's part, but to be fair to poor Babs (who I have picked on today) her 3@C bid was ok. She has 14 Dummy Points. So 3@C is certainly conceivable. The problem is, the Dummy Points are assuming they are playing in clubs. But the 3 shortness points are not useful in the more likely NT contract. With only 1 ace and 3 quacks, I think 14 is way over valued for Babs hand despite the Bergen count. |
PG| ***** 146 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But even if we downgrade it to 12 or 11, 3@C is reasonable. On the other hand, with only 11 HCP and a void in Babs suit, I think pass is pretty clear with the East hand.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) opened the BIL on  September 3, 2003 to provide the learner bridge player with a secluded place to attend lessons , mentoring sessions  and hosted practice sessions free from interruptions by the advanced bridge player.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|1|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
