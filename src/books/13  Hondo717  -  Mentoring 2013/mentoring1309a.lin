^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Based on Auction and the play now I know since Ruth most likely started with 4 spades Liza has one spade left. I also know that Liza has 4 hearts. Experts always try and count out the hand. Sometimes that information is not useful, but often it is, and if you get in the habit of making these deductions, it becomes easier to defend on many hands.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That was a hard hand because of the bad heart break. The key bid of the auction was 3@S by Ruth. That really put a monkey wrench into the auction. Although she is a little weak, it is a good bid based on the LOTT.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Liza, has a game forcing hand and needs to set the contract accordingly—3NT. Remember the general principle that responder is "captain" of the hand and usually in charge of getting to the right contract. The captain may ask partner questions, but is responsible for deciding the final contract. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case, Liza knows once pard opens 1N the final contract will be either 4@H or 3N. Once Ruth does not show 4@H, 3N is the contract. Being captain is easiest when pard opens 1NT because you almost always know what your choices are immediately.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The problem with that play is Ruth may have turned 2 spade tricks into 1 spade trick. So she should have taken the @SK and hoped Jacquie had the @SA. Because now she will only get 1 spade trick.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It certainly is sometimes right to duck when they lead your weak suit. But sometimes you give up a trick by doing so. It is not always easy to decide but on this hand because Jacquie led spades it is more likely she has the @SA.|

up|52|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nice play by Ruth. It helped when 2 suits break 3-3. Suits only break 3-3 a little more than 1/3 of the time and 2 suits breaking 3/3 only happen about 10% of the time. So this hand was 1 in 10.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Remember, even suits break oddly, odd suits break evenly. That means when there are an odd number out (e.g. the opponents have for example 5 cards in your suit) they tend to break as evenly as possible. So if you have an 8-card fit, the most likely break is 3-2 a 10-card fit the most likely break is 2-1.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But when the opponents have an even ## of cards out against you, an even break is not as likely. So with a 9-card fit a 3-1 break is more likely than a 2-2 break. With a 7-card fit a 4-2 break is more likely than a 3-3 break. You don't need to memorize the odds. just the general principles behind how suits are likely to break.|

^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1@D is the correct bid. However, lets imagine that Jacquie's red suits are swapped such that she has @SAK87 @HAQJ1085 @DKQ @C9. In that case, her hand meets the Marty Bergen "4 and 4" rule for opening 2@C when your suit is a major. |
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Marty Bergen uses the "4 and 4" rule when determining whether or not to open 2@C when your long suit is a major. The "4 and 4 rule" states you should open 2@C when your hand contains at least 4 quick tricks and has no more than 4 losers. Jacquie's hand is close. You could say she has 5 losers with AKxx of spades having 2 losers. The way he counts losers in a hand is different than standard.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, with diamonds it is a clear 1@D opener. You should be reluctant to open 2@C when your suit is diamonds. Because the auction is likely to go 2@C-P-2@D-P-3@D and there you are with the contract wrong sided and the first natural bid at the 3-level.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Sometimes it can't be helped, but that is why opening 2@C with a diamond suit is very problematical.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


AT|
jacquiek:  I only have 3 Quick Tricks.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No you actually have 4.5 quick tricks— 2 in spades, 1 in hearts, and 1.5 in diamonds. But as I said 1 diamond is the correct bid. Next is a simple guide for counting your Quick Tricks.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A = 1 QT
AK = 2 QT
K = .5 QT
KQ = 1 QT
AQ = 1.5 QT|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Counting losers the way Bergen intended is more difficult. You do not use the common Losing Trick Count method to determine losers. You count what you expect to be your actual losers in the suit, based on an average length (with no high cards) in partner's hands. Sometimes counting losers is fairly easy. |
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, if you hold AKQxxxx, that is no losers; since there are 6 cards out, on average partner will hold 2, so you will rarely lose any tricks in that suit. Even AKQxxx can be considered 0 losers; with 7 cards missing, partner on average will have slightly over 2 cards in the suit, and with an 8 card fit, if the suit breaks 3-2, you will have no losers. As another example, Axxx is a  3 loser suit, because partner on average will have 3 cards in the suit, but a 3-3 break is not likely. |
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A few other examples. You can consider AQ a half loser suit (you may or may not lose a trick depending on which defender  has the K) . Similarly Kx is a 1.5 loser suit (which defender has the A determines whether or not you will lose 2 tricks). KQx is 1.5 losers (whether you lose 1 or 2 tricks depends on where the A is located).  KQ doubleton is one loser.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@C does put a fly in the ointment. Without 2@C you would have bid 1@S. But Ruth's 2@C forces you to bid 2@S which is a reverse because 2@D is available for Jacquie to bid. She cannot double as it would show clubs.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


NT|^B@2
BabsG: Could she cue @Cs?|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|She could but that would ask me to bid 3N with a club stopper.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


mb|p|NT||sk|s|lb|*bPlease make a bid for South.^^3S|mb|3S|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is a subtlety to this auction. Lets first discuss the auction assuming Ruth had not bid 2@C. So it goes 1@D-P-1@H-P-2@S-P-?. Now because Jacquie jump shifted we are in a game forcing auction. So the principle of "fast arrival" applies. |
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I bid 4@S that shows a weaker hand than if I bid 3@S. Because we are forced to game by 2@S, if I jump to game that is weaker. I want to go slowly when I have slam interest to preserve room.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now lets look at the auction the way it actually went, 1@D-P-1@H-2@C-2@S-P-?. Jacquie has reversed but not jump shifted. She still could have a game forcing hand, but she might just have 16 or so. 2@S is a 1 round force, but it is not a game force. |
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Then in that case 3@S by me is weaker than 4@S. I don't know if Jacquie has more than 16, so I can't jump to 4@S with only 6 or 7. I can only invite.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


mb|p|sk|n|NT||lb|*bPlease make a bid for North.^^4S|mb|4D|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not saying Jacquie is wrong to try for slam but it is pretty unlikely because I have no more than 7 or 8 points. So I would probably just bid 4@S with her hand.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT||sk||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|6@S is actually a pretty interesting contract but very difficult to play. In 6@S East can't lead away from an ace so has to lead the ace. She doesn't necessarily have a doubleton.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Hands with 4-1 breaks are very difficult to play. Probably the best way to play the hand is to set up dummy. At trick 2 lead a heart. You need to not ruff clubs and shorten your trump voluntarily. So my plan would have been to try and set up hearts. |
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once I do that, I can try and ruff 2 clubs in my hand, and pitch one club on the diamond ace. But you need to knock out the @HA first. Then I think you still make 4. But very hard hand to play.|
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand also illustrates an interesting psychology about how most players view hands. Several years ago some of you may remember I did the BIL puzzles. I had two puzzles several months apart. In one puzzle I gave a play problem which required that you set up suits in declarer's hand in order to make the hand. Most people got that right.|
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Then a few months later I gave the same hands, but I reversed who was dummy and who was declarer. So the right way to play the hand was to set up dummy. Most people got that wrong because it was easier to visualize setting up your own hand even though a few months earlier they had played the same exact hand correctly. |
PG| ***** 96 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand is another illustration of that. It is difficult for many players to envision setting up the south hand which is dummy even though that is the best way to play the hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people asked why I did not reverse to 2@S. That would not be wrong. But since pard denied spades there would be no reason for me to bid that. And that way I could hide my spade suit. And perhaps get a favorable spade lead. |
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You should not hide what you have just for the sake of hiding it. In general it is better to let partner know what you have than not. But on this hand there is no point in letting pard know you have spades, since she does not have them.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 2nd point is what to lead. Some people advocate leading an unbid major in NT. Frankly I am not a big fan of that theory unless it seems like the best lead anyway. I like "4th from longest and strongest" but do not count suits the opponents have bid. So I would have led a diamond, which is Jacquie's "longest and strongest" of the unbid suits.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) opened the BIL on  September 3, 2003 to provide the learner bridge player with a secluded place to attend lessons , mentoring sessions  and hosted practice sessions free from interruptions by the advanced bridge player.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }

Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
