sk||AT| But I do not really have enough points to bid. We make 1@S or 2@S but it would not be a good idea for me to bid. Because often partner will make some forcing bid like a jump shift or reverse. So, unless you have a fit, it is better not to bid unless you have at least 6 points (or a good 5).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very nice. Nothing more to add to the bidding. As to the play, Dave should play low on the first heart then he will get 2 heart tricks rather than 1. Generally, you should avoid playing your aces (even 3rd hand) unless they capture an honor. On this hand with @HAJ, Dave is sure of 2 heart tricks if he plays low.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Any bid by me other than redouble or Jordan 2N denies 10 points. So if I bid 1@H here, for example, I play it is not forcing, and is less than 10.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, many people play something more complicated. They play bids at the 1 level by me are forcing but bids at a higher level are not forcing. So, for example, they play 1@H by me is forcing and may (or may not) have more than 10 points. But 2@C by me would not be forcing. I think that is rather confusing for most people.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, I recommend you play that the only forcing bids that show 10 or more points are:
a) redouble and 
b) 2N, which shows 4+ clubs and 10+ points (e.g. a limit raise).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand also illustrates that when you run a long suit, watch what the defense discards. It is very easy and common for the defense to discard incorrectly. Even expert defenders misdiscard.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East double also needs a comment. She had reasonable shape but was light a couple of HCP. With 4-4 in the majors and a singleton, I might double but with her hand I might just bid 2@C, as that is somewhat preemptive. It is true they could miss a spade fit but besides the preemptive value of 2@C, Ruth would prefer a club lead.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out Ruth can make 4 if she is in it. She starts out the same way. But after cashing the @DK she should lead a spade to the King. It is likely I have the @CA because I preempted and it is unlikely I have the @SA.|
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the bidding I don't think West should bid 4@H. When partner bids they are assuming you have at least a modest hand most of the time—7 or 8 points. West does have a slightly better hand than average once pard bids 3@H. If she were 3-1 in the black suits I might bid 4 especially with a singelton club. |
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because that would give her 6 HCP + 1 length point + 3 for singleton =  10. But with only 2 kings, I think pass is right. Partner is in the balancing seat and might be stretching a bit.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ruth is a little strong for 3@H. The problem is she has no good bid which is why you preempt. So 4@H is possible. Double is possible, but if she does that and partner bids 3@S, what will she do? Nevertheless, I would probably double. If partner bid 3@D, I would bid 3@H, which is a double and correct showing a good hand. If partner bid 3@S, I would bid 4@S, hoping pard has 5 or a good 4 card suit and of course if pard bids 3@H I would bid 4.|

The general rule is, when you have no clear cut bid, make the bid that, if it works, is most likely to give you a very good result. So, with ruth's hand, I would be willing to play 4@H if pard bid 3@H and I am willing to double and correct which is why I would choose the double, but it is certainly not clear.

However, medium hands (15-17) are difficult to describe in terms of point count.

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) opened the BIL on  September 3, 2003 to provide the learner bridge player with a secluded place to attend lessons , mentoring sessions  and hosted practice sessions free from interruptions by the advanced bridge player.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
