up|14|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss the auction. The bids through 2@H are fine. Then Ruth needs to decide what to do. Ruth has a very nice hand, especially in clubs. A club slam is very possible. A heart slam might be possible as well, but with such nice clubs, it is likely clubs will play at least as well, and probably better, than hearts.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The problem is, Ruth has only 1 key card and if you use 4NT to ask about key cards they could easily get too high if they are missing 3 key cards. In general playing 2/1, 4@C over 2@H is not a good bid because the idea is to go slowly once a game force is established. Having said that, an expert might very well bid 4@C with Ruth's hand, for the following reasons.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The message being conveyed by 4@C is "Partner I have a self sufficient club suit and I am very interested in slam. Just start control bidding." Ruth in particular is worried about spades. |
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So a possible expert auction might start as 1@H-2@C-2@H-4@C. Then Jacquie would bid 4@D and Ruth would bid 4@H. Finally, Jacquie, lacking a spade control would bid 5@C and the auction would end there.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If Jacquie bid 4@S over 4@H then Ruth might venture 6@C, hoping that they have enough key cards. But it is very difficult to bid slam in a minor playing RKCB because the responses over 4NT might get the partnership too high which is why some expert partnerships play an ace asking convention known as "^*BKickback^*N."|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you played kickback (and I don't suggest you do) then the suit one higher than the trump suit is used as the Key Card Ask. Therefore, if you were in a potential club slam auction, 4@D would be the Key Card Ask playing Kickback.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And (using 0314 scheme) the response steps would be: 
Step 1 4@H ^e= 0 or 3 Key Cards, 
Step 2 4@S ^e= 1 or 4 Key Cards, 
Step 3 4N  ^e= 2 Key Cards - no trump queen and
Step 4 5@C ^e= 2 Key Cards - with trump queen.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That way, if the partnership did not have enough Key Cards they could still end up playing 5@C.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


AT|
duffer66: Kickback has to be at 4 level?  |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, if you play kickback 
4@D ^C= Key Card Ask in clubs, 
4@H ^C= Key Card Ask in diamonds, 
4@S ^C= Key Card Ask in hearts, 
4N  ^C= Key Card Ask in spades.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But, as I said, I don't recommend you play it. I play it with one partner and often I am confused as to whether his bid is kickback, a control bid, or natural. We don't have a good record of bidding slams.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now as to the auction as it went. Over 3@C, Jacquie's 3@D bid was a good bid, asking Ruth to bid 3N with a spade stopper. Ruth decided 4@H was a better contract. And by bidding 4@H rather than 3@H, showed little slam interest. As to whether or not Jacquie should bid 5@C, I am not sure. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is likely Ruth only has 2 hearts with some honor. With 3 hearts, Ruth would have either bid 3@H (or 4@H) over 2@H or 3@H over 3@D. And since Ruth repeated her clubs, Jacquie knows Ruth has a nice 6+ card suit most likely. So Kxx is great support and 5@C is certainly a reasonable bid.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The only issue she needs to think about is it is harder to take 11 tricks than 10 tricks. But it is hard to know for sure whether 4@H or 5@C is a better contract. She should suspect 2 spade losers which means their side can't lose any other tricks. Whereas in 4@H they can lose 3 tricks. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So in general you try to avoid playing 5 of a minor when another alternative (3NT or 4 of a major) is available. On this hand, 5@C could easily be right as it turns out, both 4@H and 5@C makes. In IMPs 5@C and 4@H is pretty much irrelevant. In MPs it is relevant. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Other than the 1@H bid, I thought the auction was fine. Jacquie promises 5 spades with her 1@S bid (she makes a negative double with 4 spades). Ruth has 20 Dummy Points (15 HCP, 1 length point, 1 quality suit point, and 3 points for the singleton). 20 Dummy Points is enough to bid game not to mention, 4@S over 4@H with a 9+ card fit is almost always a good bid. As it turns out, 4@H is down at least 1 but hard to know that for sure.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, Jacquie has to hope for only 2 spade losers and 1 club loser. So spades need to be 2-2 or she has to decide who is more likely to have a singleton spade honor or hope that the AK are in one hand. It turns out if she wins the @DQ in her hand and plays a spade towards the Q, she only loses 1 spade trick because I have the singleton spade honor. But it is hard to know that for sure.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am just saying you should be aware of all the common suit combinations so you can make a plan as to how to play spades. As to who you should play for the singleton spade it is hard to say. And Jacquie still needs the club finesse to make 4.|

And on this hand, not vul against vul, with such nice diamonds and great distribution (6-4), 3@D is actually the call that many experts would make at least those who don't worry about the outside 4 card major.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand I have some suggestions for Liza's bidding. Although double is possible, I think 2N over 2@D is a better bid. That way Liza shows her point count. You should strain to overcall (and open) NT when you have the appropriate hand. It gives partner a very accurate picture of what you have and makes it more likely your side will get to the right contract. However, some people would double with West's hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First the bidding. First of all, you have to decide, when playing 2/1 if 1N by a passed hand is still forcing. I personally like to play it is, but many play it non-forcing or semi-forcing. For those who play it non-forcing (and do not play Drury) Liza has to bid 2@C because she has a 3-card limit raise.|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out even if you play Drury, you bid 2@C but that is a different discussion. Let me skip Drury for the moment and discuss why I like 1N as forcing even by a passed hand. There are often hands where you want 1N to be forcing when you have less than an opener such as a 3-card limit raise, as Liza had or a weak hand with a long suit. |
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I like playing 1N as forcing. Some people play a convention known as Drury. It is particularly useful if you play light 3rd seat openers (which I do not usually do). Drury works as follows.|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If partner opens 1 of a major in 3rd seat, 2@C and 2@D are both artificial bids. 2@C shows a 3-card limit raise (such as Liza's hand, her clubs are irrelevant if playing Drury). 2@D shows a 4-card limit raise. If opener rebids their suit, it shows a sub-minimum opener. Otherwise they have to bid something other than 2 of their suit. I am not a big fan of Drury, but many experts love it.|

NT||cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, I could simply bid 3@H (cuebid) to show a limit raise but 2@H makes my hand even better, because now my heart shortness is particularly valuable.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is a good example of where Bergen hand evaluation works well. A lot of players would think "I have 7 HCP, not enough for a limit raise" and we would miss 4@S. But as I just said, HCP are only one factor you use when deciding how good your hand is. Distribution and fit are just as important as this hand demonstrates.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|By strict rule of 20, not using Bergen's "adjusted HCP" I have an opening bid. 10 HCP + 10 cards in the majors. But I personally prefer not to open this hand in 1st or 2nd seat. First of all, using Bergen's "adjusted HCP" I have to subtract 1 for Jx of diamonds, therefore, I no longer meet the rule of 20.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Secondly, I am reluctant to open 1 with only 10 HCP unless all my points are in my long suits. On the other hand, if you chose to open 1@S, I would not say you were wrong.|

cs|1|cp|4|fp|1|at|^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|CP||fp||at|^C@2
When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|1|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
