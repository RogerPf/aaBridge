stanira3: It is natural.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|True. The bid is natural but it does not show extra values-it is not forcing. In this bidding cycle it is unlikely Ann will pass. However, with a different hand she could. |
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


AT| 
stanira3: Ok why?|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|New suits by opener are not forcing. Only reverses and jump shifts are forcing. You reverse when you voluntarily bypass your opening bid at two level-2C here. However, although 2S seems that you bypassed your opening bid at two level but the because Ann bid 2D then the 2C was not available as a bid. So 2S in this bidding cycle is not a reverse. In order to return to clubs (opening bid), you would have to bid 3C.|

mb|2s|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But on the original auction as shown above, 2C is not available to Stan, so he cannot "voluntarily" bypass clubs. You only reverse when you voluntarily bypass your first suit at two level. On this hand Stan is showing 13-17 or so with 4 spades. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now having said that, he knows their side does not have a spade fit, because Ann did not make a negative double or bid spade. So he is likely looking for NT which is why I said, although 2S is technically not forcing, Ann will rarely if ever pass. However, Stan has a better bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Sandy was fortunate that Stan's last card was a low spade not a diamond. A good approach to playing this hand is to try and set up the spade suit before drawing trumps. So at trick 2 play a low spade and try to ruff 2 or 3 spades before drawing trump.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The important bidding point on this hand is, as usual, apply the LOTT in competitive hands. Sandy knows we have a 9-card heart fit, so 3H is the correct bid. In fact, she has such a good hand, I would bid 4H. |
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if she starts spades right away she might make 4. But the reason 4 is difficult is because I have a very weak Michaels bid. Give me another card, such as the HK or SK, and now 4H is pretty easy.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other good point off this hand is it is rarely right to lead the opponents' suit (other than sometimes leading trump).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's discuss when it is ok to compete to the 3 level. When the opponents have found an 8-card fit and voluntarily stopped at the 2 level, then it is ok to compete. But, on this hand, Sandy is not sure we have an 8-card fit. Plus she is vulnerable, has a flawed takeout double (only 2 clubs) and good defense in spades. So pass is probably best.|

{      Beginner Intermediate Lounge, Our Home      }
^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to as you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
