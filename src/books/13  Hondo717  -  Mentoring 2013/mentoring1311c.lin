^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Before I talk about the bidding let's talk about the best way to play the hand. Because of the way the diamonds split (doubleton Q) Liza luckily made 7. But there is just about a surefire way to make 6, and likely make 7. |
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is to set up dummy's diamonds. So prior to drawing trump Liza should play 2 rounds of diamonds. If they split 3-2 (68%) then she can ruff a diamond high, draw trump ending in dummy with the @H10 and claim. On this hand, once the @DQ comes down, she need not even ruff the diamond, but still can draw trump and make 7 as she did. |
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The way she played it happened to make 7, but if she plays it the way I suggest it will always make 7 when diamonds are 3-2 and 6 when they are not. An alternative line is to try and ruff 3 clubs in dummy, but that is much harder than just setting up diamonds. The main point here is she should not draw trumps immediately.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the bidding, it kind of depends on what you play. But Liza can just about bid 6@D with her hand, and not worry about 7. All Ruth needs is the @DA or @DQ for 6 diamonds to be a very good contract. So I probably would have bid 6@D in IMPs. |
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In Match Points, its a little trickier, I might bid 6@H as that scores better. But Liza definitely can picture a slam so long as Ruth as the @DA or @DQ. Thus, I will argue that the weak 2 actually made it easier to get to slam. |
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you play in diamonds then Ruth will either be short in clubs or short in hearts. if short in clubs no problem, if short in hearts you can pitch her clubs. If you play new suits over 2@D are forcing (I do not, but most people do) the Liza can bid 2@H. If you don't play that as forcing, then you can't bid 2@H. But you should be able to picture a slam is making.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out not to matter on this hand, but if Ruth did not have the @DQ, the hand would have been very hard to play after a trump lead.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally the 9 would have been right by Jacquie, but on this hand you want to eliminate trump and the @SA is right. That's why bridge is so hard. exceptions to rules.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's talk about the bidding. First of all 3@C bid.  That is a "reverse" in the sense that Ruth bypassed 2@S. The question is, does it show extra values in 2/1.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In SAYC it definitely does. But in 2/1 there are a couple of options. You could play that it indeed shows extra values. But another way to play is that it shows either a good 4-card suit, or 5-5. The reason opener should be reluctant to bid 3@C is it takes up a lot of room. So most experts play it shows something special. In any case 3@C was the best bid by Ruth particularly since she had both 5 clubs and extra values.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is some controversy over that 3@D bid as well. Some people play it should show diamonds. Others play it is asking for a diamond stopper because with a diamond stopper Liza would normally bid 3N. I like to play it asks, but not all my expert partners agree with me. In any case, I think on this hand Liza should just bid 3N over 3@C.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's continue with the auction as it went. I know Ruth is worried that they have slam. A spade slam is out of the question once Liza bids 3@D. A club slam is possible. The reason a spade slam is not possible is Liza would bid 3@S over 3@C with 3-card support. So Ruth knows they don't have a spade fit. |
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And although Ruth has more than a min hand (15 HCP) and nice distribution she has some downgradeable features--a poor spade suit in particular and the @DAQ, although worth 6 points, is a bad feature. Honors in short suits are not worth nearly as much as honors in long suits. |
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, let's turn Ruth's @DQ into the @CQ (so she had @CAKQ) and Ruth's @DA into the @SA (so she had @SAQ). Now her hand has the same 15 points but is much much better (AQxxx x xx AKQxxx) because her long suits are likely to be much easier to set up. In any case, over 3@D I would have bid 3N with Ruth's hand and over 4@S I certainly would not have tried for slam with a known 7-card fit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, it is time to get to work. Whenever you have Kxx opposite Qxx (without the 10) there is a (very small) possibility that you can get 2 tricks in the suit. You play one person for a doubleton Ace. On this hand, let's say for some reason I decided to play Jacquie for the doubleton @DA (no reason I should, I am just saying suppose I did). |
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Then I would lead a low diamond to the K, and a low diamond back and duck it and my DQ would set up. So if you are in a desperate situation with that suit (Kxx opposite Qxx) and need 2 tricks that is the way to play it. It will work once very 5 years :). But on this hand I am trying clubs and diamonds for my 8th trick.|

up|52|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let me briefly discuss a Marty Bergen concept he calls "OBAR" bids which apply on this hand. Whenever it goes 1x-p-2x (particularly when x is hearts or spades) he feels that if the opponent just after the 2x bid (East on this hand) is short in suit x, they should take action even with very few points. |
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|He calls it "pre-balancing" or OBAR (which stands for Opponents Bid And Raise). So he would say Ruth should bid 2NT on this auction. 2NT, if you play OBAR, does not mean a strong NT. If  you think about it, that makes no sense. Even if Ruth happened to have a strong NT, that would mean her partner is very weak (since the opponents have at least half the points). |
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So 2N, there is not a strong NT. It is sort of "unusual" in that it is a takeout double for the minors. It tends to show 5-4 as opposed to 5-5 however. Ruth could also decide to make a takeout double, playing OBAR. The only flaw is she has only 3 hearts. But they are pretty good ones, so double would be acceptable as well. The main point is that OBAR allows you to compete more effectively.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now as to whether OBAR works on this hand. It probably is a neutral result. We make 2@S, and E/W are down in 3 of a red suit. But in general, if it goes 1x-p-2x-p-p-p, you will not do well on the hand. if you do average consider yourself lucky. Most of the time you will be below average.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Makes 7 because clubs are 3-3. But 6N is the correct contract. You should only bid grands where you can just about count 13 tricks. If you never bid a grand you will come out ahead in the long run (but you might not have as much fun :) ).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nice bid by Ruth. Just like you should always open 1N with 15-17 balanced, you should strain to overcall 1N with 15-18 balanced. Whenever you open or overcall 1N, you very much increase the chances that your side will get to the right contract. Because your hand is much better defined than if you overcall or make a takeout double.|mb|1N|

NT||sk|s|lb|*yShould South bid 4S?^^y|mb|4S|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A good principle to follow is that 4@S over 4@H is rarely wrong if you have a spade fit. If I had a 6th spade, it would be clear because we have at least an 8 card fit. On this auction its not 100% clear we have a spade fit. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But it is quite possible, given the auction that Ruth has only 2 hearts which means it is likely she has 3+ spades given her NT bid. So not vul over vul, 4@S is a good bet. That is a bit of a problem. A good example of why a 9-card fit is so much better than an 8-card fit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If the @DA is onside I have 3 tricks already, plus 3 spade tricks, plus 1 diamond trick plus 3 club tricks. That gives me 10 tricks I think. Remember, you have to count your tricks and formulate a plan to make your contract.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) opened the BIL on  September 3, 2003 to provide the learner bridge player with a secluded place to attend lessons , mentoring sessions  and hosted practice sessions free from interruptions by the advanced bridge player.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
