^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here was a case where I bid what I thought I could make. I believe in the "no accident" theory of bidding when it is appropriate. That means make the clearest bid you can if you are pretty sure it is the place where you want to end up and my judgement was 3N was very likely to be where we would end up, and 6@C was fairly unlikely given the spade overcall.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the lead, a heart could be right, but I would have led a spade. As I tell my partners "You never lose the postmortem if you lead my suit." It builds partnership trust, if nothing else, even if it turns out there was a better lead.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good bid by Ruth. Just like you should always open 1NT with a balanced 15-17 count, you should overcall 1NT with 15-18 and a stopper in opener's suit. The 1N opener or overcall is very descriptive. and auctions that start with 1NT almost always result in your side reaching the best contract. By the way, that is why I like the weak NT because the same could be said playing a weak NT.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is the correct play. In general, as defender you play the lower of equals to inform partner about your holding. But as declarer you want to hide your high cards, so you do the opposite, play the highest of equals to hide your high cards. By playing the ace neither defender is sure who has the King. But if Ruth had played the King, then both defenders would know she had the ace. So remember that it is good technique as declarer to play the highest of equals to hide your holding.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is difficult, but neither Ruth nor Jacquie kept track of the club spots. Turns out the @C7 was good, so Jacquie should have ruffed and once she did not Ruth should have pitched. Further, As you see we ended up in our best spot due to the 1N overcall.|

However, you should strain to pre-empt when not vul against vul opps, specially in the 2 best seats, 1st and 3rd because those are the conditions which most favor a successful preempt.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I believe that is 4th best, then I know a lot about the heart suit. I know Ruth has 2 hearts because my 5 hearts + pard's 4 hearts plus dummy's 2 hearts = 11 hearts (or Rule of 11 if you wish). I also know that Ruth has at least 1 card higher than the 9 because I cannot see the @HQJ10. With the @HQJ10 Liza would have led the @HQ.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me comment briefly on the play. Ruth knows once she loses the lead, the defense will win 4 heart tricks. So in order to make 3N she cannot lose the lead before taking 9 tricks. She can count 5 clubs, 1 heart and 2 spades for 8 sure tricks.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If we couldn't take 4 heart tricks, then obviously the best play for a 9th trick is to knock out the @DA. But if she does that early, she will go down. So her only hope is that the spade finesse works. And since that is the case, she might as well keep all her spades and throw diamonds on clubs (see tricks 6 and 7).|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If the spade finesse works and they are 3-3, she can take 5 spade tricks and if the spade finesse loses, it doesn't matter that she kept diamonds. On this hand Ruth should actually make 11 tricks. It does not matter much with IMP scoring (2 imps) but it matters a great deal in Match Point scoring.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let me discuss New Minor Forcing and its variants. Basic New Minor Forcing works as follows. Partner opens 1 of a minor, you respond 1 of a major and partner rebids 1N (or 2N). If you then bid the other minor (2@D on this hand because Ruth opened 1@C) that is completely artificial. It asks the 1N bidder about the major suit holdings and says nothing about the bid minor. |
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 1N bidder has 4 choices.

First choice is to show 3-card support for responder's major (if opener had 4-card support they would have raised immediately). On this hand Ruth's first obligation is to show 3-card spade suit (with 4 spades she would have bid 2@S instead of 1N).|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Second choice is to show 4 hearts. Jacquie could have a hand with 5 spades and 4 hearts.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Third choice is to bid 2N with 12/bad 13 points or bid 3N with a good 13/14 points. BTW, you need an invitational hand at least to bid New Minor Forcing.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, Ruth should have bid 3N, not 2N because she has a good 14 with a very nice 5-card side suit. |

The idea behind 2/1 is to conserve bidding space when exploring for slam. So if you make a bid that takes up a lot of space, such as 3@S, you better have a good reason. Experts play that the 3@S bid conveys the following message:|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It does not necessarily show 16 points per se, although when you have good spades your hand usually counts to at least that. A @SAKQ10xx is 100% self sufficient. Since voids are so rare, you can assume pard has a singleton, so even a @SAKJ10xx holding is pretty close to a self sufficient suit. So we can let your 3@S stand.|mb|3S|

^-|CP||CS||FP||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Personally, I prefer "Checkback Stayman" to New Minor Forcing, although most BBO players prefer NMF. "Checkback Stayman" is very similar to New Minor Forcing, except 2@C is always the bid responder uses to ask the 1N bidders about their majors. So, if it goes|

HT|e|va|4|at|^m@2^Z@3and you play Checkback Stayman, 2@C is not a club preference. It is asking the 1N bidder about their majors, the same as those who play NMF. To play "Checkback Stayman" unlike in NMF, the responder does not need at least an invitational hand to make a 2@C bid.
|
PG| ***** 143 ***** |


ht|j|at|^B@2
This is a big advantage because responder to notrump bid by opener has more freedom to choose his next bid after a 2@D bid for example. A 2@D rebid by opener denies 3 card support for responder's major and 4 cards in the other major. For example if the opener in the above auction bids 2@D, then the responder with a weak hand can place the final contract in 2@H or 2@S as you see below.|

With an invitational hand, over the 2@D response to 2@C, the Checkback bidder could bid 2N as you will see below.|

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
