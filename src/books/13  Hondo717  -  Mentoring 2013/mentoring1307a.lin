Some people play you should not open without some quick tricks (some say 2, others say 2.5) but, as you know, the rule of 20 is my sole criteria for opening. And the quick trick requirements have pretty much been scrapped by most people. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I prefer to play that 2@S here by me promises 6 spades. However, some people just use it as the "default bid" meaning it doesn't promise 6, merely nothing more to say. Actually, I have 2 choices here, 2@S or 3@D. I prefer 2@S as being more economical and showing my 6th spade.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


mb|p|sk|n|NT||lb|*bPlease make a bid for North.^^3s|mb|3S|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ruth is making a spade slam try. She has 2 or 3 spades (more likely 3) because she is making a slam try. With a minimum game force, she bids 4@S which is weaker than 3@S. We will look at this bid again after the play.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


mb|p|sk|s|NT||lb|*bPlease make a bid for South.^^4C|mb|4C|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now my hand is quite good. The only fly in the ointment is I am void in Ruth's 5+ card heart  suit (2@H promises 5+). Let me count my Declarer Points. 14 HCP, 2 length points, 3 point for void (normally I would count 4 for the void, but I am going to discount 1 pt because it is in hearts), 1 quality suit, and 1 for a 4 card side suit = 21.  |
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is certainly enough  for slam. The problem is if I bid 4N with a void I won't know if one of Ruth's key cards is the @HA or not. So this is a tough hand to bid. Nevertheless, I will start with 4@C, control in clubs. Playing Italian style control bidding, you show first or second round controls (A, K, singleton, or void).|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


mb|p|sk|n|NT||lb|*bPlease make a bid for North.^^4D|mb|4D|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ruth's 4@D bid is correct. If she bid 4@H she would be denying a control in diamonds. And a singleton counts as a control.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


mb|p|sk|s|NT||lb|*bPlease make a bid for South.^^4S|mb|4S|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I still have a problem. 4@D could be the @DA, which is great or it could be diamond shortness which is not so great. Had Ruth not bid hearts, I could bid 4H control bid because I have a void. But once partner shows a natural suit, you no longer bid shortness, only aces and kings, in their suit because shortness usually is not useful in their suit. |
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, I hate to bid 4@S. But I guess I will, leaving to Ruth to see if she wants to go on. I made 1 slam try. She needs 3 of the @DA, @CA, @SK, and @SQ for 6@S to make which is not that likely.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have been in worse slams, that was 50%. One kib made an interesting and good suggestion. He suggested Ruth bid 4@D (splinter) over 2@S. That would show diamond shortness, slam interest and 3-card support. The reason it does not show 4-card support is because you should bid Jacoby 2N over a major suit opener with 4-card support. Failure to bid 2N denies 4 spades. Further, normally a splinter shows 4 card support, but Ruth denied 4-card support already by not bidding 2N.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that, diamond shortness is not useful to me with my holding and we end up in 4@S. That is actually probably where we should be. 6@S is a bit aggressive.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Jake: If Ruth had 4 card @S support and a stiff @D, her first response would have been 4@D.... As it was a delayed spinster it now promises only 3 spades.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One kib also asked why I did not bid 3@S to show extra strength. It turns out 3@S has a very specific meaning in a 2/1 auction. It does not promise 16+ as you might think. The auction 1S-P-2H-P-3S means the following:|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I strongly believe you should open 1N with any 15-17 balanced hand, even with a 5-card major. It is true that you will occasionally miss a 5-3 fit, but quite often 3N plays just as well as 4S when you have 8 spades.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


mb|p|sk||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now you can see what trouble you would have been had you opened 1@S.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


mb|3N|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Playing 2/1, over 1S, West would bid 1NT. East should bid 2@D (2N would be a big overbid, since West can have as few as 6 points). West might choose to just bid 2S, and then it would be very hard for E/W to get to their 3N bid. So, as this hand illustrates, it is very hard to show your points when you open 1 of a major with 15-17 and partner responds 1NT, you are better off opening 1NT to start with.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If Mary passes it probably goes 1S-2C. I would like to bid 2@D with Liza's hand, but she is a tad weak. Let's say she bids 2@D.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding was fine. Not a terrible contract. One further comment. 3@C is a tad aggressive. Given I bid 2N the singleton diamond may not be that useful. I could have as much as 18 HCP and a 4-card major. But I could also have a good 15 or 16. And also, if I bid 3D, North is forced to bid 3N and we could easily have 21 or 22 HCP and don't have more than 24. So on further consideration I think pass is probably better with the North hand.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NThe "story" is way over my head but I always try to read whatever Karen writes. This article in July 2013 edition of Bridge Bulletin greatly helped me understand my confusion and frustration playing 2/1 with different partner. Now I know why I get scolded by upper classmen and women when playing 2/1. |
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


AT|

To me playing bridge is just like being in the armed forces in the battlefield. The person is free to cut you down and order you around when she/he has a higher rank. They can even stop and scold you because you did not properly salute. On the other hand, I probably don't know 2/1 and merely trying to find excuses. Regardless, you may find Karen's article helpful particularly since Howard also has great commentaries. Next is her article along with Howard's notes. You can read the article from ACBL web site if you are a member.|

^-|FP||cp||cs||AT|
When I learned bridge, my aunt taught me old-fashioned Goren, which was played by most everyone in the casual games on my college campus. Then I discovered duplicate and a host of "revolutionary" ideas - limit raises, negative doubles, weak two-bids - that were relatively simple improvements.|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


AT|

The next big change was the 2/1 system, which gained popularity so fast that it became difficult to find a partner who wanted to play any other system. That was fine with me. I thought 2/1 was even easier to adopt than "duplicate standard."|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


AT|

I soon learned that although the basic premise of 2/1 is simple enough, the auctions can become quite complicated and some types of hands are almost impossible to describe. Those flaws - and the superiority of standard methods - were the focus of Frank Stewart's article in the May Bridge Bulletin. On the other side of the debate was Larry Cohen, who argued that 2/1 is the more accessible, effective choice for even new players.|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


AT|

Whichever view you support, there's no question that 2/1 is the dominant system in club and tournament bridge. Its fans believe it has clear advantages over standard bidding, but most recognize that the system is far from perfect. Can it be improved? The first step is understanding the source of the problems, which fall into three categories: ^*BSystem definition^*N, ^*BUser error^*N and ^*BDesign weaknesses^*N. I will cover the first two.|
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


AT|

^*B1. System definition^*N
A common misconception is that 2/1 has a universal set of clearly defined meanings for early responses and rebids. It would be convenient if you could say "2/1?" to a new partner and be confident that you're playing the same system, but you can't.|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


AT|

^*BLawrence, Hardy or ...?^*N
There are several ways to structure 2/1 systems, and it's helpful to be aware of the variations. Several authors - including Mike Lawrence, Max Hardy, Marty Bergen, Paul Thurston and Eric Rodwell/Audrey Grant - have published books and software that outline their versions of the system.|

^-|FP||cp||cs||AT|
The two most widely used approaches are from Lawrence and Hardy, who differ in their recommendations for some of opener's rebids. In general, Lawrence emphasizes value rebids that define opener's strength. Hardy includes more rebids that show distribution, but do not pinpoint strength.|
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


AT|

Even simple sequences can be misinterpreted if you're playing one style and your partner is playing the other. After the auction 1@H-Pass-2@C, for example, does opener promise six or more cards if he rebids 2@H? He almost always does if he's a Hardy player, but not if he's using the Lawrence structure. For the differences, see "Questions to ask your 2/1 partner."|
PG| ***** 140 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|I prefer the Max Hardy style of 2/1, where you show distribution rather than strength. As you know, I strongly believe in the LOTT, which means that suit length can be just as important as HCP. Therefore I think it is important to describe your suit length. In particular, if opener rebids their major after a 2/1 response, I think it is much better if that promises a 6-card major. A 2N bid by opener is the "default" bid, meaning that opener will bid that if he has nothing else he can bid, sometimes without stoppers in one of the unbid suits. Lawrence believes rebidding the major should be the "default" bid and is often done with a 5-card suit. I strongly disagree.|

^*BMisunderstandings about "game level"^*N
Your partnership can agree that "forcing to game" means any game, including minors, but most 2/1 pairs believe that's taking the system name too seriously.|
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


AT|

Responder will consider any good 12-point hand a game force, so the partnership's combined strength may be only 24-25 high-card points when opener holds a minimum. That's (barely) enough to make 3NT, 4@H or 4@S. A minor-suit game requires considerably more power, and when you don't have it, you need to be able to stop below the five level. That's why the practical definition of "forcing to game" is "forcing to 3NT or the four level."|
PG| ***** 143 ***** |


AT|

This can be an issue in auctions where you don't have a major-suit and you've been unsuccessful in finding stoppers for notrump. Unless one of you has shown extra values earlier in the auction, a bid of four of a previously bid minor suit may be just a retreat that can be passed.|

^*B2. User error - saving too much space^*N
One of the big benefits of 2 1 auctions is that neither partner has to jump to show forcing values. The bidding can stay low, allowing more room to exchange information below game level and evaluate slam possibilities.|
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


AT|

That benefit can become a pitfall if an auction has what The Bridge World calls "two temporizers and zero describers." This happens when one or both partners are so intent on conserving space that they make every rebid at the lowest level possible, no matter what their strength. The result is that they learn a lot about each other's distribution, but very little about suit quality and high-card strength.|
PG| ***** 146 ***** |


AT|

Stewart called this problem his "biggest gripe" about 2/1 and cites it as proof that the basis of the system is flawed. Most of the failures can be blamed on the bidders. not the system. Two-over-one bidding is most accurate if you agree that responder does not jump with extra values, but opener may.|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


AT|

In most 2/1 auctions, responder is the "asker" (temporizer) and opener is the "teller" (describer). When responder has slam aspirations, he uses forcing, low-level rebids to give opener room to provide more information. This is the principle of fast arrival - responder's fast rebids (jumps to game) show minimums; slow (low-level) raises and notrump rebids tend to show extras. Opener, however, makes value bids whenever possible - he bids higher with stronger hands, lower with minimums. Rebids that show extra values include jumps in his suit or notrump and (in Lawrence style) reverse rebids. The sooner opener can make one of these bids, the easier it is for responder to determine the partnership's combined strength. |
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|I am neutral about whether a reverse by opener (e.g 1@H-P-2@C-P-2@S) should show extra values or not. I used to play it does show extra values. Marty Bergen, and I would guess a majority of 2/1 players, play it does not. I currently play it does not show extra values, and that seems to work out fine, but if a partner wanted to play it does show extras, I have no problem with that approach.|

^*BOveruse of the forcing 1NT^*N

^-
@SQ4 @HAJ43 @DA62 @CQ764,
^-|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


AT|
but the alternative - a forcing 1NT - can leave you with awkward choices later in the auction.|
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


AT|

If you respond 1NT with this hand and partner rebids 2@C, 2@D or 2@H, you have no forcing bid available. Your only option is a unilateral jump to game, which prevents you from learning anything more about partner's hand. You'll also have trouble communicating your strength if partner makes a jump shift or if the opponents enter the auction.|
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


AT|

You can avoid these problems by limiting your forcing 1NT range to a maximum of a bad 12 points. When you hold game values, establish the force right away by choosing a 2/1 response, even with a weak suit.|

^*B"Auto" cuebidding^*N

Some 2/1 auctions will be so efficient that you'll be left with bidding space you don't need, and there's often a temptation to fill it just because it's there. Here's an auction that causes problems for many pairs:|
PG| ***** 162 ***** |

st||pn|You,,Partner,|md|1SKJT82 HKJ85 DA72 C6,,,|sv|o|rh||ah|Karen Walker D|mb|1sp2cp2hp|NT|^B@2
You hold the hand as shown above with the bidding.|
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


mb|3h|AT| Partner's raise to 3@H is slow arrival, suggesting at least moderate extra values. You have room to make a "free" control cuebid on the way to game, so you could try 4@D, just in case partner was planning to head for 6@H.|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


NT|^B@2
To partner, though, 4@D will sound like a serious move toward slam. He'll cooperate by cuebidding 4@S or 5@C and you'll be propelled to 5@H - if you can stop there - with what may be an ordinary fit and only 26 HCP.|
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The first partner to offer a cuebid in this type of auction should be promising something extra (a strong 14+ points). With a dead minimum, just raise to game and let partner decide if his hand warrants a try. If he has enough to make 6V opposite the hand above, he'll bid again.|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Where Karen says if the auction goes 1@S-2C-2@H-3@H-?, opener should only control bid with extra values, that is reasonable. However, experts have a method to have it both ways. They play a convention called "serious 3NT". |

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|If opener rebids 3NT over 3H, that say "partner, I am very interested in slam and want you to control bid".

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
