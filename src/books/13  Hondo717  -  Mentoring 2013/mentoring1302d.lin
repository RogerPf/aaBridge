^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's discuss the bidding. Ann has 19 Starting Points (16 HCP, 2 length 1 quality suit = 19). 3@D bid is just at the top of the range (17-19) but a bit misleading. Sandy might pass with 5 spades and a singleton diamond and you could easily miss 4S (which you did).|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Instead I would bid 3C. That is forcing to game. Then Sandy can bid 3H and Ann is confident now Sandy has 5 spades, and can bid 4S. On the other hand, 3N is an ok contract, as we can never take more than 4 hearts no matter what.|

anniebmisc: Should I be thinking diamond slam?|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes Ann, if Sandy has a diamond fit with you, your double fit in diamonds and spades makes a slam quite possible. However, on this hand, if the @DJ does not come down in 3 rounds, a diamond or spade slam is difficult. With a 7-card fit, the odds of the Jack coming down are 50% (either 2 or 3 to the J). So a spade or diamond slam is a bit aggressive, but I have been in worse.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Stan has enough points to make a DONT bid, but unfortunately he is not distributional enough. Whenever it goes 1N-P-P-?, you should strain to bid DONT with the right distribution even with few points. In fact, although this is far from obvious, in balancing seat, you would prefer to have fewer points. |
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason for that is when it goes 1N-P-P, the points are pretty evenly spread. If 4th seat has fewer points, that implies 2nd seat has more points. And it is better for 2nd seat to have more HCP, as they are sitting behind the NT bidder.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Balancing is very misunderstood. I know a lot of teachers say "borrow a king from partner" and add that to your HCP to see if you should balance. But that is not really correct. A better way to look at it is that the points are evenly spread. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, in balancing seat, if you have fewer points, pard has more points. When balancing you are bidding based on the partnership assets, not just what is in your hand. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A couple of points on the bidding. I would pass with Ann's hand. The LOTT says so. Yes, 3D happens to make, but that is because the @DQ and @HK were both onside and that means we are going down. However, once Ann bids 3D, Sandy has enough to double again. Remember, if they have a fit, we have a fit. It turns out because they only have an 8 card fit, we are not guaranteed an 8 card fit. |
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And in fact we have three 7-card fits. But Sandy still should double again. With a singleton diamond, and being non-vul, the risk is small. It turns out both Stan and Ann have maximum for their bids.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me outline the correct bidding sequence. Once Ann bids 2C, that establishes a game force. The advantage is now when there is a potential slam, the partnership can go slowly. However, the converse is also true. Once a game force is established, the principle of fast arrival also works.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|"Fast Arrival" means, the faster you bid game the weaker your hand (given you made a game force). On this hand, Ann has the weakest hand she can have for a game force. Therefore, her correct bid in 2/1 is 4S ("fast arrival") to show a weak hand with no slam interest unless Stan has a monster hand. In that case Stan can bid on.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As far as West is concerned Ann is theoretically showing slam interest. West has 16 Declarer Points (13 HCP - 1 for dubious KQ plus 1 length point + 1 quality suit = 14 Starting Points) and (Declarer add ons are 1 for the 2 doubletons and 1 for the 4 diamonds). So an expert West, with that many points, should cooperate and bid 3C (club control) to show slam interest.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With less points, say 13 or so declarer points, Stan should also invoke fast arrival and bid 4S. Therefore, the correct bidding sequence should be|Ub|8|

Her best bet is to hope the @CQ is onside. So after  drawing trump she should cash the @CA (in case the @CQ is singleton). Then get to the board with a diamond to the Jack not the King, so she doesn't block the suit and take the club finesse, which happens to lose.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
