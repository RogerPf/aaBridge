^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some comments. Sandy should not double for 2 reasons. She would love them to play in hearts rather than clubs and she does not have good enough spots where she really wants me to lead a heart. She should either pass or bid 3S. My choice would be 3S as a law of total tricks bid.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Judy made a very nice 3NT bid which Stan should be very happy about. Now his @sQ is worth something, since Judy is showing spade points. He has a nice heart suit which could easily generate 3 or 4 tricks. And he has clubs making it likely their side has lots of club tricks. So pass is very clear. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is almost never right to play in 5 of a minor vs. 3N, unless you are sure the opponents can run a suit. That is a very important bidding principle. If you think 3N has plays, bid it rather than 5 of a minor.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 3N, on the heart lead, they take 3 hearts, 5 clubs, 1 diamond, and 1 spade at least.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's talk about 5C. That should make as well, actually 6. Judy did well to win the @HA and draw trump. But now she should simply play the @HJ setting up dummy's @HQ 10. She can pitch her losing spade and 1 diamond and cross ruff the hand for 12 tricks.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|She also should not lose the @CK. I missed that in the play. If she just played the @CA after winning the @CQ, if she counts out clubs, she can figure out the cK will drop under her Ace.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One thing you need to keep in mind when analyzing a hand. Just because a hand makes (or goes down) does not mean the contract should be bid (or not bid). You cant be a results player. You have to decide if the percentages favor the contract. If they do, you should be there. If they do not you should not be there.|

UP|28|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although it turns out I am making 5 clubs Sandy should not bid it. She should picture my hand as AQ 8th of clubs and out which means she can only count 10 tricks at best-8 clubs, 1 spade and 1 diamond. I happen to have the @DK but that is just lucky not to mention my singleton heart.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I had the same hand with 2 hearts and 1 spade, it goes down. Basically here is a good rule of thumb when partner preempts and you are trying to decide whether or not to go on. Picture partner with AQ of trumps and the requisite number (6-card suit over weak 2, 7-card suit over opening 3, 8-card suit over opening 4) and count how many tricks you can take.|

athni: Can West double your 4C bid?|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Stan has a difficult choice after 4C. Since Judy passed and Stan only has 12 Starting Points-14 HCP (the CJ is worthless) and -1 for @DQ2-game is very unlikely. So I like pass best. If Judy had not passed I think double is slightly better. Note that double of a 4-level preempt is not pure takeout.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It says "partner I have some high cards" and "do something intelligent." Basically responder to the double should pass with a couple of defensive tricks. And only bid with shortness in the pre-empt suit and a long suit of their own.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A good rule of thumb is that on competitive hands, if you have a spade fit and they have a heart fit 4S is almost always right over 4H. Stan knows they have a heart fit, as it is very unlikely, once I bid a weak 2, that I have more than 2 or 3 hearts so he should bid 4S. It is possible that both 4H and 4S are going down. But it is more likely that it will be to our advantage. |
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We might be making 4S. They might be making 4H. Or they might bid 5H over 4S and go down 1. So with most experts 4S is almost automatic over 4H. Many people worry about what could go wrong when they make a bid. A better way to look at it is to see if it is likely that something good will happen when you bid. If the odds favor something good happening, then make the bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This was a good example of how the 4S bid worked out and why it is a good idea. It actually turns out, if I guess the @CJ, I can make 4S.|

princesess: Tell us when to bid 4 over 5 bid here.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is hard to know when to bid 5 over 4 particularly in Match Points (F2F bridge). Judy has a tough decision.
Assuming you think you have the majority of the points which is a reasonable assumption by Judy, since she has such a good hand. The question is whether to double or bid 5H. |
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You should be reluctant to bid 5 unless you have shortness in the opponents suit, which she does not. In fact based on the auction, she should assume a 9-card spade fit, which means she has 2 losers in spades. However, it is possible she has no other losers. But if Sandy has the @DA and @CK then 4S is going down. So in IMPs, I think double by Judy is best, based on her doubleton spade. In match points it is a tougher decision.  BTW, I think most players would bid 5H with Judy's hand.|

So I would have led a diamond with Stan's hand. But many experts choose a heart. However, I find leading a short suit often gives away a trick as on this hand.|

^-{            When to Sacrifice -from a mentoring session many years ago         }
^-|
fp||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss when it is good to sacrifice, and when not. For the sake of this discussion, assume the  opponents have bid a makable major suit game, and they are going to double your sacrifice.|
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


AT|

At equal vulnerability, assuming the opponents make game, down 2 is a good sacrifice, down 3 is not. For example, non-vulnerable, down 2 is minus 300, and game is 420. And if we are both vulnerable, down 2 is minus 500, and they are plus 620. Down 3, not vulnerable, is not terrible, 500 vs. 420. On the other hand, down 3 vulnerable is not good, 800 vs. 620.|
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


AT|

If you are not vulnerable and they are vulnerable, it is ok to go down 3, 500 vs. 620.|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


AT|

If you are vul and the opponents are not, it is almost never right to sacrifice. They have to be making the hand, and you can only be down 1 (200 vs. 420).|
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


AT|

In summary, the best time to sacrifice is when you are not vulnerable and they are. I would also occasionally consider a sacrifice if both are not vulnerable, particularly if you think there is a chance that you might even make the contract (for example, when both sides have fits in 2 suits). However it is rarely right to sacrifice when you are vulnerable, even if the opponents are also vulnerable.

{      Beginner Intermediate Lounge, Our Home      }
^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to as you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
