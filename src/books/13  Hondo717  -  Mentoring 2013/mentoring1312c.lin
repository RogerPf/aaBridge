Using Bergen adjust HCP it has 10 HCP + 2 quality suit points - 1 for lots of quacks = 11. 11 + 10 @H/@D = 21 more than enough to qualify for the rule of 20. However, when I have a hand with few HCP that qualifies for the rule of 20, especially in 3rd seat I will often preempt because that is a better tactical move. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We already talked about the most important point of this hand. As responder (to both overcalls and opening bids) you are usually "captain" of the auction. That means it is your responsibility to get your side to the best contract. On this hand, Liza with great spade support and 14 Dummy Points knows their side should at least be in game. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So she must make sure they get there. In fact, she should bid 4@D as a splinter, because slam is not out of the question. I opened 2@H, her partner rates to be short in hearts (since there are only 3 hearts remaining between Ruth and Jacquie). So if her partner has 3 aces and the @CQ, slam is a good bet. |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One small comment on the play. Once Ruth guesses the clubs correctly, she should make 6. At trick 8, Rather than playing a small spade to the @SJ to get to the @CJ she simply plays a diamond. Then she can ruff her 2nd diamond and throw her 3rd diamond on the @CJ. Thus only losing 1 diamond instead of 2. Regardless, slam is a so-so contract, as it depends on guessing the clubs. so 4@S is fine.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NDid you know what Howard is doing when it seems he is not at the table? Well, he either answering the private questions, discusses pros and cons with other experts attending his session, mostly friends and bridge partners, or quickly gives undo to some bids and plays which should not see the daylight -:). This material are only reflected in his chat log. On occasion when MM is not attending, he gets ahold of that precious chat log and I go mining all the pearls. This board is an example. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You did your best Jacquie. Now let's discuss whether or not Jacquie should bid DONT. As a general rule, most people are too timid when deciding whether or not to bid DONT. Any time there is a 1N opener and you have a hand that is either at least 5-4 or has a 6-card suit, you should consider DONT.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Private chat from an expert: Yes bid DONT but her partner should look for other suit-could be @D.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The major flaw with Jacquie's hand is her clubs are weak. If her @DA were the @CA I would say she has a definite DONT bid. And if she were not vul, she has a definite DONT bid even with current hand. As it is, I think DONT is a reasonable bid with her hand, but a bit risky.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out that Liza can save her. Here is why. Although in general, you are supposed to pass when you have 3 card support for pard's first suit. Liza also happens to have 3 card support for any other suit Jacquie might have and if Jacquie's suit happens to be diamonds she has 4-card support.|

Private chat by an expert: Also-u make tricky 3N or possibly 4@H.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, although Liza's pass was not incorrect, 2@D is a better bid, because sometimes they will end up in a better spot. It does turn out they are better off in spades, but that is just lucky.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |

realrowdy (Liza):  I assumed she would bid her best suit.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No Liza, she has to bid her lowest suit. You can't tell whether her lowest suit is her best suit or not. Her bid does not say the lower suit is the better suit.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Private chat: When the other suit is 5 carder, spades here, is it better to bid 2sp directly?|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, DONT is still better. With clubs and spades, regardless of which is longer, playing DONT you must bid your lowest suit.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Private chat:  What if Jacquie's clubs and spades were reversed?  What do you do if Liza bids 2@D?|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is true that if Jacquie happens to have 5 clubs and 4 spades, they were better off in clubs. But 2@D by East will work out more often than not. It will work out when Jacquie's suit is diamonds or when Jacquie's other suit is 5 cards long. Therefore, although it is possible that 2@D will result in an inferior spot, more often than not it will work out better.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT|^B@2
jacquiek (Jacquie):  Aren't DONT bids often 4 of lower suit and 5 of higher suit?|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Simple answer is no. You also bid DONT with 5-5 but you bid the lower ranking 5-card suit first.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|After all s said and done, the most important point is to use DONT frequently when you have the right distribution. it works out well more often than not. BTW, I am not a big fan of CAPP. I think DONT is way better.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me explain the 2@C bid by Liza. Over 1N Liza must take a bid. if she doesn't have 6 spades or 4 hearts, she is sometimes forced to bid a 3 card minor. If her diamonds were a lot longer, then diamonds. but if equal or only slightly better, 2@C is better as it leaves more room in the auction. Usually it doesn't matter on most hands however.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well done Liza. Let's discuss this auction, as it is a somewhat unusual 2/1 auction. First of all, playing forcing NT, if opener rebids a minor, it is often a 3-card suit. Opener's choices are to rebid a 6-card major, or bid 2@H with 4 hearts. Absent either of those, opener must bid a minor. |
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And often opener is 5-3-3-2 so the minor is only 3 cards in length. Therefore it is unusual for the 1N bidder to raise the minor. I should only do that with 5-card support and 10 points or so.|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, there are some unbalanced hands she may have with up to 17 points or so and cannot bid 3@C with 16 or 17 points--she needs 18+. So it is possible we have game on that auction from my perspective, which is why I bid 3@C, in case Liza had the 16 point hand. That is why you try to open 1NT with an intermediate opener 15-17 or so, because intermediate hands are hard to show by opener.|

With some partners that is a dangerous request, lol. But basically partner bids with a long suit but can pass if they have no good bid. Unfortunately Liza has an unclear choice.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I like 4@D personally, but you know I like to preempt :). And as you see, 4@D gave us big problems. Generally speaking, over a "card showing" double, I usually pass with a balanced hand and only bid with a nice 5 card suit or any 6 card suit. |
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In Match Points, I would pass with Liza's hand. hope for 200 or possibly 500. But in IMPs it is much less clear. They could easily be making 4 diamonds since Liza has no defense. BTW, 4@H can make but you cannot get there once East opens 4@D. Again, opening 4@D vs 1@D is a tactical decision. I tend to open preempts on marginal openers with very long suits.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NThis was the original bidding. However, let us hear how Howard discusses the bidding.|
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I will discuss the board under following three different scenarios. First let be undo a few bids.|
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


ub|4|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1. If the auction starts out 2@C-2@D-2@H-? (I was not very happy with 2@C bid and 2@H is not the right rebid, but it led to the discussion of Exclusion Blackwood). Now the trump suit is established and South would like to know how many keycards the partnership has. To do so, if playing Exclusion Blackwood, South could bid 5@C which is Exclusion Blackwood. It says, tell me about your keycards but do not count the @CA as a keycard. |MB|5cp|
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the responses to 5@C (assuming 0314 style) are:
5@D (1st step) ^E= 0 or 3 keycards
5@H (2nd step) ^E= 1 or 4 keycards
5@S (3rd step) ^E= 2 keycards no trump Queen
5N (4th step) ^E= 2 keycards with trump Queen|
PG| ***** 171 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|here, over 5@C, North would bid 5N (2 key cards, not including the @CA, plus the @HQ).|mb|5NP|
pg| ***** 172 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since I never bid grand slams unless I can count 13 tricks, as South I would simply bid 6@H.|mb|6hPPP|
PG| ***** 173 ***** |


AT| And it makes 7.|
PG| ***** 174 ***** |


NT||
cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2. If the auction starts 1@C|UB|14|
PG| ***** 175 ***** |


MB|1cp|
PG| ***** 176 ***** |


AT| (which is my recommended auction), then a possible auction (using exclusion Blackwood) is 1@H-P-5@D-P|MB|1hp5dp|
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


AT| 

(5@D by North being exclusion Blackwood for diamonds). |
PG| ***** 178 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The responses are similar (0314):
5@H (1st step) ^E= 0 or 3 keycards
5@S (2nd step) ^E= 1 or 4 keycards
5N (3rd step) ^E= 2 keycards no trump Queen
6@C (4th step) ^E= 2 keycards with trump Queen|
PG| ***** 179 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So South would respond 5@S (1 key card excluding the @DA)|MB|5sp|
PG| ***** 180 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|An optimistic South could count 13 tricks - 7 clubs, at least 4 hearts on length, 1 diamond ruff, plus 1 spade. So 7@H would be a reasonable bid on this auction.|MB|7hPPP|
PG| ***** 181 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a hand where North doesn't count points. He just "pictures" a hand South would need for 6 or 7 to make. Even if South has 5 hearts to the Jack and nothing else, 6@H is a reasonable contract. And, as noted above, it is easy for North to picture that 7@H has good plays once South shows the @HA.|
PG| ***** 182 ***** |


NT||
cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3. Here is the auction if not playing Exclusion Blackwood,|UB|8|
pg| ***** 183 ***** |


at|  Once it starts 1@C-P-1@H-P, North can picture that 6 is a good contract, using the same logic as above. The problem is, using straight RKCB, if South shows 1 key card, it could either be the @HA or the @DA. If it's the @HA, you want to be in 7@H.|
PG| ***** 184 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Fortunately, on this hand, RKCB works well. Because it can go 1@C-P-1@H-P-4N-P-5@H|MB|4np5h|AN|2 key cards no Queen|
PG| ***** 185 ***** |


at| 7@H is easy for North to bid.|mb|p7hppp|
PG| ***** 186 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If (on a different hand)|UB|6|
PG| ***** 187 ***** |


AT| South responded 5@D (1 key card)|MB|5dp|
PG| ***** 188 ***** |


AT| over 4N, then I would settle for 6@H|MB|6HPPP|

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
