^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is important to realize just because slam made does not mean you should be there. It was very lucky that 6 made. It required a 3-2 trump break, plus both minor suit finesses working. The odds were less than 15%. Generally you do not want to bid 15% slams :). So the bidding was 100% correct.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people play Lavinthal discards. That means the suit they discard delivers a message about one of the other 2 suits not played. In this case, the other 2 suits from Ruth's perspective are hearts and spades. By discarding a high diamond, Ruth is saying she likes the higher of the remaining suits, spades in this case.|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If she discarded a low diamond, that would mean she likes hearts. Some people prefer to play Lavinthal discards in NT because they don't want to waste a high card in the suit they like, as that is a potential trick. However, it is a fairly complicated system, and sometimes you have no preference for anything, so std carding with O/E is usually ok on many hands.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Jacquie has also made a Lavinthal discard. She discarded a heart-@H2, so the other 2 suits are spades and diamonds and since she discarded a low heart, that says she likes the "lower" of the remaining suits, diamonds in this case. As you can see, that system allows Jacquie to keep all her diamonds, which is why some people like Lavinthal.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is one of those rare hands where 5@C is better than 3N, but only if West finds a diamond lead. Otherwise, with a spade lead 3N is cold, and with a heart lead or club lead, it is on the heart finesse.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although in theory 5@C is better, as it depends on just the heart finesse, 3N in practice is just as good. As to whether Liza should go to 3N, she has 11 HCP, and the @SJ is somewhat dubious, but I hate to play 2N especially vul. It is only right if you make exactly 2N and not 3N.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would bid 3N with Liza's hand on the theory that the reward for making 3N vul is worth the risk. But a pass cannot be criticized and is correct in theory.|

I might double in match points, hoping that with a possible trump trick and 2 possible spade tricks, we might beat 3@H one at least and +200 could be a good result. But I think at IMPs I need to rebid my 7 card spade suit, and since Ruth showed a strong hand with clubs, I will bid 4@S. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That has the most to gain. sometimes you make high risk bids with high rewards. Just like my suggestion of 3N last hand. 4@S could be wrong, but if it is right, it has a high payoff.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One interesting principle that this hand illustrates is "the magic of voids." Hands with voids are fairly rare (you an get them 4% of the time), but it turns out they usually take many more tricks.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Jacquie has exactly and so eloquently hit upon why voids are so powerful. The diamond void eliminates the power of all 10 of the diamond HCP.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In a sense, I am playing with a 30 point deck, and therefore you could look at it as I need only 16 combined points rather than 26 to make game.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I had a question as to what Ruth should bid. Someone suggest she bid diamonds first, the higher ranking suit, so she could show clubs later. With such nice clubs and such bad diamonds, bidding 3@C is much better IMO. I need an awful lot in diamonds for that to be a good trump suit, whereas 3 small clubs would make clubs a decent trump suit for Ruth.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|To say it differently, with such bad diamonds, it is unlikely that 5@D is a good contract. I need 4 pretty good diamonds for it to be a good trump suit.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A couple of other points about Ruth's bid. Another possibility is a negative double, which on this hand would show clubs and diamonds (although only promising 4 in each suit). That would be ok, but anytime you have a suit with 4 honors, you really want to let partner know about it. So I like 3@C better than a negative double.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other problem is, is Ruth strong enough? Technically, no, particularly because the singleton spade is a bit worrisome but if she doesn't get her club suit in now, she will never get it in. |
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if you want to count Bergen starting points, she has 8 HCP + 1 length point + 1 quality suit point = 10 which is just enough to bid 3@C. On the other hand, pass would also be ok while 3@C is quite reasonable with such a nice suit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's talk about bidding a sacrifice at the 5 level. It is virtually never right to bid "5 over 5." But that is not the case here. In this case Jacquie was bidding "5 over 4" which is also often not right, but can be right under certain conditions. |
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Those conditions are if you have a nice fit and shortness in the opps suit. With a pretty nice 7 card  heart suit, Jacquie did have a nice heart fit even if pard had 1 or 2. But she was not short in spades. So 5@H was definitely a risk, particularly being vul. |
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And it turns out, assuming Liza leads clubs, 4@S is down 1 because they take 2 clubs, a club ruff and the @DK. So Jacquie made what is sometimes call a "phantom sacrifice"-she sacrificed over a game that is not making.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Liza is too strong to bid 1NT in balancing seat (e.g after 2 passes). 1NT by her would show 11-14. so she should double as she did, planning to rebid 1N over 1@S, which shows the 15-18 NT.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play there really is only 1 chance. Jacquie should count her winners. Outside of hearts, she has 3 winners, 2 spades and a diamond. Therefore, her only hope is if she can take 5 heart tricks. She should hope for a 3-3 heart break. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The odds are against it, but its her only chance. Had she played @HA, @HK, and another heart, fortune would have smiled upon her this hand :). Obviously you like to play for something better than a 36% chance (3-3 break), but a 36% chance is better than a 0% chance.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) opened the BIL on  September 3, 2003 to provide the learner bridge player with a secluded place to attend lessons , mentoring sessions  and hosted practice sessions free from interruptions by the advanced bridge player.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to as you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
