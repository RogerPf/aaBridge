anniebmisc: Guess I should have passed out my hand.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not really. Let's talk about the auction. Ann has a clear 1C opener regardless of Rule 15 or Rule 20. Some people use something called the "Rule of 15" in 4th seat. I don't particularly care for it, but it works as follows.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 4th seat, you should open if the total of your spades and HCP is 15 or greater. The idea being the hand is likely to be a part score hand, and you don't want to be outbid in spades. That may be what Ann was thinking of and her hand meets the rule of 15.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Second, I don't particularly believe in that rule anyway. I think using the rule of 20 in all seats makes the most sense. There is some merit to opening light in 3rd seat, although I do not do that either. The merit to opening light in 3rd seat is that if it goes P-P-?, it is more likely that 4th seat has an opening bid.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is always advantageous to bid first in any auction. However, the disadvantage of opening light is then pard can often not judge how high to bid, because they are not sure if you have a real opener or light opener. So the rule I use is, I open any hand that meets the rule of 20 in all positions.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What about this specific board?|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


AT| 1C-1H is fine. But Sandy has a clear 1N call over 1H. That shows a heart stopper and about 8-10 points. She is almost good enough to bid 2N, but 1N is fine. If bid they end up in 1N which should make easily. You almost never get a good result by letting the opponents play at the 1-level.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ann might reopen with a double after P-P, but Sandy is really the one who should bid.|

UP|52|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the actual auction, a 1N bid by Sandy is fine. It typically should have 1 more point, but her hearts are so good that 1N is fine not really a stretch. However, over 2D she should bid 3C. Even though theoretically Ann might only have a 3-card suit, you can assume a 4+ card suit if need be.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out that in general, pard has 4+ clubs 85% of the time. On this auction, where Stan is obviously short in clubs, it is even more likely that Ann has real clubs.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Many of you learned with a 9-card fit missing the Queen you play for the drop as opposed to finessing. On auctions with no outside information, it turns out that the drop is very slightly superior to taking the finesse (1-2%). But on many auctions you have outside information, such as this one. |
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this auction Ann has shown a 5+-card heart suit therefore, it is more likely she is short in spades. So, on any auctions where one opponent has shown a 5+-card suit, even with a 9-card fit, you should finesse the other opponent for the trump Queen.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another auction to talk about. The 2H bid by Ann was good. Although she is a tad light on points, she can upgrade her hand because of the spade singleton and very nice 6-card suit. 3D by Sandy is fine. Some might bid 3H, showing a spade limit raise, but I like 3D better. I like to only cue bid with 4-card support but many people play the cue bid only promises 3. |
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, on this hand, even if Sandy played 3H only promised 3, I like 3D better. Since she has a game forcing hand, she will bid 4S next time in any case and that will better describe her hand. It is quite possible, if Stan has very good spades and a club control, that 6S makes.|

UP|32|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another auction to discuss. First Stan's double. He has the right distribution. And given he is a passed hand the fact that he only has 9 HCP is not crucial. And being 4-3 in the majors is fine. However, the only flaw is he has 3 very bad hearts. So because he is relatively weak combined with his flawed hearts, I might choose to pass, although double is ok.|
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What about Ann? One bid that should always occur to responder after a takeout double is redouble. She does have great hearts, but redouble announces her point count, particularly since she is a passed hand. I play any bid by responder, after a takeout double, other than redouble and 2N, (which I will discuss in a minute), denies 10 points. |
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So with my pards a 1H bid would deny 10 points. However, many experts play something a bit more complicated and less intuitive. They play that responder's 1-level bids are forcing. They may be as little as 6 points, but they are unlimited in strength. |
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So 1D-x-1H shows the same thing as no double. However, and this is where it gets very counter-intuitive, they play 2 level bids are weak. So 1D-x-2C is weak, a long club suit and less than 10 not forcing. I like my approach better :).|
PG| ***** 96 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Redouble with 10 or more, any other bid shows less than 10. The only exception being 2N which is "Jordan 2N" showing a limit raise or better. So 1D-x-2N is a limit raise in diamonds. But other than that, redouble with 10 or more. Any other bid is less than 10.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because I do get extra trump tricks by ruffing clubs as I explained. Ruffing in the hand with shorter trumps gives me extra tricks. Aside from the 6 hearts I am entitled to with my 6 card suit, I get 2 extra heart tricks by ruffing 2 clubs in dummy.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand is a great example of how you can take 8 heart tricks by ruffing in the short hand. Ruffing in the short hand gives you extra trump tricks.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding was fine. The 3S by Ann was correct for 2 reasons. Remember my rules for bidding 3 over 3 (e.g 3S over 3H);|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


AT|

a) if you have a 9 card fit (and Ann knows they have a 9-card spade fit or b) if you have a singleton or void in their suit (and Ann has a singleton heart).|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Those are the times when you should bid 3 over 3. Ann happened to have a hand that met both criteria, but either criteria is fine for bidding 3 over 3. There is another good principle to follow on this hand.|
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is often right to bid 4S over 4H, particularly at equal or favorable vulnerability. Even on this hand it might work out ok, despite the 4-0 break. If Ann guesses the club suit, she loses 2 diamonds, 2 hearts, and 2 spades, for down 3. And on a good day she will lose only 1 spade. Therefore, strain to bid 4S over 4H.|

PG| ***** 155 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Generally, when one of the majors would be the trump suit, I open a strong unbalanced hand if I count 9 tricks in my hand. I am more careful and would like to have ten tricks in my hand when one of the minors would be the trumps suit.|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The hand barely has 8.5 tricks-2 clubs for sure, 1/2 in hearts, and 5 or 6 at the most in diamonds.|
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, in case of diamonds when it goes 2C-P-2D you have to bid 3D with your long dominant diamonds suit resulting the weaker hand to play it. Therefore, bidding one of the minors instead of 2C probably would be a better choice in many instance.|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Marty Bergen uses the "4-4" rule for 2C opening when one of the majors would be the trump suit. The "4-4" says you can open a hand 2C when you have 4 or more Quick Tricks and 4 or less losing tricks. In counting his losing tricks he does not follow the standard Losing trick Count. |
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this hand even if the diamonds were a major it would not fit his "4-4" rule. The hand has 4 or more Quick Tricks but also has more than 4 losers-1 in spades, 3 in hearts, and 1 in clubs.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to as you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
