^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over 2@S, 3@H was clear. In fact, with such a nice distributional hand and nice hearts, I would consider 4@H. Had Liza reversed her clubs and spades, giving her @Sx @HAQJxxx @DA10xx @CQJ then 4@H would be a very good bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Jacquie should raise using the LOTT. However, her hand is not as good as it looks. As it turns out, her @SK is quite useful, but in general it is likely to not be useful. And since Ruth did not raise to 3@S, it is likely Liza has 2 or 3 spades. Having said all that, with 5 hearts the LOTT says to bid 4@H.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding was fine. I will discuss my options in a moment. Jacquie should bid 4@H. I am just saying she should not be surprised if it goes down. In general the @SK would bid much more useful as the @DK or the @CK.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What I should bid. My hand actually does meet the rule of 20 and could be opened 1@S. However, in 3rd seat, preempting is particularly useful since the other 2 players passed, and I only have 10 HCP, it is very likely that Liza has a good hand. So in 3rd seat, on borderline hands where you might open 1 or 2, opening 2 is usually a better tactic than opening 1. Even in 4th seat, I would open this hand 2@S.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Opening 2@S in 4th seat is a whole different matter. It is not exactly a preempt. It shows a minimish opening hand (up to 13 or 14 HCP) with a 6 card suit. The idea is game is unlikely unless we have a nice fit. So opening 2@S is both an obstructive bid for the opponents and a descriptive bid for us you don't want to do it with too weak a hand or too strong a hand. But a minimish hand with a 6 card suit is a good candidate for opening 2 in 4th seat.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What I would do with my hand in 1st or 2nd seat? In 1st seat I would still probably preempt and open 2@S. The reason is, first seat is the 2nd most effective seat for preempting after 3rd seat. 2 of the opponents have not yet bid, and only my partner has not yet bid, so it is more likely the oppose have the strength than your side does. You want to preempt when your side is weaker than the opposition. |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you could know your partner has a strong hand, you would not want to preempt, as that makes it harder when the hand is yours. But in 1st seat, the odds still favor that, when you have a weakish hand, their side is more likely to be stronger. In 2nd seat, however, that is no longer true. You have one passing opponent who is known to be relatively weak. Therefore, it is more likely partner could have a good hand. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not saying don't preempt in 2nd seat. You absolutely should. But when you have a marginal preempt, then in 2nd seat it might be better to not preempt if you have another good choice. So in 2nd seat, I would open my hand 1@S.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are special rules when bidding over 1NT overcall. Unlike over any other overcall, new suits by responder are not forcing. In fact they show a weakish hand, just willing to compete. If, for example the auction had gone 1@H-1@S-2@D by Ruth, that would have obviously been forcing. But the auction 1@H-1NT-2@D shows a weakish hand with long diamonds. |
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With a stronger hand Ruth would double. As to whether I would have bid 2@D vul with Ruth's hand, given her so-so 5-card suit, is not clear I probably pass and not bid 2@D. But 2@D is ok. |
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With usually 9 or more points, Ruth should double. The idea in bidding over 1NT is somewhat similar to what you do when it goes 1x-dbl-?. You redouble with a strong hand, and all other bids are weak. Similarly over 1NT, bids are weak, double is how you show a stronger hand.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next, let's discuss the play. Ruth can count on 3 diamond tricks if they are 4-2, 4 diamonds if they are 3-3, 2 clubs, and 1 spade. So she is probably going down 1 or 2. Personally, I would have pulled a 3rd trump with her hand, just in case they were 3-3.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the defense, the spade lead was the best lead. However, in a suit contract, you lead high from a 2 card honor sequence, so Jacquie should have led the @SQ and Liza, when she gets in with a heart should definitely avoid playing hearts. I think her best play is the @SK and another spade. There is no point in setting up dummy's hearts. Partner is likely to have natural trump tricks since Ruth stopped drawing trumps.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So all setting up hearts will do is allow Ruth to pitch losers while Jacquie ruffs with trump tricks she was entitled to any way. You normally don't want partner ruffing with natural trump tricks. Against best defense, 2@D should be down 2 - 200. I would guess E/W makes 1NT or 2NT. So -200 is 3 imps or so worse than letting them play 1N which is why I said I probably would not bid 2@D with Ruth's hand. Down 2 not vul is not so bad. But down 2 vul is usually a below average result in a part score hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is some controversy about Liza's bid. As I mentioned last hand, I play that any bid other than redouble (and 2NT which is a Jordan limit+ raise) shows less than 10 points. I think that is the easiest to remember and makes the most sense. Liza, your bid was fine. I am just discussing what it shows.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some experts, however, play a much more confusing style. They play 1-level bids over a double are forcing and unlimited. They may be weakish but they could be 10+ points and they play they are forcing. However (and this is what I think is confusing) they play 2-level bids are definitely weak and not forcing. So the auction 1@H-x-1@S potentially shows a stronger hand and is forcing. But the auction 1@H-x-2@C shows a weak hand and is not forcing. |
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I suggest you play what I do. With 10+ points you redouble or bid Jordan 2N as a limit+ raise. Any other bid is less than 10 and not forcing. BTW, I also play Bergen Raises over a takeout double (and therefore Jordan 2N shows a 3-card limit raise since 3@C shows a 4-card raise). However, that is optional. The important point is that bids other than redouble and Jordan 2N are less than 10.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Liza should have a nice spade suit, since Ruth's bid ostensibly shows spades. With a 3rd spade and minimum hand I might pass. I would think double would be penalty there or at least a strong hand willing to defend 2@C.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have 5 hearts and 1 spade trick. Need to find a couple more. It is unlikely with a trump lead I will get a club ruff and it is also unlikely the @CA is onside. My hopes for extra tricks are the @SA being onside and the @CA being tripleton. So let's start with preserving an entry to dummy.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This auction is a good example of when a trump lead is likely to be a good lead. When declarer has bid 2 suits and dummy has shown a preference for 1 of them dummy is often short in the 2nd suit and not particularly long in the preferred suit.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nice play Jacquie. That was a tough hand to play and most would go down 1. Jacquie can count 4 hearts 1 spade and 2 diamond for sure. She needs 2 more. One possibility is the @CA is onside, or the @CQJ. The second possibility is clubs are 3-3.|

On the other hand, I will still reluctantly reopen with a double because letting them play 2@C is not usually going to work well for our side. But perhaps I will get lucky.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a good bid by Jacquie even though it turns out we have a better contract. I rate to have 4 diamonds. In fact, some people would open 1@C with my hand. But I play "better minor" but others play you always open 1@C with 3-3 in the minors. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Either is reasonable. I am not a fan of "short club." Some people like to play 1@D promises 4 diamonds, so with 4-4-3-2 distribution they open 1@C. Even if you play that, responder with < 6, even if short in clubs, should NOT bid because even playing short club, when you open 1@C, most of the time you have 4+ clubs believe it or not.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As I said, Jacquie's bid of 2@D was better than bidding 2@S even though on this hand we happen to have an 8-card spade fit. More often we will have an 8+ card diamond fit, and less than an 8 card spade fit. Ruth's bidding was fine. But she is barely strong enough to double and correct to clubs if she so chooses.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I already discussed the play. As to the bidding, Ruth should probably pass rather than double because she does not have a good alternative when pard bids 1@H.

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) opened the BIL on  September 3, 2003 to provide the learner bridge player with a secluded place to attend lessons , mentoring sessions  and hosted practice sessions free from interruptions by the advanced bridge player.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to as you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
