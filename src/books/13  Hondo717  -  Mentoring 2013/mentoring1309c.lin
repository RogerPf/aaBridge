^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It was a good contract. Everyone bid it correctly. It turns out because of the bad fit (2 clubs in each hand) it is on the diamond finesse. And even a 50% game is perfectly reasonable to bid.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some would open my hand 1NT. but I like to have the classic distributions to do so (5-3-3-2, 4-4-3-2, or 4-3-3-3). Their argument would be I have no good bid over 1@H or 1@S. My counter argument would be is that 1NT is a very precise bid and once it starts losing precision it loses some of its value. For example, partner would have a right to expect I have at least one 3-card major, and on this hand I don't.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ugh. This might be our hand, and maybe I should double, but I can't. Here is my thinking. My partner is short in hearts (I have 2, they have a 10-card fit) and she passed over 1@H, so she can't have much. If I were playing face to face bridge, I would double because even the extra 50 points for setting them 1 would be good. But playing IMPs, vul against not, if they make they get an extra 140 points (590 vs. 420). So unless I am pretty sure I am setting them 1 and possibly 2, double is not a good bet.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding again was fine. Some South's might decide to get too aggressive and bid 5@D which is why 4@H is a good bid. It turns out if we play 4@D we are down 1, but that is hard to know.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people asked whether Ruth should make a negative double. I would say she is a bit weak. On the plus side, her singleton heart is very nice, and she has a diamond fit with me. But she really only has 3 working HCP (the @HJ might as well be the @H2). Some people would argue she has 6 Bergen Dummy Points with the diamond fit, and therefore has enough for a negative double. |
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In fact, if she were to bid, I think 2@D is probably better as it is more preemptive. But I personally prefer the pass. But if one of my partners chose to make a negative double with ruth's hand, I would not say they were crazy.|

PG| ***** 45 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because a pre-empt is disrupting the opponents. If you also have a weak hand, there is no reason to disrupt the opponent who already has announced they have a weak hand. You would not be disrupting them.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A very interesting hand. My guess is in an average duplicate game we would get an average result. Half the pairs would get to slam and we would beat them. And some would bid 5@D. But it is hard to say for sure. but certainly in theory the law worked well on this hand. The truth is world class players hate when us lesser mortals use the law to make it hard for them to bid :).|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) opened the BIL on  September 3, 2003 to provide the learner bridge player with a secluded place to attend lessons , mentoring sessions  and hosted practice sessions free from interruptions by the advanced bridge player.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
