April 24, was the last night for a memorable Howard's mentoring session
Sandy, Ann, and Stan being the star mentees
It was, however, a unique thrilling experience for the old Movie Maker
They gave the old MM thrills, chuckle, cringes, and challenges with their Unconventional Widdie bridge
For six month every week for several hours they were my companion
In my movies I loved to praise and tease them along with being outright mean.
At all time Howard—the great Maestro—was of course in charge and controlled the Widdie bridge intrusion
At the end of the session I am sure most had our eyes filled with tears of joy, admiration and sadness 
A Job well done y'all

For my meanness during the past six month and the thrills I received please accept my gift below
A song by the coal miner's daughter—Loretta Lynn -- "We've Come A Long Way, Baby"

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Stan does not have a good lead. His longest suit is diamonds, but South bid diamonds, and it is almost always wrong to lead a suit the opponents have bid. So a club is a reasonable lead. However, with @CAKx, the best lead is the @CK. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Leading the king against a NT contract asks for attitude from partner. Had Stan led the @CK, Ann should signal she likes the suit by playing the @C7. Stan chose @C9, which, as will turn out, works out the same, E/W will be taking the first 3 club tricks.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As I said almost all experts would frown at my 1N rebid. But if I bid 2C, now Sandy has a problem. She can assume I have 5+ diamonds because if I only had 4 diamonds, I would have to be 3-2-4-4, and I would likely rebid 1N. But I can have as many as 17 points. So 2D would be a bit of an underbid by Sandy and 3D would probably be better, but a bit optimistic.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 3D, I take 4 diamonds and 2 hearts. I only have 4 apparent losers (2 spades and 2 clubs), but I have to be very careful. I have to make sure I ruff 2 clubs before drawing trump. I can throw 1 club on a heart. So 3D is iffy. It may or may not make. 1N was much more comfortable.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I know many of you would bid 4S with Stan's hand and most of the time, that is likely to be where you should play the contract.|MB|4s|at| However, it is a bit of a misbid. Because it is usually done with a weak hand and 5+ spades and it makes it difficult for partner for 2 reasons.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|a) if partner has a really strong hand, you may occasionally miss slam, and

b) If we bid 5C, partner will not be able to double, so Stan will have to decide on his own whether or not to double.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So my preference would be for Stan to bid 3C (limit+ raise) and then 4S. Stan should definitely NOT bid 2H. First of all that promises 5 hearts. But, more importantly, it denies 4 spades.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A good rule to follow is, whenever partner opens a major and you have 4-card support, you should show it immediately. In fact, I (along with Marty Bergen) play that if you don't show support immediately, you can't have 4-card support. So if Stan did anything other than show a spade raise, he would be denying 4-card support. Let's finish the hand, then I will discuss the proper bidding sequence.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the play is straight forward. E/W lose 3 aces and have any easy make of 4S. As to the best bidding sequence, as I said, 4S, although technically incorrect will work out almost all the time. However, a better sequence is.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now here Sandy might double suggesting she has clubs or even bid 4C based on the Law of Total Tricks (we have a 10-card fit). But let's assume she doubles.|MB|x|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ann has 11 HCP, 1 length point for 12 starting points. Her declarer add ons are 2 for the singleton and 1 for the 4-card side suit = 15 Bergen Points. Therefore, Ann should bid 4S as that is likely to be correct. Although, Stan theoretically could have exactly 10 meaning they are 1 point short of game but, Ann's singleton is in our suit which makes it particularly useful.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For those of you who are still afraid to follow the law of total tricks if sandy makes the law of total tricks bid of 4C we make 3C, losing 2 diamonds, 1S and 1H.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Down 1, even doubled, is better than their making 4S. So I strongly suggest you follow the law. It is by far the best guideline on competitive hands, much more important than HCP.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|To answer a question from the kibs, most people play that 1S-2C-3C only promises 3-card support and that is a perfectly reasonable way to play. I prefer to play it promises 4-card support. So, unless I am really stuck, I will bid a new suit rather than cue bid with only 3-card support. |
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The difference between having 8 trumps and 9 trumps is huge. With the same HCP, a 9-card fit more often than not takes 1 more trick than an 8-card fit. I really like to  know when I can count on a 9-card fit because one guideline I use is as follows:|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When I am deciding whether or not to bid a marginal game I stretch to bid game with a 9-card fit.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


AT|

And am conservative with an 8-card fit.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now the question was, should Stan bid 3S with a 3-card limit raise. The answer is absolutely not because 3C is the limit raise. A 3S bid by Stan would show 4-card support and less than a limit raise. It would be preemptive based on the Law of Total Tricks—The LAW.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NAll the boards played during his mentoring sessions are random and Howard can see the four hands. However, to his great credit he takes great pain to bid them as he does at a regular table.  Occasionally, the bidding goes not as expected and as Howard said he is "toast" which is the case in this board. |
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT||AT|
^B@2^*BMM: ^*NHowever, Howard is "family"—I am sure you know what I am talking about. I come from Detroit -:)—and I will not allow the toasting to occur at least not here in the movie. So this is how the fair and balanced MM is going to report this board. Then if you really want to know I have the real story at the end. After all this was the graduation session of two exuberant Dimweddies and one solidly reserved gentleman. I have the E/W hands blocked so you cannot peek.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most people would bid 2D without thinking about it. and that is probably correct. But I am close to a 3D bid, which would show 17-19 Bergen Starting Points. I have 14 HCP, 2 length points, and 1 point for the quality diamond suit = 17.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The problem with 3D is it takes up a lot of room and puts partner under a lot of pressure to guess what to bid. So I will bid a conservative 2D.

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) opened the BIL on  September 3, 2003 to provide the learner bridge player with a secluded place to attend lessons , mentoring sessions  and hosted practice sessions free from interruptions by the advanced bridge player.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to as you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
