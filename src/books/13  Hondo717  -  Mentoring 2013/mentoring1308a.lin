^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand it is best to bid 2@C, even with a 4-card major. Some 2/1 players, over 1@H, with a 4-card minor and 4 spades will still bid 2/1 to establish the game force, but that is not standard. However with a GF and a 5-card minor and 4 spades, it is standard to bid 2 of the minor.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The question then is if it goes, for example, 1H-2C-2S, does 2@S (which would be a reverse in SAYC) show extra values. Most people play that 2@S is simply bidding out your shape and does not show extra.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The only other point in this hand is, when you have all the tricks but one, run your tricks. It is often hard for the opponents to discard and sometimes you can stumble onto a squeeze, where one opponent cannot guard 2 suits and must give you a trick. Squeezes are actually relatively easy to do, and occur any time you have all the tricks but one, like on this hand. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3N is he correct bid. 3@S by East asks Ruth to bid 3N with a spade stopper. When 3 suits have been bid, a bid of the 4th suit below the level of 3NT asks partner to bid 3N if they have a stopper in that 4th suit. With 5 mediocre hearts and a nice spade suit, 3N rates to be the best bid almost all the time.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Liza, one important defensive principle is to "keep parity" with the dummy. That means, when you have length in dummy's long suit (in this case clubs), you need to keep the same length as dummy. By throwing a club, you just about guarantee that dummy's 4 club will win a trick. Discard one of your spades instead.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Jacquie can count 1 spade for sure (2 if need be) 3 clubs and 4 diamonds at least. The spade gives her a guaranteed 9th but there are entry issues. So I would start with diamonds as she did. Once she finishes with diamonds, she can then play a spade and see what we do. The way she did it was ok, we are likely to have to give her a trick in a major.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is an interesting competitive situation worth discussing.  Ruth is showing 6+ clubs, so I know we have a 9 card fit. So using the normal LOTT the 3 level was safe. However, with my singleton heart and favorable vulnerability, 4@C is likely to be a good bid as well. But there is a problem with bidding 4@C.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If they bid 4@H, I am not sure we are beating them. So when bidding 4 of a minor, when they have a major, particularly in IMPs, you need to decide whether you will be happy if they bid game in their major. If the answer is no, then it is  best if you not bid 4 of the minor even if the LOTT tells you it is reasonable to do so.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Actually with a 3-2 break, 3@H is a reasonable contract. 2@H by Liza shows 6-9 with 3 card heart support. With 4 hearts and less than a limit raise, Liza would bid 3@H. So by the LOTT you have an 8-card fit.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand you have a "3 over 3" decision. We are at 3 clubs, so you have to decide whether or not to bid 3@H. The one obvious criteria where it is right to bid 3 over 3 is when you have a 9-card fit (LOTT). But in this case Jacquie knows they only have an 8 card fit. |
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other time it is right to bid 3 over 3 is when you have a singleton in their suit and Jacquie does not have a singleton club. So I think pass is probably best.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, when it comes around to Liza she does have a singleton club, and therefore should bid 3@H.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So although Jacquie should probably pass, their side should end up in 3@H anyway but somewhat aggressive. After saying that, please note if hearts are 3-2 or Jacquie guesses the spades, she makes the hand. So 3@H is a good contract.|

IraCT: Howard - would you upgrade a 5 card suit to 6 with 4 honor cards?|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ira brings up an interesting point. Marty Bergen says that any suit with 4 honors can be treated as being 1 card longer than it really is. I am not sure I completely agree with that, but on close bidding decisions I do take that into account. |
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A 5 card suit, however, will still only take 5 tricks at most. Whereas AKQxxx has the potential to take 6 tricks. So I think Marty overstates the position a bit, but the basic idea is sound. A 4 honor suit is worth an upgrade.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is another way to bid it. Liza can bid 3@C, and if Jacquie bids 3D she can bid 3@S, showing 5 spades and 4 hearts. Yes that wrong sides the contract, but it does find any major suit fit they have. Wrong sideing the contract is an overrated problem. Certainly it is better if the strong hand is declarer, but it is often not crucial, and should only be give secondary consideration.|

jacquiek:  What about Puppet over that 2NT?|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With Puppet, there is a problem with 5 spades and 4 hearts because if you play puppet Stayman, then over 3@C, Jacquie will bid 3N with no 4 or 5 card major. So you will not get a chance to show your 5 spades. |
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, experts have a solution to that problem. They play that, if you play Puppet, then 3N directly shows 5 spades and 4 hearts. If you just have a 3N bid, you first bid 3@C. I definitely recommend against playing that. It is too easy to forget.|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also, some people play a version of Smolen on this hand. If it goes 2N-3C-3D-3H, rather than showing 5 hearts and 4 spades, that shows 4 hearts and 5 spades. That way the strong hand can bid 4@S with 3 spades or 3N otherwise. But for the same reason I recommend against playing 3N as showing 5 spades and 4 hearts, I am not a big fan of Smolen because partner often forgets you are playing it.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A couple of points. First, when I led a diamond for Jacquie to ruff, I was giving a "suit preference" signal. The size of the diamond tells Jacquie which non trump suit to lead back. The low diamond says lead the lower non trump suit (clubs). A high diamond would say lead the higher nontrump suit back (hearts).|
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another, should Liza bid 1N. In general, if you have a possible 1N overcall you should make it. You need a 15-18 balanced hand with a stopper in the opponents suit. Liza does have the appropriate point count but her hand has some flaws with regard to a 1N overcall. One major flaw is, she does not have a diamond stopper.|
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If the opponents open a minor suit, and you don't have a great stopper in their suit but otherwise have a good 1N overcall, it is ok to bid 1N if you have no other good bid. That is because the opening bidder does not necessarily have a long suit. That is not true with a major opener, you definitely need a stopper, because opener has 5+. But with a minor, although you should have a stopper, it is occasionally ok to bid 1N without it.|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another flaw is she is not really balanced. 5-4-2-2 is not a classic NT distribution. Again, if that were the only flaw, it would not be horrible, and you could bid 1N if that otherwise was your best bid.|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 3rd flaw is Liza has a 5-card major, and it will be hard to get that across if she overcalls 1N. Again, if the hand had no other flaws, 1N is still possible but with those 3 flaws, I think 1@H is a better bid than 1N.|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, I applaud her for wanting to overcall 1N, as too many people do not overcall 1N when they should.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) opened the BIL on  September 3, 2003 to provide the learner bridge player with a secluded place to attend lessons , mentoring sessions  and hosted practice sessions free from interruptions by the advanced bridge player.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to as you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
