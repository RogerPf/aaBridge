^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't recommend you play this convention, but let me discuss "Puppet Stayman" which many experts play over 2NT. The reason they play it is it allows you to discover if the 2NT bidder has either a 4-card major or 5-card major. In normal setting (not paying Puppet Stayman) the correct bid by Liza is 3N.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, I don't think, even were we playing it, Liza should bid it with 4-3-3-3 distribution because it is likely, even if we have an 8-card major suit fit, NT will play as well, and is a 9-trick contract rather than a 10-trick contract.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For the sake of the lesson, however, let us assume Liza wanted to find out if I had a 5-card major so we could play in a 5-3 fit. I will show you how puppet works. So Liza bid 3@C and I will walk you  through it.|mb|3C|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If we were playing Puppet Stayman: 
I bid that major—3@H or 3@S if I have a five-card major
I bid 3@D if I have 1 or 2 four-card majors 
I bid 3NT if I have neither.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Liza has the problem hand in 2/1. 2@H over 1@S promises 5. There are several solutions. One is to bid a 3-card minor as Liza did. Another is to bid a forcing NT and then jump to 4@S. Either is fine.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|MB|2H|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You don't want to do that. I have shown 5 spades and 4 diamonds. I cannot have 4 hearts, as with 5-4-4-0, I would bid 2@H. As a slam try in spades, showing 3-card support and usually at least a good 15+ dummy points. Liza has a fairly weak game force. She has 13 HCP, with 4-3-3-3 distribution with lots of quacks. The only nice feature of her hand is the quality hearts.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


ub||mb|4S|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So "fast arrival" 4@S is best. 4@S says, I have a min game force and am not interested in slam unless pard has 18+. Once you establish a game force when you jump to game ("fast arrival") that shows a weak game force.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is going to be a problem contract. I have 2 club losers and a diamond for sure. I could easily lose a spade and another diamond and be down 2. I could take the heart finesse because of the low heart lead and pitch a club if it works. And if it doesn't, hope that Ruth leads back something besides a club.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Your double was the correct bid Jacquie and once I bid 3H, you need to count your dummy points. I am under a little pressure because of the 3@D bid so I might be stretching with a good 9 or so.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But you have 13 HCP, 1 length point plus 2 for singleton (3 trumps) for 16 dummy points so you should bid 4.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, we might be in a 4-3 fit. On the other hand, I might have 5 hearts. Further, It turns out I misplayed the hand a little as well. At trick 7 if Liza returns a spade I am stuck on the board and she gets another heart trick because I can't get back to my hand to draw trump. I need to win the first spade on the board to retain the @SK as an entry to my hand.|

This short synopsis on Puppet Stayman is mainly based on an article from The Bidding Toolkit series by ACBL with Howard's supervision. The original link from ACBL listed on the article is no longer working. However, you can get it from this new |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/2z4zyw^*N|CP||AT| link.|

ht|g|AT|^B@2Puppet Stayman is a version of Stayman used in response to a 2NT opening bid. Puppet Stayman also applies when it goes 2@C-P-2@D-P-2N-P-3@C. In general, whatever you play over a 2N opener, you also play over when opener bids 2@C and then rebids 2N. Usually, 2NT opener promises a balanced hand with 20 to 21 high-card points—with or without 5-card majors. Therefore, a 5-3 major suit fit could be missed if responder has only 3-card in the suit which opener has 5-cards. Puppet Stayman is intended to remedy that problem. Let us look at  a few examples. In all examples the opponents are silent.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) opened the BIL on  September 3, 2003 to provide the learner bridge player with a secluded place to attend lessons , mentoring sessions  and hosted practice sessions free from interruptions by the advanced bridge player.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice.

Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }

CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
