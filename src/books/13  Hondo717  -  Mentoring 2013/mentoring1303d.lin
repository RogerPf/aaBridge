^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First let us comment on the double. Normally double shows close to an opening hand. Granted Ann is a passed hand so she obviously has less. With her great distribution she should want to compete. However, a more appropriate bid would be 2C or 2D, assuming partner would take that as Michaels.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to whether 2C or 2D is Michaels. I play both are Michaels, and I recommend you do too. Some experts play both as natural because 1N (or 2N) by Ann could be construed as unusual NT. Some play 2D is natural, showing 6-card suit behind the diamond bidder, but 2C is Michaels, since the clubs would be in front of the club bidder.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, I think it is easier and less confusing if you play all those as Michaels/Unusual NT. I think you should play all cue bids  as Michaels to avoid confusion.|

mb|p|SB|S|sk|s|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a bidding sequence where depending on my hand, I might want to protect against Stan having a penalty double. Whenever you open, there is an overcall, and it goes pass-pass, you need to think about that possibility. Remember if partner doubles after the overcall, that is negative.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Occasionally partner will have a penalty double which he can't make. So you as opener must protect by reopening with a double. However, that does not apply on this hand. If I were short in clubs, then it is possible. It is very unlikely Stan has a club stack because I have 3 clubs and Sandy has at least 5.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, I have no good bid and should pass. Having 3 small in the opps suit is the worse holding you can have, particularly when they do not necessarily have a fit. On the other hand, I should reopen, regardless of how strong my opener was if I were short of clubs.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A few other comments on the bidding. Stan should probably make a negative double. yes he is rather weak, but we are not vulnerable, and there is a good chance we have a major suit fit. As it turns out we have an 8-card heart fit. The way the cards are we only have 5 obvious losers -- 2 clubs, 2 diamonds and 1 spade so we might make 2H.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ann should pass 2C as she did but if she had a couple more points, she might consider 2N.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you don't play inverted raises, then 2C shows 6-9 with 4+ clubs. However, I would still bid 1N with the East hand. If your hand was unbalanced, particularly with a singleton, then 2C might be a good bid. But with flat distribution, 1N is more descriptive and probably a better contract more often than not.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|She has the right distribution for a takeout double. However, she is a little light on points to double over 1C. On the other hand, once it goes 1N-P-P, now she should double although on this hand we only have 2 7-card fits (red suits). |
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is very likely in general we have a major suit fit and letting the opps play 1N is usually not going to be a good result for you. So I personally would have doubled with Sandy's hand over 1N. Not sure, if they let us play there how well we do. But there is some possibility that Ann will bid 3C over my 2D bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Stan made a nice 4C bid but my 3H bid put him under pressure and made it hard to find 3N. They could be missing a spade game or even a club game, or perhaps 3N. If a diamond is led, because diamonds are 4-4, they make 3N. Only losing 3 diamonds and 1 heart. If a heart is led, they make 3N, taking 2H, 2S, and 5C. I don't think I double with Sandy's hand, but it certainly proved effective here.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The moral of this hand is, if you follow the law of total tricks, you more often than not get a good result. 3N was a possible bid with Stan's hand, but 4C was quite reasonable as well. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me explain a little bit about match points vs IMPs. In IMPs the size of your score matters. So the extra 500 for making a vulnerable game is very valuable, as it is worth 8 IMPs or so. Therefore, it behooves you to bid all games (esp vulnerable ones) that are close to 50%, even a little less because the reward for making far outweighs the risk if you go down.|
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you go down you probably lose around 4 or 5 IMPs. If you make you gain 8 imps. So even if you go down twice for every close game you make, you will break even. Therefore, in IMPs stretch to bid game. On the other hand, in Match Points the size of your score does not matter. It only matters if you get a better score than someone else. |
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So whether you beat someone by 10 points or 100 points or 1000 points, you only get 1 Match Point for getting a better score. Therefore, you do not want to bid a game that is less than 55% or so because if you make you gain half a MP (you get 1 point for beating whoever did not bid game vs 1/2 point for tieing them).|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If most people are not bidding game and you do and go down, you are getting 0 MP. Whereas if you settle for a partial you will get an average board. Of course if you make you get a top board. So 50-55% games are ok to bid. anything less is not ok. In Match Points, you try for average and average plus boards and try to avoid bottoms.|

^-|HT|c|va|4|CP||FP||at|There are many similarities between UNT and Michaels Cuebids.|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


AT| A ^*Bdirect cuebid^*N of one of the opponent's natural bid is a Michaels Cuebid. It requires an appropriate two-suited hand. The two suits promised usually are at least 5-5. The partner is asked to bid one of the two suits promised.|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


AT| There is no confusion whether the ^*Bdirect cuebid^*N is Michaels or not-other variants notwithstanding.|
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


AT| However, not all experts play the ^*Bdirect cuebid^*N of a Weak-Two or a Weak-Three and when the cuebid is not a ^*Bdirect cuebid^*N the same. First let me share with you what Mr. Marty Bergen says before we look at some examples.|

When the opponents have bid two suits, a cuebid of Opener's suit promises the other two suits, while a cuebid of responder's suit is natural, showing an extremely good suit and a decent hand—Howard plays both as Michaels.|

^B@2Some players only use Michaels on weak hands (<10 points) and strong hands (around 16+ points). With the intermediate two-suited hands with 11-15 points, they bid the higher-ranking suit first and hope they can rebid the other suit at their next turn. Other players simply use Michaels on hands of all point ranges, believing that it is more important to immediately show shape than to only show one suit first and then hope the auction allows them to show the other suit and their 11-15 point range. By inference "points" = HCP.|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |

Over an opening Weak-Two bid, a cuebid ^*Busually^*N promises two unspecified suits and a good hand, with at least five cards in each suit. For example:|

PG| ***** 126 ***** |


ht|h|va|6|AT|^m@23D by North is Michaels, but since it is over a pre-empt it only promises a good hand with two suits other than diamonds. Partner is expected to bid 3H with heart tolerance. Hopefully the cuebidder can clarify which two suits he holds at his next opportunity; if he has spades and clubs, for example, he can now bid 3S or 4C.|
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


HT|m|AT|^b{|ia|1cp1n!2c|at|}|

PG| ***** 130 ***** |


ht|p|AT|^m@23D is Michaels, showing hearts and spades. Note that since partner is being forced to bid now at the three-level with a major suit fit not guaranteed, the cuebidder should have a very good hand. |

You have a weak distributional hand. Your options are Pass or 2C (Michaels cuebid showing the two majors). Most experts use Michaels cuebid to show a relatively weak, distributional hand with at least five cards in each major. The better the distribution, the more aggressive they can afford to be. This would be an acceptable hand to cuebid 2C if non-vulnerable. A fit at the two level is highly likely even if North has only a doubleton heart. |mb|2c|

The distribution is perfect for a Michaels cuebid—5/5 in the major suits. However, the hand is strong (mid range) for a Michaels cuebid. You do not have to bid Michaels cuebid just because you have the fitting distribution. Make a simple overcall of 1S. You are strong enough to introduce your hearts suit even if West does raise to the two or three level.|mb|1s|

Again an expert North could have used the Law of Total Tricks and bid 3H reporting the presence of a 9-card fit. However, we are trying to prove a point and after all "Movie Maker" could be sitting North. Well Howard opined, "3H is pretty clear. I am quite sure "Movie Maker" would make that LOTT bid :)."|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The just mentioned caution about using the Michaels cuebid with an intermediate-strength hand of 12 to 16 points doesn’t apply when you have a very strong distributional hand—addressed in the next board.|

You wish to insist on playing in a major suit. The Michaels cuebid convention will get you there. You’ll find out which major North prefers, and then you can raise to game.|mb|2c|
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The Michaels cuebid is used either with a relatively weak distributional hand (mini if you will) with both majors or a very strong hand (maxi) with both majors. For hands in mid range you should use a simple overcall. Of course there are experts who play Michaels with intermediate-strength hands as well.|

After a minor opening—1C here—Michaels convention should be only used with at least five cards in each major. Bidding 2C (Michaels cuebid) can get you in a poor contract as Partner might have to bid 2S with only two or three spades. So, either Pass or make an overcall of 1H, showing your five-card suit. Most experts also insist that you should have 5/5 distribution.|

You have a two-suited hand but you cannot use the Michaels convention. A cuebid of opening one of a minor ALWAYS shows both major suits, not spades and diamonds. Make a simple overcall of 1S, the higher-ranking of the two five-card suits. It is possible that you can show your other suit next. |

Bid 2D. The immediate cuebid of the opponent’s minor suit promises both majors and in most instances a weak hand. This bid at favorable vulnerability doesn’t carry much risk since North is likely to have a fit with at least one of the major suits. It carries more risk when vulnerable. This is very similar to the earlier example where the bidding was 1C-2C|

Bid 1S. This hand does not have the proper distribution for a Michaels cuebid. Further, its strength is mid-range. Overcall in the longer suit. You may get to show the hearts later in the auction.|

st||RH||ah|9|MD|4SKJ987 H 98 D— CA 98765,,,|SV|o|MB|1H|lb|*bWhat would you bid?^^2H|MB|2H|NT|^B@2
A cuebid of 2H would show a two-suited hand with spades and an unspecified minor suit. With this weak hand by bidding 2H, you are possibly committing the partnership to the two level or the three level if partner doesn’t have a fit for spades. On the other hand Pass is another option. You don’t have to use the Michaels convention. It’s a tool you have available.|

You cannot cuebid 2D because that would show both major suits. This is an awkward hand to bid and requires some judgement. Pass, 1S, or 2C are the options. But all have flaws. Many experts may bid Pass|

^-{        Summary         }
^-|HT|d|fp||CP||at|^B@2^Z@3When the opponent on your right opens the bidding at the one level in a suit, you can use the Michaels cuebid convention to show a two-suited hand:

• A direct cuebid of opener’s minor suit shows both major suits.

• A direct cuebid of opener’s major suit shows the other major and an unspecified minor suit. 

• You need at least five cards in both suits and either a relatively weak distributional hand — less than the high-card strength for an opening bid — or a very strong distributional hand with which you intend to bid again after hearing partner’s response.|
PG| ***** 187 ***** |

BTW, the Michaels cuebid is the brainchild of the late Mike Michaels. 

A bid of a suit which was originally called by one of the opponents = cuebid. |

The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions  and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
