^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I also like Ann's 3H bid. Although she only has 15 HCP, her hand is better than that, given the auction. Her spade cards are well placed and her club suit is terrific. Her hand is worth 18 Bergen Dummy Points (15 HCP, 1 length, 1 quality suit, 1 doubleton). |
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Remember, although Ann is declarer, she counts Bergen "Dummy points." That is because the term "Dummy Points" is a slight misnomer. What Bergen really means by Dummy Points is points that the hand with shorter trump should count. |
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On most hands the hand with the longer trump is declarer. But on some hands, such as transfers and Michaels/Unusual NT, the person with the shorter trump ends up as declarer. Regardless, the person with shorter trump should count "Dummy Points" and the person with longer trump should count "Declarer" points.|

pc|H3|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, when taking a finesse it is right to lead a low card from your hand towards dummy, as Ann. However, because Ann has @hAJ1075-@HQ43, and would rather not waste an entry to get back to her hand it is slightly better technique to lead the @HQ, so she can repeat the finesse without using an entry. Not a big deal on this hand, but something to keep in mind.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That was a pretty straight forward hand. A few small comments on the play. |
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once she draws 2 rounds of trump, she should play a 2nd club to make sure they are 3-2. If it gets ruffed, no big deal, because then Ann has an extra trump left in her hand to ruff dummy's 3rd diamond.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the question as to why I bid 4H. Ann's 3H bid promises 3+ card support. Once there is an intervening bid after a transfer such as a double or overcall the NT bidder is no longer obligated to accept the transfer. Because partner will get another chance to bid. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So after the 2@S bid, the 3@H bid guarantees heart support. With no heart support, Ann must either pass, double, or bid another suit. That is an important bidding principle related to transfers.

PG| ***** 63 ***** |


AT|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NNow you will be quizzed with bidding and please note the previous bidding may not be what Howard recommends -:). Occasionally clicking "tell me" box may show several equally correct answers.
|UB|7|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


NT||lb|*bPlease make a bid for West. Keep trying till you get the correct answer.^^3D,2D,4d|mb|3d|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Stan's hand is strong enough so that he could bid 2D. But, once Sandy passes, I think tactically a preempt will work better. Also at "favorable" vulnerability (you are not vulnerable, they are) preempts are the most effective. In fact with the spade void, at this vul, 4D should be considered.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT||lb|*bPlease make a bid for North. Keep trying till you get the correct answer.^^3s|mb|3s|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ann has a problem with only 4 HCP. Should she raise? Ann's hand is worth a lot more than 4 points. She can count 1 point for the 5 clubs and 3 points for the singleton with 4-card spade support. So her hand is worth around 8 points. 3S is a bit of a stretch, but makes sense on this auction.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


NT||lb|*bPlease make a bid for East. Keep trying till you get the correct answer.^^5d|mb|p|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now as to Sandy's question. It is not up to Stan to bid 5D. It is up to Sandy. She knows they have a 10-card fit. She also knows Stan is short in spades-a void or maybe a singleton. At favorable vul, I would consider 5D with her hand. And, as it turns out, 5D is only down 1, losing 1D, 1H, and 1C-(-100 doubled is a lot better than -650).|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT|^B@2
TwstofLime:  So in this particular situation, if Stan bids 2@D, I will go to game.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Actually Sandy, if Stan bids 2D, you should want to defend.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


AT|
TwstofLime:  How come?|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because by bidding 2D Stan is not showing long diamonds. He is showing some defense. Trump length is extremely important. The longer trump you have the more you want to play the hand. That is the basis for the law of total tricks. If Stan only bids 2D, you could easily be beating 4S.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT|^B@2
anniebmisc: LOTT does still apply after interference, right?|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, LOTT applies always. Of course you can bid game even with an 8 or 9 card fit. On competitive hands, the law is your major guide.|

athni: What is the difference in bidding 2D and 3@D when you said hand is strong for 3D bid can we bid 2 level even if we have 7-carder suit?|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the question of a 2-level overcall with a 7-card suit. You can certainly do that, if you have some defensive values. I would probably always bid 3 with Stan's hand since his outside values of the @HK and @CQ are so-so for defense. But if he had the @HA or @HKQ10 of hearts, then I might only bid 2D. 2D shows a stronger hand than 3D.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT|^B@2
athni: Then 2 level with strong hand and 3 level with weak?|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

PG| ***** 94 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are sort of 2 conflicting principles here. One is, if you want to take the pessimistic view, that the hand is a misfit. Sandy is void in partner's suit, and has 4 in the overcaller's suit. So it is possible that neither side has a fit.|
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, she does have support for both minors. Therefore, if partner has a minor, a negative double will work out well on this hand. I tend to favor bidding over passing. So I think a negative double is risky, but ok. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to whether to bid 4. First it is very unusual we had 2 hands with voids tonight already. Voids only occur on < 5% of hands. Regardless if you have a void, you can stretch and bid 1 more than the LOTT says. Conversely if you have a flat hand you sometimes are better off bidding 1 less than LOTT especially at the 4 level.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Stan was guilty of what a lot of exuberant players do. And that is, when he has a good hand, he felt he had to tell me twice. I heard the 3C bid the first time. I am not sure he his even good enough to bid 3C. But certainly when I bid 3H he must pass. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Always guarantee your contract if you can. Even in match points, where overtricks do make a difference. Let's say you were playing match points. Once you get the spade lead, you should be very happy. Because on a club lead, you might be down off the top. And even if clubs are 4-4, you are only making 3N. So even playing match points, 3N rates to be at least average.|

I do not like bidding 2N or 3N OVER 1 of a minors. It takes up too much room. We could occasionally have a diamond slam as well, so I think 2D is much better than a 2N or 3N bid by me.|

With less than an opener, I can pass or correct to 3D. Since I have an opener, I must make a forcing bid, which is any suit other than 3D. In this case, 3N seemed like the best contract. Particularly since I rate to get a spade lead, and I also have a spade stopper.So 3N was clear.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is rare that you want to play 5 of a minor rather than 3N. I play that any bid by me over 2N other than 3D is a slam try in diamonds.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, if Kia had 16+ with no spade stopper he could bid 3S to ask me to bid 3N. He could also pass or bid a new suit. So some might play 3S as a slam try, showing a spade control. But absent an agreement, I would consider it asking for a spade stopper.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to as you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
