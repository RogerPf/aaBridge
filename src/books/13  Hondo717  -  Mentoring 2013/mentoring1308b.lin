^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A few things to discuss. First of all, Ruth needs to show that she has a pretty good hand. If an opp overcalls 1NT and you have a good 9 or more, you should double.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out Liza will bid 2@D which is to play (I will discuss an alternative over a penalty double) and that doesn't do that badly. But you need to show values after a 1NT overcall. In fact, if Ruth bids anything but double over 1NT, that is weak and to play.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now if it goes 1 something-1N-dbl-? lets discuss what the responder to the 1N bidder can do. The double shows an invitational hand or better, no upper limit. Absent any other agreement, all systems are off. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Suits at the 2 level are to play (e.g 2C is not Stayman, it is clubs). This is only over a double. If Ruth had passed, then systems are on. but when Ruth doubles systems are off. So on this hand, if it goes 1H-1N-dbl, Liza should bid 2@D to play.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The only other conventional bid would be for Liza to redouble. That would be what is known as an "SOS redouble." Once it goes 1H-1N-dbl, responder to the 1N bidder cannot have very many points. |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The opener has at least 12, the NT bidder has at least 15, the double has at least 9, that leaves at most 4 HCP, usually less for Liza. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So redouble over the double simply says "partner I have no long suit" and "let's try and find a fit." The NT bidder would bid their lowest 4 card suit which would normally be passed by the redoubler.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is another system over the double that I prefer, but you must agree. That system is known as "DONT Runouts." It is basically very similar in concept to DONT. If it goes 1x-1N-dbl, then the responder to 1N usually does one of 2 things if playing DONT runouts. They redouble with a single suited hand (5+ card suit in this case) which is what Liza would have done had Ruth doubled and we were playing DONT runouts. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That would force me to bid 2@C and allow Liza to show her suit. On this hand playing DONT runouts the auction would have gone 1H-1N-dbl-redbl-pass (assume that)-2@C-P-2@D. If Liza did not have a long single suit, she is almost always 4-4 or perhaps 5-4. In that case she would bid her lowest suit. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, playing DONT runouts, if it went 1H-1N-dbl-2D, Liza would be showing diamonds and either hearts and spades. I would pass with 3-card support for diamonds, otherwise I would bid 2@H which Liza would pass if she had hearts, or she would bid 2@S if she had spades. Unlike regular DONT, a DONT Runout can be made with as little as 4-4 in 2 suits because they are guaranteed to have at least one 7-card fit at worst.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So you typically would do a DONT Runout with 4-4 or perhaps 5-4 with a weak 5-card suit. On a lucky day, responder might even be 5/5.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I just thought I would mention DONT Runouts as they are interesting but I don't think you necessarily need to play them, because you rarely get doubled in 1N.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I usually play a weak NT with most of my regular partners. In that case, DONT runouts are very effective because they allow us to easily escape from 1N doubled when we need to.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The first thing that needs to occur to me is that we have game. So I must make sure I continue to make forcing bids until we get to our best game contract.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


mb|1S|mb|p|sk||NT||lb|*bPlease make a bid for North.^^2H|mb|2C|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First let me discuss possible bids by Ruth. There are 2 theories about how to bid 6-4 hands. One is you bid your 6 card suit, then your 4 card suit, then your 6 card suit. Some people call this "6-4-6." The other choice is "6-6-4"—you rebid your 6 card suit then show you 4 card suit. |
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When your suit is a major, I prefer "6-6-4" because I think it is more important to show your 6 card major than a 4 card minor. The only exception to that is when I have 6 spades and 4 hearts and it goes for example 1S-P-2C-P-?. I will rebid 2@H rather than show my 6th spade. However, in general I prefer to rebid my 6 card major.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


mb|p|sk|s|NT||lb|*bPlease make a bid for South.^^2D|mb|2D|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I have 2 choices. I could just bid 3N (2N is not forcing) but a more flexible bid would be for me to bid 2@D, 4th suit forcing. On this hand I happen to have diamonds but 2@D by me is completely artificial. All it does is says "partner, we are now in a game forcing auction" further describe your hand. |
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this auction Ruth would have several choices, depending on her hand. Her first obligation would be to show 3 card spade support. So on some hands (not this one) she would bid 2@S. My 2@D says nothing about diamonds, but if Ruth had a diamond stopper she could bid 2N. Otherwise, with 5 clubs she could rebid 3@C. |
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If she had 5+ hearts and 4 clubs she would have to bid 2@H which is one of the problems with "6-4-6". she might be forced to bid 2@H with a 5-card suit on this auction. Ruth can only bid 2N with a diamond stopper. 2@H is sort of a "default" bid saying Ruth has nothing else to bid.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It has been suggested, very reasonably, that I might bid 2N instead of 3N. That would be an example of "slow arrival" showing a stronger hand with some slam interest. I do have 15 HCP and a very nice spade suit.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT|^B@2
nome: 1H-P-1S is a 1 round force. Then South probably could bid 2@D instead of 1@S.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people who play 2/1 play you should make a 2 over 1 bid if at all possible to immediately establish a game force. In particular, if partner opens 1@H and they have 4 spades and a 4 card minor, they would bypass the spades and bid 2 of the minor. |
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if you change my hand around a little, and give me 4 spades instead of 5 with 4 diamonds some people would bypass the 4-card spade suit and bid 2@D to establish the game force. But on this hand I cannot do that because I cannot bypass a 5-card spade suit, only a 4-card spade suit. |
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So although most people, over 1@H, with 4 spades and 4 diamonds do bid 1@S. There is a style of 2/1 where 2@D is the bid. Marty Bergen for one recommends playing that way but on this hand, he would bid 1@S to show 5.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good, they got to 4@H. But Liza had enough points to bid 4@h outright. Let's count Liza's dummy points. 18 HCP + 1 quality suit point + 1 point for doubleton = 20 dummy points total. Ruth has at least 6. So Liza should bid 4@H, not 3@H. 3@H is not forcing, and Ruth could easily pass. |
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are 2 things to remember with Liza's hand.
a) "support with support" -- Liza must raise hearts with 4 card support. Any non-raise (such as 2N) denies 4 hearts
b) you know your side does not have slam.
So the only question for Liza is how many hearts to bid. 
Ruth being a passed hand, is true but not relevant here.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With a minimum opener (13-16 dummy points) she would bid 2@H. With a medium opener (17-19 dummy points) she would invite.
With 20+, Liza knows her side has at least the 26 needed for game and should bid 4@H.
These "points" assume you use Bergen hand evaluation.|

ht|b|CS|1|CP|4|HT|b|FP|3|at|^-{      Rule of 11      }
^-|CP||fp||at|
After an opening lead, usually in NT contract and if it is 4th best, Rule of 11 is a simple calculation indicating how many cards higher than the card lead, are there in the hands of Dummy, Declarer and opener's partner combined.

For example in a NT contract West leads let us say spot 7, dummy comes down and both declarer and the opener's partner (East) can make the following simple Rule of 11 calculation.

This calculation can be used by both declarer and the opening leader's partner. For declarer, he can calculate how many cards higher than the card led are held by his right hand opponent. For example, if the opening lead is the 7 and there are 3 cards higher than the 7 between dummy and declarer's hand, his right hand opponent holds exactly 1 card higher than the 7. Similarly, opening leader's partner can calculate how many cards higher than the card led are held by declarer.

You cannot use rule of 11 if the opener is leading a card in partner's suit bid or it is an honor including the ten. This information greatly can help the declarer and the defender—although admittedly most non-expert defenders do very little counting.

The explanation why such calculation works is outside the scope of this short synopsis. However, you can refer to this |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.jazclass.aust.com/bridge/rule_11/rule11.htm^*N|CP||AT| link for a nice and simple explanation. However, in the next few panels there would be ample material to make its application understood.|

^-We also have to keep the Rule of 11 in mind 
any time the opening lead appears to be 4th best.
This is never the case when an opponent leads an honor.
And obviously if an opponent leads his partner's suit,
he may not have as many as four cards, 
so the Rule of 11 won't apply if he is leading 
a suit with 2 or 3 cards.
^-|fp||cs||cp||
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


ht|n|AT|We  will have more from Mr. Bergen later. But for now let us review more what does the Rule of 11 tell us. |

%%example a
st||pn|You,,Partner,|md|1,h6,hj983,|sv|o|rh||ah|Rule 11|ah|Example A|mb|3nppp|NT|^B@2
Let us assume in this board you are playing 3N and the opening lead is @H6.|pc|h6|
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


NT|B@2
You assume that @H6 is fourth-best leads. You subtract the value of the opening lead (6 here) from 11. That determines the number of outstanding cards above the rank of the card led. |
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


NT|^B@2
11 - 6 = 5 outstanding cards above the heart 6. Dummy contains the heart @HJ 9 8 3 (three above the cards above the heart 6). Therefore, opener's partner (East) and declarer (South) have the 2 remaining cards above the @H6. South has one—@HA.|md|0ha,0,0,0|
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


NT|^B@2
East has the other. It can be either @HK, or @HQ, or @H10 or @H7. |
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
You plays the @H3 from the dummy and East plays @H10 and you win the trick with @HA.|md|0,0,0,ht|pc|h3|pc|ht|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Since East normally tries to win the trick with the lowest necessary winner (lowest equal first), now with the play of the @H10 and @HA, all the players know West has all the other outstanding cards above the heart 6—@hKQ7|md|0,hkq7,0,0|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Therefore, again everyone knows that West has the @HK Q 7. The other three hearts—@H5 4 2 could be with either West, East or South.|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That much information is great by itself but you can learn more from Rule of 11, For example the opener must have exactly 4 cards in the suit led if the opening lead—assuming it is the fourth best—is a 2.|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The reasoning behind it is simple because with five cards holding in a suit the opening lead must be higher than spot 2.|
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
One more deduction. If the opening lead is 3 and the 2 is in dummy or in declarer's had again opener has exactly 4 cards in that suit..  Opening with a 3 with the Dummy exposing a 2 in the suit would lead to the same deduction - leader held 4 cards.|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |

st||pn|You,,Partner,|md|1SA 6 4 3,s5,SJ 9 7,|sv|o|rh||ah|Rule 11|ah|Example B|mb|3nppp|NT|^B@2
Here again let us assume you are playing in 3N contract and West opens with @S5.|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


pc|s5|NT|^B@2
As declarer you subtract 5 from 11(11 - 5 = 6). Therefore, North, East and South have six spades higher than @S5. Declarer see three of them in the dummy—@SJ 9 7—and two in his hand—@SA 6. So East must have one of those. It can be either @SK, or @SQ, or @S10 or @s8. But which one?|
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It cannot be @S8 because from @SKQT5 West would have led the King. So by deduction East most likely has the @SQ or @SK. On the other hand @S10 is possible but not likely if West decided to lead low from KQ, which is the correct play, because you only lead top of a sequence in NT from a 3 card sequence or a broken 3 card sequence Further, west most likely has more that 4 spades. |
PG| ***** 140 ***** |

Defenders can also benefit from Rule of 11. For example in this board you are sitting East and defending 3N. Partner opens @s7 and declarer plays @S5 from dummy.|

NT||lb|*CWhich card should East play? Click that card on the right.^^s2^SAJ92|NT|^B@2
You assumes partner lead 4th best. 11 - 7 = 4. Therefore, Dummy, declarer and you have only four spades higher than 7.|
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You can see one in the dummy and three in your hand. So declarer cannot beat @S7 and you play low and partner continue the suit.|

NT|^B@2
West opens @D6—4th. best.|pc|d6|
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Using Rule of 11 the declarer subtracts the number 6 from 11 establishing there are 5 cards higher than the @D6 in his, the dummy, and the East hand. |
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This is a very friendly lead for declarer because he and the dummy hold four of those cards leaving only one in East hand.|hc|daqj9|
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


sk|e|NT|^B@2
East does the same calculation (11 -6 = 5) and deducts there are 5 cards higher than @D6 in the his hand, the dummy and declarer. Two are in the dummy and he has one.|hc|d8|
PG| ***** 153 ***** |

This deal is from Marty Bergen's Online Voice Lesson and the contract is 3NT. Declarer's succeed only by using Rule of 11. Let us read his narrative.|
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West leads the @C6.|pc|c6|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As declarer you see this contract is certainly not cold. You have 3 heart winners. Unfortunately, despite having the top 4 heart honors, you can't win more than 3 heart tricks.  Two spade tricks gets you up to 5 tricks. Unless West has both the @DA and @DK, you are not going to be able to establish a diamond trick. |
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


NT|^B@2
And then there are the clubs. It's nice that West has led your strongest suit and a suit in which you have 7 cards. You are going to try to do the best you can in clubs. Hopefully West has the @CK, which is suggested by his opening club lead.|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


NT|^B@2
How can we maximize our tricks in clubs. The first step is to rely on the Rule of 11. West led the @C6. Using the Rule of 11, 11 minus 6 equals 5. That says there are 5 clubs higher than the 6 in the North, East, and South hands. North has 3 clubs above the 6. South has 2 clubs above the 6. Therefore, you know for a fact that East can't beat the 6 of clubs because he has nothing above it.|
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


NT||lb|*CWhich card should you play from dummy? Click that card on the right.^^C7^cat72|NT|^B@2
Well, the opening lead guarantees that the @C7 will be a winner. Take advantage of West's unfortunate lead (for his side) and win the @C7 here and now. If you don't, you will never have a chance to win that card.|pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|c4|
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


sk||
pg| ***** 162 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you played 2nd hand low and figured “I'll think about it later”, you will win the first trick with a club honor in your hand. When you lead your other club honor, West is going to cover with the @CK. Because West has the @C9 and @C8, you are never going to win North's @C7.|
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Fortunately, sometimes the opponent's normal opening lead is not the best one for their side. You must take advantage of it. So play the @C7 at trick 1 which wins a nice cheap trick. You play low from your hand after East follows with the @C5.|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now, you are looking good. You play to your @HA at trick 2. Lead one of your club honors. It doesn't matter whether West covers or not. You still have your @CQ and @CJ and dummy's @CA and @CT. With all those club honors intact, you are going to win a total of 4 club tricks. This combines nicely with the 3 heart tricks and 2 spade tricks to give you a total of 9 tricks.|
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


NT|^B@2
North and South, both with 4-3-3-3 distribution, do not have much potential to develop long suit tricks. But when West led his 5-card suit and his partner did not have any help for him, you had the opportunity to make the hand, as long as you were alert at trick 1 and did your homework before playing a card.|
PG| ***** 166 ***** |


up|4|
pg| ***** 167 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This is the entire hand again.|
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Rule of 11 is mostly useful in NT contract because generally a good opening lead in NT is 4th. best from the longest and strongest suit. However, it could also be useful in a suit contract if it is certain the lead is 4th. best.|

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.
