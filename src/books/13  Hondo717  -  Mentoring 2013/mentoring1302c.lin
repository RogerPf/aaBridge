^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First, let me discuss "opening light in third seat." Those who like to open light in 3rd seat would open  my hand. There is a case to be made for opening light. If 2 passes, odds are better than average that 4th seat has an opener if you don't. So the theory is, you want to strike the first blow. I don't subscribe to that theory. I would rather partner always be confident I have a full opener. I personally play rule of 20 in all 4 seats.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, having said that, as you all noticed, I have an opener based on ^*BBergen's^*n Rule of 20. Unfortunately, I was distracted and did not properly evaluate my hand. So, let me explain both.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||
cs|1|cp|4|at|^-{    Standard Rule of 20    }
^-|CP||CS||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The rule of 20 says you should open the bidding if your ^*Bstandard HCP^*N + the length of your 2 longest suits is 20 or more. I have 11 HCP + 8 cards in the two longest = 19. So it is not an opener. Some people play you should not open without 2 "Quick Tricks." Quick Trick represents how many fast tricks you can take. On this hand I only have 2 quick tricks-@DA and @SA.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bergen method, however, is slightly different and in this hand adds 1 point for the spades quality suit because Bergen uses "^*Badjusted HCP^*n" instead of ^*Bstandard HCP^*N. Let me explain further.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
 ^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bergen uses "^*Badjusted HCP^*n" + the length of your 2 longest suits. The "^*Badjusted HCP^*n" is Starting Points less the points for length.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
 ^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Starting Points has the following components:
^c1) count the standard HCP; on this hand you have 11 HCP
^c2) add points for each quality suit; I have 1 quality suit-spades
^C@23) subtract for Dubious Doubleton/Singletons; I have none-A dubious short suit is a Q or J doubleton, or a singleton K, Q, or J.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


nt|^B@2
^C@2 4)add or subtract for "adjust 3"; I have none-"adjust 3" basically adds an extra point if your hand is rich in Aces and Tens and subtracts a point if it is rich in Queens and Jacks.
^C5) add 1 point for each card in each suit that has more than 4 cards in it-not for Rule of 20.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT||AT|
^B@2^*BMM: ^*NA comprehensive tutorial based on Bergen's hand evaluation is available which you can get from either BIL library at |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bilbridge.com^*N|CP||AT| or from Howard's web site at |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/^*N|CP||AT|. The Viewer link for it is |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/6eyhsw^*N|CP||AT|. Further, part 1 and part 2 of Howard's Slam Bidding Lesson Series are great sources for review. They are |cp|1|at|^*Htiny.cc/itk5rw^*N|cp||at| and |cp|1|at|^*Htiny.cc/muk5rw^*N|cp||at| respectively.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, after this long explanation, with 12 "adjusted" HCP plus 8 spades/hearts (or clubs) I could open by Rule of 20 based on Bergen's method and probably should have.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now as to the auction. Everything is fine through 2D and once you feel there is a misfit, you should pass ASAP. Therefore, Stan's pass was well considered. If he had another heart (KQJxxx) then 2H might be better, since his hand is essentially worthless in diamonds. But with only 5 hearts pass is fine. Some people might still bid 2H, which isn't awful given his nice suit, but I think pass will work out better more often.|

PG| ***** 40 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Obviously the 2N is not Unusual 2N. If I were 5/5 in the minors, I would have bid 2N over 1S. If I had a strong NT, I would have bid 1N over 1S. So my 2N can be neither of those. It is a minor suit takeout double. I do not want to let them play in 2S, as you know. |
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I cannot make a balancing double, because I do not have long enough hearts. One choice would be to bid 3C, which would be reasonable. However, because I also have diamonds I can bid 2N, which asks partner to choose his better minor.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |

stanira3: is that an OBAR bid?|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|OBAR stands for "Opponents Bid And Raise". It is Bergen's method of getting into the auction when it goes 1x-p-2x-?. His theory is that whichever person is short in the opponents suit should get into the auction. |
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, if it is your turn to bid after 2x, and you are short in suit x, you should bid if you possibly can. You can overcall a good suit or you can make a takeout double. A third alternative that Bergen recommends is to bid 2N, which is takeout for the 2 lower unbid suits (usually the minor), similar in concept to what I discussed above. |
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Absent an agreement that you are playing 2N as a Bergen OBAR 2N, that would be unusual, showing 5/5. But Bergen feels (and I agree) that you should get into the auction even with less distribution, so 2N should show 5/4 or possibly even 4/4.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Bergen also calls OBAR bids "pre-balancing" because the person who bids directly over 2x is not showing strength, just shortness in suit x and a willingness to compete. Partner of the bidder should not get too excited because, just as with normal balancing, the OBAR bidder is bidding on the combined partnership assets and is assuming even if his hand is not that strong, his partner's must be.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, as you will see shortly, since they make 3S it did not matter that I balanced. But on some hands, they can make 2 but not 3. You rarely get a good score when the opponents stop in 2 with an 8-card fit, so you should strain to balance. "If they have a fit" you have a fit.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Let us look at the math. If they have an 8 card fit, you only have 5 cards in their suit between your hand and partners. so you have 21 cards in the other 3 suits. It is barely possible that you have 3 7-card fits (3 x 7 = 21). However, odds strongly favor an 8 or even 9 card fit as on this hand. And my competitive bidding rules say it is ok to bid 3 over 2 with an 8 card fit, even though it does not meet the LOTT.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would super accept with Anna's hand. She is promising 4 spades. That is the simple part. The controversy is how many points she needs to Super-Accept. After a strong 1N opening—15/17, I have the following policy on Super-Accept which is in line with Marty Bergen's style.|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I always play Super-Accept with four-card support unless I have the ^*Bflattest 15 points NT^*N opening. Marty Bergen is a strong proponent of this method. It is based on the Law of Total Tricks as you can bid to three level with nine card fit. However, that is not the mainstream. The mainstream requires nine card fit and 16/17 points. That is something that the Partnerships should discuss and agree on.|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A Kib: According to Bergen's hand evaluation method North has 17 Dummy Points. There is a fit and because North has the shorter trumps needs to count the Dummy points though he will be declaring. Therefore, he can add 1 for quality spade suit and 1 point for doubleton diamonds for a total of 17 Dummy Points. Is my assumption correct?|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This was very hard hand for Pam to play. The best she she could do is be down 1. However, down 2 is not too bad. The important point of this hand is that Kia should have bid 3C right away. It is very possible that I would not doubled after the 3C and the let them play in 3 level which is doable. You should raise partner whenever you can. If we have an eight card fit they have an eight card fit too. Using my competitive guideline it is okay to bid 3 over 2 with an eight card fit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are a few points to this hand. First Kia evaluated his hand using Bergen's method and bid correctly and made the partner be able to bid 5 and make. The other is it is probable that 5S has is down only one. So, 5S double none vulnerable is better than letting them make 5H. However, generally it is not right to bid 5 over 5. Finally, I highly suggest that you use the Bergen's hand evaluation.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to as you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
