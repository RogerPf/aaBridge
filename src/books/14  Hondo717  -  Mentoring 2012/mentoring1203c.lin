^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^-|CP||CS||AT|
^B@2luvbridge2: Before we begin, I have a question please. If your Partner opens best minor, do you respond with your longest suit (i.e 5D) or your 4 card Major?|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is an excellent question, to which there is no standard answer but let me give you some guidelines. Some people play you always bypass diamonds if you have a 4-card major.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|

Others do the following (including me). If you have a hand strong enough to take 2 bids, you bid diamonds. If not, you bid your major. Sort of like when you have 5 clubs and 4 card major and partner opens 1D. You bid 2C if you can afford to take another bid. otherwise you bid 1 of a major. Having said all that, if you want to simplify, and play you always bid 1D over 1C with 4+ diamonds that is not a bad way to play.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's specifically discuss the auction 1D-P-2C. In SAYC it only promises 10 points. But if you have less than an opening hand, you cannot have a 4-card major. In that case you cannot afford to take a 2nd bid over 2C if partner makes a minimum rebid.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So with 10-11 and 5+ clubs and a 4-card major, you bid the major. However, with an opening hand, with 5+ clubs and a 4 card major, you can and should bid 2C. That way you then show your 4-card major at your 2nd bid. You have both established a game force and nicely described your hand. Therefore, 1D-P-2C does not deny a 4-card major.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 2 over 1 the most popular treatment is to play 2C over 1D as a game force. However, I do not agree with that treatment. The reason being, you have a real bidding problem over 1D if you have 10-11 and clubsyou do not have forcing NT available. Over 1 of a major, you have the forcing NT to take care of the 10-11 club hand. I use the SAYC treatment, even playing 2 over 1, for the auction 1D-P-2C. That is, 2C only promises 10 points.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's review at the bidding in this hand. 1D-2C is fine. Cheryl has 2 choices over 2C. 3@C is one choice. 2@S, which is a reverse, is another choice. She has a borderline reverse. but I like that bid best.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|She has 15 HCP, a quality suit, and a fit for partner. Therefore, I think a reverse is justified. Counting Bergen Dummy Points, where 17+ is enough for a reverse, she has 15 HCP, 1 length, 1 quality suit, and 2 for singleton = 19. However, I suspect Toots did not notice the reverse. If she had, then she should bee thinking about slam. The 2S reverse establishes a game force over 2C.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now Toots with 17 HCP should be thinking of slam.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


AT|
veredk: Do we count singleton before reaching a fit?|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|They have a club fit and Toots knows they have a diamond fit, since the 2S bid shows 5+ diamonds and 4 spades.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When you reverse, you show 5+ in your opening suit and 4 in your 2nd suit. If you were 4-4 you have to have a balanced hand. Therefore, you would either have opened 1N with a reverse strength hand, or you have enough to rebid 2N.|

PG| ***** 62 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4-4-4-1 hands are  problems, but you don't worry about them as they are rare. A reverse absolutely guarantees 5 cards in your opening suit. |
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A reverse is defined as a bid which forces partner to the 3 level to prefer your 1st suit. On this auction, the reverse only applies if not playing 2/1 over 1D and 2C is not a game force. Some 2 over 1 players play that once a game force is established, reverses no longer apply.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now here is where my competitive guidelines kick in about bidding 3 over 3. You only bid 3 over 3 in the following situation:
^Ca) if you have a known 9-card  fit
^Cb) if you have a singleton or void in the opponent suit.
On this hand, I strongly suspect we only have an 8-card fit, because Toots did not open  2S. On the other hand, I do have diamond shortness |
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


mb|p|SK|W|NT||mb|p|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|and, as you can see, this makes it hard for Cheryl which is one reason why you should be aggressive in competitive auctions, following my guidelines. One thing to keep in mind is suit length is paramount. HCP are not particularly relevant in competitive auctions.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a tough hand to play, and is a good illustration of why 9-card fits are so much better than 8-card fits. If I had a 4th spade, the hand would have been easy. Having said that, let's see if Cheryl has any plays.|
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|She has 3 heart losers, 1 club loser, and 1 spade loserdown 1. Her only hope is that they do not discover their heart tricks for a while. One line is to play the CJ at trick 2. If Toots leads the CJ, presumably Cheryl wins and cashes the AKQ of hearts. They also get a spade trick for down 1.|
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, lets see how E/W do. NT goes down, losing 4 spades and 1 diamond. 3D makes, 4D does not, E/W lose 2 spades, 1 diamond and 1 club. So we have what is known as a "par" result on the hand. Both sides did the best they could. My competitive guidelines really do work on most hands.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another tough hand for Toots. Ducking the first heart is great. But with second trick she should win the next heart, and play a heart knocking out the @HK. Now, she is assured making  7 tricks3 heart tricks, 2 diamond tricks 1 club trick, 1 spade  trick for sure. And if Vered does not play a black suit, Toots can actually take the D finesse and make 9 tricks. The point is, you need to plan the hand out.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is an interesting dilemma. If I suspected they had a 9 card spade fit, then, only at this vulnerability, I might bid 5H. But you should be cautious about sacrificing 5 over 4 specially in IMPs. 4S over 4H is often a good bid. But 5 over 4 is iffy unless you have a void in their suit, or at least a 10-card fit. It is very unlikely Cheryl has a spade void and we only have a 9-card fit. So I will pass.|

a) what it means, and 
b) what Toots should bid. |
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most people, or at least many people, play negative doubles through 3S. For a double, forcing partner to bid at3 level, Toots should be showing hand with at least 10 HCP and 4 spades so given that Vered should bid 3S. |
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Marty Bergen uses something known as a "thrump" double. I do not recommend you play it, but it is interesting. He plays negative doubles through 3C. Over a 3 non-club preempt a double by responder says "partner I have enough to play 3NT if you have a diamond stopper."|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So a thrump double asks for a diamond stopper. An interesting convention, but not recommended for mere mortal bridge players like us :). Most people play that as negative. What Toots needs to do is follow the "support with support" rule and bid 3 or 4 hearts. I would personally bid 4H with no wasted diamond points, a nice 10 count and a known 9+ card fit but 3H is acceptable. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Interesting LOTT hand.  Theoretically Cheryl could bid 5D with a known 11 card fit. That is down 3. Doubled that is -800 vs. the 680 for making 6 hearts. However, if you look at the "par" result, E/W should be in slam (although many pairs will not get there). So 5Dx is theoretically correct, since it is better than the -1430 E/W gets for the slam. If they bid it, the law did indeed work, as it usually does.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Basically E/W are cold for 5. Further, keep in mind the following. It is much harder to double a partial than a game. The risks of them making the partial are that the opponents doubled them into game, so opponents are reluctant to double partials.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4S by Vered is okay, just a bit risky given the vulnerability and the flat hand. It does turn out, in 4S, we only take 6 tricks so we are down 4, ugh. If they lead a diamond, then down 2 which is not as bad.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the double, I don't think Vered should double. We could easily have no spade tricks, and we have at best 1. Remember when you have long trumps, the opponents are short, so all your HCP in trumps are wasted on defense. Not to mention that Vered was lucky that West had the DK. It is just or even more likely East has it, in which case she only has 1 trick. So she should just pass and hope we beat it by 1.|

Of course you can surreptitiously get all those by watching "Khloe and Lamar TV Show!" But that is not for me. The good news is that I am in good company. Do you recall Theodore Kaczynski?

pg| ***** 218 ***** |


AT|
 
The Luddites were a social movement of 19th-century English textile artisans who protested  often by destroying mechanized looms  against the changes produced by the Industrial Revolution, which they felt were leaving them without work and changing their way of life. The movement was named after General Ned Ludd or King Ludd, a mythical figure who, like Robin Hood, was reputed to live in Sherwood Forest.|
PG| ***** 219 ***** |


AT| 

Many of the ideas that were encompassed within the Luddite Movement have been studied and evaluated in modern economics literature. The concept of "Skill Biased Technological Change" (SBTC) posits that technology contributes to the de-skilling of routine, manual tasks. |

{    Neo-Luddism - From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia    }
^-|va|4|CS||cp||AT|Neo-Luddism is a personal world view opposing any modern technology. Its name is based on the historical legacy of the British Luddites, who were active between 1811 and 1816. Neo-Luddism includes the critical examination of the effects technology has on individuals and communities. |

^-|CP||FP||at|Reform Luddism is an offshoot of neo-Luddism and represents a personal world view skeptical of modern technology and critical of its many purported benefits.|
PG| ***** 222 ***** |


AT| 

Opposition to the adoption of technology and challenges to the notion of supposed technological progress are sentiments that are echoed across history. In Gulliver's Travels (1726) Jonathan Swift ridiculed the Royal Society, the oldest scientific society in Britain, and both Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson extolled the virtue of unaltered nature.|
PG| ***** 223 ***** |


AT|

Neo-Luddism conjures pre-technological life as the best post-technological prospect, or as Robin and Webster put it, "a return to nature and what are imagined as more natural communities". Industrial Society and Its Future (1995) is a recent expression of Neo-Luddism by Theodore Kaczynski, also known as the Unabomber. The manifesto states:|
PG| ***** 224 ***** |


AT|

"The industrial revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in 'advanced' countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilled, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world." |
PG| ***** 225 ***** |


AT|

The more moderate Reform Luddism recognizes the many benefits of the evolving industrial society and embraces the inevitability of change while recognizing that change does not compel the uncritical adoption of new, seemingly useful innovations which may have unanticipated consequences. The balance of benefit and burden for acceptance of new technologies must be arrived at individually. The Reform Luddite movement resists the trend toward industrialization but does not reject and seeks to ensure that change does truly produce a net benefit overall.|
PG| ***** 226 ***** |


AT|

Both Reform Luddism and Neo-Luddism express significant doubts about the nature of benefits from uncritically embracing new information technology. Neo-Luddism holds the belief that we were better off before its advent and is the opposite of technophilia, the belief that technological innovation will remedy all ills.|
PG| ***** 227 ***** |


AT| 

Reform Luddism alternatively holds that an individual chooses to embrace or not an individual technology, that is to "Turn it on" or "Turn it off" and consequently may embrace technology to obtain a full, rich and balanced life.|

While Reform Luddism engages change in a moderated way Neo-Luddism often expresses itself in stark predictions about the effect of new technologies. John Philip Sousa for example regarded the introduction of the phonograph with suspicion,  predicting:|

CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play double dummy, you see all four handsits great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to take it. Now, you may lead the next cardfrom the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return back. |
