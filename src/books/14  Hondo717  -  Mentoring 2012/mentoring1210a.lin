^B@2^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|This presentation is based on unused material from May 2009 which I had it in my "Rainy days" file. Though three has been no rainy day in Southern California I have decided to clean up that file. Currently, the participants are among the best players in BBO. I have heard their meteoric climb has a lot to do with all the mentoring session movies. But I am not fully convinced :).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Again this hand illustrates that it is important on both offense and defense to count out the suits. Once I show up with one heart, Noi should realize Pam started with two and file that away in case it is important. And Pam should realize, because I opened 2D, Noi started with 2 diamonds. Sometimes this information makes no difference, but often it does, and if you get in the habit of automatically filing these things in your head, it really helps.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other thing I want to comment on is Pam's ruffing of a diamond right away--at trick 2. In this case, her plan is to set up dummy. There really is no reason to ruff diamonds, because the long trumps are in dummy. So, assuming hearts break, she can count six hearts, 1 spade, 1 diamond, and 1 club for sure.|

PG| ***** 26 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You can just play ace and another heart to get to board, no reason to ruff a diamond. You unnecessarily used up a trump that way. To get back to the plan.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If hearts break, she needs one extra trick in the black suits. If Noi, has the Q of clubs, that is one possibility. However, once hearts don't break, she needs two extra tricks--needs an extra spade. And the easiest thing to do is play me for the K of spades. So lead a low spade towards the Q. But when that doesn't work, then you have to hope Noi also has the J of spades, so lead low towards your A10, Therefore, playing the 10 of spades right away was incorrect, because it took away one of your options. The idea is to keep as many options open as possible.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This was not a makeable contract, so we need to talk about the bidding. Everything through 4C was fine. However, Pam, you have a pretty minimum overcall, so there is no reason for you to bid 4D. You have no extra features, such as a singleton club, or extra points, or a really good diamond suit. So pass is pretty clear. And Betty, the same thing applies to you. You showed your limit raise. Therefore Pam and Betty should have passed. Betty has shown a limit diamond raise, and that's what she has. |
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Additionally, she has 4 spades, which is good on defense. Although I think it is important to be aggressive, it is also important to know when to pass. Basically, if you have shown your hand, and have no additional important feature, you can pass. In this case, both Pam and Betty have pretty much what they said they have, with nothing extra, so both should pass.|

UP|52|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|OK, mostly I want to discuss the bidding, but let me make a brief comment about how best to play the heart suit. Basically, the easiest way to play the suit is to hope Betty has the K of hearts. if that is true, you lose one heart. So, the best play is low to the A and low back towards the Q. In this case there happens to be another unlikely distribution that means you only lose one heart trick as well. Because, Betty has J10 doubleton, your 9 sets up. an added bonus :) The reason to play the heart suit as I suggested is that it is your best hope for only one heart loser if Betty has the King.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, to the bidding. Betty should raise clubs right away. Given the vulnerability, I think she should bid 3@C. In general, although partner is only promising 3 clubs, 80% of the time, they will have 4 or more. So, Betty can bid 3C on the first round, confident that most of the time she will be in a 9 card fit.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, it is not an inverted minor.  Inverted Minors is off after intervention. 2C is still a weak bid over the double. If you play Jordan 2N, 2N would show a limit raise with 4+ clubs, so no reason to play 2C as showing a strong hand. If you don't play Jordan, a redouble is used to show your points. so, 2C over a double is always less than 10 points.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Interesting hand. It has been suggested I double and correct, and that is certainly reasonable with my hand. The reason I did not was more tactical than anything else. I was afraid there would be a diamond raise, and that means I would have to bid my suit at the 3 level if I doubled first. So I chose to show my spades rather than my points.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |

Dianne0516: Howard, on a double and correct, is it forcing to game?|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, a double and correct is not forcing to game, but partner should strain to bid if at all possible. Here, Pam's hand is too weak to bid 4, even with 3 spades. But if she had as little as an ace with 3 or 4 spades, she should consider bidding 4. I am promising usually a six card suit, and at least 16 good points.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The first is, I don't like opening 2C when my suit is diamonds, because it wrong sides the contract, and we get too high too fast.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Darlene I gave you an undo so you can change your opening lead. Carefully select your opening lead. Even though I raised clubs, you have a better lead than your original clubs lead. in general avoid leading unprotected aces. Here, if you lead clubs, the ace is right. But clubs are not right. You cannot lead spade because Jana bid spades. So by process of elimination you should lead diamonds. Here top of the honor sequence is the correct lead.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me explain some opening lead theory here. First of all, generally it is not a good idea to lead unprotected aces. With Darlene's holding it is particularly dangerous to lead club Ace. Suppose for example club Ace as an opening lead and if I have the Q and Jana has the K, which is quite possible. In that case I need to lead clubs through Jana's king. Another thing to avoid is leading the opponents suits. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Sometimes a trump lead is ok, but avoid leading their suit if it is not trumps. In this case, by the process of elimination the lead is diamonds. With J109, Darlene should feel very comfortable leading the J, top of an honor sequence. Also, because of that lead, I know Jana has the Q of diamonds.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|OK, we talked about the important point on this hand, which was the opening lead. The other issue was Darlene should play low quickly on the heart trick. Remember, 2nd hand low. it is rarely wrong.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case, it defeated the contract, because Jana correctly finessed the 10, but had Darlene played the ace, she might have gotten the suit right. The 10 is the correct play Jana. It picks up AQx in Darlene's hand. it is only wrong on this particular distribution, which is lower percentage, and you have no way of knowing that.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us discuss opening leads again. Some general guidelines:|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Don't lead any suits the opponents have bid;|
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Don't lead unprotected aces;|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If partner bids a suit, unless you have an unprotected ace in it or are void, lead that suit;|
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Honor sequences are the best leads. so, for example on the hand before this one, J from J109 tends to be a good lead;|
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you only have small cards, no honors, you need to decide whether you lead count or attitude. The modern tendency is to lead attitude, so if Darlene decides to lead spades, she should lead a high spade to show no honors, the 8 in this case. However, some people still play count, in which case the 2 would be right. But, I recommend attitude. Generally speaking doubleton leads are not a good idea. Only lead them if there is no other good lead.|

AT|
^-Veal Osso Bucco with Gremolata
by Roberta, BBO nickname "robzim"
^-|at|^b6 (8 ounce) veal shanks, trimmed
Salt and pepper to taste    
¼ cup of flour
1 tbs. butter divided
1 clove garlic (minced)
1 cup finely chopped yellow onion (1 medium)
½ cup finely chopped carrot 
½ cup finely chopped celery
2 bacon slices (I omitted these – I don’t eat pork)
1 cup dry white wine
1 cup fat-free, reduced sodium beef broth
1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes (drained)
1 cup chopped parsley
1 teaspoon grated lemon rind

Sprinkle veal with salt and pepper and dredge in flour. Melt 1 ½ tsps. Butter in large dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add 3 veal shanks and cook for 8 minutes – browning on all sides. Remove to a plate and repeat procedure for the other 3 shanks.

Add all vegetables (and bacon) to the pan; sauté for 5 minutes. Add wine and cook another 5 minutes, reducing the liquid. Add broth and tomatoes. Return the veal to the pan and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat and simmer for 2 hours (or until the veal is tender). Check on it to make sure it isn’t losing it’s liquid – if so lower the heat. Combine parsley and lemon rind and add to osso bucco.  Cook another 10 minutes.

NOTES:  I always make things like this a day ahead of time so that the flavors can sink in.  

^tEnjoy.  Roberta  |
