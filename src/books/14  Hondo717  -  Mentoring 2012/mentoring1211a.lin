These hands are very difficult to get right, but my 4H bid made it particularly difficult. If I opened 1H then Bonnie probably bids a Michaels bid of 2H-showing  5/5 in spades and an undetermined minor. That will allow them to find their diamond fit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us discuss Spencer's splinter bid. When partner opens 1 of a major, a double jump in a suit is called a splinter. It shows an opening hand (13-16 dummy points) with 4 trump and a singleton (usually) or a void (occasionally) in the bid suit.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over 1@S -- 4@C, 4@D, and 4H are splinter bids.
Over 1@H - 3@S, 4@C, and 4@D are splinter bids. They are very descriptive.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


AT| Let us look at when should opener consider slam?|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The idea is that you need a good "fit" and that means in this case it depends on what Bonnie has in hearts. She does not want wasted HCP in hearts. The ace is not wasted, because it takes care of the singleton. But the @HK @HQ and @HJ are all wasted, because they do not fit well with partner. The best holding to have over a splinter is either 3 or 4 small, or 3 or 4 to the ace. The @HQ in Bonnie's hand was wasted, plus she had a minimum opener, so she clearly did not want to go on.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, let's move a couple of cards around. Change the HA to the CA, and the @HQ to the @DK. In that case Bonnie only has 1 more point, 12 HCP, but slam is cold because of the excellent heart holding, with no wasted HCP. Please remember, if pard spinsters, you must discount all high cards in the splinter suit other than the ace. And you also must discount shortness (doubleton or singleton). You want small cards in the splinter suit so you can generate tricks by ruffing which is why I said 3 or 4 small is ideal.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Splinters are nice bids, and you should make them when appropriate. However, they do have the one disadvantage that they take up a lot of bidding space. So you should not splinter with a strong hand that might have slam any way. A good rule, recommended by Bergen, is you should have 13-16 dummy points to splinter, no more. That way, partner knows your hand is limited, and can judge accordingly. |
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, Spencer was border line in terms of almost being too strong. He has 14 HCP, 1 length point, and 3 for the singleton, which gives him 18. So if he chose 2N, that would be fine. However, what then happens is, over 2N, Bonnie bids 4S. That shows 12-14 HCP and no singletons or voids. Then Spencer is left to wonder if the singleton heart is enough to make slam. Not bidding a splinter is a two-edged sword.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good bid. Let me explain why Bonnie should not even consider 2S. Her partner did not make a negative double, so it is unlikely to have spades or if he has spades, he has a real bad hand. So 3D is clearly much better than 2S. Remember, you learn a lot by what is NOT bid, as well as what is bid.|

sk|n|NT||lb|*bWhat should North bid?^^3h|mb|3H|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Should Joan bid 3H? For those who remember my "3 over 3" competitive guidelines the answer is yes she should. Your hand must meet one of the two conditions in order to bid 3 over 3. You either have to have a 9-card fit (e.g. Joan needs 6 hearts). That follows the Law of Total Tricks or, as on this hand, you need a singleton in the opponents' suit. So nice 3H bid by Joan. Pease note that I "opponent's suit" which is critical.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bonnie needs to notice two things on defense. The more important principle is that you should try and keep "parity" with dummy's long suits. On this hand, since dummy has 4 spades, Bonnie should also keep 4 spades. Otherwise, as happened on this hand, the low spade on dummy might set up.|

^-|CP||FP||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMart Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|I’ve found these doubles to be essential when you are trying to get to 3NT after an opponent’s preempt. Although Thrump Doubles are not yet well-known, their intent is very similar to the popular convention Western Cue-bids.|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


AT|

The phrase "Thrump Doubles" was coined by World Champion Eric Rodwell by deleting the six middle letters in the phrase, THRee notrUMP. Eric used this term to define certain doubles in Precision. He found Thrump Doubles to be especially useful when a player was hoping to play in 3NT, but lacked a stopper in the suit that an opponent had bid.|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


AT|

I agree with Eric; that on certain auctions, a double is needed to ask partner to bid 3NT with a stopper in the opponent’s suit. The two auctions where I feel Thrump Doubles are most necessary are:|
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


AT|

1. Partner opens one of a suit; an opponent jumps to 3D, 3H, or 3S; and responder doubles.  (Normal Negative Doubles are used after 3C.)

2. The auction begins with an opponent’s 3-level preempt, and you (or your partner) doubles.|
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


AT|

Why try so hard to get to 3NT after their preempt?|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


AT|

In a suit contract, ruffs or bad trump splits are often fatal. Meanwhile, because the preemptor probably has no entry, 3NT rates to play like a dream. In fact, not only should you prefer 3NT rather than 5C or 5D, but you should also prefer 3NT to game in a major suit!|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


AT|

Thrump Doubles say nothing about unbid suits. The doubler may have great length/strength in a minor, but he lacks a stopper in the opponent’s suit. On most hands, opener has a stopper and will bid 3NT. With no stopper, he’ll do the best he can. Unless your opponents stop preempting, or you like playing in 5C and 5D, you don’t want to play bridge without Thrump Doubles!|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
