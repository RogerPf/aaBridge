mn|      Howard's Weekly Teaching Sessions     |
qx|P1|HT|d|CS||FP||CP||AT|^b@2^z@3^*BHoward Schutzman^*N|FP||AT|, BBO nickname "hondo717", our teacher and mentor, currently holds free weekly teaching sessions in the IAC on Thursdays at 2200 New York Time. Those lessons are voice lesson and I only can convert them into BBO movie after spending a great deal of time transcribing his voice recording. 

However, they are so good that I cannot just overlook them. What you will see next is my novel way of bringing you the prime meat of the session and put aside the fat and the skin while saving some precious time. I hope someone out there send me a note. I even accept a note saying, "You done awful. Find another hobby."

This presentation covers the sessions held on|CP|1|AT| May 31, 2012|CP||AT|. The main topic covered in each board is outlined in the table of contents. And you know how it works.|ht|m|at|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would bid as Roberta did. I even cannot fault her if she had bid 4H. There are many experts who do not agree with me on two main issues concerning this hand. One is having four-card major which I do not agree with and Marty Bergen has enforced that belief. The second being the hand is stronger when you have a void. There is no question that hands with void are stronger but it all evens out if you follow the Law of Total Tricks.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Anything could be right here, including pass and 4D. As it turns out, if it goes 3H-P-P-P, EW is probably down 1. But I decided to compete to 5D for the following reasons:
a) I have a wonderful suit
b) I have little defense
c) I have shortness in hearts
d) I have great distribution. 7-4-1-1 means you are short in 2 suits, and you get very few 7-4 hands.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|
All those factors favor bidding over passing. Further, there are 2 reasons why I chose 5D rather than 4D. The reward for making 5D mitigates the risk somewhat. And if it goes 3H-4D-4H-P-P-?, I will more likely than not bid 5D anyway.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, on the actual hand, both pass and 4D work out better (assuming partner passes). Which is why you should preempt, because you make it harder for the opponents to make the right bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is no reason to duck the spade Ace here. West has at least two spade tricks. I can understand the first time the ducking was to prevent the access to spades in the dummy.  But now if the Ace is not played that trick could be lost. Don't duck it if you cannot find a good reason to duck the Ace.|

up||nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I hear all of you telling me you have painted, "Second hand low" on your ceilings. But the reason for "the second hand low" is you want to capture an honor with an honor with your honor. For example if your right hand opponent leads a King and you have the Ace in the second hand take it. It is almost as Yogi Berra said, "When you come to a fork in the road....Take it." |

NT||lb|*CWhich card should West lead from diamonds suit?^^D9^S45H2679AC67JD679|
pc|D6|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had Stan |cp|8|at|not|cp||at| supported the suit diamond six would be the correct lead because he wanted to give count in the suit. However, since Stan supported the diamond the @D9 is the correct lead. In this case it does not matter but it could be nice for partner to know the partner does not have or does have an honor. So if you are leading partner's suit and if have |cp|8|at|not|cp||at| supported it you lead count—low from three-card.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


AT| But if you have supported the partner's suit you lead attitude. In that case you cannot have a doubleton, therefore, you can lead top of nothing or low from an honor.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|I have been at this fork on the road before and I took it! |cp|1|at|Thank you Yogi—see more on Yogi Berra in the Movie Makre's Corner.|cp||at| But I heard and read so much on it that I cannot even remember what to do at the live table. The correct answer is 3S or the "Super-accept"—jump to 3 with 4-card support, regardless of points, based on LOTT. Later there would be a Tutorial on Super-Accepts based on information given to me by Marty Bergen, Howard, and Andrew Gumperz, BBO nickname "agumperz" which should be a good read. For now let us continue with the current board.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|During the session a good question came which I like to suspend the regular bidding and bring you that question.|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


MB|4N|NT||cp|1|AT|
^B@2^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|The question was: Is the 4N now a Blackwood (either regular or Key Card) or a quantitative. Howard's answer is next.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this bidding cycle the 3S establishes the trump and the 4N is definitely a Blackwood (either regular or Key Card). The quantitate 4N occur rarely and is in direct response to either 1N, 2N openings or direct response after a 1N or 2N rebid by the opener. For example 4N in both the following 1C-P-1H-P-1N-P-4N or in 1C-P-1H-P-2N-P-4N is quantitative. You can lessen the confusion if you follow such a simple policy.|

PG| ***** 97 ***** |


AT|

Lawrence Peter "Yogi" Berra born May 12, 1925 is a former American Major League Baseball catcher, outfielder, and manager. Berra is arguably considered as one of the greatest catchers in baseball history and probably is one of the most recognizable name associated with baseball. 

His malapropism—It ain't over till it's over—has made him a cultural icon. His "yogi-isms" are quoted by everyone from young children to Presidents of the United States. It is not strange that as a reformed Luddite I have a special place for him in my heart. Please enjoy a few of his "yogi-isms" next.

Always go to other people's funerals, otherwise they won't come to yours.

Baseball is ninety percent mental and the other half is physical.

Congratulations. I knew the record would stand until it was broken.

Even Napoleon had his Watergate.

Half the lies they tell about me aren't true.

How can you think and hit at the same time?

I always thought that record would stand until it was broken.

I just want to thank everyone who made this day necessary.

I never blame myself when I'm not hitting. I just blame the bat and if it keeps up, I change bats. After all, if I know it isn't my fault that I'm not hitting, how can I get mad at myself?

I never said most of the things I said.

I think Little League is wonderful. It keeps the kids out of the house.

I wish I had an answer to that because I'm tired of answering that question.

If people don't want to come out to the ball park, nobody's gonna stop 'em.

If you ask me anything I don't know, I'm not going to answer.

{      Beginner Intermediate Lounge, Our Home      }
^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
