^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Are new suit after overcalls forcing? |
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


AT| There are couple points you should know about bidding when your partner has overcalled. |
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding over an overcall is different than bidding after an opening bid. Because the overcaller's lower level is lower and the higher level is also lower. The upper limit is about 16 and the lower level is 8 to 9 points. With a strong hand the overcaller should double and correct. So an overcall range is 8-16 points-give or take one.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other points is whether new suits after overcalls are forcing or not. Some experts play they are forcing and some don't and they play the only forcing bid is a cuebid. I like to play they are forcing and use cuebid as a limit raise or better of the bid suit. But you need to decide.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, because new suits after overcalls are forcing you need more than 9 points. Some make the bid with 4-card suit and some with 5-card suit. Here North has all the requirements to bid 1S over my 1D overcall. However, if you remove the @CK-though the 3 points is dubious-North should pass the 1D overcall.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I do not like to bid 1N over 1C opening because it often wrong sides the contract. Here I prefer 1D bid by North instead of 1N. North has 9 HCP and has two choices of bids-1D or 1N.|
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Walsh treatment says when partner opens 1C and you have 4-card major you can and you should bypass your diamond suit and bid your major. Most people play that and I play a modified version of Walsh which I explain later.|
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


NT|^B@2
nome: But I thought with a minimum hand after 1 minor (1C here) opening responder's priorities are 1 major followed by 1N if no 4-card major, and then 1D.|
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is not completely correct. After 1C opening with 6-9/bad 10 you can and you should bid your 4-card major. However, Walsh does not say that you should not bid 1D with no 4-card major. Here North does not have 4-card hearts or 4-card spades and can bid 1D. There, even if you play Walsh 1D is a better bid than 1N.|
PG| ***** 96 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The priorities for responders are to bid the 4-card major if they have one, to bid 1D if they don't have 4-card major and only to bid 1N if they do not have any other bid. Of course we are talking when the responder has a minimum hand.|
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I understand that some experts bypass their diamonds when they have 4-card major regardless of the strength of their diamond holding. I don't play it that way. I even bid 1D over really weak 4-card major when I have good quality diamond suit.|
PG| ***** 98 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, you should not bypass your diamonds when you can take a second bid.|
PG| ***** 99 ***** |


cp|1|AT|
^B@2^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|Here Howard sensed that nome still is confused and asked him to send an email with his further questions.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West should keep parity with the dummy so the @D10 would not setup. Here probably West can discard a heart or a spade. You give one sure trick to the declarer by discarding from diamonds suit. I probably would discard either a spade or a heart. After the play I would like to explain how declarer could maximize the number of diamond tricks in this hand. Here as you can see-after the diamond discard-declarer is going to make 4 diamond tricks no mater how she plays the suit. |

AT| In how to properly play the diamonds in this board I need to mention several points.  |
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A. Here when you run the clubs, it is likely one of the defenders will discard a diamond, so you should guard against the other defender having 4 diamonds.|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|B. Unlike the previous hand with the spade play, there are 2 equally good ways to play the diamond suit, depending on who you think is more likely to have started with 4 diamonds. That is because, unlike the previous spade hand, on this hand declarer has both the @D10 and @D9. |
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, if you decide to guard against West having 4 diamonds, you cash the @DA then @DK and finesse West for the @DJ if necessary. If you decide to guard against East having 4 diamonds, you play the @DA, a diamond to the @DQ and finesse against East for the @DJ if necessary. |
PG| ***** 120 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let us go back to trick 5 and have West discard differently so I can show you how to play the diamonds properly to maximize the tricks won even with 4-1 distribution-West having 4 diamonds.|

Of course Howard sums up everything in his usual "comprehensive but to the point" style. First is the material from Pattaya bridge club. When you access the site please choose "Section 1" then scroll down to word WALSH in blue color. Let us look at the Pattaya bridge club material first. I condensed the material somewhat to fit this review but most important parts are verbatim.|

Walsh is a treatment in response to partner's 1C opening in a standard American or 2/1 type system. The treatment works equally well if you play better minor or short club. When partner opens 1C the standard responses are up-the-line and one bids a 4-card diamonds suit in preference to a 4-card hearts or spades suit. Playing Walsh you ignore a 4 or 5-card diamonds suit and respond in the 4-card major with a weak hand. Consider the following examples.|

1NT. This is the major point of the Walsh system – assuming partner is weakish, you get the 1NT contract played by the right hand and give no information away to the opposition about your major suit holdings. If partner has a 4-card major then he will reverse into it and the fit is not lost.

^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|We will take a look at responding to 1C from the view point of two distinct groups.|
PG| ***** 209 ***** |


AT|

The first group’s view can be labeled as the "Standard" approach. They bid suits up the line and would always respond with a five-card diamond suit rather than a four-card major.|
PG| ***** 210 ***** |


AT|

The second group includes those who agree with the Walsh and Kaplan-Sheinwold approaches. This group strains to respond in a major if possible, particularly on poor hands. For the moment we will refer to them as "Walsh."|
PG| ***** 211 ***** |


AT|

In comparing the two approaches, you will notice that the key for both is the first response and the theory behind the approved action. "Walsh" believes that responder should always show a four-card major immediately. The only exceptions are hands with very long diamond suits or very good hands that have slam potential. Using the Walsh approach, let's try some hands in response to partner's opening bid of 1C.|

1D . This is not psych, but merely the lesser of evils. It would be wrong to bid 1NT, since we don't wish to be declarer—and most partnerships require more than 6 HCP for a 1NT response to 1C.

^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|West Coast players refer to this as the "Walsh Diamond," named after Dick Walsh, West Coast expert of the 60's, who was one of the first successful practitioners of the style. Of course, Kaplan-Sheinwold adherents use this treatment in responding to 1C, although in conjunction with weak notrumps.|
PG| ***** 233 ***** |


AT|

When does a "Walsh" player respond 1D to 1C? As our examples show, about the only hand types are 
^c@2(a) a hand with no major, usually with four or more diamonds, and 
^C@2(b) a full opening bid or better usually with five + diamonds as well as one or two four-card majors. The inferences that opener can draw from this can be very helpful.|
PG| ***** 234 ***** |


AT|

Opener rebidding style of each group will be governed by their respective styles. |
PG| ***** 235 ***** |


AT|

After 1C -1D, Standard bidders must continue the up-the-line search for a major-suit fit. Responder could easily have a major as well as diamonds, so if opener doesn’t show the major, a fit may be lost and responder may have a hand that is too weak for a second bid.|

Walsh players are involved in a very different situation. A 1D responder has denied holding a four-card major unless preparing to reverse on a strong hand. Therefore, opener does not have to show a major if one is held. With a balanced hand, opener should take advantage of the methods used to show the minimum balanced hand by rebidding 1 NT. These players can't miss a major-suit fit since responder will now reverse into a major if one is held.|

If partner is about to bid spades now, holding a good hand, you will of course support spades. If none of this develops, you might get a favorable spade lead against your notrump contract.

Let's move on to the matter of responder’s rebids, where you will see that the early auction greatly affects the responder's thinking in planning the rebid. In each example select your bid first using Standard approach and Walsh approach next.|

Bid either 1NT or 2C. 2@C is probably the right bid in Standard American. You are not anxious to play notrump from your side-usually you should have the unbid suit stopped.|

Of course if partner has the hand shown above|MD|0,0,SKQJ9 HKQJ D865 CJ52,0|at| or some similar hand, 2C should lead to a ridiculous contract with a cozy 1NT available.

Bid 2C. Partner definitely has an unbalanced hand, and on this auction promises five or more clubs! Think about it. In order for partner to have an unbalanced hand, there must be a singleton, a void, or two doubletons.|
PG| ***** 271 ***** |


nt|^B@2
Therefore, partners likely distributions are 4-2-2-5, 4-3-1-5, 4-1-3-5, 4-0-4-5, 4-?—?-6, 4-4-1-4, or 4-1-4-4. But with 4-4-1-4 he would rebid 1H, and with 4-1-4-4 he would usually open diamonds.|

If he holds something like|MD|0,0,SKQ92 H9 D9862 CAKJT,0|AT| he will make sure we play in diamonds himself.

Bid 1NT or 2C or Pass. 1NT is not very attractive with no stopper in either red suit, but partner will expect four spades for the raise of a secondary suit. Many experts would go ahead and raise to two spades anyway, because of the location of the high cards, hoping that the 4-3 would be manageable. |
PG| ***** 275 ***** |

Pass will probably result in your playing in the correct strain, but even |MD|0,0,SAJ64 HT84 DA CAQJ64,0|at| the cards shown above in partner's hand is enough for a cold game.

cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Walsh can be very confusing. If you just want to play you bid suits "up the line" (e.g. you bid 1D with 4+ diamonds even with a 4-card major) that is fine and probably easiest to play.|
PG| ***** 284 ***** |

My teaching is not that different than either Pattaya or Bergen. Basically they are saying the following regarding Walsh:|
PG| ***** 285 ***** |


HT|j|AT|^B@2a) Almost always bypass diamonds if you have a 4-card major.|
pg| ***** 286 ***** |


HT|j|AT|^B@2a) Almost always bypass diamonds if you have a 4-card major.|
HT|l|AT|^B@2b) The only time you bid 1D with a 4-card major is when you have a hand strong enough to take a second bid after opener's rebid (e.g an opening hand or very close).|
pg| ***** 287 ***** |


HT|j|AT|^B@2a) Almost always bypass diamonds if you have a 4-card major.|
HT|l|AT|^B@2b) The only time you bid 1D with a 4-card major is when you have a hand strong enough to take a second bid after opener's rebid (e.g an opening hand or very close).|

HT|q|AT|^B@2d) Opener, with a balanced hand, can and should rebid 1N after a 1D response, even with a 4-card major, because the 1D response almost always denies a 4-card major. The only time the 1D bidder has a 4-card major is if he is strong enough to make a 2nd bid, in which case, even though opener bypassed bidding their 4-card major, the 1D responder can now introduce his 4-card major over the 1NT rebid since he is strong enough for a 2nd bid.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|nome carefully studied this review of Walsh and while leaving our office said, "Playing bridge, particularly face to face, is more complicated, more dangerous and bloody, more damaging, less fun, and more foolish than wrestling a grizzly bear in the outskirt of Nome, Alaska."

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
