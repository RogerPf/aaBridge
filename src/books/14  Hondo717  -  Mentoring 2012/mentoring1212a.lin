^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most people these days bypass diamonds to bid a 4-card major. And if you want to always do that, that is fine. But I play a more nuanced version. With a weak hand, I will bypass diamonds. With a hand worth 2 bids (e.g. 10+) I will bid 1D. I will also bid 1D if I have really good diamonds. Further, It is fine if you always bid 1D over 1C with 4 diamonds and a 4-card major. However, just agree with partner.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2N has a very specific meaning. It shows a balanced hand too good to open 1N but not good enough to open 2N (e.g. 18-19 HCP). I don't think the hand qualifies :) a) it is not balanced and b) the hand is more than a minimum because of great clubs. I think 3C is probably best. Bonnie actually has a 2.75 club bid :).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nice double by Joan. Bonnie should love her 6-5 hand in general. But once I bid hearts, she needs to be careful of a misfit hand. Her 2D bid was good and she should love her spade void when we bid spades.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had I not bid hearts, she should take another bid. But because I did open 1H, and because we are getting a bad spade break, pass is better than 4D. However, despite the result, 4D was not completely unreasonable. If Spencer had a couple of diamonds, it could work out well.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Some comments on the bidding. First, since West has game forcing values, she should not bid 2S. If she did not have a 4-card major, then 3N by West would be a good bid. However, since West has 4 hearts, she should first bid Stayman, and bid 4H if partner has hearts, and 3NT otherwise.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some experts might suggest the following auction: 1N-P-2C-P-2S-P-3C. 3C is definitely forcing and would show 5+ clubs and 4 hearts. Some people play that simply suggests that 5C might be a better contract than 3N. However, I have found that, over the long run, there are very few hands, once partner opens 1N, where 5 of a minor makes and 3N goes down. So I play that 3C is a slam try in clubs, and therefore would bid 3N over 2S rather than 3C. |
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My feeling is, if you worry too much about playing 5 of a minor rather than 3N, you will sometimes get to contracts that go down in 5 of a minor and make 3N, and you will rarely get to contracts where 5 of a minor makes and 3N does not. Not to mention that, if playing match points, 3N scores better than 5 of a minor.|

nome: When do you suggest a transfer to minor?|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Assuming you play the simple version of minor suit transfers (e.g. 2S forces 3C, which responder either passes or bids 3D). It is very rare to do a transfer. In fact, you could just throw that convention out with little consequence on your bridge.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|But if you play it, you should only do it with a weak hand, 6+ card suit, and unbalanced distribution (singleton or void). Remember you are contracting for 2 more tricks (9 vs. 7). 9 tricks a lot harder to take than 7. |

^-|CP||FP||at|^B@2^Z@3Bridge information stays with me as long as writing on the sand at the beach. It takes only one soft wave to wash everything away. However, as I get older I become more persistent and keep writing on the sand--reviewing the material over and over. This week I have ^*I4-Suit Jacoby Transfers - Transfer to Minors^*N by Howard.|

{ 4-Suit Jacoby Transfers - Transfer to Minors }

^-|cp||AT|^B@2^Y@3
One variant of Jacoby that I use is 4-suit Jacoby. A 2S bid by responder is a transfer to clubs, and a 2NT bid is a transfer to diamonds (to make a 2NT invitational bid, we bid Stayman followed by 2NT (e.g., 1NT-2C-2S-2NT does not necessarily promise hearts). Since there are two bids between the transfer bid and the transfer suit, opener now has two choices. |
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


AT|

With good support (having 4 small, one of the top 3 honors-even with a doubleton), opener "accepts" the transfer by not bidding the suit |CP|4|AT|

{1NT-2S-2NT (instead of 3C) or 1NT-2NT-3C (instead of 3D)]}|CP||AT|. 

With less than good support, opener "rejects" the transfer by bidding the transfer suit 

|CP|4|AT|{1NT-2S-3C or 1NT-2NT-3D}. |cp||
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


AT|

This is somewhat counter-intuitive, as one would think the more natural way would be for opener to bid the suit to "accept" the transfer. However, the reason for doing it this way is that it is more likely that opener will end up as declarer.|
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


AT|

Again, this convention can be used for two purposes:
1. To allow responder to bid 3NT with a 6-8 point hand and a 6-card minor suit if opener accepts the transfer. Otherwise, the contract will be 3 of the minor.

2. To play in 3 of a minor with 5 or fewer points and a 6-card minor.|

{ 4-Suit Jacoby Transfers - Transfer to Minors }

^-|cp||cs||at|^B@2^Y@3

This version of Transfer to Minors is very powerful but can be confusing because the traditional invitational 2NT bid by responder no longer is available. To make an invitational raise to 2N (since a direct 2N is a diamond transfer), you bid Stayman first and then 2N. Therefore, if responder bids Stayman, on rare occasions she will not have  a 4-card major. You should have a thorough discussion with your partner if you would like to use this version of transfer to minors.|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |

One major benefit of this version is that the partnership  can use it to bid thin 3N games. For example, suppose your partner opens 1N and you have AQxxxx of diamonds. You might transfer to diamonds, and if partner bids 3C which shows 3 to the K, you bid 3N since you likely have 6 diamond tricks. Let me show you an example.|

{ Jacoby Transfers - Advanced Features }

It turns out that Jacoby Transfers have enabled experts to develop many sophisticated auction treatments. Let us look as a few examples.|

^-{ Constructive Auctions after a NT Opening Bid }

{ Should You Transfer to Minors? }

^-|HT|f|cp||FP||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|That has been my question and finally I received the following answer from Howard.|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


AT|

As a general rule, it is usually much harder to take nine tricks than seven tricks. And three of a minor requires that you take nine tricks whereas 1N requires you only have to take seven tricks. Therefore, unless you are pretty sure you are going to take three more tricks in a minor-suit contract than in NT, you should not transfer. (If you take two more tricks in a minor-suit contract, you break even.) So, how do you know if a minor-suit contract will yield three more tricks? |
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


AT|

Well, you don't. But here are some guidelines that work pretty well. If you have a 7-card minor and a weak hand, transfer. If you have a 6-card minor and shortness somewhere (a singleton or void) and a weak hand, transfer. Otherwise, don't bother.|
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


AT| 

By the way, this is essentially the same logic as to why you strongly prefer to play 3N as opposed to 5 of a minor. It is much easier to take nine tricks than eleven.|

{      Beginner Intermediate Lounge, Our Home      }
^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }

You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
