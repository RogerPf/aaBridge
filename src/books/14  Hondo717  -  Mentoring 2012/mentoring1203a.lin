^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That's a little light for a takeout double. I would personally overcall 1S, as I think laying claim to the spade suit is a good thing to do. But many do not like overcalling with such a weak suit. She has the distribution but not the HCP. Also, I tend to prefer showing 5 card major to making a takeout double even if 5/4 in the majors. However, given Toots weak spades, a takeout double (other than the lack of points) has merit. Let us bid on.|

ht|d|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|At least as of a few years ago, the most common method for bidding after a takeout double was as follows:

1) New suits at the 1 level are forcing and unlimited (same as if there were no takeout double)|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


AT|

2) New suits at the 2 level and above are weak, and show less than 10 points. (This principle is not understood by many less experienced  players.)|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


AT|

3) 2 level raises in the majors typically show 6-9 with 3-card support; 3 level raises show 4-card support and less than a limit raise.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


AT|

4) 2 level raises in the minors typically show 6-9 with 4-card support; 3 level raises show 5-card support and less than a limit raise.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


AT|

5) 2NT is Jordan 2NT, showing 4+-card support and at least limit raise strength (both in the majors and minors).|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


AT|

6) Redouble shows 10+ points and denies 4+ card support.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


AT|

I think there is a simpler way to play, and that is what I use. With 10+ points, you redouble with less than 4-card support and bid Jordan 2NT with 4+ card support. Any other bid denies 10 points and is not forcing (including new suit bids).|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


AT|

Having said that, playing my methods on the hand we just played, I technically should have bid 2N. If you play the common methods, then I could also have bid 1H, which is forcing.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


AT|

I suspect, in this deal, most of the time it would go 1D-P-1H-P-1N-P-3N, and be down 2 on a club lead. Another possible auction is 1D-1S (if Howard were East)-dbl-2S-P-P-3N. And then it might make if I can sneak a heart in before they discover their 5 club tricks or they pitch some clubs on diamonds. Let us look at the hand with the first bidding cycle.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's look at the hand. I guess Toots is in a bidding mood today, as she made another light bid :). Her hand does not meet the rule of 20, although it is a nice 11 with a couple of 10s. I personally like the rule of 20, which does mean you open all 12 point hands except if they are 4-3-3-3.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once Toots decides to open, it was a good auction. Cheryl must push to game with her hand, after checking for 3 hearts in the East hand using New Minor Forcing.NMF|

nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, Toots can hope for an even club split, and take 5 diamonds if lucky, 1 spade, 1 club, and hope the heart finesse works. The hand needs both red suit finesses to work plus a club split. Not a great chance but not hopeless.|

rcv: Why does E bid 2N rather than 2D?|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|if you play new minor forcing, then 2N is the usual response without 3 hearts. however, on this hand I think rcv makes a good point. Toots might as well bid 2D to show her 5 card diamond suit, in case that is relevant.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Lots to discuss here. First of all, Cheryl has a clear pass over 1C. Never worry if partner is short of clubs. You are more likely to get in trouble because partner has a good hand and will overbid thinking you have 6 points. Even if you play short club (which I don't recommend), you have to pass hands with less than 6 points.|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the defense. Toots has a tough hand to lead from, and made what turned out to be a nice lead. I am not sure why Vered did not return the suit.|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And the hand can be beat unless Cheryl guesses the spades correctly. Toots should not play the SA on the first spade making Cheryl guess. Playing the Ace guarantees the contract, because Cheryl already has 5 tricks, and she will get 1 more trump, plus the SK and the HK. You need to do second hand low smoothly :). It takes practice and good nerves :).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A couple of important things to remember here. The most important is "support with support." With 4 hearts, Toots must make some kind of raise, which she did. The next thing to remember is, even if you play limit raises, as opposed to Bergen Raises, you still should play cue bids in competition to show a limit raise. 3H bid by Toots is a weak jump raise, showing less than a limit raise and 4 card support.|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
luvbridge2: Why not Bergen Raise?|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bergen Raises only apply when your partner opens and the next person passes. Bergen Raises do not apply when you overcall. However, in a lesson I am giving soon, I will be talking about some extensions to Bergen Raises, where you can play them in competition.|
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I think I scared Cheryl by telling her she was a bit too aggressive before. I think there are at least 2 better bids Cheryl can make than pass. Double is a reasonable bid, showing a real diamond suit. I also think, despite the vulnerability, with such nice distribution and suit, 3D is a reasonable alternative.|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Vered made the correct lead, even if you play top of nothing. When you have not supported partner's suit, you should lead counta low diamond to show 3 is correct by Vered.  Had Vered supported diamonds, showing 3 or more, she should lead the ten as top of nothing.|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand also is a good illustration of why you should follow my competitive bidding guidelines. One of my important guidelines is, never let the opponents play at the 2 level when they have an 8+ card fit. On this hand, E/W make 4 diamonds. So letting us make 2 hearts is going to be a very bad result. Cheryl must bid 3 diamonds once Toots passes 2 hearts. Once in a while it will not work out, but more of the time, letting us play 2H will be a bad result for E/W.|
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, if you are sure the opponents have an 8+ card fit, and have stopped in 2, make sure you do not let them play there.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's do some planning. I have 2 spades for sure. 3 diamonds for sure and 2 clubs for sure. That's 7 tricks.  I can take this heart for my 8th trick and if I get lucky in spades, either the spade finesse working, a 3-3 spade break or the 10 doubleton, I make 9 tricks easily. Further, they can only take 3 more heart tricks at most.|

PG| ***** 135 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, in general, when leading back partner's suit you lead your "remaining count."Since you lead high low with a doubleton, with 2 left you would lead high. And if giving count, you lead low from 3 small, you lead low with 3 remaining. Counting is a very important bridge skill. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I know some of you are not mathematically inclined but, since there are only 13 cards in each suit, and suits usually tend to break reasonably evenly you can eventually memorize the important card count combinations as you get more experience.|

PG| ***** 151 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bthurston: ^*N|cp||at|The main focus of today's deals will be 1N as a forcing response to 1M - a frequent and critical component of 2/1. ^*BIt is only used as forcing over 1M and when the responder is an unpassed hand^*N. Usually assigned a range of approximate 5-11 HCP but some will use it when a bit stronger.|
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


cp|1|AT|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|I noticed that you drew a line in the sand5-11 HCP. It is obvious that the responder should pass with a hand less than 5 points and force game with a stronger hand. Now please tell us the main usage of 1N forcing.|
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bthurston: ^*N|cp||at|One main use is when holding 3 card support for partner's Major but not enough strength to raise directly as we use 1M-2M as constructive, ^*Busually with exactly 3 card support^*N.|
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


cp|1|AT|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|You added another very critical marker^*Busually with exactly 3 card support^*N. Even I know that with hands in ^*B5-11 points and 4 card support^*N we should use one of two Bergen Raise flavors. Please give us an example.|

CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play double dummy, you see all four handsits great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to take it. Now, you may lead the next cardfrom the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return back. |
