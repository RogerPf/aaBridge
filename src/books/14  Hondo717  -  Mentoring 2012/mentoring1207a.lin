^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First of all let's see if I should consider a club slam, and how might bid it with an expert partner. 6C by South is an excellent slam (it happens to go down because of the unlucky club break). But 6C by North is not nearly as good. The reason it is better if played by South is because of the hearts. If South is playing the hand, then the @HK is protected. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even if the opponents lead hearts, N/S have only 1 immediate heart loser if played by South. But if played by North, with a heart lead, East has to have the @HA in order for the slam to make. So this hand illustrates the principle that sometimes who declares makes a big difference. 6C by South only depends on a 2-1 club break which is somewhere around 85%. In fact, if East has 3 clubs, it still makes, as East can be finessed. So it  is upward of 90% to make.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The way I would get there is—the way I play—all 3 level bids over 1NT are natural and slam invitational. This is very non-standard, but I am not sure why, as I have gotten to many slams using this approach. So I would bid 3C, which is a slam invite with a 6-card or good 5-card suit. If the NT bidder has good support (3 to an honor), they start control bidding. If not they bid 3N, saying they do not have good support.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the auction with my partners would start 1N-3C. North should then fall in love with her hand. Great club support, lots of controls, great HCP, nothing wasted. The only issue is the heart suit. So over 3C the auction should go 3D (@DK) 3H by South (@HK) 3S by North (@SA). Now I know we have all suits controlled and bid 4N with a minor suit as trump. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even if you usually play 1430 you should play 0314 here with a minor suit being trump. Unfortunately, due to the very unlikely club break it goes down, but it is definitely a slam I want to be in (unless I peeked in the west hand :) ). So the complete auction is you will see next.|

annnew: Do you always play 0314 when it is a minor suit?|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I personally always play 0314—not 1430— particularly when the trump is a minor suit because that seems more logical to me. That way, at least in clubs, you can stop if pard has zero key card. But I know that is not what most people play.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The theoretical reason for playing 1430 is very unimportant for all but the world class players. I like 0314 because it is just more logical. The clubs shows 0, diamonds shows 1, hearts shows 2. Just like old fashioned Blackwood. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason for 1430 is the Q ask when hearts are trumps. It turns out that 1430 is a more common response than 0314 (but not by much). So if playing hearts, you can't ask for the trump Q over 5D but you can over 5C (by bidding 5D). That is why 1430 is just slightly better. but for most players, it is way more confusing, and I favor simplicity whenever possible.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are 2 schools of thought here about whether or not I should bid 4H. Some people say with 4-3-3-3, you should pass even with 3-card support. In Match Points (face to face bridge) that has particular merit, as making the same number of tricks in NT as hearts is better. |
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But in IMPs, the question is which is safer. It is easier to take 9 tricks in NT, than 10 tricks in hearts. Most of the time, they both will make. And since I have pretty good stoppers in all suits (the nine in @CK(9)2 swayed me, if I had @CK32 I would not like my club stopper) I will pass.|

UP|52|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In hearts I lose at least 1 spade, 1C and 1 heart, maybe 2. Therefore, on this hand 3NT is much better due to the bad heart break. In NT I could focus on diamonds but playing in hearts, I have to play hearts. This illustrates the danger in playing in an 8 card fit. |
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not saying that you should not bid 4 of a major with only an 8-card fit. But it can often be a dangerous contract, because trumps split 4-1 1/3 of the time. As I have said before, stretch to bid game with a 9-card fit, be more cautious with an 8-card fit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is one of my competitive bidding rules, Be reluctant to let the opponents play at the 2-level when you are sure they have found a fit. So I am just about obligated to balance here, no matter what I have even 3 or 4 points. Remember, balancing is about bidding the shared resources of you and your partner. Assuming competent opponents, the points should be pretty evenly divided between the 2 sides. |
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I don't have many points, it means partner has to have a pretty good hand. The adage about "add a king" to figure out when to balance is not really true. What you need to do is decide if your combined assets are approximately equal to the opponents. And if they are, no matter what you have, your partner will have a good enough hand to make your balance work out. Here I have a clear double.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As I mentioned at the end of Board 1, I think it is not a particularly good idea for non-experts to play the more confusing 1430, and it is too bad that is the popular method.|
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


AT|

0314 more closely resembles the old fashioned Blackwood you learn as a beginner, and is much more logical to me. In 0314 a lower bid means a lower number of key cards—5 C = 0, 5D = 1, 5H = 2. On the other hand in 1430 the illogical 5C = 1 5D = 0 5H = 2.|
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


AT| 

The only purpose for 1430 is for a very obscure reason covering a situation that rarely comes up. And that reason is, if hearts are trump, and the RKCB response is 5D, there is no way to ask for the HQ without committing to 6H. The argument for 1430 is that responder having 1 key card is more likely than responder having 0 key cards, so from a probability perspective, you will be able to do a queen ask in hearts slightly more often playing 1430. |
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


AT|

To me, the slight increase in probability does not, in fact, justify the extra confusion created by playing 1430. Not only that, but many experts have moved on to another solution. They play, when hearts are trump, 4S is RKCB, and they now use 0314. So, for example, say it goes 1H-P-3H (assume limit raise)-P-4S (RKCB for hearts)-P-4N (0 or 3 key cards). And 1S-P-3S-P-4N-P-5C is now 0 or 3 key cards. BTW, that 4S RKCB convention is part of a treatment known as "Kickback Blackwood".|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
