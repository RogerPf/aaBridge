^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you play 2/1, once Joan bids 2C, that establishes a game force. Therefore, the idea is to go slowly when slam is possible, to give you as much room as possible. |

mb|p|mb|3N|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Boater's 3NT bid is natural, denies 3-card spade support (with 3-card support, she would bid 4S with a min opener, 3S with a stronger hand to look for slam). Although 3NT could very well be the best contract, with 17 HCP Boater should be worried about missing slam. Another possible bid is 4C, which is a slam try, asking Bonnie to start control bidding.

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|6C actually has plays but is not easy to play. If the club finesse loses, it is very hard. Anyway, my only other comment is Bonnie should leave the bid in 3NT.  Boater could have a singleton or even void in spades. 3N is a bit easier to play.|

tjtoo: Splinter in Diamonds.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very good :). So why not make a splinter in diamonds.|

tjtoo: I wasn't sure I could still show a splinter in @D.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You can. Your diamond shortness is likely to be more valuable.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


mb|4D|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One important point here is, I play that when partner opens 1 of a major and you have 4-card support you must show it immediately. If you bid a new suit, that specifically denies 4-card support. Therefore, TJ should not bid spades. Some people don't play that way. But I highly recommend it, as does Bergen.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


mb|p|NT||sk|s|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4D is a great bid by TJ. Unfortunately, we have a bad fit. So slam is not likely. I have wasted points in diamonds. If, for example if I had 3 little diamonds, our fit would be much better.|

sk|w|SB|WI lead low from 3 - wrong ?|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


SB|sNot wrong. I will discuss after you make your lead :).|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


pc|S6|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's discuss what to lead from 3 small. Most people on BBO lead "attitude." That is they lead high from 3 small with no honor, low from 3 small with an honor. If Boater played that, she would lead the 10. The advantage of that is partner knows if you have an honor. The disadvantage is partner does not know how many you have. |
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


SB|W|SB|S|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other alternative is to play count from 3. So you always lead low from 3 whether or not you have an honor. That is what many experts prefer, as I do. But that only helps if you count out the hand. So you and your partner just need to decide which option you like to play. Boater's @s6 was fine so long as Bonnie understood what it meant.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The most effective time to preempt is when there is what is known as "favorable" vulnerability. That means you are not vul, and the opponents are. The reason is, it is more likely if you have a weak hand, the opponents have game. |
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if they are vul, the game bonus is much higher-500. And if you go down, even doubled, you don't lose as many points as if you are vul. Therefore, it is much lower risk and much higher reward to preempt at favorable vul so much so that some experts would open my hand 3H or even 4H.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


mb|p|sk|n|NT||sb|SOf course on this hand, I preempted my partner, but that is always a risk you take.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |

boater: Is 3@H bid by me a correct bid? I think I am furthering the preempt 6+2 hearts.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's discuss it. 3@H is not invitational, I should pass. Do you think game is possible with your hand?|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


nt|^b@2
boater: Possibly - depends on your points.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3H as Boater said is "furthering the preempt". it usually shows 3 hearts and a weak hand. With her hand 4H is better. With 19 points and an 8 card fit, game is likely. Unfortunately (as we will see later) the bad heart break does us in. But 4H is a very good contract, most of the time it will make 5, losing the HK and DA.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bonnie's S8 is fine encouraging spades. But there is actually an expert signal available to her. And that is to play the @SQ. That shows an honor sequence headed by the Queen. Most less experienced players do not know that signal and it rarely comes up. But we can give Bonnie the opportunity to signal like an expert :).|

texall: Since a 2H contract is worth 20 more points, should North bid 2H rather than pass 2D?|
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In IMPs, the extra 20 points are irrelevant. In live bridge, which uses different scoring, it might make a difference occasionally but it is over rated.|
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Despite what you may hear, even in match points (live bridge), you should bid the best and safest contract. Occasionally, you will bid a major and people who bid NT will do better. But just as often you will do better. So my advice is to bid the best contact, not the one that occasionally scores a few more points.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you want to keep it simple, always transfer with a 5-card major. But I play that you can pass with a 5-card major over 2N -- if there is no chance for game and responder's hand is balanced so they feel that an 8-trick contract is more likelier to be easier than a 9-trick contract.|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, notice there is a difference between opening or overcalling 1NT with 15-17 (18 for an overcall) and overcalling 2NT over a weak 2 which also shows 15-18. When you bid 1NT and responder has a 5-card suit, it is almost always easier to play in 2 of the suit than 1NT. That is why you always transfer, regardless of point count.|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In theory, the same applies after a 2N overcall. However, you are one level higher. So the question is, will it be easier to take 9 tricks in the major than 8 tricks in 2NT. To keep it simple, I say it is also correct to transfer with a 5-card major after a 2N overcall.|
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, there are a couple of other considerations. One is, should the NT overcaller be allowed to super accept to 4 of the major? Over 1NT, super accepting to 3 of the major is ok because it obeys the LOTT. |
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Two is, even with a 5-card major, is it possible 2N-overcall-is more likely to make than 3 of the major? That is tougher to answer.  It would be fine to decide that you should always transfer with a 5-card major. But if you wanted to decide to pass with a balanced 4-7 and a 5-card major, on the theory that with those hands 8 tricks are easier than 9, that would be fine too. But I don't recommend it :).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am destined to be down 1 tonight. Let's discuss Bonnie's bidding further. I am showing 15-18. Bonnie has 5. Therefore we have 20-23 between us not nearly enough for game. So Bonnie must pass and hope I don't go down too many. If she had a weak hand with 6 spades, then a transfer might be right, even though it takes us one level higher. But with only 5 spades pass is best.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you lead partners's suit, and you have not supported it, count is always more important. Even if Bonnie normally plays high from 3 small, on this auction, since she did not support clubs, she must lead count. Otherwise I cannot tell if she has a doubleton or not, and usually that is more important. |

{      Beginner Intermediate Lounge, Our Home      }
^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to as you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
