{      Beginner Intermediate Lounge, Our Home      }
^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Lets discuss the play first  then I will discuss raises over doubles. There is no reason for Toots to duck. In fact, if she does not she will make 6 because after drawing trump, she knocks out the @SQ, and pitches dummy's losing diamond on her 4th spade.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to raises after a takeout double, the standard treatment is raise to 2 with 6-9 with 3 card support, raise to 3 with 5-9 and 4 card support. With 10+ and 4-card support, you bid Jordan 2N and with 10+ and 3 or fewer card support, you redouble. 3@C and 3@D are weak jump shifts.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that, if you want to play Bergen over a takeout double, that is fine. That means 3C (assuming reverse Bergen) shows a limit raise, eliminating the need for Jordan 2N.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's specifically discuss the auction 1D-P-2C. In SAYC it only promises 10 points. But if you have less than an opening hand, you cannot have a 4-card major. In that case you cannot afford to take a 2nd bid over 2C if partner makes a minimum rebid.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So with 10-11 and 5+ clubs and a 4-card major, you bid the major. However, with an opening hand, with 5+ clubs and a 4 card major, you can and should bid 2C. That way you then show your 4-card major at your 2nd bid. You have both established a game force and nicely described your hand. Therefore, 1D-P-2C does not deny a 4-card major.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 2 over 1 the most popular treatment is to play 2C over 1D as a game force. However, I do not agree with that treatment. The reason being, you have a real bidding problem over 1D if you have 10-11 and clubs—you do not have forcing NT available. Over 1 of a major, you have the forcing NT to take care of the 10-11 club hand. I use the SAYC treatment, even playing 2 over 1, for the auction 1D-P-2C. That is, 2C only promises 10 points.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's review at the bidding in this hand. 1D-2C is fine. Cheryl has 2 choices over 2C. 3@C is one choice. 2@S, which is a reverse, is another choice. She has a borderline reverse. but I like that bid best.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|She has 15 HCP, a quality suit, and a fit for partner. Therefore, I think a reverse is justified. Counting Bergen Dummy Points, where 17+ is enough for a reverse, she has 15 HCP, 1 length, 1 quality suit, and 2 for singleton = 19. However, I suspect Toots did not notice the reverse. If she had, then she should bee thinking about slam. The 2S reverse establishes a game force over 2C.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now Toots with 17 HCP should be thinking of slam.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


AT|
veredk: Do we count singleton before reaching a fit?|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|They have a club fit and Toots knows they have a diamond fit, since the 2S bid shows 5+ diamonds and 4 spades.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4-4-4-1 hands are  problems, but you don't worry about them as they are rare. A reverse absolutely guarantees 5 cards in your opening suit. |
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A reverse is defined as a bid which forces partner to the 3 level to prefer your 1st suit. On this auction, the reverse only applies if not playing 2/1 over 1D and 2C is not a game force. Some 2 over 1 players play that once a game force is established, reverses no longer apply.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That was pretty straightforward, and 4S generally better than 3N given the diamond suit. On this hand diamonds unluckily block for N/S, but you cannot count on that. My only suggestion is that Toots continue to draw trump, even with the 4-1 break. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, you should draw trumps ASAP unless you have a good reason not to. I see no reason not to on this hand. In fact, had I started with a doubleton heart Toots would have gone down, as I would have scored my low spade. So you draw trumps in general to prevent the opponents from trumping with low trumps.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would say more often than not unless your spades are weak, and you have nice cards in the other suits Toots hand is close to passing, and I would not say it was wrong, but generally suits are easier to play than NT.|

Well there has been more attacks since the Radio lessons became popular in BBO. I feared at first that I will be out of movie making job. Then I decided not give in and make movies from the Radio lessons no matter the cost.|

So, I got my first attempt with Howard's open mentoring session on Tuesday February 28, 2012. I got two computers fired up. With one I logged in BBO and joined the session. On the other I fired up the Audacity to record the entire voice track. Just to make sure I can hear everything I placed my Boss headphone on. Within a few minutes my wife showed up and looked at the set up then moved my headphone and said, "Headphone or no headphone, you still are not learning much bridge."|

My next surprise was how to keep up with Howard. He talks so fast that my poor 74 year old ears could not keep up. His speed doubles when he likes a board and then there is no stopping him. Next, came the additional sound track probably added by Taffy chewing on the furniture. BTW, I think now by listening to Howard Taffy would be a better bridge player than I ever would be. Also, Howard's birthday is near. He can use a silent keyboard! I hope Ally is reading this.|

Undaunted I kept on and I was bent on making a movie at least from one or two boards. Quickly after the session I again used the Audacity application to listen and edit the recording. OMG, it was impossible to keep up. I could not possibly take notes fast enough. Later Howard mentioned a change in the setting to slow the pace down which I did.|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |

But now rather than having Howard's Brooklyn accent I was listening to a man with a Biloxi, Mississippi accent. I quickly undid the setting changes and back to the Brooklyn accent. BTW, please click |CP|1|AT| ^*Hwww.youtube.com/watch?v=1hrA9-6o4tI&feature=related^*N|CP||AT| and check out the accents of the 5 boroughs of NYC. let me know if you do agree. Sure, Brooklyn it is.|

Anyhow, you cannot stop a persistent old man. what you will see next are two boards from that night. It sure took a long time to make them. But it was a labor of love. Please enjoy. As a suggestion. Audacity is a great voice recorder, player and editor and is free. You can down load it from |CP|1|AT|^*H//audacity.sourceforge.net/^*N |CP||AT|site for the Windows and there is a Mac version too. What I will be doing from now on is record the entire session and later review the session using the playback and look at the boards at the same time. Would I make BBO movies from them? Don't hold your breath!|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me quickly go over the bids. Based on Bergen "adjusted HCP" when calculating the rule of 20 (raw HCP, quality suits, dubious shortness, adjust 3), East probably has an opener. Bergen probably say it is okay to open 1C. Personally I would pass. I might decide to open in 3rd or 4th seat (it's not really a "light" opener since it does meet the rule of 20). It is interesting that some of my students are more aggressive than the teacher.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have a clear 1H bid. Nanda made a very good bid of 2C. In general when partner opens 1C he has four clubs in 80% of time and if opens 1D he has four diamonds in 90% of times. So Nanda cannot assume 100% that partner has 4 clubs but it is highly probable that they have at least an eight card fit.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Patrick has a sure 3C bid as a limit raise for heart. He knows that we have at least 9 card fit. So 3C is the best bid he can make. The singleton club is a very powerful card. BTW, in regular plays there is no need to alert the 3C. However in BBO it is good to alert is. As you know unlike the regular live bridge in BBO the bidder alerts the bid.|
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have clear 4H bid. Even without the diamond Ace 3H has a good play and the bid by Patrick still would be sound. |

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return back. |
