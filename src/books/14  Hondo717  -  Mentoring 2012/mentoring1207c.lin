^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's count Bonnie's points. She has 19 HCP, has 2 length points, and has 1 quality suit point for 22 points. She should subtracts 2 for the 2 Qx suits—dubious doubletons, getting back down to 20 Starting Points. With 20 points, she has a game forcing hand. 3S is not game forcing. I can, and often do pass that bid. |
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also, her spade suit is "self sufficient." That means that it passes the "singleton test." If a suit is a reasonable trump suit when partner has a singleton, then it is self sufficient. So Bonnie has a clear 4S bid. |
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Usually responder is "captain", meaning responder is responsible for placing thee final contract. But when you open with a maximum hand (18+) and responder shows 6 or more then opener becomes captain, and must ensure the partnership gets to game. |
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In such circumstances opener must make a forcing bid or bid game. Jumping to 3 is not a forcing bid, it only shows a medium hand. |
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Opener has 2 rebids available that are forcing—jump shifts and reverses. A jump shift (e.g. 1C-P-1H-P-2S) shows a max (18+) opener and establishes a game force; the partnership may not stop below game.  A reverse (e.g. 1C-P-1S-P-2H) shows a medium or max hand (16+) and is a one round force, not a game force; if opener reverses with a max hand, opener is still responsible for getting their side to game.|

UP|44|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First the opening lead. A heart was good. But against suits, you lead the top of a 2 card honor sequence. So since  the @HJ10 is an honor sequence, the @HJ is the correct lead. I see many less experienced players lead 4th best against suits, when they have an honor sequence. As I will explain, leading a low heart gave Bonnie the potential for making the hand.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In NT there is a slight difference. There you need to lead top only when you have a 3-card honor sequence. The reason for leading top in suits is, against suits, often suits only last 2 rounds before being trumped. So you want to take fast tricks. But in NT, suits are not trumped, so  you can afford to  go slower.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4s was a reasonable contract. the heart lead is the only thing that gives Bonnie trouble, as it prematurely removes dummy's entry. So after the heart lead, the hand can be made, but it is very tricky. Bonnie is worried about losing 2 diamonds, 1 club, and 1 heart. But she does not have 2 diamond losers right away, since dummy has a singleton, and a trump.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The way Bonnie played the hand, she will always go down 1, losing 2 diamonds, 1 heart, and 1 club (unless the CK is singleton). On the other hand. The way the first 2 tricks were played (2 rounds of hearts), she has a chance to make it. So long as there is a trump on dummy, she only has 1 immediate diamond loser. However, as soon as she draws any trump, dummy is out so she then has 2 diamond losers.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Her best shot is to try and set up a trick in dummy for a discard. And her best shot is to immediately knock out the @CK by playing a low club at trick 3. On the actual hand, if East wins the CK and plays another club, West will ruff, and Bonnie will go down. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But:
a) On some hands, clubs will be 2-2.
b) On this hand, East may duck the club and Bonnie can then pitch a diamond on a heart.
c) East may win the CK and play a card other than another club, not figuring out that partner is out of clubs. |
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|An expert would figure that out, but an expert would also have led a trump rather than a heart at trick 2. The point is, it is easy to make a defensive error on this hand. Even a pretty good East might decide to lead a trump after winning the CK. And if East does anything but lead a club, Bonnie will make the hand.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand illustrates an important point about when not to draw trump immediately. And that is, when you need trumps in dummy to limit your losers in a suit (diamonds on this hand), you need to avoid drawing trumps and set up your other winners first. |
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I suspect if you review my declarer play lesson on drawing trumps, there will be a hand that illustrates this point. BTW, it just so happens that Marty's next voice lesson is on drawing trumps. Nevertheless,
This is a very hard hand to play. |

UP|52|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now we will discuss Boater's bid. I am all in favor of balancing. So in general Boater should not like us to play 1NT. However, balancing here is somewhat risky (although not totally out of line). And not vulnerable against vulnerable, balancing has some merit. |
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Boater was a bit unlucky that I had more points than TJ. Give Bonnie an average hand of 16. You don't know that for sure, but on average that is a good guess. I passed 1NT, so I have no more than 7. As a guess, say I have 5. So N/S could easily have 21 or 22 points at best, leaving at least 18 or 19 for E/W. Therefore, at this vulnerability, double was ok. The main problem is Bonnie is behind Boater, so all finesses are likely to lose, and that is a big minus.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|From a HCP perspective, balancing made some sense. But I would not balance because I am sitting behind the strong hand. On the other hand, reverse the positions of Bonnie and me, and now 2H has real plays.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to TJ's bid, 2H is clear. A nice 5 card suit with good intermediates. 2 diamonds is not nearly as good. True, it happens they have a diamond fit on this hand, and Boater only has a doubleton heart. But suppose Boater had a doubleton diamond instead. Don't think I like playing Qxxx opposite Kx as a trump suit. 2H rates to be the  best E/W contract on many hands.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, because Joan did open 1D, 2D would be ok. In general 2H is better, but because of the opening bid, 2D makes sense. If the auction for example went 1N-P-P-X, and that was a takeout double (you weren't playing DONT), then 2H would be clear.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With some clarifications, you have a opener TJ. Using standard evaluation the hand meets the rule of 20. However, the hand is only 19—10 HCP (subtract 1 for HJ) and 9 cards in 2 longest suits—if you use adjusted HCP—Bergen's method. But I do like the J109 of diamonds and you can bid 1S which is always a plus in a competitive auction (since the opponents have to go up an extra level to outbid you). So I would like to open the hand. But I would fault you if you pass this hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played TJ. Against many defenders you would make that hand. You have a clear opener, not light at all. In fact, Marty Bergen says opposite a limit raise, you should bid game with a singleton or void. With a better trump break, 4 has plays. Here you lost 2 trump tricks, and many times you will lose none. I would not mind being there (unless I peeked into the South hand :). 4S will make if the cards are a little friendlier. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Boater's nice 2nd hand low on the 2nd heart at third trick was a great play. It let her win 2 heart tricks. Had she not resisted the urge and played the @HQ, then she only takes 1 heart trick. So remember my most important rule on defense - 2nd hand low SMOOTHLY. It will win you many more tricks than it will cost you. If you watch any expert play, they virtually always play 2nd hand low smoothly.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
