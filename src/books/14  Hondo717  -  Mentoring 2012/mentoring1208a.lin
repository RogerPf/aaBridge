^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even if you play Inverted Minor Raises, they are off in competition. The reason being, once there is competition, you have other bids to show a strong raise. For example, on this auction, if Boater had a club limit raise, she would bid 2S. So 2C tends to show 6-9 with 4 clubs. |
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, with 4x3 hand only containing Queens and Jacks (derisively called "quacks" by experts) and only 5 HCP, I would rate the value of Boater's hand as 3 points or so, deducting 1 for the flat distribution and 1 for the quacks. Therefore, pass is probably a better bid but we accept the bid for now.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason I played the @SJ is to hide the fact from TJ that I had a 3rd spade. I wasn't really expecting to fool Bonnie. Since TJ did not raise spades, Bonnie can figure out she probably has a doubleton. But TJ might think Bonnie started with 6 spades, and ruff unnecessarily high. On this hand it probably makes no difference, but on some hands it might. As declarer—if it does not hurt you—you should hide what you have from the defense. This is one example.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bonnie's 2N bid shows an invitational hand with 5 spades. The important point is, 2N is not a close out bid. It is giving the NT bidder choices. Quite often the NT opener will not pass. Later I will discuss this bid further.|

NT||mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|sk||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|TJ's choices are:
a) she passes with a minimum NT (15 or bad 16) and 2 spades
b) she bids 3S (as she did) with a minimum  NT and 3 spades
c) she bids 3N with a maximum hand and 2 spades, or
d) she bids 4S with a maximum and 3 spades|

lb|*bWhat should West bid?^^4S|mb|4S|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once TJ bids 3S, Bonnie's hand is much better. She can now count declarer points. Why "declarer" points when Bonnie is dummy?|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


AT| When Bergen says "Declarer Points", what he really means is the "person with longer trump suit." On almost all auctions, the person with the longer trump suit is opener—declarer—because they mention the suit first and should use Declarer Point count. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On transfer auctions, however, the person with longer trump suit is the dummy. So, only on those auctions, when evaluating your hand, the responder (Bonnie here) uses declarer point count and the NT opener (TJ) uses dummy points count. Bonnie has 8 HCP, + 2 length points, -1 for dubious HQx, + 1 for quality suit, + 1 for side club suit, and + 2 for singleton which is 13 points more than enough to bid 4S. And if spades divide 3-2, it has good plays.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In SAYC, 3C would be a reverse. Some teachers call that a "high reverse", because it was done at the 3 level. It is a reverse because Bonnie bypassed her first suit to bid a 2nd suit. It shows at least 16 or so points. In 2/1 the meaning depends on partnership agreement. Some people play it shows extra values anyway, to make it easier to get to some slams. Others play it simply is bidding out your distribution. You just need to agree. I would say the more common treatment is it does not necessarily show extra values in 2/1.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Of course had spades not been bid, a spade lead by Boater makes a lot of sense. Or even if I had responded in spades, rather than Bonnie opening 1S, I could easily only have 4, and a spade lead still makes sense. |
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand however, Bonnie opened 1S showing 5. So a spade is more problematical. I would have led a heart, which probably does not work out all that well either. On the other hand, if a spade lead made sense, then the proper lead from AQJxx is the Queen. From hearts, @H9, top of nothing is standard in NT when leading a short suit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's discuss the bidding. A very important bidding principle is "support with support." Sometimes with a good hand and 3-card support, you can’t support right away, but on this auction, Boater's 1N followed by 2S showed exactly 2 spades. The reason being, with a weak hand and 3-card support, she should bid 2S right away. |
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some of you may decide that Boater is too strong for just 2S, and that is ok. But in that case then Boater has to show a 3-card limit raise and over 2H bid 3S to show 10-12 and 3-card support. Regardless of how you decide to evaluate Boater's hand, 2S over 1N does not show her hand. I personally would downgrade her hand with the flat distribution and consider it a 6-9 hand with 3-card support, and therefore, bid just 2S.  But if you want to treat her hand as a 3-card 10-12 raise, that is fine too. But then you must bid 3S over 2H.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Bergen Raises in Competition on certain auctions are something relatively new that I have been trying and I'd like to discuss them with you. As you already know Bergen Raises are off after interference. But, you can play Bergen Raises only over 1S and 2C overcall by your Right Hand Opponent. However, in competition Bergen Raises do not work if the overcall is 2D or higher. Let me show you a few auctions. BTW, I play Reverse Bergen Raises.|

So, only over 1S you can "have your cake and eat it too". 1H-1S-2S is a 3-card limit raise, 1H-1S-2N is natural (typically 11 or 12 with a spade stopper), 1H-1S-3C is a 4-card limit raise, and 1H-1S-3D is a 7-9 raise.|

Therefore, if you play Reverse Bergen Raises 3C is 10+ 4-card support, and 3D is 7-9 with 4 card support. I recommend you play Jordan 2N is a 3-card raise (since 3C is a 4-card raise).

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to as you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
