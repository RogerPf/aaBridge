NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I see many of you remember that you need a 3 card sequence in NT when you lead top. That's great. I am proud that you remembered that :). |
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason for that is, in 3N, you have time to establish tricks, so even if partner does not have an honor, there is still a good chance you will take tricks in the suit that you led. However, slams are a different story. There you are trying to establish fast tricks. You are not trying to take 5 tricks, only 2 tricks. So  against slams, NT or suits, if you choose to lead a suit with a 2 card honor sequence, lead the top of the sequence.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, against 3NT do not lead the top of an honor sequence unless you have 3, or broken 3 card sequence (e.g. KQJ KQ10 QJ10 QJ9 J109 J108) are all 3 card sequences.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's talk about whether 4C should be Gerber, and if 4N should be quantitative. I am not a big fan of quantitative NT. I have seen too many auctions where people get confused as to whether a 4N bid is quantitative or not—even experts. And even if partner recognizes it, it does not always get you to the right spot. So, if you wanted to play that 4N was always Blackwood, that would be a very reasonable way to play.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not quite that rigid, but I have very well defined rules as to when 4N is quantitative and I play that the only auctions where 4N is quantitative are five auctions.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had Toots, for example, bid 2H or 2S instead of 2D, then 4N would be RKCB for hearts or spades respectively. |

pg| ***** 65 ***** |


at| That is what I play. I know it is not perfect, but I never have bidding misunderstandings where partner passes 4N when I meant it as Blackwood. By the way, what I teach is very non-standard, and lots of experts would violently disagree with me.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT|^B@2
dragonfy:  How do you know how many Aces when bidding goes 2N - 4N which is saying I have good points but doesn't say anything about Aces or Kings.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Simple. As to how many Aces with 2N-4N, the assumption is, if partner bids 6, you have at least 33 HCP, so you cannot mathematically be missing 2 Aces. That sort of reinforces my first point, that quantitative 4N does not always get you to the best contract.|

veredk: If 4C is a slam try in Clubs, how should Toots respond?|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The best holdings when partner shows shortness are 3 or 4 small or Axx or Axxxx. Having a singleton or doubleton club, even with the Ace, is a detriment because that means we are both long in the other suits, meaning we have more potential losers. And as you can see on this hand, in fact, spades are a problem suit, since we both have long weak spades.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is close, but because I have a flat hand, my clubs are not ideal, and I have close to a minimum, I decided I do not have slam interest. On the other hand, if you bid 3D with my hand (control bid), that would not be crazy. Having said that, since we are missing 1 key card and the HQ, we end up in 5H anyway.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played Cheryl. Obviously we should not be in six. Had the Opponents chosen to save spades we lose 2 spades and about half the time, we lose 1 heart as well. So 4H is the correct contract. The Opponents should know to discard clubs based on the bidding.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's discuss Toot's options here. We are in  a game forcing auction so "fast arrival" applies here. That means if Toots jumps to 4H, that shows a weak hand with heart support. In the context of a 2C opener, a "weak hand" is defined as a hand with no Aces and Kings.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3H shows heart support and at least  one Ace or King. So Cheryl, you are only missing 2 Kings. You know Toots has at least one of those 3 cards. If she has either the HK or SA, I would think you should be in slam. And it is even possible she has both of them.|

^-|CP||FP||ht|c|at|^B@2^Z@3For me the session I had to turn over into a BBO movie presentation was a great learning experience. All the boards were chok-full with great teaching material. Howard went out of his way to teach and teach more. So I decided to follow his example and do the best of my Movie Making. I hope you learn and enjoy it as much as I did. BTW, I hope a bit of humor would not bother you.

That took a lot of time and all the resources I could bring in. So I had to cut CORNER. There is no bridge related material in the Movie Maker's Corner this week. However, I have more information on why I love to be a "Reformed Luddite." 

First is a TED video—Connected, but alone?—by Sherry Turkle who is a Professor of the Social Studies of Science and Technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology—Howard alumni. 
|CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.ted.com/talks/sherry_turkle_alone_together.html?utm_source=newsletter_weekly_2012-04-03&utm_campaign=newsletter_weekly&utm_medium=email^*N|cp||at|

If you get to watch this video please read the comments. 

Next is an amazing talk by Oxford neuroscientist Susan Greenfield who explains how new technologies are transforming our brains themselves, hence changing the way we think and the way we relate to each other. She explains how Internet communication short-circuits all the important aspects of human communication and how gaming and digital reality lead to a decrease in empathy in children. (You see I am not as crazy as you think!) Please check it out at |cp|1|at|^*Hiai.tv/video/mind-change^*N|cp||at|

And finally is ^*IThe Machine Stops^*N. A chilling short story masterpiece about the role of technology in our lives by E.M. Forster. It is written in 1909 but it is as relevant today as the day it was published. You can get it free from
|cp|1|at|^*Harchive.ncsa.illinois.edu/prajlich/forster.html^*N|cp||at|

Am I trying to talk you out of playing bridge and become a Reformed Luddite? I neither deny nor confirm :).|

{      Beginner Intermediate Lounge, Our Home      }
^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from the hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to that you experience it at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return back. |
