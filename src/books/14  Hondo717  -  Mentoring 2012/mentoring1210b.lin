^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding was pretty vanilla. Let's talk about the play. First the opening lead. I advocate 4th best in general, which is what Evar led. However, it is also usually not right to lead a suit the opponents have bid. Some might say clubs might not be a real suit, since you can open 1C with a 3 card suit. However, it turns out that about 85% of the time, opener has at least 4 clubs, so it is usually a real suit. In this case, I probably would pick my better major and lead a spade with Evar's hand.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let us look at it from Lisa's perspective. Once Deb wins the A, Lisa is pretty sure she has 2 club tricks, because Deb would have played the Q if she had AQ and Evar must have the Queen. Next when Deb leads back a diamond, and it wins Lisa is sure of 3 diamond tricks. That is 5 tricks. And there are 2 sure spades and 1 sure heart, so that is 8 tricks for sure. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The question now is, how best to play the hearts for an extra trick. Probably the best line is to cash the Ace of hearts first and then lead low towards the @hQ10. Hopefully, an honor will pop up from West, but if it doesn't, then you probably should play the 10. Even if that fails, when you get back to your hand, you can play low towards the Queen. |
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Basically, you are likely to take at least 2 heart tricks, and on good days, 3, as in this hand. Actually, as it turns out, you can make 4 if you play the hearts as suggested, however making 3 is still a good result.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I advocate opening 1N with a balanced hand and 15-17 HCP, even with a 5 card major. So I like West's bid.  The reason being, otherwise it is very hard for her to describe her hand on the next round of bidding. However, just to be "fair and balanced", I will say that there are some experts who advocate opening 1S with West's hand. But, I think the majority thinking has shifted to my point of view.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The Stayman Convention is used to find a 4-4 major suit fit in NT auctions. You should only use Stayman if you have a medium (8-9)  or maximum (10 or more) hand. Do not bid Stayman if you have a minimum (0 to 7 points) hand unless you play garbage Stayman, then you can bid Stayman when you are 4-4 in the majors with a minimum response hand.

PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The Stayman convention is initiated when the responder bids 2C.This is a completely artificial bid that says nothing about clubs. It is merely asking the NT opener if he has a 4 (or 5) card major. You should bid Stayman if you have a medium or maximum hand and your hand meets any of the following criteria:|CP|4|CS|1|at|^-

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you choose to lead a heart, the Jack is correct. However, that is likely to give up a trick, since the NT bidder is behind you. Coded 10s and 9s only apply when leading against NT contracts.  They do not apply to suit contracts.|

UP|20|nt|^B@2
Badmonster: Ok, there seems to be this big movement toward puppet Stayman. Some advocate only over a 2nt open, but lately I've seen people playing it over 1nt. Where do you stand?|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are plusses and minuses to playing Puppet Stayman over 1N. Puppet Stayman is a way to discover whether the NT opener has a 4 card major or a 5 card major. Without going into the gory details, basically, the way it works is over 2C, the NT opener only bids a major if they have 5 cards in it. If they have a 4 card major they bid 2D. If they have no 4 card major they bid 2NT.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The advantage is you can still open 1N with 5 card major, and find 5-3 fits. The disadvantage is 1) you can't play "garbage Stayman", where you are planning to pass whatever the NT bidder responds with. The other disadvantage is, for those who play 2N as a diamond transfer, you can no longer play that. |
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Anther problem is puppet Stayman is fairly complicated. However, none of these disadvantages are overwhelming, so if you want to play puppet, that would be fine. I mostly play weak NT, so the problem does not exist for me. However, when I play strong NT, I play 4 suit transfers, including 2N as diamond transfer, so I cannot play puppet Stayman.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My feeling is that most of the time, you do just as well in 3N as in a 5-3 major fit, so I don't consider it a big loss not to play puppet.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Many asked why I did not bid Michaels, since I have the suitable distribution. The reason I did not bid Michaels is I have strength outside my primary suits. In fact, more than half my points are outside those suits. Michaels tends to emphasize an offensive hand, with little defense outside your suits. Because my hand did not conform to that requirement, I chose to bid 1S. However, Michaels would not be unreasonable.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us look at East's bid. 1NT typically shows 8-10 with values in opponents suit. East is close, and has spade cards, and 11 HCP. Therefore, I find three reasons why I think there is a better bid. a) heart support, b) good 11 count, c) solid club suit.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are 2 choices. a 2S cuebid shows a limit raise or better. However, I play that 2S promises 4 card support, and she does not have 4 card support, and in fact the 3 card support is kind of mangy. The choice I prefer is 2C bid (they are not playing 2/1).  But even if they were playing 2/1, 2C is not a game force in a competitive auction. It has the same meaning as in SAYC - 10+ points, usually 5+ clubs, and forcing 1 round.I play new suit is forcing, even over an overcall. East can then bid 3@H later.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, probably, the best way to play the hand is to ruff a diamond and then draw trumps. You can then knock out the K and A of clubs. There is no need to ruff a spade before knocking out the club. The threat is that you might run out of trumps before the clubs were knocked out, and opponents might be able to take a spade or a diamond if you have no more trumps.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is something called the "law of total tricks", which is very useful in deciding whether or not to compete. Simplified, it says that it is safe to bid to the level that equals the number of trumps you have. If you have 8 trumps, it is safe to bid to the 2 level, which is 8 tricks. |
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you have 9 trumps, it is safe to bid to the 3 level. Here if I knew we had 9 trumps (say I had 5 diamonds), I would bid 3 diamonds. Next, if the hands are evenly distributed, and you have an 8 card fit, you should not allow the opponents to play at the 2 level. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this hand, I know we have 8 diamonds, so I will bid 3 diamonds, because I don't want the opponents to play at the 2 level. However, the opponents should not bid 3H over 3D unless they have a 9 card fit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, it is better to overcall a 5 card suit than double. The only exception is what is known as a "double and correct." A double and correct is when you make a takeout double, and then bid a new suit over partner's response. That shows a really good hand (at least 16 HCP) and a good six card suit. Since South does not have a double and correct, 1 spade is a better bid.|

^-{    The Stayman Replacement by Bergen   }
^-|CP||CS||AT|

When partner opens 1NT and RHO makes a natural overcall, your cue-bid serves as Stayman. The “Stayman cue-bid” is game-forcing, promising 10+ HCP and four cards in an unbid major.|

^B@2^*BM. Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Bid 3C. This is NOT Stayman, you’re just competing. Partner must pass. With a stronger hand, you would jump to 3NT. By the way: If RHO’s overcall is artificial, all bets are off. Many approaches are possible, so each pair must decide what to do.|

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
