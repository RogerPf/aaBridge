^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, I do not teach that you should bid a grand slam when you have all the key cards and the trump Queen. In fact, I teach that you should only bid a grand slam if you are just about positive it will make (80% or more). If you never bid any grand slams, in the long run you will come out ahead. You usually get a good result just for bidding a small slam.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you bid a grand slam that goes down, not only do you lose the probable good result of the small slam (probably averages at least 7 imps), but you give the opponents a large score (in the range of 12 imps). You will probably gain 7 imps of so for bidding the grand slam. So, you are risking losing 20 imps for a possible gain of 7 imps. That means the odds of making the grand better greatly be in your favor.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What you may be thinking of regarding my teaching is, once you decide you have enough points for a small slam and launch into RKCB, the decision of whether or not to bid small slam is cut and dried. You bid the small slam if you have all the key cards or if you have 4 key cards and the trump Queen.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this board, grand slam is not even a 50% proposition. You need a 3-2 heart break and a 3-3 diamond break. I put the odds at less than 40%.|

If you used a) you get to 18. If you used b) you also get to 18, because you subtract 1 for Jx but then add 1 for the quality club suit.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|By the way, I use a) because it mimics what most people do, and I find it gives me more consistent results overall. But I think b) is probably theoretically better However if you use b), your partners who do not use Bergen Hand Evaluation will get mad at you if you get a bad result, and they won't notice if you get a good result. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most people play for the drop in hearts with 9 missing the Queen. However, actually, that is often the wrong play. It is about a 51% play if you have no bidding to guide you. That means it is essentially equivalent to taking the heart finesse. And when there are bidding clues, it is often right to take the finesse. Here there are some bidding clues and that is Vered made a takeout double.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You could look at that 2 ways. You could assume Vered has most of the missing points, giving her the HQ. Or you could assume she is short in hearts because she played the 10. I am going to assume she was short in hearts because the only time the finesse is wrong is if she has Q10 doubleton. But if you wanted to play for the drop, that would be reasonable too. At a regular table, I think I would fines but hard to know for sure.|

up|52|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There were 3 important points on this hand. a) When partner reverses and you have at least 10 points, you are captain of the hand and must make forcing bids until you reach game
b) On many hands, when missing 4 hearts to the Queen, bidding clues make the finesse a higher percentage than the drop. The most common occurrence is when an opponent has shown a 5+ card suit. In that case, the odds very much favor the other opponent having the trump Queen.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reasoning is as follows: If you know 5 of one opponents cards, you only don't know 8 of their other cards. But there are more unknown cards in the other opponents hand. Therefore, it is more likely that one of the unknown cards is the trump Queen. Even if you don't understand the math, the principle is important. If one opponent shows a 5+ card suit, play the other opponent for the trump Queen with a 9 card fit missing the Queen.|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|c) Often if you run your winning tricks, you make it difficult for the opponents to discard correctly, and you end up with an extra trick you are not entitled to. That is the basis for  a squeeze, but even when you do not have a real squeeze, it is very easy for the defenders to make a discarding mistake.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Cheryl's reverse is definitely on the light side, but she has good shape and great HCP. 2 Aces 2 Kings and a quality suit. So I think it qualifies as a reverse and it does have the advantage of being a very descriptive bid.|

texall: Some might open Cheryl's hand 1 NT.|
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That's an interesting point. Some might. I personally think that one of the strengths of opening 1NT is it describes your hand very well. The description includes not only HCP (15-17) but shape as well. The legal shapes are supposed to be 5-3-3-2 4-3-3-3 and 4-4-3-2. |
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you start changing the shape you open 1NT with, you start losing the precision of opening 1NT. However, these days many people do open 5-4-2-2 and 6-3-2-2 hands 1NT. Some people even open 1NT with a singleton. I was sent a study which claims that if you open these off shape 1NT, you end up doing worse. but I can't claim that I know whether or not the study was statistically valid.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you think this hand qualifies for a reverse however, then I think 1C is a better bid, because the reverse ends up being more descriptive than 1NT.|

^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|It is clear that the 2C is artificial and I could not let it go. On the other hand I have a hand which can be an added asset for the partner, in any suit including the spades, who may have 6 or even 7 reasonably good cards in a suitnotwithstanding having only |CP|8|AT|3 HCP|CP||AT|. The spades seemed a bit suspect. Generally Partner would not bid a DONT double with 6 or 7 good cards in spades. A 2S would do. Most likely then the DONT double here is a long suit in the other three suits. Yes I could have simply passed as the Partner could bid again. But why not announce my great support even with measly 3 HCP. Even the spade support has merit as Howard may say.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You had great thinking on the board. With spades, partner usually bids 2 spades. So you are likely to have a 10 card fit in a red suit. Double (asking for partner's suit) was a great bid. By the LOTT you are safe through the 4 level. Points/schmoints!|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the hand, I think partner should bid 2S rather than doubling, but even with the double and correct to 2S, Qx is not bad support. Again, by LOTT, you have an 8-card fit. |

^-|CP||FP||at|^B@2^Z@3Bridge information stays with me as long as writing on the sand at the beach. It takes only one soft wave to wash everything away. However, as I get older I become more persistent and keep writing on the sand--reviewing the material over and over. This week I have something more interesting than ever. My best reward for making the so called BBO movies are when I get either a chat or an email from someone somewhere who believes my stuff are great and helping her/his bridge learning. With a few I have developed a friendship throughout the years and we are almost like two peas in a pod--in cyberspace of course.|

My recent dear friend is Margit BBO nickname (Rosalind0) from Germany. She claims, "^*IThe zero because I have zero knowledge^*N" which is not true at all. Also as you recall one of my so called masterpieces was the "restricted choice" which you can down load it from either the BIL library or Howard's web site.|

Now one morning last week between 3:00 and 4:00 when I was working on something I saw an email popped on my screen from Margit. I thought she needs help on one of the movies and quickly opened the email. By the time I finished the email I was laughing so hard that the porcupines in the canyonmy occasional room mateswondered what is happening. I have the entire email, with her permission of course, on the next page for your delight. However, it is worthwhile to look at the movie first.|

{    The Queen Sleeps Around    }
^-|CP||CP||FP||AT|^B@2^Y@3"Even when I first started playing bridge, around 61 years ago, it didn't make sense to me, but I tucked it away (|CP|8|AT|verstauen|CP||AT|) for future analysis rather than dismiss (|CP|8|AT|ablehnen|CP||AT|) it, because it was coming from AN ADULT. My friends and I were learning that wondrous game we'd heard about, and adults were dropping precious tidbits (|CP|8|AT|Appetithappen|CP||AT|) for us. The tidbit in question had to do with locating the Queen of a suit when the position of the nine was known. "^*IThe Queen sleeps with the nine,^*N" my mother's friends assured me. "^*IReally^*N," I thought, and awaited further information that would help me become good at the game. On the very next hand, sure enough, as foretold, there was the Queen in the very same hand as the nine. They were, indeed, sleeping together or, at very least, hanging out.|

A few hands later the Queen and the nine seemed to have argued or something, because they were no longer sleeping together. I pointed that out and was told the hand was a bit of an anomaly, to be expected on rare occasions.|
PG| ***** 142 ***** |

Over the years I've heard variations of the phrase, but the meaning was always the same. Sometimes it was "The Queen lies with the nine," or the "Queen lies over the nine," all uttered (|CP|8|AT|geäußert|CP||AT|)by straight-faced adults who let it rule their play. Watson, the wonderful player-statistician who wrote Play of the Hand many years ago, must turn flips in his grave  (|CP|8|AT|sich im Grabe rumdrehen|CP||AT|) over it. I, who am neither a wonderful player nor a statistician, can barely keep from screaming when I hear it. |

This week, playing with a very successful player, I was overcome with disbelief when she failed to take a restricted choice ? ? ? finesse, "^*IBecause^*N," she told me, " the Queen sleeps with the nine." That is not a statistic, I told her, trying to keep my voice under control, that is an old wives tale. Restricted choice odds, on the other hand, can be statistically verified. The advantage may be slim (|CP|8|AT|Vorteil mag gering sein|CP||AT|), but it is a REAL advantage.|

Sometime she sleeps with the nine, to be sure, but she's a slut (|CP|8|AT|Nutte|CP||AT|). Other times you'll find her with the other characters in her world, deuces and eights and fives and sometimes even the King, when he gets lucky."|

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play double dummy, you see all four handsits great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to take it. Now, you may lead the next cardfrom the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return back. |
