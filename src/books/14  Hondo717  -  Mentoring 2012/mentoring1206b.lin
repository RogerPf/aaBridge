^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The hand was played well. That is the best Bonnie could do. My only other comment is about TJ's 2C bid. Remember, even if you play inverted raises, they are off in competition. The reason being, a cue bid is available to show 10+ points and club support. |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So 2C  (and 3C) are both weak bids. 2C tends to show < 10 with 4 clubs, 3C < 10 with 5 clubs. I think TJ is strong enough to bid 2S, a limit raise in clubs. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, if she feels she is a bit weak for 2S, 3C should be bid with her 5-card support. It turns out they end up in either 2N or 3C, both of which make.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't mind TJ's double. In fact it is probably the best bid she can make. However, in general, I will overcall rather than double with a 5-card major. |
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Remember, I said suit length is very important and by doubling, TJ is only promising 4 cards in hearts not 5. This will make it harder for partner to apply the law of total tricks when deciding how many hearts to bid. However, on this hand, with relatively weak 5 hearts, and great support for the other suits, I think double is as good as bidding 2H.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


sk|n|lb|*mWhich one would be your choice for bid here?^Redouble~2D~Pass~Have no clue~2S^1|NT||MB|2D|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Lets talk about how to compete over a take out double. The most important principle to remember is, if you do not redouble, you have less than 10 points. So Boater's 2D bid, shows essentially a weak 2 in diamonds. It does not show a strong hand. This is an area many less experienced players have trouble with. New suits over a takeout double are weak, not forcing, and show less than 10 points.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


AT| So, let us give Boater an undo so she can make the correct bid.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


UB||mb|r|SB|SNow that is the correct bid.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


sb|S|sk|e|NT||mb|2H|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bennie's bid of 2H does not show any points. It is simply a preference for one of TJ's suits. She can bid 2H with zero points. Think about it this way. I have an opening hand, so does West, North showed at least 10, that leaves very little for Bonnie on many hands. So 2H cannot show much, just by mathematics. In fact, on this hand, Bonnie is well above average in terms of what she has for HCP.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very nice bid by Boater. That shows 3-card spade support, and not quite enough to bid 4.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since I have a minimum, I should pass as well particularly with an 8-card fit and flat distribution. One good principle to remember, when deciding whether or not to bid close games is be conservative with an 8-card fit, aggressive with a 9-card fit.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me explain why I know North only has 3-card support. When I discussed the proper bidding after a take out double I should have also mentioned the Jordan 2NT. Had the auction gone 1S-X-2N, it shows 4-card spade support and a limit raise or better in strength. That is not Jacoby, it is Jordan. |
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now then, since North did not bid 2N, but redoubled instead followed by raising my suit, I know she only has 3-card support. Hence I will be conservative and not bid game. Had she shown 4-card support I might very well have bid game. Remember, HCP are only one part of how you measure how good  your hand is, and are often overused by less experienced players. Suit length and shortness are also very important. |
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But there are a couple of things to consider here. West did not bid 4H right away, so obviously she does not think they have the points to make it. If they make 4H, we are probably getting a bad result. So as I do not have much defense, I cannot let them play 4H. I must either double or bid 4S. Even if they make 4H, the extra points they get for making it doubled are probably not going to affect my score much. I am not willing to bid 4S so double is my only option.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now of course I wish I had led a trump but we shall see. Actually despite the fact that Bonnie could have zero points, TJ has a great hand. Hands with voids are incredibly powerful. With her void in spades, we are playing with a 30 point deck. Our 10 HCP in spades are now worthless.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very nice try Bonnie. well played. Here is a great example of where distribution is so much more important than HCP. They have 16 HCP, we have 24 and yet, Bonnie had a good shot at making 4H. In fact, I suspect if she were not playing against expert defender(s), she would have made the hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's discuss TJ bidding 1S vs 1D. Many people bypass diamonds to bid their major and that is a very reasonable way to play. However, another reasonable way to play is to only bypass diamonds if you have a weakish hand (10 or less). Otherwise you can bid diamonds and then bid spades later.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, TJ 1S is fine. I was just explaining an alternative, albeit a slightly more complicated one. Since I am generally in favor of simplicity, always bypassing diamonds is a good way to play.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Remember, as responder, you are almost always "captain" of the hand. That means, if partner opens, and you have an opening hand, you as responder are responsible for making sure your side gets to game. So you must as responder make forcing bids until you figure out what game to bid.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|in this case, TJ clearly knows 3N is our best game, as I cannot have 5 hearts, and I would have supported spades with 4. So 3N is the best bid. TJ, bid 3N after the the undo.|ub||

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although this lead did not work out, Boater chose the lead I would have made. In the long run, 4th from longest and strongest against NT (assuming the opponents did not bid the suit) works better than anything else.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So nothing much to this hand, just remember to figure out how to come to 9 winners. You always must plan as declarer. Look at all 4 suits and figure out how to take enough tricks to make your contract. And, of course, as I mentioned before, as responder you are captain and must make sure your side gets to game when you have an opening hand opposite an opening bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I am captain and, because I have an opening hand, and heart support, I must make sure we get to 4H. However, I should not bid 4H right away as that is a weak bid showing long hearts and less than a limit raise. Most of you play a 3D bid by me shows a limit raise. But there are two styles to the cue bid as limit raise. One style, which is fine but which I do not prefer, is that the cue bid—3D here—can be done with 3-card support. Therefore, so many of you would bid 3D with my hand and that is fine.|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, I prefer that a cue bid promises 4-card support. As I mentioned previously, knowing you have a 9-card fit is important. It often tells you whether to be aggressive in bidding or not. With the same HCP, a 9-card fit will usually play a trick better than an 8-card fit. The 9th trump often is crucial. One important reason is that you don't have to worry as much about bad breaks.|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With an 8-card fit, trumps break 3-2 about 2/3 of the time. certainly well more than half, but not close to 100%. So 1/3 of the time, a defender will have 4 (or even 5) trumps and that can be the difference between making and going down.|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With a 9-card fit, trumps break 3-1 or 2-2 90+% of the time. So you need not worry about a bad break. The important concept here is love your 9-card fits, but be cautious with your 8-card fits. Therefore, I like partner to know, when possible, that we have a 9-card fit which is why I prefer a cue promises 4-card support. Thus, I will bid 2S and raise hearts later.|

UP|34|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A couple of points to discuss. Although Boater's 3D bid is a bit too aggressive, it is not totally without merit. The Law of Total Tricks says that it is ok to bid 3D with a 9-card fit, and Boater know they have a 9+-card fit. On the other hand, with such a weak hand, I would prefer another diamond and/or more distribution (a singleton or void) particularly vulnerable.|
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 3D bid is not outlandish, even though it might appear that way to some people. Remember, the LOTT is the best way to determine how high to bid in a competitive auction. If you follow it, you will bid better than a majority of bridge players. In 3D they actually don't do that badly. They take 4 diamonds in Bonnie's hand, plus 2 spades, plus 2 ruffs in Boater's hand—only down 1. Even doubled, -200 is better than the 650 N/S made for bidding game.|
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One other comment, Bonnie's opening lead. Normally, Ace from  Ace-King is a very strong lead. However, in general, leading a suit bid by an opponent should be avoided as it normally sets up tricks for the opponent. On this auction, I would have led the @DK, particularly since Boater raised. And certainly seeing the SQ on the board, a switch to the DK at trick 2 is indicated, rather than setting up the @SQ.|

However, as I get older I become more persistent and keep writing on the sand--reviewing the material over and over. This week I have another section from all important Howard's recent lesson titled ^*IRaises in Competition^*N which should be a must review by all aspiring bridge players. You can down load the entire lesson from either the BIL library at |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bilbridge.com^*N|CP||AT| or from Howard's web site at |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/^*N|CP||AT|.

^-{    General Approach after an Overcall - Minor Suit Opening    }
^-|CS||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Following an overcall of a minor suit opening by partner there are several important points you should always consider before making any responses.|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


AT|

1. The game chances are not as likely when your partner opens a minor suit. And it is more likely the opponents can out bid you at the same level in the majors. So your objective is to get in their way promptly.|
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


AT|

2. Inverted Raises are off.|
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


AT|

3. A cue bid is available to show a limit raise. Therefore, there is no reason to play a raise to 2 is strong.|
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


AT|

4. When opening one of a minor, 85% or more of the time partner will have 4+ cards although it is possible that partner only has a 3-card suit. So bid as if he/she does have four.|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


AT|

5. Your first priority as in constructive bidding still is to show a major. |
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


AT|

Absent a major your hand either is worth 6-9 or 10+ points.|
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


AT|

With less than six points you pass.|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


AT|

Bid 1NT with a stopper in the overcaller's suit and 8-11 points.|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


AT|

Raise to 2 with 4 card support and 6-9 points—no 4+ card majors.|
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


AT|

Jump raise to 3 with 5 card support, 6-9 points, and no 4+ card majors—note additional trump card needed.|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


AT|

With 10+ points and at least 4 cards in opener's suit (assuming you have no major suits) cue bid.|

NT||lb|*bWhat would you bid?^^X|mb||nt|
^b@2Double is probably the best bid. And that is what I recommend. But with such nice clubs and bad hearts, if you decided to bid 2C, I would say that would not be a bad choice either.|

pg| ***** 146 ***** |


NT||lb|*bWhat would you bid?^^3c|mb|3c|nt|
^b@2Here the choice is not as clear. Most people would double and that might work out when partner has a strong hand and hearts. But remember you only have an 8-card fit at best in hearts (partner would open 1H with 5) and they probably have a spade fit. So tactically I like 3C better. |
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It makes it harder for them to bid in spades and you are likely to have a 9-card fit. At least partner will probably be better positioned to compete when you bid 3C. Therefore, despite my 4 hearts, I recommend 3C (but if you want to double, that could work out on some hands).|

pg| ***** 150 ***** |


NT||lb|*bWhat would you bid?^^1n|mb|1n|nt|
^b@2Both 2S and 1N are possible. 2S identifies your strong clubs. It also is more preemptive, always good in competition. On the other hand 1N shows your points, spade stopper, and is more precise. I would lean towards 1N, unless playing against a real strong pair, where I want to get in their way with 2S. Either is fine.|

^b@2This is similar to the previous hand, but you have a 5th club. Again both 1N and 2S are possible. But on this hand with our likely 9-card fit I favor 2S over 1N.|

pg| ***** 156 ***** |


NT||lb|*bWhat would you bid?^^2s|mb|2s|nt|
^b@22S is the best bid. You could conceivably end up playing in a 7-card fit at the 3 level but that is extremely unlikely. Partner is almost certainly short in spades making it very likely he or she has 4+ clubs. Therefore, 2S is very clear and low risk.|

{      Beginner Intermediate Lounge, Our Home      }
^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to as you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
