^B@2^*BMM: ^*NWe are going to demonstrate important teaching parts of this board in separate segments. So please be patient. First a few points on the bidding.|

PG| ***** 5 ***** |


SB|S|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I prefer the "System on - Double Stolen Bid" system to the very complicated Lebensohl convention. Here by doubling Daria is showing 5+ hearts. With five spade Daria could simply bid 2H which is the regular transfer to spades. Let us move on to East.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


sk|E|NT||lb|*mWhat is the second suit implied by West?^Clubs~Spades~Hearts^2|lb|*bWith the gleaned information please make a reasonable bid for East^^2s,p|mb|p|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East has two good options. First, he can pass because of good defensive values. On the other hand his partner bid DONT implying diamonds and another higher ranking suit-most likely spades-as Daria is showing 5-card hearts and I should have at least 2. So 2S is another good bid. However, personally I pass and try to defend the eventual 2H auction.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NLet us go back to what happened at the table and look at the 2D bid by West.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I strongly suggest bidding DONT over strong 1N opener particularly in the direct seat. This is a great hand for DONT. Technically the bid here is 2C. But West has good diamonds, the clubs are very weak, and is void in hearts. So I choose 2D for my bid showing diamonds another higher ranking suit.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NThis is rather an easy board to set up for the movie. The question is whether West should overcall 1S or 1N. Then we look at the correct opening lead.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


mb|p|mb|1H|NT||lb|*mWhich action should West take?^Overcall 1S~Overcall 1N~Pass^2|mb|1N|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|All considered 1N overcall is the better choice. West has the points for 1N overcall, it is more descriptive, expects to get a heart lead, her minor suits are not great. 1S overcall would be a better bid if her heart suit was not as good. Further, West know that her partner cannot have many points and probably could not raise.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2C is the correct bid.  With six-card spades she would rebid 2S. Marty Bergen says that you can treat a 5-card suit of AKQJX as a six-card suit. However, it has not worked for me nicely. So West should bid a 4-card suit if has one. Not having one then West should bid the best 3-card suit-clubs here.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, I will think about it -:). Second seat, for obvious reasons, is the least favorable seat to pre-empt. The best location to pre-empt is third seat and the next is the first seat. The other important factor in pre-empting is vulnerability. The best is when they are vulnerable and you are not. The vulnerability in this had is okay-non-vul against non-vul. Finally, the quality of the spades suit is below par though by itself is not a major detriment. After all said and done pass here is the better bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|All bid such as Stayman and transfers are on as West originally opened 2N but with more points.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||lb|*mWhich would be your bid assuming you plan to transfer to spades?^3H~4H~Either^2|mb|3H|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As I mentioned in my another mentoring session there is a distinctive difference between regular transfer (3H) and Texas transfer (4H)-assuming you play the Texas transfer. Here East does not have enough strength to have slam interest and wishes to play in 4S. Then he should tell his partner "We are playing in 4S period." by bidding 4H.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand with an stronger hand East would bid 3H and then raise the 3S by West to 4S. That shows mild interest in slam. However, this is applicable only if both partner play Texas transfer in addition to regular transfer and they have fully discussed it. Otherwise, the regular transfer is just fine. Most non-experts do not know this and it is okay for you to just play the regular transfer as East did here.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is something I have been saying often and for a long time. When defending you play the lower of the touching cards. That tells partner that you may have the higher card. However, as declarer you like to hide your honors and play the highest touching card. Now I clearly place the @DA in West's hand. That could be very important information for the defense.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NHoward called it a boring hand and made the contract. Before you can play it double dummy you should read his explanation-from his web site-for whether 2C after 1D opener should be game force or not.|
pg| ***** 127 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The first is a response of 2C over 1D. The modern tendency is to also play that as a game force. The problem with that approach is that the forcing 1N bid is not available over 1D, so you have a problem with an invitational hand with a good club suit. I personally prefer to play that auction has the same meaning as it does in Standard American, showing at least 10 points but not game forcing. However, if you want to play that as a game forcing auction, and bid 1N or 2N with the invitational hand with clubs, that is certainly workable.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to as you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
