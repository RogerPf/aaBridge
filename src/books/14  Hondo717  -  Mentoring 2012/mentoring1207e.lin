^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Many experts open my hand 2S in the third seat. In fact some may even open it 3S. After two passes mathematically the opponent to the left has a good hand—after two passes I show 5-10 points. So, it would pay off to disturb the next opponents bidding. |
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Marty Bergen and I along with many other experts would open a hand Weak Two even with four card major side suit. The strict requirements of holding two out of three or three out of five honors is not adhered to by many experts. Further, even those who follow such rule would relax the rule in third seat particularly none-vulnerable.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


sk|w|NT||lb|*mWhich would be a good bid here?^Double~2N~3N~Pass^1|mb|d|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|All considered the double is the best bid particularly if Qian would bid 3N on the next round. He is assured that partner would not pass because Stan cannot have too many spades to pass. Further, with 23 HCPs Qian is too strong to bid 2N. The alternative would be to bid 3NT and get it over with. So we will see what would be Qian's next bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss the bidding and explain why with many hands including this one you can reach a good contract playing 2/1 while exploring slam. That would be difficult to do so playing SAYC.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|After 2D Stan has trouble showing his hand which he wishes to force game. Neither 2S nor 3S are forcing. 2N is a bit of underbid and 3N is an overbid. He really has a 2 1/2 spade bid which he cannot make. On this hand they probably make 12 tricks but they should not bid 6S as there are two Aces out.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Playing 2/1 East/West have an easy shot at reaching a slam. With heart Ace instead of heart King in West hand or East holding club Ace instead of club King slam would be cold. However they would not have enough space to explore slam when they play SAYC. On the other hand, as you noticed playing 2/1 would make it easy and safe to explore for slam. That is why most experts play 2/1.|

Because when I bid 2S—showing five spade Qian would have bid 3@S with a 3-card support. So he should cash his ace before it becomes irrelevant.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a difficult hand to defend. As you will see soon Daria is end played and Qian gets a trick not entitled to. Most experts would figure this in advance and play the heart Jack before playing any other card to avoid giving declared a ruff and sluff. But as I said this a complicated defense and most non-expert would not find this line of defense.|

up|52|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played Qian. I discussed the end play. Now, let me discuss what is a good bid after 2S. North has only six cards in hearts which are not very good quality—would not be a good trump suit opposite a singleton in partner's hand. So I would not bid 3H. With 17 starting points and good clubs and diamonds I would bid 2NT or even 3NT—if you want to be really aggressive—after South shows spades and ten points. 3NT is very tough to play because of limited entries. So my choice for bid is 2NT which is very descriptive of North's hand.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I understand in actual play North made 4. But it should make only three—North should lose a club, two hearts, and a spade. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would not open this hand because it does not meet Rule 20. Daria has 12 HCPs and 7 in the two longest suits. Generally you should not open flat 4-3-3-3/12 counts hands unless you have really quality suits. But let us accept the bid by Daria for now.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Stan has an opener and he knows their partnership has game. Further, it is true that you should show your major. But the best bid here is 2C—showing your good 5-card club suit. Over 2C Daria probably would bid 2N and Stan can bid 3S—game force showing 5 clubs and 4 spades. The bid by Stan would give Daria the choice of bidding 3N or 4S. Again let us accept the 1S bid by East and continue the bidding.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is not a correct bid whether you play New Minor Forcing (NMF) or not. You need five spades to bid 2C if you play NMF which East does not have. If not playing NMF then 2C is to play. So, let me undo the bid and Stan can make the proper bid in this sequence.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First important point is when partner opens one of a suits—either 1D or 1H—and you have 4 spades and five clubs you bid 2C first when you have an opening hand. Then you bid the spades. This clearly shows an opening hand, 5-card clubs, and 4-card spades. With less than an opener then you should bid your major first.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This bid is the principle of "Fast Arrival" which means I have a weak hand for game in hearts and I am not interested in slam.

So the weaker your hand is the faster you arrive at bidding game and the stronger the hand the slower would be the bidding.|

However, as I get older I become more persistent and keep writing on the sand--reviewing the material over and over. This week I have a portion of ^*IFundamentals of Constructive Bidding^*n lesson by Howard which deal with the question asked by Princesess during the play of Board five.

^-{^*BIntroduction to Constructive Bidding^*N} 

In this lesson, we will learn the basic principles of bidding, regardless of whatever conventions or treatments you play.
If you understand these principles, you will become a very good bidder, even if you play a very simple bidding system.
In fact, most very good money bridge players use a very natural style of bidding,
following these principles and using very few, if any, conventions. 
As one rubber bridge player once remarked to me after I watched him demolish
a pretty good duplicate bridge partnership using his very simple bidding style, 
"Match points (tournament bridge) is an interesting game, but it bears little resemblance to bridge".|

{^*BBidding Objectives^*N}

Non-slam auctions have only 2 simple objectives:

1. Bid game if possible, otherwise stay as low as you can.

2. Find a good strain (trump suit or NT).|

You may have learned all these complicated bidding rules, but their only purpose is to
help you fulfill these simple objectives. In this lesson, I will teach you how to meet the first objective,

subsequent lessons are related to meeting the second objective,
|FP|2|AT|finding a good strain.

^B@2^Z@3^*BMovie Maker's Note^*N|CP||AT|: In all of these lessons, Howard assumes the reader uses traditional hand evaluation techniques--see more in a separate section. However, he now teaches, and prefers, the more accurate Bergen methodology (again see details in a separate section), but, because it is not familiar to everyone, he will not use it in these lessons. However, next, for comparison I arranged some of the information side by side. |

During the auction, both partners should always be thinking about whether it is still possible to bid game. For example, if your partner opens and you, as responder, have a maximum (12+) hand, you should bid game. Similarly, if you open with a maximum (18+ with traditional count and 20+ with Bergen's count) and get any response from partner, you should bid game. |

{      Beginner Intermediate Lounge, Our Home      }
^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to as you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
