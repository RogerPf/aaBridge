The lowest  honor sequence from which you lead your highest honor is 109. You lead low, for example from 98xx (the 9 is not an honor, so 98 is not an "honor sequence").|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although theoretically, because I doubled, West could pass with as much as 6 or 7 but West probably has less. You don't want to play 1NT with combined HCP less than 20 especially when the strong hand is sitting behind you, so most finesses are losing. It is rarely right to rebid 1NT opposite a passing partner.|

PG| ***** 32 ***** |


ub|2|AT| The easiest way to play is as follows:|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


AT|

Any bid except redouble and 2N shows less than 10. I am not saying TJ should bid 2C, but had she bid 2C, that would not show 10 points. In fact it tends to show long clubs and a weak hand. |
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Many less experienced players think 2C shows 10+ points after an interference. But that is incorrect. The only way to show 10+ points is to redouble. All other bids except 2NT deny 10 points over a takeout double. 2N by partner after a takeout double is known as Jordan 2N which shows a limit raise or more.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On a different hand, had the auction gone 1S-X-2N, that is a limit raise or better in spades. However, the important point here is, new suits are not forcing and deny 10 points over a takeout double. So, I recommend you keep it simple:
^ca) redouble or bid 2N to show 10+ points
^Cb) new suits are not forcing and deny 10 points.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*N|cp||at|To illustrate Howard's teaching I will change North's hand and determine the proper bidding. Please note that the hands value and its distribution change. In this effort we would try to show the hands which North may reasonably hold—freakish distributions are not included. For more in depth explanation please see the Movie Maker's Corner in this presentation. After completing this section which was not in the live session we will take where we left off.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Welcome back :).|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


AT| Now, let us count her Bergen dummy points. She has 4 HCP, 2 length points for the 6 card suit, plus 2 points for the singleton. So her hand is worth 8 dummy points which is more than enough to bid 2S—her best bid. Her hand is actually a lot better than many 6 HCP hands where she would bid 2S. |
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, 2S by TJ shows exactly 3-card support. Even if you do not play Bergen Raises, remember I said only redouble and 2N show 10+ points. Therefore, a bid of 3S by TJ would show 4-card support and less than a limit raise. It is very good to know if you have an 8 or 9 card fit. A 9 card fit almost always plays a trick better than an 8 card fit.|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One more point. HCPs are only one measure of how good your hand is. Long suits and shortness once you find a fit are also important. Particularly in a competitive auction, strain to support with support.|

That gives me 19 points after subtracting 1 point for @hJx doubleton. That is enough to bid 4S. I am, however, a tad worried because of the 8-card fit.|

I can possibly ruff 3 diamonds but only if they are 4-4. The spade finesse might work but I think my best bet is to try and ruff 3 diamonds. To that end, I need entries back to my hand, so I need to preserve the @CK and I play the @CA at trick 1.|

^-|CP||FP||CS||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's go on to bidding over a takeout double. I will discuss the double over one of a major opening first. One important point I like to emphasize first is that a new bid by responder shows less than 10 points. For example 1H-X-2C is less than 10 points—keep that in mind. |
PG| ***** 191 ***** |


AT|

Some people play something slightly more complicated, which I do not particularly care for. All one level bids over the double are forcing and can be made with 10+ points, but 2 level bids are not. I find that very counter-intuitive and confusing. Using that system 1D-X-1S can be and often is stronger than  1D-X-2C.|
PG| ***** 192 ***** |


AT| 

The second important note is the 1H/1S-double-1N. In this auction 1NT promises 8-11.|
PG| ***** 193 ***** |


AT|

The third important note is that Bergen Raises are off after competition (unless you agree otherwise). I will discuss this topic later.|
PG| ***** 194 ***** |


AT| For ease of explanation let us divide the responder's hand (your hand in quizzes) in two categories:|
PG| ***** 195 ***** |


hT|n|AT|^CA. Hands with 6-9 points.|
PG| ***** 196 ***** |


hT|n|AT|^CA. Hands with 6-9 points.
^cB. Hands with 10+ points.|
PG| ***** 197 ***** |


at|

In category A—with 6-9 and support for partner's suit you bid based on the Law of Total tricks.|
PG| ***** 198 ***** |


AT|
Bid 2 with 3-card support (just like after an overcall).|
PG| ***** 199 ***** |


AT|
Bid 3 with 4-card support and less than a limit raise. In competition you want to play weak jump raises. Remember the Law of Total Tricks is your friend :).|
PG| ***** 200 ***** |


AT|
Bid 4 with 5-card support.|
PG| ***** 201 ***** |


AT|

In category B—with 10+ points you redouble with 3-card support.|
PG| ***** 202 ***** |


AT|
You should bid 2NT (Jordan 2NT) with 4-card support and limit raise or better.|
PG| ***** 203 ***** |


AT|

Some experts recommend bidding redouble with 10 points holding less than 3-card support and bid 2NT with 3+ card support and limit raise or better. |
PG| ***** 204 ***** |

Let us look at some examples for 1 of a major followed by take out double. Bergen Raises are off (unless you agree otherwise).|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to as you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
