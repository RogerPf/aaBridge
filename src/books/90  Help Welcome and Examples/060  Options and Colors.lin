^b@2The  Options and Preferences  are accessed by the divders on the right and bottom off the main display. These can be moved right-left and up-down respectively. 

The divider on the right exposes a set of tabs.  It is worthwhile looking to those tabs to see what choices are on offer.

The suit colors are adjusted with the "Suit Colors" tab, move the divider on the right.  The screen colors can be adjusted by using the sliders revealed by the bottom screen divider.
