I have to thank the many lin file authors whose work is colleted here.  In particluar I need thank Kia, the author of the majority of the Bridge Movies that form this collection.


Most of all I need to say a huge thank you to Howard Schutzman for his unceasing work spreading the game of Bridge and of course, for his web site @- ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge^*n.


It it was not for Howard's site and Bridge teaching, which Kia has captured so fantasticaly in his movies, then there would be no aaBridge.  What would be the point of a Bridge Movie player without such quality movies to play?


I once had a fear, that in the many years to come, these wonderful Bridge Movies would be forgotten due to the lack of a player to play them.  This collection included inside aaBridge is my attempt to get them to survive into the deep future.

I will never know if this stratergy is successful, but if you are reading this in 40 or 50 years time then you will know.
