^b@2To get back here quickly @- click the|fp|3|at| ^*nHome^*n |fp||at|button, far top left.  That will take you back to the Welcome page
^cthen click the|fp|2|at|   ^*bFlow >^*n   |fp||at|button to get you back here.    |cp|7|at|^*bPlease try this now^*n|cp||at|.


You are playing a |cp|2|fp|3|at|^*bTutorial |fp|2|cp||at|Bridge Movie |fp||cp||at|   (there is a second style of ^*bBridge Movie^*n that just has |fp|3|cp|2|at|^*bDeals|cp||fp||at|). This ^*bTutorial Bridge Movie^*n  (which is stored as a .lin file)  is embedded inside the ^*baaBridge^*n app.

You can see the location and name of this tutorial by looking at the very top, outer border, of this app's window.  The name is also displayed in the tall gray bar on the left and is highlighted by its own white box.


^c@|fp|3|cp||at| ^*bQ.^*n|cp||fp||at|  What does one |fp|2|cp||at|^*bdo^*n|cp||fp||at| in a  |cp|2|fp|3|at|^*bTutorial |fp|2|cp||at|Bridge Movie ?|fp||cp||at|

^c|fp|3|cp|7|at| ^*bA.^*n|cp||fp||at|  ^*bPlay it^*n by using your  |fp|2|cp|7|at|^*bMouse Wheel^*n|cp||fp||at|  or by clicking on the  |fp|3|cp|7|at|^*bFlow > |cp||fp||at| (or ^*bStep >^*n) button.


To discover the difference between the two buttons, hover your mouse over each and read the pop-up text.
^c^*bAll buttons^*n  in  ^*baaBridge^*n  have their own pop-up text.       |cp|7|at|^*bPlease try this now^*n|cp||at|.

You can also jump around in any tutorial by using the  ^*bNavigation Bar^*n  (explained later). 

^b@2|cp|7|fp||at|^*bNote^*n|cp||at| - Many of the tutorials collected here contain old instructions that tell you to click the  ^*bforward arrow^*n.
^dPlease @- ignore these and instead use  ^*bFlow >^*n,  ^*bStep >^*n  and the  ^*bNavigation Bar^*n.


^b@2Click     ^*bFlow >^*n      to move to the next page.        |cp|5|at|^*iPlease do this when you have read to the end of future pages^*n|cp||at|

^b@2When you are not in a tutorial you will be |fp|3|cp|2|at|^*bin a Deal|cp||fp||at|^*n.  You can always tell when you are ^*bin a Deal^*n  because the navigation bar, bottom of the screen (below the Step and Flow buttons), shows the words |fp|2|cp||at| ^*bBid  Play    Fin^*n|cp||fp||at|.

^c@2@.   In both modes you will often see a deal of four bridge hands on the screen, that is  |fp|3|cp||at|^*bnot|cp||fp||at|  the difference.

^b@2When you are |cs|3|fp|3|cp|2|at|^*bin a Deal|cp||fp||at|^*n you are the one in charge.  There is no tutorial author controling what you will see next.   Mostly you will enter a deal from a tutorial by using the { ^*bEnter the Deal^*n } button. You can then choose to use
the { ^*bEdit^*n }  { ^*bPlay^*n }  { ^*bReview^*n }  buttons (to the left of the deal) as you so wish.

It is most common to review the deal, stepping through it by clicking ^*bFlow >^*n.  That is why Review is the default state when you first, Enter a Deal.  

A key use of the ^*bReview^*n feature is to be able to step through the play of a hand in a tutorial and so study it  ^*bbefore^*n  all the information in the tutorial gives too much away.   

Using the ^*bSeat Options^*n (right hand panel) you can control exactly which hand you see.  Declarer, LHO or RHO.  This is a great way to practice your Defense Counting.  For a quick  - How To -  on this subject

^cLook in the tall gray column on the left  and click on   |cs||at|{ ^*bDefend Expert^*n }|cs|3|at|   (near the bottom of the list).

The { ^*bEdit^*n } & { ^*bPlay^*n } buttons are for you to investigate, you can always |cp|7|at|^*bhover your mouse^*n|cp||at| over the (real) buttons.

^*bHint^*n  -  you can use Edit to  'play'  all four hands and so see the  'cards in action'  on alternative lines of play.


The next tutorial covers the different parts of the aaBridge screen layout.
