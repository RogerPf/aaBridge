^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A diamond is fine as an opening lead. But there are 2 problems with the earlier choice of the @D7. Normally you do not lead away from aces in a suit contract. So Ruth should lead the @DA should she choose to lead a diamond. |
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general the lead of an unprotected ace (ace without the king) should be avoided. On the other hand, leading an ace when it is partner's suit can be ok. Therefore, Ruth should lead the @DA. As you already know you can lead away from an ace in NT. If we were in NT contract, the correct lead from A J 10 is the Jack or the 10 if playing coded 10s.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The play was straight forward and no comments are needed. I have one other comment on the bidding. Some experts play the 3S bid is just competing. It is not a game try. To make a game try East would bid 3@H. In that auction it says nothing about hearts. It simply says East is inviting to 4@S. Therefore, if you play 3@S is just competing, then your only game try is 3@H which is completely artificial in that particular auction. It is a common treatment with experts.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is an interesting hand for North to bid. South must have 3 cards in 1 major at least. Therefore, North knows for sure there is at least one 8-card fit. With 5/5 in majors responder should not bid Stayman. Because if notrumper did not have a 4-card major an bids 2@D, you will have to guess which suit to bid next.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The correct way to bid the hand with 5/5 in majors is first transfer to spades by bidding 2@H.|

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Then after the expected 2@S by notrumper, bid 3@H with invitational hand or 4@H with forcing hand—with this hand for example.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@H by North gives me choices for bids. With 3 hearts I pass and with 3 spades I bid 4@S. Of course I cannot have doubleton in both hearts and spades -:).|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


mb|4S|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With an invitational hand North would bid 3@H after my forced 2@S bid. After the 3@H bid again I have  several choices. I could pass 3@H, correct to 3@S with a minimum NT or I could bid 4@H or 4@S with a maximum NT.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If partner bids 2D, you jump in your 5-card major (I will get to Smolen in a minute). So with 5 spades and 4 hearts and a game force, for example you bid 3@S. For example:|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people play a convention known as Smolen, which I do not particularly recommend. If you play Smolen, then you would jump in your 4 card major. For example, 1N-2C-2D-3S, with Smolen, shows 5 hearts and 4 spades. The justification is that way, the NT bidder can bid 4H with 3 hearts and be declarer. The argument being it is better for the strong hand to be hidden. Having the strong hand as declarer is over rated. It often makes no difference.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think it is easy to forget Smolen and I recommend against playing it. But is is up to you. I will bet if you play Smolen you will have a bidding misunderstanding or two.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nicely done Kim. Let's talk about the play first. Normally I recommend against leading a suit the opponents have bid. But with such nice diamonds, I would have made the same lead as east did.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|After trick 1 Kim has 9 easy tricks. 4 clubs, 1 diamond (2 diamonds if first diamond is won at trick one in the North hand), 2 spades, and 2 hearts. So she did well to go after clubs first and then could knock out the @HK.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One point on the bidding. As many of you know I would open Ruth's hand 2@S. I do not subscribe to the theory that you should not have an outside 4-card major—many do.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, had she opened 2@S we probably still get to 3N. but Jacquie leads a spade and 3N goes down. I know many of you are worried about being vulnerable but it is very difficult for the opponents to double you. |
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Remember, first of all a double is takeout which means the partner of the doubler has to pass the takeout double to convert it to penalty double. And if they do, they may be doubling you into game, which is risky.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss the bidding first. 3C is ok, but here is a rule you might want to consider when preempting if partner is an un-passed hand, and you have a long suit headed by AKQ. That is very powerful, because it could easily be running with no losers. |
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, you might just make a simple overcall when partner has not passed because you could easily miss game. However, had Ruth passed then 3C would be a good tactic.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ruth made a very nice 4@S bid. Even if Kim has nothing, she would have to be unlucky to lose more than 2 hearts and 1 club. Slam makes because of Kim's singleton heart. But it is extremely hard to bid it.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) opened the BIL on  September 3, 2003 to provide the learner bridge player with a secluded place to attend lessons , mentoring sessions  and hosted practice sessions free from interruptions by the advanced bridge player.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals. In this presentation, in many instances again to enhance its teaching, they are presented in a closed format similar to as you experience at a bridge table. Some may not like this feature and prefer an open format. A ^*Ione^*N left click on the seat will open that hand, if closed, and a ^*Itwo^*n left click will open all four hands. You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|8|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
