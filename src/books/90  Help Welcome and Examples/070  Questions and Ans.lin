^b@2^*bQ.^*n   When I click on an External link to a lin file, like this one  ^*h http://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/downloadlin.php?filename=endplays.lin^*n Hondo717 - Endplays 1^*x.  It opens in aaBridge.
^e That's great, but I want to look at the .lin file.  Where will I find it ?

|cp|8|at|^*bA.^*n|cp||at|   On the  -  menu bar   >  File  >  Open 'autosaves' Folder    It will be in there.  Look for a long filename 
^e starting with a '1 ' and ending with the date and time of the download.
^e (Any files in the 'autosaves' folder that are more than 7 days old are deleted by aaBridge).
