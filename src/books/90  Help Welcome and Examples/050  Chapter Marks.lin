In the top left hand corner of the full aaBridge window you will see the  { ^*bHome^*n }  button.   Next to it are two buttons, labelled  { ^*bMenu^*n }   and  { ^*bTog Chapter Mark^*n }.
@1
The ^*bTog^*n or 'toggle' button will put a 'Chapter Mark' at the current position in that Chapter (= Lin file, Bridge Movie).

|cp|7|at|^*bClick^*n|cp||at| on { ^*bTog Chapter Mark^*n } to see the mark appear on the  ^*bNavbar^*n.
^mA |cp|4|at|^*bsecond click^*n|cp||at|  (if you are at the same spot) will remove it.


^*bChapter Marks^*n show you, by their appearance, whether you are  before,  ahead of  or  'ON'  them.

If you hold down the  ^*bCtrl^*n  key when clicking on a  Marked Chapter Entry  |cp|7|at|^*ball that chapter's marks will be cleared^*n|cp||at|.

Chapters with Chapter Marks  show a  |cp|4|at|^*blight blue vertical bar^*n|cp||at|   at the end of their name in the far left-hand panel.



The  { ^*bMenu^*n }  button shows a list of  ^*bmarked chapters^*n.   Click on one of them to open that chapter at the first Mark.

Of course, as you can at any time click anywhere in the  Navbar,  jumping to any other  'Chapter Marks'  is easy.



The previous chapter's   "Navigation bar"  is a good place to try out  Chapter Marks.   |cp|7|at|^*bPlease try them out now.^*n|cp||

You can add  Chapter Marks  to external files, ones you have 'dragged and dropped'  (or  windows  double-clicked)

BUT if you later  |cp|7|at|^*bmove the file^*n|cp||at|  the menu entry will  |cp|7|at|^*bbreak^*n|cp||at|  and so not work.





|fp|1|at|Book Panel goes white|fp||at|

If you see the  area where the list of chapters are displayed  'go white'  then list tells you that the link is now broken  (you have moved the file)  best to remove the entry, see previous page, (or put the file back).

Just click or move the mouse to return to the normal display.|
