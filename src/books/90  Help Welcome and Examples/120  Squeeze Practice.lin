ht|f|at|On the aaBridge  ^*bWelcome^*n  page is a button marked   ^*bPlay Bridge and show Deal Choices^*n   click that.

    ( You can have two copies of  ^*baaBridge^*n  open at once  -  one reading this, the other following along. )
	
In the right hand column the  ^*bNew Deals^*n  tab will now be showing.  

Click on the final radio button    -       33+  7NT  HARDEST

Next click the   { ^*bNew Board^*n }   button  center left.  

You will often have only 12 top tricks.   Squeeze possibilities will frequently provide the 13th. 

The  small slam  options,  which can generate trump contracts,  can also be used in this way.

|cp|5|at|^*baaBridge^*n  has a couple of built in tutorials on squeezes.   See : |cp||at|   

^d Menu bar           ^g ^*b Books ^*n    >    Watsons  -  Play of the Hand             >    Part 2 - 7

One  on-line  starting point is   ^*h http://squeeze-analysis.blogspot.co.uk/2005/06/introduction.html ^*n

Back in the 80's Terence Reese produced a series of books on Squeeze Play.  Many can be found  2nd hand  you really want the  ^*bSimple Squeeze^*n  book  before any of the others.

Your motto really needs to be  ^*bLearn the simple squeezes^*n  first.   |
