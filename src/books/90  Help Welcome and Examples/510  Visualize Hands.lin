at|^^Taking  South  as the master hand we have  4  losers   2@s(s)   0@h   0@d   2@c(f)   we need to reduce this to 3.
We cannot stop the  @c  losers so we will have to bring the  @s suit in for only one loser.  |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


at|If the  @s's split 3-3 (33%) we can give up an early spade trumps and later draw trumps.  But we have one chance where the trumps are 3-2 and where @s's are 4-2.  That is, if the Opp with the 3 trumps ALSO has to follow to the 4th round of Spades.  We can ruff that round of spades with a low trump in dummy,  so we have to  KEEP  a low trump in dummy.|

at|This hand is part of the |fp|t-title|at| Visualize example|fp||at|,  so please try the following approach.
  @2@.  Read through the order of play given on the next page.
@.  Try to Visualize (closing your eyes if it helps) how the North-South hands will look after the first couple of tricks.
@.  Play forward those two tricks - were you right ?    If not try again.
@.  Repeat the above going forward more and more tricks.
@.  The idea is to get you to practice trying to see what a hand will look like, if you play in a certain way.|

at|^*bAnswer^*n.|
at|     So the order of play needs to go.
Lose the two @c tricks.  Ruff the 3rd @c.  Duck a @s (the trumps in dummy will stop another @c coming back).   Win the return.  Play off dummy's two top trumps. (Assuming both Opps follow to the @h's).  Cash the @dA.   Cash the @sK and lead a low @s to the Ace.  If both Opps again follow @s's were 3-3 so draw the last trump and claim.
If one opp shows out but does not ruff then lead your last spade and ruff with the @h6 in dummy.
? The last two cards in your hand and the last two cards in dummy will be ?     Try to bring them to mind.|

Well done you have got to the end.   But there is more.       
Use the { ^*b Enter the Deal ^*n } and walk through the hand again.  This time you have the  { ^*b Show ^*n }  button to also do the same and try to visualize E-W hands as well.    Your target, is to be able to write all down from memory.  Enjoy.|
