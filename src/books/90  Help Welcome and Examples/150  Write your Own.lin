Should you ever wish to write your own lin files to run on aaBridge or any other lin file player then it is at heart simple.  Lin files are just ordinary text files.  


There is a   Comprehensive Tutorial   and a   How To   contained in this very application.  


From the meunbar above select  |cp|8|fp|3|at|^*b^*uB^*n^*books^*n|fp||cp||at|  and have a look at @-

^d@.^e^*bHow to              Make a Book^*n

^d@.^e^*bWhat goes on   Inside a Lin File^*n


	
These two, are all you need to write your own  .lin  files  and  (should you wish to) even your own  aaBridge.jar  all without any programming.
