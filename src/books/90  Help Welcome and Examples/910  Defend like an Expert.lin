^*bCount the hand^*n      -   work out which  'hand shape'  (such as  3-3-5-2)   declarer started with.

^*bCount the points^*n   -   work out how many points declarer has left and what cards they are likely to be.

^*bHave insight^*n       -   combine the two counts to show you how to 'see' the hand double dummy.


^cThat is what experts do, they get to the point where they can place every important card.  Bridge is then easy.
