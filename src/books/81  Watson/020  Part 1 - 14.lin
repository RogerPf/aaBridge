nt||HT|e|at|^B@2^Y@3In the preceding Chapter very brief mention was made of the fact that there are many hands which make the postponement of the trump lead more advantageous than the immediate drawing of the adverse trumps. There are, as a matter of fact, a fairly large number of trump plays in which the postponement of the trump lead is a prominent factor.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

The most common situation which calls for the postponement of drawing trumps is the hand which contains losers that at all costs must be discarded before the Opponents regain the lead. Sometimes the Declarer can draw trumps anyway, but when the adverse trumps include a high one which cannot be surely captured, he must wait until he has taken the discards necessary to salvage those losers. This mode of play may risk the loss of a trick, but more often than not it actually shows a profit. The following deal illustrates this play.|

Before playing another card, you must probe the possibilities of the hand as they now present themselves.

Surely there are no heart losers in this hand. |

You can ruff your worthless hearts with Dummy's trumps. What is more, you need not postpone the trump lead on this account, for Dummy has plenty of ruffing power to take care of the hearts later. However, you cannot stop here. You must also look at diamonds and clubs.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You have 3 sure club tricks. But your hand contains a losing diamond, and there will certainly be no possibility of ruffing it. If you lead trumps at once, the Opponents will take their trump Ace, and return a diamond. In this way they will take 2 tricks, for you can do nothing to prevent them from winning that second round of diamonds—unless you can discard one. You have the three top clubs.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You cannot follow suit from your hand on the third round of clubs, but, if neither Opponent has less than three clubs, you can throw off your losing diamond on that third round. |

Even if one Opponent has only two clubs, and ruffs the third round, it will do no harm to try this way of playing the hand, for you will still have discarded your losing diamond and will lose no more than 2 tricks in the entire deal no matter what happens.|

With the same opening lead as before (diamond King), you win with your Ace and lead three rounds of clubs. (Declarer's and Dummy's hands are just like those in the preceding example.) On the third round of clubs, you discard your diamond in exactly the same way as you did before,|pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d4|

If you had held the Ace instead of the Jack of spades it would have been the height of folly for you to have led clubs first. You should then simply lead spades until the adverse trumps are exhausted, using your clubs for any necessary discards later. ^*IOnly when the Opponents are sure of obtaining the lead on the first round of trumps, and are then sure of making a trick they could not take later, must you avail yourself of this trump postponement play.^*N|

^-{    POSTPONING THE TRUMP LEAD FOR A SPECIFIC DISCARD    }
^-|cp||FP||AT|^B@2^Y@3You cannot simply make up your mind that you need to discard a loser, and then discard any small card at all. Very often it makes a vast difference if you discard, say, a diamond instead of a club when you have a choice. Consider, for example, the following deal:|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT||
pn|You,,,|st||SK|S|md|1SKJT72HA62DA7CA92,S54HQJT4D652CKJ83,SQ983H753DKQ94C76,SA6HK98DJT83CQT54|RH||AH|Board 3|mb|4sppp|pc|hQ|NT|^B@2

PG| ***** 38 ***** |


AT|
You win with your Ace,|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hA|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


AT| and, glancing hurriedly at the trump situation, you see that you have the Ace to lose. Looking at your hearts, you see that each hand has 2 losers. Turning to your diamonds, you perceive 3 positive tricks and one round of diamonds from  Dummy available for a discard from your own hand. You have 1 losing trick in clubs, but the third round can be ruffed in Dummy.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The question is, should you lead trumps at the second trick? If you do, the Opponents will obtain the lead and will probably cash in 2 heart tricks promptly. But this does not take away your discard on the diamond suit, for you still have a losing club you would like to get rid of. Why not lead trumps, then, and, after the Opponents have taken 3 tricks, use the third round of diamonds to discard a club?|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This reasoning is wholly fallacious. What earthly good would a club discard be? You would have left two clubs in each hand, and only one round controlled (by the Ace). That is, you would still have to lose the second round of clubs in spite of your club discard. You would no longer have to ruff the ^*Ithird^*N round in the Dummy, but how does that help?|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
The discard of a club is purposeless. But the ^*Iimmediate^*N discard of a heart is imperative. The heart is a sure loser, while the club (the one you contemplated discarding) is not a loser at all. Conclusion: You cannot lead trumps at once, but you must take three rounds of diamonds in order to get rid of a heart. The play, then, proceeds as follows:|

The purpose of East's lead, since he saw the odd diamond left in Dummy's hand, was the hope that West could over-ruff whatever spade South played to the trick. However, since the Declarer held a solid sequence from the King down to the seven-spot, the seven was as good as the King for ruffing.|

^-{    ANOTHER WAY OF TAKING DISCARDS BEFORE LEADING TRUMPS    }
^-|CP||FP||AT|^B@2^Y@3I|FP||AT|n the preceding deal, discards were secured by leading out high cards in the suit which was to offer the discarding opportunity. Sometimes, however, the suit on which 1 or more losing tricks are to be discarded must first be established. A high card must be driven out of the Opponents' hands. The situation can usually be properly appraised by considering the time element of leads and realizing what may happen if you thoughtlessly present the lead to an Opponent. In the following deal it will take but one lead of trumps by South to send his four spade contract down the river.|

lb|*CWhich card would you play if you were the Declarer?^^hJ^SQJT98HJ2CA2DKQ4|sk||AT| You can, of course, lead your top trump with the idea of drawing trumps and losing 2 tricks immediately (spade Ace-King), but the Opponents will then continue the club suit to drive out your other stopper. They will thus chalk up against you 2 trump tricks, 1 club trick (the third round, for which the second trick in trumps provides them an entry), and 1 heart trick (Ace)—defeating your contract by 1 trick.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT|^B@2
There is only one way you can save yourself. You must establish a trick somewhere on which you can quickly throw off that losing third club. The only suit that seems likely (to be useful for discarding, a suit must be shorter in one hand than in the other) is hearts. The fact that you have only five hearts is encouraging, for your shortness reduces the risk of an adverse ruff on the third round. At the second trick, then, you must lead the Jack of hearts and continue the suit if the Opponents do not take their Ace promptly.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT|
^B@2 Whether the heart Ace is cashed in immediately or not makes no difference. The point is that you want to utilize the long (third) heart in Dummy's hand for getting rid of a club from your own hand. You can then draw trumps with perfect equanimity, knowing that the Opponents can win no more than 3 tricks altogether. Note that the heart suit is the one to lead—not the diamond. You have 3 sure diamond tricks, but with the equal diamond length in both hands you develop no discarding opportunity and, furthermore, you run great risk of an adverse ruff on the third round. |
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT|
^B@2As already stated, a suit is useless for discarding purposes unless its length is greater in one hand than in the other. The greater length need not be in the Dummy—it can be in either hand. Discards can be made from Dummy on long cards in Declarer's hand, for the purpose of developing 1 or more ruffing-tricks, just as efficaciously as discards have been made (in preceding examples) from Declarer's hand on Dummy's long cards.|

The Dummy has the Ace and one heart; Declarer has three hearts to the King-Queen. Clearly, then, the play is for South to take three rounds of hearts before leading trumps, discarding one of Dummy's diamonds on the third round. Trumps can then be drawn, and the Opponents will have to be satisfied with only 1 diamond trick—for South subsequently ruffs the other diamond loser in the Dummy.|

{    Summary    }
^-|CS||CP||FP||AT|^B@2^Y@3The general principles set forth in this Chapter may be concisely stated—to refresh and intensify the memory—as follows:|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


FP||AT|

- Whenever the Declarer must discard 1 or more losers before the Opponents  have a chance to lead the losing suit, he should postpone leading trumps—if by leading trumps he will permit the Opponents to regain the lead.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


AT|

- The necessity of postponing the trump lead in order to first discard a loser arises from the fact that to lead trumps will give the Opponents an opportunity to lead the suit containing Declarer's loser.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


AT|

- Drawing trumps must also be postponed when, to afford a discard, a side suit must be established. Here the process of establishing the side suit necessarily gives the Opponents one or more leads, and to give them the additional lead assured by an adverse controlling card in the trump suit will prove fatal. By first establishing the side suit, particularly when the suit containing the loser has two stoppers, Declarer is able to find the necessary discard before drawing trumps, always provided, of course, he does not run into any  distributional snag—which, in any event, he cannot help.|
