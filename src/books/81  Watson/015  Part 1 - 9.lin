qx|9B01,THE STRATEGY OF CONTROL AND THE HOLD-UP|
ht|e|fp||at|^B@2^Y@3Having gone through a necessary amount of groundwork in suit establishment, you are now ready to return to a subject which was but touched upon in the first chapter, namely, the control of a suit.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

In the handling of no-trump hands, which permits of considerable flexibility, you have learned that it is important to establish a suit netting you a profitable number of tricks before leading out your good cards without any purpose in view. So far, however, you have not been confronted with a hand in which you have been unable to retain control of the adverse suit which might be established against you. To make the preliminary explanation simpler, you were deliberately given example hands in which a suit was attacked by the Opponents, but in which you were also provided with adequate defensive units to circumvent the attack.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|

Unfortunately, in playing Contract Bridge you will have to handle whatever cards fate deals out to you, and you can by no means expect to have double control cards in every suit in the majority of hands you will get. Very frequently you will find yourself with but one defensive time unit in one of your suits, and you will be annoyed when your Opponents are usually discerning enough to choose that suit for their immediate attack!|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|

Naturally, if you have but one defensive unit against them, the Opponents will ultimately establish their suit in spite of everything you can do, especially if they keep on leading it. |
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


cs|1|fp|2|CP|4|AT|

^-{
 You can minimize the danger to some extent by keeping the Opponents from getting the lead. 
If you cannot keep both Opponents out of the lead,
you can try to confine the lead to one Opponent
and hope that he is the one who does not hold the established cards in the suit you fear.

HT|E|FP||AT|^B@2^Y@3It may usually be taken for granted that the player who opens a suit (that is, the player who first leads that suit) is the one who holds the greater length in it. Later you will have to remember that this rule is not invariable, but just now let us assume that it is always true. Your object will then be to hold on to your controlling card in that suit until there is a fairly good chance that the Opponent who is not leading the suit will be exhausted of it. Then, if you have to give up the lead, you will try to let that Opponent have it who quite probably has no cards left of his partner's suit to lead to him. This sort of play is called, in Bridge language, |CP|8|FP|2|AT|the hold-up|CP||FP||AT|, because you refuse to play ("hold up") the controlling card until you have to play it. The following deal illustrates the successful use of the hold-up:|

PG| ***** 11 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The weakest point in your armor is being attacked: your club Ace is your only stopper (controlling card) in that suit, but you have two or more controlling cards in each of the other suits. You cannot afford to release the Ace of clubs immediately, for you do not have enough high cards to make your contract in the teeth of an established club suit against you. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The moment you lose the lead, when your club Ace is gone, the Opponents will cash in you have no idea how many club tricks (at the worst, as many as 6). Meanwhile you earnestly desire to set up some diamond tricks on your own behalf, and you can do this by forcing out the adverse Ace.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But you cannot take your club Ace and then let an adversary take his diamond Ace, for he will surely come right back with a club. If the clubs are divided 4-2 (there are six outstanding), the Opponents will then make 4 club tricks and 1 diamond trick—enough to set your contract.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Though it is true that if the adverse clubs were originally split 4-4, the loss of 3 club tricks and 1 diamond trick will not defeat your contract, you have no right to expect such a favorable break in the club suit. |
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The fact that West has opened the suit suggests that he has fair length in it, probably five cards. Indeed, if West has five clubs, and his partner the other three, there is a way you can nip the plans of your Opponent in the bud. You have only to refuse to win the first two rounds of clubs, holding up your Ace until the third round. |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


NT|^B@2
By doing this, you wait until East is exhausted of clubs before you release control, so that, if East also has the diamond Ace, he will not be able to lead a club to his partner when he gets the lead with that sure winner. In fact, if East has no clubs at that time, he will have to lead a suit in which you have the controlling cards.|

Whichever Opponent wins, the suit is continued. Now East has to play his last club, and you have to play your Ace. On this third round, incidentally, you discard a heart from Dummy's hand. You have to make some discard, since Dummy has no more clubs, and you must retain as many diamonds as possible. Since you can take at the most only 2 heart tricks the discard of a heart is indicated.|

Even if East has another club, his partner has one also, so that the loss of a club trick cannot defeat your contract. As it happens, East has no more clubs, and must lead a spade, a heart, or a diamond. Whichever of these suits East chooses, you can claim the balance of the tricks.|

The hold-up is one of the simplest bits of strategy in the play of any hand, but it is also one of the most important plays in any good player's repertoire. |
PG| ***** 32 ***** |

There is a strangely prevailing opinion among average players that the use of the hold-up is confined to Aces. Actually the play can be used with cards as low as the Jack.|

One more example of the hold-up is not out of place here. Follow it through carefully so that you will surely be able to recognize the play whenever it comes up in your own experience at the card table:|

Really, you have less reason to be afraid on this hand than on the preceding one, for you are worried about the location of only one card, the diamond King. If West holds it, you can finesse against it successfully. If East holds it, the chances are better than even that East held originally three clubs at the most. If this is so, the hold-up will prevent any established clubs from winning.|

T|FP||AT|he ^*Ihold-up^*N is not the proper play when you hold more than 1 potential trick in that suit. In the two examples just given, the hold-up was effective because you held only one possible stopper in the suit attacked by the Opponents. Sometimes the suit opened against you is one in which you hold the Ace accompanied by certain lower cards which can be developed if you do not employ the hold-up, but which will be valueless if you hold up the Ace. This fact is due to the promotional value of honors.|

To hold up will, as it happens, cost you a trick. By retaining the Jack in the Dummy and the Ten plus a small card in your own hand, you hold two cards which can be beaten only by the King. This means that one of your two cards must win a trick. You ultimately establish your diamonds in this hand and come out at the end of the play with 11 tricks piled up for your side.|

By capturing the Jack you promote your Ten, nine, and eight to a higher rank in the suit. Since you hold two of these cards guarded in one hand, you can successfully withstand the further bombardment in the suit which will occur when the Opponents play their King and Queen.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


cp||NT|^B@2
You should be able to perceive immediately that this situation does not call for the hold-up. If you hold one less spade in your own hand, well and good—hold up your Ace then, because your Ten, nine, and eight will all fall together on the adverse King and Queen. Without an original holding of four spades you would not have a potential second spade stopper.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Having won the first round of spades, then, with your Ace, what do you do next? You probably see all sorts of finessing situations confronting you. You can finesse against the club Queen; if West holds this card, you will make 3 club tricks. You can also finesse against the heart Queen; if East holds this card, you will make 3 heart tricks. What can be gained by taking these finesses immediately? They will be available somewhat later, if you find it advisable to take them. |
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Your main object should be, instead, to try to establish certain winners before you do any fooling around with possible winners. After all, good though a finesse may be in the proper time and place, it cannot compare with the certainty of developing tricks by establishing a suit along lines of play which are almost sure to succeed.|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


AT|

Look, for instance, at your diamond holding. If you concede 2 tricks to the Opponents for their Ace and King, you establish 3 tricks in the suit. |
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You must also lose the King and Queen of spades, and that will make 4 tricks for the Opponents. However, you are certain of winning the fourth round of spades, so that if the spades are divided adversely 4-3 you can lose no more than 2 spade tricks. Has the finessing possibility any advantage over developing diamonds? None. Indeed, even if both finesses succeed, they will not assure you of your contract, and it will still be necessary to attack the diamond suit. The best procedure is clearly to make the diamond attack without delay.|

The question came up, earlier in this chapter, whether Dummy should play a high or a low card on the opening lead coming from Declarer's left. The statement was made that it was inadvisable to play a high card when there was no good reason for doing so. This statement requires elucidation. The contract is still no-trump, and spades are opened against you by West on the first lead. Say, the four of spades is the actual opening lead.

That is, you may as well play it at once, and gain whatever advantage you can from it. In the second situation, if you play a low card you still leave the Queen guarded, and consequently the Queen may win later.|

What is more pertinent, if East does not have the Ace, the Queen will hold the trick, leaving you with secondary control of the suit (your guarded King).

You pursue these tactics, of course, to protect your King from a fatal lead by East up to West's Ace.|

Though it is too early to bring up the subject of defensive play, it may be mentioned here (to forestall any criticism by some alert reader) that East could defeat your contract on this hand by good play in spite of your hold-up in hearts. He needs only to switch from hearts to clubs at the second trick. In other words, he abandons trying to establish his partner's suit and seeks to set up a suit of his own.

{    Rules 11 and 7 by Howard Schutzman    }
^-|CP||FP||AT|^B@2^z@3I|FP||AT|f the opponents play 4th best leads, you can often determine the distribution of the suit from the opening lead. The easiest case is when an opponent leads the 2, in which case, he must have a 4 card suit, since he has no lower cards. Similarly, if he leads a higher card, and you can see all the lower cards between you and dummy (for example, he leads the 5, and you can see the 4, 3, and 2), then he also has a 4 card suit. How does that help you? Well, if the opponents have 8 cards in the suit led, you know they are divided 4-4, so if you have a single stopper, there is no gain in holding up. Even if you cannot see all the cards below the suit led, you can often determine how the suit is divided. For example, if you are missing just one lower card in the suit led, the opponent has at most a 5 card suit, and if the other player plays that lower card, then you know the leader started with 4 cards in the suit.|
PG| ***** 216 ***** |


AT|

A rule that is sometimes useful when the opponents lead 4th best is known as the "|CP|8|FP|2|AT|Rule of 11|FP||CP||AT|". Let me explain the math behind it first. Given any card in a suit, because there are 13 cards in that suit, if you subtract the number of that card from 14, that tells you how many cards there are that are higher than that card. For example, with an 8, there are six higher cards (14 - 8 = 6), the A, K, Q, J, 10, and 9. Now if an opponent plays 4th best, you know he has 3 cards higher than the card led. Therefore, you can do some simple math to figure out how many higher cards are in the other 3 hands — 14 - 3 (number of higher in leader's hand) - the number of the card led. Since 14 -3 is always 11, if you subtract the number of the card led from 11, you can figure out how many higher cards there are in the remaining 3 hands.|
PG| ***** 217 ***** |


AT|

How can you apply that rule? Say, for example, your opponent leads the 8, and you know it is 4th best. Remember, I said there are six cards higher than the 8. The leader has 3 of them, and therefore the other 3 hands have the other 3 (and, indeed, 11 - 8 = 3). If between you and dummy, you have 3 cards higher than the 8, then the leader's partner has no cards higher than the 8. Similarly, if you and dummy have 2 cards higher than the 8, the leader's partner has one card higher. This information can often help you determine how the high cards are distributed, which increases the likelihood that you will play the suit to your best advantage.
