^B@2^Y@3Very little has happened that is startlingly new in the play of the hand since Louis Watson wrote this book in 1933 and 1934. True, play in general has improved because of the increased experience of hundreds of thousands of individual players as the popularity of Contract Bridge pyramided. Players have become better able to tie in the bidding with the play. We can, however, offer one widely used and valuable playing convention which cropped up a few years after Watson; and also one currently-up-in-the-air change in thinking on an old playing convention.

^-{    Suit-Preference Signals When Ruffing - Chapter XII    }
^-|
cp||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3During the late Thirties a good many players in a good many different localities began, more or less simultaneously, to experiment with a new form of defensive signal. (^*IAll^*N new conventions which are worth their salt, crop up that way. No one genius invents them, although frequently one expert does a lot of legwork and deservedly gets most of the credit. Excuse us, Messrs. Blackwood, Stayman, Gerber, Fishbein, et al.) |
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|

This new playing convention first got publicity through an article by a Mr. Hy Lavinthal; then B. Jay Becker gave it his worthy attention and efforts. It has become known variously as the Lavinthal convention, Becker convention and simply as Suit-Preference. Extensions of this convention beyond ruffing situations (explanation of which follows) should be looked upon solely as "exceptions proving the rule.”|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|

In brief: When leading to give your Partner a ruff, or in following suit to Partner’s ruffing trick, you can assist your Partner to choose a suit for his return lead, by the size of the card you play. The signal is simply described by the catch phrase "high-high, low-low."|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|

To explain: There are only two suits left after we eliminate the suit which is being ruffed and the trump suit. A high card played by you in leading or following suit on the trick Partner ruffs, tells your Partner you are prepared for him to continue with the ^*Ihigher^*N ranking of the two remaining suits. A ^*Ilow^*N card by you in the same situation tells Partner you prefer him to continue with the ^*Ilower^*N ranking of the two remaining suits. Let’s take a typical example:|

West, despite his horrible looking array of cards is a most active participant in this defense, proving one of Louis’ admonitions mentioned in a very early chapter. Having none of his Partner’s diamonds to lead, West guesses a low heart.|PC|h6|

NT|^B@2
At this point, before the days of Suit-Preference, West would be on the spot. Who has the missing low heart? If Declarer has it, West should lead that suit again for his Partner to ruff. Or, does East have the club Ace and Declarer only the King or vice versa, either being plausible on the bidding?|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But, playing Suit-Preference, West reads his Partner’s diamond nine as a low one, undoubtedly the lowest of some sequence. It can’t be East’s highest diamond or anything like it, on East’s vulnerable four diamond bid. So, since East is obviously leading as ^*Ilow^*N a diamond as he can afford (he must lead a high enough card to force a high card from Declarer) East must want clubs, the ^*Ilower^*N ranking "other" suit. (Hearts in this case is the higher ranking "other" suit.)|

^-{    Extension of Suit-Preference Signals - Chapter XII    }
^-|cp||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3We enter this subject with great fear and trepidation, because we have seen many players essay to scrap the entire normal sound structure of defensive play and replace it with Suit-Preference signals. Needless to say, these efforts have not been crowned with success, even with expert highly experienced partnerships.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


AT| 

Suit-Preference was designed basically for ruffing situations, as in the previous examples. In other normal situations a high card still means "Partner, please continue the suit," and a low card still means "shift" or at least "continue at your own risk."|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


AT|

Even when Dummy has a singleton, at a suit contract, the signaller may want Dummy’s trump holding shortened. Or perhaps the signaller’s holding in both of the other side suits is so bad that he wants at least to warn Partner against a dangerous shift. So Suit-Preference, like fire, is valuable when properly used and controlled, but highly dangerous if played with indiscriminately.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


AT|

The following example of a non-ruffing Suit-Preference signal is so clear cut that we feel safe in giving it. Don’t go much further than this!|

AT| On this particular deal, with this particular Dummy and, most important, on this particular bidding, there should be no confusion. This must be a Suit-Preference signal. East can’t want hearts continued as East must know and, furthermore, must know that West too must know, that the danger of a ruff-and-discard on a second heart bid is too great. In fact on East’s triple raise it should appear to West as just about a certainty.|pc|h3|

East is able, from the fall of the cards to the first two rounds of spades, to tell that his Partner has the spade eight and almost certainly, for that matter, the spade deuce also. Otherwise there is just no accounting for Declarer’s hold·ups. Why therefore did West carefully choose the Queen when the eight (or deuce) would have cleared the suit equally well.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |

The answer is that West is trying to say that his entry card is in a high ^*Ior^*N higher ranking suit.|PC|std2sa|

NT|^B@2
Without the signal a diamond lead up to relative weakness will seem much more logical than a heart lead up to Dummy’s King. But that will give the Declarer 9 tricks and his contract: one spade, five diamonds and three clubs.|

CS||CP||fp||AT|^B@2^Y@3The passing of time has brought one unanimous minor change from Louis’ writings on this subject and another more drastic change which has received only partial acceptance in expert circles. For the latter reason—because nothing is truly definitive—we will be brief in our discussion of this subject and tend to generalize. |
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


AT|

Keep two things in mind. That "never say never" adage applies doubly to the subject of which card to lead from a three card suit. If you and your Partner happen to agree to lead the lowest from ^*B9 7 2^*N, the bidding of the very next hand may give you good and sufficient reasons to prefer the nine that time. So never say never lead the nine or the seven or the deuce. The other thing to keep in mind, whatever method of leading you choose, is to be sure you and your Partner know what each other tends to do. |

Lead low from K x x, Q x x and J x x against either a suit bid or no-trump. (That J x x combination is the one definite swing away from Louis. He preferred the Jack but only slightly.)|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


AT| 

With 10 x x and x x x we have differences of opinion. The low card rather than the top card from both of these holdings in Partner’s bid suit is now preferred by most top players. (The middle card is preferred by no one.) If you and Partner agree to lead low from these worthless tripletons you have this corollary going for you: If you have raised the suit during the auction you will then lead the top card. Partner, because of your raise, still knows you have three.|

If you hold x x x against either a suit or no-trump contract, a sizeable block of experts votes for the low lead. We won’t give the arguments pro and con—they are too lengthy and get one almost into metaphysics. We personally have come around to preferring the low lead as a general thing, reserving the right to make many exceptions depending on exact hands and exact bidding. We believe Louis Watson would also belong to that school today. But either method is playable so long as it is not played woodenly and so long as Partner is let in on your secrets.  |

^-{    Delaying For a Squeeze - Chapter XIII    }
^-|
CS||FP||CP||AT|^B@2^Y@3WATSON’S earlier discussion of the squeeze in this book is famous for being far and away the most lucid explanation of that family of plays. Portions of his text have been paid the compliment of being copied just about verbatim by some of his fellow bridge writers in their tomes. So we feel a bit diffident about wanting to add anything to Watson on squeezes. |
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


AT|

But there’s one phase of the squeeze that Watson hinted at a single line in his end-of-Chapter summary but pretty much skipped over in the text. So we’re going to fill in that—to our mind—fairly large gap with two sample hands on the subject.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


AT|

"A squeeze is effective only when Declarer has sure tricks within one trick of the contract [he is squeezing to make]," Louis said. Thus, if you want to ^*Isqueeze^*N for twelve tricks you have to have 11 winners (barring the very rare progressive squeeze). But also you have to ^*Ihave lost 1^*N ^*Itrick^*N. If you want to squeeze for 10 tricks you have to have nine winners and have to have ^*Ilost 3 tricks^*N. And so on. Note the past tense of the word "lost." Your squeezes won't work if you’re ahead of yourself any more than if you’re behind schedule in winners.|

Here’s a typical delaying tactic to prepare for the squeeze. South has become the Declarer at six no-trump—the bidding is irrelevant—and West opens the club Queen.|MB|6nppp|PC|cq|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


at| Declarer sees that he has 11 sure tricks and 12 if the diamonds are 3-3. Since the club opening has taken away Declarer’s timing to try to work on the spade suit, his only possibility for 12 tricks other than the 3-3 diamond break is a possible squeeze.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If the diamonds break adversely, but the long diamond hand also has the King and Queen of spades—a not too remote possibility—that player can be squeezed out of one or the other. But neither Defender can be squeezed out of the 12th trick unless that point can be reached on schedule. The Defense must be given ^*I1^*N trick earlier or else there will be room in the Defender’s hand for both his spade and diamond guards.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The only way on this deal for Declarer to lose that 1 trick and prepare for his squeeze position is to let the club Queen ^*Ihold the opening lead^*N. Declarer, by winning the opening club and trying to lose that loser at any later point, will obviously expose himself to several losers. So by ducking the first club Declarer prepares his squeeze position and still keeps control with his club Ace.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We suggest you play out the hand carefully by yourselves and see the squeeze operate on West through the running of Dummy’s heart suit. South throws spades and keeps all four diamonds, with Dummy’s spade Jack operating as the other squeeze card. Then try it without ducking the first club and watch West get off the hook. |

Here’s another example of how Declarer can take delaying action to prepare a squeeze. South’s opening two no-trump bid is carried directly to six by North. West opens the club Jack.|PC|cj|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


at|  South counts 11 certain top tricks and 12 if either hearts or diamonds break 3-3. (He has 13 if both suits break, but that is of no consequence.) But if neither suit breaks, there is one extra chance for a 12th trick, and no good player will fail to try for it. If one opponent has four (or more) cards in both red suits, the old squeeze play can be put to work.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But again, to squeeze for 12 one must not only have 11 winners but must have lost 1 trick. To inspect this particular hand more closely, Declarer can only run 5 fast tricks, outside of the red suits in which he hopes to squeeze an Opponent. After cashing three clubs and two spades the Opponent—East in this case—will still have eight cards left, four in each red suit and thus not be squeezed. But if 6 tricks can be played first, bringing East down to only seven cards he’ll have to unguard one of the suits.|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So South hits on the one way he can delay and lose a trick to get his squeeze on the road. He can’t impair the squeeze suits themselves by giving up a heart or a diamond trick.|

CS||cp||FP||AT|^B@2^Y@3Chapter VIII of Part II included a discussion of the no-trump echo in which a Defender, in following suit with his low cards, gives his Partner a count on the suit by echoing (playing high-low) to show only two. This often enables Partner to know just how long to hold up a high card in the suit to destroy Declarer’s communications. The negative inference was also explained. Failure to echo would show three or more low cards in the suit.|

This very valuable echo has now been extended. (At just what point during the 24 year period the extension became widespread we cannot say—perhaps the early Forties.) The defending player following suit with his low cards echoes with either ^*Itwo or four^*N cards in the suit. This enables the Partner to get valuable information much more rapidly in many cases. Let’s look at this situation [Examples A and B].|

West then knows for certain that East does’t have exactly three cards in the suit. He does’t know for certain, as in Example A, whether East is showing two or four. But in either case he does’t really care [he can win his Ace on the second round with impunity)]. and this holds good in many other similar situations.|

Either way his action is clear cut: he (West) can win his Ace on the second round with impunity. If Partner has a doubleton [Example A, reloaded again] that gives Declarer four cards in the suit and Dummy the same number, so holding up the Ace till the third round will do no good.|

And, if, as in Example B [again reloaded and shown above], Partner’s echo is from a four card holding that leaves Declarer with only two. So again the Ace should be taken on the second round and this time it may prevent Declarer from even winning a second trick in the suit (if Dummy is entry less).|
PG| ***** 100 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In any event, it is most valuable in these situations to know that when Partner "goes up," that is, plays low and then high, that he has exactly three cards in the suit (or, rarely, five). |
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Sometimes a Defender can get the entire picture on the ^*Ifirst^*N round of the suit when the low card Partner plays is clearly the lowest one that he can have. He thus can’t be showing two or four and therefore must have either three or a singleton. The singleton possibility can usually be eliminated by simple deduction.|
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Incidentally, the title "no-trump echo" is somewhat of a misnomer. This type of signal is very frequently used to advantage in suit play as well, in the same type of situation. However, in suit play, the player with four small usually does’t echo as Partner may erroneously play him for two and try to give him a ruff. |
