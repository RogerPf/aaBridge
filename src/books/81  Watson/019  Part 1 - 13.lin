%% 13.1 RUFFING POWER 
qx|13B01,RUFFING POWER  |
nt||HT|d|at|^B@2^Y@3The principal difference between no-trump and suit play lies in the ruffing power of trumps at a suit contract. It is for this reason, of course, that all bidding systems give definite trick values to short or void suits in the hand supporting Partner's bid. A player who considers raising his Partner's suit bid does so with far more confidence when his hand contains even a doubleton, and more so still with a singleton or a void. The reason is that the Declarer, if he plays the hand at a suit contract, can eliminate the short suit from the Dummy and use Dummy's trumps for ruffing cards which would otherwise be certain losers. Thus the proper understanding of ruffing power becomes of extreme importance.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

It is as clear as daylight that to make full use of Dummy's small trumps the Declarer must keep them in Dummy's hand. In other words, if the Dummy contains a limited number of trumps, the Declarer cannot afford to remove  them immediately, even for the important purpose of drawing the Opponents' trumps. When the Dummy goes down on the table, and you see a singleton or a doubleton among your assets as Declarer, you must check at once that suit in your own hand in order to discover whether the shortness of the suit in the Dummy will be of any use to you. If you hold more cards in that suit than the Dummy, and some of these are clearly losers, you see at once that Dummy's shortness has a vital value. A very simple illustration will serve to clarify this:|

Movie Maker|cp||at|: Watson in his book has the example boards for the viewers to see the four hands. Here, to increase the teaching value I used the closed format where the viewer can see only the declarer and dummy's hands. I have placed his play of the hand instructions in the chat box. At the end of the play all hands are open and in most cases the viewer can play the hand double dummy. Further, at anytime the viewer can left click any of the seats and view that hand. Click that seat again and the other hands open. Now, let us look at the first example.

You see at a glance that you lack enough high cards to guarantee the success of the contract. However, you have other tricks available—those which may develop from ruffing, for spades are trumps. You hold three absolutely worthless hearts—but the Dummy has no hearts at all!|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


AT| What is more, the Dummy also has three trumps—just enough to ruff your losing hearts. Unless you are over-ruffed (that is, unless an Opponent plays a higher trump on one of these ruffing-tricks of yours), you can utilize every one of Dummy's trumps, provided you do not eliminate any of them in trying to draw the Opponents' trumps.|

Every time you made one of these ruffing plays, you may well have held your breath lest one of the Opponents be exhausted of hearts and play a higher trump. However, this mode of playing this hand is the only chance of making the contract, and the risk must be taken. With the last of the heart losers out of the way, you begin to perk up hopefully.|

The moment has come to draw trumps, for Dummy has none left to be sacrificed in this attack. You lead a low diamond from Dummy and trump in your own hand with the three of spades. (Note that the club King remains in Dummy as a re-entry for using the diamond King later.)|

This hand is very simple because of the fortuitous opening lead made by West. You were able to realize the value of your short suit (hearts) without delay. Very often, however, you will find it necessary to go to work and establish the value of your short suit  by your own efforts. In the example deal just given, one lead of trumps by an Opponent would have upset the apple cart as far as the success of your contract was concerned. |

The enemy would then have been able to keep your ruffing activities down to two hearts. To be sure, the Opponents had only one opportunity to lead (the opening lead), but a trump lead then would have been a catastrophe.|

Sometimes the Dummy is so long in trumps that the short suit need not be attacked first. Trumps can be drawn first of all without losing any ruffing power, which may be utilized later.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


AT|

This situation arises, usually, when the Dummy holds four trumps. Generally speaking, when the Dummy contains only three trumps, the drawing of trumps must be deferred until the Declarer has taken whatever he needs in ruffing-tricks. With four trumps in the Dummy, the Declarer may usually lead one round of trumps with complete safety. You must, of course, always notice how many losers you must dispose of in your hand, and how many trumps the Dummy has available for ruffing purposes.|

West's opening lead is a heart against your four spade contract. You win with your Ace. There is no escaping the fact that you must lose 1 heart trick some time, and that you must also ruff a heart in the Dummy. This does not require immediate attention, however. You require that only one trump be left in the Dummy, for your ruffing purposes, and consequently it will be well, first of all, to draw the adverse trumps.|

Not quite. This play would be almost as good, but it would lose one time unit. |
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


AT|

In the first place, it might result in failing to establish a sure trick immediately, because, if the Jack wins the first round, the Ace is left outstanding. Furthermore, it does not take into account the possibility of finding West with either the lone Jack or the Ace-Jack doubleton. If West should have either of those combinations, the lead of the trey from your hand exposes the weakness and ends all your worries about losing 2 diamond tricks.
|
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


AT|
Do you think it would be the same to lead low from Dummy and play the Queen on the first round? No, for if West wins with the Ace, you will no longer have any finessing position because the lead of the Ten on the third round will mean its certain covering by the Jack. This is the same as leading a lone Queen up to a lone Ace—if the Queen is covered, the finesse disappears. The situation remains unchanged if your Queen holds the trick on the first round, and you continue the suit—the Opponents must win 2 tricks.

If you decide that West has the Ace and East the Jack, you must lead from your own hand toward the King, finessing the Ten on the way back. If you decide, however, that East holds the Ace and West the Jack, you must lead low from the Dummy (North), go up with the Queen on the first round, and finesse the nine-spot on the way back. The fact that you hold four cards which are higher than all but two (Ace and Jack) of the Opponents' enables you to play the combination either way, because your fourth card gives you control of the last round if the Ace wins the first round and the Jack the second, or vice versa.

Having trumped with the Ace you can now lead the four-spot and draw all of the outstanding trumps. You then cash in your good spade tricks and simply concede two club tricks at the end.|

The ruffing with Dummy's Ace is far from a pointless play. Had you ruffed with the four-spot and then led the Ace to start drawing trumps, you would have found that the trump suit was blocked.|
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


AT| You would have been forced to try to return to your own hand by leading spades, and West would have trumped the second round of this suit and your contract would have been defeated by 1 trick. By unblocking the trump suit, which you did by ruffing with your Ace, you eliminated any chance of this happening.|

{    RUFFING POWER IS CONFINED TO THE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||CP||fp||AT|^B@2^Y@3I|FP||AT|n all the example deals in this chapter, you may have noticed that ruffing power appeared only in the Dummy's hand, never in the Declarer's hand. Though it may seem incredible, there is practically no such thing as a ruffing-trick to be found in the long trump hand, which is almost always the Declarer's hand. |

^*iSam Fry, Jr.:|cp||at| In those rare cases where the Dummy contains the greater length in trumps, the play is simply reversed^*N.
|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


AT|
The reason for this may be quickly explained. If the hand containing the greater number of trumps wishes to take tricks with them, he needs only to establish the trump suit. If he holds five trumps to the Ace-King, and his Partner holds four small ones, two rounds of the suit will probably catch all the adverse trumps, and the three trumps he has left in his own hand will all be high. |
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


AT|If now he leads some card from the Dummy and plays a trump on it from his hand, he is not making a ruffing-trick—he is, as a matter of fact, not gaining a trick at all. He could easily have accomplished the same result by leading the trump from his hand and discarding the card (which he led) from the Dummy. |
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


AT|

The high trumps in his own hand are good no matter how he plays them. Put this way, |cp|8|at|the lead of trumps for no reason at all, you see, gains nothing. Properly speaking, a ruffing-trick is a trump trick which cannot be made by leading trumps; it is always an extra trick, never an automatic trick.|cp||at||
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


AT|

This fact—|cp|8|at|that ruffing power is generally confined to the Dummy|cp||at|—is of importance because it crops up frequently in defensive play. It is a common failing among average players to take tricks quickly, as Declarers, with tricks in their own hands. Most of the time they do not realize that they are reducing their strength and weakening their position. |FP|2|
pg| ***** 136 ***** |


cp|8|at|The Declarer who takes out his own trumps immediately, under the delusion that he is making ruffing-tricks, is merely taking a few tricks early in the play with cards which he should be reserving as controls against later attacks.|cp||FP|

{    Summary    }
^-|CS||CP||fp||AT|^B@2^Y@3T|FP||AT|he general subject of this Chapter has been the utilization of ruffing power in the Dummy. Whenever necessary, the lead of trumps should be postponed until full and separate use has been made of Dummy's trumps in gaining ruffing-tricks.  This is true whether the Opponents lead your short suit or whether you find it  necessary to lead it yourself in order to get at the precious nucleus of ruffing profits. You should lead trumps before ruffing, of course, if the Dummy is long enough in trumps to withstand one or more trump leads without being drained of ruffing power.|

You learned about a new type of finesse, which came up incidentally—the finesse against Ace-Jack. To finesse when holding three honors (two in one hand and one in the other) you should first lead up to the single honor, keeping intact the tenace position with the double honors. This rule does not necessarily apply, however, when the three honors are supported by the next card in sequence below.|
PG| ***** 139 ***** |

Finally, you learned that you may sometimes find it necessary to unblock the trump suit by ruffing with a high trump instead of a low one.|

^-|CS||CP||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|At the end of the chapter, Watson talks about unnecessary ruffs. This is a common mistake that I see many less experienced players make. If, as declarer, you are out of a suit, but dummy still has cards remaining in that suit, there is no reason to ruff those cards out in your hand. In fact, as Watson points out, entering dummy so that you can lead a card to trump in your hand is no different than leading out a trump and discarding that card from dummy. |
PG| ***** 143 ***** |

And, there is sometimes a disadvantage in doing that, as it shortens your trumps, and may, in fact, make you run out of trumps prematurely, allowing the defenders to cash low cards that you otherwise would have been able to trump. If you have a good reason to do so, such as needing an entry to your hand, then you might want to ruff one of dummy's losers. Otherwise, it is bad technique to unnecessarily ruff dummy's low cards. |
PG| ***** 144 ***** |

By the way, this illustrates an important point about choice of contracts. In general, it is better to play in a 4-4 fit than a 5-3 fit. This is because you can use the 5 card suit to pitch losers from the other hand, and trump those losers. However, if you are in danger of losing control, then the presence of a 5th trump in one hand gives you an extra measure of protection. This should be given serious consideration when choosing your contract, particularly if you have a singleton or void in a side suit; in that case, having a long trump suit can be crucial in preventing you from losing control.|

"Having said all that, which most experts teach, I would like to alert you that it is safer to play in a 5-3 fit than a 4-4 fit. That is because almost 1/3 of the time, trumps do not break 3-2. If, for example, they break 4-1, then in a 4-4 fit one defender has as many trumps as you do. In a 5-3 fit, you still have more trumps. So, assuming you don't need the extra trick that a 4-4 fit sometimes yields, the 5-3 fit is better."^*N|

{    Counting Trump Tricks    }
^-|CS||CP||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is the method I use to count trump tricks. I count the number of trump tricks I have in the hand that has longer trumps. I then add to that the number of ruffs I will get in the other hand. |
PG| ***** 148 ***** |

Let me give a couple of examples. Suppose you hold AQ1086 opposite KJ97. You will score 5 trumps in your own hand. If dummy is out of a suit, and you can ruff in dummy twice, you will also score 2 ruffs in dummy. So the total number of trump tricks you will take is 7, the 5 trumps in your hand plus the 2 ruffs in dummy.    |
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


AT|

As another example, suppose you have KQJ109 opposite 543 and you only have the opportunity to ruff once in dummy. Your total number of trump tricks is 5, 4 in your hand (you have to lose the Ace) plus one ruff in dummy.	|
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


AT|

There is one slightly tricky situation which occurs on rare occasions. Let us look at the first example again, AQ1086 opposite KJ97. Suppose dummy is 4-3-3-3, so you cannot ruff anything in dummy. Well, then you might think you will only score 5 trump tricks. However, assume you have a void in a suit and dummy has 2 low cards in that suit. If you ruff both low cards in your hand, you will be reduced to 3 trumps and dummy will still have four. So, using my method for counting trump tricks, you have six trump tricks -- the 4 trump tricks in the "long" hand (dummy) plus the 2 ruffs in your hand.
