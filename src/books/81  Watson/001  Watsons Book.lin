The chapters are displayed in the dark grey bar on the left.   Clicking on a chapter name will jump you to it.

The  |cp|8|at|^*bNavigation Bar^*n|cp||at| is the cream and grey line, with bobbles on it, at the bottom of this window. Clicking anywhere on the bar will move you that point in the current chapter.

If you make a mental note of which chapter you are in and where (on the navigation bar) you have got to, then when you want resume reading it will only take a couple of clicks to get back to your place in the book.

The blue color links throughout the text are hyper-links. You can click on them to go to to the destination.  Some links take you to external sites.  Links that go to .lin files open in second instance of aaBridge. You can return back to Watson's Book via   |cp|8|fp|3|at|^*b^*uB^*n^*books^*n|fp||cp||at|  on the menubar above.

The   ^*bStep >^*n   and   ^*bFlow >^*n    buttons below are the normal way of moving forward, including going to the next chapter.  The only difference between them is that   ^*bFlow >^*n   displays card play, one card at a time; whereas  ^*bStep >^*n will show a whole trick, at once.

In places where a full deal is included in the presentation, you have the option of clicking on the  ^*bEnter the Deal^*n  button.  This will allow you to explore the deal, exactly as you can in the  ^*bPlay Bridge^*n  part of this program.

Downloaded lin files can be opened by  ^*b Drag n Drop ^*n  or by using        (menubar)   >   File  >   Open a Saved Deal

When you are in the   Play Bridge   section you can save and reload single deals.

From now on, please press   ^*bStep >^*n   or   ^*bFlow >^*n|
