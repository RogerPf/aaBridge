^b@2^*bRonald's Original^*n


On all the following pages is the original version of a lin file I got from the web. 

Written by a Dutch fellow called Ronald, it was the core without which I would never have started to write this the 'tutorial lin' version  of  ^*baaBridge^*n.

It not perfect and is of course, because of its age, aimed at the windows based lin file player that was developed by in the late 1990s into the early 2000s that is out on the web at time of writing.

As you will see ^*baaBridge^*n does not support every feature mentioned.  This lin file was accompanied by a word doc I will put a copy of that word doc in all the aaBridge jars that I produce. Of course it may not be in the one that final gets to you and has allowed you to read this.  Anyway @-


^fa big |cp|5|at|^*b thank you to Ronald^*n|cp||at|, where ever and who ever you are.

qx|oooo|

   qx[tekst] is used to divide your text in chapters. if you use it, then the book 
   with open leaves will be visible and will work.
bt||

    bt[] is the start of Bare Text. The table vieuw will almost all
    times with st[], Standard Text i have called that.

tu|1|

    tu[] will keep the mn[] header on the page after pg[] with tu[1], 
    tu[] will lose the header after pg[] default seems to be tu[]     
    tu[Y] and tu[1] have the same effect.
    
mn|^0examples of lin tags..every tag commented inside|

    mn[some text] puts a coloured header on top of page

nt||
    nt[with or without text] clears the text you entered with at[] or nt[]. 
    Only the mn[] part will survive. I think nt[] followed by at[] is easier. 
    Personal preference i think

ht|g|

    ht[g] will start the next text just below the header you create with mn[]
    remember to refresh you row-position after every nt[]

at|If you have saved hands from bbo vugraph or from lessons, teaching sessions or by yourself played hands then you will see that each new hand starts with qx[01], qx[02] and so on. You can give the user of your lin-file the opportunity to jump to the beginning of a particular chapter. Soner or later if qx[] is used you will see ^$41and or ^$7 at the bottom so you can go forward or backward one chapter.

I will show and document it later on. First the more basic single chaptered lin file.

To see how this lin tags work it is easiest to open the lin-file in notepad or any other editor to your liking. 
Then open the file in your bbo viewer and you can arrange both windows in such a way that you can read the annotation in text while you see the effect in the bbo viewer
Thats the way i learned some things, maybe you find a different way. Easier for you.
happy editing

nt||ht|g|    
at|So this text appears height/row g just below the header made with mn[].Simple as that.
all tags are documented inside. You will recognize them easy because they do not start at the beginning of the line.
Besides that i have divided them by an empty line from the next tag.
^fStarting text at column f
^ehere at column e
^dor here at d
^cor wherever you like, even at c
is done with the accent circonflex in the text
I call this inline text formatters/positioners
|

     There are special characters used WITHIN at[] and nt[]
     ^ followed by a letter will start the next text in the column you
     indicate by the letter. If you use 
     ^- the following text will be centered on the page. You have tot undo
     that effect with a next ^-
     
     then there is the {} pair. Text within this pair will be shown in a box.
     You avoid many problems if you start a new line after using ^-, 
     specially if you want to center boxes. If the following text is
     starting to low you can correct it with ht[]. just experiment 
     and you will find your style.

at|^-
Nice idea to
see
all things

in
this
fragmented text

at|use ^$40 to go to the next page|

   ^$ followed by a number indicate various icons you can put between at[]
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


   pg[] waits for you to hit the next PaGe button or the cursor keys.
mn|positioning text|nt||ht|f|

   you see above you can chain the various commands on a line. spaces,
   linefeeds, tabs, for LIN all is equal. Lin parses the text in this file until
   it meets two letters followed by [. If the code before [ is known something 
   will be shown on your screen.
   If unknown?.. End of game. Rest of your file will not been
   shown. Worst case i had was complete crash of my computer.    

3d|4|

   3d[4] will render all your boxes on the page with a simple 3d effect.
   in this case 4 pixels wide. This setting will survive nt[] and pg[].

at|^-
{3d[4] made this box with 4 pixels 3d effect}
^-|
   use of ^- was already explained.
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


    besides waiting for next page pg[] greys out text inserted before
    nice attention focussing feature. nb. text in boxes is NOT greyed out.

at|
^u{this text will start at column u and boxed. You see the problems. The text starts at column u, but the new line just starts at the beginning. Not in column u}|

  ^u is not remembered as position to start after a line-feed. If you want to start
  the new line at say column e, you have to use @2 to tell that. ^u@2 will do
  that. 

  Curious is that @2 will work on its own. It will then keep the column where you are
  at the moment you type it.

  @3 is used to mark the END of the text. @2 and @3 are reset by the use @0@1
  (see below..) The @0@1 has to be followed by a new line, either in the
  current at[] or in the new at[]. Do not do that and you wind up with some
  very narrow columns at unwanted places. But experiment with it. A new indent within
  already indented text is quite possible. 
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


  
at|

^u@2{this text will start at column u and boxed. You see no problems now.just starting new line at column u}
@0@1|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|
This text will @2indent. if i hit the <enter> key
you will see that
it
starts at the new position.
@0@1|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


ht|l|
at|^t@3Now i used an end tab ^*band^*n row positioning to put this text on a before not used part of the page. You can do that always and evrywhere.
^f@2And now i set the starttext tab at column f and see the curious effects that you can get with this simple inline text formatting characters.
@0@1|

   with ^t@3 the end-text-tab @3 is set at column t. the begin-text-tab @2
   was not set, so the current setting will be used. 
   You see then with ^f@2 the setting of begin-text-tab to colummn f. Here it
   works but most of the time it is easier to reset first with @0@1 and then
   define both tabs together. And always at the end of the text reset. Forget it
   and later you will have a hell of a job to sort out the unexpected layout 
   problems on your page
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


ht|o|
at|


^m@2^y@3Now end-text-tab and start-text-tab are set at the same time. so all text is rendered between these tabs. @0@1

ht|x|
at|this ends the part about positioning text. (hmm  well the boxes were there because they give sometimes ugly positioning problems.
On the next page more about formatting text. use ^$40 for next page.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||ht|f|
at|Just a moment. You can use all what is said on previous pages in pages where you have only the "chat-space" below the cards-table. You will see it in a hand i have inserted behind the qx[examplehand]
the ht[a-z] do work now but now seem to be divide over the much smaller available space.
In the full page as this one the a,b,c,d etc. put you lower on the page with about one text line. In the smaller chat-space that is ^*inot the case^*n|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|
Well now more about formatting text. Colors, bold, italic, fonts used, width and height of fonts, as far as i could find it| 
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


qx|hfdst2|
nt||ht|f|mn|formatting text|
at|You can make your text ^*bbold^*n
or you can make your text ^*iitalic^*n

{ the combination of both i have not found }

    In-line formatting of text starts again with ^ . 
    followed by *b the following text will be bold
    followed by *i the following text will be italic
    nb. no space needed her. see above for actual use.
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


cr|1255|cb|255|cg|1148|    you could write down here a colournames to remember.
cr|264|cb|2255|cg|2049|    i would not know how these colours look 
cr|364|cb|3155|cg|344|     but i use them colours very seldom anyway. 
cr|40|cb|40|cg|4255|
cr|50|cb|50|cg|5206|       Make a palet of colors from one "family"  
cr|60|cg|60|cb|6148|       like you do in designing a web site..
cr|70|cb|70|cg|799|        could be an advice. 
cr|8255|cg|8255|cb|8214|
cr|9239|cb|9235|cg|9222|

  colour management is done by using a palet of 9 colours
  each color can be defined by giving its rgb values. A colour picker
  you can find on many places on the net and will make your color-live much easier

  so evry c?[] starts with the paletnumber, followed BY the rgb value cr gives
  the amount of red, cb the amount of blue, cg the amount of green in the 
  chosen palet color.

at|You can use colors, for letters, for the background of letters, for the background of boxes. These colours you have to define beforehand if you want some unity and beauty in the used colors.

You can not define the used colors inline; so you have to close at..], do a cp[7] for color 7, reopen at[ ,|cp|7|at| type your coloured text , close at..] again, go back to default color with cp[]|cp||at| and see your default colors back. If your text-colour is the same as the background color you can not read anything. 
|
at|Now the background color of the letter will change, achieved in the same way, now with cs[5]|cs|5|at|
{and hopefully you will see the effect}
|cs||at|{undone now.} 
boxes around here because this only works in text typed in boxes.|
   cs[number] chooses the background on which you type but only witin boxes.
   cs[] returns to default colors
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


3d||
at|
and finally i remove the 3d effect by inserting 3d[]. And change the background-color of this page with bg[2]|
bg|2|
      bg[number] works for the background of the current page. 
      bg[] resets to default colors.
      3d[] resets the bordereffect of boxes includet mn[] to none.
pg| ***** 13 ***** |

bt||nt||mn|built in display options|ht|f|
at|From the chat-space in BBO you know the use of !h to get @h on your screen.As you see this now possible too. You use @ followed by s,h,d,c to display @s,@h,@d and @c.So in its simplest form you can write something like: Suppose you have in your hand
@sAKJT75 ^dand in dummy appears
@s932 ^dwould you finesse or cash @sAK
So far so good.
| 
     @ has here a new use. Followed dirctly by s,h,d,c for spades,heart,
     diamonds or clubs it will show the selected image.
     If you would have written @sAKJT7f^d in stead of @sAKJT7f ^d the effect 
     would indent starting with @sAKJT7  strange but true. 
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|The same is now done a little more posh with ih[]. Now no inline typing, close the at..]type ih[psAk etc. and you wil see the effect below.

ht|p|
at|^f@2 nice? yes but see next page for another use of ih[pxxxx,xx,xxx,xxxx]. This will show you how the suit was distributed over hands, you can type all suits in a hand. Find out yourself. Piece of cake if you followed till here.

The p in ih[p...] shows the pictures of the cards. Leave the p out and you will see a somewhat simpler kind of display. If you want to highlight cards, please choose with p. Otherwise som unpredictable effects!|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


hc|sak|at|
There are 4 cards out. You have 2 x 2 tricks from top = 4. ergo: cash @sAK and hope @sQ drops.|
       hc[sahatc5] stand for Highlight Card(s) and will higlight spade ace,
       heart ace an club 5. You must undo this with lc[] and 
       name the same cards. hc[] want do this for you.
