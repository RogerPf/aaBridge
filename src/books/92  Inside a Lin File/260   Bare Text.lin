By default ^*baaBridge^*n and all other lin file players, start by displaying the four seats of a bridge table.  (There is also a command to do this later in the file @-  the  !st!  command, think  @- Standard Table).  Tutorial lin files like this one, need to start with a blank screen. This is done with the   !bt!   command, think  @- Bare Text. 

A   !bt!    is the first command in this lin file, after the font and color definitions.

We have had a brief introduction to the   !at!   (Add Text) command.   A major command that is almost identical is 

^*b!nt!   @-  New Text^*n   

this command does everything that !at! does in addition it also clears almost everything that is displayed in the text area of the tutorial.  This includes the text, the margins and the headers (all covered later).


Please click   ^*bStep > ^*n   and from now on please click  ^*bStep > ^*n  after as you have read the latest addition.|

The next two commands in this file  are a  !pg!  followed by an  !nt!, this is how they are often used together. 
Clicking on  ^*bStep > ^*n  tells ^*baaBridge^*n to go passed the current  !pg!  stop point and obey the  !nt!  and so clear the screen.  I (the author) then add a new title, margins and text.

^*bUsability Hint^*n

When using    !at! <lots of text> !    ^*b blank lines^*n  in the flow of the text are always shown to the user.  So it is common to write something like @-







... !at!

This text will always show with a blank line above it.
