It is possible to define fonts which permanently have all these features.  However it is far more common to switch these properties on and off inline, in an !at!<text>! command.


^c@^*b ^e^*bBold On^*n ^j@^*n ^l ends  @-  Bold, Underline, Italic,  internal and external Links.
^c@^*u ^e^*uUnderline On^*n ^j@^*n ^l ends  @-  Bold, Underline, Italic,  internal and external Links.
^c@^*i ^e^*iItalic On^*n ^j@^*n ^l ends  @-  Bold, Underline, Italic,  internal and external Links.

Bold, in particular, is used a lot in many lin files.  The heading at the start of the page is produced by @-

Can you have more than one attribute set On? 


	^c^*bBold ^*uUnderline ^*iItalic^*n

	
As you can see with ^*baaBridge^*n (as it uses a more modern font system than earlier lin file players) you can.
