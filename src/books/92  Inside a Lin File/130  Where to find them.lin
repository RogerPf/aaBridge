This lin file, that you are reading now, should have come to you as part of a 'jar' file which forms the ^*baaBridge^*n lin file playing program.

Locate that jar file, make a copy of it and rename the copy to '.zip' instead of '.jar'.  You can then use any 'unzip' program to expand it and so create all the files and folders that are in the 'jar'.

You should then be able to see a 'books' folder. Inside that folder is another folder with the name '92  Inside a Lin File'.  That is where you will find this and the other files that make up this 'book'.


|cp|5|at|^-{^*b  If you want to understand how lin files work @- look inside them as you also read them here.  }^-|cp||at|^*n


While there is only one lin file specification they tend to come in three distinct styles.

Files containing Single deals, see @-  Various on-line bridge playing sites and other small bridge sites

Files containing Multiple deals see the Viewgraph Project @-  ^*Hwww.sarantakos.com/bridge/vugraph.html^*n

The third type of lin file is the |cp|7|at|^*bTutorial style lin file^*n|cp||at|, like the one that you are reading now.  The whole of this application is about ^*bTutorial style lin files^*n.

The |cp|7|at|^*bvery best source^*n|cp||at| for these is @-  Howard Schutzman website,    ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge^*n


^-^*bTutorial lin files^*n are also known as  Presentations  or  ^*bBridge Movies^*n.^-
