A sequence like         !at!|cp|7|at|^*b@^-^*n|cp||at|This text will be centered.|cp|7|at|^*b@^-^*n|cp||at|!        will center the text on that line. 

|cp|5|at|^-This text will be centered.^-|cp||at|

^b@2If your require  100% compatibility with older lin file players then you had best write it in your lin file as @-

^c!at!|cp|7|at|^*b@^-^*n|cp||at|This text will be centered.|cp|7|at|
^c^*b@^-^*n|cp||at|!

^bdoing this avoids known  'lost text'  issues associated with older players player.

|cp|5|at|^-This text will be centered.
^-|cp||at|


^b^*bCentering Respects Margins ^*n     

^cHere a left margin has been put at    >@2L   and a right margin has been placed immediately after    >R@3

|cp|5|at|^-This text will be centered.^-|cp||at|




|cp|5|at|^-This text will be centered. As will this text which spreads out over 
multiple lines when seen ^^ on the screen and also contains an in line 'new line' early on and a new line @^@^ towards the end.^-|cp||at|

Text can be boxed,    !at!|cp|7|at|^*b@{^*n|cp||at| boxed text |cp|7|at|^*b@}^*n|cp||at|!    will appear as  { boxed text }


Put a newline between the words,    !at!|cp|7|at|^*b@{^*n|cp||at| boxed @^@^ text |cp|7|at|^*b@}^*n|cp||at|!     and it will appear as

^n{ boxed ^^ text }


More reasonably, center the text as well     !at!|cp|7|at|^*b@^- @{^*n|cp||at| boxed @^@^ text |cp|7|at|^*b@} @^- ^*n|cp||at|! 

^-{ boxed ^^ text }^-


Or, if trying to avoid  NetBridgeVu's  'lost text'  issues write it as @-

^c!at!|cp|7|at|^*b@^- @{^*n|cp||at| boxed
^ctext |cp|7|at|^*b@} 
^c@^- ^*n|cp||at|!


which will also show as @-
^-{ boxed 
text }

The   !cs!|cp|7|at|^*b7^*n|cp||at|!   (fill) Color Select    command,   sets the fill color for boxes.  The digit is one of your defined colors.

^c!cs!|cp|7|at|^*b7^*n|cp||at|!at!|cp|7|at|^*b@^- @{^*n|cp||at| boxed
^ctext |cp|7|at|^*b@} 
^c@^- ^*n|cp||at|!

shows as 
|cs|7|at|^-{ boxed 
text }

Boxes can overlap

^b@2!cs!!   Clears the set color.

^b@2Some lin file players show the thin black boarder around all boxes not just around the default fill color box.  AaBridge does not.


Some lin file players support a   !3d!!    command, aaBridge does not.  Why? Too much of an early 1990's "early graphics" look to it, which does not fit well with aaBridge's display policy.
