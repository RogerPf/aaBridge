^c@2!mb!1d|cp|7|at|^*b!^*n|cp||at|! ^f@2This is the most common form.  The exclamation mark following the bid makes it an (un-annotated) alert.

^c!mb!2dd|cp|7|at|^*b!^*n|cp||at|r! ^f@2This is the more complex form, where there is an unlimited string of bids. Notice how the letter  'd'  can be both the  'd'  of diamond and the  'd'  of double,  and that  'r'  is redouble. The |cp|7|at|^*b!^*n|cp||at| exclamation mark of an alert must again  ^*b follow^*n  the alerted bid.
