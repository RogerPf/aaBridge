External links have the form               ^*b@^*h^*nhwww.anywhere.com/some/place/page@^*b@^*h^*n

Note the  ^*b@^*h^*n  which marks the start and the  ^*b@^*n^*n  which marks the end. They have fixed display and hover colors.
^b@0

^bThe first link below should open as a normal web page in your browser

A normal Non lin url @- ^*hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/^*n


^bThe next four links each download a lin file and launch |cp|7|at|^*b another copy of aaBridge ^*n|cp||at| with that lin file showing.
^bThe downloaded lin files are saved in the |cp|5|at|^*b autosaves ^*n|cp||at| folder.
