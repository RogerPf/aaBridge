The next page repeats this same question but with the   !st!    'standard table'  showing.  As there is no space for this text on that page it has been put here.|

Questions can also be positioned up or down the full page screen, use 
  
^e!hf!p!       where  'p' is a 'positioning letter'

^e!hf!u!       u or a higher letter,  switches this this OFF  - it is NOT cleared otherwise.|

An 'lb - Question', is very like a  !pg!!  command,  in that,  it is stop point. 

^dYou, the user, have to click a button to get past it.|
