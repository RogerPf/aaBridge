The hand definitions follow the flow of the text.  Up to four hands or part hands, south first. Any missing hand is NOT auto filled in.|

at|Please note that the example shown above has a 'p' as the first character in the South hand, it means pictures. Pictures and any other first character options are not supported and are ignored.

Also NOT supported and ignored are  !hc!<cards>!    highlight  cards    and    !lc!<cards>!   lowlight  cards.
