The next page repeats this same question but with      !st!       a  'standard table'  showing. 



The next page has a   ^*b?^*n   showing on  ^*bboth^*n  the playing table and the bid summary area.  That question  mark is created with a   ^*bmake bid^*n   command

ht|e|at|A type b, bid question knows what bidding buttons to display from what has been set up in the 'standard table' even if the table is not currently being shown.      This is demonstrated over the next few 'pages'





You can have multiple correct answers - this case 7@s , 7@h or 7@d



^fNote          pass => ^*bp^*n            double  => ^*bx^*n    NOT 'd'           and      redouble => ^*br^*n 

^h(in the   !mb!...!   make bid  command   double  is   ^*bd^*n    not  'x'   @-   not my design  )

The previous section told how you can make a question mark   ^*b?^*n   showing on   ^*bboth^*n   the playing table and the bid summary area.  Such a question  mark is made created with a   ^*bmake bid^*n   command.

^g^*b!mb!?!^*n



Because a number of older lin files have not used the   ^*b!mb!?!^*n    where it would make the text clearer if it had been used, ^*baaBridge^*n will  ^*bautomaticaly^*b add a  Question Mark  ^*b?^*n  (to the playing table only)  Whenever  @-

The standard table is showing     and     bidding is taking place    and     ANY question is showing


(see the next page as an example )    


You can tell an   Automatic Question Mark   from a standard one, as only the standard question mark also appears in the bidding summary area, top right.




This does mean that on rare occasions there will be a spurious  ?  showing when one would not expect it.

    example on next page.
