Color definitions, are commonly put at the start of the lin file with the fonts. They consist of a set of commands normally all written on one line. For example @- 

^d  cr!|cp|7|at|^*b7^*n|cp||at|255!   cb!|cp|7|at|^*b7^*n|cp||at|0!   cg!|cp|7|at|^*b7^*n|cp||at|0!                  (it is safe to add a comment here, like @-)    7 red

The above is a definition for   Color |cp|7|at|^*b7^*n|cp||at|  there can be up to a maxium of 9 colors numbered from  1 to 9.

^c !cr!|cp|7|at|^*b7^*n|cp||at|255!    ^gRed component  @-  255

^c !cg!|cp|7|at|^*b7^*n|cp||at|0!    ^gGreen component  @-  0

^c !cb!|cp|7|at|^*b7^*n|cp||at|0!    ^gBlue component  @-  0

While, unlike fonts, you can change the values of colors in the middle of the file. However, I recommend you keep these numbered colors at the same color value through out your lin file.  You will find life simpler that way.

You switch to using the color  |cp|7|at|^*b7^*n|cp||at|  with the command     !cp!|cp|7|at|^*b7^*n|cp||at|!     while     !cp!!    will restore the default of black.

All the red |cp|7|at|^*b7^*n|cp||at|'s on this page are being displayed using this color definition.

There is also the  !cs!|cp|7|at|^*b7^*n|cp||at|!   command that sets the fill color of any boxes you create, |cs|7|at| covered { later }.   !cs!!  restores this fill color to the default background.

The  !cq!7!   option to set the color of 'questions' is not supported.  Why? - questions now have their own color policy.
