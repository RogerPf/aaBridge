Lin files consist of a sequence of letter pair commands.  The main structural commands are   !qx!   and   !pg!   

Please click   ^*bStep > ^*n|

You have just actioned a  !pg!  command.  The earlier text has been grayed and any additional new text is now showning.

Please click   ^*bStep > ^*n   and from now on please click  ^*bStep > ^*n  after as you have read the latest addition.|

What is happening is that all the other commands like  !at!  are being obeyed and this continues until  ^*baaBridge^*n  gets to the next  !pg!  when it stops.   For  !pg!  think   'Page'   but as we know, it is not a real page.|

If you look down at the area below the   ^*bStep > ^*n   and   ^*bFlow^*n   buttons you will see the 'Navigation Bar'.  It has bumps on it labelled @-  'B', 'Str1' and 'Str2' etc.  The first bump shows the at beginning of the file, while the others show where a  ^*b!qx!<qx_label>!^*n  command has been put.|

The <qx_label> can be used as the arrival point of an Internal Link, see the later topic.|

When you click on the Navigation Bar ^*baaBridge^*n jumps to the nearest !pg!.   When you click on a !qx! bump 
^*baaBridge^*n jumps to to the first  !pg! ^*b after^*n that  !qx!.|

In large lin files with a lot of !qx! commands they show in two different ways.  

The !qx!'s that have a lot of !pg!'s following them show exactly (see the nav bar below) as do the ones we have here.  

Others, that have very few !pg!'s, show as narrow spikes not as wide bumps.  All are still clickable.

^l P.S.   for  'pg'  commands               !pg!|cp|7|at| any text here is ignored |cp||at|!
