Fonts definitions, if used, should be set at the start of the lin file. They consist of a set of commands normally all written on one line. For example @- 

^d fh!|cp|7|at|^*b4^*n|cp||at|66!   ff!|cp|7|at|^*b4^*n|cp||at|Arial!   fb!|cp|7|at|^*b4^*n|cp||at|5!  fm!|cp|7|at|^*b4^*n|cp||at|!                (it is safe to add a comment here, like @-)    Font 4

The above is a definition for   Font |cp|7|at|^*b4^*n|cp||at|   there can be up to a maxium of 4 fonts numbered from  1 to 4.

^c !fh!|cp|7|at|^*b4^*n|cp||at|66!    ^hHeight @- defines the Font Height as 66

^c !ff!|cp|7|at|^*b4^*n|cp||at|Times Roman!    ^hFamily @- defines the Font Family as   Times Roman

^c !fb!|cp|7|at|^*b4^*n|cp||at|5!    ^hBoldness @- defines the Font Boldness as 5   (normal, <=4  OR  bold, >= 5)

The last command !fm! is  Font Make @- there can only be one !fm! per font in the whole file hence it is normal to have them all at the start.  Additional later  !fm!'s  for a previously 'made font' are ignored.

You switch to using font  |cp|7|at|^*b4^*n|cp||at|  with the command     !fp!|cp|7|at|^*b4^*n|cp||at|!     while     !fp!!    will restore the standard font.

So the string @-     at! I wonder !fp!|cp|7|at|^*b4^*n|cp||at|!at!how big!fp!!at! this font will make the text. !        shows as


^f   I wonder |fp|4|at|how big|fp||at| this font will make the text.

There is also the cmd  !fi!|cp|7|at|^*b4^*n|cp||at|!   |fp|3|at|italic font|fp||at|.  Rarely used as there is an option to make  ^*ispecific text italic^*n, covered later.
