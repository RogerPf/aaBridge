The next page repeats this same question but with      !st!       a  'standard table'  showing. 



The next page has a   ^*b?^*n   showing on  ^*bboth^*n  the playing table and the bid summary area.  That question  mark is created with a   ^*bmake bid^*n   command

ht|e|at|A type b, bid question knows what bidding buttons to display from what has been set up in the 'standard table' even if the table is not currently being shown.      This is demonstrated over the next few 'pages'





You can have multiple correct answers - this case 7@s , 7@h or 7@d



^fNote          pass => ^*bp^*n            double  => ^*bx^*n    NOT 'd'           and      redouble => ^*br^*n 

^h(in the   !mb!...!   make bid  command   double  is   ^*bd^*n    not  'x'   @-   not my design  )
