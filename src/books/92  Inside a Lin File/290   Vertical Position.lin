^b@2^*bVertical Position^*n

You can set the current vertical position (where, up or down the page the next line of text will appear) by using a two letter pair 'bar command'.  Unfortunately this command has about the worst name possible.

^c!^*bht^*n!<letter>!    @-   think        ^*bH^*nell of a silly name for vertical ^*bT^*next position         (or whatever)   [sigh]

<letter> is  a to z,  or  A to Z.  Every page is divided up into 25 zones (not the same as the height of a line) the top of the page is at zone 'a' and zone 'z' is little up from the bottom of the page.   (26 letters, 25 zones).





!nt!!
mn!A big double height mn-header goes here taking a lot of space
|cp|7|at|^*b!ht!e!^*n|cp||at|
at!
^b@2A safe place to put text that misses the mn-header
!





Note @- when an  !st!  Standard Table  is showing  ^*b there are still 25 zones ^*n @- but they are much narrower!
