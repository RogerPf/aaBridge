An  !mn!  Header has its own weird and wonderful rules @- 
^c@2
It always puts itself at the top of the page. 

It decides its own color (but there is an option to fix it at green).

It ignores any margins you may have set. 

The text has its own set font and size and it is always light in color.  

Up to a certain size it will fit itself on to one line.

^b@2
Go over that size and @-

Unexpectedly it is cleared by the  ^*b next^*n   !pg!  command,  NOT by the  !nt!  as Ronald's docs states.

       (that is the   !pg!   command that comes  ^*bafter^*n  the one on which the system stops to display the mn-header)

The  !mn!  header can be preserved from the clearing effects of the   !pg!   command by the use of 

^g !tu!y!

    However the clearing power of   !pg!   can be restored.

If you write a    huge  mn-header     that would spill on to a third line then   NOTHING   will be shown.

If you inspect this lin file you will see that there are two   mn-headers   defined on this page.

Only the second one gets shown.


The switch to turn the   mn-headers   on or off       !tu!y!     !tu!!     can be set many times on the page 

but only the last value (the one before the end !pg! of the page) counts.
