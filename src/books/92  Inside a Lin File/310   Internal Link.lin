Internal links go inline in text and have the form  @-

^d^*b@^*g<qx_label>,^*nNice text you can see and click on^*b@^*n^*n

Note the  ^*b@^*g^*n  which marks the start and the  ^*b@^*n^*n  which marks the end. The <qx_label> must match a 'qx label' somewhere in the lin file.  They have fixed display and hover colors.

^c^*glast,Clicking Here ^*n will take you to the last page of this lin file

Note that - with aaBridge you also have luxury of the Navigation Bar, below the   ^*bStep > ^*n   and   ^*bFlow^*n   buttons. 



@2^*bInternal Link to another lin file in this Book^*n         this is an|cp|7|at| aaBridge only|cp||at| feature

Write the <qx_label> in your link to as <qx_label:part_filename>  where 'part_filename' matches ^*bany part^*n of the filename of another lin file in the current book.  The files are tested in alphabetic order so the early ones will match first.


^c^*gStr2:Lin file St,Click here ^*n to go to the  'Str2'  page of the file     'nnn ... Lin_filename.lin'.


The link above has the form

^d^*b@^*g|cp|7|at|Str2:Lin filename|cp||at|,Click here ^*b@^*n^*n  to go to...
