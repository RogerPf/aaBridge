^-|fp||at|^B@2^Y@3Every bridge player has heard the, "Lead partner's suit unless you have a good reason not to." Let us assume partner opens or overcalls a suit, but eventually your RHO becomes the declarer in a suit contract, and you are on lead. Let us look at what are the standard choices for a good opening lead.

If you have not supported the partner
^CLead low from three or more cards.

If you have supported partner (showing at least 3-card support)
^CLow if you have one honor
^CHigh if you do not have an honor

Whether you have or have not supported the partner   
^CTop of touching cards.
^CTop of a doubleton (whether or not you have an honor)
^CHigh from an honor sequence of 2 or more adjacent honors--10 is considered an honor. 
^CIf you choose to lead partner's suit holding an Ace, lead the Ace.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, a couple of further points. Should Kia bid 2@S? I would. But there are 2 arguments against bidding 2@S. The first is Kia has a flattish hand (no singletons or voids) which is a downgrade when playing in a suit.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 2nd is 3 cards in the opponents suit, especially when it has not been raised, is the worst holding you could have.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said all that, I still would bid 2@S with Kia's hand. In general, over interference, if you still can make the bid you would have made, then make it. Kia's not bidding 2@S would make me think he only had a 5-card suit.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now how should Liz know to lead a diamond after her 2nd ruff. 2 reasons. One is she knows Don does not have the @CJ, because he would have played it at trick 1 with AKJ. 2 is he lead a high heart back, which is suit preference for diamonds. He could have been out of clubs, but if he wanted a club back he would have led another low heart.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Remember, when giving your partner a ruff, the spot card you lead back is suit preference. There are 2 suits Don could want back, clubs and diamonds. If he leads back a low heart he wants the lower suit (clubs). If he leads back a high heart he wants the higher suit, diamonds.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since I underbid the first time, I will overbid this time :). If Kia has a bust hand, then I made a mistake. But in general, when you are not sure what to do, you do an "average" calculation. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Say Liz has 7-8 points on average. I have 19, meaning we have 26 or 27 combined between the 2 of us.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That leaves approximately 13 or 14 points between Don and Kia and Kia will have half of them. That means Kia on average will have 6 or 7 points, in which case I want to be in game. That doesn't mean you are always right, but "on average" you will be -:).|mb|4S|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have to worry about spades and diamonds. Liz could be short in one or both. After wining the lead in my hand, the first thing I will do is play spades so that if Don has 4 spades to the jack, I can find out and pick up the suit.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now the question is how should I play the diamond suit. There is the old "8 ever 9 never" rule, which says with a 9-card fit missing the queen I should play for the drop. But that rule is rather flawed. |
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If there is no information from the bidding, then it is ok to play for the drop, although the percentage is only like 51 or 52% that it works, as opposed to the finesse which is 50%.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if you never play for the drop, you will be right almost as often as playing the finesse. On this hand, I have some important information. I already know 8 of Liz's cards, 6 hearts and 2 spades. So she only has 5 unknown cards.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand I only know 5 of Don's cards, 2 hearts and 3 spades—he has 8 unknown cards, Therefore, the odds are 8/5 (much greater than 50%) that he has the Queen.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you don't want to do the math, just use the following rule. If one person has shown a long suit (5+ cards) finesse the other person for the queen when you have a 9-card fit.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A Kib:  Why not find out if East has Ace of clubs first. With the @CA and the queen of diamonds East would too strong for a Weak-2 bid. |
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a good point. As was said, with @CA and @HKJ that gives 9 HCP. Meaning a @DQ would give her 11 HCP and then she would open 1H not 2.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I take it you play regular Bergen Raises Don. So let me count my Bergen declarer points. I have 14.5—12 HCP, -1 for dubious @CJx, + 1 length point, +1 for the 4 card suit, +1 for the 2 doubletons, and since I am an optimist, I add .5 for my almost quality diamond suit (the 9 is almost the 10 -:). |
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If vul in IMPs I definitely bid 4 but here I will just bid 3 although not surprised if I make 4. Having said that, Don should go to 4 anyway. Whenever you have 5-card support with a limit raise, you should first make a Bergen limit raise, in case you have slam.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But even if partner bids only 3, you should bid 4 with 5-card support, because a 10-card fit often makes 4. That is another good feature of Bergen raises. You can make a "forcing" limit raise. Doesn't mean we will make, but we have good chances.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, I am glad we are in 4@S. It will make if either the diamond finesse or spade finesse works, which makes it a 75% contract. Unfortunately they both lose, but you still want to be in a contract that has a 75% chance of making. Remember when you analyze a hand, don't be a ^*B"results"^*N player.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Figure out, if you can, whether the odds favor your making the contract. If they do, you want to be there regardless of whether or not it makes. Similarly, just because you luckily make a contract (for example, you win 3 finesses, a 12.5% chance) that does not mean you want to be there because 88% of the time you will go down. In the long run it is a losing proposition.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Liz has a tough decision. She should assume a 9 card spade fit. But she only has 7 points. So unless I have 18 or 19 we probably don't want to be in game.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if I have 18 or 19, I probably double again, especially if I am short in hearts. This is a case where Liz should pass. She has about the number of points I should expect. She is unbalanced and other than her 5th spade, she has nothing special.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With a singleton heart, she would have a much better case for bidding 4@S. I am aggressive, but you also need to know that (occasionally -:) ) pass is the correct bid.|

nome: Most likely Liz has 2 hearts. So I can play the king under the ace and Don will stay on lead and I can trump the third heart.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Liz was both lucky and unlucky on this hand. She was lucky I had a very nice hand. But she was unlucky I had only 3 spades and the spades broke badly. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, when bidding over a preempt, you should worry very much about how many trumps you have.|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Liz has every right to assume a 9-card fit, and when someone preempts, the odds of a 3-2 break are lower. |
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, over a preempt, you should be wary of bidding a marginal game with only an 8 card fit, especially when you are 4-4 as opposed to 5-3. Because a 4-1 break when you are 4-4 means one defender has the same trump length as you, which is not a good thing.|

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
