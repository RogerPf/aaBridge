^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You are technically too strong for 3@D, but since pard passed it probably won't hurt you.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


MB|4C|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is true Don that you shouldn't pass with a singleton diamond. But what is our most likely game? To support my hearts, you would like to have 4-card support, but preempts often make you have to make  non-optimal choices. So you need to find the bid that is most likely to get us the best result if it works out.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


UB||mb|3H|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although 3@H is not the perfect bid, it has a lot more upside than 4@C. 4@C is likely to be passed out. It may make, it may go down, but either way it won't be that great a result. Whereas if you bid 3@H and I bid 4@H, if it makes, that is a good result. So, when faced with a choice of imperfect bids, choose the one with the most upside.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


mb|p|NT||lb|*bWhat could Howard bid?^^4h|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I know Don is supposed to have 4 hearts, but he might have been stuck and only has 3. But let's count my declarer points. 5 HCP, 3 length points for starters. Once we find a fit, my declarer addons are 1 for the doubletons, and 2 for the extra length. So I have 10 declarer points. I would have strongly preferred to have a singleton somewhere.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That would have vastly improved my hand. Whenever you end up in a suit, you much prefer unbalanced hands (hands with singletons or voids) to balanced hands. On the other hand, we may have at least a 10-card fit and very possibly an 11-card fit. If we were vul and this were IMPs I have a  4@H bid. Based on LOTT I think I will bid 4, but it is a tad aggressive. |mb|4H|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Please note, Kia's preempt made me have to guess, as well as Don
I have had several questions about if a double by Don would be a support double. The answer, unless you have a different agreement, is no. You only should play support doubles if partner can raise you to the 2 level. If partner's double causes you to have to go to the 3-level, then double is no longer a support double.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |

nome: With a void in hearts and non vul I can bid 5@D. On the other hand, Jenny could have some hearts and I have some defense. So 5@D is my bid.|mb|5D|

mb|p|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is what is called a "forcing pass" situation. We voluntarily bid game. Therefore, we must either double Kia or bid 5 of our suit.|

mb|p|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If Don passes, I must either bid 5@H or double 5@D. I don't love doubling, as Kia could be void in hearts, but I don't want to bid 5 over 5 either with a doubleton diamond and possibly 2 diamond losers.|mb|d|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason kia's 5@D bid was a good bid was because of his heart void. When you are deciding whether or not to bid on, and it is a close decision, your length in the opponent's suit is a key factor. |
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A void is worth its weight in gold. A singleton is good also and would tend to push you to bid on. But with a void it is almost always right to bid on.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's see how we do in 4@H. I lose a spade and a diamond for sure. If I play the heart suit correctly I won't lose any tricks, but that requires that I lead the @HQ from Don's hand first. If I mistakenly lead low and finesse the @HJ, then Jenny will get a  heart trick. In any case I make either 4 or 5. So kia made a great bid. The void was really why the bid worked out so well.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let me see if I have a 2@C opener. Any time you have 20 or more HCP you should consider opening 2@C. The criteria for opening 2@C are that you have 4 quick tricks, and a 9-trick hand. |

PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|To count tricks in a long suit I assume partner has an "average" number of low cards in the suit. Since I have a 6 card suit, that means there are 7 out against me which means on average, partner will have 2 1/3 hearts 7 divided by 3. |
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most of the time partner could have even 3. If we have an 8-card fit, missing the Q and J, it is likely we would lose 1 heart which means I have 5 heart tricks for the purposes of deciding whether or not to open 2@C. |
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore I have 7.5 tricks which is not even close to 9 tricks.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


AT|
kib: This is not what you have been teaching in the past Howard.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good question. When deciding whether or not to open 2@C, I have, in the past, talked about how you can use either the "9 Winners Rule" or the Marty Bergen "4 and 4 Rule"—4 or more quick tricks and 4 or fewer losers. Recently I talked with Marty Bergen about this and I have come up with a way where you can combine these 2 approaches into a single approach. |
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The "9 Winners Rule" says you can open 2 clubs if you have a hand that will likely take 9 tricks even if partner has no HCP. I will give an example below of how you calculate how many winners your hand is worth. The "4 and 4 Rule" says you can open 2@C if you have a hand with 4 or more quick tricks and 4 or fewer losers. |
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, Marty has always been a bit vague about how you decide how many losers the hand has. You most definitely should not use the Ron Klinger Losing Trick Count method to calculate losers (although some students mistakenly do so) because this will usually under estimate the number of losers you have, and you will incorrectly open 2@C on many hands.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When I talked with Marty, he and I came to the conclusion that a 9 winner hand is the equivalent of a 4 or fewer losers hand. So the way I now like to think about it is that you should open 2@C with any hand that contains 4 or more quick tricks and 9 or more winners. Note this does not contradict my previous teaching. It simplifies it.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One other caveat. You should think twice about opening 2@C when your long suit is a minor. There are 2 reasons for this. One reason is, in order to make game in your suit, you have to go to the 5-level, meaning you have to take 11 tricks to make game rather than the 9 or 10 tricks you need to make a game in NT or a major. It is much harder to take 11 tricks than 10 tricks. |
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other equally important reason is that the bidding will get very high very fast. If you open 2@C, partner will almost always bid 2@D, and you will have to start your real bidding at the 3-level because you have to bid 3@C or 3@D. |
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So by opening 2@C, you have effectively preempted yourself. Also, if your suit happens to be diamonds, the weak hand is more likely to end up as declarer (since responder bid 2@D), which is another disadvantage of opening 2@C. So, unless I have a very clear cut 2@C opener when I have a long minor, I try to open in 1 of my minor.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the hand in above, let us apply this method and see if I should open 2@C. I have 1 spade trick and 1 - 1.5 club tricks for a total thus far of 2 - 2.5 tricks. |
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As I said earlier, to count tricks in a long suit, I assume partner has an "average" number of low cards in that suit. Since, on this hand, I have a 6-card heart suit, that means there are 7-hearts out against me. |
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since each of the other hands will, on average, hold 1/3 of the remaining cards, my partner will, on average have "2.33" hearts in the suit. That means, on average I will usually have an 8-card fit and sometimes even a 9-card fit. I assume the hearts will break the most likely way (3-2 with an 8-card fit). |
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Missing both the @HQ and @HJ, this means I will likely lose 1 heart. That means I can count 5 heart tricks for the purpose of calculating how many winners I have.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So 5 hearts plus the 2-2.5 tricks in the other suits is not even close to 9 tricks and I should not open 2@C.|lc|sacaqhakt87|mb|1H|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


mb|2D|NT||lb|*bWhat should North bid?^^x|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Don should make a negative double. Granted he is not happy about his singleton heart nor about his 3 diamonds. 3 small is the worst holding you can have in the opponents suit. But he has 5 spades and some points. so he doubles and hopes for the best.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


mb|d|mb|p|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is possible that Don has 5 spades and is too weak to bid 2@S which is in fact true on this hand. But I have 20 points and really nice hearts, so I am going to bid 4@H as our most likely game.|mb|4H|

By doubling essentially Don bid spades and leading the opps suit is not usually a good idea. So choose either spades or clubs.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Don should make a takeout double. The hand meets the Rule of 20 and has great distribution for a takeout double. Remember Howard's philosophy "when in doubt, it is better to bid than pass" :).|mb|d|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


mb|3H|MB|X|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's discuss the auction as it has proceeded. Playing standard methods, Kia's 3 heart bid shows 4 hearts and less than a limit raise. So he clearly has his bid. I personally like to play Bergen Raises are on over a takeout double, so I would bid 3@D (7-9 point raise) if playing with one of my partners. But 3@H is the standard bid, as most play Bergen is off over interference.|
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now what about Jenny's double. I think she meant it as what is called a "responsive" double. A responsive double is somewhat analogous, but not identical, to a negative double. A negative double is made by responder to an opener, when it goes opening bid-overcall-double. If you play responsive doubles (I don't), then if it goes opening bid-overcall or double-raise-double that is a responsive double. So, a responsive double is made by the partner of the overcaller. |
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Anyway, if the advancer doubles after a raise, it has the following meaning. For example, if Don had overcalled a suit (for example say he bid 2@D) so say it had gone 1@H-2@D-3@H-dbl. In that case Jenny's double would show the other 2 suits (spades and clubs) and a pretty good hand since we are at the 3 level or 4 level. Over a takeout double, as on this hand, Jenny's bid would say she has some points and wants Don to pick his best suit. But on this hand, I don't think you need to play responsive doubles.|
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this bidding cycle, Jenny should assume Don has 4 spades, because he just about always does to make a takeout double of 1@H. Jenny should simply bid 3S, showing a 10 or 11 point hand with 4+ spades. Again, make the bid which, if it works out, will give you the best result. Although 3@S is not forcing, Jenny would be happy to hear Don bid 4@S.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@S is the correct bid. Don already said he has an opener with 4 spades and that's what he has. Jenny has basically said she has a limit raise in spades. But I admit, the singleton heart is a great feature of Don's hand. Let's count his dummy points. 11 HCP, 1 length point, 1 quality suit point, and 2 (or 3) points for the singleton heart that is 15 or 16 dummy points.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is very possible that they have an 8 card fit, so making Jenny ruff is to the defense's advantage. It shortens dummy's trump making it hard to set up dummy's 5 card club suit. Remember, giving declarer a ruff that they are entitled to is at worst a "passive" defense, meaning it gives nothing away. And sometimes it prematurely shortens declarers trump. So never be reluctant to make declarer ruff if you have no better play.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|
2@S is not totally inconceivable but aggressive. The hand does have 6 spades but with several flaws for preempting:
^ca) it is flat (no singletons or voids)
^Cb) we are vul.
^Cc) he only has 3 HCP
^Cd) his suit is not totally weak, but below average in terms of a 6-card suit.|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So pass is probably best. But if were playing against someone who was better than me, I would preempt. Remember that when you are playing in a tournament most people get timid when playing against experts. But that is exactly the wrong thing to do. If you give experts a free run, they will likely bid the hand correctly and beat you on average. If you put pressure on them by being aggressive and preempting, they will make some mistakes and you will increase your odds of getting a good result.|ub||

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For Jenny either 1@D or 1@H is ok. I generally bypass diamonds when my hand is weak. Here is why. Suppose Jenny bid 1@D and I bid 1@S. now it will be hard to find the heart fit. So with a weak hand I bypass diamonds to bid my major. On the other hand, if I have a hand strong enough for 2 bids then I would bid 1@D. Here jenny has a weak hand, so 1@H is a bit better than 1@D.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Jenny you should open 1N. Whenever you have 15-17 balanced your best bid is 1N. It is the most descriptive bid, and auctions starting with 1N or 2N openers are usually very accurate. On this hand, for example suppose Jenny opened 1@D and I bid 1@H. Then should she bid 2@H or 3@H? Not clear.|

CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
