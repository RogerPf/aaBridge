Although I am not a big fan of quantitative 4N, this is one auction where I do play it. So if I decided to invite with Kia's hand, he would bid 4N, asking Babs to bid 6 with a good 23 or 24.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Turns out pass by Kia is right, as they can't make 3N. I would have been very uncomfortable passing with Kia's hand, but with a flat 15, I think it rates to be the best bid. But if pard had hearts and a reasonable hand (8+ points) 4@H could easily be making.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Kia has to make the best guess he can, and whatever he chooses will turn out to be wrong a significant portion of the time. You just can't worry about it. Good pre-empts cause that to happen.|

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|1|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
