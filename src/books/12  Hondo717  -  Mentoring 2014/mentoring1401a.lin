In match points I might bid 2@H because it might score slightly higher. However, I know we have at least a moderate diamond fit, whereas Babs could easily have a singleton or void in hearts, so 2@D rates to be a safer IMP contract.|mb|p|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well done Babs. If Babs keeps this up, we will have to find a student more interesting for the kibs -:). We already discussed the bidding. A couple of points on the play and defense. Babs did well to ruff her 3rd spade before drawing trumps. In general you should draw trumps ASAP. You never have to delay drawing trumps when ruffing in the long hand. But the most common reason to delay drawing trumps, as on this hand, is when you need to ruff something in the hand with short trumps. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if you draw trumps you won't be able to ruff. That situation most commonly occurs in a 5-3 fit, where you need 3 rounds to draw trump, so if you need to ruff in the hand with 3 trumps you have to do so before drawing 3 rounds of trump (which you need to do with an 8 card fit since they are at best 4-2).|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One minor point on defense. When Gail got in with the @HQ she should play the @CK to set up a club trick before Babs can set up hearts for club discards.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A club is a good lead by East and the lead of the King has a specific meaning. It says "partner encourage if you have the Ace, Queen, or Jack, discourage if you do not." So you would lead it normally from AK or KQ. However from KQ, in NT, you normally would not lead the K without either KQJ or KQ10 unless you have a six card suit. |
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, with KQxxx normally the best lead would be low. On this hand, it turns out if East can figure out North has Jx of clubs, the K works out. But in general, in NT, you should not lead the K from KQx unless you have a 6 card suit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding was straight forward and we discussed the lead. But let's talk about the play a bit. I don't blame Irene for not playing a 2nd club. But once she plays a heart, Babs is in great shape especially once diamonds behave. |
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|After running diamonds, since she still has stoppers in both hearts and clubs, Babs can afford to try for an extra spade trick. She can do one of the following. If she decides to play West for the @SK, she can lead the @SQ, and if it gets covered, she can use the @S10 to knock out the @SJ and score a 2nd spade trick.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Or, as it turns out to work on this hand, she can play West for the @SJ, and lead a low spade towards the @S10 knocking out the @SK and setting up 2 spade tricks with the @SA and @SQ. There is no harm in trying the spade play.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3N can't go down even if Babs gets it wrong. But she might make 2 or even 3 extra tricks if she gets it right.|

Please note that there might be more than one correct answers -:).^^3c|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss a couple of points on bidding after partner overcalls. First, you need to decide if a new suit by responder (me) is forcing or not. I absolutely think it should be, but some people play it is not forcing. |
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you play a new suit as forcing, then I can cue bid, one of my choices, to show a limit raise in clubs which is what I like to play. And that one reason (among several) is why I think a new suit should be forcing. But if you don't play a new suit is forcing then a cue bid is simply a nondescript forcing bid.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Assuming you play my recommendation of a cue bid as a limit raise you then have to decide how many trump it shows. Most people play a cue bid only guarantees 3-card support. But I like to play it tends to show 4-card support. A 9-card fit is much better than an 8-card fit. So I will bid a new suit often when I have 3-card support, if feasible. |
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand I do have 10 points and 3-card support. But even if you play 2@D shows a limit raise but only guarantees 3-card support I would not bid 2@D with this hand for the following reasons:|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT|^B@2
a) I only have 3 card support
b) my @DQ is suspect
c) my distribution is very flat
d) 3@C is more preemptive. so I bid 3@C.|MB|3c|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


AT| 3@C shows less than a limit raise, 6-9 or so.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, some people play that there is a way to differentiate between 3 card and 4 card limit raise. Both a cue bid and 2N show limit raises of differing length. Again, some people play the cheaper bid (2@D in this case) shows 3 card support, and the higher bid (2N in this case) shows 4 card support.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Others play that the cue bid always shows 3 card support and 2N shows 4 card support (or vice versa). The point is there is a way, if you play that, to differentiate between 3 and 4 card limit raises which is particularly important when your suit is a major. Because you want to stretch to bid game with a 9-card fit (eg. pard has 4-card support) and be more conservative with 3-card support.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is very important point and many non-expert player make an error and give declarer a gift. When you did not support partner's suit, you MUST lead count (low from 3 small) because it is more important that partner know your count than whether or not you have an honor. |
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, once partner supports your suit, you know they have 3 (or more). In that case, they can (and should) lead attitude since count is already known by the bidding. Here, since East supported diamonds, she should lead high (the @D10) to show lack of a higher honor. Since East supported, West will assume East has at least 3 and will not mistake the @D10 as high-low from a doubleton when East later plays the lower diamond.|pc|Dt|

up|41|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We already discussed the bidding point on this board. Now, let me explain why Babs, at trick 2, should figure out the best defense. It is a matter of counting, which it often is on defense. Put aside for the moment that partner supported Babs (although that is definitely something Babs should take into account). |
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Irene lead a low diamond, which means she has 1 or 3. If she has 3 (likely on the bidding) that means Gail only has 1, since Babs sees 9 diamonds between her hand and dummy. Babs needs to figure out where they are going to get their tricks. They already have 1 diamond, but they need 2 more tricks. |
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If partner has the @SA then its easy, they get 3 aces. But if partner does not have the @SA it is very possible that the spade suit will provide some discards. Then assuming no club tricks, and knowing that North has no more diamonds Babs has to lead the @HA to make sure they get 2 heart tricks if they are entitled to them. This is why defense is so hard.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And finally let us address the 4@D bid by East. Bidding 4@D can be dangerous. However, Irene correctly surmised that if Babs can bid 3@D all by herself, 4@D is reasonable with 3 card support. |
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, (and this is especially true when the opps suit is a major) bidding 4 of a minor can push the opponents into a makeable game. So although 4@D is not dangerous it may push them into a makeable game. But as it turns out, with best defense 5@C is down 1, so 4@D should have worked out well.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That probably worked out pretty well for East/West, but even -100 would have been ok. I was hoping North's points were more in diamonds and spades than hearts and clubs and I am not sure why Babs just didn't play another heart.|
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As I said in my lesson on Match Points and IMP strategy a few weeks ago doubling a vulnerable part score in Match Points can be very lucrative because down 1 for -200 is better than making a part score. And if we make it, we were probably destined for an average plus at least anyway. |
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the risk of doubling in Match Points is fairly low, because you could easily get a top and if are wrong, you only turned an average minus into a bottom. The risk reward ratio is good. But in IMPs it is not good. If we make it you doubled us into game. Whereas if we go down 1 and you can make a part score, you only win an IMP or two.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now clearly on this hand I will bid 4@S. But first let me discuss the bidding if the auction went as follows: 1N-P-2@C-P-2@D-P-?. Absent any conventional agreement, I would bid 3@S. That would show a game forcing hand asking partner to bid 4@S with 3-card support and 3N otherwise.|sk||mb|4S|
pg| ***** 116 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people play a convention called Smolen, which is ok, but I don't particularly recommend it. If you play Smolen, rather than bidding 3@S I would bid 3@H. So playing Smolen the auction 1N-2@C-2@D-3@H shows 5 SPADES (not hearts) and 4 hearts. The reason for playing that is so that the strong hand ends up as declarer always.|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over 3@H the NT bidder would bid 4@S with 3 spades and otherwise 3N. There is often a slight advantage to having the strong hand hidden and the weaker hand as dummy. But the reason I don't particularly recommend Smolen is that this sequence rarely comes up, and partners often forget they are playing Smolen and might think mistakenly that the 3@H bid shows 5 hearts and 4 spades. Just to avoid bidding problems, I think playing the jump to 3@S as natural is a better way to go. Of course on this hand it is all irrelevant.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a complicated hand to play but the contract can be made. Let me discuss how an expert might play it. There are 4 potential losers. 1 spade, 1 heart, and 2 clubs. But there are chances to eliminate some of them. |
pg| ***** 134 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's start with the spades. I know there is the famous (but often incorrect) bridge saying "8 ever, 9 never" meaning you should not finesse for the queen with a 9 card fit. But that is not really true. First of all without any information from the bidding or the play, the odds of the Queen dropping are only about 52%. |
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But you often have information from the bidding, as on this hand. And even if you don't, the finesse and the drop are essentially equal plays. However, you can greatly increase your odds if one opponent has shown a long suit. |
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As in this case where Babs showed long diamonds. Then, you should assume the person with the long suit is more likely to be short in trump and finesse the other person for the Queen. So more often than not, you end up finessing rather than playing for the drop.|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If Irene does that she makes. But she has other chances as well. The heart finesse is irrelevant, because even if it wins, she still has a heart loser. However, she can try clubs first, which gives her 2 chances. |
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First, if Babs has the @CQ she will only lose 1 club trick. 2nd, even if Gail has the @CQ, she can set up 2 club tricks in her hand, and pitch one of dummy's hearts on the @DA and the other on the long club. So it turns out an expert would make 5 on this hand, losing 2 clubs and nothing else.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With 18 HCP mostly in prime cards I know that we should be at least in game. 2@D bid is a game force. I cannot bid 2@H because I need 5 hearts for that bid.|mb|2D|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Playing 2/1, 3@H is stronger than 4@H and is a slam try. The principle of "fast arrival" applies to all 2/1 auctions. The quicker you bid game, the weaker your hand is. So a 4@H bid by me would be weaker than 3@H. My 2@D established a game force so I know partner cannot pass 3@H. By bidding 4@H, I am taking away a lot of room for exploring for slam. So I should only bid 4@H if I have no slam interest. My 3@H bid asks partner to bid controls if she has any interest in slam.|mb|3H|
pg| ***** 150 ***** |


mb|p|sk|n|NT||lb|*bWhat should be the bid?^^3s|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We have established hearts as trump so 3S is not an attempt to play in spades. It is a "control bid" showing at least some slam interest and first or second round control in spades (A, K, singleton, or void). On this hand 3@S must show the A or K since the 1@S opener guaranteed partner does not have a singleton or void. You bid controls up the line. So if, on a different hand, partner bid 4@C over 3@H, that would show a club control and also deny a spade control (since partner skipped bidding 3@S).|mb|3S|

mb|p|sk|s|NT||lb|*bWhat should South bid?^^4n|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We have all suits controlled and all I need to know is how many keycards we have. So I bid 4N.|mb|4N|

pg| ***** 156 ***** |


mb|p|NT||sk|s|lb|*bWhat should be the bid now?^^6h|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I know we have all the key cards and the trump Q. So I could ask for kings (bid 5N) and if partner has 2 (which would have to be the @SK and the @DK) we could easily be making 7.|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are 2 methods for responding to 5N. One method is "specific kings". Partner bids the lowest outside king she has over 5N. So, playing that method, on this hand, partner would bid 6@D. This denies the @CK and shows the @DK. (It says nothing about the @SK). |
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other method is ## of kings. Since 4N already asked about the trump king, 5N asks about the ## of kings not counting the trump King. Even if you play 1430 over 4N, over 5N you play straight Blackwood responses. So over 5N, 6@C shows 0 kings, 6@D shows 1 king, 6@H shows 2 kings, and 6@S shows 3 kings.|
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Many experts like to play specific kings because sometimes knowing that partner has a particular king is more important than how many kings. For example, if I had a singleton spade, I would only care about the @DK. |
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, I prefer ## of kings for 2 reasons. First, often ## of kings is more useful. For example, on this hand, it is much more useful for me to know that North has 2 kings, because I then know I have no diamond nor spade losers. If I were playing specific kings, North would respond 6@D and I would have no idea whether or not North also had the @SK. |
PG| ***** 162 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Second, if the lowest specific king is in a suit higher than the trump suit, you have to decide whether or not partner should show it. For example, on this hand, suppose North had only the @SK but not the @DK. If South is allowed to bid 6@S (bypassing 6@H) then I know we have a potential diamond loser but we are already passed by 6@H. |
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So some people play you can only show specific kings when spades are trumps. Others play you can also bid specific kings when hearts are trump (but not when diamonds or clubs are trump) but you are not allowed to bid 6@S. The whole specific king approach seems unnecessarily complicated to me, and it is not always as useful as ## of kings. So that is why I play ## of kings.|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now back to whether or not I should bid 5N, and if partner shows 2 kings (by responding 6@H), whether or not I should bid 7. I know we have no losers in any suit. So 7 only depends on a 3-2 break. However, as I explained in my recent lesson on scoring, in theory you should only bid 7 if you can just about count 13 tricks. |
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The odds should exceed 80% that 7 makes. Since a 4-1 break happens almost 1/3 of the time, a grand slam that depends on a 3-2 break should theoretically not be bid. That is why at the teaching table I only bid 6. But at a real table, I might very well bid 7 despite the mathematics, because bidding and making 7 is always very exciting.|
PG| ***** 166 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to whether you should play in NT or a suit, in general it is much easier to play slam in a suit rather than in NT. In fact, there are some hands where, even when you have a 7-card fit, slam makes in a suit contract and 6NT does not make. That is because you can sometimes score extra tricks by ruffing in the short hand. |
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So in IMPs you should always prefer playing in 6 of a suit to playing 6NT. However, in Match Points, 6NT is worth 10 extra points over 6 of a major and 70 extra points over 6 of a minor. So if you are pretty sure you have 12 tricks in NT, it is ok to bid 6N rather than 6 of a suit. |
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Playing Match Points, if I chose to bid 6 rather than 7, I would bid 6N rather than 6@H. But if I bid 7, I would bid 7@H, not 7NT because on many hands, the extra ruff could easily be my 13th trick.|mb|6H|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East plays natural over 1N. If she was playing DONT her bid should be double.|
PG| ***** 185 ***** |


sk|s|NT||lb|*bPlease help South to make a bid^^5d|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is possible that clubs is a better contract than diamonds. It is also possible that 5 of a minor will go down. But there is no way to figure that out for certain. Also, with a heart void, I know the opponents almost always have at least a 9-card fit (the NT bidder will almost never have a 5-card suit and often not even a 4-card suit). |
PG| ***** 187 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So they will be interfering in the auction if I go slow. When you have a choice of 2 suits and have no way of having partner help you decide, as on this hand, you should favor length over strength. It is much more likely we have at least a 9-card fit in diamonds (since partner only needs 3-card support) than in clubs (partner needs 4-card support). |
PG| ***** 188 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And a 9-card fit is much better than an 8-card fit. So, on this hand, I bid what I think will most likely get us a good result, which is 5@D. I have 5 potential losers (3 diamonds, 1 club, 1 spade) and hopefully partner can cover at least 3 of them.|mb|5D|
pg| ***** 189 ***** |


sk|w|NT||lb|*bWhat could be the bid?^^5h|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|5@H is a great bid for a number of reasons. On these hands, you need to "picture" likely holdings for partner to help you figure out what to do. The diamond void is huge, and West can assume at least a 10-card fit, since East's 2@H bid normally promises a 6-card suit over 1NT. |
PG| ***** 191 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If East has as little as a doubleton club and AKxxxx of hearts, 5@H makes. It will be very surprising if 5@H goes down more than 1. The only other consideration for West is a tactical one. If she bids 5@H, will she push them into a makable slam that they otherwise would not bid? With the @SAK, she should welcome their bidding 6 because it is quite possible that she can cash 2 spade tricks (and she will be on lead). So that is another reason why 5@H is a great bid.|mb|5H|
pg| ***** 192 ***** |


sk|n|NT||lb|*bWhat should be the bid by North?^^6d|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|6@D is another great bid. North has a tougher problem over 5@H. She has some great cards, the @DAK and the @CA. The @HA might be useful as well, although it is virtually certain that South is short in hearts (based on the 5@D bid) and could even have a void. The main question is whether or not there are 2 immediate spade losers. |
PG| ***** 194 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And even if there are, a heart lead is somewhat likely and the @HA might provide a discard of a losing spade if South is void in hearts. Also, with 4-card diamond support, it is quite possible there is a void in diamonds, so N/S may get no diamond tricks. Therefore, 6@D is a good bid.|
PG| ***** 195 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| It might go down, but it has a lot of upside. As it turns out, 6@D makes. So the "par" contract is 6@H doubled down 2. The "par" contract is the contract that gives the best result for all sides given the lie of the cards. On this hand, since 6@D makes and 7@D does not, 6@H doubled is "par".|mb|6D|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is reasonable to open either 1@H or 4@H with that hand. It is a matter of tactics and risk/reward. The advantage of opening 4@H is tactical. 4@H is by far the most likely contract you want to be in, and so if you bid it right away you make it more difficult for the opponents to compete accurately. |
PG| ***** 207 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The downside of 4@H is that there is a small danger that you will miss a slam. As with many hands, a good technique is to "picture" reasonable hands for partner. On this deal, partner could have as little as the @DA and a doubleton @CA with a couple of hearts and 6 would be a reasonable contract. There are many other hands partner could hold as well. |
PG| ***** 208 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, it is much more likely that partner will not hold a hand where 6@H makes, so I prefer opening 4@H to 1@H. Note that the hand is not good enough to open 2@C as it neither meets the Howard 9 trick rule nor the Bergen 4 and 4 rule.|mb|4H|
pg| ***** 209 ***** |


mb|p|mb|p|sk|n|NT||lb|*bWhat should be the bid?^^p|mb|5d|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|5@D is not unreasonable, especially given the vulnerability. When deciding whether to bid over an opponent's game bid, you need to look at several factors. One is the length and strength of your suit. With the North hand, that factor is definitely in favor of bidding, with a 6 card diamond suit with 4 honors. |
PG| ***** 211 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another factor is vulnerability. Again, on this hand, that factor favors bidding because you are not vulnerable and the opponents are vulnerable.  A third factor is your overall distribution. You prefer to bid with shapely hands, hands with a singleton or void. That factor is not in North's favor. 6-3-2-2 is the flattest you can be with a 6-card suit. |
PG| ***** 212 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A fourth factor is length in the opponents suit. A void is magic, and a singleton is good. Again, that factor favors not bidding with the North hand. Partner is likely to be short in hearts and passed. So although partner could have a moderate hand, he or she cannot have a good hand.|
PG| ***** 213 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also, there is some possibility that you will set 4@H. You probably have at least 1 diamond trick (voids are rare) and you might get lucky and get 2 diamond tricks. You have at least 1 spade trick and could very easily have 2 spade tricks. |
PG| ***** 214 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the auction, even if partner does not have the @SK, it is more likely to be with West than East. And partner more than likely has a trick (if not, then 5@D is destined to go down too many). So I would say it is far from clear whether or not North should bid 5@D. And that is why 4@H is such a good opening bid.|
pg| ***** 215 ***** |


mb|p|mb|p|sk|w|NT||lb|*bWhat should be the bid?^^p|mb|x|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is not clear whether or not West should double. Whenever they buy the hand and you have a singleton or void in partner's suit, that makes it more likely that you will defeat the hand. You could easily be getting a ruff, and, since you are short, it is more likely both opponents have 2 or even 3 cards in partner's suit and partner will be able to cash some tricks. |
PG| ***** 217 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the singleton heart favors doubling. East also has a club trick. So, it is very possible that 5@D is down 1 off the top, losing a heart, a heart ruff and the @CA. And the spade honors might produce a trick, depending on who has the @SA and @SQ. So double is not unreasonable, but it is certainly possible that 5@D will make.|

up|36|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First let me mention that my recommended bidding is 4@H-P-P-P. But I like to comment on the defense. The defense by East West was very good. After  cashing 2 hearts, East's 3rd heart was high. When giving partner a ruff, the size of the spot you play is a suit preference signal. |
PG| ***** 232 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the high heart signaled East wanted a spade return, the higher of the 2 remaining suits (spades and clubs). In theory, West should now return a low spade, and if she does so, they end up beating the hand 5. East will ruff, return a club, get a second spade ruff, and cash the @CK. |
PG| ***** 233 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That gives the defense 2 heart tricks, 2 club tricks, and 3 trump tricks for down 5. But I think it is reasonable for West to cash the @CA first. Some defenders would signal high on the club, since they have the @CK. But East made the excellent play of Signalling low, because she wanted a spade ruff, not a club back. And down 4 is an excellent result.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me briefly explain about the 1@S bid and how to respond after your RHO has doubled. I play if you don't redouble (or bid 2N which I will explain in a minute) you have less than 10 points. With 10 or more points you must redouble. Failing to redouble denies 10 points. However, most experts play something more complicated which I find very counter intuitive. |
PG| ***** 237 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And that is if they bid on the 1-level over a double that is forcing. It doesn't promise 10 points, but they can bid at the 1 level with 10 points. So 1@D-X-1@S is forcing, and doesn't say anything about how strong you are (other than you have 6+). And they play that 2 level bids are weak and non-forcing. |
PG| ***** 238 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, 1@D-X-2@C is weak, whereas 1@D-X-1@S can be strong I find that very counter intuitive. I try to keep it simple. if my partner does not redouble, they don"t have 10 points. The only other way to show a strong hand is to bid 2N over the double. That is known as Jordan 2N and shows a 4+ card limit raise. So the auction 1x-dbl-2N shows a limit raise after a double.|
PG| ***** 239 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Thus, IMO, 1@S by Gail denies 10 points. 1@S is an ok bid but I can give you an undo if you wish.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a tad aggressive. I should probably be slightly stronger--8-10 or so. But I like to bid :)|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|D|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) opened the BIL on  September 3, 2003 to provide the learner bridge player with a secluded place to attend lessons , mentoring sessions  and hosted practice sessions free from interruptions by the advanced bridge player.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the information became a priority. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features they are an outstanding way to study the game.

The BIL has continued to grow. By March 2013 to avoid the conflicts between the Open Teaching and Practice sessions and the level restricted courses it became necessary to restructure the BIL so that it had two places on BBO to operate from.  

1. In the BBO Public Clubs > BILlies Retreat and
2. a Private Classroom  - LearnBrdge for the level restricted Courses

These together with the Library will give learner bridge players even more opportunities to improve their knowledge and  bridge skills in the future.
