^-|CP||AT|^c@2^Y@3^*BAs is the case against suit contracts, listening to the bidding is essential for success. For example, a lead from K J 8 6 5 should be avoided if an opponent has bid the suit; unless you have a solid sequence such as Q J T 9 6, you will be better off not leading suits bid by the enemy. If the opponents have bid all of the suits (or you have an extremely undesirable holding to lead from in the unbid suit, such as K 4) and you are in doubt, lead through strength, i.e., lead a suit bid by dummy.

2 over 1 is really just a fairly small modification to SAYC. The basic change is over major suit auctions. If responder makes a bid at the 2 level, that shows a game forcing hand as opposed to SAYC, where 2 over 1 only promises an invitational hand.

The principle of "fast arrival" means, once a game force is established, if you jump to game, that shows a weaker hand, than if you go slower. In other words "fast arrival" show a weaker hand than "slow arrival." The idea being, that you want more room to explore for slam, but no need to go slow if you just want to bid game.|

Reasonably easy hand. I have 2 diamond losers and a potential heart loser. Should draw trumps after losing the 2 diamonds. Probably can discard one heart on club provided clubs are not 6-0 and trump the other heart for making 5.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Babs has what Marty Bergen calls "the perfect" preempt. Great distribution, solid suit without the ace, no defensive tricks, not vulnerable. The only minor flaw is the HQ; Bergen prefers no honors outside the long suit. A void is not only ok, it is desirable.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason people don't like to preempt with a void is they feel their hand is too strong. But a preempt is a risk/reward type of bid. It involves a risk. The reward is almost always better than the risk. you are trying to disrupt the opposition, and when you have a weak distributional hand, that tactic works quite often.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You can't have it both ways. Either you believe in preempts or you don't. As most know, I believe in preempts. they have served me well over the years. If I have anything that even resembles a preempt (and some would say even when I have a hand that bears no resemblance to a preempt, lol) I preempt.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In fact, non vul, 1st seat, with Bab's almost perfect preempt, I might open 4@D because when you have the perfect preempt, it is ok to open 1 more. One of recent Marty Bergen's voice |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/596kdx^*N|CP||AT| lessons gives an excellent description of how, when, and how high to preempt for those who are interested. I personally learned a lot from it.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also Kia made a movie of one of the hands from that lesson, so you can see a sample of what Bergen talks about. |CP|1|AT|^*Htinyurl.com/pof3b5f^*N|CP||AT|.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|How, should Marge bid? The general rule is, you need at least an opener to overcall over a preempt. Marge has a marginal opener. She does have 5 spades, but they are relatively weak. They are not horrible, but only 1 honor and a intermediate is not great. Also, her distribution is not wonderful. Hands with voids and singletons are much better than hands with doubletons.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Finally, when you have a marginal overcall, the most important factor that breaks the tie as to whether to bid or not is length in the opps suit If you have a singleton or void, you should favor bidding on marginal hands. If you have 2 or more cards in their suit, you should favor passing.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not saying you should never bid with 2 or more in their suit. I am just saying if you don't have a clear cut opener, you should not. For example, if the auction goes 3@D-P-P-?, and Marge is in 4th seat, that is a different story. |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In that case she has a clear 3@S bid. Balancing seat is very different than direct seat. Partner often has a good hand but no good bid over a preempt. So, if you have a reasonable hand in balancing seat, you should make a bid.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The same thing goes for Kia's hand. It is a marginal direct seat overcall although with the quality spade suit, the nice clubs, no wasted diamond values, and the A 10 of hearts, that is enough for me to overcall even in direct seat. But that is about the weakest hand I would want to have to make a direct seat overcall.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a hard hand to play. I think Kia made the best bid he could even though technically he should have 6 hearts. He wants to play in 4@H if partner has 3 or a nice doubleton. Otherwise partner can pass with a min and bid 3N with a max.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So had Marge passed, I would guess our most likely result is down 1 and down 2 is more likely than making 5. Plus, in duplicate, if they make 5@D, they are probably getting a good result anyway. So by doubling, I at least increase the chances that we get a good result. But I am glad Marge decided to double, which made it easy for me.|mb|p|mb|p|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think 5@D was a very nice bid. Unfortunately because kia has such nice hearts, and the @CK is offside, we don't do well in 4@H. Regardless, 5@D was still a good bid. Some North's being vul, might decide to bid 5@H. And had Kia had a slightly different hand (e.g. switch the KQ of hearts for the ace giving him 1 less HCP) 5 diamonds actually makes. One thing to remember is that you should not be a "results" player.|

^-{    Beginner Intermediate Lounge     }
^-|fp||ht|c|at|^b@2Maureen Hall (hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

- Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players.
- Where beginner and intermediate players could get to meet and practice together. 
-Where those serious about improving could  have one-on-one lessons with a Mentor 

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily,- Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Team Matches, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite and more.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lesson and  help notes became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. 

Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

In 2013 , in order to offer more opportunities for study, the BIL now operates from two sites.  
1. the BILies Retreat in the BBO Public Clubs, where the open teaching and practice sessions and specials event are held. A place for members to bring their non BIL friends.  
2. The LearnBrdge Classroom in the BBO Private Club section where level restricted, pre-registered, topic specific Courses are held

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. |
