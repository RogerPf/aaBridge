^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me count my Bergen Points. 11 HCP, 1 quality suit point, 3 length points for 16. So we are close to slam if Jenny has 2 key cards. slam is likely to be on the club finesse at worst.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Note that, even if you normally play high from 3 small, Liz made the right lead on this hand. When leading partner's unsupported suit, you always lead count. Had Liz supported spades, then she would lead attitude, because by supporting she is saying she has at least 3. But since she did not support spades, it is more important for Don to know how many she has, so she leads low from 3 small.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We were in the right spot. As you can see, if Jenny had the @SA instead of the @SK QJ  (which is one less HCP in fact) we should be in 6. As usual, my HCP only tell part of the story as to how good my hand is. It is about 50% better (e.g. 16 points rather than 11 points) than my HCP indicate. Bergen hand evaluation helps you figure that out.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We should definitely not be in 4. If Jenny had led a spade, or the @D10 had not come down, it only makes 2 or 3 not to mention that the hearts broke very nicely. But the main point is that I planned the hand after the opening lead. I counted my winners and figured out a way to get to 8 tricks, which is what I needed to make 2@H. I know a lot of teachers say you should count losers in a suit contract but I always count winners. to me that makes a lot more sense. It is sometimes difficult to count losers. It is almost always easier to count winners.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|DONT should be used when you have a hand suitable for competing over a 1N opener. I will discuss the exact requirements later. But, in general, if your hand is either somewhat distributional or has some strength, you should compete by making a DONT bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When you bid DONT, with 5-5 you can have as little as 7 or 8 if the points are in your suit. With 5-4 you should have at least 10 or so. But if you have a single suit (for which the DONT bid is double) you need basically a weak 2.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You have to decide what you play after interference over 1NT. Some people play this very complicated convention called Lebensohl.

mb|2H|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I recommend you play "systems on, stolen bid doubles" after interference by the opponents over 1N. That means any bid I make is the same as if there had been no interference and if I double that means Don "stole" my bid (e.g. I would have bid 2@D as a transfer to hearts). So on this hand I bid 2H, which is still a spade transfer.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One major point to this hand was how to handle the club suit, and keep it from being blocked. As a general rule, you play the high cards in the shorter hand first. Almost always, you should play the high cards in the shorter hand first to make sure the suit does not block.|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, once Don leads the @CJ, the @C10 is high. So Liz should play it first before playing her other 2 honors. As you saw, she blocked the suit, meaning she had the @C10 opposite the @CKx. She had 2 good club tricks, but she needed an entry back to her hand to cash the @CK once the @C10 was cashed. |
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Fortunately she had a diamond entry. But had she played the @C10 on the 2nd club trick, it would have been a lot easier to play the hand and there was no harm in playing the @C10 first on the 2nd club trick. |

If they were vul, especially if I were not, I might just pass and hope to beat them several. But being vul, there is too much chance we will miss a game (either 3N or 4S). So I need to make an aggressive bid here. I have no good choices. But 2N seems to be as good as it gets.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good play by Jenny. It is almost never wrong to give declarer a ruff to which he is entitled anyway. At worst it is a passive play (e.g it gives nothing away) and sometimes it prematurely shortens declarer's trumps. So never be afraid to give declarer a ruff if you have nothing better to play. It turns out I have just enough trump, but if I had 1 less, the club play would have been particularly effective.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So my aggressive bidding did not pay off here. Although they don't do that badly in 2@H. They lose only 1 spade and 4 or 5 hearts, it either makes or is down 1. I suspect eventually I will be end played and have to give up a heart trick. So it is possible 2@H will even make. Therefore, my best contract is 3@S. But I decided, particularly since you stretch to bid vul games, that 4@S was a good risk. I would have preferred to have a 4th spade, but 3 spade honors is awfully good support and my partner could have had a 6th spade or at least better spades especially since I knew he was short in hearts.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, another good feature of this hand from my perspective was the location of the heart shortness. I knew Jenny was short in hearts and so was Don. That is good for me: because if Jenny ruffs a heart I can overruff with Don's hand. If the location of the hearts had been reversed, that would have been bad for me. For example, suppose it went 2@H-P-P-? and I held my same hand. Then not only are the long hearts behind my long hearts (which is to my disadvantage) but the short hearts are behind my short hearts. So if I tried to ruff hearts in the North hand, East would be overruffing. On some hands, you have to take into account the position of your suits. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A simpler example is, suppose someone opens 1@S and you are the next bidder and have the @SK. Your @SK is likely to be a good card, as it is likely to be sitting behind the ace. But if you are sitting in front of the spade bidder, then your @SK is likely to be worthless. The same 3 HCP can be worth a lot or a little depending on the bidding and where they are located. You do need to keep that in mind sometimes, particularly when you are deciding whether or not to be aggressive.|

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.|
