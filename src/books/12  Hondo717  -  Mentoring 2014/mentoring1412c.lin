I am not a Christian or a Jew. Honestly I do have no denomination anywhere. However, I never forget the kindness and generosity I have received from many people with different religious affiliation and never asking me mine. In early 1963 an elderly couple in a suburban Barberton, Ohio (not far from Canton, Ohio) stands out in my own world. They were devote Christian and could not care less whether we came from the dark region of the earth from the moon. They gave their love and kindness to a couple newly arrived in USA along with a newborn son. When we had no one in the new world they gave my wife all the comfort she missed by being planted thousands miles away from home. I never forget the old lady's gray hair and her husband's thick eye-glasses|

Recently, by chance I was introduced to the true story of Mr. B. Virdot (Sam Finkelstein born in Romania) a Jewish mysterious benefactor who in the Great Depression, sent gifts to those in need. The news, in past several week, has been all over the National TV and the book "A Secret Gift." has been featured in many major news papers. Next. I have a summary from Los Angeles Times. |CP|1|AT|^*Harticles.latimes.com/2010/nov/07/entertainment/la-ca-ted-gup-20101107^*N|CP||
PG| ***** 2 ***** |

"On DEC. 18, 1933, an ad appeared in the Canton, Ohio, paper offering financial aid for 50 to 75 families to help them have "a merry and joyous Christmas." The benefactor asked simply that the applicants write of their "true circumstances" — and, when the letters arrived, felt compelled to help twice as many. Before Santa arrived, $5 checks from B. Virdot — as the paper noted, a pseudonym — reached 150 people. Virdot's identity remained a secret for 75 years, until his grandson, Ted Gup, opened a suitcase to discover a bankbook and the cache of letters."|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|

"They could hardly have landed in better hands. Gup, a former Washington Post reporter who now chairs the journalism department at Emerson College in Boston, dived into public records to trace what happened to the recipients of his grandfather's generosity-and to their children and grandchildren. When he could, he interviewed the families connected to those long-ago, modest gifts. In telling their stories, the book becomes a portrait of endurance and recovery, as well as of a community in the throes of the Great Depression."|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|

"Before the stock market crash of 1929, Canton was a busy industrial city in, home to Hoover and Republic Steel. But it was knee capped by the Depression, with unemployment running as high as 50%. Local banks failed, taking all the deposits with them. Assistance programs there frequently ran out of food. Malnourished children in homes their parents couldn't afford to heat got sick; some died."|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


AT|

"The devastation hit all levels: the people who received $5 from B. Virdot included a grocer who'd gone broke extending credit to his customers, and a man who lost his family's mansion after putting it up as collateral for the farm machinery business he had inherited."|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


nT|
"The letters, many of which are reproduced in full, are snapshots telling desperate stories they would later downplay or deliberately forget. "We do not own a home here, nor furniture, tho we once did," wrote Edith Saunders. "Recently we were unable to pay any rent for five weeks and were ordered to move." Ora Beggs, who'd been sick after losing a son the year before, explains, "We do have a large Dr. bill at Dr. Maxwell, a hospital bill, grocery at Mr. Brown's on Navarre Rd. The last two I have been paying a dollar on whenever possible. Also owe $16 at Jacobs funeral home yet."|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT|

"The Beggs family moved to the country, where they had no indoor plumbing but could at least raise their own food. Son Don, now in his 80s, remembers getting a paper route — and selling chickens and rabbits to the people who could afford them. The necessary grimness of these true stories is leavened by the long view — the septuagenarians who remember the local amusement park, the boy who grows up to fight bravely in World War II, the grandchildren safe from want."|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


AT|

"In his letter, Howard Sommers detailed the efforts he and his wife made to earn money, including picking wild dandelions and selling them door to door. "Please destroy this letter," he writes, "so no one will know but you & I." That pact of secrecy — between the authors and the anonymous B. Virdot — was key to their frankness."|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


AT|

"In chapters that alternate with the letters and their legacy, Gup weaves the story of B. Virdot. Initially, Gup wanted to understand why his grandfather undertook this singular act of generosity, but he found himself exploring why he invented B. Virdot at all. That exploration led to a stack of secret upon secret, which Gup fans out like a deck of cards."|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


AT|

"B. Virdot, the man Gup knew as Sam Stone, was born Sam Finkelstein in Romania, although he maintained otherwise. Driven by anti-Semitism, the family emigrated to the U.S., landing in Pittsburgh. Apparently to deny the legacy of his abusive father, Sam shed his last name and reinvented himself as man who, eventually, was able to make his way in Canton as a successful businessman. Hampered by the cratering economy and the troubled family he foreswore, Stone's path to success was never assured. "As Sam Stone learned more than once," Gup writes, "the bright line that separated the favored class from those below them could dissolve almost overnight, exposing the fragile divide between the haves and have-nots."|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


AT|

"The letters, Gup writes, "reminded me of the difference between discomfort and misery, between the complaints of consumers forced to rein in their spending and the keening of parents whose children went hungry night after night." They also show that a gesture of generosity can deliver, along with small relief, good fortune that rings with hope."|

|CP||va|4|AT|^b@2^*B46^*N. When leading from the dummy to take a finesse with a number of equal honors in your hand, finesse with the higher or highest equal.|VA|2|AT|
^c@2Say you have the A-Q-J-10 in your hand and x-x in the dummy. When you lead low from dummy and second hand plays low, play the queen. You give away too much information if you play the 10. If the 10 loses to the king, second hand will know you still have the Q-J. If the queen loses to the king, second hand won't know you have the J-10. If the 10 wins, and second hand has the king, second hand knows you still have the Q-J. However, if the queen wins, second hand can't be sure you have the J-10.

^b@2^*B47^*n. When you have all the tricks but one and you are playing in a trump contract, play off every single one of your trump cards before you play your other suits. Keep the suit you have the loser in until the bitter end. Make them suffer!|VA|2|AT|
^c@2Remember, the most you can lose is the last trick.

^b@2^*B48^*n. At a suit contract holding A-x-x facing x-x-x and the suit is led, it is usually right to win the second round of the suit.|VA|2|AT|
^c@2If one of the opponents has a doubleton, you cut the communications between the two hands. It is also right to duck when dummy has x-x and you have A-x-x-(x). Ducking allows you to keep control of the suit. Do the same when dummy has A-x-x-(x) and you have x-x. Take the second trick with the ace. This assumes you have no place to put these losers.

^b@2^*B49^*n. When fortunate enough to have a powerful trump suit and being forced to ruff, tend not to ruff with your lowest trump. That tiny trump might be your only way to get to dummy.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another question is, should Mary bid 2N or 3N. She has 18 HCP. She has a quality 5-card diamond suit. And her points are all very solid, no unprotected queens or jacks. I would say her hand is worth 19 or even close to 20.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Personally I would have bid 3N with her hand. But 2N is acceptable but conservative. It is true that 2N is one of my least favorite contracts. If it makes 3 you did not bid enough usually. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the 2 points there were that a) Faye must accept the invitation. when partner invites and you are on the strong side of the range you have shown, you should accept the invitation. Similarly if it went 1@H-P-2@H-P-3x-p-?, the 2@H bid shows 6-9 so if responder had 8 or 9 they must bid 4@H.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Faye can either play for Judy to have started with doubleton @SKQ (which is what she had) in which case right after the @SA she would play a low spade leaving the @SJ to draw the @S10 or, she could play Mary for the doubleton S10.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In that case, she should play the @SJ, dropping the 10 and Q on the same trick and setting up her 9 to draw the @S7. It is a guess, but those are the 2 plays Faye has. She has to choose 1 of them and hope. Remember, experts are often lucky, but they also make their own luck.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's count Faye's points. It is an interesting question as to whether we should count "Declarer Points" or "Dummy Points." Yes, Faye will end up being declarer on this auction, but "Declarer Points" are counted by the person who has longer trump. And had Mary passed and I bid 1@S, Faye would have raised spades, making her dummy. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So on this auction, Faye should pretend I bid spades first (which I essentially did with my double) and count Dummy Points.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, from my perspective my double was a slight overbid already and I am passing 3@S. 4@S is a viable contract but very hard to play. In fact, let's see how Faye does in 3@S.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NHoward has several tutorials explaining when you should lead trump. However, this short note and a 5-board quiz is a free sample marketing his Quiz Expert program. You can do the quiz yourself using:
|CP|1|AT|^*Hvubridge.com/QM/Users/larryco@larryco.com/TL.php^*N|CP||AT| link. 

However, our is an improved version as MM has used his movie making skill to make it interactive and more instructive.

You guessed it right. MM loves free samples and goes to Costco often for their free samples. However, in Costco, humble pie they serve not.

The Following are additional tutorials from Howard's web site on the topic:

^-|cp|8|fp||

ht|e|at|^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|When should you lead trump? The clearest time is when declarer ends up in his second suit. In other words, the opponents bid:|

HT|g|cs|6|at|{|ia|1s1n2dp3dppp|at|}         @2
|ht|j|at|Dummy will be short in spades and declarer will likely want to ruff spades in dummy. That means you should lead trump.|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


 

ht|m|at|^B@2Also, trump leads against low-level contracts are usually better/safer than attacking leads from honors. However, don't lead trumps from holdings such as Kx, Qxx, Jxx--as it often will cost a trick. Leading trump from Kxx or Axx is usually safe.|
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


AT|

Against games/slams, I generally prefer to avoid trump leads--choosing to attack instead. However, if you have all of the opponents' suits well under control, that could point towards a trump lead.|

In fact, dummy could have 3 hearts and 2 spades (His correct bid is 2@S with something like:
