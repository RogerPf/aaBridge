|CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/5vo9kx^*N
^-|CP||va|4|AT|@2^*B25.^*n In general the lead of a low card shows strength and the lead of a relatively high spot card shows weakness. (See tip ##29)

^*B26.^*n When partner leads low from length and dummy has small cards, third hand plays high. However, if third hand has two or three equal high cards, third hand plays the lower or lowest equal. (From K10x, play the king, from KQx, play the queen, from KQJ(x), play the jack.)

^*B27.^*n When returning the suit partner has led, with two cards remaining return the higher; with three cards remaining, return the lowest. Say partner leads low and dummy has low cards. If you have A-10-5, play the ace and return the 10. If you have A-10-6-5, play the ace and return the 5.

^*B28.^*n When partner leads low from length and dummy comes down with an honor and you have a higher and a lower honor, insert the lower honor if dummy plays low. Say dummy has the Q-5-4 or the J-5-4 and you have K-10-6(x). If dummy plays low, play the 10. Say dummy has the K-7-6 or the Q-7-6 and you have A-J-3(2). If dummy plays low, play the jack.^*N

^*B29.^*N If partner leads a low card in one suit, gets in and shifts to a low card (showing strength) in another suit, partner wants a return in the second suit. If partner shifts to a high card in the second suit (top of nothing perhaps), he is asking for a return in the first suit. Got it?|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A spade lead is reasonable. Let me describe the alternatives as to which spade to lead. Some people would lead low from 4. Some people would lead top of nothing even though they have 4 and some people lead 2nd best (this is known as "2nd and 4th leads") to differentiate eventually between a 3-card suit with nothing and a 4-card suit with nothing.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay a couple of things to discuss. First of all, although it turned out to be wrong, 2nd hand low is almost always right. So Kia should not be chastised too much. For example, Liz played 2nd hand low on the first heart trick and it gained their side an extra heart trick. |
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When in doubt, play 2nd hand low. Too many players erroneously play 2nd hand high when they should not. However, let me explain why in this particular case, however, Kia might decide to play high. If Liz has the ace, it does not matter, and the contract is going down. |
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|E/W already has 2 tricks, and the @CA and @CK are 2 more tricks. And if Liz does not have the @CA but has the @HA then Kia must play the @CK. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case it either does not matter whether Kia plays high or low, or it could cost a trick. That is why 2nd hand high happens to be right on this hand.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now as to whether 4 hearts is a good contract. I have been in worse. It is ok, but not great. Don has 2 sure losers, 1 club and 1 diamond plus a sure heart loser. Therefore, he needs the spade finesse to work and to guess who has the @HJ. So the contract is on 2 finesses, 25%, not a great contract.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you play the auction 1@D-P-2@C establishes a game force let's discuss that. The way Liz plays is the way most people play these days. However, it is not the way I play.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The problem with playing 2@C forcing over 1@D is that, because 1N is not forcing (as it is over 1@H and 1@S) when you have an invitational hand with clubs, you are stuck for a good bid.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is why I prefer not playing it as a game force. but I am in the distinct minority. And this is one of the few areas where Bergen and I disagree.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's change Liz's hand to the following @SAxx @Hxxx @Dxx @CKQJ10x Now what can she bid?|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|She can't bid 2@C because it is not a game force. She cannot bid 1N but her hand is pretty strong. She could bid 2N. But she is a point short (although on this hand her quality club suit makes up for it perhaps). |
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even if she bids 2N she misses describing the club suit, an important feature of her hand. Nevertheless, we will pay it game forcing here as well because that is what most people play.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, if playing 2/1 with a new partner, you should assume 1@D-P-2@C is a game force. But playing with me, assume it is not :).|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once 2@C is a game force, my 2@S bid is not a reverse in the sense that it does not show extra values. Most people play that once a game force is on, you simply "bid out your shape" as opener.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, if 2@C were not a game force, then 2@S would be a reverse and show extra values (and, in fact, establish a game force) and I would have bid 2@S. That would have allowed Liz to know that she should explore for slam. Because if I have 16 or so and she has 16 or so we have enough to look for slam. |
PG| ***** 59 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a hand where you have to think about what Don "did not" bid—the infamous "negative inference" or the dog did not bark."|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


sk||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If Don had a limit raise in spades, he could cue bid 3@C or 3@D to show that. Remember my 2N bid shows clubs and diamonds so 3@C and 3@D by Don are cue bids. Therefore Don has less than a limit raise.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let's count Kia's Declarer Points. He is right, completely discount your @DK on this auction. He has 10 "working" HCP and the @CJ is dubious as well. He can count 15 Declarer Points, if he adds 1 length point, 1 quality suit, 2 points for a singleton, and add 1 for the 4 card side heart. With that few of points and since Don can't have a limit raise, you do not have enough to bid game.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For those who don't know "the dog did not bark" is from a famous Sherlock Holmes story where he solves the mystery because the dog did not bark.

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Negative inferences are very important but are not used by many less experienced players. Most people only think about what partner did bid to figure out what partner has in their hand. But you also have to think about what partner did not bid, as in this case.|mb|p|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Liz made an error at trick 1. Since I bid 2@C, my C8 must be 4th best. Therefore, I must have the @AKTx of clubs. Thus, it was right to play a low club. Then Liz has 2 club stoppers because she wins the first trick with the 9.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I just figured it out using logic. but if you want to use the rule of 11. 11 - 8 (the club I led) = 3. That means there are 3 cards out higher than the 8 in West, North, and East. Liz has all 3 of those cards (the J, Q, and 9 of clubs).|

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
