|CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/5vo9kx^*N
^-|CP||AT|^b@2^*B14^*N. It is dangerous to count extra points for short suits or long suits before the bidding starts. If partner bids your short suit, that reduces, not increases, the value of your hand. If one of your opponents bids your long suit, that decreases, not increases, the value of your hand. If you let the bidding develop, you will see whether your long or short suits are working for or against you.

You hold: @S Axxx @H x @D Qxxxx @C xxx
What is this hand worth? If partner opens 1@H, it is a minus 6-point hand. If partner opens 1@S, it is a 9-point hand (3 points for the singleton with four-card support). [Probably 10--5th diamond.] If LHO opens 1@D and partner overcalls 1@H, the @DQ has lost it's value not to mention the fifth diamond. You are now looking at a minus 4-point hand! Be patient with distributional evaluations until you hear the bidding.

^*B15^*n. It is dangerous to use Blackwood holding a void. If you are missing two aces and partner shows one ace, you won't know which it is. It is usually better to cuebid when interested in a slam. Also, when responding to Blackwood, do not count a void as an ace. With one ace (or three) and a void, jump to the six level of the void suit if it is lower ranking than the trump suit. If the void suit is higher ranking than the trump suit, jump to the six level of the trump suit. With two aces and a void, respond 5NT.

^*B16^*n. When responding to an opening bid with two four-card majors, respond 1@H and give partner a chance to rebid 1@S. If partner doesn't rebid 1@S, assume partner does not have four spades and bid accordingly.
You hold: @S AJxx @H KQxx @D Jx @C xxx
^CPartner ^FYou
^C1@D ^F1@H
^C2@C ^F?
Rebid 2NT and limit your hand to 11-12 HCP. Do not rebid 2@S. Partner does not have four spades.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Jenny should either pass or bid 2@H. Double is certainly wrong as she must have clubs in order to double. This double promises 2 suits which she does not have. further, she has 3-card spade. Personally I think I would pass, but 2@H is feasible. But let us assume it is a correct double.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


sk|s|NT||lb|*bPlease bid for South.^^1n|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am now in a position to make a "free bid." Had Jenny passed, I am forced to bid because a new suit by responder is forcing. But once she doubles I am under no such obligation. I only bid if I have something to say. I could bid 1N to show my balanced 12-14 and stoppers. And that is what I will do. But if I lacked a stopper in the unbid suits I would pass.|mb|1N|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


sk|w|NT||lb|*bPlease bid for West^^2c|mb|p|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West could bid 2@C (assuming that Jenny really had clubs). West does not have a great hand, but the @SA, @HQ, and @CJ (given the auction) are all "working HCP" (the @SJ is probably not worth anything). However, given West has only 7 effective HCP and 4-3-3-3 distribution, always a downgrade, pass is also ok. I probably bid 2@C.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


sk|n|NT||lb|*yCan North bid New Minor Forcing?^^n|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to whether North should bid NMF, the answer is no. You only bid NMF when you have a game invitational hand. South is showing 12-14 so North, with 9 HCP, knows that there is little chance for game. |
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||lb|*bPlease bid for North.^^P,2S|mb|p|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North's 2 choices are pass or 2@S (to play). If we played support redoubles (where a redouble by South over the double promises 3-car spade support) then pass is clear because South is promising exactly 2 spades (and might even have 1 spade if he decided 1NT was the best bid even with a singleton spade).|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But even not playing support redoubles, I would pass with the North hand because some of the time South would bid 2@S with good 3-card support. Therefore it is less likely North/South have an 8-card fit, and 1NT is likely to be a better contract (and 1 trick less) than playing 2@S on  what is likely to be no more than a 7-card fit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me comment more about the double. Jenny definitely does NOT have a takeout double. A takeout double promises the unbid suits. And when there are only 2 unbid suits, it promises 4 cards in the unbid suits. A takeout double does not simply promise an opening hand or points.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In fact, it is more important when you make a takeout double that you have the correct shape. When there are 3 unbid suits, you must have at least 3 card support in all of the unbid suits.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if there is only 1 unbid major, almost all the time you should have exactly 4 cards in the unbid major. When there are 2 unbid majors it is ok to be 4-3. You should not have a 5-card major and make a takeout double.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So there are 2 strikes against a takeout double:
^Ca) since there are only 2 unbid suits, she does not have at least 4 cards in both unbid suits—only 2 clubs.
^C b) she has a 5-card major.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With her flat hand, being vul, I would probably pass with her hand. But if I chose to bid, 2@H is clearly the best bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here I have 2 choices. 1@S or 1N. You can make an argument for either. In general I think you should bid or overcall 1NT whenever you can  even with a 5-card major. There is no reason that you cannot overcall 1N with 5-card major. |
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, when overcalling it is a little different. There you expect the opponents to compete so taking charge of the spade suit is often a good tactic. But since I have such a strong 1NT bid, I will bid it. However, 1@S could be just as good.|

PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over a doubled 1N, when the double is for penalty, transfers are off. The reason is, you often want to play in 2@C or 2@D. So no Stayman, no transfers. Your goal is to find your best partial. The bidding in DONT Runouts work as follows:|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With a hand you want to play in 1 suit, you (Don in this hand) redouble.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


AT| I bid 2@C and then Don passes with clubs or bids his suit.|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case Don would redouble, I would bid 2@C and he would bid 2@H.|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you have two 4-card suits but no 5-card suit then you bid the lower of your suits. That is a DONT-like bid. It shows the suit bid and a higher suit. For example, if Don has 4 diamonds and 4 hearts, he would bid 2@D showing diamonds and a major. Just like with regular DONT, I would pass with 3+ diamonds.|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand after Don's 2@D I bid 2@H with a doubleton diamond (or if I had a hand that would play better in either 2@H or 2@S than 2@D)|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, DONT Runouts apply any time partner opens or overcalls 1NT (showing a strong NT) and the next person doubles. So had Jenny passed, and I opened 1N, and MM doubled, DONT Runouts still would be on. Personally I play them even when the double is conventional (such as a DONT double showing a single suited hand), but you can decide only to play them when the double is penalty.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A couple of other comments on the bidding. MM's double, although tenable (MM: In Howard's style ^*Btenable^*N has a lower level than ^*Bmerit^*N -:).), is a little light. You really like to have 9 or a good 8. with a "quacky" 8 pass might be better.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And a convention that I play with my expert partners, that almost no one else plays (but it was recommended by Marty Bergen) is "delayed DONT." I play that DONT applies over any 1NT bid, whether it is an opener, overcall, or even a 1NT response. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I am a passed hand, even if partner has bid  so I would play that any bid by West is still a DONT bid (since west has not bid yet and I bid 1NT). So double would be a single suited hand, and suits would be that suit and a higher suit. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Don although I believe in leading "4th from longest and strongest" that only applies to unbid suits. In this case there is only 1 unbid suit. Best you lead it. It is almost never right to lead a suit the opponents have bid. It is very unusual that you would lead a doubleton against NT, but this is such a case.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't mind ducking aces when there is a reason, but too often players do "practice" ducks. Usually you duck to cut off communications. So for example if East had a doubleton club, Don would have a good reason to duck so that Liz would have to play another suit to get back to her hand. But that did not apply here.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some of you might be wondering about the 2NT bid by Liz. But I like it. There is a very good chance she will get 5 club tricks. Even with Jenny having the club void, if clubs are split 4-3 (around 60%) Liz will take 5 club tricks or if the 9 is singleton.|

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
