^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The auction was fine. It turns out the hand cannot be made, but let's talk about the best line of play. Gail can count 8 sure tricks--4 clubs, 1 spade, 2 diamonds and 1 heart. She also can figure out she only has 3 spade losers, because Babs started with 3 spades, so they are split 4-3. Therefore, the best line of play is to hope for 2 heart tricks hoping that South has the @HA.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There really is no other choice because if she tries to set up a 2nd diamond, she will probably end up losing 5  tricks -- 3 spades, 1 diamond, and 1 heart. Therefore, the best play is to lead a heart towards dummy. That turns out not to work on this hand, but at least you give yourself a 50% chance.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am a big believer in 4th from your longest and strongest in NT. But I also believe it is usually wrong to lead a suit the opponents have bid. In this auction it is certainly possible Dave only has 3 diamonds. However, since Gail bid 1N, I know she is somewhat short in the majors and longer in the minors. Therefore, in this case, I think leading a diamond is probably leading one of their suits. So I will pick my strongest major suit holding.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Again if Gail counts her tricks, she sees 1 heart 2 spades, 2 diamonds and 3 clubs for sure. That's a total of 8. So her best shot is to pick up the diamond suit for her 9th trick. which is what she did.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I had a question as to whether Dave should bid 2N or 3N.  I think with 18 and a 5 card suit 3N is the better bid in IMPs. Its true pard may only have 6 and you might be a point short, but playing 3N has a lot of upside. |
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Playing 2N is only right if you make exactly 2N. In IMPs if you make 3 then you missed a game. And if you go down in 2N, the extra undertrick at 3 is not that important in IMPs. In Match Points its a bit more complicated. In Match Points you need not bid close games because the game bonus per se is not worth that much extra. With Dave's hand one might only bid 2N at Match Points, although I personally bid 3.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand is much better than its simple HCP indicate. especially now that we have found a fit. The bad news is we only have an 8 card fit (because with a 9 card fit Dave would have made a Bergen Raise). But the good news is we have a fit. Let's count my Declarer Points.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|13 HCP, 2 length points gives me 15. Once we find a fit, I can add 2 for the singleton and 1 for the side diamond suit for 18. Dave has 6-9. So we have 24-27. I cannot bid game directly but I can make an invitational bid.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are a whole bunch of conventional invites when it goes 1x-P-2x, but I think the easiest is to just bid a suit where you have some strength.|mb|3D|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The whole hand comes down to not losing 3 spade tricks. Although it happens to not work on this hand, the best play is to hope Gail has either the @SQ or @SJ or a doubleton ace. The odds of losing 3 spade tricks are probably under 20%. Also had I gotten any lead except a heart, I would have been able to pitch my losing heart on a club, and then would even have been able to lose 3 spade tricks.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes you were right to duck. As a general rule, you should not ruff with a natural trump trick. The only time you should is if you are in a rush to cash some tricks before declarer discards losers. |
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But it is virtually never right to ruff with a natural trump trick. In fact, if declarer ruffs, and you can overruff with a natural trump trick, even then you should not because often by not ruffing you set up an additional trump trick for yourself and your trump trick is never disappearing.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Dave's best bid was double. with the same hand and a diamond stopper, 1N would have been reasonable. Regardless you cannot let them play at 1 level so without the diamond stopper double seems better. one thing to remember, regarding why Babs can bid 2@C. Once you have limited your hand, as Babs did by passing, you can then bid a lot more, because partner will know that you don't have much.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NWith Howard's help we are going to make this board a great learning tool. We have removed the other three hands so you cannot peek. As you can see South opened 1@S followed by 2@H  overcall by West. Now you as North are on the hot seat and have to answer several questions. Please note that relevant tutorials are available in the Tutorials section.|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2H|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


NT||lb|*yYou are playing Bergen Raises after interference. Would that apply here? ^^n|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Bergen Raises are off on this auction. In general, they are off in competition, unless you play the Howard style of their being on over a takeout double and overcalls of 1@S and 2@C. But even then, they do not apply over a 2@H overcall. However, weak jump raises are on in competition, regardless of whether or not you play Bergen Raises. So 1@S-2@H-3@S shows 4 spades with less than a limit raise. To show a limit raise you bid 3@H. |
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


NT||lb|*mYou have 4-card support and 5 HCP with a 4-3-3-3 distribution. Which action is more appealing?^Pass~Bid 2S~Bid 3S~Call a Friend^2|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this particular hand, North has a choice of 3 bids -- pass, 2@S, and 3@S. By LOTT, she can bid 3@S. However, because she only has 5 HCP and is 4-3-3-3 I would downgrade her hand and recommend bidding 2@S. With a known 9-card fit, pass is too conservative. So my first choice is 2@S, my second choice is 3@S, and pass is a distant 3rd choice.|mb|2s|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a classic hand for setting up an end play. You have 2 diamond losers and 1 heart loser. In order to make the hand, you have to lose no clubs. Fortunately, your club holding allows you to finesse either person for the @CQ. So many players would simply decide which defender they want to play for the @CQ and finesse accordingly. That gives you a 50% chance of making the hand.|
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, there is a 100% line. If you can get the opponents to lead clubs, you eliminate the guess. So what you have to do is eliminate all of the red cards from both the North and South hands and throw in the defense. The defense will then be forced to either lead a club, which eliminates the guess for you, or lead a red suit, in which case you throw a club from one hand and ruff in the other hand, eliminating the club loser.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's first talk about whether or not Babs should have transferred. It is true that with a weak hand, you are almost always better off in the weak hand's long suit because then the long suit will take some extra tricks without your needing entries to run the suit. That is why, with long spades or long hearts, you always transfer over a 1N opener, even with a weak hand. |
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, the problem with transferring to a minor is you are forced to play at the 3 level. Therefore, the question is, are you more likely to take 9 tricks in the minor or 7 tricks at NT and which is likely to do down less. That is not always an easy question to answer. In this case, I agree with Babs decision to transfer because she has a 6 card suit and 0 HCP. |
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So it is very unlikely Dave can make 1N. And if Dave happens to have 3 (or even 4) nice clubs, 3@C might have plays. On the other hand, in general, I find people transfer too much to 3 of a minor to play even with a 6 card suit, with 4-7 HCP, you are almost always better off.|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play Dave can give himself more chances. At the very least, he can lead low towards his @CK hoping Gail has the @CA. He does have diamond ruffs to get to dummy. He can also just duck the first heart, win the 2nd heart, and ruff 2 hearts in his hand because he has some reasonable spots. So I think with a different line of play, 3@C will make.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NDo you know what the 3@S bid means? If your answer is affirmative then there is no bonus for you. However, I did not know and had to ask Howard for help. And his answer is a bonus for me and probably most of you. Let us read his explanation.|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@S by me is Stayman. Assuming you are not playing Lebensohl (where 2NT has a conventional meaning), all the bids between 2N and 3N are natural, except for the cue bid of 3@S. 3@S is (game forcing obviously) Stayman and shows 4 hearts. With 5+ hearts you can bid 3@H over 2@S. You are hoping partner will bid 4@H or 3N but suppose he can do neither (he has neither 4 hearts nor a spade stopper). Then you must be prepared for partner to bid 4C or 4D over 3S and know what you are going to do.|

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|1|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
