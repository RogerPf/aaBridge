In 2010, four teachers in the Beginner/Intermediate Lounge (BIL) came together to develop a program for those aspiring to learn the game.  With the hard work and support of Maureen Hall, Founder and Manager of the BIL, they developed the four courses of the Beginning Bridge Program—64 hours of intense, interactive learning.|

Maureen has devoted much of her life during the past 10 years toward providing a ‘safe haven’ of learning opportunities for beginning and intermediate bridge players. Because of her endless effort, many BILies become excellent players not to mention lifelong friends.|

In the 2011 segment of the Beginning Bridge Program, a group of students formed a team they called the “Kings and Queens.”  Nearly three years later the original Kings and Queens and several BIL friends they made along the way are meeting in Las Vegas for the summer 2014 NABC, one flying in as far as the UK.|

mb|p|lb|*yIs there another acceptable bid for South^^y|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|The South hand does meet the distribution requirements of a DONT bid. Also, North/South are not vulnerable. And the heart suit is quite nice. However  the diamond suit is quite weak. So, I would reluctantly pass with the South hand. If I decided to bid anything, I would double, showing a single suited hand. The heart suit is not 6-cards but it is a quality suit with good intermediates (the @H8 and even the @H7) so it is a very good 5-card suit. |
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|If you play one of the DONT variations, where 2@H shows a single suited heart hand (in the variations there is another bid to show the 2-suited major hand), that makes a 2@H bid even a little better on this hand because it is somewhat preemptive. But, as I said, I would probably reluctantly pass with the South hand. |

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|If you are not sure what suit to lead, based on the auction, (e.g. partner has bid a suit, or there is only 1 unbid suit) you tend to try and make a neutral lead. Your best lead is always an honor sequence. But failing that, your most neutral lead is from your longest suit where you have no honors. On this hand a diamond lead is probably South's best lead, as no other suit seems better.|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|The 3 things we learned on this hand:

a) leading a singleton trump is to be avoided unless a trump lead is absolutely called for or all other suits are worse. It often tends to give away a trick. The most neutral lead you can make against a suit contract is from your longest suit with no honors.

b) The Law of Total Tricks should be your guide in how high to bid.

c) Try and count out the important suits when you are on defense.|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|In that case, you probably have a 9 card fit. So 3@D is the indicated bid using the Law of Total Tricks. The Law of Total Tricks is a very good guide on competitive hands. It means you should never be afraid to bid to the level equal to your number of trump. With a  9 card fit, it is ok to bid to contract for 9 tricks (e.g. bid to the 3-level).|

I am kind of neutral about responsive doubles. Not suggesting you play them, just explaining how they might work on this hand. However, even on this hand, South has no way of knowing that North has 5 clubs, so South would probably just bid 2@S over 2@D.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Many play "Systems On-Stolen Bid Doubles" which means a double by North would mean that North intended to bid 2@S (minor suit transfer). Since, if you play stolen bid doubles, a double by North is a minor suit transfer, there is no way for North to make a penalty double. That is one of the reasons many experts play Lebensohl after interference over 1NT. |

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|However, Lebensohl is a very complicated convention, so I recommend. for all but my most advanced students, that they play systems on/stolen bid doubles. This approach works fine most of the time and is less likely to result in bidding misunderstandings.

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Very nice bidding Angie. The major point on this hand is for Angie to count her tricks. You should always try and plan a hand out before you play to the first trick. And the best way to start the planing process is to count your winners. I know some teachers say in suits you should count your losers. But I find, as do many experts, that counting your winners is easier and more effective. I am not sure why people are taught to count losers.|

Slam hands in particular are usually pretty easy to plan, because you have loads of winners.|

PG| ***** 93 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, some people are worried about their being able to make 6N. In general, playing in a suit in slam is almost always safer than playing in NT, although not on this hand as it turns out. When playing IMPs, it makes no difference whether they play in 6@H or 6N. The IMP score is exactly the same. And since we are practicing for a team game, we are worried about the best IMP bidding.|
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, NT is vastly overrated by most players who play Match Points. Yes, sometimes you can make the same number of tricks in NT and a suit. But quite often you can take one more trick in a suit than in NT. And, when you bid slam, you rate to get an average plus board regardless.|
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, especially when bidding slams, you should prefer a suit slam when you have a fit to bidding 6N. It is almost always safer and easier to play. That is particularly true in IMPs, but is even true in Match Points. Having said that, it is true in both IMPs and Match Points, that it is almost always better to play 3NT than 5 of a minor.|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Just a minute Angie. A diamond may be right but but who do you think has the SQ?. Or look at it this way. East discarded the @S10. If East had the Q10 of spades, why would East discard a spade. He would take the finesse. These are the kind of inferences you should draw on defense. You should be pretty sure your partner has the @SQ and a spade lead is safe. Not saying you should necessarily lead a spade.|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|So the pass worked out well. Should East open 2@H?|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


AT| Absolutely. Once in a while you will go down a little too much, but more often you will make it hard for the opponents. Preempting is a risk/reward bid. There is some risk, but the rewards in the long run far outweigh the risk.|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Now should Angie pass?|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


AT| Well, it turns out Angie was smarter then me :). Despite the 4 hearts, I would not pass. I would bid 3N. Since Angie is 4-3-3-3, a ruff is somewhat unlikely. So my bid would have been 3N. I would not consider 2N. Yes, she only has 11 points but partner should have a solid opener for making the double.|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|And the rewards for making 3N are high, especially in IMPs. IMO, Angie's 2 choices, are pass or 3N. It does turn out that had Angie bid 2N her  partner would have bid 3.|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Now, what should Bernean bid over 2@H?|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


AT| I would have bid 2N with her hand. Whenever you have the opportunity to open or overcall a natural NT you should do so. Because NT openers and overcalls are such precise bids in terms of both HCP and distribution. You usually have your most accurate auctions when you overcall NT.|
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Additionally, unlike when opening 1NT, where you might lack a stopper in a suit or 2, when you overcall NT you should have a stopper in whatever suit the opp opened. So if Bernean had a balanced 15-18 but no heart stopper, then 2N would not be correct.|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Well played Mark particularly the spades. His play was best because it might clarify the spade suit. Bernean could easily have a doubleton honor although it turns out not to matter. Next a few comments about the play.|
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Angie, you heard mark bid 2@S, so you must keep all your spades because you know he has a 4-card suit. Yes, dummy has 4 hearts and might be able to run hearts if you pitch a heart, but you have to hope partner can stop hearts. On the other hand, you know for sure declarer has 4 spades and if you pitch a spade you will be setting up the 4th spade.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Remember, the auction often gives you clues about how to defend. You should try and take advantage of those clues when you can. Many players forget about the auction once the play starts. That is a big mistake. Remembering the auction often provides critical clues as to how to best play and defend. Next I will comment on the bidding.|
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Bernean has a perfectly reasonable 2@C bid and many players would bid 2@C. But I am trying to teach you to be better than average :). Let me explain why I think there are better alternatives. |
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Some people suggested you are strong enough to double and correct. They are technically correct, but I will explain why I don't think that is the best action. In fact, I think it is not as good an alternative as 2@C.|
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Once partner passes, it is unlikely your side can make 5@C. So why not just get your clubs in right away, bid 3@C, so at least if partner is on lead she will know what to lead. I suggest you should bid 3@C with your hand. Your partner is a passed hand, therefore, you want to be as obstructive as possible.|
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|From your perspective, they could easily have a major suit fit, especially spades, but possibly even hearts. So, given your partner passed, it is right to preempt. It is the same reasoning as why you should sometimes open a preempt in 3rd seat even if you have a real 1-level opener. You are unlikely to be missing game. |
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|There is no harm in partner thinking you are slightly weaker than you are. As long as you both use the law of total tricks to decide how to bid, preempting after partner passes, even with a minimum opener, is often a good tactic. Some people are concerned that if you preempt with a strong hand that should be alertable.|
PG| ***** 162 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|But it is not alertable. so long as your agreement is that it shows a weak hand, you can preempt with a strong hand so long as partner assumes you have a weak hand. In fact, most experts will use the tactic of preempting even with opening hands when they have a long suit and partner has passed. It is a well understood tactic.|
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|On another point, when partner opens 1 of a minor and later rebids a major (as on this hand), it is virtually certain they only have a 4-card suit in the major. It is important to keep that in mind. Yes, very rarely they will have a 5-card major and 6-card minor, but that happens so infrequently that it is not worth worrying about.|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, always assume when partner opens a minor and rebids a major, the major is 4 cards. You will be right 99% of the time, and if you are not right, partner will let you know anyway.|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss their 2@D opener. That is a very interesting convention which has a lot of merit. If I were not so infatuated with opening Weak- Twos :), I might even play it. Basically it shows 11-15 HCP and a 3 suited hand 4-4-4-1 or 5-4-4-0. Partner can now often figure out what to do. If he bids a suit, that is to play, unless it is opener's short suit, in which case they bid the next suit up. If they bid 2N, they want to know what your short suit is, as on this hand.|

The origin of the Mini Roman Two Diamonds is unknown. The concept is closely related to the concept of the Roman Two Diamonds conventional method and should be studied together with this concept. The Roman Two Diamonds conventional method promises a three suited holding with a distribution of 4-4-4-1 or 5-4-4-0 and generally 17 plus high card points. The general consensus is a point range between 17-20 high card points, but many partnerships have increased this range to 17-24 high card points.|
PG| ***** 186 ***** |


AT|

Employing the Mini Roman Two Diamonds conventional method, the distribution is the same, 4-4-4-1 or 5-4-4-0, but the general point range is between 12-16 high card points, with some partnerships using the range between 11-15 high card points. In both cases the shortage can be in any suit.|
PG| ***** 187 ***** |


AT|

The application of the Mini Roman Two Diamonds conventional method requires the partnership to surrender the employment of the Weak-Two Preempts on the two level in Diamonds. The user should also be reminded that the application may only be used with two distributional patterns: 4-4-4-1 or 5-4-4-0, which many players consider limiting.|
PG| ***** 188 ***** |


AT|

The responder of both the Roman Two Diamonds or a Mini Roman Two Diamonds opening will seldom pass this opening of partner since the shortage may be in the Diamond suit. The opening of Two Diamonds neither promises Diamonds nor does it promise a Diamond shortage. Several examples follow, which should be opened with two Diamonds when employing the Mini-Roman Two Diamonds conventional method.|

^-|ht|d|cp||fp||at|^B@2As soon as the responder is aware that the partner has a distribution of 4-4-4-1 or 5-4-4-0, and somewhere between the agreed upon point range of 11/12-15/16 high card points, then the responder and partner will use the so-called Pass And Correct concept. This means only that the responder, being unable to pass the 2@D will bid up the line naturally, which at the same time shows no game interest. The first response is deemed to be natural and the opener will either Pass if it does not name his shortage or Correct if the bid does name his shortage. The following examples should clarify this Pass or Correct method:|

This response requires from the partner only one thing and that is to name the location of his/her shortage. The following example should clarify this action:|
