^-|CP||AT|^c@2^Y@3^*NAny suit headed by 4 honors should be treated as if it is one card longer than it actually is. So when I look at my spades, I think of  A K J 10 as the equivalent of a 5-card suit.

2N after a weak 2-bid is natural and and does not show a 5-5 hand.

The right way to define a 3-level cue bid of opener's major, when he opens a weak 2-bid, is as a stopper ask for 3NT rather than Michaels. To show a strong Michaels type hand, you jump to 4 of your minor.

When your opponent opens 4@H and you bid 4N to show a 2-suited hand, it is logical that you don't have spades. If you did, you could have bid 4@S. But when the opponent opens 4@S, there is no suit you can show at the 4-level. So 4NT should be defined as showing any 2 of the 3 unbid suits.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, I would have bid 3N with Babs hand, but she is smarter than me. I let 2N stand so can discuss it. I also wanted to show off why I think you should just about always lead 4th best of an unbid suit against a NT contract, even if leading away from an AQ or KJ or something like. Many experts disagree with me, but I am quite confident that it works well for me.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss the 2N opener. I have no objection in general to opening 2N with a singleton A or K if you have 20-21. But it is usually better to do it when your long suit is a minor rather than a major. If Kia had the same hand but his long suits were clubs and diamonds it would have been a very reasonable call. But with the majors there is a good possibility that 4 of a major is your best spot, so on this particular hand I think 1@H is the best bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Pass is probably best with Gail's hand but 3N should be considered. If the opps open a weak 2, and partner overcalls a minor, if you have the opps suit stopped and a good 10 or more, 3N will work out more often than not. Bergen's most recent audio lesson "How To Survive An Opponent's Preempt" is one of the best lessons and addresses this issue—|CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/596kdx^*N|CP||AT|.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It should be a solid opener probably 14 starting points. Here with shortness in hearts it could be a little less. Basically, on close hands, over a preempt, the tie breaker is shortness in the opps suit.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you are short (singleton or void)  you should want to bid and not let them play in their suit. If you are longer in their suit, you need to be stronger to bid. The problem in general with preempts (and that is why they are so effective) is you have to make educated guesses.|mb|p|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding was fine but Kia made an error in playing the spade suit—trick 5. There is no reason to finesse the @SJ as he only has 1 spade loser if he plays the @SK and he has no useful pitches even if the finesse works. He can count 4 losers, 1 spade, 2 clubs (1 if he is lucky) and 1 diamond.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That's an interesting point. Normally you do what Kia did on opening lead, and play the honors from the short hand first as well as 2nd hand low. But with limited dummy entries, he might want to take the @HK right away and lead a club to draw trumps ASAP. That is slightly better than what he did. But the big problem was the spade play.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You know we likely have an 8 card fit and based on your diamond length, you also know I am short in diamonds. I may have at most a singleton. So although you are not sure we have more than an 8-card fit, and LOTT says 3@H is an overbid, you can use my competitive guidelines and bid 3@H knowing that I have diamond shortness. My competitive guidelines says  it is ok to bid 3 over 3 with an 8-card fit when someone is short in the opps suit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With my diamond void I suspect 4@H would be a reasonable bid, but I am not sure I would be happy if they bid 5@D so I am passing reluctantly. BTW Babs should probably pass 3@H.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|
Well Gail, here is how you figure out whether or not to bid. As usual, you use the LOTT when you don't know for sure if Babs has 4 diamonds. But when you are not sure, if partner opens 1 of a minor, and you have to make a competitive decision based on LOTT you should assume partner has 4. 80+% of the time that will be true. So by LOTT you have a 9 card fit and a 3@D bid.|

foxyausy:   Howard question on LOTT   ... this is where I don't know how to recognize LOTT for competitive bid versus strength... can you help... is strength shown via cue bid of opps two suits to show diff strengths?|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, you cue bid to show strength, so you could bid 3@C to show a diamond limit raise since I "bid" clubs by bidding 2N. And 3D should be competitive and less than a limit raise.|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You are correct Babs. Not sure how we do in 3@H, but again, use the LOTT to make your bidding decisions on competitive hands. If you play diamonds I run out of trump pretty quickly and I end up taking 5 hearts and the @SA for down 3. But I may do a bit better, but not better than +200. Even if I make 3H we did better by setting 4@D two.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Just remember in competitive auctions, HCP are not nearly as important as distribution. Use LOTT.|

^-{    Beginner Intermediate Lounge     }
^-|fp||ht|c|at|^b@2Maureen Hall (hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

- Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players.
- Where beginner and intermediate players could get to meet and practice together. 
-Where those serious about improving could  have one-on-one lessons with a Mentor 

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily,- Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Team Matches, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite and more.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lesson and  help notes became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. 

Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

In 2013 , in order to offer more opportunities for study, the BIL now operates from two sites.  
1. the BILies Retreat in the BBO Public Clubs, where the open teaching and practice sessions and specials event are held. A place for members to bring their non BIL friends.  
2. The LearnBrdge Classroom in the BBO Private Club section where level restricted, pre-registered, topic specific Courses are held

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
