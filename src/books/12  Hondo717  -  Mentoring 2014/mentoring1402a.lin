^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not sure. Let's say if you pass, Babs bids 1N and I bid 4@H which end the auction.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I could also open 2@C. if you use the Bergen "4 and 4" rule, I have 4 losers (1Heart, 2 Spades, 1 Club) and 4 quick tricks (@HAK @CAK). The problem is, opening 2@C with 2 suiters especially when you don't have a lot of HCP takes away a lot of bidding room. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And even if I open 2@C not sure we get to 6. 6@H is a pretty good contract. I just need to pick up either spades or clubs for no losers.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have to decide what to do. I have some information based on the auction. Gary is a passed hand and Kia preempted. On average they will have about 15 or 16 points between them. That gives Babs on average around 5 or 6 points.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|She didn't raise my hearts, but she might not raise even with 3 with only 5 or 6 points. I could be conservative and bid 3@H. However, my suit almost meets the "singleton" test, that is it plays for 1 loser opposite a singleton. If Babs even has something like the singleton 9 my heart suit is good. So I will bid 4@H because I am vul. It could work out badly, but the risk is wroth the reward.|mb|4H|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Whenever you make a high risk bid, make sure the reward is worth it. Had Gary not passed, I would have only bid 3H, but because he did pass I have  extra information that 4@H is more likely to work out.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So most players other than experts would go down on that hand because of the bad heart break. But based on clues in the auction you can give yourself extra chances. Of course had Kia cooperatively led a club (I would have--I play the @CJ) then all my club losers go away. And then I wouldn't have had to do all that fancy footwork :).|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|DONT is one of the best conventions around. It has earned me many good boards. Many people are afraid to compete over 1N, but they shouldn't be. Giving the opponents free reign when they open 1NT is losing bridge. |
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1NT is one of the best bids you can make. Whenever you or your partner open 1N, that gives you the greatest likelihood that you will end up in a good contract. So as an opponent, whenever you hear 1NT, you should do what you can to disrupt the bidding and at least make your opponents work.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT|^B@2
BabsG (Babs):  I didn't think I had enough points vul.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Despite the vulnerability, I would have bid 2@C with your hand. You have 2 quality suits (4+ card suits with 3 honors) and she has a singleton. The hand is worth 12 bergen starting points, more than enough to compete.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT|^B@2
magicgary:  Would the DONT bid have been better from west behind you.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Regardless, whenever it goes 1N-P-P-? you should strain to compete. In fact, it may be counter intuitive, but the weaker you are the more you want to compete. Why is that? because, the points are approximately evenly distributed. So if you have few points, your partner has most of the points for your side. |
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Moreover, if you have a strong hand in 4th seat, you should worry more about competing because your points are poorly positioned behind the NT bidder. I am not saying you should not compete with a good hand, but you should be more worried than if you have a bad hand, which I know sounds odd. |
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, I prefer DONT to natural, because it lets you bid on more hands, but anything that competes is better than not competing.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As most of you know, I strongly believe you should open 1NT with a 5 card major if you have 5-3-3-2 with 15-17 and the more I play, the more strongly I believe it. Besides the fact that you have real rebid problems if you open 1 of a major with 15-17 it turns out, as I said on a previous hand, your side does its most accurate bidding when 1NT is opened. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So always open 1N if your hand meets the requirements. You may occasionally miss a 5-3 fit, but most of the time NT will play just as well anyway. sometimes better. However, please note that 2 small doubletons do not "meet the requirements." A 1NT bid is 15-17 with 4-3-3-3, 4-4-3-2, or 5-3-3-2 distribution.|mb|1N|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even on this hand, 1N worked out ok despite the 8 card fit. If I open 1@H, Gary will bid 2@H, and I will make some sort of invitation (probably 3@D) and Gary might very well accept and we would be in 4@H in no time.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Then on an opening club lead, I will probably lose 2 spades, 1 heart and 1 club at least. And best defense against 1N can hold us to 1 if Babs leads a spade and I guess wrong. But 1N worked out ok, at least as well as opening 1@H despite our 8 card fit. So bottom line is, open 1N whenever you have 15-17 balanced even with 5-card major. |

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|1|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
