|CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/5vo9kx^*N
^-|CP||va|4|AT|^b@2^*B17^*n. When the opponents bid and support each other and you have the jack or queen of their suit, do not count points for those honors. They are not worth the cardboard they are printed on. Secondary honors may take tricks on defense, but seldom do when you are the declarer.

^*B18^*n. When all your honor cards are in your two long suits, add 1 extra 'purity' point.
You hold: @S AKJxx @H KQxx @D xx @C xx
All your high-card points are in your two long suits, so add 1 extra point to your hand. Think of having 14 points. If partner supports spades or hearts, your hand increases in value. If partner does not have support for either suit, your hand stays at 14 points. Hands that have eight-card fits or longer add extra distributional points. Until the fit is uncovered, distributional points should not be added. It doesn't make sense. Hands that are misfitted should not add extra points, they should subtract points!

^*B19^*n. When RHO uses Stayman and you, fourth hand, have five clubs or six clubs headed by three of the top five honors, double to alert your partner you want a club lead against any eventual contract. A double of an artificial bid is a lead directing double.

You hold: @S xxx @H xx @D xxx @C AKJxx
^CWest ^ENorth ^GEast ^ISouth
^C1NT ^EPass ^G2@C ^I?
Double. You want a club lead against any eventual contract the opponents may land in. Do not double with club length (Kxxxxx) unless you have the necessary honor strength.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Playing a @C10 was fine. Remember it is almost never wrong to make declarer ruff. It is at worst neutral and in this case it makes her dangerously low in trump. By playing a club on this hand note that don ended up getting a trump trick.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although it worked out well, leading away from a KJ normally is very dangerous and will often give away a trick.

NT|^B@2
Liz111:  Do you count the 5th card (my diamond) for 1 pt, if considering a 2NT open?  I play 20-21 pts.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is an excellent question. Liz had 19 points and a 5-card suit, so her hand counts as 20 Starting Points using Bergen hand evaluation.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would not object if she chose to open 2N. I would not, but Bergen himself would. Opening and rebidding NT are the only hands where I tend to be more of a HCP counter than a pure Bergen hand evaluator.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I count my HCP along with count my Bergen starting points. If my Bergen Starting Points are the same as my HCP or only off by 1, I use my HCP to decide how much my hand is worth in NT.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, if I have 14 HCP and 15 starting points, I would still open 1 of a suit rather than 1NT. But if the difference is 2, then I add an extra point for my NT count. So if I had for example 14 HCP but 16 Bergen Starting points, then I would treat that hand as 15 "NT" points and open 1NT.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|To open 2N I need either 20 HCP or 21 Bergen Starting points. That is my rule. A bit complicated but works for me. I think Bergen is slightly optimistic regarding NT openers.|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case Jenny has 20 starting points (add 1 for the 5th diamond). Using my style, that is not enough to open 2N (she would need 21 Bergen starting points). But Bergen would not object to Jenny opening 2NT.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One comment on the bidding. Some people might be hesitant to overcall 1NT with Liz's hand because of no heart stopper. But they should not hesitate. Without a stopper in the opponent's suit, 1N would be problematical. So if Liz had a small doubleton diamond then 1N would be risky.|
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But anytime you have 15-18 balanced and a stopper in opener's suit, you should overcall 1NT. As I often say, when you open or overcall 1NT, that almost always leads to very accurate bidding by your side because 1NT is probably the most descriptive bid you can make.|

For the losers, looking at our hand only, we have 2 spades,|HC|S86|

PG| ***** 120 ***** |


AT| so ZERO hearts loser. |

We cannot trump spades in dummy. But we can dump a Spade loser on the Clubs, once we establish them. |LC|haT76Sa86|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Let us count the spades held by East. We know from the bidding that West has five Spades and we see 6 spades. That means East only has two. So we cannot afford ruff by opponents in spade. Further the opening must be from @SKQ at least.|PC|S3ST|

To make the contract you need first, to strip East of Spades and second, to pray he has the @CA. (You know you have to play the cards as if they were where you need them!) |
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Step one is to hold up on our @SA till the second trick, which strips East. At tricks 3 and 4, we pull our trumps. At trick 5, we play a Club, sighing with relief when East has it. |
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Our plan comes together when we win East's return. Then the drop of our losing Spade, and the rest are ours.

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the Next Page, it cancels the double dummy feature.
