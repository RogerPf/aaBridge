^-|CP||AT|^c@2^Y@3^*B* * You need to do second hand low smoothly. It takes practice and good nerves.

* * Never let the opponents play at the 2 level when they have an 8+ card fit. So, if you are sure the opponents have an 8+ card fit, and have stopped in the 2 level, make sure you do not let them play there. Once in a while it will not work out. But works more often than not.

* * In general, when leading back partner's suit you lead your remaining count. Since you lead high low with a doubleton, with 2 left you would lead high. And if giving count, you lead low from 3 small, you lead low with 3 remaining. Counting is a very important bridge skill

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The question is, with both ^*B4 hearts^*N and ^*B3 spades^*N, should Babs bid 2@H or 2@S?
There are 3 approaches.
##1 - Give priority to supporting pard's suit.
## 2 - bid your 4-card major. When you have both 3-card support and the other major.
## 3 - always bid hearts.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't have a strong preference, so long as you agree. I personally play that you support pard with 3-card support when you have a choice. But any of the 3 alternatives are fine.|mb|3S|sk||

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's see how we do in spades. We have 11 tricks, 5 spades, 5 diamonds and a club. As to whether Babs should bid 4@S, that is not clear. If we count her declarer points (my double means we must have a spade fit) she has 10 Declarer Points--10 HCP 1 length point -1 for @HJ x. So only 10 declarer points. It is hard to get to 4@S.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to what Gail should do, that is interesting as well. If she assumes Kia has 7 clubs, then by LOTT she can bid 4@C right away. But there is always an issue when you bid 4 of a minor in a competitive auction when the opponents have a major. |
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is, "Will you be happy if the opponents bid 4 of their major?" If the answer is no, then you should consider passing even if you have the LOTT bid. So I would probably pass with Gail's hand  because I don't think I am happy if the opponents bid 4@S, even with my 4 spades. But her bid worked out ok, -50 instead of -200 had we played it in 3@S.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|She would win a lot of IMPs so long as we decide not to bid 4@S. I might bid 4@S but I am not sure how strong Babs hand is.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I was asked could I have bid 3@D?|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


AT| That is possible. the reason I chose not to is, if we have a game, it is likely to be in a major. When choosing between several alternatives, choose the alternative that is likely to give you the best plus if it works out. So in this case, doubling is the best way for us to get to 4 of a major if we should be there. |
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Whereas 3@D may be the best contract, but it makes it harder for us to get to game in a major. That is why I doubled, in the hopes that we could get to 4 of a major. But 3@D is certainly an acceptable bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The question is, what should Gail bid over 2@H? Double and correct is certainly possible. The bid I choose is 3@S. That says, "Partner I have a self sufficient spade suit and a very good hand", bid 4 if you have a trick or two. Don't worry about how many spades you have. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think bidding spades is a bit better than doubling, although a double and correct is certainly possible.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First let's talk about my bid in the context of what Kia's bid is supposed to show. From my perspective Kia has shown a hand with no defense and 7 (or maybe 6) diamonds. So it is very obvious they have game. If Kia really had a 3@D bid. Therefore, I am willing to play 5@D especially at this vulnerability. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We have 10 or 11 diamonds and no defense in theory. But I decided to bid 4@D in case they let us play there. I expect them to bid 4@S, and am planning to bid 5@D then anyway. So in this case I am not "unhappy" when they bid 4@S, since that is what I expect them to bid.|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now Kia's bid. It is definitely very misleading to partner:
a) it shows more diamonds and b) it shows much fewer HCP.|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The problem with 3@D is, it will mislead me and I will often make the wrong decisions as to what to bid. As it turns out, it worked out ok, because they can make 3@S--losing 2 diamonds a spade and a club. But I would bid 5@D over 4@S had they bid it, and then it works out badly. Kia should be content to bid 2@D.|

^-{    Beginner Intermediate Lounge     }
^-|fp||ht|c|at|^b@2Maureen Hall (hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

- Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players.
- Where beginner and intermediate players could get to meet and practice together. 
-Where those serious about improving could  have one-on-one lessons with a Mentor 

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily,- Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Team Matches, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite and more.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lesson and  help notes became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. 

Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

In 2013 , in order to offer more opportunities for study, the BIL now operates from two sites.  
1. the BILies Retreat in the BBO Public Clubs, where the open teaching and practice sessions and specials event are held. A place for members to bring their non BIL friends.  
2. The LearnBrdge Classroom in the BBO Private Club section where level restricted, pre-registered, topic specific Courses are held

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
