^-|ht|j|va|2|CP||fp||AT|^c@2^Y@3^*BIn Notrump, often, declarer needs to give up the lead to establish one or two other suits. He needs protection in his short suits to prevent the opponents running those suits. Those protections are ^*Bstoppers^*N. They are protected honor in 2+-card combinations. A short suit then may have none, a half, one, or more stopper. ^*BOne half-stopper (in the dummy) combined with another (in hand) will give the declarer one full stopper.

All ^*Bunprotected singleton honors excluding the ace^*N and ^*Bxxx ^*N(3 small cards in short suits) have no stoppers.

All the following holdings have two stoppers:
^*BA K, K Q J, Q J T 9, A Q x ^*N
(If the K is under the suit, there are two stoppers; if the K is over it, there is only one).

All the following holdings have one stopper:
^*BA, K Q, Q J T, J 10 x x, K J x x ^*N
(If the A and Q are under it, both the K and the J can stop the suit, however, if both the A and Q are over it, the K and the J are useless). ^*BK^*Nx has a particular position. It is a full stopper on opening lead if Kx is in declarer's hand (because if the suit is led, it is guaranteed to win a trick). But it is an iffy stopper if it is in dummy.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As usual, 3N is as good or better than 5@D. So, the next time you have an opening hand with 5+ clubs and a 4 card major and partner opens 1@D, bid 2@C. Also remember about when the 4th suit asks for a stopper. This was a very instructive auction. The more important point is my 3@S bid asking for a spade stopper.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, length before strength. However, suppose you held this hand (@Sxx @HAxxx @Dxx @CKxxxx) when partner opened 1@D. With only 7 HCP you are too weak to bid 2@C so you would have to bid 1@H.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And, many people play over 1@C, even if you have 5 diamonds and a 4-card major, you bid the major and bypass 1@D. A  usual, bridge is not always so simple. But in general "length over strength" is good advice.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Leading a suit with Qxx is often a bad lead so I will lead a diamond. In these lessons, I play "top of nothing" leads however, although I don't consider the 10 an honor, if I have a suit headed by the 10 I don't lead the 10 (unless I have the 9). On this hand I would lead the @D8. even if I had, for example @D 10 8 5. The 10 often turns out to be important, so I don't like to lead it.|PC|D8|

But in general her line of play works 75% of the time. When you have the AQ109 and are missing the K and J, taking 2 finesses is by far the best way to play the suit.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is no reason to bid NMF Don. Using Bergen hand evaluation lets count your declarer points are; 8 HCP, 2 for spade length, 1 for diamond length, and 1 for 4 card side suit = 12. Your hand is worth 12 declarer points not considering the 4 for void—the void is in Liz's suit, so maybe it is not worth as much. Further, East guarantees at least 2 spades with the 1NT bid and you have 6 spades—you know you have at least an 8-card spade fit. |
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With enough points to force to game, you can simply bid 4@S with their known 8+ card fit. You only bid NMF with a 5-card suit to check if partner has 3. With a 6-card suit, you have always have a known 8-card fit. This is the same idea as when you bid Texas when partner opens 1NT. If you have 10+ with a 6-card major, you bid Texas knowing that you have at least an 8-card fit.|

In general the less information you give the defense, the better. The general rule is:|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@S was not a great contract, but it wasn't the worst I have ever been in. If spades are 2-2, and diamonds behave, you could make 4, although granted it is very unlikely. So perhaps 2@S would have been a better bid, especially considering Liz opened 1@C. But 5-5-3 hands are very powerful, much more so than their points indicate. Two 5-card suits and a void is really nice and if Liz's points were elsewhere, it had some plays.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Lets talk about Don's opening bid. He has 3 plausible choices, 1@S, 2@C, and 2N. 2N would be my 3rd choice. With 6 nice spades, on most hands, a spade contract will probably be best. However, he does have 20 HCP and 23 Bergen starting points (add 2 for length and 1 for quality suit). So should he open 2@C and then bid 2@S over 2@D?|
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If we use my modified Bergen rule (4 quick tricks and 9 winners), it is close. He has 7 tricks in hearts and spades when counting winners you give partner an "average" number of cards in the suit. In this case, with a 6 card suit, there are 7 cards between the other 3  hands. On average, partner will have slightly more than 2 cards in the suit. That means an 8 card fit is likely at least, and for the purposes of counting tricks you can assume a good break.|
PG| ***** 96 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That's how we get to 6 spade tricks. So he has 7 tricks in the majors. The minors are trickier. Count 1/2 a trick in clubs, maybe a smidgen less. Count a little more than half a trick in diamonds. So the hand is worth 8 to 8.5 tricks IMO a little shy of 2@C opener. It does have 4 quick tricks however, which is the other part of the rule of deciding when to open 2@C. I would not hate a 2@C opener, that would be my 2nd choice.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My first choice would be to open 1@S. But if you prefer 2@C I think that is fine. Over 1@S, my intention would be, if partner responds at all, to jump to 4@S. But with her hand Liz possibly pass 1 spade. Then, assuming we don't bid (but we will) it makes 3@S.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had Don opened 1@S with her 6-5 hand Jenny might bid Michaels and I would bid 3@H. Not sure what Don should do then. I probably bid 4@S with his hand. A plausible auction is 1@S-2@S-P-3@H-4@S. It is just too bad I have such a good hand and Liz has such a bad hand. If Liz had one of my aces, 4@S makes easily.|

sv|n|mb|p|NT||lb|*bWhat should be the bid?^^1c|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1@C is the correct bid- East is not quite strong enough to open 2@C. Opening 2@C requires that your hand has 9 winners and that you have 4 quick tricks. In terms of the number of winners, the spade suit is worth 3 tricks. For the club suit, you can assume partner has an "average" ## of clubs. So this means, with 6 clubs remaining between the other 3 hands, you can assume for the purposes of counting winners that West will hold 2 clubs (6 / 3) on average, meaning your average fit is 9 cards. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you want to be optimistic, you can count the club suit for 6 winners -- clubs may break 2-2 or when you play the CA, one of the opponents may have a singleton honor. So the East hand can (optimistically) count 9 winners. However, East only has 3 quick tricks, not 4. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Additionally, on marginal 2@C openers, I prefer not to open 2@C when my long suit is a minor. This is because the auction will start 2@C-P-2@D-P-3@C, so, when you your suit is a minor, you are already at the 3-level before you can actually begin describing what your hand has.|mb|1C|

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|lb|*bWhat should be the bid?^^2s|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@S is the correct bid- this is a jump shift by opener. It establishes a game force, because it shows enough points (18+) to guarantee that your side has enough points to bid game even if responder has a minimum response (6)|mb|2S|
pg| ***** 107 ***** |


mb|p|sk||mb|3D|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would not bid this 3@D. I play 3@D is asking for a diamond stopper. If West had a diamond stopper, he would bid 2N or 3N. So by bidding 3@D, he should be asking partner if he has a diamond stopper. Note that 3@D is NOT 4th suit forcing. 4th suit forcing is used when responder wants to establish a game force. Since 2@S already established a game force, 4th suit forcing is no longer needed nor available as a bid.|
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With the West hand, I would consider bidding 6NT immediately. West has 16 HCP (and 18 Bergen points) which means their side has more than enough to be in 6. With 2 aces, it is virtually impossible for East, who has shown a very strong hand, not to have at least 1 ace. So their side has the points for 6NT and cannot be missing 2 aces. As Bergen says, "She how knows, goes".|

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.|
