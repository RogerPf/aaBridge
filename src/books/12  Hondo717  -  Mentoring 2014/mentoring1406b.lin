^-|CP||AT|^c@2^Z@3^*BOne of the most common defensive errors less experienced players make is to not train themselves to play second hand low smoothly and quickly. There are few exceptions to this rule. The main exception you should keep in mind is that it is ok to play second hand high to win the trick when it is the setting trick (or your side can cash the setting tricks). But other than that, if you always play second hand low smoothly, it will gain you far more tricks than it will lose you. So it is very important that you train yourself to smoothly duck when you are second hand to a trick.

The primary objective for second hand is to cover an honor led by declarer to promote some secondary card or cards for either himself or the partner. Therefore, second hand should not cover if such mission cannot be accomplished.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Of course, had Don been playing against less experienced defenders, he would have made more tricks. Defense is by far the  hardest part of bridge. I highly recommend going through my Basic Defense lesson series |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/#defense^*N|CP||AT| and pay attention to Kia's new movie series on defense |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/#bwdef^*N|CP||AT|.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One question I got is why I opened 1@D as opposed to 1@C. There are 2 methods for deciding which minor to open when you are short. The more popular method is to open 1@C when you are 3-3 in the minors. If you play that way, then when you open 1@D you almost always have 4. The only time you don't is when you have exactly 4 spades, 4 hearts, 3 diamonds, and 2 clubs.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other way, which I prefer is to open your better minor when you are 3-3, slightly  preferring clubs when the 2 minors are about equal. One of the top players in New England even takes this theory to an extreme. If he has for example, Kx in one minor and xxx in the other minor, he will open the Kx suit. Its up to you which you prefer.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In fact, no matter which you prefer, most of the time when you open 1 of a minor you will have a 4-card suit over 80% of the time. If you prefer to open 1@C when 3-3 then you have 4 diamonds about 90% of the time and 4 clubs around 80% of the time. Moreover, if you open better minor you will have a 4-card suit in whatever minor you open about 85% of the time.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@D by DON is a "reverse" and shows 5+ clubs, and shorter diamonds (usually a 4-card suit). Further, it also shows at least 16 points or so. You may check this tutorial for Reverse bids. |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/f43ddx^*N.|CP||AT||
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


ub||mb|1N|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, this is why some experts would open Don's hand 1@D so they can bid 2@C. But I completely disagree with that approach. If you open 1@D when 4-5, partner will never know your length in either minor. Although some teachers will teach you to open 1@D with East's hand, I will not. And I disagree with the concept (although many good players disagree with me). Regardless, I think 1N is Don's best bid here.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once again I have no good lead. My choice are to either lead clubs or spades or diamonds. Hearts are out. On this hand I know Don has at least 4 clubs. The reason I know that is that he bid 1N over 1@H. If he only had 3 clubs, he has to have a 4-card major, and once he bids 1N he cant have a 4-card major.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Correct he at best has 3 spades and 2 hearts. So he has to have at least 4 clubs, with 4 diamonds and 4 clubs he might have opened 1@D—it is likely he has 5 clubs and he should have at least 3 diamonds. So I guess a spade is best. I don't generally like to lead short suits against NT, but here it makes some sense.|pc|ST|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Liz violated 2 of my important defensive principles :):
a) the most important is SECOND HAND LOW. That is crucial. Just do it. It will work out almost all the time. You need to get in the habit of doing it smoothly.

b) the 2nd principle, which is the very rare exception to 2nd hand low is "It is never wrong to take the setting tricks."|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case, Liz can take the @HK and @SA and guarantee down 1. Therefore, either Liz should play low, figuring it is not likely that Don has 9 tricks or play high (my choice) to make sure of the set. Regardless, playing the J will never be a good play. At worst it won't matter, but it could easily hurt if I didn't have the 10. As you can see, if I did not have the @H10 then Liz's play of the @HJ really would have cost a trick.|pc|hqh2|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Double by North is problematic because of lack of clubs. However, with her very very nice diamonds and 4 card spade support, you could justify a double by Jenny. After her double, if I bid clubs, it would not be horrible for Jenny to double and correct to 2@D. Her suit is certainly more than strong enough. Her high card strength is a little weak, but finding a spade fit might make the risk worth it, since 2@D would not be that much of an over bid.|

sk||mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@C is forcing Liz and you cannot pass. A better bid is 3@D hoping for 3N. you should never bypass 3N when there is a chance it is the correct contract. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me explain when a cue is "support." It is only support if 
a) you have not bid anything other than possibly pass and 
b) partner has only bid 1 suit.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So it is only support when the cue bidder is responder and their strength is unknown. Any other cue bid is almost always asking for a stopper for NT. Remember, a cue bid shows a limit raise or better, so it is used to allow for preemptive raises on weak hands.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, Liz has already bid, so partner knows she has a strong hand. If she has support for partner she can just raise him. A preemptive raise is not possible since Liz is known to be strong. The bottom line is a support cue bid can only be made by responder to an opener or an overcaller.|

Liz111:  But I don't have spades stopped either - doesn't my asking for diamond stop say that I have spade stopper?|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is a bit of a risk, but 3N is almost always better than 5 of a minor. And since the opponents have not bid spades, odds are partner has something in spades. Not to mention, you are probably getting a diamond lead.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Excellent bid by Don. Whenever you are in a competitive situation, distribution is the key. The law of total tricks is one guide, but here Don is not sure how many clubs Liz has. The other important factor is shortness in the opponents suit. A singleton spade in his hand is very nice. So on marginal hands where you are thinking of whether or not to bid 1 more, the tie breaker is length in the opponent's suit. With 6-4 distribution and a singleton in our suit, 5@C is the bid most experts would make.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here I could make a negative double, but with 6 spades and 4 hearts there are very few hands where hearts will play better than spades. So I think 1@S is a better bid.|mb|1S|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Don did a good job of unblocking the minor suits. That was a tricky hand to play. The very important bidding principle is new suits BY RESPONDER are forcing. As opener you may not pass a new suit by responder. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand some people have the misconception that it also means that new suits by opener are forcing. That is not true. If the bidding goes 1@C-P-1@H-P-1@S, for example, 1@S is not forcing. It is rare that it will be passed, but it is not forcing. The only way for opener to make a forcing bid is to jump shift or reverse.|

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.|
