mb|p|NT||sk|e|lb|*bWhat should East bid?^^p|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think pass is probably right. But let's count cozamar's declarer points. 12 HCP, +1 length, -1 for @SJx = 12 Starting Points. Declarer add ons are 1 for 2 doubletons, and 1 for 4 card club side suit = 14. |
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Their side has 24-26. You need 26 to bid game, so unless Kia has 12 they should not be in game. If they had a 9-card fit, I might stretch and bid game. But with an 8-card fit, my advice is to be more conservative and not stretch to bid game.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I also would have passed with the East hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I will not lead a club because that suit was bid (although granted it could be a 3 card suit). Also a doubleton is normally not a good lead. Not to mention that I do not want to ruff as I have 2 natural trump tricks.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A spade is possible. Many teachers feel that K from KQ is a strong lead. However, I do not agree. I will lead it if I have no better choice. But I have found it often gives away a trick if declarer holds both the A and J. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is better to lead K from KQJ or KQ10. So I will choose a heart, as that gives away nothing and might cut down on ruffs.|pc|HQ|

What that means is that opening leads are very difficult. There are principles you should follow that make it more likely your opening lead will work out.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are many hands where you simply will not be able to figure out the best opening lead. Even the best players often choose the wrong opening lead.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You did the best you could. You might have been able to sneak a club trick I guess. Had I stared with 4 diamonds instead of 3, your line also yields 7 tricks. If you do the clubs right away, you risk a ruff.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So your line might have worked out better. In any case, the best you can do is down 2 double dummy.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a good illustration of why an 8-card fit is not nearly as good as a 9-card fit. It is more likely you get a bad break (4-1 happens about 1/3 of the time). And when you get a bad break, you are often in big trouble. |
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So remember to be more conservative with a known 8-card fit, be more aggressive with a known 9-card fit.|

NT||sb|e|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I had a question about what I think about Flannery 2@D. If you open 2@D playing Flannery, that shows 4 spades 5 hearts and 11-15 points.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am usually somewhat neutral about recommending against conventions that people like to play. But, when asked about Flannery, I always say this:|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


cs|6|ht|q|fp|3|aT|^-{
     It is one of the dumbest conventions ever invented.     
}

pg| ***** 65 ***** |


fp||cs||cp||NT||bt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is no reason to play it. First of all, unless you are exactly 4-5-2-2 you never have a problem bidding your hand. If you have a 3 card minor and you open 1@H and partner bids 1N, you bid your 3 card minor. You know partner does not have 4 spades when they bid 1N, so you have not missed your spade fit.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And when you are 4-5-2-2 as Liz was on this hand, you just bid 2@C. Most often partner bids 2@H and you land on your feet anyway. Even on this hand, where I passed 2@C, it is just as good a contract as 2@H, maybe even better.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The problem hand that Liz had comes up twice a year. And when it does, partner often can either raise hearts or bid spades. |
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So you give up a weak 2 diamonds, which comes up frequently, for a hand that almost never causes a big problem.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another student did bring up the one strength that Flannery has. That is, if you play Flannery and your partner opens 1@H, if you respond 1@S that promises a 5-card spade suit. The reason being, if you play Flannery, partner cannot have 5 hearts and 4 spades unless they have a strong hand, 16+. So there is no need for responder to bid 1S with 4 cards.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Of course, I did have one partner who insisted on Flannery and we sometimes got messed up when opener had 6 hearts and 4 spades. Because then opener bid 1@H and responder would bypass a 4 card spade suit and we missed our 4-4 spade fit.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, Kia has a weak opener so he uses "fast arrival" to say he has no slam interest because he has a min opener. It does tell me Kia has no more than 14 or so. But that is not a shut out bid per se. I can bid on if I have 18+|

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
