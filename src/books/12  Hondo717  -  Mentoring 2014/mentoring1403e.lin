^-|at|^c@2^Y@3(1). The first step in playing a bridge hand as  declarer is to count your sure tricks.

(2) A sure trick is a trick that can be taken without giving up the lead.

(3) You can never take more tricks in a suit than there are cards in the longer hand. If both you and your dummy have two cards in one suit, the most tricks you can take in that suit is two.

(4) When taking sure tricks, play the high cards(s)from the short side first. This will allow you to end up on the long side, where you can cash the rest of the tricks in the suit.

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NThe following board is from Howard's voice session. East/West are playing 2/1 Forcing to Game. It is so unique that Movie Maker received the following directive from Howard. With it he effectively took over and I may be out of my day job -:).|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In terms of the bidding, this is one of the most interesting hands we have ever seen in all my teaching sessions. So I will write an extensive explanation of the bidding which you can then integrate into the movie.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


sk|e|md|4S358TQHTD234C347T,S7H36D5679JKAC29K,S2469KH249D8TQC6A,|sv|n|NT||lb|*mWould you open this hand 2C?^Yes~No~It is a close call^2|lb|*bIf you would not open 2C, what should be the bid by East?^^1H|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1@H is the correct bid. Is East strong enough to open 2@C? It is close, but I do not think so. A fairly easy and effective way to decide whether or not to open 2@C is to use what I call the "9 trick rule". |
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you think your hand will take 9 tricks opposite a partner with no HCP and average distribution, you should open 2@C. East can count 8 tricks for sure -- 7 hearts and a spade. If you wanted to argue that it is possible that East will take a club trick, which would give East a 9th trick, that is plausible but a bit aggressive. I think East's hand is worth about 8.5 tricks, not quite enough to open 2@C.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is also the Marty Bergen "4 and 4" rule for deciding whether or not to open 2@C. That rule says you can open 2@C if you have 4 quick tricks and 4 losers. The quick trick counting part of the rule is straight forward. But the "4 loser" part of the rule is not. So recently I have decided to simplify by combining the Marty Bergen rule with the 9 trick rule. |
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My 9 winners rule is essentially equivalent to 4 losers. So you can open 2@C if you have 9 winners and 4 quick tricks. On this hand, East only has 3 quick tricks (2 in hearts and 1 in spades) so the hand does not qualify.|mb|1H|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


mb|p|sk|W|NT||lb|*bE/W play 2/1. What should be the bid by West?^^2d|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West should bid 2@D. Although West only has 11 HCP, she has a clear game force. Using Bergen starting Points, her hand is worth 11 HCP + 3 length points + 1 quality suit point for a total of 15. That is more than enough to force to game.|mb|2D|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


mb|p|sk|e|NT||lb|*bWhat should be the bid by East?^^3H|mb|3H|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bid ^*B3@H^*N - In the 2/1 style, a jump rebid in your suit has a very specific meaning once a game force has been established. It does NOT show the same thing as a jump rebid in a non-game forcing auction (such as 1@H-1N-3@H). In that auction, 3@H shows a medium hand with a nice 6-card suit. |
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But 3@H has a completely different meaning once a game force has been established. The message 3@H conveys is "Partner, I have a self sufficient suit. That suit is going to be our trump suit. Please start control bidding so we can see if we can bid slam."|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What is a "self sufficient" suit? Since voids are extremely rare, you can assume partner has at least a singleton in your suit. A self sufficient suit is a suit where you likely have at most one loser opposite a singleton. East's heart suit clearly qualifies as being self sufficient. In fact, it is likely to have no losers even opposite a void. |
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even if the opponents hold 6 cards in hearts, the odds that they break no worse than 4-2 is well over 90%, meaning that East is virtually guaranteed that he will have no heart losers no matter how many hearts partner holds.|mb|p|sk|w|NT||lb|*bWest is interested in slam. What should be the bid now?^^3s|mb|3S|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@S is the correct bid. West is showing first or second round control in spades, That means West is showing an ace, king, singleton, or void. On this hand, East can make a 3@S control bid because her singleton is second round control.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


mb|p|sk|E|NT||lb|*mEast wishes to show his diamond void. Is 4D technically a correct bid?^It is~It is not~It is not but the best available^3|mb|4D|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For many reasons 4@D is the best bid available. East knows their side has enough points to be in slam. The only issue is whether or not their side has two quick club losers. The way to find that out is for East to bid 4@D. That conveys 2 messages. It says "Partner, I have first or second round control in diamonds". It also says "Partner, I do not have first or second round control in clubs". Why is that? Because you always make the cheapest control bid you can make. So since East bypassed 4@C, that says he does not have a control in clubs.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although I would bid 4@D with the East hand, technically that may not be a 100% correct bid. I did say that you can control bid with shortness (singleton or void) as well as with high cards (ace or king). However, you should not control bid with shortness in partner's suit. Since West bid 2@D, theoretically East should only bid 4@D with the @DA or @DK, not with diamond shortness. However, on this hand, East wants to convey his concern about his lack of a club control. And 4@D is the best way to convey that message.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let me give you anther expert's bid. Rather than 4@D, some experts would bid 3N. That is not a natural bid because East's 3@H bid already set hearts as the trump suit. Rather, it is a space saving bid asking West to make another control bid. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That works perfectly on this hand. West will bid 4@C over 3N and East will now know that their side has clubs controlled. In that case, over 4@C, East can simply bid 6@H, knowing that he has first round control in spades, hearts, and diamonds, and at least 2nd round control in clubs. But for now we stay with the current bidding.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


mb|p|sk|w|NT||lb|*bWhat should West bid now?^^4n|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4NT - West know that 4@D indicates that East is concerned about a club control. But she has the @CK and therefore has the club control that East was worried about. That means, knowing that her side has controls in all the side suits, East can now bid 4NT just to make sure their side has enough key cards to bid slam.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||mb|4N|mb|p|NT||sk|E|lb|*yOf course you know how to respond to 4N with a void. Should East report the diamond void?^^n|lb|*bOf course not. Then what should be the bid by East--RKC 1430?^^5D|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bid 5@D.|mb|5D|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is a way to show a void when responding to 4NT. However, you should only show a "useful" void. A  useful void is a void not in partner's suit. Since West bid 2@D, East's diamond void is not  useful, so he should bid 5@D (assuming they are playing 1430 responses) to show 0 or 3 key cards. |
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Based on the auction, West can be quite sure that East has 3 key cards, not 0. Since East showed a self-sufficient heart suit, he must have at least one heart key card, otherwise he would not have at most 1 heart loser. So he cannot have 0 key cards.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had the diamond void been useful, then East would have responded 6@D to 4N. A jump to 6 of a suit over 4NT shows a void in that suit and an odd number of key cards (1 or 3).  The only restriction is that East must never bid past 6 of the trump suit. So, if East had a spade void and an odd number of key cards, he would bid 6@H (since 6@S would force their side to 7@H). If East had responded 6@H, then West would know that East had a spade void with 1 or 3 key cards.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If East had a void with an even number of key cards (2 or 4), he would respond 5NT. This does not identify where the void is, but it is the best you can do when you have to show an even number of key cards.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


mb|p|sk|W|lb|*bWhat should be the bid by West?^^6h|cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Missing only 1 key card and knowing East has a self sufficient heart suit, West has an easy 6@H call.|mb|6H|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


NT||mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|sk||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is one additional interesting point on this hand. Once partner bids 4NT, she is the "captain" of the auction and you must abide by whatever decision she makes regarding whether or not your side should be in slam. However, this hand is a very very rare exception to that rule. Let us suppose that West bid 5@H over 5@D. That would mean East/West are missing 2 key cards. (West would bid 6@H if missing only 1 key card.) Since East has 3 key cards, he knows that the 2 key cards their side are missing are the @CA and @DA. However, with his diamond void, they will not be losing a diamond trick. So in this very rare instance, East could and should override a 5@H bid by West and bid 6@H.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But you should virtually never override partner when he is the one who initiates RKCB. This is an extremely rare exception to that rule.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding was ok, assuming you play the Bergen OBAR style. Let me briefly review it. OBAR stands for "Over Opponents Bid And Raise." Bergen believes you should "pre balance" whenever the auction goes 1x-P-2x, especially if the opponents bid a major. That means if you have something to say you should say it, even with not that many points. |
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Basically you should make the same bid as you would if it went 1@H-P-2@H-P-P. Because then you would be balancing and don't need that good a hand to bid. So if you play OBAR, you pretend you are balancing. Which means if you have a long suit you bid it, or if you have a singleton and 3+ cards in the other suits you can make a takeout double. You can also bid 2N which is takeout for the minors. Not only 5-5. It could be 5-4 or even 4-4 with 2 good minor suits.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Usually when you make an OBAR bid you are short in the opps suit, and this was not the case with North hand. Plus the @HK is in a dubious position. He probably could pass. As I said, I only told him to bid so I could discuss OBAR. I think if I had his hand at an actual table I would pass (reluctantly as usual :) :).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Kadu on the other hand needs to be aggressive with her hand. She has 11 Dummy Points. I might treat that as a 3-card limit raise. But she has lots of quacks. So she made the (uncharacteristic for her) conservative bid of 2@H, which is reasonable.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding was fine. Lets see the best way to play the hand. I always like to count winners. So you can count 2 diamonds, 1 club, 1 heart, and 4 spades for sure. You need 2 more tricks. If the opponents promise not to lead trump you can ruff 2 hearts. But if Babs plays hearts, I will win the ace and play @SA and another spade and she will be down 1. |
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other possibility is to hope the @DQ is tripleton and try and set up diamonds. I would probably lead a heart to the Q at trick 2, and ruff a diamond. And then play a spade. if I duck, Babs can then play the DK and pitch a club and when the Q doesn't drop she still goes down 1 unfortunately. But at least she had a play Regardless, that is a hard hand to play.|

If partner bids 1N and then bids their own suit, they are showing essentially a weak 2 in their suit, and you should pass unless you would have made a bid over a weak 2 opener.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is an interesting hand to bid. Very rare case where "4 over 3" might be right. By LOTT Kadu can bid 4@D. The problem with bidding 4 over 3 when you have a minor and the opponents have a major is as follows. Before Kadu bids 4@D, she has to decide if she will be happy if we bid 4@S. If the answer is no, then she should not bid 4@D. With her hand I agree that she would not be happy. |
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Kia has to decide the same thing. In his case, with 2 aces, and Kadu having a limit raise, he might be happy if we bid 4@S. Because, he would be willing to defend 4@S given Kadu has some values. So 4@D had some merit, although I personally probably do not bid it.|

So Kia only bids 3@H or 3@S with a 5 card suit. With a 4 card suit he bids 3@D (that is his bid on this hand) and with no 4 card major he would bid 3N.|sb|e|mb|3C|

^-{    Beginner Intermediate Lounge     }
^-|fp||ht|c|at|^b@2Maureen Hall (hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

- Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players.
- Where beginner and intermediate players could get to meet and practice together. 
-Where those serious about improving could  have one-on-one lessons with a Mentor 

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily,- Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Team Matches, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite and more.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lesson and  help notes became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. 

Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

In 2013 , in order to offer more opportunities for study, the BIL now operates from two sites.  
1. the BILies Retreat in the BBO Public Clubs, where the open teaching and practice sessions and specials event are held. A place for members to bring their non BIL friends.  
2. The LearnBrdge Classroom in the BBO Private Club section where level restricted, pre-registered, topic specific Courses are held

^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
