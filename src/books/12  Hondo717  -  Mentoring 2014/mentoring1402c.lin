^-|CP||AT|^c@2^Y@3When contract bridge was first played, back in the twenties and early thirties, it was a puzzle as to what to do with a 4-4-4-1 hand with opening count after an opponents opening bid. Obviously it could play very well. 

But in order to find a good trump suit, one really wanted to whisper across the table: "Pard, do you have a four—card suit that will match one of mine so we can make beautiful music together?" 

Anyway, back then, Britain and American had a strong  rivalry. "We invented it", You didn't", "We‘re better!" "No, we are." etc. Then at a  particularly hard-fought match which took place before a wide audience at Harrods, the department store in London, the Americans used the first takeout double to describe this problem hand.

"Foul!" cried the British. "Double must be for penalty." After a fair amount of argument and negotiation, the Americans were permitted to use the double as a takeout bid. This was the birth of the first "artificial" bid!|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Often with shortness in the opponents suit, you should reopen with a double. The reason being, Gary cannot make a penalty double (double would be negative) so you have to protect in case partner has a penalty double. On the other hand, since Gary is a passed hand, a penalty double is unlikely so with my nice distribution I will just bid my other suit.|mb|3D|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think we make 6@D because diamonds behave. I think Gary was a bit pessimistic once I bid 3@D. It is true I might (rarely) have a 4 card diamond suit, but you should assume I have 5. By LOTT we probably have a 10 card.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When you bid 4 of a minor and they have a major suit fit before you bid 4 of the minor, you have to decide whether you will be happy if they bid 4 of their major. If you will be unhappy (e.g. you think they might make it) then you should not bid 4 of the minor. Gary could have decided that was the case although with an ace and a king, he has some defense. And since I opened he can assume I have 2 tricks.|

PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Its not. It shows a medium hand (16-18 or so). Partner will often pass. I think you are confusing this bidding with the bidding playing 2 over 1 when it goes 1@H-P-2@D-P-3@H. In that case, 3@H says "Partner we are playing in hearts, start control bidding." But in a non-game forcing auction, a jump rebid (e.g jumping in your suit) shows a medium hand. So to force to game, you either have to bid 4@H or make a jump shift. Even if partner has a void, you have a great suit.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


NT|^B@2
nome: I am afraid that most partners consider the 4@H is "Shut out" and we would not be able to explore for slam. My partner's bid only tells me she has 6+ and at least 4 spades.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, 4@H is NOT "to play." It says "Partner I have 20 points and a great heart suit". Partner, with an opening hand, can and should bid on. It is a common mistake that many players make that 4@H is a "shut out" and that 3@H is forcing. Neither is true.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A couple of minor points. First a few people asked me if Kia should open 2@C. I personally don't think so, although some people might. The easiest way to decide whether or not to open 2@C is to use the "9  trick rule." If you think your hand can take 9 tricks opposite 0 HCP in pard's hand, but average distribution in the other suits then you are strong enough to open 2@C.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case Kia can count 6 hearts and a diamond for sure. I would count half a club and say 1/2 a spade. That gives him 8 tricks, so he is not strong enough.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other rule is the Bergen "4 and 4 rule" which I find a lot more difficult, and people often get confused about it. Let me briefly cover it here. |
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If your suit is a major, and you have 4 quick tricks and 4 losers, you can open 2@C. But people mess up what Bergen means by "losers." Before I explain Bergen's definition of losers, lets look at Kia's quick tricks. He has 2 in hearts, 1 in diamonds, and 1/2 in clubs which is below 4.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In terms of losers, you don't use the Klinger losing trick count method. You actually figure out how many "losers" you think you have if partner has nothing. In his hands, you can count 0 losers in hearts, because on average partner will have 2 hearts at least (there are 7 out, so on average partner will have 2 1/3 hearts). |
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If partner has 2 hearts, and they break 3-2 you have no heart losers. So it is ok with Bergen to count 0 heart losers. Diamonds are easy. He has 1 diamond loser. Spades are more difficult, but with QJ9 you can be optimistic and say you have 2 spade losers. Nevertheless, clubs are the key.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Klinger would count the clubs as 1 loser. But Bergen would call it 1.5 losers. If partner has nothing in clubs, you will lose 2 clubs half the time. So Bergen would say Kia has a 4.5 or 5 loser hand (depending on what he decided about spades). Regardless he definitely does not have a 4 loser hand using the Bergen 4 and 4 rule.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since most people find it difficult to count losers using the Bergen methodology. I suggest you use the 9 trick rule when deciding whether or not to open 2@C.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not saying you shouldn't play a spade. Here is what you need to think about Babs. You led the @SA. Normally, partner shows you attitude as their first priority. However, the @SQ is on the board and Gary played @SJ. so you know that partner can't like spades. Therefore, when attitude is useless, as here partner gives count. And I either have 3 or 5. If I have 3 that would give Gary 3 which seems unlikely on this auction where he pulled 3N, and dropped the SJ besides and you have the @S10. |
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I probably had 5 and Gary probably has none left. Had I started a high low and Gary dropped the jack you should assume I have an even ## (probably 4) and you would know that Gary started with 2.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|5@D is a reasonable bid, but I find there are rarely hands where 3N is a worse contract than 5 of a minor. On this hand, it turns out if spades are divided differently, you could go down in 3N. But even on this hand, 3N makes. In live bridge (Match Points) I pass 3N with Gary's hand, because you will probably get more Match Points in 3N than 5@D. In IMPs it is not as clear. One advantage that 5@D has is, if Kia has a hand with lots of controls (aces and kings) it might tempt him to bid 6@D.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now lets discuss how Kia might have bid the hand. In the old days (when I first started playing bridge in the 60s), with 5-5 in the black suits, you opened 1@C and rebid spades twice. But these days with 5-5 in the blacks you open 1@S. |
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, with 6-5 Kia should probably start with 1@C then if he rebids spades twice I will have a better picture of his hand. That would show 5-6. But, we ended up in a nice 4@S contract. I think 5@C goes down. so his bidding worked out well. Kia intuitively knew he had way more than 14 HCP and that was good. nice going.|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Remember HCP are only a small part of how good your hand is. When you have a flat hand, they are the majority of the story. But with any sort of distribution, you have to count length, shortness, and where your honors are located. Since Bergen was nice enough to provide us with a way to quantitatively take all those factors into account I suggest you learn and use Bergen hand evaluation.|

^-{    Beginner Intermediate Lounge     }
^-|fp||ht|c|at|^b@2Maureen Hall (hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

- Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players.
- Where beginner and intermediate players could get to meet and practice together. 
-Where those serious about improving could  have one-on-one lessons with a Mentor 

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily,- Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Team Matches, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite and more.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lesson and  help notes became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. 

Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

In 2013 , in order to offer more opportunities for study, the BIL now operates from two sites.  
1. the BILies Retreat in the BBO Public Clubs, where the open teaching and practice sessions and specials event are held. A place for members to bring their non BIL friends.  
2. The LearnBrdge Classroom in the BBO Private Club section where level restricted, pre-registered, topic specific Courses are held

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|1|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
