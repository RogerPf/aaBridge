^-|CP||AT|^c@2^Y@3^*B^*NWhen does Jacoby 2NT occur? The normal standard recommended way of playing is that it is after partner opens a major, your right hand opponent (RHO) passes, and you are not a passed hand. Some players also use Jacoby in competitive auctions. This is possible but I am not going there today. That can be tricky, so be careful if you decide you want to do that. On competitive auctions, slam is much less likely, and since Jacoby 2NT is forcing to game and suggests the possibility of slam, it is definitely not needed. 

What does the Jacoby 2NT show?  At least 4-card support for opener's major – that is important. And you need a hand strong enough to insist on game. But 13 HCP are definitely not the prerequisite. Too many players do not appreciate that, when you have a fit in a major, points for shortness and length must be added. If you ask any knowledgeable experienced player “Would you rather have a doubleton as the dummy or a jack somewhere?”, he or she would laugh because the one point for the doubleton is much more relevant than some old jack. Similarly, a singleton is a much better asset than a queen. So to make a Jacoby 2NT response, you need at least 13 dummy points.

Responder has at least 13 dummy points when he bids Jacoby 2NT. But what is his maximum? How strong a hand might he have? I recommend no upper limit. So, ....

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay we talked about Kia's first bid. As I said, although that was my 3rd choice, it was one of 3 reasonable alternatives. Now over 3@H what should Ed do?|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One thing to consider when you bid 4 of a minor when the opponents are competing in a major is whether or not you will be happy if the opponents bid game in their major. In this case, I think Ed should not worry about if we bid 4@H.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Kia showed a nice hand with his 2@H bid, so we don't have that many HCP. So, if we bid 4@H over 4@C, Ed or Kia should be willing to double that as it is likely to be going down due to lack of strength. So Ed should not worry about bidding 4@C and forcing us into a makeable game.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally I don't like bidding "4 over 3" but Ed has a really nice hand once Kia bids a limit raise. Once Kia raises clubs, he can add 2 points for the singleton and 1 point for the 4-card diamond suit using Bergen declarer points. So he has 17 Bergen Declarer Points, meaning their side has 27 points at least, enough to bid 4@C. So nice 4@C bid Ed.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to whether Kia should bid 5@C I think the answer is clearly no. He showed 10-12 points and 4+ clubs with his first bid and his hand hasn't gotten any better. Yes, strictly speaking he can count 11 HCP, + 1 for the quality suit (although I will discuss why that doesn't matter on this hand), + 1 for the doubleton -1 for the dubious @DQ giving him 12 Dummy Points.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But the quality club suit really doesn't help. e.g the @CJ doesn't really add a trick when they have a 9-card fit and the @HK, although probably worth a trick, does not fit well with partner, who probably has a singleton at most. So his 2@H bid said what he had. |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If partner wanted to be in 5@C opposite a limit raise, partner would have bid 5@C. The basic principle here is, once you tell the story about your hand, don't repeat it unless it has changed. And Kia's hand is still the same limit raise it was when he bid 2@H. It is the hand partner should expect.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, let us make a case for each of the 4 suits. Although it is a bad idea to lead an unprotected ace, given that they did not bid NT and I raise hearts, that is one possibility, although it could work out badly. |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A trump lead is possible, although leading a singleton trump will sometimes give away a trick (such as if I have Qxx). On this auction that is not as likely as it sounds like they have really nice clubs. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Leading away from honors is high risk high reward so I try not to lead away from honors in suit contracts if I have a better alternative. But on this hand, my alternatives (hearts and clubs) are not great, so Babs could decide to lead away from an honor. That has some merit.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Generally I tend to like to lead longer suits than shorter suits. So that would say, if I choose to lead away from an honor a diamond is slightly better than a spade. However, in this case Babs spade holding is much better than her diamond holding. If I hold the A, K, or J in spades her lead will work out. But I need the @DA or @DQ for a diamond to work out. |
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if I have no more intermediates then it still might give away a trick. On the other hand, leading away from Qxx is often a bad idea. So as I said, Babs just has several bad choices, no real good choices. I am not sure what I would have chosen. |
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once Babs makes the reasonable but unfortunate lead of a diamond, the hand can be made. Win the @DQ, play a diamond to the ace. Lead a heart towards the K. Let us assume Babs takes the A since (although 2nd hand low is usually right), based on the auction she knows declarer likely only has  1 heart. |
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us assume she plays a trump back. Declarer should win in his hand and ruff a diamond. He should then play the @HK and throw a spade he can then lead a trump back to his hand and ruff his last diamond. He can then get back to his hand with the @SA, draw trumps and claim, losing 1 spade and 1 heart. So a tough hand to play, but makeable on a diamond lead.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North has a tough rebid. So first he has to decide whether he has a game forcing hand over a reverse. With 8 points it is a borderline decision. Normally with 2 aces I usually feel I have enough to force to game over a reverse, but the heart void is a red flag.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you decide that you have a game force, you theoretically could bid 3@D (4th suit forcing) but that would be completely artificial and say nothing about diamonds. In fact, normally you would bid 3@D without a diamond stopper hoping partner could be 3N. There would be little point in bidding 3@D on this hand as you would likely be giving partner a difficult bidding problem and you would not find out anything useful from partner. So if I decided I had a game force, I would bid 3NT.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I decided that I did not have a game force then I would bid 3@C because of the heart void and known 8+ card club fit. If North bids 3@C, then South should probably just pass since he does not have a maximum hand (18+). Another bid is 2N, to show the diamond stopper but no game force, but 3@C is likely to be a better contract. And if I decided to bid 2N, I might as well bid 3N and be in game.|mb|3D|

I will also do that unless I have a good reason to bid 1@D. In this case, I personally think a 6-card suit is a good reason. But 1@S is fine and the bid that many would choose.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ed has a tough bid over 2@S. 3@D is very reasonable and in fact what I probably choose as the safest bid. With his very nice 6-card suit, which plays reasonably well even opposite a singleton. Other alternatives are 2N and 3@C. If I did not choose 3@D I would probably choose 2N as that has the most upside. Perhaps partner can bid 3N. 3@D might be passed when we can make 3N if partner has the DK and a couple of other tricks but 3D is the safest bid.|

^-{    Beginner Intermediate Lounge     }
^-|fp||ht|c|at|^b@2Maureen Hall (hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

- Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players.
- Where beginner and intermediate players could get to meet and practice together. 
-Where those serious about improving could  have one-on-one lessons with a Mentor 

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily,- Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Team Matches, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite and more.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lesson and  help notes became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. 

Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

In 2013 , in order to offer more opportunities for study, the BIL now operates from two sites.  
1. the BILies Retreat in the BBO Public Clubs, where the open teaching and practice sessions and specials event are held. A place for members to bring their non BIL friends.  
2. The LearnBrdge Classroom in the BBO Private Club section where level restricted, pre-registered, topic specific Courses are held

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|1|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
