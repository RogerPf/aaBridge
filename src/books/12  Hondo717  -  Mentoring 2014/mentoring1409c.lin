unless you have a six-card suit.|

6. When holding three four card suits and a singleton, open the bidding 1@D unless your singleton is in diamonds!
- If it is, open 1@C. You should have at least 12 @HCP to open the bidding with this distribution.
- You hold: @S AKxx @H KJxx @D J10xx @Cx 
Open 1@D.|

7. A takeout double by a passed hand shows 9-11 HCP with shortness in the opener’s suit. If the opponents have 
bid two suits, the double promises at least four-card support for both unbids.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| while you should also strongly consider 1N with 15-18 balanced hand, if you have a 5-card major, you should usually bid that major instead.|mb|1s|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason is,  you need to make sure partner knows you have a major because the opponents are not likely to give you a free run. So I would bid 1@S with the North hand. On the other hand, if the diamonds and spades were reversed e.g. North hand 5 diamonds and 4 spades, I would bid 1N, even with 5422 distribution.|

PG| ***** 90 ***** |


NT||AT|
^B@2^*BMM: ^*NAva as the reigning Queen with his partner usually beats the boys. Howard, occasionally, makes comments about her bidding and/or the plays. However, he stops short of angering the Queen and having his fingers flayed one at a time.|
PG| ***** 91 ***** |

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NThis board is from September 9, 2014, a friendly tournament they play twice a week. When kibbing we can see the four hands. However, here I present the board as you were playing in Ava's place. I make my expert comments on the bidding and the play as I am too far away from the East coast and there is no danger of getting my fingers flayed by Howard.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NLet us keep the South and West hands closed.  The 1N is forcing for one round and denies 3+ card support. And you know Howard likes to get into bidding. He must have a good 5+card hearts and 10-11 points. But as you shall see that was a critical piece of information.|

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }

CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
