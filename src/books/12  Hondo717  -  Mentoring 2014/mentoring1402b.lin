^-|fp||ht|l|VA|5|AT|^c@2^Z@3A. Bidding over a 1NT overcall is different than any other auction. Over suit overcalls doubles are negative and new suits are forcing. But over 1NT the opposite is true. Double shows a good hand (9+) and new suits are to play. Sort of the same idea of how you bid after an opponent's takeout double (e.g. you redouble with a good hand and new suits are not forcing).

B. I know a man whose wife will not let him play bridge. He, therefore, takes long lunches from his tax business in order to play. But this means no one can call him at home for a date to play. So he used to show up regularly on Friday afternoons at the Northern Virginia sectional tournaments without a partner. And he would fill in with anyone around (usually terrible players no one else wanted as partner) either in the Men's Pairs, or even the Women's Pairs, if the movement had a half a table. To make a long story short, Rob won the Northern Virginia women's Pairs three times. The last time, one gal got so mad, she persuaded the Northern Virginia Board to bar him from further Women's Pairs.

I said to him, "Rob, it's not that easy to win the Women's Pairs, particularly with the pick-up partners you had! How in the world did you do it?"

"Well," he said, "I just filled in at the last minute and there was no time to talk about conventions or make out a full convention card. So each time we just wrote at the top: NO ONE PLAYS BELOW 2NT." See that?|

With my hand, since it is strong, potentially a slam if Kia has a real good opener (17+) 1@D might actually be better. Had I bid 1@D on this hand Kia would bid 2@D so I would give up on slam. The reason I would give up on slam after 2@D is with 17+ Kia would bid 3@D. So I would simply bid 2@S and Kia would bid 2N hopefully and we end up in 3N.|

up|52|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I had some questions about DONT and CAPP which I will answer first. The reason I strongly prefer DONT is that it lets you effectively describe both 1 suited and 2 suited hands and compete at the 2 level. In general, once someone opens a strong NT, the odds that your side has game is small. So playing a convention that lets you plays partials at the 2 level is a good thing. And DONT is the only convention that does that. |
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The problem with CAPP is that on many hands you end up having to go to the 3 level. For example, if you have a major and a minor, you bid the major and then if partner has to correct to the minor, you are at the 3 level. |
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also, some argue DONT does not allow you to play penalty doubles. However, I challenge you to find a hand in the next year where someone opens a strong 1N and you get a good result by doubling them at 1N. They will either make it or run out to a suit. So a convention that allows you to double 1NT for penalty is really not very useful IMO even against weak NT.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now one point on the play of the hand. With a 9 card fit missing the Queen, the conventional wisdom is to play for the drop. However the conventional wisdom is wrong most of the time. Given no information in the auction, playing for the drop is only very slightly better than taking the finesse (51 or 52% vs. 50%). |
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But you often have information in the auction. On this hand, Kia has shown 2 suits. So Babs knows 9 or more of Kia's cards are not in hearts. Therefore, it is much more likely that I have the @HQ than Kia. In fact it is quite possible Kia has a singleton. So Babs should play the @HK and then finesse the @HJ and make the hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most kibs are wondering about Sandy's 1N overcall. Anytime you have a good excuse to overcall 1N you should. Whenever you open or overcall 1N you are giving a pretty good picture of your hand. Partner knows your point count (15-17 if opening, 15-18 if Overcalling) within a few points, knows you have balanced distribution and stopper(s) in the bid suit. So you should strain to open and overcall 1N. |
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Opening 1N you should be more disciplined (15-17, no more than 1 doubleton). Overcalling 1N you can be a little more lax. Its a matter of trading off discipline for a better description of your hand. So although Sandy is only "semi-balanced" (e.g. she has 2 doubletons) she has all the other requirements for a 1N overcall--15-18 HCP, and stopper in diamonds. She really has no other good bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you play crawling Stayman, and you are at least 4-4 in the majors with a weak hand after partner opens/overcalls 1NT you can bid Stayman. If the auction goes 1N-2@C-2@D-? and if you play Crawling Stayman. You bid 2@H over 2@D, that says, "Partner I want to play in either 2@H or 2@S." Therefore, either pass or correct to 2@S. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@H is an underbid, as is 4@H and a new suit is very un-descriptive. But playing Bergen Raises, you can describe this sort of hand. You can bid 3@C or 3@D (whichever you play shows the 10-12 raise) and then if partner bids 3@H you still raise to 4@H.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, as misconception when the auction goes 1D-P-1@H-P-4@H many people think 4@H is a "shutout" in that auction. It is not. It shows 20+ points. Therefore, the 1@H bidder could and should explore biding slam with 13+ points. The same is true on this hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not a very successful, at least on the first glance, bid by Kia. Here is the issue. If they have found an 8+ card fit, then indeed having them play at the 2 level is usually not a good result. So you should strain to balance. But on this hand, there is no guarantee they have an 8 card fit. Therefore, it is less clear whether or not you should balance. |
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But having said that, there is some justification for Kia's balance. It is possible we have an 8 card fit, since Sandy has 6 spades. I could easily have 2. So with spade shortness and decent support of the other 3 suits, at favorable vul (Kia not vul, we vul) double had some merit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Babs has made a reverse, showing 5+ clubs, shorter diamonds (usually 4) and 16+ points. She has enough for a reverse and I think that is the best bid. However, I would be worried about my singleton in Kia's suit. not saying she shouldn't reverse. just saying she should be a bit cautious about getting too aggressive.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|bidding by responder after a reverse can be complicated. I play the following:
If responder bids the 4th suit (hearts in this case) that is game forcing. All other bids are not game forcing. However, even when the responder has less than 9 or so partnership cannot stop below 2N.|

PG| ***** 161 ***** |


mb|2N|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Before I show you the East's hand  let me address the default bid by opener in 2/1 when it goes one Major-Pass-2 minor-Pass as in this case. There are 2 styles: |
PG| ***** 162 ***** |


AT|

1. Bergen - Hardy style
2. Mike Lawrence style which I do not agree or play.
|
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bergen - Hardy style is in line with the Law of Total Tricks which is the reason I like. Using that style if East had this hand he should NOT bid 2@H.|md|0,0,0,S QJ6 H AKJ98 D 986 C Q8|
pg| ***** 164 ***** |


AT| East, however, can bid 2N if he does not have another suitable bid–even lacking stoppers which is the case with this hand.|
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, Mike Lawrence recommends biding 2N only if East has stoppers. Otherwise, if there is no other biddable suit East can bid the original suit at the 2 level (2@H here) even with 5-card suit. But here East following Bergen - Hardy style cannot bid 2@H. 2@H in Bergen - Hardy style promises 6-card suit (hearts here). Therefore, East should bid 2N even if he does not have stopper.|
PG| ***** 166 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Again, using Mike Lawrence style East cannot bid 2N if the hand was as we have it now–no stoppers but is allowed to bid 2@H with a 5-card hearts.|
pg| ***** 167 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And why I prefer Bergen-Hardy style? I think that, when you can accurately describe your suit length, that often is equally or even more important than describing your points. Knowing whether your partner has a 5 or 6 card suit is very valuable on many hands. I am willing to bid 2N if necessary without a stopper in order to be able to accurately convey suit length. I find that in real life, I rarely get in trouble by doing so because, if we end up in 3N, partner usually has a stopper when I do not (after all our side is missing less than 15 HCP so it is unlikely 10 of the missing points are in 1 suit).|
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Okay, let us reload the entire deal and continue the bidding.|

^-{    Beginner Intermediate Lounge     }
^-|fp||ht|c|at|^b@2Maureen Hall (hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

- Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players.
- Where beginner and intermediate players could get to meet and practice together. 
-Where those serious about improving could  have one-on-one lessons with a Mentor 

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily,- Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Team Matches, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite and more.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lesson and  help notes became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. 

Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

In 2013 , in order to offer more opportunities for study, the BIL now operates from two sites.  
1. the BILies Retreat in the BBO Public Clubs, where the open teaching and practice sessions and specials event are held. A place for members to bring their non BIL friends.  
2. The LearnBrdge Classroom in the BBO Private Club section where level restricted, pre-registered, topic specific Courses are held

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
