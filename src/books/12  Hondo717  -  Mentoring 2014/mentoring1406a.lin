^-|CP||AT|^c@2^Y@3^*BSlam bidding is very difficult, even for experts. A word to the wise: Do not push overly hard to slam. Everybody misses good slams, hopefully not too often. Obviously there is some luck involved. Sometimes you make 12 tricks because several finesses worked or you got a very fortunate opening lead. You must keep in mind that your goal can't be to always be in slam when 12 tricks are made. If you have that philosophy, you will be going down in too many slams.

It is not a sin to play in 4 of a major making 6. In fact, if you play it well, or the opponents defend poorly, you may get an excellent board at match points even though you did not score up 1430 or 980. So it is not a sin to miss a slam, even a good one. It happens to everyone, experts included.

What you want to try to avoid is bidding bad slams. You don't want to push for slams. You want to try as hard as possible not to end up at the 5-level, which is no man's land. When in doubt, be content to stop in game. Of course, the best way to have your cake and eat it is with control bids. Some players refer to these as cue bids. I like to call them control bids for the slam tries, but what's in a name? The beauty of control bids is that you make your slam try at an economical level, typically the 4-level. But as you will see, there are some opportunities to make a control bid at the 3-level on a given auction.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, once there is a spade lead, and the diamond finesse works, Liz can count 9 tricks—4 spades 4 diamonds and a heart. The only trick is to make sure she unblocks the diamonds at some point so she can cash dummy's last diamond. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, when you have a blocked suit (e.g the shorter hand has all cards higher than the longer hand), it is a good idea to unblock ASAP. Otherwise, one of your tricks might end up getting stranded.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss the 2@H bid first. It generally promises 4 but with the right hand you can and should raise to 2 with 3-card support. With a singleton and 3-card support you almost always should raise to 2. It is the most encouraging bid you can make. You should always try and support partner when you can. |
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, I like the 2@H bid but it is not as clear, The hand is somewhat balanced so you could justify a 1N bid. But on the plus side for 2@H, having 2 of the top 3 honors is great support and the doubleton spade is worrisome in NT. I personally would not criticize either bid, 1N or 2@H.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, Kadu was a bit lucky in diamonds. The better play is to just hope the @DA is onside. The way she played it, both the @DQ and @DJ have to be onside, and that is only 25%. Whereas the @DA being onside is 50%. Her play happened to work today, but it will fail more often than it will work. Regardless, a 4-3 fit is always hard to play.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand double would work better. But in general, I find with 5-4 in the majors you are usually better off overcalling rather than doubling. And on this hand, obviously with my singleton diamond, a double is problematical as I don't want partner bidding 2@D. But in general, even had jay opened 1@D (in which case I can tolerate a club bid by partner) I still prefer bidding 1@H to making a takeout double.|mb|1H|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well done. In general, 2nd  hand low even applies to declarer, especially on opening lead. Once she ducks the heart, even if spades split 5-3, she will only lose 6 tricks at worst, and can count 7 sure tricks once the @HK is gone.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Kadu made the lead I recommend. Remember "you never lose the post mortem by leading partners suit." Occasionally there will be a better lead but a) you have to know when that is, and that is hard and b) you have to know what suit it is. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some experts would lead the @DK with Kadu's hand. That is ok, but not great, as that is declarer's long suit. I never criticize my partner for leading my suit. The rare times it turns out wrong, so be it. Even on this hand it was not wrong.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me count my Bergen Dummy Points. This is one of those hands where HCP are a minor part of how good my hand is. Remember, on many hands when you have a fit, distribution is equally or more important than HCP. Anyhow, I have 6 HCP, 1 length point, and my void is worth however many trumps I have, which in this case is 4. So my 6 HCP hand is worth 11 dummy points, almost twice as much as what the HCP indicate.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's go over some basic rules as to when you accept on a limit raise. Again distribution is key. If you always bid 4 with a singleton or void, that will work out nicely more often than not, regardless of how many declarer points you have. If you have 14 declarer point, you should also bid 4, but that may sometimes go down when partner has a min limit raise.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Kadu has a borderline hand and 3@D is ok. In IMP I would just bid 4@S and hope we make, as Kadu does have 14 Bergen Points (13 HCP and 1 length point). In IMPS you stretch to bid games, especially vul.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would bid 4@S with Kadu's hand knowing that it might be iffy because even a 40% game is reasonable. In live bridge, Match Points, where the game bonus is not as important, I would probably bid 3@D and blame partner if we got to the wrong contract :). Here, I am not sure over 3@D what to do. I could pass the buck back to kadu and bid 3@S. But hands with voids often work well.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another notable point is I usually stretch in bidding games with 9-card fits, and am conservative with an 8-card fit. on this hand with the spades unfavorable and the @HK off, it has little play.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it was, if either the heart finesse works, or Liz has one of the spade honors, 4@S makes. So it was a pretty reasonable game, I would guess over 50% and certainly over the 40% threshold needed to bid a vul game in IMPs. When analyzing hands, you should not do what is known as "resulting." That means you should not judge how good the contract is based on whether it makes or not. |
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You should judge how good it is based on the percentages. And this one was pretty good, needed 2 of 3 of hearts, spades and diamond finesses which is 50% about. Sometimes, unless you are good in math, it is hard to figure out how likely it is that a contract will make but you should always try. |
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, for those of you who play in clubs, and get the "Deep Finesse" analysis, which tells you what contracts make that is worse than worthless IMO. That is the ultimate in "resulting." It just looks at how the cards are layed out and what makes. But it does not analyze the likelihood of a contract making. So take what Deep Finesse says with a huge grain of salt.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Experts like to overcall at the 2-level only with opening points and 6-card suits, or very good 5 card suits. At the 1-level, experts often overcall with 7 or 8 points. Kadu certainly has a good 5-card suit but she does not have opening points. However, she does have some other assets. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|She has a singleton, which I always like. And her 4 spades are somewhat of an asset believe it or not because since Jay opened 1@S, there are at least 9 spades between Kadu and Jay.

^-{    Beginner Intermediate Lounge     }
^-|fp||ht|c|at|^b@2Maureen Hall (hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

- Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players.
- Where beginner and intermediate players could get to meet and practice together. 
-Where those serious about improving could  have one-on-one lessons with a Mentor 

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily,- Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Team Matches, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite and more.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lesson and  help notes became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. 

Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

In 2013 , in order to offer more opportunities for study, the BIL now operates from two sites.  
1. the BILies Retreat in the BBO Public Clubs, where the open teaching and practice sessions and specials event are held. A place for members to bring their non BIL friends.  
2. The LearnBrdge Classroom in the BBO Private Club section where level restricted, pre-registered, topic specific Courses are held

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.|
