^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nanda is between a 1@S and 2@S bid. I would probably pick 2@S, but that is a tad aggressive. 1@S is a tad conservative.|

I could be starting a spade or diamond slam sequence or I could be looking for 3N. My next bid clarifies why I bid 2@C.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@H is not exactly a "closeout". It simply says I have 5 hearts and nothing more than the min game force I said I had when I bid 2@C. And now North can bid 4N.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Many players would take the spade finesse right away. And most of the time it would not matter. But when the opponents lead a suit you have bid, you need to be suspicious. Although it is unlikely, it could be a singleton. Since I can make 6 without the spade finesse working, I will be safe after drawing trumps.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Notice that by counting winners, the losers took care of themselves. I always count winners. I know some teachers say to count losers, but I think counting winners is easier and more effective. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A couple of final points on the bidding. Nanda is between a 1@S and 2@S bid. If her hearts and clubs had been reversed, I would recommend 1@S. But with such nice hearts, there is good potential we have a heart fit, so I would upgrade the hand slightly and bid 2@S.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once Nanda chooses to bid 1@S, which as I said is certainly a reasonable alternative and I bid 2@C (4th suit forcing) now she can afford to go slow. she can find out why I bid 2@C by bidding 2@H and even if I bid 4@H she can then do RKCB.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I might, for example, bid 3@D over 2@H which would be a slam try in diamonds. Or I might bid 2@S over 2@H which would be a slam try in hearts. The reason those would be slam tries, especially 2@S, is because if I just wanted to go to game, I could bid something else. For example, if I had 4 spades and a min game force, I would bid 4@S over 1@S.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, if the auction (on a different hand) goes 1@D-1@H-1@S-2@C-2@H-2@S where I bid 4th suit forcing before raising spades that shows a stronger hand than simply bidding 4 spades. This is just another example of the "fast arrival" principle. |
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The faster you bid game, the weaker your hand, the less likely you are interested in slam. If you establish a game force (by bidding 4th suit forcing in this case) and then raise partner, that shows a stronger hand and slam interest.|

PG| ***** 37 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, it could mean many things. The 2 most common things it means is a) I am looking for 3 card support or b) I am looking for NT if you have a stopper in the 4th suit. But it could mean other things as well, as I said. Usually, the next bid by the 4th suit forcing hand tells partner what is going on.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I had the same hand but a 5th heart instead of a 5th diamond, I would bid 3@H, but here I will just bid 2@H. It is not clear what the LOTT bid is here. I could be violating it, but if partner has 4 diamonds, then we should be at the 3-level.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally I do not like to lead unprotected aces. However, here it is not a bad play. Whenever partner supports you, it is less likely to be a bad lead. And in this case, we have essentially bid the other 3 suits since nanda's double implied spades. So a spade and diamond lead are out. Don's other choice is the @HA, but that might cost a trick also. So I think I would have chosen a club as well.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW recently Kia started to convert "Learn to Play Bridge 2" by Fred Gitelman so all can enjoy it using only a browser using my Viewer. The first two sections deal with opening leads. One of the things it says which I agree completely with is "although there are opening lead principles, there are no guarantees that your opening lead will be the best one." Opening leads are probably the least scientific and hardest part of bridge which doesn't mean there aren't principles. |
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Just because you make what is theoretically the best opening lead, it does not mean it is the best lead for the particular hand. However, if you follow the principles, then more of your opening leads will work out well than if you don't follow them.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 3rd seat, you strain to preempt. In fact, a weak 2 with a 5-card suit is not unreasonable if you have unbalanced distribution meaning you have a singleton or void.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Against a really good pair, I would even consider opening 2@S with my hand, but because I am flat, only have a 5-card suit, and am vul, I will (somewhat reluctantly) pass. Some might open a light 1S, but I don't like light 1-level 3rd seat openers.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me address the 1N opener by Nanda. She does not really have a 1N opener. One could argue, using Bergen starting points that Nanda has 15 points, enough to open 1N. However, I don't think I would open 1N with the hand. |
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First of all, with NT openers, that is the one time I tend to use raw HCP more than Bergen evaluation. I won't stretch unless my Bergen points are 2 higher than what I need. |
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I might open a hand with 16 Bergen starting points and only 14 HCP, but I would not open a hand with 14 HCP and 15 Bergen points. |
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further Nanda kind of has a so so hand, her diamond suit is mediocre, Jxx of clubs is somewhat dubious, 2/3 of her points are in her short suits, which is not good.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a reasonable bid. The other bid that Don could consider is double, although with his nice spades that might be worrisome. The reason Don might double is, it is possible, because he is short, that Nanda has a penalty pass of his double (which is takeout). |
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, with his singleton being the @CK, that is less likely because in theory I should have some club honors. Of course on this hand, double might have worked out ok. But once again preempts make the opps guess, and they often guess wrong.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Unfortunately, Don only always has 8 tricks. As I said, I think 3@S was reasonable. In fact, 4@S would not have been out of the question over 3@C.|

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
