^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, 4@S is not a "shut out" bid. It simply shows very good spades and 20 points or so. If, for example, I have 13 points or so, I can still try for slam. But the key point to remember is, although responder is usually "captain" of the auction, occasionally, when opener has a very strong hand, they are responsible for making sure their side gets to game.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, I have only 6 points, and I will pass and that will be the case more often than not. However, as responder I am allowed to look for slam if I have an opening hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Jenny does technically have a pass and many players would pass. However, she has a pretty good hand. On average, when you are in 3rd seat, and there are 2 passes, the average number of HCP between the first 2 bidders is around 16 or so. Jenny has 6, so on average, the first 3 hands will have around 24 or so (16 + 6) which means Liz is likely to have a pretty good hand. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It so  happens on this hand, both Don and I have max passes. But, even so, Liz still has an opening hand. So, your job in 3rd seat, when you know their side has the majority of the points, is to make it difficult for them by preempting if you can. Therefore, even experts who prefer disciplined preempts in 1st and 2nd position (misguided :) :) will preempt with light hands in 3rd seat. In fact, you should even preempt when you have close to an opener if it is appropriate.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And you should preempt a weak 2 with a 5 card suit if you have good distribution (a singleton or void). And favorable vulnerability (you not vul, they vul) makes a preempt even more likely to be a good bid. Most experts would open 2@H in 3rd seat with Jenny's hand, even if they would not in 1st or 2nd seat. Although I don't particularly like opening light at the 1-level, I do like to preempt in 3rd seat.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is not a LOTT bid by Don, but it might cause a problem for us. And in fact does cause me a problem. I have 2 sure tricks. In general I can count on Liz, who has at least an opener, to have at least 2 tricks. So in Match Points I might double and hope we can't make game. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But in IMPs I would be worried. I have no good action. I am going to assume (incorrectly as it turns out) that they have an 8 or 9 card heart fit, meaning Liz is short in hearts.  it is more likely she has more than 5 spades. I could bid 4 spades, but that might be too aggressive. So I will content myself with 3 but not happy about it.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you see, the preempt made life difficult for Liz and I. Don does not really have a 3@H bid by the LOTT, but it worked out. So remember to be very aggressive with your preempts in 3rd seat. In fact, with a hand with good distribution, you should open 1 more than you would normally. |
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, last night, at favorable vul, I held @S _ @HQJ109xxx @Dxx @CQxxx. Normally I would open that 3@H but I opened it 4 in 3rd seat and caused the opponents to miss a slam that would have been easy to bid had I not preempted 4. The reason I opened it 4 is because I had the ideal preempt. No defense, great distribution, favorable vul.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I have to decide what I am going to do. By LOTT my bid is 3@S and my choices are 2@S, 3@S, and 4@S. Let me explain the plusses and minuses of each.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@S shows my spade length (4+) and says I have less than a limit raise—Law of Total Tricks. That means, in a competitive auction, you bid to the level equal to the number of trump your side has.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because Jenny has 5 spades (at least) and I have 4 spades, I know we have a 9-card fit, so 3@S is the bid based on the Law of Total Tricks. And that is always the best guideline to use. I would expect most of my students to bid 3@S and that would be fine. I am just explaining some tactical considerations as to why you might consider 2@S or 4@S. |
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over 3@S, if they bid 4@H, I would bid 4@S and that is likely to happen on this hand. But I would be worried I pushed them into a game that might not make (although not too worried).|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


mb|4S|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That says I might bid 4@S right away just to make it harder for the opps to figure out what to do As a general rule, if you have at least 9 spades, and they bid 4@H, you should almost always bid 4@S. Some experts say that "4@S is automatic" in that situation. I also might bid 2@S, hoping that they have a game but wont bid it, because if West bids 3@H, East might not bid 4@H|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@S is not likely to work out particularly well, especially if we can make 3@S and I pass 3@H (which is what I would do if I only bid 2@S). I have to be consistent. If I bid 2@S, I would do so hoping to talk them out of 4@H, so bidding 2@S then 3@S makes no sense whatsoever. So because I have a singleton heart, and we are not vul, I am going to bid 4@S and hope that it is right. At the very least, it will give the opps a big problem but as I said, the technically correct bid is 3@S. 4@S is more of a tactical bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That turns out to be the perfect bid in 2 over 1. It says "partner hearts are trump no matter what you have in hearts. Please start control bidding so we can try for slam." 3@H is a very special bid in 2 over 1, just as I described above. Now I am bidding controls, we will end up in some number of hearts.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


mb|p|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It means I have 1st or 2nd round control in spades. Probably the A or K but could be a singleton or void. You should now make a control bid also.|mb|3S|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


mb|p|mb|4D|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally you would bid 4@C to show 2nd round control in clubs. However, because I bid clubs naturally, you do not bid shortness in my suit when you are control bidding. So 4@D is the correct control bid, since, because I bid 2@C, you would only control bid 4@C with the @CA or @CK, not a singleton or void.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


mb|p|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since I know we have all suits controlled, its just a matter of how many key cards we have. Except I guess we have a problem. If Jenny bids 5@S, we are forced to be in 6@H. The reason I can't bid 4N is if she only has 2 key cards and the @HQ, we are missing 2 key cards but she will bid 5@S.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I will teach you an advanced form or RKCB which solves this problem. It is called Kickback RKCB. So for this hand only, to demonstrate kickback I will bid 4@S. Your answers are:

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Technically I don't have an opening hand (does not meet the rule of 20) and I normally don't like to open light in 3rd seat. But because I just about have an opening hand, and we might be able to compete in spades, I am going to open. Some people use the "rule of 15" to determine whether or not to open in 3rd seat (and sometimes 4th seat).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The rule of 15 says you should not open at the 1-level in 3rd seat unless your HCP + number of spades is 15 or more. By the rule of 15 I have 11 HCP + 4 spades = 15, just enough to open. However, having said that, I don't believe in the rule of 15, lol. I just open opening hands that meet the rule of 20 in all seats.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Liz has no good lead. That's as good as anything. However, in general leading away from jxx or Qxx often gives away a trick, so you should avoid it when you can. But in this case, a club is the least of evils lead.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My plan is to take the diamond finesse and ruff 2 clubs in dummy. I will duck a spade, and win the 2nd spade after taking the diamond finesse.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|These intermediate unbalanced openers are always the hardest to bid. They are not strong enough to jump shift with on the rebid, so you have to make a slight underbid (had Liz passed).|
pg| ***** 119 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay bidding so far other than Jenny should have opened 2@H. As to Don's 3@S bid. So long as you have the agreement that it simply shows 4-card spade support and does not promise any points (which is what I play) he can bid 3@S. That it is a LOTT bid but it would also be reasonable to play that you don't make an LOTT bid unless you have at least 6 points (or you are jumping to 4. However, I play the way Don bid it, that 3@S simply shows 4 spades and can be done with very few HCP.|
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once again, 4@S over 4@H is "automatic." I would not bid 5@H with jenny's hand. It might be right, but let me explain what criteria to use. Generally, "the 5 level belongs to the opps." What that means is it is rarely right to bid "5 over 5." For example, if I were deciding whether or not to bid 5@S over 5@H, generally I should not bid it. But "5 over 4" is more complicated. |
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The most compelling reason to bid 5 over 4 is shortness in the opps suit (e.g. a singleton or void) which Jenny does not have. That is the single most important factor. Not vul against vul, I might do it anyway if I think they are making 4.|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So based on those 2 factors, Jenny should not bid 5@H. However, she does know they have an 11-card fit and the LOTT is not quite as accurate above the 4-level. But the 11-card fit in and of itself is not a reason to bid 5. On the other hand, at any vul but unfavorable, I would bid 5H with an 11-card fit over 4@S.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You need to lead a spade Don even though on this hand a diamond works fine. We want to make sure we take spades before they are discarded if we can.|pc|S8|

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.|
