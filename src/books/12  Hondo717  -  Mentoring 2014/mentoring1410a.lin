|CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/5vo9kx^*N
^-|CP||va|4|AT|^b@2^*B11^*N. A 2NT response to a takeout double shows 10-12 HCP and is not forcing. A 1NT response to a takeout double shows 6-9 HCP similar to a 1NT response to an opening bid. Notrump responses to a takeout double guarantee at least one stopper (hopefully two), in the opponents' suit.

You hold: @S KJ9x @H xx @D Q10x @C Jxxx (or AJxx)
^CWest ^ENorth ^gEast ^iSouth (you)
^C1@S ^EDbl. ^gPass ^i?
With the @C Jxxx, respond 1NT. With the @C AJxx, respond 2NT. You don't need stoppers in the other suits. Partner is supposed to have them for the double.

^*B12^*n. If you play "five-card majors", a short diamond should only be opened with 4-4 in the majors, three diamonds and two clubs. The incidence of a 1@D opening bid with this exact distribution is less than 3%. Translation: When partner opens 1D, assume partner has four or more diamonds.

^*B13^*n. After partner opens the bidding and second hand overcalls 1NT to show the strength of an opening 1NT bid, double for penalty if you have 9 or more HCP. Bidding a suit denies the strength to double.

You hold: @S 10x @H KJxx @D AJxxx @C J10
^CNorth ^eEast ^gSouth (you) ^jWest
^C1@S ^e1NT ^g?
Double. You have them outgunned. You should be able to defeat 1NT easily. If you bid 2D, you are showing fewer than 9 HCP with at least five diamonds, usually six.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First let me discuss the play and then the bidding. On the diamond opening lead, Don can count 8 sure tricks, 7 hearts and a diamond. If Liz has the @CA that gets him up to 9 tricks with the @CK.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|His only shot at a 10th trick is if someone has Axx or Ax of spades and the @SK sets up.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So he wins the 2nd heart in dummy and plans to ruff 3 low spades hoping the SA will show up. When it doesn't, he hopes the @CA is onside so only down 1. That is the way to plan the hand out. Next is the comments on the bidding.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Don has a perfectly good 3@H bid and that is what most people would open and I have no objection to that. However, with that nice hearts and great distribution and not being vul, I would open 4@H personally.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think Liz has a clear pass over 3@H.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have a law of total tricks (10 card fit) 4 heart bid. Remember, on almost any hand where your partner preempts, the law of total tricks determines whether and how high you should raise.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over 4@H, I reluctantly pass with Jenny's hand. But I am worried we should be in 4@S. The problem is, South is the only one at the table who knows what is going on. South's 4@H bid could be based on a good hand, or simply furthering the preempt. There is no way for East West to know.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it turns out, they make 4@S. I think they lose one @H, one @S and one @C. The losing diamond goes on the @CJ. However, my raise to 4@H made it difficult for them to bid it which is why I recommend aggressive preempting. because more good things happen when you preempt than bad things.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even if you play 2 over 1, you need to decide if that is forcing by a passed hand. I like to play it is. I think it definitely should be if you don't play Drury, because otherwise you have a problem with a 3-card limit raise.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, many people (probably a majority) play it as either "semi-forcing" (I will explain that) or "non-forcing". Non-forcing is obvious. Semi-forcing means that Jenny passes with 5-3-3-2 distribution and 12-14. In other words if she bids 2@C or 2@D and you play semi-forcing, that shows a 4-card suit.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I like to play it forcing in any case, because I often have hands where I want to bid. For example with Liz's hand, I want to end up in clubs. So no matter what Jenny bids, I am bidding 3@C with Liz's hand. Nevertheless, it is absolutely by partnership agreement.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I bid it is what is known as a "free bid". That means I don't have to bid with a not so great hand since my partner will get another chance. However, just because I bid does not mean I have a good hand (although that's what some people think a free bid requires). |
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A bid by me simply means I have something useful to say to partner. And since I can redouble, it certainly does not show strength, just length or high cards in the suit bid. On this particular hand I have nothing I want to tell Jenny.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@C by Liz after her earlier double, a double and correct, is showing a nice hand 16+ and nice clubs, usually a 6+ card suit. It is not forcing but highly encouraging.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


mb|p|mb|2H|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Don's bid is definitely forcing—new suit by responder. As to whether or not I would bid with Don's hand, its close. Liz could have a strong hand with hearts and clubs or even possibly 3 spades. |
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But the hand could also be a misfit. Don is certainly not completely broke (he theoretically could have 0 points since the double forced him to bid). But he does not have a great hand. So I like 2@H but would not quarrel with a pass by Don either.|

a) they might only have an 8-card fit

^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
