On November 5, 2014, to celebrate the successful six months mentoring sessions for Liz, Jenny and Don Howard invited an exciting Dimweddie to celebrate the occasion. She graciously performed Belly dancing on the virtual table which was captured by our film crew.

We are presenting the virtual Belly dancing as our gift to Liz, Jenny, and Don. Please click the link below and watch the dance before you begin the mentoring session movie.

The dance has two parts and we strongly suggest to have a bucket of ice nearby if you intend to watch the second part. When done please click the "Next Page" arrow to proceed.

^-|CP||va|4|AT|^b@2^*B34^*N. When discarding, keep length parity with the dummy.
If dummy has four cards in a suit (A-K-Q-8), and you have four cards (9-4-3-2) one of which (the 9) could conceivably take a trick, be careful about discarding from that suit. Be very careful! Don't!

^*B35^*n. It is important to count declarer's tricks as the play progresses. If you find yourself on lead and can see that declarer has enough tricks in three suits to make the contract, shift to the fourth suit. Some chance is better than no chance.

^*B36^*n. When dummy tables, add declarer's likely point count to dummy's known point count.
The bidding has gone 1NT-3NT. Partner leads and dummy has 10 HCP. Say the opponents are playing a 15-17 notrump range. Assume declarer has the middle count, 16, and proceed from there. The opponents have 26 HCP, give or take 1 point, leaving you and partner with 14. You know how many you have, so it is easy enough to figure out how many partner has. Do it!

^*B37^*n. When defending a suit contract, there are two main techniques declarer uses to garner extra tricks: 
(1) setting up a long suit in dummy, 
(2) ruffing losers in the short hand (usually the dummy.) 

If dummy comes down with a long and a short suit and you have the long suit bottled up, lead trumps because the long suit is not usable. If it appears that the long suit is usable, play an attacking defense going for outside tricks quickly. If the dummy comes down balanced, declarer has no place to get rid of losers and will eventually lose them, therefore you and partner should adopt a passive defense. Avoid breaking new suits if possible. Let them have what they have coming. Sit back and wait for your tricks. Your day will come.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not an easy hand to play. Don did the best he could once I made him take the heart finesse. After winning the third trick he hand a critical play to make the contract. But it is not easy to find.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Regardless, I see many inexperienced players decide a finesse is going to lose and therefore not take the finesse. That is just plain silly. If the finesse loses, it will lose whether you take it or not. But sometimes it wins so you might as well try. If you don't try it will never win.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So far as the auction goes. I would have opened 3@H with Don's hand. Many would not because of his outside A and lack of top heart honors. But I would open 3@H even if he lacked the @CA. That heart suit, with its @H10 and @H9 is a perfectly good suit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I may have encouraged Jenny a little too much :). But nicely played. Let's talk a little about when to compete at the 3 level. It is sort of the magic level. You never want to let the opponents stop at the 2 level when they have a known fit. So you strain to compete over their 2 level contract.|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But once you get to the 3-level, you have done your job. You should only bid 3 over 3 with

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand theoretically we can beat 3@D although it is likely it makes. Jenny would have to lead a spade and she is probably leading either a club or a diamond. So Sandy's spade losers are going away on the @CK and the @HK. And they end up making 4, losing 1 spade and 2 diamonds.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's count Don's Dummy Points. He has a terrific hand. 16 HCP, + 2 length points, + 1 (possibly 2 using strict Bergen guideline. But the @S10 is doubleton.) for 4 aces and two 10 and no quacks, and + 3 for the singleton = 22 Dummy Points. 4@H is actually a slight underbid but the best he can do. Please note the 4@H is not a shut out bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nicely played Sandy. Hands like this are psychologically tricky. It is much easier for most people to set up their hand than to set up dummy. If Sandy had held Don's hand most people would have figured out to set up diamonds. But when Don's hand is dummy many people have trouble visualizing setting up dummy.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I once did the following experiment when I was doing the BIL puzzles. I had a hand where you needed to set up a long suit, like this hand, in order to make. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Then I waited a few months and presented the exact same hand, except I put the long suit in dummy and most people could not visualize how to play the hand. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So keep that in mind when you are declaring. Although more often than not you set up your own hand. Sometimes you have a hand where it is right to set up dummy like this hand.|

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
