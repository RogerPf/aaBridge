CP||AT|^c@2^Y@3^*B1. When partner bids two suits and you have an equal number of cards in each suit, take partner back to the first suit even if it means increasing the level. Just do it!

You hold: @S Axxx @H K10x @D Jxx @C xxx
Partner You
1@D ^e1@S
2@H ^e?
^eBid 3@D. Raising hearts (see next tip) or passing partner's reverse, a one-round force, 
^eputs you back in kindergarten.
^c@2^Y@32. A direct raise of a second suit promises four card support (in blood).

You hold: @S xx @H A10x @D A10x @C K10xxx
Partner You
1@S ^e2@C
2@H ^e?
^eRebid 2NT showing 11-12 high-card points. Don’t even thinking of raising hearts with 
^eonly three. DONE |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For the opening lead either the @C10 or a low heart would be a reasonable lead. I tend to avoid short suit leads, so I probably lead a heart. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, as I said, absent bidding from partner, I lead my longest unbid suit in NT contracts. As it turns out the @C10 does in fact set up a club trick for Jenny.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, Jenny now has 3 hearts, 3 diamonds and a club for sure. And she can still set up another spade and/or another club.|

jennyecu:  I was just reading your lesson about covering an honor with an honor.  Just thought I shouldn't then.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The basic principle is, if it can gain you a trick you should. In this case, if you play the @CQ and if Liz plays the @CK, then with your @C98 you can knock out the @CJ and win another trick. |
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand if Liz doesn't play the @CK, your @CQ wins. So by covering with the @CQ you guarantee at least 2 club tricks.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Without the @C98 it would not be right to cover. Covering an honor with an honor is pretty complicated. It is impossible to memorize every possible situation. You have to just develop the bridge logic to figure out when it helps you establish another trick and when it does not.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT|^B@2
jennyecu:  I guess what I was doing was playing second hand low.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Your instincts were reasonable and that is right more often than not. Without the @C98 low would have been a good play.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would pass with Liz's hand. First of all she is not sure how many spades my 2@D bid promises. I might be doing it with 3 card support. In that case the Law of Total Tricks says you should not bid 3 over 3 with only 8 trump.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Liz should only bid 3 over 3 with a known 9-card fit or a singleton diamond. In this hand, she has a diamond value that might be valuable on defense but is probably not worth has much on offense and she has a flat hand. So there is no reason to bid 3@S.|mb|p|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One minute please. Let's discuss the heart suit. You most likely have a heart loser. Playing the @HQ there is no distribution of the cards where you will not lose a heart trick. If Don has the @HK he will cover and you will lose the @H10. And if Jenny has the @HK you will lose the finesse.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


up||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, there is one distribution of the heart cards where you will lose no hearts. If someone has a singleton HK, you will win 3 heart tricks.  And that is the only distribution where you can win 3 heart tricks.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Don, you are "captain" meaning you are in charge of the bidding. Does your side have game? You have an opening hand. Jenny has an opening hand. |
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore you have at least 26 points between you, enough for game. You know that. Jenny does not know that. So you have to bid game, or at least make a forcing bid that Jenny cannot pass.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case, you know you have a spade game and not a spade slam. You have about 16 or 17 Bergen Declarer points. Jenny has no more than 15 points. with more she would bid 3@S.|mb|4s|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So 4@S is the contract which you expect to make easily. Remember, responder is almost always captain. when responder knows their side has enough for game, it is up to responder to take charge and make sure the partnership gets to game.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With a weak hand and 5 spades, the Law of Total Tricks says bid 4 spades with your 10 card fit. With 4 spades, given that we are not vul I think 4@S is a good bid. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But Don's flat distribution could argue for the more conservative 3@S bid.|

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
