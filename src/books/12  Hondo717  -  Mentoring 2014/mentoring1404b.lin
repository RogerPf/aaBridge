^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good double by Babs, particularly since she is a passed hand. I know for sure she must have a little less than an opener. Had Kia passed, she probably would have been a little light for a takeout double (as that promises an opener). But these days the tendency is to make light takeout doubles, so some might have doubled with her hand even had she not passed originally.|mb|d|mb|p|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Theoretically, because I have 10 points I could jump, but I am discounting for the @HJ and my 4-3-3-3 distribution. If I had a 5th club (which also gives me an extra length point), I would have bid 3@C.|mb|2C|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I hate to give it to Kia in 2@H, as it is very likely they have an 8-card fit. Babs double shows heart shortness. So they rate to have at least an 8-card fit. But 3@C seems too pushy, especially since it is quite possible that Babs only has 3-card support.|mb|p|NT|^B@2

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Theoretically, the @C3 should show an honor. Remember, you lead attitude in partner's "supported" suit. You might be thinking "well Babs did not support clubs, so she should lead count according to Howard." However, she actually did implicitly support clubs by making a takeout double, which promises at least 3 cards in the unbid suits. Therefore, attitude leads are correct here. If, for example, we switch the @CJ and @C6, giving Kia the stiff @CJ and Babs the C964, she should lead the 9.|pc|C3|

foxyausy:  Howard, re bidding - my logic on pass was because Babs promised spade, I could not redouble with my holding so I figured I had a second chance to bid anyway following her double.  Is this thought process flawed?  Bidding 1N did cross mind.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The general rule is, the double relieves responder of having to bid even with 6 or 7 points. So responder should only bid if they have something useful to say. For example, if they have a 5 card suit or a good 4 card suit they should bid. Or they can bid 1NT which shows something slightly stronger than the normal 6-10 1N would say had Babs passed.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As Gail, I would have bid 1N with her hand to show that I am not completely broke--having 8-10. If we change the hand around, such that one of the kings was in the club suit, e.g you have K Q 8 7 5 of clubs you might bid 2@C. The auction 1@H-dbl-2@C denies 10 points. Many less experience people don't know that. You always redouble with 10 points, so any bid other than redouble (or 2N which is Jordan and shows a limit raise) denies 10 points.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1@S is a perfectly reasonable bid, and one that most people would have made. However, in 3rd seat, especially at favorable vul (you not vul, the opponents vul) you should strain to preempt. So, on another hand, 2@S would not be an unreasonable bid. Once partner passes the odds of your side having game are much less. And the odds are much better that 4th seat has a good hand (although that is not true on this particular deal).|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Preempting in 3rd seat, even with a min opener is not a bad tactic. However, as we can see, Kia's hand is not a min opener. You should no more than 13 or a bad 14 Bergen starting points to consider a preempt. Kia has 12 HCP, 2 length points and 1 quality suit point for 15, and 1@S is better.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1NT is the bid that most would make with Kia's hand including me. But Marty Bergen would argue his hand is too strong for 1N opener. His Bergen Starting Points are 17 plus 1 length plus 1 quality suit plus 1 adjust 3 v(4 aces/10 and only 1 quack) for a total of 20. So Bergen would argue his hand is closer to a 2N bid than a 1N bid, but would probably say it is acceptable to open 1@D intending to jump to 2N.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general I use straight HCP to decide how much my hand is worth in NT. But I also count my Starting Points, and if they are off by 2 or more then I adjust. For example, on this hand, because I have 3 more starting points than HCP, I would consider it worth a 1@D opener followed by a 2N (18-19) rebid.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I count my Bergen Starting Points. If my starting point count comes to 19 or more, I then consider the hand too strong to open 1N--I am 2 points more than an opening 1N bid. Similarly, it is possible that I have a very quacky hand with 15 HCP but that only counts to 13 Starting Points. In that case, I would consider the hand too weak to open 1N.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once again, bidding an aggressive 3N would have worked out. Keep that in mind the next time you are tempted to pass a 2N 18-19 rebid. again I only pass if I have 5 or 6 Bergen Starting points, and sometimes I even bid 3N with 6 Bergen Starting points if I have some 10s and 9s.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a good bid by Gail. My 2nd choice is 1N. Yes Gail doesn't like her doubleton heart, but you should rebid 1N when you can't raise partner and you have 12-14 balanced even if 1 unbid suit is not stopped.|mb|2S|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me see how many declarer points I have. 9 HCP, -1 for dubious diamond doubleton giving me 8. The 2@S bid promises at most 15 Bergen Dummy Points, more likely less. Therefore, we have no chance at game. If you use Bergen hand evaluation, usually your bidding decisions are pretty easy on noncompetitive auctions.|

^-{    Beginner Intermediate Lounge     }
^-|fp||ht|c|at|^b@2Maureen Hall (hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

- Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players.
- Where beginner and intermediate players could get to meet and practice together. 
-Where those serious about improving could  have one-on-one lessons with a Mentor 

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily,- Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Team Matches, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite and more.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lesson and  help notes became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. 

Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

In 2013 , in order to offer more opportunities for study, the BIL now operates from two sites.  
1. the BILies Retreat in the BBO Public Clubs, where the open teaching and practice sessions and specials event are held. A place for members to bring their non BIL friends.  
2. The LearnBrdge Classroom in the BBO Private Club section where level restricted, pre-registered, topic specific Courses are held

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|1|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
