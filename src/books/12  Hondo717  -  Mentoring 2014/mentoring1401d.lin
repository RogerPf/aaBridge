^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't normally recommend Drury, but we can do it on this hand as a teaching tool. It turns out you still have a 2@C bid even if you do not play Drury. If you play 2 Way Reverse Drury, then 2@C and 2@D over 1@H or 1@S are artificial bids.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@C shows a 3 card limit raise, and 2@D shows a 4 card limit raise. If opener rebids his suit, that means they have a light opener and any other bidshowed a real opener. If opener bids a new suit it is a game try. Also, 1NT is no longer forcing. This is only when opener is in 3rd or 4th seat.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


mb|2C|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@C bid by Gail shows a 3 card limit raise. If you play Drury then 3@C no longer is a Bergen limit raise (or 3@D if playing regular Bergen). Both are replaced by 2@D. Also, if responder is a passed hand they can't have a game forcing hand. You could decide to play 1N forcing, but it is no longer needed. It is only semi forcing.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me count my declarer points. I have 11 HCP, 1 length point, 2 points for singleton, and 1 point for 4 card club suit for 15 Declarer Points. Gail promising a limit raise (10-12) with 3 card support. Therefore, in IMPs I would bid 4@H but in Match Points I would bid 3@H to invite 4@H and Gail would accept the invite since she has a maximum (12).|mb|4H|

But if they are 4-1 I have to guess who is more likely to have 4. If I decide Kia is more likely (which I will to illustrate the play), then I lead a low club to the ace.If I decide Babs is more likely to have 4, then I cash the @CJ, intending to finesse her for the 10 if she started with 4.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So we discussed why Gail had a good pass and how to play Drury. Without Drury, we still get to 4 because it goes 1@H-2@C-3@C-3@H-4@H. My only other comment is Kia should consider playing a diamond when in with the HA. That way he might run me out of trump prematurely. It turns out not to matter because he only had 3 diamonds and both the CK and SA.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There were definitely some bidding issues here. Let us discuss the bidding. Kia can choose not to open 2@D, that is a matter of style and bidding 2@D over 2@C is a good bid. In fact he could bid 2@D over 1@C. And it is fine for Gail to bid 3@C, despite my pass (showing a min 2@C bid) because she knows we have at least a 9 card fit. |
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Babs should not bid 3@D. Kia might even have a 5 card suit, but even if he has a 6 card suit, LOTT says not to bid 3 over 3 with an 8 card fit. So Gail has a clear pass of 3@D. She has a flat hand, and some defense. In 3@D they probably lose 3 diamonds (due to my @D10), 3 spades and a club down 3.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So East/West should be thankful that 4@C bid turned a plus for us into a minus. It is almost never right to bid 4 of a minor over 3.|

foxyausy:  Howard.. sorry to go back on last hand... to support minors regardless of strength one only needs 4?  I have always played 5.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|To make a jump raise (1C-P-3C or 1D-P-3D), you definitely need 5. But to make a 10+ raise (1C-P-2C, 1D-P-2D) you only need 4. I am not a big fan of 1C/1D-P-2N. It takes up too much bidding room. I much prefer making an inverted raise to 2. And I think bidding 1C/1D-3N is even worse. You could easily miss slam if opener is strong.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, if she passes she is denying 3 card support. If Gail passed (on a different hand with only 2 spades), then Kia could redouble to "retransfer". So a lead directing double by the opponents can sometimes help the opposition. But the upside of helping partner find a good lead is worth it although in this case a heart is not such a good lead.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well done Gail. As far as the bidding is concerned the 4@H was correct. Some player's with East hand might think about slam.  East has 21 Dummy Points (18 HCP, 1 length point, 1 quality suit point, plus 1 for doubleton). Granted, once they find a fit, although Gail is limited to 10 HCP, adding declarer points she could be up to 12 or even a bit more.|

Theoretically he could open 1@S. But I tend to be careful when I meet the rule of 20 with 10 or fewer HCP. Tactically, I often think a preempt is better. On this hand, Kia has no defense outside of spades. So I prefer 3@S to 1@S, although 1@S could be justified.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's see how we do in 5@S. We lose a spade and a diamond for sure. We may not lose a heart because Kia may get to pitch his heart on my last diamond. So it turns out we might make 5@S. Therefore, Kia would not have been infamous after all :).|

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|1|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
