^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I would have doubled with Kia's hand just to let pard know I have hearts. It is true he has a preference for a club lead, but normally an overcall at the 2-level shows a good 5-card suit at least. These days people are overcalling nice 4 card suits at the 1 level. So if for example Kia had AKQx of spades and the auction went 1@D-P-1@H-?, 1@S would be acceptable with AKQx. Although personally, since I am a big LOTT  advocate I tend to shy away from 4-card overcalls.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, on this hand, I think due to the fact that Kia has hearts and only 4 clubs, double is somewhat better than 2@C. But 2@C is better than pass. And 2@D by Gail is a good bid as well.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Gail made what is called a "Balancing NT." A direct 1NT overcall (e.g. if I had bid 1NT) shows a strong NT. A "Balancing NT", e.g a 1NT bid after 2 passes, shows 11-14 and always a stopper if opener bid a major, and at least sort of a stopper if opener opened 1 of a minor.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|All systems are still on over the Balancing NT, but the point counts have to be adjusted to take into account that the 1N bidder is showing 11-14.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Too bad.  Had I chosen to bid 2@C we end up in 2@H which probably makes. But Gail did the best she could in 1NT. It turns out the @C9 works better at trick 1, but the odds favor playing the @CJ.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is an interesting point by amare2. But on a diamond lead, you might be able to run East out of spades before clubs are set up. However, on the surface, E/W only have 3 losers (2 clubs and 1 diamond) and they certainly make 2 or 3 spades.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As most of you know, I play any bid but redouble (or Jordan 2N) shows less than 10 points. However, many people play that 1 level bids, although they can be made (and often are) with less than 10 points are forcing and are unlimited in strength over a takeout double, as if the takeout doubler had passed. I don't like that but that is a very common way to play.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also, accordingly, if I made a 2 level bid (e.g. I bid 2@C) that is less than 10 points. So the common way to play is that 1-level bids are potentially stronger than 2-level bids. I find that rather confusing for most people which is why I like my simpler style of any bid other than redouble is less than 10.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, the question is should I treat my hand as 10 points (it only has 9 HCP) but I could add 1 for the quality heart suit. On the other hand, I am not sure if we want to play in diamonds, hearts, or spades, so I will make a slightly light redouble.|mb|r|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now Gail can bid, and any bid she makes is weak. Kia has opened, her partner has shown an opener, I have shown 10+, so Gail cannot possibly have many points. By passing Gail is asking her partner to pick her best suit. On this hand Gail's best bid would have been 2@C. Remember 2@C does not show any values, simply a preference for clubs.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But I am not one of those. The issue is that the forcing 1NT is not available over 1@D. So when you have a 10 or 11 point hand with clubs, you are stuck for a bid over 1@D. So I play that 2@C over 1@D is the same as in SAYC. But if you prefer 2@C being a game force Babs, that is fine with me.|mb|2C|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Of course on this hand, we have a very bad misfit, so 3N is going to be very difficult. I should develop a plan before playing to trick 1. I can count 2 hearts 2 spades and 2 clubs for sure. If the @SQ is onside that gives me 8 tricks because I will get 2 more spades. So I have to find another trick.|

A kib:  if Kia were not in Westeros -:) |CP|1|AT|^*Hawoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Westeros^*N|CP||AT|, wouldn't the thinking be, there are 4 out so the distribution is likely to 3-1 for partner, since Hondo didn't support?|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is no way for Kia to know I have a singleton @DK. I wouldn't support with 2 diamonds, so I could easily have Kx of diamonds or even Kxx. You know if you play the DQ my 9 will be good.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes I was very lucky. Its  hard for Kia to know what to do at trick 2 which is why I played a diamond early. That is a good principle for you to remember as declarer. You know what you have, but the opponents often do not. So if your only chance is to play for a misdefense, then play for it.|

^-{    Beginner Intermediate Lounge     }
^-|fp||ht|c|at|^b@2Maureen Hall (hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

- Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players.
- Where beginner and intermediate players could get to meet and practice together. 
-Where those serious about improving could  have one-on-one lessons with a Mentor 

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily,- Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Team Matches, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite and more.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lesson and  help notes became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. 

Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

In 2013 , in order to offer more opportunities for study, the BIL now operates from two sites.  
1. the BILies Retreat in the BBO Public Clubs, where the open teaching and practice sessions and specials event are held. A place for members to bring their non BIL friends.  
2. The LearnBrdge Classroom in the BBO Private Club section where level restricted, pre-registered, topic specific Courses are held

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|1|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
