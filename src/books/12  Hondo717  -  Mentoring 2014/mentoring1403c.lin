In other words "Fast Arrival" show a weaker hand than "Slow Arrival." The idea being, that you want more room to explore for slam, but no need to go slow if you just want to bid game.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The auction was pretty straight forward. I have a clear 3@D bid, based on my 9-card fit using LOTT. Leigh has 21 Starting Points -- 19 HCP, 1 length point, 1 quality suit point. The declarer add ons are 2 for singleton and 1 for 4 spades so up to 24. Obviously more than enough to bid 4.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next let us talk about what Kia should lead. Normally leading an unprotected ace is a bad idea, so a diamond is probably not right. On the other hand, given I supported the suit, it is a little better than just leading some random unprotected ace. Regardless, I would not lead a diamond. Further, in general, leading away from an honor is an aggressive lead. It is high risk, high reward. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So normally in suit contract, I don't lead away from an honor unless my partner has bid the suit or I think an attacking lead is called for. For example, I might think, based on the auction that dummy has a long running suit. So, normally I shy away from leading away from an honor. In this hand  trump lead is conceivable as a likely passive lead, although the auction does not particularly call for a trump lead. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So when I have nothing better to lead, I lead a suit with only small cards. As far as I am concerned, the longer the suit the better. Therefore, leading from a 4 or 5 card suit with no honor is best, leading from 3 small is ok, leading from a doubleton is not as desirable. Having said that, however, on this hand, I probably would choose a spade. but it is hardly clear. Here, any of the 4 suits could be right.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The good news was Kia made a bid that worked out, a bid I never would have made. The bad news is he decided to not try and make the contract. So I guess the moral of the story is Kia makes the good bids in this partnership, but he lets me play the hands :)|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now as to how the auction might go. Whenever it goes 1N-P-P-? you should strain to balance no matter how many points you have. The points will tend to be almost evenly spread out (although the NT bidder's side on average will have 21 or 22). In fact, it turns out, in 4th seat, you prefer having a weak hand to a strong hand. the reason is, your side has around 18-20. |
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you have say 4 or 5, partner has 14 or so and partner is the one sitting behind the strong hand. Therefore, although it is far from obvious, the weaker your hand is, the more you should want to balance when the opponent opens 1N.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One another point. I would open 2@H with the West hand. Many people would not a) because of the 4 card spade suit and b) because they don't think their hearts are good enough. But, as most of you know, I think they are wrong. The 4-card major in particular is a "myth". There are very few hands where it is better to play in your 4-card suit when you have a 6-card suit. |
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And also, the reason I don't worry too much about the strength of my suit is because length in general is more important than strength. So pretty much any time I have 5-10 and a 6-card suit, I open a weak 2. But you have to decide what style suits you.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 3@H bid worked well. If Gail had only bid 2@H it would be easier for them to find their game, either 5@C or 3N. 6@C is actually a Great contract, but hard to bid.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would have Babs, but certainly not clear. Another possibility is 3N.You are likely getting a heart lead, and you can count 9 tricks. It is possible that we can take 5 diamonds off the top. But a) I have to lead diamonds, and b) Kia has to have no stopper.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't think that is 100% clear Kia. She is counting on you, based on probabilities for 7 or 8 points, and (discounting your @HQ) that is all you have. And although Babs rates to have nice clubs, your singleton club is not good. |
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I don't think it is clear at all. I wouldn't hate it if you bid 5@C in IMPs but pass is ok too. If I had to assess who should bid 5@C, I would say it is more obvious for Babs to bid it than you. Personally I would have bid 3N with her hand, and crossed my fingers -:). That is most likely to get us the best result.|

mb|2C|mb|d|sk||NT||mb|3C|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I had a question as to whether 3@C violates my competitive guidelines because Gail is only promising 5 clubs so I don't know that we have a 9 card fit and hence don't have an LOTT bid.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, my competitive guidelines work as follows. If they have an 8 card fit, it is ok to bid "3 over 2" with an 8 card fit but it is not ok to bid "3 over 3" unless you either a) have a 9-card fit or b) have a singleton in their suit. In this case I don't "know" they have an 8-card fit, but it is quite likely. I only have 2 hearts so unless Gail has 4 (which is possible but not likely once she shows 5+ clubs) they have an 8-card heart fit. |
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And even if Gail happens to have 4 hearts (as she does on this hand) that means she has 9 cards in clubs and hearts which makes it likely that she has only 2 spades meaning they have an 8 card spade fit. Therefore, I assumed they had an 8 card major suit fit. It wasn't 100% guaranteed but it was likely. Thus, following my competitive guidelines, I could bid 3@C over 2 of their major.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, another sort of rule of thumb is, if partner overcalls at the 2 level and you have 3-card support, it is usually right to raise because 2-level overcalls should only be made with good 5-card suits at worst and often are made with 6-card suits. That does not apply to 1 level overcalls. |
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1 level overcalls can be made on much weaker and suits and are often done with a 5 card suit. In fact, it is becoming fairly popular to make 1-level overcalls with a good 4-card suit (usually AKxx or 3 of the top 5 honors). I don't like to overcall with 4 card suits because it messes up LOTT calculations.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This was a case where you need to "lose your losers" early. Kia wanted to set up a diamond trick before losing his stoppers in the majors. So playing a diamond early was a good idea. He could have run his clubs first, but he should then play diamonds before playing spades.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general overcalling 1N is a better bid than 1@S overcall. You should strain to overcall 1N. However, with such nice spades, and only 15 HCP 1@S is acceptable. Having poor diamonds is irrelevant. Having poor clubs is not however. |mb|1S|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a rare case where a vul sac might work out, but only if Kia guesses the heart suit. Kia has 2 sure diamond losers and one sure heart loser. He will be doubled in 5@S. So he has to hold his heart losers to 1 in order for the sacrifice to be correct. Down 2 doubled is -500 worse than our 400. |
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general you should avoid bidding "5 over 5" especially when vul. For every time it is right (and it rarely is) you will be wrong 3 times. Now as to what Babs should bid if Kia passes. She actually has enough to make a limit raise. So 2@S would not be a bad bid, although tactically 3@C has merit as well.|

^-{    Beginner Intermediate Lounge     }
^-|fp||ht|c|at|^b@2Maureen Hall (hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

- Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players.
- Where beginner and intermediate players could get to meet and practice together. 
-Where those serious about improving could  have one-on-one lessons with a Mentor 

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily,- Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Team Matches, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite and more.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lesson and  help notes became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. 

Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

In 2013 , in order to offer more opportunities for study, the BIL now operates from two sites.  
1. the BILies Retreat in the BBO Public Clubs, where the open teaching and practice sessions and specials event are held. A place for members to bring their non BIL friends.  
2. The LearnBrdge Classroom in the BBO Private Club section where level restricted, pre-registered, topic specific Courses are held

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
