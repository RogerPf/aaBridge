^-|CP||va|4|AT|^B@2^*B43^*N. There is nothing more important than counting your sure tricks before you begin to play. At notrump count your sure tricks outside of the suit you plan to establish. This tells you how many tricks you need in your main suit and then play accordingly.

^*b44^*n. As declarer, when you can to take a trick with one of two equal honors, take the trick with the higher equal. It is far more deceptive.
|VA|4|AT|Say you are playing notrump with the @S KQx. If a low card is led and RHO plays the jack, assuming you wish to take the trick, take it with the king. Do the same with the A-Q-J. If a low card is led and the 10 comes up on your right, take it with the queen, not the jack! If you take tricks with lower equals, you might as well be playing with your cards face up on the table!

Major exception: With A-K-x-(x) at notrump take the first trick with the king. If you win with the ace, it is too suspect. If your only stopper is the ace, why aren't you holding up?

^*b45^*n. As declarer, when possible, withhold any spot card lower than the one that has been led or lower than the one played to your right. If the opponents are playing standard signals, this tip is sure to screw them up. Say the 3 is led against notrump and dummy has the A-K-5 and you have the Q-6-2. You play the king from dummy and third hand plays the 4. If you play the 6, concealing the deuce, consider the confusion you have caused: fourth hand won't know if partner has led from a four- or five-card suit (can't see the deuce) and the opening leader won't know if partner is signaling with something like Q-4-2. (can't see the deuce). If you play the deuce at trick one, East knows that West has led from a four-card suit and West knows that partner's 4 is discouraging. For shame.^*N|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, you play 4-way transfer and your 2N is transfer to diamonds. So over 2@S if I bid 2N, showing a club honor (A, K, or Q) what were you bidding? 3@C or 3N?|

PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let"s discuss what to do over 2@D. In that case, if you think 3@C is forcing (which it should be since 2@S is still a transfer).|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You know you have a diamond stopper. I might not have a diamond stopper. So you should just bid 3N and help me out.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Transfer in the minors is overused by most people. There are only 2 reasons to transfer to a minor. You have a weak hand (fewer than 7 HCP) and a 6-card minor unbalanced (e.g. a singleton or void) and think 3 of a minor is better than 1N. |
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Remember 3 of a minor is 2 tricks more than 1N, so you should tread lightly when bidding it. For the same reasoning as you should prefer 3N to 5 of a minor.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Any contract which requires 2 more tricks than a good alternative contract is not usually a good alternative. Therefore, the only time with a weak hand to transfer to a minor is when you are unbalanced and weak.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other reason to transfer is when you have a 6 card minor with 2 of the top 3 honors and you play 4 way transfers. In that case, the transfer allows you to find out if partner has the missing honor.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if he or she does, then you know your hand will run 6 tricks in your minor suit, and therefore 3N is a good bet. The point I am trying to make is, it is very rare that a transfer to 3 of a minor is correct.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And finally Kia, at trick 3,should have ducked the @DK.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Someone suggested I bid 3H rather than 2@H. I have to admit, that did not occur to me but it is a good suggestion. Given I rebid 1N 12-14, I have close to a max—5 card suit, reasonable 3 card heart support. I am a little rich in queens, and Qx of spades is dubious. But 3@H would not be a bad bid.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play. Faye should try and ruff a spade before drawing trump. So she should either win the first spade and then play another spade, or duck the first spade. In any case, she needs to be careful. If she does not ruff a spade and guesses hearts wrong, she could lose 2 hearts and 2 spades.Whereas if she ruffs a spade, the contract should make most of the time.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You should draw trumps ASAP unless you have a good reason not to. And the most frequent good reason not to is when you need to ruff in dummy as on this hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This really is a good bid for me. Let me explain the 3 different levels of raising hearts. They are 2@H, 3@H, and 4@H.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@H would show a min opener 12-14.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


AT|

3@H would show a medium opener, 15-17 or 17-19 Bergen Points. It is NOT forcing. Some people think 3@H is forcing but it is merely invitational. My hand is huge, especially after 1 heart.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have 19 HCP, 1 length point, 1 quality suit point for 21 Bergen Starting Points. Add 2 points for the 2 doubletons once a heart fit is established—after 1@H by Kia.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Whenever you open 1 of a minor and partner bids one of a major and you have 20+, you must bid game. Often you just jump to 4@H which is my bid here. |
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I had a singleton, with a hand as is shown now,|md|1SK3AH47TKD2C79QKA,0,0,0|AT| I could splinter instead.|Ub||MB|1cp1hp|AT| For example if I had 3 spades and a singleton diamond, I should bid 4@D.|mb|4d|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let me take a moment to discuss the "8 ever 9 never" rule which is, when you are missing the trump queen, you finesse for it with an 8-card fit, play for the drop in a 9-card fit.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First of all, finesse doesn't always work. It just increases your odds. Secondly, the difference between playing for the drop and finessing is about 2%. |
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if you always finesse you would do just about as well as playing for the drop. And most importantly, the rule of playing for the drop is only correct "absent any other information."|

PG| ***** 87 ***** |


md|0,S8TH69QD45678JC8,,s974h3dqt9cjt642|AT| In fact, I would say it is wrong to play for the drop on at least half the hands. |
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is why. You often have information from the bidding. For example, say an opponent makes a 3-level preempt. That means you know 7 of their cards are in their suit. Therefore, the missing Queen is only 1 of 6 cards. |
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You also know how many cards in the preempt suit the partner of the preempter has. For example, say you and dummy both have doubletons—7 + 2 + 2 = 11 meaning their partner has 2 in that suit. So, you now know that in the preempter's hand, there are only 6 chances out of 13 that they have the Queen. |
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Whereas in the partner's hand, where you only know 2 of their cards, there are 11 chances out of 13 that one of the cards is the Queen. And therefore, you should finesse the partner of the preempter for the Queen. |
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The odds are much greater than 50% that it will work. The bottom line is this. If one opponent has shown a 5+ card suit, finesse the other opponent for the queen even with a 9-card fit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The points are approximately even between the 2 sides. So the fewer points I have, the more points partner has and partner is sitting behind the NT bidder, so his points are better placed. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I have most of our side's points, they are not well placed because all my finesses rate to lose. So counter intuitive as it sounds, you are better off balancing with a weak hand in this auction than a strong hand. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Often it is right to play passively but sometimes it is not. So on this hand we did better defending, but that assumes the defense plays correctly. Had I not corrected Kia, Faye would have made 1NT. That is one of the reasons you should strain to declare. It is a lot easier to declare than to defend.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because I threw away all my spades. Had you been counting spades (and I understand that is difficult) you could figure out that Faye started with 5 spades and had 3 left and therefore only had 1 diamond left. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not saying it is easy to do. To be a great defender you have to learn to count. But an expert would have figured it out. so I helped you out a little :).|

hondo717: ok kia, what was my double?
hondo717: sorry judy
nome: I have no clue H
hondo717: Kia switched seats on me :)
rattray:  lol
rattray:  was glad u asked him
hondo717: judy what do you think my double was?
rattray:  to
rattray:  thought the redbl took me out
hondo717: ok so over a redouble you are not required to bid
rattray:  thought so
rattray:  wrong
hondo717: but if you have a preference you should still show it
rattray:  with 1 pt
hondo717: and you do have a 5 card suit
rattray:  ok...
hondo717: it doesnt matter, if you dont bid I am going to have to bid
hondo717: so your bidding does not show anything extra, simply a preference
hondo717: pass by you means "I have no preference" but you certainly do have a preference on this hand
rattray:  yes a preference
hondo717: now let me get to Kia :)
nome: I am here
hondo717: do you have a diamond fit?
nome: yes at mot 9-card fit now
nome: but I have spades and hearts too
hondo717: well wouldnt it be nice if you told partner over 2D that you had a fit
hondo717: you even had 10 points (although the SKQ may not be worth 5)
nome: if she hand only 5 cards then my puny diamonds will notmhelpmuch
hondo717: so I would not hate a 2S cue bid as limit raise by you. although I prefer you have 4 card diamond support
hondo717: yes, but 3D is ok. you lack a diamond but you have a pretty nice hand
nome: okay
vybdt: do you think you can make game?  3nt?
nome: u mean 3D over 2H
hondo717: however, fortunately faye saved your partnership
shatha: yes
hondo717: I mean 3D over 2D actually
->vybdt: clubs are bad
rattray:  now if Faye had not bid, wld u have p
hondo717: "support with support"
nome: glp
hondo717: and certainly 3D over 2H after the redouble
nome: okay
cafaba:  typ
hondo717: good lead judy
rattray:  ty
->vybdt: now I see Fay has club stopper 
->vybdt: but hard to make 3N
hondo717: remember howard's 2nd most important rule of defense (1st is "2nd hand low smoothly")
hondo717: "it is never wrong to lead partner's suit"
hondo717: it may in fact turn out to be wrong on occasion, but it is usually right, and "you never lose the postmortem" if it is wrong
vybdt: you have the points in their suits - partner needs more than diamonds or has a longer suit - but again partner did not bid 3 diamonds so should have points in clubs
hondo717: not sure why faye played low
hondo717: but she now made more trouble for herself
hondo717: watch
vybdt: 6 diamonds - 1 spade - 2 clubs - if they play hearts you get one
hondo717: here is another good tip. in the middle of the hand, you should lead K from AK
->vybdt: yes but some of the table talks affeced my judgement. Judy said she had 1 point and I gathered they will go down in 2H
hondo717: now partner knows I have the HA
hondo717: if I led the HA partner would not necessarily know I had the K
hondo717: and now I just set up a diamond trick for our side, regardless of what faye did
->vybdt: that helps but I only can see two hand
hondo717: had she played the SK this problem would not have occurred
hondo717: the spade king is good faye
hondo717: or the club finesse is working
hondo717: if you played a diamond you would lose a cllub
hondo717: take the finesse
hondo717: ok, :)
hondo717: I see
hondo717: in case judy was being tricky
hondo717: ok think we gave Kia enough material for his movie.
hondo717: last hand
->hondo717: a kib said I could bid 3N
hondo717: the kib is wrong. it only makes because diamonds are very favorable
->hondo717: ty
->hondo717: they see the four hands
hondo717: experts call that "double dummy" analysis. and it is not a compliment :)


nome: Fay how come u do not overcall the suit I have cards and points in:):)
hondo717: faye ask Kia how come he never has your suits
DonnaS: you have to slip a signal card under the table
nome: I will be silent for the remainder of the session:)
hondo717: good bid judy
nome: please tell us what is the 2N?
hondo717: that says judy prefers 3H to 2N
hondo717: club stopper, 2 or fewer hearts
nome: k
hondo717: probaby only 5 spades
hondo717: looks like a misfit at this point
rattray:  lets c if this works
hondo717: it may not work, but you bid it correctly
rattray:  ok
nome: here we go again
nome: I play low
hondo717: you sure?
nome: no
Dixie_08: y
nome: fay played the 9 earlier
hondo717: trust your teacher :)
rattray:  lol
nome: can I call a friend?
rattray:  no olife lines left
hondo717: I guess Kia doesnt think I am his friend

hondo717: "2nd hand low smoothly" :)
