CP||AT|^c@2^Y@38. A good idea when playing Blackwood is to count the king of the agreed suit as an ace! This is called "RKCB" or "Five Ace Blackwood". When using this convention do not contract for slam unless you have at least four of the five "aces".

9. When responding to a takeout double, jump the bidding in your long suit with 9-11 '"revalued" points. An unbid five-card suit is worth 1 extra point and an unbid six-card suit is worth three extra points. Do not count points for jacks and queens in suits they have bid.

|HT|p|at|^c@2^Y@3You hold: @S AQ10x @H Kxx @D xx @C 10xxx
^dWest ^fNorth ^hEast ^jSouth (you)
^D1@D ^fDbl. ^hPass ^J?
Jump to 2@S. Do not bid 1@S which shows 0-8 points. Also, your jump is not forcing.

10. When responding to a takeout double with 12+ HCP, cuebid the opponent's suit to show a strong hand and then bid your suit(s) later. After you cuebid, any new suit bid by you is forcing.
You hold: @S KQxx @H AJxx @D Qxx @C xx
^dWest ^fNorth ^hEast ^jSouth (you)
^D1@C ^fDbl. ^HPass ^j?
Bid 2@C to show a big hand (12+HCP). You and partner then bid four-card suits up the line until you connect in a 4-4 major-suit fit. If partner bids 2@D, bid 2@H; if partner bids 2@S, raise to 4@S. The one who knows, goes.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The play was fine. But lets talk a little about the bidding.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Liz111:  I didn't expect to make it. It was a sacrifice bidding, as I felt you probably had 4@S. Should I have opened with a preempt?|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 3rd seat, Liz has a clear 4@H opener. Personally I would open that hand 4@H in all seats, but definitely in 3rd seat. |
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The only reason not to open 4@H is if you are worried about missing slam. Otherwise, you can be pretty sure that 4@H is going to be a good result if they let you play it there even doubled.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Liz111:  Same advice if we had been vul?|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Absolutely. it is unlikely partner has 0 tricks for you. I would say the odds favor your making 4@H more often than not.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if Liz opens 4@H, we miss our spade fit because Jenny probably bids 5@D (as she should).|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, it turns out we make 5 in either diamonds or spades. But there are many hands where, if we missed our spade fit, we can make 4@S but not 5 diamonds.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So 4@H makes it hard for the opponents to bid accurately. There is virtually no down side to opening 4@H.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now given Liz opens 1@H, 2@D is fine. 2@H is ok, but is a slight underbid by Don. Personally I would bid 3@C with Don's hand (remember that is forcing).|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But if you play a cue bid of 3@D (showing a limit raise) can be done with 3-card support, 3@D is another choice.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@S by me is fine as is 4@H by Liz. With only 7 pts, 2@H looked like the bid to me. And Jenny should use the "bid 4@S over 4@H" rule in a competitive hand and bid 4@S. Many experts call this the "automatic" 4@S bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I have 6 clubs then LOTT says it is the right bid. And if I have only 5 clubs but 3 or fewer diamonds they have an 8 card fit, so it is ok to bid 3 over 2—you have only 2 diamonds.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once I lead the @SK, Don should make the hand. The @SK shows the @SQ is in my hand, so if he takes the SA at trick 1, he has a 2nd spade stopper.|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|He can then count his tricks. He will get 5 diamond tricks, because all he needs is a 3-3 break or a 4-2 break with a doubleton @DQ or doubleton @D10. So 5 diamonds, 2 spades and 2 clubs = 9 tricks.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's talk about the 1N bid. It is ok although I would not open the hand 1N. Many people these days open off shape 1N bids. By "off shape" I mean the following:|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Strictly speaking, when you open 1N, you are only supposed to have 1 doubleton at most. So the only distributions you can have are 5-3-3-2 4-4-3-2 or 4-3-3-3.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But many people these days relax that restriction and open some 6-3-2-2 and even 5-4-2-2 hands 1NT if their long suit is a minor. They usually will not open those hands 1N if their 5 or 6 card suit is a major. So if you use the "relaxed" 1N rule, Don could open 1N.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But I don't like to open off shape hands 1N personally, because I think one of the nice things about 1N is that it is a very descriptive bid. Once you start violating the rules about when to open 1N, you lose the precision but many people disagree with me and that is fine. However, on this particular hand, although 1N is fine if you don't mind the 6-3-2-2 shape, Don might consider the following approach.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|He could open 1@D and rebid 3@D over the likely 1 of a major bid by his pard or he could decide to upgrade his hand to an 18 count because of his nice diamonds and rebid 2N over 1 of a major response. However, as I said 1N is fine as well.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|6@D is a great contract but, as with many minor suit slams, very hard to bid even if the @DK is offside it still makes 6. But let's talk about what Don might open. |
PG| ***** 100 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I understand why he likes his hand and feels like opening at the 1-level might be too weak for his hand. However, he has no perfect bid. Therefore, he should consider opening 1@D. If he does not want to do that and is considering opening 2@C, he has to think about how the auction will proceed after that.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If he opens 2@C I am just about always going to bid 2@D, and, as we saw, he has no good rebid. So 2@C is not the opening bid he should choose as he has no good rebid. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Absent opening 1@D his only other choice is an imperfect 2N opener which is problematic with singleton @SK. I personally choose 1@D, but I don't hate 2N.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Several people have suggested that Don open 1@C and reverse to 2@D over 1@S. The problem with that is that it misdescribes his distribution. Whenever you reverse, you are showing 5+ cards in our first suit, and a shorter 2nd suit (usually 4 cards).|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if the auction went 1@C-P-1@S-P-2@D (reverse) that would be showing a strong hand (16+) but it would also be showing 5+ clubs and shorter diamonds (almost always a 4-card suit). That is the problem with opening 1@C and reversing to 2 diamonds. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What he could do is open 1@D and jump shift to 3@C over a 1@S response.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since Don opened 2@C someone asked me about how I like to respond to 2@C and whether I use "step" response. I really dislike "step" responses. Let me explain how they work first.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over 2@C many people play "^*Bcontrol showing steps^*n" where an ace is considered 2 "^*Bcontrols^*n" and a king is considered 1 "^*Bcontrol^*n".|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|HCP showing steps are really a bad idea. As those who play Bergen hand evaluation know, HCP are only a small part of how you evaluate your hand. And knowing how many HCP responder has is usually not important to a 2@C opener, especially when they are opening it based on a long strong suit. Knowing how many aces and kings has some importance, so control showing steps have some merit.|
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Showing controls have some big disadvantages in particular. They often get the bidding up too high too fast and they wrong side the contract sometimes. So I think the automatic 2@D response is the best way to go. That way the 2@C opener can then describe why he opened 2@C and the auction can proceed from there at the lowest possible level.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people play 2@H shows a "bust" hand either no aces or kings or no more than 1 king and no aces. 2@H bust is ok, but that can also wrong side the contract. I prefer playing what is known as "3@C second nagtive". If it goes:|cs|6|

HT|l|at|^B{|ia|,2cp2dp2hp3c|at|}|ht|m|at|^mor|HT|l|at|^n{|ia|,2cp2dp2sp3c|at|}|
ht|q|at|^B@2The 3@C bid shows the bust hand. That is sometimes called "3@C - 2nd negative". That lets opener describe their hand and still lets responder show a bust hand over 2 of a major. Over a 2N rebid there is no reason to show a bust.

Generally, I try not to open 2@C and rebid 3@C or 3@D, but if I do then you just lose the ability for responder to show a bust hand.|

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
