^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Lots to discuss about the biddng and the play. First, as many kibs have pointed out, North has an opening bid if you use the rule of 20. My general rule, btw, with a six card suit is, you either open 1 or a weak 2, there is no gap. Now, let us accept the pass and discuss the auction as it went. The first two bids were fine. My 2@H bid was a reverse, and admittedly I was a bit weak for a reverse. But I liked my hand with all its controls, so I stretched a bit.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|After my 2@H, john knows we have game. A reverse is forcing to 2N at least, so even if john decides to bid only 2@S, I cannot pass. Then, john actually has 3 choices of bids, all of which have merit. One as I mentioned is 2@S. My personal preference is 3@S, to get across his solid spade suit. His other choice is 3@C, which is artificial, just 4sf to game. I am hesitant to bid 4@H, since it is a likely 7 card fit, and spades will often be a better contract, as on this hand.|

PG| ***** 33 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let us talk about the defense. dee is certainly right to want to lead clubs. However, as I have mentioned in the past, leading an unprotected ace against a suit is rarely right, and often wrong.  And in this case it did give up a trick.  My choice would have probably been a heart, as I am long in both of the opps side suits. The other issue on defense is lisa's ruffing of spades at trick nine. lisa should ruff the K of spades at trick eight.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is rarely wrong to ruff a winning trick by declarer, particularly if you are not sure it will be overruffed. And, conversely, lisa should not ruff the 2nd low spade. Because it is not usually right to ruff a loser, unless you are ruffing high to try and set up a trump trick for partner. So, to summarize the two rules about ruffing.  It is usually right to ruff declarer's winners, even if you think they might be overruffed. At worst you are trading tricks. And it is usually not right to ruff declarer's loser  unless you intend to ruff high, to force out a high trump from declarer, and set up a trump winner for partner.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, ruffing high to set up a trump trick for partner is known as a "trump promotion." To discuss a trump promotion slightly more, let me give you an example. Suppose they are in a 9 card fit, and you have Jx of trumps. If you ruff with the J, and partner started with Qx, you set up a trump trick  because if declarer overruffs with the A or K, partner's Q becomes good. If you ruff low, note that declarer can draw trumps in 2 rounds and not lose any trump tricks. So, that is an example of a trump promotion. Doesn't apply on this hand, but does come up quite a bit.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT|^B@2analisals: But how do you know pard has a high trump?|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


cp|8|at|
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You don't, but with Jx, it is unlikely you are giving up a trick by ruffing high anyway, so it is a no lose play.|

^-|cs||
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This was quite an interesting hand, for several reasons. First let us discuss lisa's one diamond opener. Many people advocate opening 1@D with 4 diamonds and 5 clubs and a minimum opening hand. The idea is that you can then rebid 2@C, which is not a reverse. If you open 1@C, you cannot bid 2@D as that is a reverse. However, I disagree with that style personally. As most of you know, I am a big believer in the law of total tricks, where knowing the combined number of cards you have in your suit is very important. So, if you open 1@D with lisa's hand, you never know whether lisa has 5 diamonds and 4 clubs, or 4 diamonds and 5 clubs. Thus, the problem for dee in whether to pass or bid 5@D.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people say that if lisa bids 2@C, that should show six, but I am not one of those people. I think it is ok to rebid clubs with 5 clubs. For example, if you are 2-4-2-5, and you open 1@C and partner bids 1@S, you  have to bid 2@C with your 5 card club suit (assuming you are not strong enough to reverse.) Therefore, I don't see any difference between a hand with 4 hearts and 5 clubs and a hand with 4 diamonds and 5 clubs. But, as I said, that is just my opinion. many people would open lisa's hand 1@D. To repeat, I do feel it is important to get your distribution across as accurately as possible. Now, as to the play.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First let me discuss my play to the first two tricks. I can see that we have 2 tricks for sure, a club and a heart and the whole hand is going to come down to the spade suit. So, I tried to make it as easy as possible for partner to not misdefend by accident. If I let partner win the first heart, he may lead a spade and blow up the hand  because a spade is a good return at trick 2, given the auction.  So, I overtook, and played the clubs to make sure that lisa had to figure out the spades herself.  On the other hand, continuing hearts gives lisa a ruff and sluff, so she also makes the hand that way, since she sluffs her losing spade from her hand.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to how lisa should play the spades. In this situation,  most experts would get the spade suit right. Let me explain why. After playing diamonds, clubs, and spades, lisa knows that South had 6 Hearts (from the preempt), 2 clubs, and 3 diamonds. Therefore, south started with 2 spades. South then started with 2-6-3-2 and I should have four Soades and it is twice as likely I have the @SQ. Then, percentage wise, lisa should play me for the Q. Counting out defender's hands seems hard to less experienced players, but if you practice for a while, it becomes easier as time goes on. I have a tutorial on counting out the hand on my web site. ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/CountingDistribution.txt^*N  It is really a good skill to develop, and not as hard as many people think.|

nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Hold the bidding, we need to reset this auction a bit. First of all, you two are playing 2 over 1, such that 1N is forcing. Then the bids through 2@D are fine. Unless you play drury, you should play 1N forcing even by a passed hand. And john's hand is a good example why. Now, john, why did you bid 3@C. in 2 over 1, that just shows a weak hand with good clubs, and is to play. You really have a limit raise with 3 card support in spades. Therefore, your bid after 2@D is 3@S. Otherwise lisa is supposed to pass 3@C, as that is to play.  Anyway, with a fit in spades, nothing wrong with playing in spades.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |

^B@2manawa: Thought of NMF.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|I see. But, NMF only applies if opener rebids 1N such as in 1@D-1@H-1N-2@C, where 2@C  is NMF. Please ask for undo. You have a classic 3 card limit raise, so you bid a forcing 1N followed by 3@S to show that hand. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|OK, we already discussed the auction. Let me discuss the defense. Because I had cards in diamonds, and lisa bid diamonds, I decided to lead a trump. I am sure  dee was not that happy about it, because of her trump holding. However, once partner chooses a defense, it is usually a good idea to stick with it, unless it is obviously wrong. Once I lead a spade (and even if I don't), lisa is going to figure out the spades. So, dee, you have to hope I have diamond tricks, and just continue with the Q of spades. lisa can't misguess it in any case. And it takes a trump off dummy, so lisa can't ruff diamonds. We should beat the hand, by taking 1 Spade, 2 diamonds, and a heart. But you gave up one heart trick.|

PG| ***** 87 ***** |


cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|What dee meant was she was trying to keep as many hearts as dummy, so that dummys hearts would not be good. However, lisa did bid diamonds, and there are no dummy entries, so you need to keep diamonds instead. Granted, lisa could be 5-3-3-2. However, in that case, your K of hearts was finessable, once you played the heart, so you might as well throw hearts. In case lisa started with 2 hearts and 4 diamonds. after all she did bid diamonds.  The point here is that you have to listen to the auction. In the actual auction, lisa did not bid 3@H, once we fixed it.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the opening club lead, pam should signal encouragement. Typically, if you want to encourage, you play your 2nd highest. If you always do 2nd highest, often partner can work out the suit. There was one more issue.  I know I always say 2nd hand low, and 99% of the time that is right. Well, be that as it may, I need to make a suggestion for ally regarding 2nd hand low. At trick five when Ira leads a diamond, you can see the setting tricks ally. You already have 3 tricks, and you have the ace of hearts  and the ace of diamonds. One of my rules is "it is never wrong to take the setting trick."|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand we need to discuss the auction. In general, I prefer to show a 5 card major rather than making a takeout double. I think 2@S is a better bid than double, otherwise it is hard to get across that you have 5 spades. Sometimes with 5/4 in the majors, you can make a takeout double, but even there, if you always overcall your 5 card major, it will work out correctly more often than not. Then, ally's 2N bid was natural. Assuming pam had understood ally's bid, then she has a pass.|

hondo717: |cp||at|ally was right to assume pam was doing "double and correct." If she had a good hand and wanted pam to pick a suit, she can bid 3@D. Cue bids are very flexible. It is also game forcing. The good play of note was ira's duck of the first spade at trick 5. That way, he guarantees himself 2 spade tricks. It was another good example of 2nd hand low.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, our auction was fine, just the contract turned out to be hopeless. Let us briefly discuss the 4th suit forcing by ira. He bid it first of all to establish a game forcing auction, while keeping the bidding lower. He was hoping I would show 3 card heart support, but I didn't. Once that doesn't happen, he cant really bid 2@H, because that would show a six card suit. So 2NT is probably best, because 3@D would be a diamond slam try. Now the other point is the play of the clubs. At trick two when pam gets in after winning with @DA, she should lead back remaining count, not the 7, either the six or the 4 to show she has more than a doubleton remaining. |
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not doing so, at trick four if pam believes that ally started with 4 clubs she needs to duck the 9 of clubs, otherwise the suit blocks, as it did. Let me explain further. If you recall ally led the 3 and then she led the 9 back. So she must have started with Kxxx. That shows ira started with 2 clubs. Therefore, because pam is the one with 5 clubs, it is up to her to make sure the suit does not block, and they take the 4 club tricks to which they are entitled. ally  would play the K on the 2nd club trick then lead either the 8 or nine. pam ducks and wins the last club from ally with her @CQ and wins the last club. Now back to "remaining count."|
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^g@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When you lead back a suit that partner has led, you lead back "remaining count." Let us say for example, partner leads a club and you have the combination on the left and you play the king on the first trick. When you get in and want to lead the suit back, you play the "remaining count." Here, you play the nine from the remaining doubleton.  |HT|c|cs|2|at|^B {|ih|pCK95|at|}|

^g@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you started with a combination as on the left, after winning with the king, you have 3 cards left. So you would lead the 3 to show that you had more than a doubleton left, 3 or more.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Actually, that was a hard hand to defend. not sure I would have beat it in real life. The only item of interest in this hand is the pass by ally.  It is rarely right to pass a takeout double at the one level, and this hand is no exception. You should never pass because you have nothing to bid. ally has a couple of choices;
- she could bid 1N, although ostensibly that shows 8-10;
- she could also bid 1@S since, although she has only 3, they are very good spades. That would have been my choice.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I had several questions about pam's 1N bid. Since we are playing weak NT, the way she shows a strong NT hand is to open 1 of a minor and rebid 1N.  So her 1N bid, unlike with strong NT, shows 15-17. Next, ira's 2@D bid just says he prefers 2@D to 1N.|
PG| ***** 186 ***** |


AT|  dee_dee_20: Why is Ira's 2@d to play?  |
PG| ***** 187 ***** |


cp|8|at| 
hondo717: |cp||at|Because pam has defined her hand. ira has other bids that are forcing. But, repeating his suit (2@H) or going back to pam's suit (2@D) are simply preferences to play instead of 1N.  ira already knows pam can have 17, and he chose to bid 2@D anyway. With 8 points, I dont agree with his bid, but the point is, he made it, so pam has no choice but to pass.|
PG| ***** 188 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would have chosen 2@C with ira's hand, which is checkback stayman, to see if pam had 3@H. And I am willing to play 2N, despite the singleton spade. I won't say that is the "best" bid, but it is the one I would have chosen. 

The other issue is, should ally bid 1@S. Most experts would bid 1@S with her hand. It is always good tactics to lay claim to the spade suit when you can, as to outbid you, the opps have to go one level higher. |

^C@2nome: As added emphasis on Howard's teaching I have decided each week to collect many of his important @E@3instructions in one page under "Howard's Pearls"  which we can go over them many times. The following are my picks. I am sure you can find many more.

|FP|2|cp|8|at|
^C@2** |FP||cp||at|It is usually right to ruff declarer's winners, even if you think they might be overruffed. At worst you are trading tricks. And it is usually not right to ruff declarer's loser  unless you intend to ruff high, to force out a high trump from declarer, and set up a trump winner for partner.

|FP|2|cp|8|at|
** |FP||cp||at|In "Trump Promotion", if they are in a 9 card fit, and you have Jx of trumps. If you ruff with the J, and partner started with Qx, you set up a trump trick  because if declarer overruffs with the A or K, partner's Q becomes good. If you ruff low, note that declarer can draw trumps in 2 rounds and not lose any trump tricks. 
|FP|2|cp|8|at| 
** |FP||cp||at|Once partner chooses a defense, it is usually a good idea to stick with it, unless it is obviously wrong.

^C @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.  

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N|
