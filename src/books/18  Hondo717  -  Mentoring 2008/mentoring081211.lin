 ^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| OK, I will start with the minor issues first before discussing various options for bidding this hand and responding to kibber's question. First of all, kia wanted to double my 1@S bid. He is a smidgen light,  as he should have opening points, and he is one point shy. However, because he has no wasted spade points, and has good distribution, a light double here would be reasonable.  dave does not play Bergen raises, so 3@S was fine as a limit raise. One could make a case that he has a strong enough hand to bid 4@S or even bid Jacoby 2NT as QJ of spades are good given I bid spades. And the Q of clubs paired with the K, makes his points actually quite good. |
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
 ^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next, let me address Drury as I am not a big fan of Drury. I prefer still playing forcing NT, so I don't need Drury. I can therefore have 2@C and 2@D be natural. However, if we played Drury, depending on which Drury, dave would bid 2@C or 2@D over my bid, and I would probably bid 3@S. |

panim: But, you opened 3rd spot.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|marion brings up an interesting point about 3rd hand openings. Let me give you some historical perspective. My style is to open all rule of 20 hands in all seats, and not open light. The reason being, if you open light, then pard will not know how high to compete. Again, that is just the style I prefer. Others may prefer opening light.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But let me explain why light openings in 3rd and 4th seat were originally invented. In the 50s thru early 80s, most experts preferred a style of bidding where openers in first and second seat were strong. They would usually not open with less than a good 14 or so. Therefore, it was necessary for 3rd and 4th to open light, because otherwise game could be missed. I used to love that style, because I always liked to play light openers, and in my younger days, I would preempt the heck out of the pros and leave them shaking their heads. |
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, since then, everyone figured out that aggressive bidding pays off and everyone opens lighter these days. Thus, the need for opening light in 3rd and 4th seat is no longer necessary, as you will not miss game if neither partner nor you have an opening hand. My feeling is you should only open rule of 20 hands in all seats. That way partner can count on you for certain values. Otherwise your hand is too undefined. That is just my opinion. Other experts disagree.|

EddyHaskel: What would be the correct bid for my hand if I played Bergen Raises? |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|With your limit raise hand if you play straight Bergen, your bid would be 3@D. If you play reverse Bergen (my preference) your bid would be 3@C.|

ELIZA42: what's the benefit of Bergen Raises?|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


AT|
@D@Dnome: I have gathered Howard's Bergen Raises teaching combined with another good source ^*Hwww.bridgehands.com/B/Bergen_Raise.htm^*N in a separate section. However, to underline a very important point, I am repeating the following exchange between Howard and dee_dee_20.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT|^B@2
dee_dee_20: Point range for weak please  1M - 3M?  Some play it very weak. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|There are 2 ways to play 1@H-3@H or 1@S-3@S. One way is that it shows 5 or 6, so partner can still bid game with a very good hand. The other way to play it is that it shows 0 to a bad 5. Partner should never voluntarily bid game, because if you can make game, opener has to have a strong 2@C opener. Which way you play it is up to you. I think more people play the 5-6 style. If you play 5-6 weak then you pass with four and 4 card support. A 2 level raise shows 5-9 with exactly 3 card support.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think the bidding needs some review. Everything fine up to 2@S. Now, we have to discuss the 3@C bid. By an unpassed hand, 3@C is definitely forcing. shows a 2 suited hand, forcing to game, and possible slam interest. However by a passed hand, you need some agreement. One could argue that it should be invitational and kia can pass with 3@C and 2@S and a weak hand in which case, jana's bid was fine. kia made life too complicated. He should just bid 4@S once jana bids 3@C. He has a max and 3 card spades support. So just bid game. Slam is not possible, since jana is a passed hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us first look at the play.  kia should suspect there is a good chance that someone has a singleton club. So, his best play is to win the club, play a spade to the Q, and cash the AKQ of hearts, pitching a diamond. At worst he is just pitching a losing diamond even if it gets trumped. And if hearts happen to be 3-3, then so much the better. It is possible that clubs are 2-2 and he can draw trumps and play hearts later. But the heart play is better odds. Here 7 makes. Now, as to the auction.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|jana's 3@D bid made it much more difficult for us to bid. once again showing why aggressive bidding pays off. kia might venture a 4@C bid over 3@S, and then we get to 5@C. I do not want to be in 6@C. Based on the auction, the more likely club distribution is for dave to have 3 and jana one, in which case we will lose a diamond and a club. So, even though six clubs happens to make, it is not a good contract based on the auction.|

nt||HT|D|cp|8|AT|^M@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Mostly we need to discuss the auction. kia's 1@S bid promises 5 spades. The reason being that with 4 cards in spades, kia makes a negative double. The two auctions on the left are specific cases. The top one promises only four spades and the bottom one shows five and its useful to know that kia has 5 spades.|CS|4|HT|c|AT|^B{|ia|,1c1hd|at|}|HT|s|AT|^B{|ia|,1c1h1s|at|} |
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


nt||CS||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|kia is a bit weak, but I like his 1@S bid because of the 5 card suit. If he only had 4 spades and 5 points, I would recommend pass rather than a negative double. Now, given that I know he has at least 5 spades, why didn't I raise.  Because I had a balanced hand and wanted to protect my AQ of hearts, I chose to bid 2N. I would not fault someone for bidding 4@S with my hand. Unfortunately for me, because kia only has 5 points, he passes. It is true that my 2NT after a minor opening promises 18-19 HCPs and I generally like to stretch and bid 3N over jump to 2N, even with six points, but pass by kia is reasonable. |
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people feel that kia is too weak to even bid 1@S. That is a reasonable argument, but modern bidding says we should lay claim to the spade suit if we can. However, pass would be fine as well. I would prefer kia's J of hearts be somewhere else. so on balance I guess I have a preference for pass. But 1@S is certainly within the realm of modern bidding.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am going to teach you an interesting convention I play with my wife ava. It is called the "sandwich NT."  If the opponents have bid 2 suits, and I bid 1N, it shows the other 2 suits (4-4 at least) and less than an opening hand. My 1N next means I have clubs and diamonds and less than an opener.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason I asked is that, normally, you should let partner know about your major suit fit ASAP. The one exception is when you have 3 card support and an invitational hand. In that case, you have to bid a new suit and then jump. If paul had not had, say, the Q of diamonds, then 2@H is a better bid than 1@S. You should prefer to raise if at all possible. Also, note des's excellent 3@C bid. Even though she knows we have few points, she also knows we have a 10 card fit. In fact, if her hand was slightly less balanced, say a singleton spade, she should sacrifice in 5@C. As it is, we go down only 3, for -500 against their 650. So let us play.|

kenne: How did you know to bid clubs?|
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Good question.  I didn't know to bid clubs exactly, but I had reasons.  My first choice would have been to bid spades. But since I didn't have spades, I picked the lower of my 2 suits, to give room for des to bid 4@D in case she had a double and correct in diamonds. She happened to have clubs, but if she had diamonds, we end up in 4 diamonds.  des's double is absolutely forcing.|
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I only pass if I have lots of hearts and think it better to penalize them. It is still a takeout double and I can only pass with really good defense. Now, let us discuss higher level doubles, and how they work. Up through 3@S, doubles are still pretty much takeout. So responder is expected to bid unless he has pretty good defense.  At the 4 level, doubles are "cooperative" which means, responder has the option of passing. He still should have good defense, but the double does not demand that he bid a suit. It asks responder to use their best judgement, hence the word "cooperative." So best you play with a partner who has good judgement :)|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First the play. Although she ended up making six, des could have planned the hand a bit better. She probably wants to make sure she ruffs a club and also, she might be able to set up the jack of spades. So, she should delay drawing trumps. Her best play at trick 2 is probably to play a spade. if paul has the Q (likely), she will get to pitch a losing diamond on the spade. And, she should also play clubs before drawing trumps to make sure she can ruff her low club. She was fortunate that the person with the ace of clubs had only 2 trumps, because if paul had 3 trumps, could take the last trump off the board.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Again, comes down to planning the hand at trick one. Also, at trick 6 you saw, ally should not play the Q of diamonds on the first diamond play. Her reasoning was, it was dropping anyway on the AK and that is true, if des figures out to play the AK. However, in actual fact, des will take the diamond finesse, and ally will score her queen more often than not. This illustrates one of my cardinal principles of defense, which many players, advanced included, have some trouble following for some reason.|

Here is a brief explanation of Bergen Raises by Howard.
^-
^B@2Bergen Raises are used by responder after partner opens one of a major and responder has 4 cards in the opener's @E@3suit. Reverse Bergen, which I recommend, works as follows. Responder must have exactly 4 card support. 
With 5-6 points, responder jumps to 3 of the major, 
with 7 to a bad 9 responder bids 3 diamonds (known as a "constructive raise"), 
with a good 9 to 11 responder bids 3 clubs (known as a "limit raise"), 
and with 12 or more responder bids 2N (the usual Jacoby 2N raise played by many partnerships.)

One of the important advantages of Bergen Raises is the preemptive jump raise (with 5-6 points). Modern competitive bidding theory says it is safe to compete to the 3 level with a 9 card fit, and Bergen Raises allow you to do this in a way that preempts the opponents.

If the intervening opponent bids, Bergen Raises no longer apply. I suggest you play the following methods over interference. If the opponent bids a suit, 
a cue bid shows a limit raise (9-11) with 4 card support. 
A jump raise shows less than a limit raise (5-8) with 4 card support. 
Over a takeout double, 2N shows a limit raise or better with 4 card support (this convention is known as Jordan 2N). And a jump raise still shows less than a limit raise (5-8) with 4 card support.

Some people play regular Bergen rather than Reverse Bergen. The idea is basically the same, only the meaning of the 3 club and 3 diamond bids are reverse, 3 clubs showing 7 to a bad 9 and 3 diamonds showing a good 9 to 11. The reason I prefer Reverse Bergen is that you want to explore for game more often over a limit raise than a constructive raise, and Reverse Bergen gives your partnership more room to explore. However, if your partner insists on playing regular Bergen, most of the value of Bergen Raises still applies.

And finally, yes, I still play Bergen by a passed hand. I cannot think of any good reason why Bergen would be off with a passed hand.|

There are more on Bergen Raises from Bridgehands web site at ^*Hwww.bridgehands.com/B/Bergen_Raise.htm^*N @E@3or you can read Bergen's book "Better Bidding with Bergen" Vol one page 37. However, your Bergen Raises skill would not be complete until you read Bergen's new book, "Better Slam Bidding with Bergen" which you can order from Howard's web site at ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/^*N. 

You may say, as i did initially, "I bid slam once every 4th. of July so why should I spend my  money on a book on slam boidding?" However, I considered it a bargain after what I learned from reading just three short chapters in the "Companion Workbook" which comes with the main book. The chapters were on hand evaluation, Splinters and Jacoby 2NT. 

What you will read next is an attempt to give you most common Bergen Raise treatments in a table. I used the table from Bridgehands as a template and made the upgrading using Bergen's book and Howard's teaching on the topic. The table contains the common treatments in Bergen Raises. The treatment for rare hands and situations which would be the topic of debates between experts are not included. A thorough discussion with your partner is a must before adopting all or part of Bergen Raises. 

The rows in red collor is further explained to meet Bergen's teaching on the topic in his new book.|

It can either show 5-6, and partner should raise to 4 with 18+. Or it shows 0-5, and partner must pass virtually all the time. The only possible exception being she/he is very distributional with long spades and a 5 or 6 card 2nd suit.  --  if she/he didn't open 2@C, then game is very unlikely.

^B@2Nome: Now let me explain why rows ##6 and 9 are in red. In my short bridge life I had many explanations for Jacoby 2NT and Splinter Bids. All experts, well almost all, agreed that you need at least 4-card support. The similarity stopped there. Some, taught no Jacoby 2NT with a void or a singleton. The point ranges were different. Some taught pure HCPs and some used dummy points. The Splinter Bids were not different. The problem became unbearable when it came to responding to both conventions and the rebids.|

Bergen's new book finally gave me logical definitions for both.  There are no reasons for me to memorize numbers and @E@3conditions which easily can be forgotten. Therefore, I am adopting Bergen's treatment of Jacoby 2NT and Splinter Bids. I am in good company because Howard plays both conventions the same way. Let me quote the explanation of the Jacoby 2NT and Splinter Bids from Bergen's book.|CS|4|at|

^-{          Jacoby 2NT by Marty Bergen          }
^-|at|
^b@2- Partner opens 1@H/1@s
- You are unpassed hand and the RHO passes
- You have 13+ "dummy points" with no upper limits. You could have fewer than 13 "HCP".  Please note the two |AT|
^B   differen yard stick of dummy points and HCP. 
- You have 4+ card support, you may have a strong side suit. And, with 17+ dummy points you bid 2NT even with a |AT|^B
   singleton. Therefore, with 13-16 dummy points and a singleton you bid splinter.|AT|

^-{          Splinter Bids by Marty Bergen          }
^-|AT|
^b@2Splinter Bids in Bergen's book is long and has sections for different skill levels. Here you will find the basics.
- Partner opens 1@H/1@S
- You have 4-card support
- You have a singleton (it could be an honor) or void. 
- You have 13-16 dummy points. Remember, with 17+ dummy points you bid Jacoby 2NT regardless even if you |AT|^B
   have a singleton.

^B@2As you note the explanations for both conventions and the rebids are simple and logical. I have to memorize only the 17+ and the rest are natural. For a comprehensive study of the topic and how to properly evaluate the hands please review "Better Slam Bidding with Bergen" by Marty Bergen. Further, I hope that they are part of Howards lessons in January 2009. Next, are quizzes on Bergen raises. You are sitting South, partner opens 1@H/!@S. Please note that there may be more than one good answer. It is easier to fly to the moon than find agreement between two bridge experts on a simple issue.|

^b@2The original hand from bridgeHands says, "Holding 6 HCP plus 1 distribution point for the Heart doubleton, first bid 1N (forcing) planning to rebid 2S on next bid.  Directly bidding 2@S would show 8-10 points - a constructive raise." However, let me quote Howard on this issue, "I really dislike the idea of 1@S-2@S or 1@H-2@H being a constructive raise with 3 card support; most modern players agree with me. So, if the auction goes 1@H/1@S-1N-2@C/2@D-2@S, that shows exactly 2 spades. If you have 5-9 with 3 card support, it is best to raise immediately, as it has both preemptive and informative value." I go with Howard --that is what he teaches. You may choose otherwise.|

From Dec 13
6) Board 5 - this is a game forcing hand (meets the rule of 20) with 2 card support. You bid 2C, and only raise spades if partner shows a sixth spade. Your comment about this being an invitational  hand with 2-3 card support does not match the hand. And, invitational hands with 3 card support (where you bid 1N followed by 3 of the major) are treated very differently than invitational hands with 2 card support (where you still bid 1N, but don't follow up by bidding 3 of the major).
