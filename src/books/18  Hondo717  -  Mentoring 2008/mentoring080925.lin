^D @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.  

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them.

^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| anne had a very hard hand to bid. It is rare you hold so many points after someone else opens, and also rare that you have such length in the opener's suit.  The hearts are worrisome, as they indicate a possible misfit.  But, anne can still double and correct to show her strength. |

nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Anyway, back to anne. the only way for her to show her strength is to "double and correct."  That means make a takeout double, and bid spades even if kia bids clubs or diamonds.  And because anne has so many points, she can jump in spades, which shows a 2@C opener.|

UP|24|PF|Y|nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Now, let us discuss the bidding.  First, if  you play unusual NT, I suggest you only do it with 5/5 or better, not with 5/4 as some people do. The reason for that is, it is an obstructive bid, and if partner can count on you for at least 5 cards in the suit, will know better when to sacrifice. Now, as for my bid.  Technically, because I have 5 clubs, I can safely bid 4 clubs.  And my K of diamonds is a great card as well.  My 3@C bid just says I prefer clubs to diamonds, but your hand keeps getting better the more kia bids, so 4@C was good bid.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| The reason I did not bid 4 clubs was more tactical than anything else. Usually aggie will be weak, and I don't want to push them into a makeable game.  Had they bid 4 of a major, I would have sacrificed in 5 clubs, but I was willing to let them play 3  of a major, on the theory that they can probably make game.  anne has a very bad hand  and passing is very reasonable.  But she has reason to be worried. She has both a heart fit and spade fit with kia. Had her ace of clubs been in a major suit, I think 4 hearts would have been a reasonable call.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| In real life, 4 hearts probably goes down 1, unless aggie is nice enough to tell kia that she has doubleton Q of spades :). And aggie is too competitive to do that!  But the point is, despite the even distribution of high card points, both sides can make 9 or 10 tricks.  That is the power of double fits.  I have played some hands where both sides can make slam. unusual, but it occurs.|

UP|40|PF|Y|nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
|cp|8|at|^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| This was an interesting hand, and a good example of competitive bidding judgement. On these types of hands, unfortunately, there are no hard and fast rules, but I will explain why I think everyone made good bids.  2 diamonds was fine. Some experts would argue moe has too much outside strength, but you know that I feel you should open a weak 2 any time you have a six card suit and 5-10 HCP. 4@S was fine as well, it puts me under a lot of pressure, and kia could easily be making 4@S  if aggie has the right hand. |
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
|cp|8|at|^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| Now, I have a problem.  It looks to me likely that they will make 4@S because I have so many diamonds. It is likely kia has at most one diamond, and maybe none. We have a 10 card fit, so that only leaves 3 for the opponents.  Now, by my competitive guidelines, since we have a 10 card fit, 4@D should be fine, but 5 may be a bit too high.  And this is one of the few instances where vulnerability must be taken into account. |
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
|cp|8|at|^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| A non-vul game is worth 420 (in spades) a vul game is worth 620.  Doubled undertricks non-vul are down 1=100, then 300 for down 2, 500 for down 3, and 800 for down 4. On the other hand,  doubled undertricks vulnerable are 200, 500, 800, 1100.  So what does that all mean?  It means if you are thinking about a sacrifice, at equal vulnerability you come out ahead if you go down 2, and slightly behind if down 3. Therefore,  you should consider a sacrifice bid at equal vulnerability if you are pretty sure you are down 2 or less, and not worry too much if you are down 3 -imps only.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
|cp|8|at|^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| If you are not vul, and the opponents are vul, then you can afford to be down 3.  However, if you are vul and the opponents are not, then you can only afford to be down 1. For those considerations, it was likely we were only down 1 or 2, and decided at equal vul to bid 5.  It is more judgement than anything else. You have to decide if you think the opps are making, and how much you will go down.  It might have worked out badly (for example, suppose moe did not have the ace of clubs.)  Also, by bidding 5@D I put pressure on aggie, and she might guess wrong|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
|cp|8|at|^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| BTW, just to not keep you in suspense, aggie, you make 5@S. You pitch a heart on the Ace of diamonds.  Actually, she wanted to bid 5@S, which turns out to make, but I told her not to. And here is my reasoning. When deciding whether to defend or declare, you have to look at where your points are located and whether or not they fit well with partner.  In this case, aggie has diamond points. since kia is likely to be void in diamonds, they don't fit well with kia. Granted, he might be able to throw away a loser, as he can, but they don't fit well. |
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
|cp|8|at|^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| In addition, aggie has a singleton spade, so if kia has the ace of spades, which is quite likely, she will get a ruff. So she can just about guarantee we will be down 2 in that case, ace of spades, spade ruff, and two red aces  and we might be down more.  So, if I had aggie's hand I would double.  As I said, it turns out 5@S is slightly better (by 120 points), but if she is down in 5 spades, then she turns a big gain into a loss.  On average, I think double by aggie is better. Again, these hands require judgement and experience, but I am trying to show you how experts analyze these hands when making their decisions.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
|cp|8|at|^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| Basically if you are short in partner's suit, and have points in the opponents suit, that tends to want to make you defend.  Conversely if you have points and/or length in partner's suit, you want to declare. |

|cp|8|at|^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| Well, very lucky that we made 5. We could have easily gone down in game, losing 2 clubs, 1D, and 1 heart.  However, let us discuss the bidding.  moe has an awkward hand to bid. He has a very good opener with 15 HCP, but not NT distribution.  15-17 point hands are awkward to rebid if you can't open 1N.  So, 1@H was fine, and then moe's 2 choices of rebids are 1N or 2@D.  He is not strong enough to bid 3@D or 2N and 1N is a slight underbid, but not much.  Now, kia's 2@C call is interesting.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT||cp|8|at|^B@2
|cp|8|at|^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| First, let us think about the implications.  Note that he did not open, nor bid 2@C over 1@H.  So how come he decided to bid 2@C on the 3rd round.  The conclusion aggie can draw is that his clubs were not good enough to overcall originally. However, despite that, because aggie has 4 card support, and kia has 5 clubs, 3@C by aggie is clear cut, again using my competitive guidelines.  Remember, if you have a 9 card fit, you should always compete to the 3 level.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT|^B@2
delcod1: How many pts & @cs does he need to overcall at the 2 level.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


at|
|cp|8|at|^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| He must have at least 5 clubs for sure and at least 10 points. Now, if he has a bad suit, as he did, he should not overcall, because he does not really want you to lead clubs. Here, he has the 10 points, but does not have good clubs, which is why he passed originally. But, once he does not hear us bid clubs, kia decided to bid 2@C the second time.  I am not sure I agree with him, it could be a risky bid, but it could work out, as it did. Nevertheless, once kia bids 2@C, aggie has a clear raise to 3@C|

|cp|8|at|^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| Well, this was a pretty straight forward hand for a change :). However, let me just go over Bergen Raises for those who are not totally familiar with it. Marty Bergen is a big believer in preempting the opponents when you have a good fit. Bergen felt that rather than making the auction 1@S-3@S or 1@H-3@H showing responder has a limit raise (4 card support and 9-11 pts), he wanted it to show a weak hand with 4 card support.  The idea being it was likely the opponents had a fit, and he wanted to make it difficult for them to find their fit.|

|cp|8|at|^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| You will note this is in line with my competitive guidelines, where I said it is ok to compete to the 3 level with a 9 card fit. Anyhow,  he decided 3@S should show a weak hand and as 3@C and 3@D as weak jump shifts were not that useful he decided to use them to show stronger hands with 4 card support. Originally, he said 3@C shows 4 card support with a good 6 to a bad 9, and 3@D shows a limit raise. However, most people have since reversed the meaning of those bids, as I did here, so 3@D is weaker than 3@C. |

|cp|8|at|^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| The reason I prefer what is known as "Reverse Bergen" is, it is more likely you want to explore for game when pard has the stronger hand and 3@C leaves more bidding room. I play Bergen even by a passed hand. Several kibs asked me that question. I see no reason not to still play Bergen if you are a passed hand. |

|cp|8|at|^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| OK, a couple of comments here. First, and most important, moe has an opening hand by the rule of 20.  Because of his weak majors, one could make a case that moe could open 2@D, to make it hard for the opponents to find their major suit fit. But generally speaking, I recommend that, particularly in first and second seat, if your hand meets the rule of 20, you open at the one level, as you might miss a game. |

nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
|cp|8|at|^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| Well aggie, I think you know the answer :). It is a little more difficult over a weak 2, but aggie, with her excellent club suit, should seriously consider bidding 3@C.  The problem is, quite often kia will have a good hand, but nothing suitable to bid over 2@D.  So, once I pass, aggie should strain to balance  particularly if she is short in diamonds. This hand has an additional factor in favor of balancing. kia will not think aggie has too good a hand, since she passed originally.  So I think 3@C is best with aggie's hand. |

NT|^B@2 
|cp|8|at|^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| First, the auction, then the play.  Up through 3@C, everything was good. Now, although kia knows they have a nine card fit, and therefore by my competitive guidelines 3@H is allowed, the problem is he doesn't have enough points  and his points are in diamonds, which are not likely to fit well with aggie, given the auction. And the danger is aggie will think he has a better hand, and bid game, as she did.|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
|cp|8|at|^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| Particularly since kia knows she is short in diamonds, based on the auction. aggie made a good 4@H bid based on kia's raise. He was overly aggressive on that hand. it might work, but in this case it backfired.

As to the play.  The ace of spades, was a reasonable lead, given the auction and the diamond shift was fine. |
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


NT|^B@2
|cp|8|at|^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| Now, notice that I figured out the diamond suit right away. Based on the auction, moe has at least 5 diamonds, and since there are 7 between my hand and dummy, that means aggie has at most one.  The point about diamonds is, if you pay attention to the auction and look at dummy, you can often figure out what declarer has. So a club back is probably better. |
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


NT|^B@2
|cp|8|at|^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| Now the other point was aggie lost track of how many trumps were out, otherwise she would have trumped a spade.  She made what is a very common mistake, even among some better players.  When counting trumps, sometimes declarers forget to count a trump as being played when the defenders ruff a trick.  If you recall, aggie, I trumped the K of diamonds.  Therefore, since you played one round, and we had 4 between us, 3 were already out, so I only had one left. |
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


NT|^B@2
|cp|8|at|^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| Therefore, you could safely trump the 10 of spades, and did not need to draw the extra round of trump.|
PG| ***** 128 ***** |

PG| ***** 129 ***** |


AT|
|cp|8|at|^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| As I said, I wouldn't worry too much, as that is a common mistake. Just try to remember in the future to count ruffs by defenders when figuring out the trump suit.|

|cp|8|at|^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| This was a good illustration of competitive bidding principles.  First, aggie, do you play limit raises or Bergen. raises?|
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


AT|
delcod1: Reverse Bergen and I could have bid 3@s.|
PG| ***** 143 ***** |


AT|
|cp|8|at|^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| Well, in that case you have a constructive raise of 3@D. You are too strong for 3@S.  But let us take the auction as it went. If the auction goes 1x-p-2x-p-p, it is almost always right to balance in the pass out seat.|
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


NT|^B@2   
|cp|8|at|^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| Anyway, in that auction, you should almost always balance in the pass out seat.  The general rule is, if they have a fit, you have a fit, and you will rarely do well letting them play at the 2 level if they have found a fit.  So, if you have a 5 card suit, you can bid it. you can also make a takeout double.  Another possibility is what Marty Bergen calls the "OBAR 2N."  OBAR means "over opponents bid and raise", which is exactly what happened.|
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


NT|^B@2
|cp|8|at|^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| And in that case a bid of 2N, even by moe in direct seat, is a takeout double, with emphasis on the minors.  If you play that convention, you can be as little as 4-4 in the minors. The theory being if they have a fit so do you.  So partner should favor a 4 card minor over 4 hearts if he hears an OBAR 2N. In direct seat moe is not strong enough. Had he  been in pass out seat, even with 7 points, you should balance with 3@D. On this hand pass was absolutely correct. |

But with a mediocre diamond suit, either 1N or 2@D is acceptable.  As to the play, the only point here is that if you make an effort as defender, and watch the play and listen to the auction, you can count the hand out, as I did.  It is not magic, and is often not that hard, once you get the hang of it.|

^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| That was a good hand for discussing whether or not to compete over a sacrifice. First, at this vulnerability, they not, we are, lisa has an excellent 5@D bid. Nice going lisa.  Normally, the conventional wisdom is "the 5 level belongs to the opponents."  However, with a singleton diamond, and heart stoppers, it was clear we only had 2 red suit losers.  And since I have AK of spades, it is likely anna had club points.  But she might have some diamond points instead.  So, it was not clear whether or not to bid 5@S. |
PG| ***** 178 ***** |


nt|^B@2|cp|8|AT|
*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| At any other vulnerability, double is clear.  But at this vul, even if we set them 3, they come out ahead if we can make game.  So I decided to risk 5@S. However, again, a lot of it is judgement and some guess work.
If the K of clubs is offside, we are down 1.  As it turns out, they are down only 1 in 5 diamonds.  So, even if I was wrong, I only turned a small plus into a small minus. |
PG| ***** 179 ***** |


nt|^B@2|cp|8|AT|
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Now, as to what anna should bid over 1@S.   I like her 2@H bid, as she has a very powerful hand in support of spades.   However, some people would just bid 4@S, on the theory that it is unlikely we have slam, and we probably want to be in game.  If she chose to do that, and the opps sacrificed in 5@D, then she has to either double or bid 5@S, because from my perspective, I don't know she has a good hand.  So 2@H is more informative, but 4@S has some tactical advantages, as it might make it difficult for the opps to find their diamond sacrifice.|
PG| ***** 180 ***** |


nt|^B@2|cp|8|AT|
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| lisa is a bit weak for 2@D over 1@S, but with her good suit and singleton spade, it would be reasonable if aggressive.  Let me again clear the probable confusion over the advantage of anna bidding 4@S rather than 2@H.  Although 2@H is a good bid, it does give the opponents more room to find a sac, whereas 4@S makes it more difficult.  So the tradeoff is, the advantage of showing your strength with 2@H, vs. the advantage of making it harder for the opponents with 4@S.|

**  If  you play unusual NT, I suggest you only do it with 5/5 or better, not with 5/4 as some people do.

**  If you are short in partner's suit, and have points in the opponents suit, that tends to want to make you defend.  Conversely if you have points and/or length in partner's suit, you want to declare.  

**  Really, some of the complicated conventions we play, like RKCB, are much harder than counting out the hand.

  better results.

**   Remember, your honors do better when they capture the opponents honors.

**   If partner leads a suit in NT, and you have A10 or K10, and there is an honor on the board, as on this hand, it is correct to play the 10.

**   "keep parity with dummy"  means, when dummy has a long suit that is a potential source of tricks, you should try and keep the same length as dummy in that suit.

**   If you can try for overtricks without endangering the contract, you might as well go for it, as it can be worth a couple of imps
