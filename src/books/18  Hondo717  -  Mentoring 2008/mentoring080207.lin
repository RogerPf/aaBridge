^d @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of most boards, if not all, the viewer would be able to play the hand double dummy or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. You can begin when |cp|8|at|^*BDouble D PLAY^*N|CP||FP||at| is shown at the right lower corner of the chat box.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N|CP|8|AT| 

Please help me improve these movies by sending suggestions to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.|CP||FP||AT|

                                                Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

SB|EFive|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


mb|p|mb|5H|SB|SSo why did you only bid 5 hearts, deb can only have one at most.|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: terry based on your holding deb only can have zero or one. She already showed one key cards. Therefore if you were not interested in slam with your holding why did you bid 4NT?|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |

Pear: oh I see what you mean ... well I was goiing to pass originally. May I have three undos please.|

PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: let's discuss the auction first. The double was fine. My 3@D was just furthering the preempt, supposedly making it harder for deb to bid. Once she bids 4@H, terry, you know deb has an opening hand at least. BTW, another bid deb could make is 4@D, asking terry to choose his best major but 4@H is a fine bid. The reason 4@H shows an opening hand is deb has other choices, pass and 3@H. I am sure you realize she jumped terry? So what did you think that meant?|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


AT|
Pear: I thought it just showed a long suit.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: OK, let us assume that all deb has is something like AQxxxxx of hearts, six hearts must still have good plays. She has no diamond losers, no heart losers no club losers, so the only thing you have to worry about is spades. Now, let us talk about how you show voids with blackwood as deb already alluded to it but we asked her to undo. If you have an odd number of key cards and a void, you bid 6 of your void suit, assuming your void is below the key card suit. So in this case deb bids 6 diamonds, showing 1 or 3 key cards and a diamond void. If you have an even number of key cards you bid 5NT.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: so if deb bid 5N, she would have 2 or 4 key cards and an unspecified void. I am not suggesting you play that, just explaining how the experts show voids. many experts don't even play that system. With zero key cards, you forget about showing any voids because it is unlikely that pard wants to bid slam.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


AT|
nome: would u consider cue bidding by E as a slam try here as they could have slam in either @H or @S. |
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: no reason for terry to cue bid, he can almost just bid 6@H over 4@H. This hand also shows the value of preempts, as it makes it harder for the opponents.|

NT|
^B@2hondo717: The main point of this hand is to not be afraid to lead your best suit against NT. Some defenders might not want to lead a diamond, for fear of leading into the AQ in terry's hand. However, if I fail to lead a diamond, we lose what is known as a "tempo" on the hand, terry will be able to knock out the A of hearts and Q of clubs and make the hand. So although my diamond lead ostensibly gives up a trick, it ends up netting me extra diamond tricks. Don't be afraid to lead your suit, especially if it is strong.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


AT|
nome: could terry duck one round of @D?|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: yes terry should duck the 2nd diamond, in case you have the A of hearts kia, you will be out of diamonds. However,here doesn't matter.  |
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


AT|
xxx_cpt: Howard would you have played the @HA if Terry had led toward the @HKQ on the board?|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Once terry gives me the club, and I knock out his 2nd diamond stopper, I would play the A of hearts, as I can count 5 tricks for the defense. But terry could lead a low heart from hand towards the KQ which will give him an extra heart tricks if I have the Ace.|

^B@2hondo717: I think you have a clear pass, was just trying to have you reason it out. You have 5 points, deb has at most 17, and may even have only 2 hearts. Therefore, game is unlikely.|

AT|
Pear: I thought you had to have a 2NT hand to overcall 2NT.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: No, you need a 1N hand to overcall 2N over a weak 2. if you waited for a 2N hand, you would never overcall 2NT after a weak 2.|

^B@2hondo717: My 10 of diamonds is a discovery play by me. If kia has the Q, and he might have it, by playing the 10, I would force the A from deb's hand, and figure out kia had the Q. So it is important I play the 10 rather than the K to help me figure out the hand.|

^B@2hondo717: Let us discuss how to bid over a 1N overcall. Since pard has opened already, it is a different situation for me than if terry had simply opened 1N. Here is the general rules about bidding over a 1N overcall. If you have 8 points or more, you should consider doubling the 1N overcall, because it is likely it will go down, often a lot. If you have a long suit and a weak hand, then you can bid your suit. You can also raise partner. The basic idea is, unlike normal auctions, where new suit by responder is forcing, over a 1N overcall, a new suit by responder is weak at the 2 level. It is just competing.|

^B@2hondo717: K was the correct card kia. Remember, when playing 3rd hand high, always play the lowest card in an honor sequence. That lets pard know you have the higher card(s). If you play the A I don't know who has the K, but if you play the K and it wins, I know you have the Ace. in this case you are going to play AK so it didn't really matter, but good to develop the correct habits.|

hondo717: In this case, since I trumped twice, there were only 3@H left. So if they were split 2/1, terry makes all the trump tricks. Or if kia had all of the remaining 3, he could finesse kia for the Q as he did. Remembering to count opps ruffs when counting trumps is important, but hard to do.|

^d@e@2Whether aristocrat, lawyer, farmer, or shopkeeper fiftysix ordinary men achieved something extra- @E@3ordinary when the Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776. The British called the document treasonous and the signatories traitors  singing it was an act punishable by death. Some signers lost their home in the ensuing Revolutionary War. Others were left without their livelihood. All had put their lives on the line.

The Declaration wasnt just a blueprint for revolution; it helped to secure the future of the United States and became the mission statement for world democracy. Were all familiar with the famous signers of the Declaration. Here, as a weekly series we will tell you about some of the lesser-known, ordinary heroes who declared our nations future. This week we have two more. |cp|8|FP|2|at|

^-SOUTH CAROLINA 
^-|cp||at|
The True Believer  |CP|8|FP|2|at|	 
ARTHUR MIDDLETON (1742  1787)  |CP||FP||AT|
Though an aristocrat, Middleton was a strong supporter of the Revolution, to the point of advocating the tarring and feathering of loyalists. In 1778, he was offered the governorship of South Carolina but turned it dawn. During the Revolution, the British imprisoned him and much of his property was destroyed.
|FP|2|at|
The Youngest Patriot  |CP|8|FP|2|at|
EDWARD RUTLEDGE (1749 1800 |CP||FP||at|
At twenty six, Rutledge was the youngest signer of the Declaration. He fought in the Revolutionary War and was captured by the British. Later, he became a senator and a governor. Interestingly, Rutledge had argued against the Declaration, but signed it in the name of unity.

^B@2hondo717: First the bidding. With my hand,  I have reasonable choices over 1@H by East. I could double and @E@3correct to clubs over terry's suit. That shows solid clubs and at least 16. However, with my double heart stopper, i chose 1N, if terry can provide one trick for me, it should make, as I rate to take 6 clubs and 2 hearts. I mean 3N would make with one trick from terry.|

hondo717: As far as the opening lead goes if kia had not supported, then a low heart is correct. The rule is, if you have not supported pard, you should lead your count, as that is usually more important to pard.|
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


NT|
^B@2Since Kia did support deb, then the 10 of hearts is probably better. In this case it didnt matter. 
hondo717: Now, let me explain why deb's J of hearts is correct play. She knows that Kia would not lead away from the Ace of hearts. Therefore, the only issue is who has the Q. If she plays the K, and I win the A, she has learned nothing. But if she plays the J, and I win the A, she knows kia has the Q. And if I have AQ, as I did, the J does not hurt. so the J is a no lose play, and provides valuable nformation.|

^d@e@2Puppet Stayman is a special version of Stayman that allows the responder to a NT opener to discover if opener @E@3has either a 4 card major (just like regular Stayman) or a 5 card major, and also allows the contract to be played by the opener, who has the stronger hand. Sometimes, opener will open either 1N or 2N (or 2@C followed by 2N) with a 5 card major, and Puppet allows responder to find the 5-3 fit in addition to the 4-4 fit. Many experts play Puppet Stayman over 2N (and 2C followed by 2N), and some even play it over 1N. However, it is somewhat complicated, and I do not feel it is necessary for less experienced players to use it.

Puppet Stayman works as follows. For this discussion, assume the opening bid is 2N. With either a 3 card major or a 4 card major, responder bids 3@C (Puppet Stayman).

If opener has neither a 5 card major nor a 4 card major, he bids 3N (not 3@D, as in regular Stayman). Responder now knows there is no possibility of a major suit fit.

Opener bids any 5 card major over 3@C. Responder can then either bid 4 of that major with 3+ card support, or 3N without support.

Opener bids 3@D with one or two 4 card majors. Here is where it gets a little tricky. If responder has both 4 card majors, he bids 4@D over 3@D, and opener bids his major (or chooses his best major if he has both). If responder has only one card major, then responder bids the other major. So, if responder has hearts he bids 3S, and if responder has spades he bids 3@H. The reason for this is responder wants to let opener be declarer, so responder does not want to mention the potential trump suit first, otherwise responder would be declarer. So, if responder bids 3@S over 3@D (showing 4 hearts), opener would bid 4@H with 4 hearts and otherwise bid 3N. Similarly, if responder bids 3H over 3@D (showing 4 spades), opener would bid 4@S with 4 spades and otherwise bid 3N.

                                                         Please click   ^$40  box below at the bottom of the page.

^B@2hondo717: Pretty interesting auction. First of all, lost in all that was terry's 1@D overcall. I like light overcalls at the one level, but I think terry was a bit too weak. If terry had the same number of HCP, but AQJxx of diamonds, I would accept 1@D as an overcall. But, particularly vul, I think terry was a bit weak for his bid. Now the rest of the auction.|
PG| ***** 178 ***** |


NT|
^B@2There are some important "negative inferences" from deb's bidding. By that I mean, you can figure out what deb had by what she didnt bid as well as what she did bid. deb could have made a negative double. However, since she has an opening hand, and can show her spades with a second bid, I think 1@H was the correct bid. We already discussed why over 2N, her 3@S bid shows 5 hearts and 4 spades. The other thing it shows is a pretty strong hand, because with a weaker hand, even with 5/4, she most likely would have made a negative double. Missing the Q of hearts and a key card, I am not sure I would have bid 6 with her hand, but it certainly worked out ok.|

PG| ***** 215 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: You could just bid it, missing one ace since you had pretty good 5 card suit. But you have to be a little lucky. Now to the Gerber. I am not a big fan of either gerber or quantitative 4N. Let me start with quantitative 4N. if the auction goes, for example, 1N-P-4N, some people play that quantitative asking partner to bid 6 with a max 1N opener, a good 16 or 17. But the reason I dont like that is HCP alone rarely determine whether or not 6 makes. It is more important that you have long suits and a good fit.|
PG| ***** 216 ***** |


NT|
^B@2So I dont play quantitative 4N. Similarly, I only play Gerber in very limited situations. They are as follows:
If pard opens 1N and I bid 4@C;
If pard opens 2N (or 2C followed by 2N) and I bid 4@C;
or if pard rebids 1N or 2N after opening  I bid 4@C.  That's it. So, in this case, I would have played kia's 4@C as gerber. And 4N by kia, since I don't play quantitative 4N, would have been RKCB for diamonds.|
