^d @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of most boards, if not all, the viewer would be able to play the hand double dummy or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. You can begin when |cp|8|at|^*BDouble D PLAY^*N|CP||FP||at| is shown at the right lower corner of the chat box.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N|CP|8|AT| 

Please help me improve these movies by sending suggestions to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.|CP||FP||AT|

                                                Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

^B@2kia made a nice 3@S bid. Although he only has 14 HCP, his hand is actually worth a lot more. Now, let me briefly discuss what is known as "Losing Trick Count" for hand evaluation. We will return to this board after my explantoion.|

^-| 
cp||
fp||

^d@e@2In general, I don't care for LTC, but it sometimes helps with hands such as kia's.  In Losing Trick Count, you @E@3evaluate how many losers you have in your hand. For each 3 card suit or more, you can have up to 3 losers. If you have an A, K, or Q you subtract a loser.  so kia has "2 losers" in both the spade and diamond suits. With shorter suits, you can only have as many losers as you have cards in the suit. So with a doubleton without an A, a K or Q, you can have two losers. Here with the club suit Kia has "one loser."

With Kx or Ax you have one loser. With Qx or less you have 2 losers. With a singleton, you can have one loser unless it is a singleton ace. Thus, in the heart suit, kia has no losers. As you can have up to 3 losers in each suit, with a very bad hand, you have 12 losers. However, in general, an opening hand is around 7 losers or possibly 6, an intermediate hand (equivalent of 15-17 HCP approximately) is 5 or possibly 6 losers, and a strong hand is 4 losers. Since Kia has a 5 loser hand (2 spades, 2 diamonds, and a club) he can consider his hand the equivalent of 16 points or so and therefore he can jump.

In hands with one or two long suits, it is a good guideline for figuring out how strong your hand is. In this case, with 5 losers, kia can consider that he has an intermediate opener, so 3@S is a good bid.

The reason I don't like LTC in general, is that the two suits Qxx and Axx are considered the equivalent "two losers." But, they are not even close to being equivalent. Axx is way better than Qxx.  In standard HCP, Axx is twice as good as Qxx, and that is more accurate. Anyway, my point is use Losing Trick Count with caution, but it can be a good tool for highly distributional hands.

Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page to retrun to the hand. |

^B@2Another way Kia could have evaluated his hand, is the old standard Goren shortness points. A doubleton being worth 1, a singleton worth 2, and a void worth 3. Therefore, kia has a 17 point hand (14 HCP, plus one for doubleton club, 2 for singleton heart.) And allowing him to bid 3@S. |
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


AT|
analisals: But shortness points are not allowed unless there a fit is established. |
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: lisa brings up a good point. theoretically, you are not supposed to count suit shortness points until you have found a fit. In this hand, however, kia has a "fit" in his own hand, with such long spades, so it is ok to count. Further, a bid of 1NT shows at least one spade.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: I use short suit points when evaluating how strong my hand is, but adjust as the auction proceeds. You can use Goren short suit points when evaluating your hand. It is easier and probably just as good as Losing Trick Count for most hands. |
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


AT|
IraCT: Howard when u bid 1NT aren't u showing 2 winners and therefore kia could bid 4@S? |
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: No, ira, I can have a very bad hand, so 4@S is a bit of an overbid.  For example I would bid 1N without the A of diamonds, and then 4@S has no plays. |
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


AT|
JohnnyHiLo: Shouldn't a singleton ace be worth 3 since it will win and then be a void? |
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT|^B@2hondo717: To answer Johnny's question about a singleton A.  I count ace as 6, 4 for ace and 2 for singleton. However, let me talk about singleton and doubleton honors in general. 
For Qx I count 2 points, don't count the doubleton;
For Jx I count one, either the J or doubleton, but not both;
For singleton K, I count 3, don't count the singleton;
For singleton Q or J, I count 2 for the singleton but not the HCP;
So in general, for unprotected honors, I count either the HCP or the shortness, whichever is more.|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|

^B@2hondo717: I have one diamond loser, 2 heart or 3 hearts losers, 2 spade losers if I am lucky, and one club loser if I am lucky. In other words, I am in big trouble unless I get very lucky, so I will play for luck. The first thing to do is win the A of diamonds, and play a spade, since I have limited board entries. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


pc|D5|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT|
^B@2deb, if you decide to lead diamonds against a suit contract, from KQ holding you should definitely lead the K. Otherwise, you risk losing to both the A and J and not taking any tricks. For example, on this hand, if I had the J instead of terry and ducked, you would take no diamonds. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


AT|
Badmonster: But you said that your wife said that leading the k from kq often goes badly unless you have the ten. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Yes, my wife feels that K from Kq often works out badly. however, if she decides to lead the suit, she leads the K. In her case she might have chose a different lead. But had she chosen to lead a diamond, it would have been the K. |
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


AT|
Badmonster: Ask her what she would have lead please. |
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: ok, just asked her, and she said she would have either led the K of diamonds or a heart. |
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


AT|
IraCT: Leading low diamond   what does that show? |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: the low diamond should show a diamond honor, the K or Q probably.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT|
^B@2analisals: Referring to Ira's question how could leading a low diamond deny the spade Ace? |
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: I misunderstood Ira's question. a low diamond says nothing about the spade ace, as far as I can tell. Ira, why did you think it denied the spade ace? |
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


AT|
IraCT: yes if I led a low diamond says no KQ I would rather lead A@S if I had it.
hondo717: Leading unprotected aces is almost never a good lead, except against slams. I suggest you break yourself of that habit. Aces are meant to take Ks and Qs, and if you lead an unprotected ace, you usually give away a trick. Generally, you should only lead A from AK.  |

pg| ***** 36 ***** |


pc|SJ|pc|S4|pc|S2|pc|SQ|NT|
^B@2hondo717: The reason I played the spades the way I did is that, missing the A and Q I always finesse the Q. That caters to terry having the A or AQ. It only loses when deb has the Q and terry the A, which only occurs 25% of the time. In this case the 25% case happened, but over the long run, my play works more often than not. Please also note that later on I will unblock the K when terry plays the A. |

AT|
analisals: Please explain  how you arrive at 2 heart losers with A and Q in your hand? Thought you only used the first 3 honors ? |
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Ah, lisa good question. When I am talking "Losing Trick Count" for hand evaluation, my heart suit is "one loser." That only has to do with hand evaluation during the bidding. During the play, you have to evaluate how many losers you have in reality.  In this hand, terry had K10xx instead of K10x, I would lose two hearts. |
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT|
^B@2JohnnyHiLo: What would have been the harm in North bidding 2@s over 2@h since it drew a void and you may get luckier? |
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: in general, when pard preempts, if you have a void, pass as quickly as possible. The hand is probably a misfit, and with misfits you want to stop ASAP. Sure, it turns out we have a spade fit, but if deb has the Ace of spades, we can never get to my hand. In general, if pard preempts, you should play in his suit. So, kia's pass is very good. |

^B@2hondo717: Terry you should not make a takeout double, as you do not have clubs and kia has bid diamonds, the hand could easily be a misfit. Once I open and kia bids at the 2 level, you should really pass, as it is obvious we have the majority of the points, and you have one of our suits at least.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


AT| 
A takeout double promises support for all unbid suits, especially when the opps have bid 2 suits, so you must have both spades and clubs on this auction to make a takeout double. |

^B@2hondo717: kia made a nice 3@H bid. showing an invitational hand. If he had a game forcing hand, he would bid 4@H.  I have an easy pass, as I have a min opener. |
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


AT|
analisals: Sorry don't understand Kia's 2 diamond bid. |
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Another possibility is 1@S. However, in sayc, 2@D is reasonable bid, because then Kia can show an invitational hand with heart support, by bidding hearts at his next bid, as he did. |
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT|
^B@2renvik: Why not just 3@h ? |
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: The reason Kia cannot bid 3@H directly, assuming you play 3@H shows a limit raise, is he only has 3 card support. A limit raise promises 4 card support. I know some people do it with 3 card support, but I really recommend you only make a limit raise with 4 card support. A 9 card fit almost always plays a trick better than an 8 card fit, so if you make a limit raise with 3 card support, you will often get to games that go down.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT|
^B@2Badmonster: Totally disagree with 1@s bid. He knows you have a major suit fit and you don't need a spade fit because bidding spades doesn't give you information you need to place the contract. I think the 2 level bid followed by the heart raise shows his hand. A limit raise with three card support. |
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: I agree totally with deb's reasoning. That is why I think 2@D is a better bid.|

^d@e@2(AG-lit)


That little plastic tip on the end of a shoelace.|CP||FP||AT|

This word for the little thingie that helps the lace go through an eyelet was adapted from aguillette, @E@3an Old French word for "needle." These words derive from the Latin word for "needle," acus, the source of another sharp word in English, acute. 

"Then you stick the aglet through the eyelet -- and voila!"

^B@@hondo717: First the bidding.  I like kia's double. it is his best bid. His clubs are really not that great to overcall at the 3 level, and he is a bit strong to pass. deb, I might try 3N with your hand, as you have a max pass. 2N is ok, but conservative. |

hondo717: well, deb was a passed hand, and she is just one point short of opening, is what I meant. |
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: As to the play, prior to playing clubs, deb should play diamonds to establish diamond tricks while you still have entries to your hand. That way, you always take 5 clubs, 3 diamonds, and 2 aces for 10 tricks. Again, as usual, comes down to planning the hand at trick one. |

^B@2hondo717: Nicely done again terry. Had terry had a better hand, this deal would have shown one of the advantages of 2 over 1. Give terry say the K of diamonds, and it is easy for us to get to 6 clubs. terry bids 3@D or 3@H over 3@C, which says he has possible interest in slam. Since I have 16, I am also interested in slam. In sayc, 16 opposite 16 is hard to bid slam, but in 2 over 1 much easier. Unfortunately terry did not have 16, but if he had we might have got to 6@C, which is almost impossible in sayc.|

^B@2hondo717: You did the best you could. It was an interesting hand. It turns out deb and kia make 5 spades. Losing only one heart and one club. And if they are down one in 5 spades, then we make 5 diamonds. |
PG| ***** 178 ***** |


AT|
Badmonster: Should I have bid it? |
PG| ***** 179 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: I don't know. the void in diamonds is very powerful, and if kia has the right 5 points, Q of clubs and K of spades, you are only down 1. So I would probably bid it. But it is a matter of judgement, and these hands are very hard to judge. |
PG| ***** 180 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: One other comment. I would personally open kia's hand a weak 2 hearts, but that is a matter of style. As I have often said, I love opening weak 2s, with any kind of 6 card suit, and 5-10 points, even with an outside 4 card major. I think the rewards of doing so far out gain the risks, but that is just my style. most are more conservative than me. |

^B@2hondo717: Not sure why kia changed his bid from 3@H to 2@H. kia has an interesting tactical decision. Certainly 2@H is a reasonable bid. However, you can make a case for him to bid 3@H or even  4@H. Of course, he is really too strong to preempt, but, on the other hand, a 3@H bid by him gives the opponents lots of problems. So, from a purely bridge tactics perspective, I might choose to bid 3@H with kia's hand. |

^B@2hondo717: The play is interesting. I would have actually played the hand wrong. Normally with 4 trumps out missing the Q you should play for the drop. That is 1-2% better odds, all things being equal. However, once kia shows long hearts, a better percentage is to play deb for Qxx of diamonds, so I would have cashed the Ace first, and then finessed the 10. It does not happen to work out on this hand, but it is a better play in general. |
PG| ***** 198 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Basically, with a 9 card fit, if one opponent shows a 6 card or longer suit, the odds favor playing the other opponent for 3 cards in your suit. One other comment on the play.  terry has one heart loser, and no diamonds or spades loser, once he draws trump, therefore, the trick is to manage the clubs correctly, and give yourself the best odds for only losing 2 tricks. So he has to give himself the most chances to only lose 2 clubs in order to make the hand. |
PG| ***** 199 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: The most likely thing is for kia to have the A@C. However, if kia has the QJ and deb the A, he will also only lose 1 club, if he manages his entries correctly. He needs to be able to lead clubs from the board twice to maximize his chances. The first time he should lead low towards the 10, assuming kia plays a low club. kia won't on this hand, but he might. If kia plays the Q or J on the low club, then terry puts up the K, hoping either Kia also has one of the other two remaining honors. terry's best chance is to lead clubs twice from the board. So he has to manage his dummy entries accordingly. |
