^*Bhondo717:^*N Nicely played aggie. joyce plays limit raises, not Bergen, and her 3@S bid was very good. Although she technically only has 9 HCP, she has a powerful hand, with 4 card support and an excellent club suit. aggie has a borderline hand -13 HCP, and can count 1 for distribution.  The other good thing about aggie's hand is she has "prime" values. By that I mean, she has lots of aces and kings, and her Q is in the same suit as her K. And, all her points are working. |
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N The other issue is that you should stretch for game. you can go down twice in close games for every game you make, and still come out. Therefore, I think aggie should bid 4@S.  Someone asked me about "LTC", which stands for "Losing Trick Count" which is another method for evaluating hands. Without getting into too much detail, with LTC, you have potentially 3 losers in every suit, for a total of 12 possible losers. For every A, K, or Q in a suit you deduct one loser. |
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Using the losing trick count method, it also turns out aggie has a borderline 4 spade bid. aggie has 7 losers and pard  has 8 so byt LTC 3@S should be the contract.  Basically, the hand comes down to can you hold your spade losers to one trick? And, the answer is, for most distributions, east and west will have one spade loser, just the ace. After all is said, however, most experts stretch to bid game, so I think aggie should bid it.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N A few things to discuss. First, the bidding, Everyone knows I advocate aggressive preempting, but even I think my hand is too weak for a 3@D preempt. However, there are some experts who would open my hand 3D, particularly because we are not vul and they are. But, assuming I pass, and moe opens 1@H joyce has a problem over the 1H bid. the hand in fact might be a misfit, but she has a pretty good hand. |
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Some people might bid 1N with her hand, but I don't agree. there are 2 flaws. She only has 15 HCP, and she has a singleton diamond. So, I think pass is best. And aggie's 2@C balancing bid is fine. However, once aggie bids 2@C, joyce must now show she has a good hand. one could make a case that she should just bid 3N and  I think that is the best choice. |
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Her other choice is 2@H, which shows a limit raise or better in clubs and will allow aggie to bid 2N with a heart stopper.  The problem with joyce bidding 2@H is that she still probably will never find out if aggie has some diamond cards which is really all she needs to know. So, I think bidding 3N is best, because she can count 5 clubs, a heart and a spade for sure. And hopefully aggie will have another couple of tricks. obviously she has points outside of clubs. |
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Some kibs are asking why joyce didn't double over the 1@H bid. She cannot double, because that promises at least 3 card support for the unbid suits. Occasionally, you can lie and only have 2 card support for an unbid minor, although I prefer not to. So anyway, the point is, although joyce can pass the first time, once aggie balances, she must bid something stronger than a simple raise. |
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Now, as to the play. If aggie relies on the auction, she should be able to limit her heart losers to one trick.  moe opened 1@H, promising 5. since she and joyce have 7 together, I have at most one heart. Therefore, once she plays the Q of hearts and moe wins the ace, and I play the 4, moe is pretty much marked with the J of hearts. The particular play is not as important as the idea that you need to take as many clues as you can from the bidding. Many declarers ignore the bidding once play starts (and defenders too), but you should keep the bidding in mind throughout the play of the hand. |

^*Bhondo717:^*N This is a pretty interesting hand. |
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


AT|
ArLady: Isn't his trumps too weak for 4 opening? |
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717:^*N I was actually worried we could make six given my hand, but in this case, moe's preempt backfired a bit, as it took away our bidding room instead of theirs. That is not to say I disapprove of moe's bid, I like it, because from his perspective, the opponents could easily have a major suit game. |
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N But in this case, I had an incredible fit for him. however, more often than not, his bid will work out very well.  joyce has an interesting problem. I think she should pass as she did. However, one kib suggested she bid 5@D as Michaels. 5@D bid by joyce  indeed would be Michaels, showing at least 5/5 in the majors, but her hand should be stronger. Otherwise, it is likely her partner will get very excited and bid six with many hands. |
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N So, although joyce has great distribution for Michaels, especially her diamond void, I think she is too weak, as she is forcing the bid to the 5 level. She does lose 3 clubs and a heart at least, and possibly a spade (although not likely), but that is down 2 doubled. So I think pass worked out best on this hand, because at best if we let them play 5 of a major doubled, they will gain a few points, but they will lose them all back if they push us to six.|

UP|20|PF|Y|NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N wow, that was some hand. In fact it is pretty unbelievable to have so many unusual random hands in one session. Further, I would like to say there are scientific ways for bidding those hands, but I would be lying, grin. However, there are a couple of things joyce could have done, instead of opening 1@C, but 1@C could work out as well. Since she has 10 sure tricks in her hand, she could open 2@C she could even open 5@C.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N 5@C would normally just be a preempt, but one could make a case that, tactically, that is the bid most likely to work out best. It shuts the opponents out. Bidding at high levels on distributional hands is very hard. It requires judgement and experience. Here, one could make an argument for opening joyce's hand 1@C, 2@C, or 5@C. A 4NT as Blackwood really doesn't help, because the only ace joyce cares about is the spade ace. |
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N BTW, joyce, you played that hand very well. You avoided taking the diamond finesse until you had to  and as a result, made six, since the diamond finesse loses. So nice playing. |

PF|Y|NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N First of all, excellent defense. It is very hard to beat a one level contract. Normally, it is not a good idea to lead a suit bid by the opponents. Therefore, since anna led a club, it is probably a singleton and roberta can actually work that out. She can account for 12 clubs.  mary opened 1@C, so she has at least 3, there are 4 on the board and roberta has 5. As I often say, if you pay attention to the bidding, even during the play of the hand, it gives you important clues about how to declare and defend. |
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N mary did well to begin drawing trumps ASAP. And roberta did well to cash the K of clubs and then play her lowest club back for anna to ruff. Her low club was a "suit preference signal." It indicated that she wanted anna to return the lower of the remaining non-trump suits (in this case diamonds.) However, if roberta had played a higher club, it would say she wanted the higher suit back (spades in this hand.) |
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N mary did well to pitch a loser on the 4th club trick. However, she could consider pitching a diamond instead of a spade, as you might be able to trump one of the spade losers in dummy  and that is how you might make the hand because you will not lose a diamond then. |
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N As far as the bidding, normally it is not a good idea to let the opponents play at the one level. However, roberta has a real problem as to what to bid. I would probably bid 1N with her hand.  2@C is another possibility. It is interesting to consider what a double by roberta would mean. There is no universal agreement, but I would assume it shows spades and some clubs. The diamond and heart bids are natural, but the club bid may be short. |
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Unless you have a firm agreement with partner as to what the double means, I don't think double is a good idea. I think 1N is probably best. It is not clear if it makes or not, but it certainly has plays. Finally, it turns out spades is best for W/E, but difficult to get there. |

^*Bhondo717:^*N lots to discuss. After a takeout double, most experts  play the following:
1 level bids by responder are forcing, just as if there was no double. So, here,  1@S by north would have been forcing. However, 2 level bids are not forcing as 2@D by north just shows a weak hand with diamonds. To show a strong hand, north has two choices. A redouble shows 10 or more points. And, if you play Jordan 2N, 2N shows a limit raise or better in hearts, usually with 4 card support. It is important that you know what to do over takeout doubles, as they come up very frequently. |

PG| ***** 107 ***** |

^*Bhondo717:^*N To answer roberta, since she has heart support, the singleton certainly should count for her points. And, yes  a 2@H bid shows the same thing as without the double, and a 3@H bid shows less than a limit raise usually with 4 card support. However, mary should  consider bidding 4 hearts over my 2 heart bid.|
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Now. let us discuss how mary can make 4 hearts if she plans the hand out, 4 hearts is most likely going to make. She has no club losers if she ruffs 2 clubs, and 1 loser in the other 3 suits.  So, if she wins the ace of clubs, ruffs a club, leads a diamond to the ace, and ruffs another club, she will only lose 3 tricks. That is the best way to make 4. |
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N There is another interesting situation on this hand, known as the "law of restricted choice."  The law of restricted choice has to do when you are missing the Q and J in a suit.  In this case, when roberta drops the J of hearts on the first heart trick, it turns out that there is a 75% chance that anna has the Q of hearts.  So, had mary not needed the 2 small hearts in dummy to ruff clubs, she should lead a low heart and finesse the 10. |
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N It turns out, if you are missing the Q and J, and one of them appears on the first trick, it is 75% that the missing honor is with the other hand, in this case anna's hand,  I won't explain the math, but you have to trust me that you should always finesse. |

^*Bhondo717:^*N Well, it turned out 3N was a pretty good contract. However, I think the bidding was ok. mary certainly has a pass over 2N, as she has a minimum hand.  anna might consider bidding 3N rather than 2N with her hand. she has a nice diamond suit, which should be a good source of tricks. And she has an opening hand by the rule of 20. Usually, if you have a rule of 20 hand opposite an opener, game is a good bet. |
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N someone asked if roberta should overcall 1@S.  Some aggressive players might do that, but I think pass is better. If the J of clubs was the J of spades, then I would consider it more seriously. But even then, I like to have at least 8 points to do it. |

^*Bhondo717:^*N Let me discuss anna's first bid. There is some confusion as to when you should bid 1@D and when you should bypass diamonds. Some people always bypass diamonds and bid a 4 card major over 1@C. On the other hand, most experts play a slightly more complicated rule.  If they only intend to take one bid, that is they have a weak hand, no more than 9 or 10 points, then they bypass diamonds in favor of bidding their major. However, if they intend to take a second bid over opener's rebid, then they bid diamonds first. |
PG| ***** 146 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Several years ago, everyone bid "up the line", meaning they bid diamonds first no matter what and you can still play that way.  The reason bypassing diamonds became popular is there are many more preempts now, so if you don't mention your major with a weak hand, you may be preempted out of finding your fit. But, with a stronger hand, the advantages of describing your hand outweigh the risks of getting preempted. In this hand, anna is right on the border line of bidding 1@D or 1@H. |

^*Bhondo717:^*N On this hand I want to discuss defensive planning, which is what I did. Once I lead the ace of hearts and the Q appears, I am pretty sure anna has a singleton. So, I can count 2 heart tricks, a ruff, a club, and 2 diamonds perhaps. However, it is important that I do not set up hearts for diamond pitches before knocking out the ace of diamonds. That is why I gave a suit preference for diamonds and anna should actually lead back the J of diamonds to assure that the ace  would be knocked out.|

PF|Y|NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N A few things to discuss. First of all, when to double vs overcall. I almost always recommend you overcall a major if you have a 5 card suit. A double almost always shows exactly 4 cards in the unbid major.  aggie has a clear 1@S overcall in any case, since she only has 3 diamonds. But even with 4 diamonds, I think 1@S is a better bid. It allows me to compete more effectively with 3 card support.|
PG| ***** 214 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N If aggie had 4 Spades and 5 diamonds, it is not as clear what to do. If her diamonds are really good, probably 2@D is better. But if not, then double is ok, because it allows us to compete in spades if I have 4. The basic idea here is that it is better to compete in the majors if possible, as you can keep the level lower. If you have a minor and the opps have a major, you have to always bid one higher than the opps. So, you should gear your competing to the majors whenever possible.|
PG| ***** 215 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Now, as far as whether we should compete to 3@S. Normally, with a known 9 card fit, we should. However, because I had their clubs, I chose not to bid 3@S, and because aggie had hearts, she chose to not bid 3@S. And that turned out to be a very good decision on both our parts. Although you should generally use my rule of bidding to the 3 level with a 9 card fit, there are exceptions if you have values in the opponents suit.|
PG| ***** 216 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N The other issue is whether or not kia should bid 3@H. Because moe did not double my 2@H bid, there is some inference that he does not have 5 hearts. On the other hand, kia knows we have a 9 card fit, so it is likely they have a fit somewhere. The problem is kia doesn't know whether it is in clubs or hearts. with a stiff spade, he wants to bid. And since moe didn't raise 2@C to 3@C, there is some merit to his 3@H bid even though it didn't work on this hand. |

^*Bhondo717:^*N Here is the problem that kia needs to consider. It is likely, looking at six clubs in dummy, that I will be able to take 9 tricks once I get in. Therefore, kia has to hope that moe has the K of hearts and I have the Q. In general, given that kia has 4 hearts, there is no upside to his playing low. |

^*Bhondo717:^*N Now, let me discuss my first 1@D bid. There is some confusion as to when it is correct to bypass the diamond suit and when it is not correct. If you have a weak hand, worth only 1 bid, then it is usually right to bypass the diamond suit. However, on this hand, I am willing to bid 1@S over 1@H, so it is better that I bid 1@D, particularly since my diamonds are so much better than my spades.  The rule basically is with a weak hand (6 to a bad 9) you should bypass the diamond suit, but with more points you should not. |

^*Bhondo717:^*N moe has a tough line, given the bad trump break. When you get a bad trump break, you have to worry about "losing control of the hand", prematurely running out of trumps. So, what moe has to do is knock out the black aces before drawing trumps, so that he can ruff diamonds if necessary.

Now, let us discuss an alternative as to how aggie might bid which is a "double and correct." |

^*Bhondo717:^*N If she makes a takeout double, and then bid a new suit, that shows a good hand, 16+, and a good suit. Then, if I bid the expected 1@H, she can bid 2@D, showing a good suit and good hand. And if she gets lucky and I bid spades, she can jump in spades. So a double and correct would have worked out well. I then might raise her in diamonds, even with my 3 points because I know we have at least a 9 card fit, and aggie has a good hand. |

^C@2nome: As added emphasis on Howard's teaching I have decided each week to collect many of his @E@3important instructions in one page under "Howard's Pearls" which we can go over them many times. The following are my picks. I am sure you will find many more.|fp|2|at|  

** Many declarers ignore the bidding once play starts (and defenders too), but you should keep the bidding in mind throughout the play of the hand. 

** Normally it is not a good idea to let the opponents play at the one level.

** Bidding at high levels on distributional hands is very hard. It requires judgement and experience.

** Normally, it is not a good idea to lead the opponents suit.

** Visualizing the defense happens quite often. It is a good habit to get into, just like planning the declarer play at trick one. 

** In order to play good defense, it is important to keep track of the suits. It is hard, but important
