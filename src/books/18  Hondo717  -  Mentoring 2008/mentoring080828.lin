^D @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.  

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them.

NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N ok, let us discuss the  auction. The key point is  aggie's first bid. Even if you had 4 diamonds aggie, you should overcall 2@H. In general, you should favor overcalling a five card suit to making a takeout double, particularly if it is a major. If you make a takeout double, partner will never work out if you have a five card suit, and that makes it hard to figure out how high to compete.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Now, if you have a 4 card major and 5 card minor, double can be correct, since it is easier to compete with a major than a minor. However, you still should favor bidding your 5 card suit, unless it is not particularly strong.|

NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N ok, lets discuss first the bidding.  Over my 1@S, aggie should probably bid 1N, showing 8-10 and spade cards. In general, your instinct should be to bid rather than pass. Fortunately, as those of you know who watch my wife ava, she belongs to an aggressive family. So joyce made a nice 3@D bid  making it easy for aggie to bid 3N. As to the play. aggie did well to count her nine tricks. However, there was no reason not to take the diamond finesse, since she had clubs protected, and other diamonds to get back to the board. So, she should have made 4 or 5.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT|^B@2
ArLady: in NT is it better to lead Partner's suit rather than a suit of your own.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


AT| 
^*Bhondo717:^*N Yes, moe's lead was correct, or at least reasonable. My general rule is "you never lose the post mortem by leading partner's suit" because it is rarely wrong, and often right.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


AT|

@D@D@D Yes, the double dummy is on. Try it with Diamond finesse.

NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N First the bidding. It turns out we should be in 4 hearts, but that is just unfortunate. moe was correct to pass 3@D. This hand looks like a big misfit, and if I don't have good hearts, we are in big trouble.  And even so, we will have problems making 4 hearts, because we have to get rid of lots of losing spades in moe's hand. So, the general rule is, if you think there is a misfit, and moe should think that, keep the bidding as low as possible. |
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Next, it turns out it is possible to beat 3@D.  joyce should think about leading a trump back at trick 2, to get rid of club ruffs. Since aggie lead a low club, it is likely she has an honor, perhaps even the K. And it is unlikely I will be able to throw my clubs away, since joyce has enough trumps that I can"t run the hearts without her ruffing. Therefore, based on aggie's opening lead, and looking at dummy, joyce should seriously consider leading back a trump. low would be fine. The Q is fine also.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


AT|
jlco: could Joyce x'd the contract?|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


AT|  ^*Bhondo717:^*N There is no reason for joyce to double, we could easily make it, and her double gives me valuable information about the diamonds.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


NT|^B@2
analisals: After an opening of one diamond shouldn't North bid hearts first?
^*Bhondo717:^*N That is an interesting question that lisa brings up. Normally, with 5-5 in the majors, you bid spades first and then hearts twice. However, because moe only has six points, and can only take one bid, unless I make a forcing bid the second time (2@H would show a stronger hand over a 1N, 2@C, or 2@D bid by me), it  might make more sense for him to bid 1@H, as his hand is stronger in hearts, and it also gives me the opportunity to bid 1@S. That was a very good question lisa, and I think in this case, moe should go against the normal "proper" bid and bid 1@H.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N I am not sure I would have seen that either at the table, but it makes sense.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


AT|
dee_dee_20: So if Moe was stronger and could bid twice  then @s first?|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717:^*N Yes dee, exactly.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


AT|
moedraznin: I was thinking about it as if I take off 1 little spade and consider it as 4@s and 5@H.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717:^*N Well, that too, but even if your spades and hearts were reversed, on reflection, I think 1@H is a better bid. It  gives the auction more flexibility.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


AT|    jlco: That's the beauty of bridge - learn a "rule", ignore it sometimes :)|

NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Auction first. joyce does not really have a takeout double.  She has the points, but she is in trouble if partner bids clubs, and that is likely to happen.  When you make a takeout double, you are promising 4 cards in the unbid major (or at least 4-3 if both majors are not bid), and 3 card support at least in the other unbid suits.  So, if I pass and aggie bids 2@C, which is quite likely, joyce will have a big problem. If she bids another suit, that is a "double and correct", which shows a stronger hand.|
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Now, if she passes the first time, and moe and I end up bidding hearts and clubs, she can then make a takeout double, as clubs are no longer unbid.
 
As to the defense, joyce did not let moe fool her. However, since moe bid hearts, her best hope is that she has 2 spades and 2 diamond tricks, so after taking her 2 spades, she should lead the K of diamonds.  It turns out moe makes 4 anyway, but if had a doubleton diamond, it would be set.|

PF|y|NT|^B@2 
^*Bhondo717:^*N OK, first the auction.  I had a couple of questions as to why I did not bid Stayman, since I had 4 hearts.  I could have, but I find with 4-3-3-3 hands, particularly when I have honors in all suits, it is often easier to play 3N than 4 of the major. Granted mary could have a doubleton somewhere, and we will therefore sometimes score an extra trick by a ruff in her hand, but remember 3N is one less trick than 4@H.  So my style is to just bid 3N with 4-3-3-3 hands, even with a 4 card major. However, if you choose to always bid Stayman, that would be fine as well.|
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Now, as to the play of the hand. After the opening lead is won in dummy, mary can assume bev has the K of diamonds. Therefore she can plan the hand out to take 9 tricks.  3 diamonds, 3 clubs (at least), and at least 3 tricks in the majors (2 aces and one of the Qs or Js.)  The easiest way to get 3 tricks in diamonds is to lead low towards the Q, rather than leading the ten of diamonds off dummy.  The way mary played diamonds she only got 2 diamond tricks.|
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N So probably her best play is to play a low heart to the J thereby establishing 2 heart tricks for sure. If it wins, she can lead a low diamond towards the Q. if it loses, she can get to her hand with a heart next time, and play a diamond.  The more important point is to count your winners and losers at trick one, and plan a line of play. I cannot emphasize that enough. many less experienced players flounder a bit  before settling on a line of play.  But if you get in the habit of planning, you will be much more successful.|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


NT|^B@2

@D@D@D As you already know you can now play this hand ( and all other hands in this movie) double dummy. Try it as Howard instructed. Do it before you click the forward arrow. Good Luck.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N OK, I think we need discussion on the declarer play and defense here.  In a suit, leading K from KQxx is correct, as you are trying to establish a fast trick. anna  picked the correct suit but led the wrong card.  Your objective in a suit contract is to establish fast tricks for yourself, because your low cards are probably going to be trumped.  However, your objective in NT is to establish the low cards in your long suit.  If you decide to lead a suit with KQxx, and that is often a good lead, you should lead low.  You don't have to worry about losing a trick, because eventually you can score the K or the Q anyway, it will not be trumped.|
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
^*Bhondo717:^*N Now, the question is what card should bev play.  Given pard led the K, she likes her 10, so playing it is not likely to give away a trick, assuming pard really had KQJ.  However, she doesn't want pard to think she has a doubleton. So I would play the 5, hoping partner would read that as encouraging.  She might not, but that is the best I can do.  In general, you want to play attitude. if you think you can afford the 10 then the 10 is fine, but with A9 on the board, you are not sure. |
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Now let us continue.  anna then led the J of diamonds, implying J10. So, on the J of diamonds, bev should play the 6, to encourage.  She knows mary should have the AQ, but looks like the defense can then take 2 diamonds.  Playing the K is a wasted honor, as there is no need to. bev can figure out from the lead that mary probably has AQ.  Now, as to mary's play. once the K and 10 appear on the first trick, spades are a good source of tricks. But she has to keep track of the spots.|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N The only card missing is the Q. all her other cards are high.  She did well to establish spades, but then forgot to cash them. It is hard, but you need to keep track of all the suits. usually only down to the 10 at most, but sometimes lower spots are important.  If you can keep track of all spots in all suits down to the 10, you will do very well.

@D@D@D don't forget to play this hand double dummy and follow Howard's instructions. Do it before you click the forward arrow.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N Nicely played anna. In particular, you did well to play the K of diamonds at trick 1, preserving the A of diamonds as an entry to your hand.  anna did a nice job of  PLANNING at trick one. I am proud of her.  Now, let us discuss the auction. First,  my 2N is a little off shape.  With 1N openers, I recommend they always be on shape. that is 5-3-3-2, 4-4-3-2, or 4-3-3-3 (that is no more than one doubleton, no singletons or voids.)  However, I sometimes open 2N with a six card minor, if I feel it describes the hand better.|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N My hand is slightly too weak to "officially" open 2@C, although some people would, since it only has 4 losers.|
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


AT|
aspiring: Well you find 6@c that way.|
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717:^*N des is right, if I open 2@C and then rebid 3@C, it is possible we get to 6@C. At least we have a shot,  but it also could get us in trouble.  And I am not sure I can construct an auction that gets us to 6 clubs. |
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N However, say it goes 2@C, I play if anna bids 2@H that shows 5+ card suit with 2 of top 3 honors, so anna has to bid 2@D.  Then I would bid 3@C, anna would bid 3@H, I might then bid 3N.  anna would then have to decide to bid 4@C over 3N.  If she does,then since I have all suits controlled, I could bid 6@C. But if she passes, or bids 4@H, we don't get there.  So, I guess a possible auction is 2@C-2@D-3@C-3@H-4@C-6@C. However,  I am not sure many pairs would bid that. |
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N And, having said all that, in general, I think my opening 2N with my hand works out better most of the time. So, I will open 2N on occasion with 6-3-2-2 if my six card suit is a minor and the hand is otherwise suitable. it tends to work out well.  I will not open 2N however if my six card suit is a major.  Now let us look at the difference between bidding texas and bidding a 3 level transfer. There is a difference, but most people don't really understand that. Experts play that the sequence 2N-3@D-3@H-4@H is a mild slam try  because the auction 2N-4@D-4@H is available if responder simply wants to play game.|
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
^*Bhondo717:^*N Opener should think about 6 with 3 card support and lots of aces and kings for ther points.  Therefore, if anna had chosen that sequence, and I had the same hand, except a third heart, I have a clear 6@H bid over 4@H. Of course, on this hand, anna should simply bid texas, as her hand is not quite good enough to try for slam. BTW, the same principle applies if you open 1N. For example, if the auction goes 1N-2@D-2@H-4@H, that is also a mild slam try using the same reasoning.|

NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Here, mostly we need to discuss the auction, in terms of my competitive guidelines. The first two bids are fine. Now, bev has 3 card support, so in that sense 2@H is ok, since she knows they have an 8 card fit. However, although I advocate being aggressive, particularly when you can raise partner, you do have to have some standards, lol.  The reason I don't think bev should bid 2@H, since that promises 6 points, or at least a good 5, is because partner, with a good hand, could jump to game when she should not.  mary's question about a "free bid" is a good one.  Before the advent of modern bridge bidding, a 2@H bid by bev was known as a "free bid", meaning it showed extra values, since bev could pass and not worry about missing game. Because mary could always reopen.|
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N However, these days, a 2@H bid by bev shows the same thing whether or not there was an overcall or take/out double -5+-9 points with 3 card support. Further, in 2/1 there is no such concept as a "free bid" any more,  at least in terms of raises.  Anyway, I think bev should pass. But given she didn't, what should anna do? Based o my competitive guidelines  anna cannot be sure we have a nine card fit, so in that sense 3@D does not meet the guidelines.  However, she does know that the opponents have at least an eight card fit.  Another competitive guideline is that you shouldn't let the opponents play at the 2 level. so it is ok to raise with 3 card support to the 3 level as the first raise.|
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N In other words, if partner overcalls at the 2 level, you can bid at the 3 level with 3 card support.  One of my principles is, it is ok to raise from 2 to 3 with 3 card support, when partner's first bid was at the 2 level. Therefore,  anna should bid 3@D.  And to answer mary's question, she can bid 3@H over 3@D, assuming bev had 5+/9 points, because she knows they have a nine card fit. That give another reason why bev's bid was a bit aggressive because 3@H went down 2.  The proper  bidding sequence should probably be 1@H-2@D-P-3@D-P-P-P.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N OK, the bidding was generally good, but I do have one comment. In general, you are better off playing in the weak hand's long suit if possible, because the strong hand's high cards are good no matter what trumps are. So, here kia should prefer playing in diamonds as opposed to spades. there is a however though. Because we have hearts, and they are higher than diamonds, kia's bidding spades allows them to possibly compete in spades. |
PG| ***** 191 ***** |


AT|
delcod1: Then does Kia forego mentioning his @s at all.|
PG| ***** 192 ***** |


AT|   ^*Bhondo717:^*N Well, in general he should prefer diamonds unless he has better spades. However, on this hand, since he only has 2 diamonds, is ok to bid spades.|
PG| ***** 193 ***** |


SB|W|NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Let us now get to the play, because it is possible to make 3@S  although difficult.  kia actually played the hand quite well but made one big mistake towards the end. Since I ruffed once, and he had already drawn one round of trumps, there were only 2 trumps remaining when he led a diamond off the board at trick 10. He also knows that both aggie and I are out of diamonds at that point. So, if he ruffs the diamond high, instead of with the 5, he can draw our two trumps with his remaining high trump, and his small trump is then good.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N OK, the bidding was fine, just will review some of the basic ideas. The first two bids were normal. aggie must pass, as a 1N bid by her would show 8-10 and she only has 5.  2@S by moe is clear. My double is takeout. Just about guaranteeing 4 hearts, plus support for the minors. In general, if responder has passed, doubles up through the 3 level by opener are still takeout, as long as there are at least two unbid suits remaining.  kia should pass my double as he did, and aggie should be happy to bid 3@D. although she only has low cards in the suit, she has 5, and in competitive hands, length is more important than strength. And by my completive guidelines, since kia has a singleton diamond, 3@S is the correct bid. |
PG| ***** 211 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Probably his best line is to play a heart right away at trick 3, as he did. He should pitch the K of hearts on my ace, to keep communications with the board. He should win my spade, and try and ruff another club.  Even if aggie ruffs with the Q of spades, that is a natural trump loser anyway. If he does what I said, he can probably limit his losses to 2 spades a heart, a diamond, and a club, and go down 1. But, this is a very hard hand to play. |

**  In general, your instinct should be to bid rather than pass.

**  Your objective in a suit contract is to establish fast tricks for yourself, because your low cards are probably going to be trumped.

**  However, your objective in NT is to establish the low cards in your long suit.

**  One of my principles is, it is ok to raise from 2 to 3 with 3 card support, when partner's first bid was at the 2 level.

**  In general, if responder has passed, doubles up through the 3 level by opener are still takeout, as long as there are at least two unbid suits remaining.
