NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Well done kiri.  First, a few comments on the bidding.  If you play Bergen raises, kiri can bid 3@H. And since judy bid, even without Bergen raises, kiri could bid 3@H right away because 3@H is still weak over an overcall. It shows 4 card support and less than a limit raise. With a limit raise or better, kiri bids 2@S.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Now, I don't mind diane taking a bid. But 2@S is a bit problematical. It really should show 3@S. If you believe in my competitive bidding rules, then telling partner how many cards you have in support is very important. So, I think diane has just enough to bid 3@C. If pard retreats to spades, that is ok.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


AT|
ArLady: I thought I was too weak to bid at three level.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717:^*N Well, you are right on the border, but 2@S does promise 3 card support. And I consider that pretty important and rarely lie about it. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N I find that in competitive situations, knowing how many trumps are between the 2 hands is very important.  Now, as I mentioned, with my hand we could have game. However, once they bid spades, my hand got worse. So I decided to just make a try.  kiri rightly only bid 3@H over my 3@D bid, as she was a weak raise and nothing in diamonds to boot.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
^*Bhondo717:^*N As to the play, everything was fine, except I think judy should try and cash her clubs when she gets in with the Q of diamonds. Turns out it doesn't matter, but it could. However, there is no real reason to cash the ace of diamonds, as it is not going away.|

NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Good play by kiri. let me explain when to cover and when not to cover. You always cover the last honor on the board. So, in this case if QJ on the board, kiri would not cover the Q, but would cover the 2nd trick if the J was played. But with only the Q on the board, the K is the correct play. The reason for that is that with QJ on the board, I might have the 10. If kiri covered the Q, leaving the J on the board, then declarer could finesse my 10. But if she waits until the 2nd trick, then my 10 can't be finessed. |
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N However, in this case, kiri covers, hoping she can set up my 10. Now, here I know I can play the 10 of spades, because judy has to have the ace, based on trick one.|

PG| ***** 57 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717:^*N Yes, you needed to keep better track of your entries.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


AT|
joyable: I had to keep that queen there.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N OK, just a quick review of NT overcalls over a weak 2.  You should overcall 2N over a weak 2 with a normal strong NT and a stopper in the bid suit. It is a bit risky, particularly when you only have 15. But the upside is that it is very descriptive. So if you have a bad 15, you might make a takeout double, but with a good 15-18 balanced, overcalling 2N is best.  You cannot pass with that many points, because you are letting the opponents steal you blind if you do. When the opponents preempt, unfortunately it makes it more difficult for you, and you have to take some calculated risks.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Now my 3@S bid is technically correct.  The only issue is one of tactics. Do I want to push them into a game that might make, against making it harder for them to bid.  Well, diane has a problem over my 3@S bid.  But with her singleton spade and 5 card suit, I think she again took a good calculated risk by transferring to hearts. Now as to the play.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N There were 2 issues with the play.  First the heart suit.  In general, if you have Qxxxx opposite AJx, it is better to lead low towards the J.  The reason being, if you lead the Q, even if south has the K, you are playing 2 honors to knock out one of the opponents honors. Basically, there are only 2 ways you are going to not lose any heart tricks. The more common way is if kiri has Kx of hearts. The other is if I have exactly 109 doubleton.  In general, you will lose 3, but kiri having Kx is much more likely than me specifically having 109 exactly. |
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Additionally, if kiri happens to have the stiff K, the way you played it you could lose 2 hearts. Whereas if you lead low, you only lose on heart.  So in general, when you have a choice if finessing, it is better to lead low than lead an honor. The other issue in the play of course is keeping track of the entries.  Once you are on the board with the Q of diamonds, you can take the club finesse at that point. If it works, you make. If it doesn't you are down 1. Here, it happens to work and the contract is makable.|

NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N I think the bidding needs to be discussed on this hand.  Of all the choices that kiri has for an opening bid, 1@S, 2@S, 3@S, or 4@S, 2@S is my last choice.  There are two reasons.  One is kiri has too many spades (7 not 6) and second, her hand is too good. Also, she has a rule of 20 opener, with 7 spades and 10 cards in spades and diamonds. So, I would either open 1@S, or 4@S as a tactic. But 1@S is fine. Now, given the way the auction went, let us discuss what kiri should do. |
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Her partner could bid 4@S, using my competitive guidelines, since they have a 10 card fit, but given the vulnerability, I think 3@S is reasonable. However, once I bid 4@H, kiri's hand becomes huge.  Therefore, kiri, with her heart void, has a huge hand, and should bid 4@S. It turns out 4@S is only down 1. Having said that, I think judy should bid 5@H over 4@S, because of the same reason, her spade void.  We probably end up making 5@H, but by bidding 4@S kiri gives us a chance to go wrong. That is why aggressive bidding often works.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Sometimes theoretically your aggressive bid should get doubled and go down too many, but often you push the opponents too high, or they just let you off the hook anyway.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


AT|
analisals: Does it make any sense for North to cue bid spades instead of bidding hearts?|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717:^*N Interesting question about the cue bid, lisa. But in this case, best to just get your hearts in as early as possible.|

NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N The bidding is fine, although if diane is adventuresome, she could try 3N over 3@H. But kiri will just bid 4@H anyway. Next, let me discuss opening leads in partner's suit when you have not supported.  In general they are the same. Low from 3 to an honor, high-low from doubleton, etc. Further, it is my belief that it is more important in partner's suit that he knows count than whether or not you have an honor. So, from 3 small, only in partner's suit, and only when you have not supported, I think you should lead low.|
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N This hand is a good example.  Let us say kiri covered the 9 with the J  I win. If I know partner has a doubleton, I can safely play the A and another, knowing that kiri started with two clubs  and perhaps promote a trump trick for partner.  However, if I am not sure whether she has two or three, I cannot do that. Again, as I said, only in the case where pard has bid a suit, and I have not supported, I recommend low from 3 small.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N Good job. you had the right idea on the hand.  There is a theoretically slightly better way to play, but it only improves your chances slightly. After the first spade ruff, take the diamond hook right away. If you take the diamond hook right away, you have a little more flexibility. That is all. So, ruff the 2nd spade, take the diamond hook.  It loses, ruff the spade return. Then  play 3 rounds of clubs, ending in your hand (not the board.)  Normally that is not a good way to play the suit, but in this case it is fine. Because if clubs break 3-3, you still have the ace of diamonds to get back to the club.|
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N And if they do not break, you are then prepared to take the diamond finesse again.  You basically played it the same way, just in a slightly different order.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N Time to discuss the bidding.  Actually, one of the kibs suggested I had a better bid than 4@S. And I think he is right. I think I should consider bidding 2N, just to protect my king of diamonds.  It turns out we can make 3N if played from my side, since judy has both red aces. Because no matter what she leads, we have at least nine tricks, and probably many more. I can count six spades and 5 clubs, and a red king if she leads a red suit.  So, that was a very good observation by the kib, vydbt. Nice going.|
PG| ***** 141 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N When you have a king that is in front of the opponent's likely ace, as in this case, It is better if you are declarer if possible, because the opponents cannot safely lead the suit  without giving up a trick. As to whether diane should rebid her spades, it is optional. On the one hand, she only has 5.  On the other hand, they are very good, and she also has club cards that fit with mine.  So, on balance, I think 2@S is the correct bid. I think the problem was mine. I should have considered bidding NT to protect my K of diamonds.  Anyway, interesting last hand. |

^*Bhondo717:^*N First, the auction was fine.  The play was almost perfect. aggie made one small mistake which cost her the contract. The Q of diamonds was a very good play aggie. Once I cover with the K, you should play the ace. Then simply knock out the jack, and your diamonds are good. I am not sure why you chose to duck the diamond. But that position comes up pretty frequently. If you are missing the K and the J, but have something like Axx opposite Q109, then take two finesses. if one works, you only have one loser.  So you played the suit well, had you taken the ace. |
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N The important thing was aggie, you had the right idea. You take the finesses the same direction. Basically aggie's play works if I have at least one of the diamond honors, and no guessing is involved. Many less experienced players play the ace and low back towards their hand, but that involves a guess. this does not.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N As you see, despite the fact I had a great hand, and we had an 8 card fit, I could not make 2@S.  If moe had stretched and bid 2@S with his hand, we would have got even higher, and gone down more.  That is why it is important to be aggressive but disciplined. If you watch me play in the main club, you will note that both my wife and I almost always have the points and distribution we say we have with our bidding, and that helps a great deal if you can count on partner.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N the bidding actually involves a lot of interesting decisions, and I like the decisions that were made.  Over 2@S, when it is moe's turn to bid he has 2 choices.  One is what he did, bid 3@C, the other is double, hoping to find hearts. It turns out we do have hearts, but his 3@C bid is much better. There are a couple of reasons for this. First and foremost, he has a great suit, can play even opposite a void.  Secondly, he has an inference. I did not make a negative double, so either I do not have hearts, or if I do, I have a very weak hand.|
PG| ***** 196 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Now, as to kia's bidding. By my rules of competitive bidding, he can bid 3@S right away over 2S, since there is a known 9 card fit. In general, if partner makes a weak 2 (either opener or overcall), you should raise to 3 with 3 card support. The only issue for kia is he might be afraid of pushing us into game. However, by bidding 3@S he makes it hard for us to find our heart fit, if we have one.  So, I would bid 3@S right away with kia's hand.|
PG| ***** 197 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N As to the play. aggie should  ruff the club high, and hope that the J of spades was dropping. it is unlikely moe would lead the A from AJ of spades.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N Well, first of all kia signaled high low. And second, moe would probably have taken the 2nd trick with AK.  Now onto the hand.  The bidding was fine  and the lead was fine. Good signaling by kia  and good ducking by moe. However, once clubs don't break, moe should switch to spades. Save the K of clubs for an entry and play A of and Q of spades. That will give him 3 clubs, 3 spades, a diamond and a heart. Has to hope the heart finesse works. This makes the play of the hand a bit easier.|

^C@2nome: As added emphasis on Howard's teaching I have decided each week to collect many of his @E@3important instructions in one page under "Howard's Pearls" which we can go over them many times. The following are my picks. I am sure you will find many more.|fp|2|at| 

**  In competitive situations, knowing how many trumps are between the 2 hands is very important. 

**  If you have a strong NT hand over a weak two with stoppers, you should bid 2N.

**  You always cover the last honor on the board.

**  Aggressive bidding often works.

**  From 3 small, only in partner's suit, and only when you have not supported, I think you should lead low.

**  Letting the opps play at the one level will not get you a good result normally.
