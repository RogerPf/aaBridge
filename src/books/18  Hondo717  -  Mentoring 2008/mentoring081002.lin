^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Lots to discuss on this hand.  First, let us discuss aggie's options  because they are confusing. There are different rules on the specific auction 1@C-1@D. You should only make a negative double with at least 4-4 in the majors. Therefore, if you have only one 4 card major, you can bid it, just as if kia passed. If kia bids 1@H over 1@C (or 1@D), it is different because now you have "Negative Double" available to you. |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Negative Doubles are geared towards telling pard about your majors.  So if the auction goes 1@C/1@D - 1@H, there is only one major left -Spades, and the  rules are different. In this auction a 1@S bid shows 5+ spades  and a negative double shows exactly 4 spades. In a separate chapter kia has the rest of my discussion on "Negative Double" which you can review later.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| To answer the question on 1@D bid by kia, I actually think since kia has a weak 2 in diamonds, 2@D would be a better bid. Further,  when moe bid 1@S, kia should assume moe has 5 spades, and therefore with a 9 card fit, ok to bid 3@S.

@D@D As you may know, you can play this hand double dummy before clicking the forward arrow.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| Well, normally it is, but you have a very powerful hand, almost a 2@C opener.  Normally, we should be in 6@D. However, again, the weak 2 made our bidding harder.|

UP|13|PF|Y|nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| Basically aggie, if I have 2 aces, you can visualize that you should be in 6.  So over 3N, bid 4N (diamonds are trump, since last suit bid), and if I show 2 aces, and you bid 6@D. It is hard, but this hand is a good example where you cannot just simply count points. We also can make 6N if played from my side.  If played from your side, 6N goes down on a heart lead.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| 6@D is probably safest, if I have one diamond and 2 aces, it is probably cold, and even in the unlikely event I have no diamonds, it makes on a 3-3 break. I might have QJ of hearts for example, rather than the ace or K  so @6D is safest. In general,  on strong hands with long solid suits, you have to kind of realize they are much stronger than the HCP indicate, and picture hands I can have where you make game or slam.  On this hand, hopefully, now that I have explained it, you can see, that 6@D must be a very good contract if I have 2 aces.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| Theoretically, we could make 6@D with only 8 points in my hand (the right 8 points of course.)  And since I overcalled a weak 2, I must have at least 12 or so.  An overcall of a weak 2 promises an opening hand. On the other hand, evaluating hands with solid suits requires experience, so I wouldn't worry too much about missing slam. The main lesson here is that HCP are a guide, but are less accurate the more distributional the hands are.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| OK, the auction was pretty straight forward. But, let us talk about kia's plans for the hand. Potentially, kia has a loser in each suit which would be down 1. Now, if either the spade finesse works, or kia guesses the diamonds, the contract makes.  And, that in and of itself is 75%, as that is the odds of winning at least one of two finesses.  The reason for that is, winning one finesse is 50%.  So, either both finesses work, both finesses lose, finesse A works, or finesse B works.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| So there are 4 possibilities, and only one is bad, which is 25% of the possibilities.  However, having said that, kia can increase his odds because he should notice that he can set up a heart trick to pitch a diamond  and therefore will not have to take the diamond finesse.  If he plays a heart at trick 2, the contract is pretty much guaranteed, as he eliminates his potential diamond loser.  The lesson here is to try and improve your odds. 75% is good, but virtual certainty is even better :).|

UP|32|PF|Y|nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| Normally, bidding 3N with a singleton in the preempt suit is a bad idea. However, because moe has such a powerful hand, and a good source of tricks himself, 3N was a good bid in this case. As you can see, he didn't even need the Ace of diamonds as a trick, just as a stopper.  Although in this case, 3N was the proper bid by moe, but if he only had 15 points or less, and a singleton diamond, he should not bid 3N. The basic point I am trying to make is, if you have a singleton or void in your partner's suit that he preempted, don't try to rescue him, just let him play in his suit.|

UP|52|PF|Y|nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| OK, this was an interesting hand, particularly to bid. First let us discuss kia's bidding, which was quite good.  The 1@C was fine and  once I balance with 1@S, kia knows that even though he has a great hand, he has no help from pard. So, a 1N bid by kia, shows what he has at least 18 or so. He would have opened 1N with 15-17, and with moe having less than 6, 1N with less than 15 is very dangerous. Now back to our bidding. It is important, particularly in the majors, that you show what you have when you have support.|
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| With modern bidding, there are many variations of how to show support. aggie has 3 ways to show support:
with a limit raise, 2@C, as she did;
with 3 card support and less than a limit raise, she can bid 2@S;
and with 4 card support, she should usually bid 3@S, with less than a limit raise.
It is important that you show precisely what you have whenever possible. Now, with my hand, if we have no wasted heart points, it is possible we have game. So, I bid 2@D, because if aggie has diamond points, I want her to like her hand more.|
PG| ***** 96 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| 2@D makes her hand even better, which is why she must not bid 2@S, which is her weakest bid. After the 2@d bid she should either bid 3@S or 3@D, either is fine.  As you see, even though we don't have that many high card points, we still make game. The main reason is my void in hearts as Marty Bergen explains it, because neither of us have heart points, we are playing with a 30 point deck, more or less, so we need less to make game.|
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| Again, remember that HCP are only a guideline, you need to reevaluate your hand up or down, based on the auction. My bidding was designed to help aggie evaluate her hand. had I bid 2@H, she would have disliked her hand, and bid only 2@S. But once I bid 2@D, her hand gets much better. so, same number of HCP, but better in the context of the auction.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| Had we let them play in 1N, they probably make it. So by competing, aggie turned a minus into a plus. Rarely is it right for them to play at the one level, so if you are in pass out seat, you should compete if at all possible. As to the play. I think I always make 2. However, Kia does one trick better if he plays 3 rounds of hearts. He can see I am setting up a cross ruff, so he should take out my trumps.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| We  are most likely making 1N, so no harm in going down moe. However, let me have a quick review of DONT. A double shows a single suited hand; responder to doubler bids 2@C, and doubler passes with clubs, otherwise bids the suit. A suit bid shows that suit and a higher ranking suit. so clubs shows clubs and another suit, diamonds shows diamonds and a major, and hearts shows hearts and spades. Responder passes with 3 cards in the bid suit, otherwise bids the next suit up. Suit bidder passes if that suit is his suit, otherwise corrects to his suit. 2@S shows just spades, so depending on your point count you can either double and bid spades or just bid 2@s|
PG| ***** 143 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| As in this case, since kia had less than 3 diamonds, he bids hearts, the next suit up. If moe had hearts, he would have passed. In this case, he corrected to spades. Now, when do you bid DONT?  As everyone knows, I am fairly aggressive, so I have some pretty relaxed rules about bidding it.  With a good 5 card suit that I would have overcalled and 10+, I might very well double showing a single suited hand.  However, you need to be a bit cautious, so with a 5 card suit, you should probably have 2 of the top 3, or 3 of the top 5 honors . |
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| On the other hand, with any six card suit and as little as 9 points, I would. With a two suited hand, I use the following guidelines:
with 4/4, I like to have an opening; and
I prefer with 4/4 that most of my points are in my suits;
With 5/4, I like to have at least 11. If my suits are very good, I might relax that a little; with 5/5, I will bid it with as little as 8 or 9. Those are in direct direct seat. In balancing seat, I might relax those point counts by a point or 2, as moe did.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| OK, first the bidding.  As you all know, I am a big believer in weak twos, aggie has a pretty strong hand, and lots of her strength is outside hearts. And, although 2@H is certainly acceptable, I have a slight preference for 1 heart. With my hand, 4@H seems pretty clear cut, although I am worried that my K of clubs does not count for much, and I was right. And to clear a point I should say that the rule of 20 does not apply to overcalls aggie, only opening bids. You can overcall at the one level with as little as 8 or 9 points, and at the 2 level (not counting weak 2s), with as little as 10.|
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| As to the play, aggie nailed it. it just takes a little planning. She knows she has 2 clubs and a diamond loser for sure. she has to do something about her 3rd club loser. Ruffing it out is easiest, although she could knock out the ace of diamonds, and pitch it on the J as well.  However, she must take care of either ruffing it or knocking out the ace of diamonds before drawing trumps.  So, it really just comes down to planning at trick one, which, as you know, is always a good idea.|

^-{NEGATIVE DOUBLE}
^-
|cp||
fp||
at|
^C@2When partner opens one of a minor, responder's bidding is geared towards finding a major suit fit. When there is @E@3an intervening one level overcall, responses vary depending on what is overcalled.

Before I get into specific auctions, let me discuss the general principle behind negative doubles. Negative doubles are designed to uncover a major suit fit. Therefore, when making a negative double, responder should have at least 4 cards in the unbid major. If both majors are unbid, and opener can bid the majors at the one level, then responder should have 4 cards in both majors. So let us examine the 3 different auction types, depending on whether the overcall is 1@D, 1@H, or 1@S.

If the auction goes 1@C-1@D, responder's choices are as follows. With 4/4 in the majors (or possibly 5/4), responder should make a negative double. If responder only has one major, he should bid that major, even with only a 4 card suit. 1@C-1@D-1@H/1@S does not promise a 5 card major suit. In other words, other than the negative double, responder should make the same bid he would have absent the 1@D call.

If the auction goes 1@C/1@D-1@H, things are a bit more complicated. Since the negative double is now available, responder can take advantage of that fact. Therefore, a negative double promises exactly a 4 card spade suit. With 5 or more spades, responder bids spades. This allows your side to better judge how to compete.

If the auction goes 1@C/1@D-1@S, things are even more complicated. A 2@H bid by responder promises both a 5 card suit and 10+ points. Therefore, responder must make a negative double with 4 hearts, regardless of point count. And responder must also make a negative double with 5 hearts, if he is not strong enough to bid 2@H. That latter case also brings up another important bidding principle regarding negative doubles. If responder makes a negative double and later bids his major suit (sort of a "negative double and correct"), that shows a hand with a long suit that was not strong enough to bid the suit directly. For example, if the auction proceeds 1@C-1@S-x-P-1N-P-2@H, responder is showing 5+ hearts and less than 10 points.

@D@D nome: Next is the quiz. |

^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| lisa is a bit weak for 2@D over 1@S, but with her good suit and singleton spade, it would be reasonable if aggressive.  Let me again clear the probable confusion over the advantage of anna bidding 4@S rather than 2@H.  Although 2@H is a good bid, it does give the opponents more room to find a sac, whereas 4@S makes it more difficult.  So the tradeoff is, the advantage of showing your strength with 2@H, vs. the advantage of making it harder for the opponents with 4@S.|

**  If  you play unusual NT, I suggest you only do it with 5/5 or better, not with 5/4 as some people do.

**  If you are short in partner's suit, and have points in the opponents suit, that tends to want to make you defend.  Conversely if you have points and/or length in partner's suit, you want to declare.  

**  Really, some of the complicated conventions we play, like RKCB, are much harder than counting out the hand.

**  I see no reason not to still play Bergen if you are a passed hand.

  better results.

**   Remember, your honors do better when they capture the opponents honors.

**   If partner leads a suit in NT, and you have A10 or K10, and there is an honor on the board, as on this hand, it is correct to play the 10.

**   "keep parity with dummy"  means, when dummy has a long suit that is a potential source of tricks, you should try and keep the same length as dummy in that suit.

**   If you can try for overtricks without endangering the contract, you might as well go for it, as it can be worth a couple of imps
