^D @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.

^*Bhondo717:^*N Let us discuss the auction first. It is not clear if 3@C is forcing.   Since I have a rule of 20 opening hand, and a club fit with moe, I intended it to be forcing. In general, if partner opens and you have a rule of 20 opener, you should be in game especially if you have a fit. And since moe opened 1@C, I know we have a fit. The only exception is if you have a 2 suited  rule of 20 hand, and partner bids the other 2 suits and shows a min, you might worry about the misfit. |
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Misfits play particularly badly at 3N, because transportation between the 2 hands is difficult. That is why, btw, if partner shows a long suit, and you have a min hand and a singleton in that suit, you should not "pull" his long suit to NT. That is probably the worst thing you can do.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Now, let me discuss the defense a bit, in particular aggie's discarding. Your first discard aggie should probably be a high spade to let joyce know about spades. And, although it is not clear what to discard after that, you should be worried about discarding from Jxxx.  Often, that results in declarer being able to set up an extra trick in his suit, as in this case.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


AT|
delcod1: I was trying to protect those @ss. Figured Joyce had the @Hking and might get back to me. |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N I understand, which is why I said it wasn't clear. Just something to keep in mind. You made a reasonable choice.  You don't have to worry about joyce getting back to you. You have spade entries, so if you signal spades, she will lead one if she gets in. The only point I was making was, you should worry if you have to discard from Jxxx.  I probably would have done what you did on this hand.|

PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N With a 5 card major, you should always transfer aggie. Then based on your point count you either pass (less than 7 points, bid 2NT (8-9 points) or 3NT (10+ points) giving the opener a choice to play either in 3NT or 4@S. |

^*Bhondo717:^*N Now I am assuming joyce has 2 spades. Sometimes with 4-3-3-3 some people will play 3N rather than 4@S, and that is reasonable, but most of the time on this auction I can assume joyce has 2 spades which means I now know here original distribution was 2-3-5-3.|

NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N That was really excellent playing by joyce. she managed to end play both moe and I. Since she knew she had stoppers in all of the suits, there was no harm in her losing a couple of tricks, in the hopes that it would gain her an extra trick. And that is exactly what happened. she got an extra trick because she ducked a few tricks first. Having said that, since I signaled hearts, despite my previous comment about worrying about discarding from Jxxx, moe need not worry about it as much.  So, moe can afford to discard a heart and save a club.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N If he is able to lead a club back we hold it to three. That is why my signaling is important. BTW, my signaling a heart is just informative. I still want moe to lead clubs, I am just telling him my outside entry is in hearts.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |

moedraznin: I missed your first @H all I saw was the 6 but that was late.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717:^*N That is important to remember. you often want to lead back partner's first bid suit. if partner signals a different suit, that may just be information, not a demand to lead that suit.|

NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Hard hand moe. you did well to make 4 but we will discuss a slightly better approach in a minute. First, let me discuss joyce's opening lead. Many people think that you should lead an unbid major against NT so many would lead a heart.  However, I personally disagree with that.  I have found that, unless you have a very good reason not to, you should lead from your longest (most important) and strongest suit. So, here I would have led a club with joyce's hand. On this hand, it really doesn't matter. But, in general, I feel that leading from your best suit works out better in the long run. aggie assumed that joyce had something better than 10xxx in hearts, and kept letting moe take his heart tricks. |
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N So, if partner can count on you to have strength in the suit you lead, usually you are better off. Now, moe can make one slight adjustment to his play. although it was good. Because he has entry problems back to his hand, as well as to the board (remember what I said previously about misfits giving you entry problems in NT), he has to be a little careful to manage his entries. He should leave the six of diamonds in dummy, hoping that the 9 of diamonds will be an entry to his hand. Therefore, when he begins to play diamonds, he should start with an honor, probably the J or 10.|

NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N joyce again bid and played that hand like an expert. Well done. First, let us discuss the auction. moe's 2@H bid shows a limit raise. Technically, he just barely has the points for a limit raise. However, because joyce opened 1@H, he needs to discount his heart points. Therefore, I do not feel he really has a limit raise.  Remember, you need to keep re-evaluating your hand based on the auction and downgrade honors in the opponents suit. So when you have a marginal bid, be more conservative with those types of hands. |
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT|^B@2
moedraznin: so 3@s would have been right? |
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717:^*N Yes, I think 3@S would have been better on this hand.  Now, joyce made a great 4@C bid.  aggie should really consider bidding 5@C over 4@C because joyce must be at least 5/5 in clubs and hearts, and 4 card trump support is very good. Granted, aggie is not sure how useful her diamonds are, but since she knows joyce has a void in hearts (we have a 9 card fit and she has 4), it is likely they are useful.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N since I believe in stretching for game, I think aggie should bid 5 clubs thereby rewarding joyce for her excellent bidding, as well as her excellent play.|

NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N OK, I want to go over some bidding issues on this hand.  joyce's 2@D bid was very good. it gave me a big problem. I have enough point barely, to bid 2N, but my doubleton diamond is not a good enough stopper I felt. However, I really didn't like a takeout double either, since I don't have 4 cards in either majors. 3@C was another possibility, but my club suit was pretty bad. So, I picked the best of a bad set of choices, and doubled. And aggie should have bid 3@d. If your partner opens a weak 2, and you have 3 card support, you should always raise to 3 as long as you have at least 5 or 6 points.|
PG| ***** 96 ***** |


NT|^B@2
delcod1: I thought I should have 10 hcps.|
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717:^*N You have a known 9 card fit, so by my rules of competitive bidding, the 3 level is reasonable with a 9 card fit. The number of trumps is the key on competitive hands. If you have a 9 card fit, ok to bid at the 3 level. Given aggie passed, moe has a pretty good hand. He is short in diamonds, and has no wasted diamond points, some 10s to go with his other honors. So, 3@H should be his bid.|
PG| ***** 98 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Now after 2@H by moe and with 15 points, if I had another heart, I might bid 3@H anyway. But given that my K of diamonds is not likely to fit well with whatever cards moe has, and the fact that he did not jump, I chose to pass. However, had aggie bid 3@D, and moe bid 3@H, it makes it harder for me to bid further, because now moe may just be competing. That is why it is good to be aggressive on competitive hands, as it makes it harder for the opponents to exchange information.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N The first two bids were fine. Although I like aggressive overcalls, I think ally is a bit weak for a 1@S bid. Generally, even at the one level, you should have at least 8 points. After the overcall, I have 2 bids I can make. I know we have game, so I can bid 4H and that is an important concepts. I know some players might only bid 3@H or even 2@H with my hand, but, at the very least, once you know that you have game and what suit to play it  you should bid it. |
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N My other choice of bids would be 4@D. that is a splinter, showing a game force in hearts and diamond shortness. The reason I chose not to do it (although 4@D is very reasonable) is because once ally overcalls one spade, I decided it was unlikely my spades fit well with partner. Remember, as the auction proceeds, you need to keep reevaluating your hand based on what is bid. A kib brought up a good point. betty should actually pass my opening bid, as she only has 4 points. |
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Even if partner opens one of a minor, you should pass unless you have 6 or a good 5.  Don't worry about partner having a short minor. First of all, that rarely happens, probably around 85% of the time, the opener has at least 4 cards in the minor. And 2nd, if they do, it is likely the opps will balance, and if they do not, one of the minor is probably not all that bad a score. |
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Now, to the lead. Generally, leading the opponents suits (except sometimes trump) is a bad idea. If ally didn't want to lead a spade, she should probably lead a diamond. Rarely is the lead of the opponents suit a good lead. In fact, if my pard does it, I assume they have a singleton. So that is a good habit to break, along with never leading unprotected aces (except against slams.)|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Now as to the play. Once the 2nd club trick occurs, betty can count only 3 losers, assuming hearts break. One  club, one diamond, and one heart. Also, on ally's spade lead, betty should probably play the Q, since, based on the auction, it is very likely ally has the ace, and betty needs the tricks.  So, on the spade betty should probably play the Q, and then play the Q of diamonds. Even if the person who wins gives their partner a club ruff, it is quite possible that they are ruffing with their natural trump winner. |
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Once the Q of diamonds is played, betty can win the return (say a spade), and draw two rounds of trumps. if they are 3-2, she makes the hand, simply losing a heart, cashing her  clubs and cross ruffing diamonds and spades. Unfortunately, hearts don't split so she is down 1, but that is the best line.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N I have no good leads here. A trump will likely give away a trick. I cant lead away from my ace. Generally doubletons are not a good lead, especially when you are long in trumps. So, the aggressive lead is a diamond, hoping pard has the Q or ace.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N Since I led low, I am showing an honor, so betty should really signal with the 9, since the Q is a good card. One of the kibs brought up a good question about betty's play however.|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N It was suggested that betty's 3 shows count.  However, you should in general play attitude, particularly on opening leads. You should only play count if it is obvious you don't like the suit. For example, if I lead A from AK and QJ in dummy, clearly pard doesn't like the suit. So in that case pard should give count. but when in doubt, show attitude.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N I think we went over the lead and defensive carding issues on this hand. let us discuss one aspect of the bidding.  As most of you know, I recommend when you make a takeout double, if you are an unpassed hand, you are showing opening strength.  However, there is one exception to that rule that you might want to consider playing.|
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N If the auction goes  1@H - P - 2@H or 1@S - P - 2@S, and you have the appropriate distribution, shortness in hearts and support for the other 3 suits, including 4 cards in the other  major, you might want to make a takeout double anyway. Marty Bergen calls this an "OBAR" double, which stands for "Over Bid and Raise."  If you play OBAR doubles, partner does not need an opening hand, just good distribution. And betty has the perfect hand for an OBAR double.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N I know many teachers believe in leading an unbid major against NT, but I think 4th best from your best suit works out better more often than not.  However, you should not lead your best suit if the opponents have bid it. Other than that, I suggest you always lead your best suit. it saves thinking, and helps partner out, knowing you are consistent. When leading high with no honor, if the 10 is my highest, and I don't have the 9, I tend to save the 10 and lead my 2nd highest, as in this case. often the 10 works out to be an important card.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N You will note I led back a heart right away after taking the ace, forcing betty to guess. The point is, you have to remember, even though you as defender know that a finesse is working, declarer does not.  So, if you have to, confidently play a suit where a finesse works, because psychologically, it is hard for declarer to take the finesse if you play the suit back quickly.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N For those wondering, reverse Bergen is the same idea, except the meaning of 3 clubs and 3 diamonds is reversed, 3 clubs being stronger than 3 diamonds.  have a slight preference for reverse Bergen. The reason is, it is more likely you might want to explore for game over a limit raise than a weaker raise, and 3@C therefore gives you more room to explore. But for now Ira, 3@D is a limit raise. BTW, if I had good diamonds, I should make a lead directing double.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N Now betty, once you make a limit raise, you cannot bid game if Ira decides to stop at 3 spades. You have described your hand very well, and left the decision up to Ira. You cannot override his decision.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N He knows if he has 6 spades or not. That is an important point. on almost every hand, someone is the "captain" and in charge of placing the final contract. Quite often, it is responder. |
PG| ***** 166 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N However, in the case where opener opens 1 of a major, and responder shows a non-game forcing raising, opener is the captain. Therefore, you have to respect opener's decision. Please ask for undo and bid accordingly.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N ally's lead is very reasonable. however, my wife ava has a theory that leading K from KQx is a bad lead. And, since she told me that, I have noticed it is often true. So, although you sometimes should lead K from KQ, be aware it seems to work out badly more than you might think (like on this hand.)|

^*Bhondo717:^*N Ira played it well. He knew it was hopeless. Basically, he needs diamond tricks to make the hand, so he has to hope ally has the A of diamonds. Now, it is the bidding that needs to be discussed. Ira does have a problem over 3@C.  With his good clubs,  we might very well have 3N. However, he really only has 1 spade stopper.  I do recommend being aggressive when bidding games, so 3N is not totally unreasonable. On the other hand,  a better bid by him might be 3@S, asking if I have a spade stopper.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N That is what I probably would have done. I don't want to give up on 3N, but am not comfortable bidding it unilaterally.|

** Rarely is the lead of the opponents suit a good lead. in fact, if my pard does it, I assume they have a singleton. 

** Misfits play particularly badly at 3N, because transportation between the 2 hands is difficult.

** You should in general play attitude, particularly on opening leads. You should only play count if it is obvious you don't like the suit. For example, if I lead A from AK and QJ in dummy, clearly pard doesn't like the suit.|
