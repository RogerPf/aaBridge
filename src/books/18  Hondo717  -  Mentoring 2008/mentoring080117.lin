^d @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of most boards, if not all, the viewer would be able to play the hand double dummy or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. You can begin when |cp|8|at|^*BDouble D PLAY^*N|CP||FP||at| is shown at the right lower corner of the chat box.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie.

UP|40|NT| 
hondo717: Now this is an interesting hand in bidding tactics. First of all some people would bid 1@H or 2@H with my hand over 1@D. And indeed, had terry not opened, I would have opened 2 hearts. However, because all my points are outside of hearts, I chose not to bid my hearts, as they were long but not too strong. But many would choose to bid 1@H or 2@H, and that would be ok. Now, once kia bids hearts, I have a clear 4@H bid, as I know we have an 11 card fit and, as you see we make 4 hearts. On the other hand, I was afraid that by bidding 4@H I might push them into 5@D, which could easily make.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT|
So I chose a "tactical" 3@H bid, to make it difficult for them to bid, but not push them into game. It turns out because hearts are 1-1, they go down 1 in 5@D, but our plus 200 is better than the plus 50 we get if they bid 5@D. My tactics worked out ok, although 4@H is a perfectly reasonable bid. If they bid 4@D I let them play it there, which turns out to be wrong because of the heart split. To answer terry's question whether he should bid 3@D. Yes, I think terry should bid 3@D, he has a singleton heart and a six card suit. When he opens 1@D, pard is not even sure if he has real diamonds.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT|
A couple of kibs were not sure of debs 1N bid. I think that is a reasonable bid. However, 2 other reasonable bids would be 2@C and 2@D (inverted.) I can't say I favor one over the other. they all have merit.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


AT|
Badmonster: Looking at my 9 hcps I'm not thinking slam, If we have slam, Terry's going to make a move. So, we're looking at game. With minors you're thinking NT before you're thinking game in a minor. My hand isn't good enough for a 2/1 bid. So 2@c feels wrong. I didn't particularly loved 1NT  but I thought it the best bid for what I was holding.|

hondo717: This is one hand where there is a big difference between 2 over 1 system and sayc. In sayc, which is what we are bidding, kia's 2@H bid only promises 10 points. If I had a minimum hand with hearts, I would only bid 3@H, and kia would bid 4 with an opener. However, since I have 19 points, I know we should be in game, so I bid 4@H and then kia can now think about slam, since he has a solid opener, and knows we have a fit in 2 suits. Next, I suggest 4NT, on the off chance we are missing 2 key cards. BTW, although we made 7, that was only because the spade finesse worked. you should only bid grands that are 75% or more, and this is only 50%.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT|
hondo717: I think RKC is a terrific convention. I rarely cue bid any more. Further, there is one wrinkle to cue bidding in this auction that I already mentioned. Technically, kia could cue bid the ace of spades. But, that is an ambiguous bid, because I might interpret that as simply preferring spades over hearts. So kia cannot cue bid 4@S on that particular auction. Generally speaking, 4NT is good enough in looking for slam. The only time cue bidding is better is on distributional hands where there is shortness. I suggest you stick to Blackwood for the most part. cue bidding often gets you into trouble.|

hondo717: The question is about the 2@H bid. A better bid by judy would be 3@H right away. That is still preemptive, but shows 4 hearts. According to my competitive guidelines, it is ok to compete to the 3 level with a 9 card fit. 3 hearts is still preemptive. With a limit raise or better, judy should bid 2@C. In fact some kibs suggested judy bid 4@H. I think that is a tad too aggressive, but I like it better than 2@H.|

hondo717: roberta should consider playing a 2nd club rather than the diamond. Do not be afraid to make declarer ruff, that rarely gives away a trick. You know there is a bad trump split. So making declarer use trumps is a good thing. Plus your diamond play set up declarer's suit. As you can't ruff, there is really no reason to lead your doubleton.|

hondo717: barb made a slight error in not leading the Q of hearts to repeat the finesse. It was not a big deal, as barb can get back to her hand with a diamond, but just easier to lead Q.  Then, once she sees the bad trump split, she should draw 3 rounds of trump, ruff the club, and run diamonds, waiting for me to trump. That way, she always loses just 1 heart, 1 club, and 1 spade. So really no reason to play the spade. however, the spade play did not really hurt. |

hondo717: First let us discuss barb's opener. In modern bridge, most everyone will open her hand. However, there is a question as to whether clubs or spades are better. I mean whether to open 1@C or 1@S. So, let me talk about 5/5 hands with clubs and spades in general. There is some controversy as to whether to open them 1@C or 1@S. It used to be you always opened them 1@C, because it kept the bidding lower, as you could bid 1@S followed by 2@S. If you opened 1@S, you would have to bid 2@C followed by 3@C, which makes the bidding higher. |
PG| ***** 98 ***** |


NT|
However, modern theory says you can open 5/5 hands with clubs and spades, 1@S because it is important to get your 5 spades across ASAP, with all the preempting and bidding that now occurs. Therefore, in general, I think with 5/5 hands in the blacks, 1@S is acceptable, and I have a slight preference for it. On the other hand, with barb's hand, since her spades are not good, and her clubs are, I would have opened 1@C. To recap, in general I prefer 1@S with 5/5 hands, but only slightly, and will sometimes bid 1@C if the clubs are really good and spades not so good. |
PG| ***** 99 ***** |


NT|
Some people are concerned that you would have to reverse to show spades. That is not really true. There is much confusion about reverses anyhow. A reverse is defined as going past your suit at the 2 level to bid a new suit. So, if barb had by-passed 2@C intentionally to bid 2@S, that indeed would be a reverse. But, if the auction was already past 2@C, her 2@S bidding is not a reverse, as 2@C was not available.  The idea is reverses take up extra bidding room, but if you have already bypassed yours suit at the 2 level, the extra bidding room is gone anyway.|
PG| ***** 100 ***** |


NT|
hondo717: As to the play, as we already discussed the only problem with the hand is hearts. In this case, it is quite likely barb has the Ace of hearts, since she opened the bidding and had no spade or diamond points. So a heart to the J is indicated for sure.|

^d@e@2Whether aristocrat, lawyer, farmer, or shopkeeper fifty–six ordinary men achieved something extra- @E@3ordinary when the Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776. The British called the document treasonous and the signatories traitors – singing it was an act punishable by death. Some signers lost their home in the ensuing Revolutionary War. Others were left without their livelihood. All had put their lives on the line.

The Declaration wasn’t just a blueprint for revolution; it helped to secure the future of the United States and became the mission statement for world democracy. We’re all familiar with the famous signers of the Declaration. Here, as a weekly series we will tell you about some of the lesser-known, ordinary heroes who declared our nation’s future. This week we have two more. |cp|8|FP|2|at|

JOSEPH HEWES (1730 1779)|CP||FP||AT|
Quakers are noted for their pacifism, but Hewes, the only Quaker in the Continental Congress, was one of the strongest, most persuasive supporters of independence. After breaking ties with his church, he became the first Secretary of the Navy and a key military leader.

WILLIAM HOOPER (1742 – 1790)|CP||FP||at|
One of North Carolina's leading attorneys, Hooper was elected a delegate to the legislature in 1774. He was a staunch supporter of American liberty, much to the chagrin of his many loyalist friends and relatives. Outwardly calm and unflappable, Hooper was known to have a fondness for drinking, which may have exacerbated his declining health at a relatively young age.

hondo717: Let’s talk some about the 2@S opener. I had several questions about opening a weak 2 with another 4 card major. I am personally in favor of opening a weak 2 whenever possible, even with an outside 4 card major. I would have done the same as judy. My feeling is that the preempt is very valuable, and the outside 4 card major not that important. Sure, on occasion you may miss a major suit game, if pard has a real good hand and that major.|

hondo717: But, more often, you will make it difficult for the opponents to bid, and I think that advantage far outweighs the disadvantage of once in a great while missing a game. However, other experts disagree with me, so you just have to choose whatever style is comfortable for you. Now, my 3@H bid is forcing, so judy must bid again over 3@H. Had I passed or simply raised spades, she should pass. It turns out 5 diamonds is cold for east/west, and they never even got into the auction, so we did pretty well.|

SB|NYes.|
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


SB|E|SB|SIt is not, you should bid 4H. 3H shows an intermediate opening hand 15-17.|

SB|W|SB|E|SB|N|SB|WDoes the style of fast and slow arrival still apply?|
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


SB|SYou only use fast arrival if you are in a game forcing auction, and we are not in one.|
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


SB|WAnd if Terry wanted more room to explore, could he make a false reverse here?|
PG| ***** 146 ***** |


SB|SYes.|

hondo717: Let us talk about fast arrival, since there is some confusion. Fast arrival is a principle of 2/1 and 4th suit forcing. It says, once you are in a game forcing situation, if you bid game quickly, you are not interested in slam. Whereas if you take your time and go slowly, you are interested in slam. However, on this hand, we are not in a game forcing situation. I can bid 1@H with as little as 5 or 6. If you as opener know we have game, you have to bid it, because I can pass with a weak hand. A 2@H by you would show 12-14, 3@H shows 15-17, and 4@H shows 18 or more. Is that clear terry?|

hondo717: If trumps break 3-1 or better, I have 12 tricks. My plan for play is to draw two rounds of trump, and pitch 1 club on the K of diamonds, and ruff 2 clubs in dummy. Of course seeing 4 hands, I know that wont work, but I will play it the way I would normally.|

hondo717: so I made a plan. but had to revise it once I found out the bad news. I dont expect you to see the end play, but if your first plan doesnt work, try and come up with an alternative, even if it is unlikely,|

hondo717: Let me make a comment on the play here terry. When you lead the singleton spade off the board, if deb ducks, it is unlikely she has the ace. Because she knows if she does not take it, you can ruff spades. So you should play the J of spades, not the K. If she ducked the A of spades, tell her nice play, and don't play with her anymore, lol|

hondo717: The bidding is the most important, as we should be in game. If we were playing sayc terry, and I bid 1N over 1@S, what would you bid with your hand? The basic idea is the same as the first hand. Once I respond, showing at least 6 points, terry knows we should be in game. Therefore. it is up to him to force us there. In this case, I think 3@C over 1N would be fine.  I have at least 6 and you have 20, that is enough for game. |
