^D @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.  

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N|CP|8|AT| 

Please help me improve these movies by sending suggestions to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.|CP||FP||AT|

                                                Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

^B@2hondo717: Unfortunately for us, we should probably be in either 3N or 4@S. But that is hard to get to. I advocate opening 1N with a 5 card major, as otherwise the hand is hard to bid. So Kia was correct in opening 1N. However, had he chosen to open 1@S, we would have gotten to game. such is bridge life. More often than not, it will work out better if you open 1N. that is the general consensus these days. |

hondo717: My play is an intermediate club kia, meaning I have no suit preference for you. When I led back the club for kia to ruff, I am supposed to give a suit preference. A low club would mean kia should lead back diamonds, a high club would mean hearts. Since I had no preference, I led back an intermediate club. That tells kia he should do whatever he thinks is best, and he did. |

^B@2nome: There was no reason for me to signal here. Correct? |
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: No. It will only give info to terry. In general, you should signal your partner whenever possible on defense, as it usually helps. However, if you know partner is immaterial, as on this hand, then you should not signal, because all it does is help the declarer. So, kia was right to discard low hearts on the trump leads. |

^B@2Pear: Darn I miscounted the trumps. |
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: It is common to forget when somebody ruffs, that a trump has already been played. On this hand it didn't hurt you anyway. One common declarer play mistake that you should try and avoid. Often, when counting out trumps, declarer forgets to take into account when the defenders have ruffed a trick. Even some experts make that mistake. My advice is try extra hard to remember when the opponents have ruffed, so you don't draw too many rounds of trump. On some hands it will make a difference. |

^B@2hondo717: First let me discuss the 4N bid a little more. In a competitive auction, a 4N bid is ostensibly a takeout for the minors, showing 5/5 or better. So, even if kia had raised to 4@S (not that he should on this hand), the 4N bid by deb would still be takeout for the minors. However, deb can also bid 4N with 5/5 or better in diamonds and hearts. That is because if pard bids 5@C over 4N, then deb can correct to 5@D, and pard can either pass or correct to 5@H. |
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: As far as the double goes, I probably would not do it kia. You were willing to play 3@S, so if we set them we are doing no worse than if we make 3@S. Now, as far as the play of the hand. Typically, missing 4 trumps to the Q you should play for the drop terry. However, with this auction, you should actually finesse kia for the Q. Since I am known to have 7 spades, I am more likely to be short in diamonds. My rule is, with a 9 card fit missing the Q, play for the drop most of the time. However, if one of the opponents has shown a long suit, then finesse the other opponent for the Q. |

^B@2hondo717: First the bidding. I would probably open 2@D with elizabeth's hand, particularly in 3rd seat, but her 1@D worked out better as it turns out. As most of you know by now, I think you should open a weak 2 with any 5-10 with a six card suit, even with an outside 4 card major. But that is a matter of style. I have found in general it works out well, but it is a matter of risk vs. reward. The other consideration is elizabeth's hand does meet the rule of 20, so in 1st or 2nd seat, I would open it 1@D. And a case could be made to open it 1@D in 3rd seat as well.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Now, let us discuss jana's response. First let us assume she is a passed hand. If elizabeth bid 2@D, then jana should pass, and we will find our heart fit probably. So on this hand, 1@D worked out better. And, since she is a passed hand, she might consider bidding 1@S rather than 2@C, because over 2@D I might be afraid of a misfit, and not take another bid. However, if she is willing to bid 2@S over 2@D, then 2@C was a good bid. |
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: If she was not a passed hand, then there is a whole different consideration. Playing SAYC, she can bid 2@C, as that is not a game force. Playing 2 over 1, if 2@C is a game force, then she has to bid 1@S, since she does not have a game forcing hand. On the other hand  some people who play 2 over 1 (including I), do not consider 2@C a game force  over 1@D. But these days, most people do consider it a game force. |

^B@2hondo717: Since johnny asked the question, let us first discuss the play. Once there is no heart lead, and spades break 3-2 with elizabeth holding the A of spades, the hand is cold for 5. johnny will take 5 diamonds, 5 spades, and a heart. Had he played a club from the board after only playing 1 diamond, he would have gone down, because we would take 2 club tricks and 2 heart tricks, in addition to our spade. |
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


AT|
ELIZA42: What should have I lead? |
PG| ***** 98 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: elizabeth asks a good opening lead question. A diamond is clearly wrong on the auction. A a club is wrong because of elizabeth's holding. So, she has to decide if she wants to make a passive lead of a trump or an aggressive lead of a heart. The heart lead works if I have some hearts, and we can set up heart tricks before elizabeth gets in with the ace of spades. With A10x of spades, it is possible that a spade lead might give away a trick, if I have an honor. So, I would probably lead a heart, but a spade was certainly not unreasonable. |
PG| ***** 99 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: The other consideration is, even if a heart turns out badly, when elizabeth gets in with the ace of spades, she still might have time for us to cash our clubs. As far as which heart, I would lead the 4, as I consider the J an honor. |
PG| ***** 100 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Now, let us discuss the bidding. Since jana has an opening hand, I think she should bid 4@S over 2@S. It turns out if elizabeth leads a heart, it goes down, because the Ace of clubs is behind the K. However, it really has a lot of plays. If elizabeth doesn't lead a heart it makes, and she didn't. So I would have bid 4@S with jana's hand. it pays to be aggressive when bidding games. |

^B@2hondo717: Let us discuss the play first. Experts try and avoid finesses, which are only 50%, if there is another line of play that is better. In this case, you played the hand well elizabeth, up until you trumped the club. If you realize your clubs are good, you can play 2 rounds of hearts. If hearts are 3-3, then you only lose one heart, because your diamond loser goes on the club. And even if they are not 3-3, you can still pitch your diamond on the club, because the opponents are ruffing with their natural trump trick anyway, so you still make 3. The lesson here is to find alternatives to the 50% finesse if you can. |
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: As far as the bidding, as a general rule, if one hand is very weak, it is a good idea to play in the weak hand's long suit. The high cards in the strong hand will take tricks anyway, but if you play in the weak hand's suit, the low cards in the long suit will take tricks as well. So once elizabeth bids 2@H, we should almost always play in hearts. However, because I have such a strong hand, I have a problem. Even if elizabeth has as little as K seventh of hearts, I probably want to be in game. So I chose to bid 3@H. If I had the same hand with @HAx, I probably would have bid 4. |
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Now, let us talk about the weak jump shift in general. Over one of a minor, most people play weak jump shifts, which tend to show 2-5 HCP and a long suit, at least  six cards. Typically, opener should pass most of the time. However, recently, I have decided that I do not particularly like weak jump shifts, as they do not come up that often. I play that a 2@H bid by elizabeth shows a standard weak 2, probably on the low end, say 5-8 with a six card suit.  I can then bid 2N, as if elizabeth had opened a weak 2, either as Ogust or asking for a feature. |

^B@2hondo717: However, that approach is not standard. it is my invention. Most people play the weak jump shift shows 2-5 with a 6+ card suit. |

^B@2hono717: Here, let us discuss 4th hand preempts. The purpose of a preempt is to make it difficult for the opponents to bid. You are willing to go down, in the hopes that is better than the opponents bidding. So, there certainly is little point in opening a 3 level bid in 4th seat. you might as well just pass instead. However, with an opening hand and a six card suit, you might want to open at the 2 level, to make it harder for the opponents to compete.  Further, as I will discuss later you have a good 1@S opening based on rule 15. 

^gSo I will give you an undo. |

^B@2hondo717: Why do you not bid 3@S with that hand elizabeth. You have a limit raise with 3 trumps. In fact, it is more likely that 4@S will make than 3S will go down. His 2@S simply shows a six card suit and less than 15HCP.  He could have up to 14. |

hondo717: Here is a good example of why bidding 3 with elizabeth's hand was not dangerous. They made 3 despite the fact that johnny had only ten HCPs. If he had 13, say the K of hearts, he would have made 4.|
PG| ***** 146 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: The question is how to open in 4th seat?  I personally use the rule of 20, so I would not have opened johnny's hand. However, tonight seems to be hands that work out better when you violate my rules, lol. 

There is another rule that many people use in 4th seat, known as the rule of 15. That rule says that if your HCP and spades are 15 or more, you should open. Since johnny has 10 HCP and 6 spades, for a total of 16, he can open by that rule. |

^B@2hondo717: ok, a few quick comments. First the auction. If jana had an invitational hand or more, she could bid new minor forcing. So with 10+ HCP and 5 spades, she would bid 2@C, which is new minor forcing. That would ask me to show either a 4 card heart suit, or 3 spades. In this case, with both, I show the 4 card heart suit. she would then bid 2N. Then because she bid NMF I would know she must have 5 spades, so I would then bid 3@S. |
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: However, with only 9 HCP, 2@S and/or pass is fine with her hand. Now, I have a  point regarding the play.  Once you get the heart lead, you might as well finesse elizabeth for the J of hearts. Other than that, you played it fine. |

^B@2hondo717: OK, a few things to discuss. First deb's alternatives over 1@S. It is barely possible, but very unlikely that she and kia have game. kia only bid 1@S, so he has at most 16, and probably less. Since deb has no convenient rebid, and game is remote, that is why I recommended pass. As to the opening leads, let me review my guidelines. |
PG| ***** 186 ***** |


NT| 
^B@2First, it is usually a bad idea to lead the opponents suit. Even if they open 1 of a minor, more often than not, it is a real suit.
second, it is bad to lead unsupported aces.
Third, since kia bid 2 suits, and deb showed a preference for one, it is very possible she is short in clubs. Therefore, a trump lead might work out well. |
PG| ***** 187 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Now, a couple of things on the play. when I led the J of diamonds, you should cover kia. That way, your 10 will set up on the third round. Granted, I will be ruffing the third round, but at least that forces me to play a trump, and if I have 4 trumps, that takes away a trick from me. It turns out on this hand, my playing a trump doesn't cost us a trump trick, but it might on other hands. |

^B@2hondo717: Now, to the auction. I would have bid game if I were kia and deb. Not sure it can be made. I think deb has just enough for a 4@S bid. although 3@S is certainly reasonable.  On the other hand, I think both kia and deb made reasonable but conservative decisions. I tend to like to push for close games. And, as it turns out, you only made 3, so it worked out ok. However, let me discuss why it pays to bid close games. |
PG| ***** 207 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: If you bid a close vulnerable game that no one else bids, that is worth 7 or 8 imps. And if you go down 1, you lose 3 or 4 imps. So, if you make one out of three close games, you end up breaking even or slightly ahead. And often you get misdefense, so you make games you shouldn't normally make. Basically, even if you are slightly less than 50% to make the game, it is good to bid it, based on the risk/reward calculation,|

^B@2hondo717: Had clubs broken 4-2 or 3-3, you would have made. In fact, one could make a case that you should just bid 3N over 1@S. When you have a hand with a potentially running minor, and you can count 8 tricks assuming the minor comes in, 3N is a good bid. Pard almost always has a trick for you. |

CP||FP||at|
^d@e@2Wednesday April 30th, 2008 was the last day of my six months of mentoring with Howard. @E@3Over one hour each time, twice a week, I was glued to my computer screen and tried to learn everything possible in bridge from him.  I also doubled-dipped and sent him numerous emails asking my bridge questions. He patiently discussed and explained hands that I had a hard time to bid or to play properly.

I already knew that he was a great teacher and superior mentor because while I was waiting for my  session I used to kib his previous mentoring sessions. While learning bridge, I learned other important qualities from him. I learned to be more tolerant, patient and kinder.  I learned to listen more and with interest and dignity even to those who were not in agreement with me.  I learned not to belittle anyone and to treat all with respect.  Further, from Howard I learned to control my anger and displeasure; I believe his DNA  is void for the anger gene. To me, those lessons are priceless.
