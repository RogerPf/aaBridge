^d @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of most boards, if not all, the viewer would be able to play the hand double dummy or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. You can begin when |cp|8|at|^*BDouble D PLAY^*N|CP||FP||at| is shown at the right lower corner of the chat box.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N|CP|8|AT| 

Please help me improve these movies by sending suggestions to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.|CP||FP||AT|

                                                Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

^B@2hondo717: First the bidding. If partner opens one of a major and you have 5 card support and less than a limit raise, you should always jump to 4. With a limit raise, if you are playing Bergen, you bid the limit raise (3@D if regular Bergen, 3@C if reverse Bergen), and then raise 3@H to 4@H. The reason for that is with a limit raise or better, there is some possibility you might have slam, and you don't want to close out the bidding with 4@H. With an opening hand and 5 card support, you bid Jacoby 2N, just like with 4 card support. again, you don't want to miss slam.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT|
^B@2In this hand  with a limit raise and interference, your bid would be 2@S terry - a cue bid.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


AT|
IraCT: Howard  I think if you are going to bid 4@S by yourself you should do it right away?|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Ira raises a good point. A case could be made for me bidding 4 spades right away over 1@H.  I am a bit strong to do it, but it does get in the way of the opponents. So, either 1@S or 4@S by me is reasonable.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT|
^B@2nome: I was expecting the kibs jump all over me for not opening.  What a pleasant surprise.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: ah yes, I didn't notice kia. the kibs should "jump all over you". Why didn't you open? You have a clear opening bid  using the rule of 20 (12 HCP plus 9 clubs/diamonds.)|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


AT|
nome: I did not have a good rebid that is why I did not open.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


AT| 
hondo717: well, some would open 1@D with that hand. that is fairly common practice, but I don't agree with that. If you open 1@D with 5 clubs and 4 diamonds, partner can never figure out when you rebid 2@C whether or not you have 5 diamonds and 4 clubs or 5 clubs and 4 diamonds. But I think it is ok for kia to open 1@C and rebid 2@C.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: As to the play,  I need to be slightly careful, to make sure I do not lose 2 diamonds  because I have one heart, one club and 1 spade loser (unless I choose to take the club finesse and it works.) My best line of play to guarantee I take 10 tricks is to draw trumps and knock out the K of clubs, so I can pitch one diamond on the J of clubs. So, this is a hand where you have to plan carefully, to ensure you make the contract.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT|
^B@2neofito: I prefer the singleton @D lead in this case.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


AT|
That is certainly a possibility. and it beats the contract, because terry will get 2 diamond ruffs. so I will lose a heart, a diamond and 2 ruffs. But a heart is reasonable as well.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


AT|
wbaker: After you bid 4@s shouldn't one of the opponents be willing to bid 5@h as a sacrifice.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


AT|
Badmonster: I disagree with the sacrifice idea.  We likely don't have 5@H and we don't know that Howard can make five spades by himself.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT| 
^B@2hondo717: Now, let us discuss whether or not there should be a sacrifice. terry has a clear pass. and
if he happens to choose a diamond opening lead, the hand goes down. On the other hand  5@H is a good bid, probably only down 1 at worst. deb does have a problem though. She has a good enough hand where if terry has a little something, 4@S can go down, as indeed it can albeit with an  exacting defense, which is often difficult.|

^B@2hondo717: There are a number of issues with the bidding.  The 1@S and double are fine as are the pass and 2@C. Now, terry has a problem. He has a very nice heart suit, which he would like to tell deb about. However, it is likely kia has hearts  because a takeout double tends to promise 4 cards in the other major. But, not vul, I think 2@H is pretty reasonable, because terry has such a good heart suit. Now, deb should correct to 2 spades. A 5-2 fit almost always plays better than a 4-3 fit.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


aT|
loractrue: Can terry double?|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


nT|
^B@2hondo717: terry could double, but he should have diamonds to do that. If he had a singleton club and another diamond, double would have been ok, but with his hand, 2@H or pass is right. A double asks deb to pick one of the other suits, and he really only has hearts. As you see, on the chosen defense, terry "lost control" of the hand. We ran him out of trumps and ended up cashing our long suits.  So, sometimes, it is good defense to make declarer trump, when you have long trumps as well. When defending, you should think about making declarer trump as a possible approach. At worst, it is usually passive in that it won't cost you anything.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |

^B@2wbaker: On trick nine shouldn't Nome lead a heart so that he can get the rest of the tricks?|

PG| ***** 82 ***** |


mb|p|an|even number|mb|p|NT|
^B@2hondo717: One, that deb just chose is known as "dope" which stands for "double with odd", pass with "even."  By passing, deb is showing an even number of key cards, either 0 or 2. more likely 2 since she showed a limit raise. Another way to play it is "d0p1", which is double with zero, pass with 1. However, I dont like that as well. In third way, "double" is "stolen bid", which means deb would have bid 5@H. Pass means deb would have bid 5@C or 5@D. And 5@S is natural -2 with the q of spades.  terry, deb decided you are playing "dope" so she is showing an even number of aces.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT| 
^B@2Badmonster: what is "standard"?|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


SB|S|AT|
hondo717: There is no standard, but "dope" is pretty popular. Now to terry, you know deb has an even number of aces. And if you knew deb had 2 aces, what would you bid terry.|

h^B@2ondo717: Very nice terry. good bidding and good playing. It turns out we make 4 hearts kia, so only down 3 in 7, but they make 7@S. One further comment.  because terry has such a powerful hand, he really can almost just bid 4N over 3@H. Normally, I do not advocate bidding blackwood with a void. However, in this case, I think it is reasonable for terry to assume if he is missing an ace it is the ace of hearts.|

^B@2@D@D@D@D@D nome : Before viewing the next boards it is time for our coffee break. One of my many joys of playing bridge is enduring barrage of criticism from a partner who, well is not such a great expert. A while back I learned the word "ultra-crepidarian" which I would have loved to use as a response in those occasions. But I have to bit my tongue and endure more. Now, I am going to choose it as the first word in my new "word of the week" series. So let us say good bye to "history" and welcome "word of the week." |

^d@e@2(ull-truh-krep-ih-DAIR-ee-uhn)

Giving opinions or criticizing beyond one's own range of expertise.|CP||FP||AT|

This marvelous, chastening word alludes to a story about Alexander the Great's favorite artist, Apelles. @E@3andIt seems that when a cobbler saw Apelles' drawing of a sandal, he criticized the way Apelles had drawn the latch, and the artist promptly corrected his error.

Emboldened, the cobbler went on to disparage the way Apelles had drawn the subject's legs. At that point, as one ancient writer put it, Apelles snapped "Ne supra crepidam judicaret," or "Let him not criticize above the sole." (Crepida, in Latin, is "sole" or "sandal.") In other words, the cobbler was qualified to judge footwear, but not more.

Centuries later, speakers of English began using ultra-crepidarian (Latin for "beyond the sole") to describe those who give opinions on matters they know little about, and ultracrepidarianism to denote that practice.

This word's first recorded use was in an 1819 letter by William Hazlitt, who opined:

"You have been well-called an ultra-crepidarian critic."

PG| ***** 104 ***** |


NT|
h^B@2ondo717: Before we proceed, let me discuss ways of bidding  5/4 in the majors over 1N. With a game forcing hand  bid stayman and then jump to the 3 level in your 5 card suit. So, with her hand, assuming you played it that way, deb could bid 2@C, and over 2@D by kia, she would bid 3@H.  If you play the "smolen" convention, and you have 5/4 in the majors, you bid Stayman. If pard respondes 2@D, you bid your FOUR card major. This tells pard your five card major is the one you did not bid. Thus, allowing him to be declarer at the 4 level with 3 card support, or 3N with 2 card support. Smolen is used to show 5/4 in the majors and a game forcing hand. |
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|NT|
^B@2hondo717: Here, deb's sequence should show 5 hearts, 4 spades, and an invitational hand. This allows kia to pass with a weak hand and 4 spades, bid 3@H with a weak hand and 3 hearts, or bid 2N with a weak hand and neither. With a stronger hand (good 16 or 17), kia would place the final contract in some game. deb has a game forcing hand, so she should have bid it  differently. But we ended up ok.|

^B@2hondo717: kia, as it worked out, you squeezed terry. He has to save the J of diamonds, and therefore only has one spade left. Therefore, you know whether or not the spade finesse works, because when you play a spade, terry has to play his only spade.|PF|Y|cp|8|at|

^B@2hondo717: Well, in this hand you were lucky, if you were in 6, I lead the ace of clubs and another club, and you have to ruff, which means you lose a heart. In fact, you might go down  2 or 3. Six is a so-so contract. assuming a reasonable spade break, it still depends on the spade finesse, or a friendly spade lead by me.|

^B@2nome: It is so difficult to keep track of cards when one of the opponents is void.|
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: I find the easiest way to count trumps is to just remember how many the opponents have left. Since you started with 8 hearts, we started with 5. Once I show out, you now know terry had 5 to start wtih. The method of counting how many have been played is much harder than keeping track of how many the opps have left.|
