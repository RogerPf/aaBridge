^D @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.  

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  SIMPly click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie.

PG| ***** 4 ***** |


SB|SSure. |
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


SB|EWould Howard pre-empt with my hand with 4 card major suit?|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Yes I do. I put little stock in having an outside 4 card major. The purpose of a preempt is to jam the opponents. It is a risk/reward calculation. In my opinion, the reward for preempting far outweighs the very small risk that you will miss a major suit game. Conventional wisdom is that you should not preempt with an outside 4 card major, but I do not agree. You must form your own opinion. Even on this hand, where it turns out you have a 4-4 fit, 3@D is a better contract than spades. |

^B@2hondo717: This hand is a very good example of why I do not worry about preempting with an outside 4 card major. It turns out you do have an eight card spade fit. However, at best you can make 3@S. and, if we force Kia to ruff a couple of clubs, he will lose entries to his hand, and his diamonds will be completely worthless. So, it is likely that 3@S goes down, whereas 3@D makes. The basic principle here is that, with a weak hand and a long suit, it is best to play in the long suit. That way the low cards in the long suit can take tricks, and the high cards in the stronger hand still take tricks. |

^B@2hondo717: I offer this hand as a good example of why I do not worry about preempting with an outside 4 card major. Having said that, many people you play with will disagree, so you have to take that into account.|

^B@2hondo717: Bid 2NT which shows 18-19 balanced hand and kia should bid 3N on virtually any hand worth a response. 2N is a very precise bid and is pretty much forcing, unless you were stretching. I will give you the undo.|

hondo717: Now in this situation, I normally would lead back my "remaining count" in spades. So, if I started with 3, and have two left, I would lead high-low, to show 2 remaining. If I started with 4, and have 3 left, I would lead low, to show 3 left. This makes it easy for aggie to figure out what moe has in his hand. My Jack probably indicates I have 2 left (or possibly just the J.)|

^B@2hondo717: Well done moe. Let us go over moe's club play, and the general idea involved. It is a little confusing, because your play as defender is different than your play as declarer. Your objective as defender is to help your partner figure out what you have. Towards that end, had moe been defending and a club led, he should play the J, the bottom of his sequence, to let pard know about his possible K and Q. If he plays the K as defender, that would deny the Q and J. The idea as defender is to tell your partner what you have as best you can. However, as declarer, your objective is to not reveal your hand to the defense until you have to. Thus, here if moe plays the J on the club, and aggie doesn't win, I now know that aggie does not have the Q or K.|

^B@2hondo717: Now, I have an interesting bidding problem.  Had kia passed, my best bid is probably 2 hearts. When my partner opens 1@H, and I have a weak raise, I tend to raise right away. That has 2 purposes. It gives my partner a pretty good idea what I have, and slightly preempts the opponents. So, with a weak hand and hearts, I will usually bypass spades, because the 2@H bid usually works out better.  However, kia's 2@C bid makes my hand a bit better. My void in clubs is really golden. But, I will still probably just bid 2@H, because it is quite possible moe will raise to 3@C, and if I bid anything else, it may be hard for pard to realize we have a heart fit. |

^-{        A BRIEF REVIEW OF MP AND IMP SCORING        }
^-|FP||CS||CP||AT|
^C@e@2hondo717: kia has been asking about how the IMP scoring and match point scoring works. And this would @E@3  be a good time to have that discussion. In IMP, basically, the way it works is that you are compared against 12 or 15 or maybe 16 other tables who play the same hand. They take the average score of the tables. If you beat the average, you gain IMPs. On the other hand, if you are lower than the average you lose IMPs. The IMPs are very much correlated with the actual difference between your score and average. So, if the average score is +100 in your direction, and you score +110, or even + 130, that is pretty much meaningless, worth less than an IMP. |
PG| ***** 100 ***** |


AT|

However, if you score +500, you are 400 better than average, and that is very good. In IMP the idea is to maximize your score, but not worry about small differences.  The IMP scale is used to flatten out the effect of large swings. A 500 above average is not 10 times better than 50 above average, ,probably only 7 or 8 times as good. But the idea is still for you to create large plusses for yourself, and not worry about small plusses or minuses. That is why you should stretch for game. +620 is 450 points better than +170 which can net you a lot of IMPs. |
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


AT|

delcod1: So going down on the hand just played is of no consequence ...right?|
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


AT|

hondo717: As long as kia and moe can make a partial, going down will not hurt you too much, especially -100. The idea on a partial hand is to go plus if you can, either by beating them or making the contract. On this hand, moe and kia are probably slightly better off than you, but it still will be a relatively small score. |
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


AT|

certagen: So between. +90 & -100 no difference? |
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


AT|

hondo717: No, that is a big difference, 190 points equals to 5 IMPs. However, there is no difference between -90 and -100, if that was your question. Therefore,  the important point is to go plus on partials if you can, and bid game when you can, even if you have to stretch. Next, I have the Point Difference/IMP schedule which you can look at later. |

hondo717: Now, if you play at your local bridge club, they use a different form of scoring known as match @E@3 points. Match Point scoring is easy to understand, but requires somewhat different bidding tactics.  In match point scoring, you get 1 point for everyone you beat, and half point for  everyone you tie. If the board is played 13 times, and everyone gets exactly the same score, everyone gets 6 points (tied 12 pairs) and if you get a better score than everyone else, you get 12 points, since you beat 12 pairs. In this system the  amount of the score (whether +620 or 170) is irrelevant. What is IMPortant is whether you had a better score than someone. So, if you get 170 and all other pairs scored 140, you still get a point. Even if you bid game and the hand made 620 instead of 170, still only one point if your opponent only made 140.|

hondo717: That means you are trying to score better than everyone else, but you don't care by how much. Therefore, you sometimes risk a contract to try for an overtrick. You try and avoid minor suit contracts as they are worth only 20 points a trick. For example, if you bid and make 3 diamonds you get +110. However if you make 2N, one less trick, you get +120 and beat everyone who made +110. |

^-{        A BRIEF REVIEW OF MP AND IMP SCORING        }
^-|FP||CS||CP||AT|
^C@e@2Two good tactics in match points are as follows:

* Avoid minor suit contracts if you can. Obviously if you have a long suit and are missing stoppers, bid @E@3 minor suits, otherwise try for NT.

* Try to force the opponents to the 3 level at least. |

certagen: But maybe  MP give more credit to competition, whereas IMP is better bridge bidding? |
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


AT|

hondo717: The comment/question is a good one. Most really top notch players think IMPs is a better form of scoring, as there is less luck involved. However, I personally prefer match points, as I think it is a much more interesting game. In MP on every hand, you are trying to maximize the number of tricks you take. In IMPs, for example, once they are in game, doesn't matter if they make 4 or 5. Conversely, in match points, if you are defending and take one more trick than the other pairs, even if they still make their contract, you will do very well. That is why I like match points, because every hand you have to concentrate. |

^B@2hondo717: Now, let us review how DONT works. Over a 1N opener, either in direct seat or balancing seat, a suit bid shows 2 suits, that suit and a higher suit. So 2@C shows clubs and another suit, 2@D shows diamonds and a majors, and 2@H shows hearts and spades.  Responses to a DONT bid work as follows:
With 3 card support for the bid suit, responder passes. With less than 3 card support, responder bids the next higher suit. This allows the DONT bidder to pass if that is the second suit, or bid the next suit if it is not. So, in this case roberta should bid 2@H.|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Granted it is likely from her perspective that my 2nd suit is hearts, but it could be spades. So by bidding 2@H, we are no worse off, and might be better off if my suit happened to be spades.  The other part of DONT is that you double with a one suited hand. Partner then bids 2@C, allowing the DONT bidder to pass with clubs or bid his suit. |
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


AT|
Melonaide: Are there point  restrictions. |
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


AT|  hondo717: You can bid DONT with as little as 4/4 if you have close to an opener, and with as little as 8 or 9 points if you are 5/5. If you are 5/4, probably should have 10 or 11. 
Okay, let us play the next board.|

^B@2hondo717: with 3 card support, it is best to compete with any excuse, and since you have a singleton spade, and no points in their suits. Your hand is pretty good for 5 HCP. You can count the singleton, in fact it is very valuable once dorothy bids spades. Aggressive bidding is best, as long as you follow my completive bidding guidelines.|

^B@2hondo717: First of all, mel, why did you open 1@C?  Your correct bid is 1@D, unless you play short club.  Some people think "better minor" means the minor with more high cards. But it means the longer minor. if you play better minor, you never open with a 2 card suit. We will discuss short club in a minute.  Convenient minor is better. Some people play "short club."  Absent partnership agreement, convenient minor is standard. |
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: However, many play "short club" and they want 1@D to promise a 4 card diamond suit. Therefore, occasionally, on hands where you are 4-4-3-2, as mel is on this hand, you open a 2 card club suit. And short club must be alerted.  If you play short club, there is a misconception that partner must bid over 1@C, even with less than 5 or 6 points.  That is not true, partner still can pass 1@C with a weak hand. If you play that 1@C forces a bid from pard, then you will often get too high on many hands. So, if you play short club, partner still should not respond with less than 5 or 6. I personally prefer convenient minor. It turns out in real life, about 85% of the time, partner has a 4 card minor when he opens one of a minor. |

hondo717: First why not leave him in 1N? And, no, you can assume kia has clubs. 85% of the time he will have 4, and will always have at least 3. If you were playing new minor forcing, then 2@D would be new minor forcing.  kia opened 1@C, so if you bid the other minor, that is known as new minor forcing.  It asks kia to show 3 card heart support in this case. otherwise he would bid 2NT. The 2@D is not natural, even though in this case you happened to have diamonds.|

^B@2hondo717: Now you know kia has 3 hearts. You already knew he did not have 4 spades since he bid 1N over 1@H. BTW, on that auction he has to have at least 4 clubs, because he doesn't have 4 spades nor 4 hearts, so he must have clubs. |

PG| ***** 213 ***** |


mb|1S|NT|
^B@2hondo717: With your hand, I would open 1@S in 1st seat, 4@S in 3rd seat. The issue here is tactics. If you open 4@S in 1st seat, much of the time that will work out. However, occasionally you will miss a slam. With 1@S opening in the first seat, not much danger of being passed out, because if pard passes, then opps will probably bid. The Important issue is, do you want to allow the opponents to pass information about their hands. Thus, the tradeoff being, you might miss slam if you open 4@S. On the other hand, if you are third seat, then chances of slam are slim, so 4@S is a better bid. |

^B@2hondo717: You have a 3@D bid aggie, as that is forcing. Your hand has gotten better as the auction proceeded. you have support for kia and a singleton in our suit.

^B@2hondo717: Good question aggie. This is the rule I use when bidding Blackwood. 
1) If one person has bid a suit, and that suit has been raised by his partner, that is the key card suit.
2) Otherwise, the last suit bid is the key card suit. It may be, in fact, that suit will not end up as trumps, but, as far as the responder(you) to RKCB is concerned, the K and Q in that suit should be counted when responding. |
PG| ***** 221 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: On this hand, diamonds is the last suit bid, so, from your perspective, that should be the key card suit, and you should count the K of diamonds as a key card, and the Q of diamonds if you had two key cards. As to kia's bid, I like the fact that he is aggressive and thinking about slam. However, he is missing a lot of key cards (3 to be exact, assuming spades to be trumps). So it is very possible that he might go down in 5 and make 4. He has to weigh that against the risk of missing 6. My feeling is, with an expert partners, if you bid 4@S, and they have all those key cards, they might very well try for slam themselves. So 4@S is better than 4N. Kia gets points for being aggressive but not for a correct bidding.|

nome: The lead should be fourth best. Then, aggie should have at least the J and you most likely have the K. Based on those assumption I would play my Q.|

^B@2hondo717: Very nice aggie. the only lead that beats the contract. Usually it is wrong to lead the opponents suit. However, in the absence of a better lead, if you have 2 honors in declarer's suit against a NT contract lead that suit. Sometimes it works out well as on this hand. aggie, you made the same lead an expert might make. Your only other choice was a club which was bid as well. |
