^B@2hondo717: moe you did fine, since we can make 3@S, and you are only -100. Now, let me explain balancing. Basically, if the opponents have found a fit, and you suspect the points are evenly spread, you can "balance", which means compete, if you are in pass out seat, even with not a  particularly good hand.  The reason for this is two fold. First, if we are at the 2 level, odds are we have no more than 22 HCP or so, which means your side has 18. So, no matter how many points you have, your pard has to have some points as well.  In kia's case, since he has 9 points, he can reasonably expect pard to have 10 or so. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: So he is essentially bidding both his points and his partner's points. The second part of balancing is that the opponents must have found a fit. In this case, that was clear, since aggie raised my spades right away. The reason the opponents have to find a fit is, if they have a fit, it is likely you have a fit. I will explain the math, although you do not really have to understand it, as long as you remember "if they have a fit, you have a fit." The math works as follows: Let us assume we had a 9 card fit, because that is a good example. That means, between you and your partner, you only have 4 cards in our trump suit. Since you and your pard  have 26 cards between the two of you, 22 of your cards are outside are trump suit (26 - 4.) |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717:  Therefore, mathematically you must have at least one 8 card fit (if you had only 3 7 card fits, that would make 21 cards outside trump, and you have 22.) The idea is, if you are short in one suit, it is likely you are long in another. To summarize, kia can confidently make a takeout double, and assume he will find an 8 card fit. Partner should realize he is only balancing, and not get carried away with bidding, because he realizes kia is "borrowing" some of the points kia knows partner already has. The reason to balance is that often you might either make the hand, or force the opponents one level higher, and they might go down. |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Now, let me talk a little about the defense.  I might have carded a little differently. After I lead the A of spades, I should lead the Q not the K, because aggie already knows I have the K and after I lead the K of clubs, similarly, I should lead the J, not the Q, since aggie knows I have the Q. That gives her more information about my hand. in fact, if she counts my points, AKQ of spades, and KQJ of clubs, for a total of 15, it is pretty clear I have no more points since I passed 2@S. The reason I switched to clubs instead of playing a third spade is, first I wasn't positive moe had another spade, and second, I wanted to set up club tricks.  OK next hand. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT|
                 @D@D@D nome: please note that you can play this and all other borads double dummy if you wish.  However, you have to do it before you click the forward arrow. |

^B@2hondo717: Not much to this hand. The auction was fine. aggie could bid 3@H, since she has a pretty good hand, if she assumes they have an 8 card fit in spades. But pass is ok as well. more a style issue. Also, moe could bid 2S over double. he is a bit weak, but good to compete. aggie probably should practice being a bit more aggressive, just to see if you are comfortable with it. It does turn out 3@H makes on this hand, because of the favorable heart position. |

^B@2hondo717: It turns out 4 spades is down 1, losting a heart a club and 2 diamonds. But, it is very unusual for a vulnerable sacrifice to be right against non-vul opponents as I would doubled kia's 4@S. As to kia's lead. It turns out he made the best lead. But, as most of you know, usually you should not lead unsupported aces. If I were on lead, I would have led a diamond. From the auction, it sounds like we have to set up clubs for pitches, and I want to set up our tricks ASAP. Since kia has the ace of clubs, he knows he will get in once before we set up clubs, so a diamond seems safe. |
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: There are four possible bids that aggie can make, all of which have some merit. I will list them in my preferred order, from most to least preferred, and explain the merits of each:
1) 2@C - describes a 5 card club suit, and shows at least 10 HCP, so is reasonably descriptive. However, I will never work out aggie has as many hearts as she does. On the plus side, allows me to value my club points.
2) 4@D - shows her singleton diamond and at least 4 trumps. However, she is just a smidge short of HCP. The plus side is, by default, I will value club points a lot, and will know that I need a spade stopper in order to bid slam. And,|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT|
^B@23) 2@S -- limit raise or better. Shows trump length the best, and describes the HCP accurately.
4) 4@H - there is some likelihood the opponents may find a diamond sacrifice, and this tactically gets in their way the best. However, there is some chance you will miss slam. I consider this much worse than choices 1-3, but most of the time it will work out fine.|

^B@2hondo717: J of diamonds is probably your best lead, generally doubletons are not good leads. Of course on this hand it does not work, lol, but still right in general, and no  worse than a club. |

^B@2hondo717: Let us discuss the auction. There are a couple of issues with moe's bidding. First, some people play the 3@D bid promises a limit raise with 4 trump, although some play it only promises 3 trump. You have to agree whether or not the cue bid promises 4 card support or not. I prefer to play it shows 4 card support, but many people play it only promises 3. The other problem with the cue bid is moe knows there is a bit of a misfit, because of aggie's diamond bid. So I would probably only bid 2@S with his hand, believe it or not. But, 3@D is not totally unreasonable. However, once kia bids 3@S, you have a clear pass |
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: You have already shown your hand 10 points or so with spades.  kia decided to only bid 3@S. since you have nothing extra, pass is best. If you had, say, an opening hand, then you could override kia and bid 4@S, because you then would have something extra. |

^B@2hondo717: As you all know I can see all the hands.  However, I made my correct bid even with kia's hand. And now, my best play is to assume the clubs will break no worse than 4-2, in which case I have nine tricks. The 4-2 break is close to 90%, whereas the heart finesse is only 50%, and since kia cleverly led a diamond, I have no entry back to my hand to try both. had he led a spade, I would have made it.|

^B@2hondo717: I like the bidding through 3@S. moe has an excellent reverse, with 18 HCP. However, over 3@S, he should get suspicious that things may be breaking badly, and consider doubling. At best, they have an 8 card fit, since I have at least 4 spades. It is not clear what is right, just saying a double should be considered. It turns out kia is down 2, taking 6S and a diamond. It is not always obvious. The only reason there is some justification is because you know that they don't have a big fit in spades.|

^B@2nome: Is there a reason for me to hold up here based on Rule 11. |
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: how do you know that? aggie could have the ace and/or the Q. You know she probably has 4 hearts, and therefore moe has 2, but you don't know what they are. Playing K is always right here. Rule of 11 works as follows. There are 9 cards higher than the 2 out between you, dummy, and moe - 11 - 2 (what aggie led) is 9. Therefore, moe has two cards higher than the 2, but you knew that anyway on this hand, So really, you know very little about hearts, other than moe has 2. |

^B@2hondo717: Good bidding and defense on this hand, once we got the heart situation straight in our minds. Now, let me briefly discuss opening 1N with a 5 card major. I like to open 1N with any balanced 15-17, even with a 5 card major, and that seems to be the majority opinion these days. It turns out we make either 3@S or 2N, so it works out about the same. The reason I like opening 1N is because otherwise it is hard to bid the hand. Showing intermediate 15-17 hands is difficult. |

^B@2hondo717: Some people would open moe's hand 1@S, since his spades are so strong, he could bid 3@S over whatever I bid even though 3@S ostensibly shows 6 card spade suit, his spades are good enough that it is only a small lie. |

nome: And you would have accepted his invitation to 4@S?|
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Yes, if moe opens 1S, we probably get to 4, and go down 1. All in all, as I said, I like 1N better. But those of you who prefer 1@S, that is ok too, but only because the spades are strong. In general, I think opening 1N, even with a 5 card major, is best.|

^B@2hondo717: You have an opener, by rule of 20. You have 12 HCP, plus 8 cards in your 2 longest suits, for a total of 20, so you should have opened. |

nome: Also I heard opening a hand with two aces and a king, any comment please. |
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: I don't open balanced 11 counts, even with AK in one suit and A in other suit. Some people count "quick tricks." Quick tricks are related to aces and kings. An ace is one quick trick, king a half quick trick, AK two, KQ one, and AQ one and half. Some people open any hand with 2.5 quick tricks, no matter how many points. But I don't use that rule. However, by that rule aggie has 3 quick tricks and an opening hand.|

^B@2hondo717: Why did you pass kia, and what are your choices? Not saying pass is wrong, but there are other possible bids.|
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


AT|
nome: We are in competitive bidding, I do not have support, I have the suit you just bid and I have only four spades. |
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


AT| 
hondo717: well, a negative double is a good bid. That shows exactly 4 spades. with 5 spades, you bid 1@S. Your other choices are  1N, and pass. Each has merit.|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |

^B@2nome: What if she bid @C over my double? |
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Then you would bid 2N. Also  a case could be made for 2@D, since it is likely she has 5 diamonds at least. If aggie bid 2@C over the double, statistically it tends to show that she has 5 diamonds. We had this discussion in one of our earlier session. |

^B@2nome: Again I have no clue what is the best bid here. It appears the the points are evenly distributed and a pass seems to be best. |
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


AT| 
hondo717: Well, you have a good hand, but because of your hearts, there might be a misfit. So pass is the conservative view point. |

^B@2hondo717: aggie played that hand very well. she was lucky both finesses worked, if either hadn't, or the minor suits were split a little differently, she would have made only 2 or 3. However, playing the hand on a cross ruff was excellent. Nice going aggie.  And kia's pass although reasonable, did not work out well, since it turns out you made game.  

Let us move to the next board.|

delcod1: Then double ok here?|

hondo717: If you are not playing DONT, double shows a strong hand, but playing DONT, it shows a single suit.|

hondo717: moe we are playing systems on here, so all bids have the same meaning as if aggie passed. Therefore, my bid simply is a heart transfer. |

nome: And now DONT is off correct?|
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


AT|    hondo717: Correct, you no longer have to bid. Had I passed, you must bid 2@C, to allow aggie to show her suit|

^B@2hondo717: Very good bidding on everyone's part. We make 2@H, but not 3, so 3@D is the "par" result. The "par" result is the best both sides can do, which, in this case is 3@D. If you tie or beat the par result on most hands, you will score well.  moe did well to pass, since we are vul.  However, if we are not vul, he should consider a 3@H bid, due to his doubleton diamonds and very good hearts. 3@H would have been aggressive but ok. On the other hand, aggie had a good hand and good suit, and was not vul, so I like her 3@D bid.|
