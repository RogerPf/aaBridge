^d @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of most boards, if not all, the viewer would be able to play the hand double dummy or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. You can begin when |cp|8|at|^*BDouble D PLAY^*N|CP||FP||at| is shown at the right lower corner of the chat box.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N|CP|8|AT| 

Please help me improve these movies by sending suggestions to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.|CP||FP||AT|

^B@2hondo717: Now let us discuss responding over 2@C. Most people these days play 22D as waiting, which means 2@D is almost automatic over 2@C, regardless of what responder has. The only time responder shows a suit is if they have a good suit. A good suit is defined as 5+ cards with at least two of the top 3 honors. So anne's 2@H bid was good, as she had a good heart suit. The only complication is that some people play that 2@H by responder shows a bust hand, no Aces or Kings. If you play that, then anne cannot bid 2@H. If 2@H shows a bust, then 2N is used by many to show hearts which is probably the best solution.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


NT| 
^B@2hondo717: Some people play "steps" over 2@C, although I do not particularly care for them myself. If you play steps, then you show the number of "controls" you have. An ace is considered 2 controls, and a K is considered one.
For example, if responder has one ace and one k, he has 3 controls. Then, 2@D shows 0 or 1 control (no more than a K), 2@H shows 2 controls (one ace or 2 kings),  2@S shows 3 controls - specifically an ace and a K  and 2N shows 3 controls - specifically 3 kings. 3@C shows 4 or more controls, which rarely occurs. My problem with steps is they take up too much bidding room and I recommend you play 2@D waiting.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


NT| 
^B@2hondo717: For this particular hand, the 2@H bid was fine, once terry bids 2N, anne can just about bid 6 clubs, since terry cannot have 2 doubletons. The real question is, is 3@C natural or stayman. You have to have an agreement. It certainly is stayman had anne responded 2@D, but once she bids 2@H, it is not as clear. Playing with an unfamiliar partner, I would have bid 6 clubs with anne's hand, just to ensure no disasters but 3@C was quite reasonable, assuming it shows clubs.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


NT| 
^B@2hondo717: anne could bid 4N over 3N, rather than 6@C, which is RKCB for clubs, but she is committed to six clubs anyway, so might as well bid it. And then she could decide to bid 6N, which makes even against a bad club split but 6 clubs is fine.|

^B@2hondo717: terry, that is 4th suit forcing (4SF), doesn't show clubs per se. You are now forced to game, and deb's next bid will clarify what is going on. 4SF is explained well in my first tutorial on 2 over 1. You can read it at ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/2over1part1.pdf ^*N. However, I will give you a more detailed explanation after play if this deal.|

^B@2hondo717: Interesting hand. first lets go over the auction.  deb needs to make a game forcing bid, and 4 suit forcing is a good method to play. In this case 3@C, a4SF, is an artificial bid. All it does is establish a game force. deb's next bid will clarify why she bid 3@C. Here she was hoping terry had spades and if not, he might bid 3N over 3@C if he had clubs stopped. After a 3@H bid, deb's 3@S says, "Pard I have a game forcing hand with very good spades." But terry had a big problem. He doesnt really have spades nor does he have a club stopper. Therefore,  his 4@S bid is reasonable, his only other choice is 4@D which is not that appetizing either. It turns out that either 4 spades or 5 diamonds are their best spots|

^B@2hondo717: kia has a tough opening lead problem. You can make a case for leading anything but a heart. I would personally have led a club, because the opponents shied away from 3N. The Ace of clubs in particular. however, leading unsupported aces is often a bad lead, so I don't blame kia for not leading a club. Another choice would be a spade, although that could give something away if I have a spade honor. Given he has the ace of spades, I think the @DJ  is a very good choice. I might win a second diamond and give kia a ruff. I normally do not advocate leading a suit bid by the opponents, but in this case a diamond lead has merit.|

^d@e@2Fourth suit forcing (4SF) is a convention most experts play as a way of establishing @E@3a game forcing auction while keeping the bidding at a lower level. Although it is independent of the 2 Over 1 System and can be played as part of Standard American, I include a description here because it is based on the same principles.

It works as follows. Assume partner has opened a suit, you have responded in a different suit, and opener has bid a third suit. If you bid the only remaining suit (the 4th suit), that is an artificial bid which establishes a game forcing auction. It says nothing about the 4th suit, only that responder is unsure about where to play the hand, but wants to play in game. The partner may not pass below the game level, and responder's next bid clarifies why he made the fourth suit forcing call.

There are many reasons why responder would choose to bid 4sf. Here are some of the more common reasons: Responder's first suit was a 5 card major, and he would like to find out if opener has 3 card support. Since opener did not raise the major right away, he does not have four. But over 4SF, he can now raise responder's first suit with 3 card support.

Responder does not have good stoppers in the 4th suit, and is hoping opener will bid NT with astopper. Responder is interested in slam in one of opener's suit. He wants to establish a game forcing auction, and will then raise one of opener's suits (more often the second suit) with his next bid.

                                                 
                                           Please click   ^$40  box below at the bottom of the page.   |

^d@e@2Responder has a good six card suit of his own with game forcing values. If he simply @E@3repeats his suit, opener can pass. By bidding 4th suit forcing and then bidding his suit, he can describe his hand and make sure the partnership gets to game.

Note that there is one other important implication if you play 4SF. If opener bids a suit, responder bids another suit, opener bids a third suit, and responder jumps in his original suit, that is no longer game forcing (although it is highly invitational). If responder had a game forcing hand, he would bid 4SF and then rebid his suit, So by failing to do so, he is showing an invitational hand with a long suit.

You may be concerned about hands where responder actually has the fourth suit, and be worried about missing a fit in that suit. However, that is not really a problem. First of all, it is fairly unlikely, because opener has already shown 2 suits, and it is unlikely he has good support for a third suit (unless he is 5-4-4 or 4-4-4-1). Second of all, opener is allowed to raise the fourth suit with 4 card support.

^B@2hondo717: Let us discuss this auction a bit. deb's overcall is a bit aggressive, particularly vul, but let us accept it for the sake of argument although I don't think she will do it again. However, now you need to decide whether terry's 2@D bid is forcing. I play even if I am an overcaller, a new suit by my partner is forcing. So I would take terry's bid as forcing. Having said that, I think terry should just bid 2@S. Redouble is another possibility which shows a good hand, which terry has, with 10 HCP.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |

^B@2hondo717: On the other hand, if terry passes, I would bid 1N, and we might end up in some number of NT. But I think terry should make a bid, either redouble or 2@S.|

The British called the document treasonous and the signatories traitors – singing it was an act punishable by death. Some signers lost their home in the ensuing Revolutionary War. Others were left without their livelihood. All had put their lives on the line.

The Declaration wasn’t just a blueprint for revolution; it helped to secure the future of the United States and became the mission statement for world democracy. We’re all familiar with the famous signers of the Declaration. Here, as a weekly series we will tell you about some of the lesser-known, ordinary heroes who declared our nation’s future.

^B@2hondo717: Pretty normal result.  Let us first review the bidding. I would have bid Stayman with dot's hand, because of the doubleton diamond. However, with 12 HCP it is likely 3N will make as well. dot told me that she  was just going on points which is fine with me. I also would have opened with dot's hand. by rule of 20, she has an opener, 12 HCP + 8 clubs/spades. |

You are allowed dot. Just mentioning what I would do. Also, the reason I mentioned the doubleton diamond is that it is likely 4S will score an extra trick or 2 due to diamond ruffs.|

hondo717: As to the play, kia took an interesting line in the spade suit. It happened to work because of the way the honors were situated. If kia had the 9, his play would be very good, because it works if I have either the K or J. However, missing the 9, I would play low to the Ace and low back towards the Q10, hoping an honor pops up from terry, or he hesitates with the K. I am not sure I would have got the spade suit right if I were declarer, but that's what I would do. |

^B@2hondo717: This is an easy hand for me. I have 1 spade loser, and possibly one club loser. that's it.|

Pear: If my hearts had been stronger I would have bid clubs ... is that correct?|
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Well, that is one criteria. If your J of spades had been with your diamonds, you might bid 3@C as well, because AJ together is better than a J by itself. Basically, if you have a "good" 9 points, you bid 3@C. you have an ordinary 9 points, so 3@D was fine.|

^B@2hondo717: Let us go briefly over how you bid in 2 over 1 when you have support for partner's major. With 4 card support, you always make a raise.
You bid 3@H with 5-6 HCP, 3@D with 7-bad 9, 3@C with 9-11, and 2N with 12 or more. If you bid 1N, you are denying 4 hearts terry
With 3 card heart support, with 6-9 you bid 2@H. With 10-11 you bid 1N forcing and then jump to 3@H over my bid. Bidding 1N forcing and jumping in hearts specifically shows 3 card support and 10-11. And with a game forcing hand and 3 card support you bid 2 over 1 first.|

nome: I decided not overcall with that poor spades holding.
hondo717: not vul, some experts would bid 1@S with your hand kia, but pass was fine. The singleton heart is valuable when I bid hearts. If it was a singleton somewhere else, there would be no case to bid 1@S.|
