^d @e@2In this presentation "nome" combined the movie of the hands from Howard's   @E@3recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log transcript.  

The goal here is presenting to you Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. Clicking the first will move you forward and clicking the second will take you back. When available there is an explanation for the bid in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. 

All the links in this presentation are clickable - it changes color when you roll your cursor over it. Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site. At the end of most boards, if not all, the viewer would be able to play the hand double dummy or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.

@D@DPlease note that this is a recreation of the mentoring sessions where for teaching purpose unlike the live play you can view all four hands.@D@D|fp||at|




                    Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

hondo717: You did about as well as you could kia. terry's double was takeout. However, because deb had such good hearts, and no other really good suit, pass was reasonable by her, although slightly risky. She knows terry must have a pretty good hand, because kia passed my 2H bid, so he and I cant have too many points, leaving more for terry. If kia and I were vulnerable, the pass would even be more clear cut, because down 2 would be a very good result, and even down 1 is pretty good. Down 2 is 500 and down 1 is 200, both probably better than anything terry and deb can make. In this hand, deb is always entitled to 3 trumps. The double was fine, although with such good spades, terry could make a case that he could bid 2@S. Either bid is acceptable. |

hondo717: Nothing to upgrade. 18 + 8 is more than enough for game. The Q of diamonds is worth its full 2 points, but the singleton is not worth much. Therefore, we are either going to end up in 3N or 4 hearts.|

NT|
hondo717: You made a slight error in the play kia, although it worked out the same. After drawing trump, get to the board and lead a low diamond. even if it loses, you can pitch your 4th club on the K of diamonds. And if it happens to win, and you get a 3-3 club break, you would ake 6. By knocking out ace of diamonds, before playing clubs and setting up deb's last club you guarantee five.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: As far as the bidding goes, once I bid 2N, that is pretty much a game force. The only question left is whether we should play in hearts or NT. There was no need to "upgrade" your hand. I am showing 18 or 19 and you have 8, so we have more than enough for game. |
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT|
In NT, you can always count the Q. My general rule is with honors in a short suit, I count the HCP for the honor, but not the shortness. so Q of diamonds is worth 2, but not also 2 for the singleton. In response to a question by kia I would like to discuss my 2NT bid and why even I could have 4 card @S and still bid 2NT. |
PG| ***** 43 ***** |

^d@e@21) While it is true that the bidding sequence 1@D-1@H-1N denies 4 spades, that is not @E@3true of the bidding sequence 1@D-1@H-2N. The feeling is it is more important to show the balanced nature and point count (18-19) in your hand. Since that sequence is forcing to game, there is no danger of your missing a 4-4 spade fit, as you can bid 3@C, NMF, to discover the spade fit. The sequence 1@D-1@H-1@S shows a minimum to medium opening hand with 4 spades. With a stronger balanced hand, you bid 2N, as in the example hand. With an unbalanced strong hand, you would bid 2@S.

2) On the same hand, once you bid 3@C, that is NMF. That asks opener to describe his major suit holdings. So if opener bids 3@H, he is showing 3 card heart support (with 4 hearts, he would have bid 4 hearts over 1@H, not 2N). If opener bids 3@S, he is showing 4 spades. With neither he bids 3N. Now let us go back to the next board.

nome: Another singleton?|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Perhaps.  deb has at least 5, and I have 5 and you have one, so terry has one or two. So, what is your plan?. You should draw 2 rounds of trump by playing 8 of spades first, ending in dummy, then play the heart. If terry ruffs, that is a natural trump trick anyway.|

hondo717: Well done terry. Now, a few points about this hand. Nothing egregious was done on this hand, but it should be down 1. First of all my double was takeout. The basic rule is that opener's double is takeout as long as there are 2 remaining unbid suits, and responder has not yet bid. The reason I doubled is that it is rarely right to let them play at the one level. As to the play of the hand, terry, since anne led the 2 of spades, she likely has 3 spades. You might as well take the finesse. most likely it will lose, but it will set up 2 spade tricks for you and every once in a while it might win. perhaps kia overcalled on j10xxx, you never know.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT|
And kia, you made a small defensive error that allowed terry to make it. When you got in with the K of spades, you should play the K of diamonds, so anne knows you have the Ace and K and then she can signal high with the 7 of diamonds. Of course, anne might still signal high, because she has a diamond trick after you knock out terry's supposed K, but playing the K makes it easy for her. This is just an example of how you need to card carefully on defense, because the smallest mistake can cost you.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


AT|
I led the ace and expected anne to drop the @DQ if she had it. So I thought that the opponents have it when I could not see the Q and did not play the J. Now I understand that was an error. |
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT|In the middle of the hand, when you have the A and K and play the suit, you should play the K, as it makes it clearer you have the A. If you play the Ace, partner has no way of knowing if you have the K. In the old days, we used to lead K from AK on opening lead (instead of the modern way of leading the A), which made things less confusing. However, you lead A from AK only on opening lead, otherwise K from AK. If you had led the K, anne should signal with the 7, since she knows you must have the Ace (since she has the Q, you must have the A). Even when you lead the A, anne should signal the 7, because even if declarer had the K, it would be good for you to continue the suit, to knock out declarer's K and set up Anne's Q. However, had you started with the K, it would have been even more obvious. |

^d@e@2Whether aristocrat, lawyer, farmer, or shopkeeper fiftysix ordinary men achieved something extra- @E@3ordinary when the Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776. The British called the document treasonous and the signatories traitors  singing it was an act punishable by death. Some signers lost their home in the ensuing Revolutionary War. Others were left without their livelihood. All had put their lives on the line.

The Declaration wasnt just a blueprint for revolution; it helped to secure the future of the United States and became the mission statement for world democracy. Were all familiar with the famous signers of the Declaration. Here, as a weekly series we will tell you about some of the lesser-known, ordinary heroes who declared our nations future. This week we have two more. |cp|8|FP|2|at|

hondo717: Let me discuss the auction. 1@D and 1@S are both standard.  brian has a problem, and 3 flawed choices over 1@S. 2@D is certainly reasonable, although he would like a better and longer suit. He could also bid 2@H, but that would be a reverse, and also he doesnt quite have enough points plus the singleton spade is bad. And finally, he could bid 1N, although again the singleton spade makes that flawed. So, all in all, I think 2@D was best. You would prefer to have 6, or at least a good 5 card suit, but sometimes you do not. Some kibs asked why I did not rebid spades. The reason was, I had a fairly min hand, and we had a diamond fit, and little prospect for game, so I thought pass was best.|

hondo717: A brief comment on the opening lead. I tend to consider the J and honor, so I would have led the 5 of hearts as 4th best. also helps give pard count. The 7 of hearts is not unreasonable either.|

hondo717: I am not sure I would have bid it myself. Also, the reason I opened 3@D instead of 4, even with an 8 card suit, is I wanted to make it harder for them to find their major suit game. If I bid 4, I may very well talk them into a making 4@H, whereas if I bid 3, they might stop at 3. |

hondo717: For the lead, you always lead top of an honor sequence, so J from J109 or J108, Q from QJ10 or QJ9. In this case the correct opening lead was the J. It also gives partner an instant picture of your heart holding.|

hondo717: Now, let me discuss pam's comment. Many people play what is known as "coded 10s and 9s." That means, you lead the 10 or 9 from either the top of a sequence, or from a broken sequence. So you would lead the 10 from AJ10xx or KJ10xx (still lead the Q from QJ10xx.) You would also lead the 10 from 109xx and the J from J10x. When playing coded 10s, the 10, shows either a broken sequence or the top of nothing, whereas the J shows nothing higher. That is where the phrase "Jack denies" comes from. If you play coded 10s and 9s, the J absolutely denies any higher card.|

NT|hondo717: Both pam and I were a tad aggressive on that hand.  6-4 hands are very powerful, and worth more points than they look like. You could even make a case that I can bid 3 spades with my hand. However, both pam and I have a flaw, singletons in each others suit. If I, for example, had a singleton club instead of diamond, hand would have made and pam should be worried about her heart singleton, and the value of her Q of clubs. However, I don't think either of us made awful decisions. they just did not work out.|

IraCT: Do you recommend; long suit, short suit, or help suit game try?|
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Once we have agreed on a suit, as we did on this hand, I recommend what are called help suit game tries. A new suit by responder, in this case, says, "pard I would like to invite to game" if you have a max for your bid, or an honor in the suit I just bid, then you should bid game. In this case, I felt my 6-4 hand was powerful enough to bid game, although it did not work out. The defense also did very well, taking the diamond and clubs right away.|

hondo717: Well done pam. That was pretty easy hand to bid and play. But let me talk about how to bid over an inverted raise. Basically, my 2C bid shows what I said, at least 10 HCP, no other 4 card suit, not even diamonds. So our goal is to see if we should be in 3N or a club game or a club partial. pams first obligation is to bid those suits in which she has a stopper, or if she has stoppers in all suits, she can bid 2N, as she did. The only issue is that my bid is not game forcing, but I am obligated to bid again as long as pam keeps bidding new suits. So if pam has 16 or more points, but is unsure about stoppers in one suit, she knows we should be in game, but keeps bidding suits trying to get me to bid NT, which she will raise to 3 if necessary. |

hondo717:2@D by brian shows a weak hand with long diamonds. With a stronger hand, he would bid 2D directly. And darlene, if you want to be aggressive, you can venture 2@S, since you passed originally you don't have much, and your singleton diamond is valuable. Do you want an undo darlene? or are you comfortable passing? |

hondo717: Since you did not support my suit, you must lead low, so I know you have 3. It is important when leading pards suit to give me count if you did not support. Had you supported, you can lead high from 3 small. However, generally speaking you should lead low from 3 to an honor, and I consider the J a honor.|

hondo717: well, as it turns out we make 2 or 3 spades, so 2@S might work out ok. You should not bid 2@S right away for sure, because you are too weak. However, once brian bids 2@D, your hand got a bit stronger, because of the singleton diamond, so 2@S, although aggressive is not terrible. I know you have less than 6 points, because you did not bid 2@S over the negative double. But vulnerable, 2@S is a rather scary bid, so pass is ok too.|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


NT|
Now, Next, let us discuss brian's auction. If you make a negative double, and then bid a new suit, that shows a weakish hand. Because brian had the opportunity to bid 2@D over 1@S, but made a negative double. Since he did not bid 2@D right away, his hand can't be that good, so now when he bids 2@D, it must show a weak hand with a long diamond suit and 4 hearts.|
