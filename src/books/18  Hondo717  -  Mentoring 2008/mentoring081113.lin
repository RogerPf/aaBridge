NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|OK, now both the declarer and defenders would have done better had they paid better attention to the auction. One of the most common mistakes made by less experienced players during the play of the hand is to forget about the auction. You should always use the auction to provide you clues on how to play the hand. dee should count her tricks. She can count 5 hearts and 2 clubs for sure, assuming she believes roberta's 2 club bid  and she also knows kia is out of clubs. As dee has eight clubs between her and dummy, and roberta presumably has 5 for her overcall, that leaves none for kia.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at| 
hondo717: |cp||at|So, when dee plays her club at trick three,assuming she pulled trumps, she should finesse. Now, let us switch over to roberta. Once roberta gets in with her K of clubs at trick 7 she can count 5 tricks for sure for the defense, the 3 spades they already took, plus the K of clubs. The lead was fine roberta. It was the play at the end that could have been different. My point was, when roberta gets in with the K of clubs, that is the 4th trick for the defense. 2 spades, ruff, a club and ace of diamonds is fifth trick. In order to beat the hand roberta simply leads the 9 of clubs to dummy, and waits for her 2 diamond tricks.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Now, let me address whether dee should cue bid. There are two problems with a cue bid. First, dee only has 3 card support. I prefer that cue bids show 4 card support, although many people play you can cue bid with 3.  The second reason is dee's points are in clubs and roberta bid clubs. Therefore, I must be short in clubs, meaning the club length and cards are not a good fit with me. So I like 2@H rather than 3@C cue bid. And, as it turns out, we have trouble making 2@H as it is. With 3 trumps I bid a new suit and then raise after. Sometimes you cant do that, so you lie and cue bid with 3 card support.|

NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|An interesting hand. First of all, I like kia's 3@D bid which shows a strong 2 suiter, which is what he has. roberta with her A of hearts and K of diamonds should seriously consider bidding 4@H. This is a case where her hand goes up a great deal in value based on the bidding. If her ace and king were in the black suits, her hand is not nearly as valuable. Remember, honors in your partner's suit generally have more value than honors in the opponents suits. That is because honors work better when they are in combination with other honors.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at| 
hondo717: |cp||at|On the play of the hand, as it was defended kia can make 4. He simply draws 4 rounds of trump, gets to dummy with the K of diamonds, and pitches his K of clubs on the spade. So he loses 2 spades and a diamond. That brings up another common defensive position that you should all know about. dee should play a 3rd round of spades, so that I trump the 10 of spades, depriving kia of a pitch.  This position comes up a lot. you cash one or two rounds of a suit setting up a card for the declaring side. However, when both your partner and declarer are out you should play a 3rd round to take away the winner from dummy, in this case the 10 of spades.|

hondo717: |cp||at|I play 2@D is the usual response to 2@C opening. Any suit other than 2 diamonds shows a 5+ card suit with 2 of the top 3 honors. Some play 2@H as bust, denying any aces and kings, in which case 2NT is used to show hearts, but the idea is the same.|

NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|The bidding was fine, especially kia's 3@C bid. Against proper defense, you are always down 1 roberta, but you could have made it because dee made a small slip. First, let me finish about the bidding. kia's 3@C bid was good, because it suggests a lead, and with such a good suit, is unlikely to get doubled. Now, as to how it can make the way it was defended. If you ruff the 3rd club high. play a heart to the 10 and take the spade finesse as you did, that is fine. It turns out, by ruffing a heart high, you have 2 entries to the board.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at| 
hondo717: |cp||at|Further, because dee pitched a spade at trick three, you can throw 2 diamonds, one on the J of spades and one on the 6. So the mistake dee made was not keeping "parity" with dummy. That means, you try to keep same length as dummy in 4+ cards suit. In this case dee needs to keep 4 spades because dummy has 4 spades. otherwise, dummy's low spade sets up.|

NT|^B@2|cp|8|at| 
hondo717: |cp||at|Now, this hand had some interesting bidding concepts. Most experts these days advocate any balanced 15-17 HCP hand 1NT, even with a 5 card major. The reason being, otherwise it is hard to describe the strength any other way. So, I like dee's 1N opener, even though her clubs are suspect. I also think her 3H bid was quite good. That must show a 5 card heart suit. As it turns out, either 3N or 4@H are equivalent contracts which is often the case, even if 1N opener has a 5 card major.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |

nome: I am in dark in why play in suit rather than in NT. |
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Well, once you invite kia, dee can now give you a choice of games. Her 3@H bid says I want to bid game, but I have 5 hearts.  If you have 3 hearts and a suitable hand, you can bid 4@H. and with your singleton spade, 4@H makes sense. That is a very unusual auction, but I congratulate dee on her imaginative bid.|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|In opening 1NT with five card major, I don't tend to differentiate, but I suppose if you have AKQxx in your major, that makes one of a major more compelling. Although those points are likely to be just as useful in NT.  So, I just advocate opening 1N with any 15-17 balanced hand. but if you prefer opening one of a major with a strong major, I see nothing terrible about that. just a matter of  personal preference.|

hondo717: |cp||at|Very nicely played kia. You forgot that the club ten was good and you could make five. Keeping track of all cards is very important. But, still well played. Further, this was a problem hand for north to bid. We missed our spade fit. As North, I would have liked to cue bid 2D, allowing kia to show which major he had, but I am not quite strong enough, given roberta opened 1@D. If she had opened 1@C, then my diamond points are more valuable (again, notice how the value of your hand changes based on the auction), and then I would have cue bid 2@C, showing an  opening hand.|

NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|We need to decide what we are playing over weak NT. I suggest either DONT or natural. I know some of you like Brozel.  My problem with Brozel is you cannot always compete at the 2 level with a 2 suited hand not containing hearts. I will discuss Brozel after the hand. I do not like Cappelletti either. Although many people play that over the weak NT. The reason is that you often have to go to the 3 level to find the best spot to play. For example, if you bid 2@H in Cappelletti, showing hearts and a minor, you have to go to the 3 level to play in the minor.|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Let me just briefly go over Brozel, as that is another system that some use to compete over NT. It is similar in some ways to DONT, except it revolves around the heart suit. In Brozel, as with DONT, double is a single suited.  2@C shows clubs and hearts, 2@D shows diamonds and hearts, and 2@H shows hearts and spades.  2@S shows spades and a minor, and 2N shows both minors. So Brozel works well if you have hearts, in that, unlike DONT, partner always knows what 2 suits you have. However, DONT keeps you at a lower level if one of your 2 suits is not hearts.|

camilleln: Yes.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


cp|8|at|  hondo717: |cp||at|OK, we will go over full leb later. But, I like one modification to Lebensohl. In standard Lebensohl, here if ally doubles 2@H that is a penalty double. That means ally cannot compete with a balanced moderate hand, such as the one she has now. And balanced moderate hands come up more often than penalty doubles. So, I like to play a double by ally is "competitive". It shows 8-10 or so, and no 5 card suit, willing to pass whatever Ira bids. Here, ally has a pretty good competitive double with her hand, and that is the bid I would make.|

hondo717: |cp||at|I like to address defense first. At trick one, Ira decided to lead the ace of diamonds, not my choice, as I really dislike leading aces, but it worked out ok since ally had good diamonds. Ira has no real good lead. However, he could lead spades. Trumps are always possible leads, especially when you feel there might be ruffs on the hand, as in this case. I would have led a trump, South is probably short in hearts and you want to cut down on ruffs. However, the bigger problem was ally's heart return at trick three. I think a trump or diamond by her would have been better.|

hondo717: |cp||at|Lots to talk about. First of all, let us say Ira's bid was "imaginative", lol. He is a bit weak to compete over the weak NT. We are playing DONT, so the double shows a single suited hand. I basically advocate competing with sound hands in first or second seat over the weak NT, especially if vul. Next, let us discuss the |cp|8|at|"dont runout" |cp||at|system over DONT double.|
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|The "dont runout" system works as follows:
If pam redoubles, she is showing a single suited hand;
if pam bids a suit, it shows a 2 suited hand, DONT style, that is the suit bid plus a higher ranking suit. So 2@C by pam shows clubs and some other suit, 2@D by pam shows diamonds and a major, and 2@H by pam shows hearts and spades. On this hand, she could bid either 2@C or 2@D, but it is rare you have a 3 suited hand.|

hondo717: |cp||at|I think the defense needs some discussion. The spade lead was fine, although I tend to favor not leading doubletons unless there is no better choice. My choice would have been the J of clubs. In this case the spade lead was fine as ally guessed spade was pam's suit. But, in general, unless it is pard's suit, leading doubletons should be avoided if you have another choice. |
PG| ***** 176 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Now, to the trick two and three. When I played a club of dummy, you should play low pam. Basically, develop the habit of playing 2nd hand low. That should be your first instinct. You have to have a very good reason to play 2nd hand high. And, then cashing the K of spades is probably not right. There is only one spade remaining, if I had a doubleton, I might very well have played low. The K of spades is probably not going away.|
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|One of the hardest things to learn on defense is patience. Don't cash your tricks or play 2nd hand high unless you think there is a good chance they are going away. Your instinct should be to have patience. capture their honors with your honors. In this hand, if I had another spade, your spade is always good, unless you think I am throwing it away somewhere.|

^C@2nome: As added emphasis on Howard's teaching I have decided each week to collect many of his important @E@3instructions in one page under "Howard's Pearls" which we can go over them many times. The following are my picks. I am sure you will find many more.|FP|2|cp|8|at|

^C@2** |FP||cp||at|Honors in your partner's suit generally have more value than honors in the opponents suits. That is because honors work better when they are in combination with other honors. |FP|2|cp|8|at|
 
** |FP||cp||at|1N is not forcing over 1 of a minor,  and 1N is no longer forcing if the opponents interfere. |FP|2|cp|8|at|
 
** |FP||cp||at|Inverted minors do not apply once there is interference. |FP|2|cp|8|at|

** |FP||cp||at|If you double and "correct" to 1N, that shows a strong hand, just like doubling and correcting in a suit. That shows a hand stronger than a 1N overcall. |FP|2|cp|8|at|

** |FP||cp||at|"Bid early - bid often", is my style. |FP|2|cp|8|at|

^D @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.  

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N|
