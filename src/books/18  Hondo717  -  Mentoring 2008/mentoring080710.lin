^*Bhondo717:^*N first, well played moe. Second, a few interesting points with the auction. Technically, by rule of 20, aggie can open 1@S, but, as I mentioned, with such few high card points, probably tactically better if she opens 2@S. Next, we should look at kia's bid. there is still some confusion over when to make a takeout double.  If you can overcall in a major, you almost always should do so, unless you have a really strong hand, enough to double and correct. In general, you want to get across the fact that you have 5+ cards in a major ASAP. So, a better bid by kia is 2@H, even though technically he has support for all suits|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT|^B@2
nome: I felt the @H suit was poor for an overcall.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


AT| 
^*Bhondo717:^*N Well, if you only had 5 hearts to the K, you have a point, but with a six card suit, the extra length gives you extra power against being doubled. But I see where you might be confused. Particularly in a competitive auction, if you can get across that you have a long major, you should do so. Even with a good 5 card minor, it is often better to bid the suit than double, because it makes it easier for pard to compete.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Now, let us look at moe's response. In one sense, he has a bad hand, because he has spades and aggie opened them.  On the other hand, he does have solid spades and very good diamonds and 10 points. So 2@D is technically an underbid, since, you may recall from last week, you are supposed to jump with 10 points in response to a takeout double. Believe it or not, I might bid 2N with his hand, even though it is unbalanced,  hoping Kia has the clubs and hearts covered. because if so, and if Kia  has one diamond honor, 3N is a good bet. That bid comes more from experience, is not obvious at all.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|^B@2
pzee: How could they get to 5@d?.         delcod1: Could Kia advance Moe's @ds? |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717:^*N To answer both questions, moe should probably bid at least 3@D, that is more likely to get them to 5@D or 3N.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


AT|
moedraznin: I discounted my hand since I know Aggie has 5@s and really 6@S from earlier discussion.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


AT| 
^*Bhondo717:^*N Well, normally you would be right moe, but you do have 4 sure spade tricks. You don't fit well with kia, but it almost doesn't matter.  As I said, that hand is very unusual, so it is hard to bid.|

NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N I guess the theme of the evening is to give moe hard hands to bid, lol. He has 19 points, and kia is showing at least 6 or so. Therefore, moe should let kia know that they should be in game. His 2 choices are to jump shift, or to bid 3NT. Occasionally, if you choose to jump shift, you are forced to jump shift into a 3 card minor, so if moe chose to jump shift, 3@C would have to be his bid. In this case, since moe has points in all the suits, 3N is probably his best bid. Not sure it makes, but it has plays. The point here is moe must produce a game forcing auction, and he did not.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT|^B@2
jlco: Doesn't his bid of 3@S invite game?|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717:^*N To answer jlco's question, his 3@S bid shows an invitational hand (good 15 to bad 18), and a good six card suit. kia may pass with anything less than a good eight points. So, moe's 3@S bid has two problems. First, his spade suit is not good enough. And 2nd, he has too many points. But, as I said, his hand is hard to bid.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT|^B@2
dee_dee_20: I would take 3@s as 18-19  3 level bid no interference.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717:^*N Well dee, the usual meaning of 3@S is an invitational hand that may be passed by responder. With 18 or 19, moe must do something else. jump shift, bid 3N, or bid 4@S. However, 3@S worked out on this hand as it turns out, but just because it did, does not mean it was the best bid.|

PF|Y|NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N OK, first let us discuss the opening bid. One question that was asked was, what does a 3N opening bid show?  A 3N opening bid used to show 25-27. However, not that you get 25-27 very often, but the modern way to show that hand is to open 2@C and rebid 3N as your 2nd bid. Thus, that leaves open a 3N opening bid. Many players play that as "gambling." So, if they have a solid running minor, and at least the likelihood of taking 8 tricks, they open 3N.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N The idea is they can take 9 tricks quickly, and get in the opponents way. Some people play it very disciplined, meaning gambling 3N shows exactly a solid 8 card minor, and no outside Aces or Kings. I tend to play it a bit looser (not a big surprise, lol) meaning it just shows an 8 or 9 trick hand with a solid 7 or 8 card minor.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N The other thing I want to discuss is "fast arrival" and the general bidding principle which it represent. It means, once you are in a game forcing auction, the faster you get to game, the worse your hand is. If your  hand is stronger, you want to leave more room to explore for slam, but if it is weaker, you just want to bid game.  On this hand, for example, once aggie opens 2@C, we are in a game force.  When she bids 2@S, and I have spades, I have 2 choices.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
** If I have a pretty good hand, say at least 7 points or so, I might want to look for slam and I want to leave as much room as possible. So I would bid 3@S. aggie cannot pass, as she knows we are in a game force.

** If I have spades and a weak hand, as I do here, I bid 4@S (fast arrival) to say I have no interest in slam.|

PF|Y|NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Nice try moe as we can make 4@H. But let me explain why kia should bid 5@D. He knows there is an 11 card fit, so by my rules of competitive bidding, it is ok to bid at the 5 level (number of trumps = safe contract level, 11 trumps = 5 level.)  Also, based on the auction, it is likely we have at least a 10 card fit, as I probably have 5+ hearts, so moe has one at most. The only time kia is wrong, is if we don't make 4 hearts and they cannot make 5 diamonds and, he might talk us into bidding 5@H, which might go down.|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N As to the play, it is probably down 1, losing a heart and 2 spades. However, there is one chance to make, if someone has the doubleton ace of spades. If I were declarer, I would hope aggie had the doubleton ace.  So, I would lead low towards the Q of spades, and then low back towards my hand, playing a low spade.  It doesn't work on this hand, but it is your best shot. |
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


NT|^B@2
emmee: could aggie bid 2NT instead of 2@H?|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


AT| 
^*Bhondo717:^*N aggie could bid 2N showing at least 5/5 in clubs and hearts. Except that does not apply here. 2N over a weak 2, shows a strong NT with diamonds stopped. The unusual NT only applies if there is a strong opener. Simply:
Over a 1@C opening, 2NT shows diamonds and hearts. 
Over a 1@D  opening, 2NT shows clubs and hearts. 
Over a 1@H or 1S opening, 2NT shows both minors. |

pg| ***** 90 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N First, let us discuss the auction. Many people play 4th suit forcing. That is a convention where, if at responder's 2nd bid, 3 suits have been bid, and responder bids the remaining (4th) suit, that is artificial and game forcing. So, if anna was playing that convention, a 2@D bid by her would not necessarily promise diamonds. It simply establishes a game forcing auction. Her next bid would clarify her hand. For example, if anna had a game forcing hand with 6 spades, she would bid 2@D and then spades at her next bid.|
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N That would tell her partner, the reason she bid 4th suit forcing was to show a game forcing hand with good spades. But, if anna bids 3@S right away over 2@C, that is not game forcing, although highly invitational.  So anna, you could consider bidding 3@S over 2@C. However, with your shortness in both of partner's suits, I think 2@S was a reasonable choice as well. I would want to bid 2.5 spades with your hand (actually 2.4, lol.)|
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


pc|D4|NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N A diamond is a reasonable lead terry, but you should consider a trump. I will explain why. betty has shown hearts and clubs, and support for spades. Therefore, it is likely she is short in diamonds. So, you might want to cut down ruffs in her hand by leading a trump. Not saying it is obvious, but should be considered.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N Nicely played. Now let us discuss when you should lead trumps. If the hand that ends up as dummy has bid several suits, and delays support of declarer's suit, then it is likely dummy is short in the unbid suits and a trump lead should be considered. On this board, based on the auction, betty's likely distribution is 3-5-1-4.  Because she bid hearts (promising 5), then clubs (promising 4), and then raised spades (probably showing 3.) Thus, the  auction was quite informative to the defense, and called for a trump lead, to prevent anna from trumping her diamond losers.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N A few points on auction. Some people would bid 2@H with my hand early on, especially at this vulnerability. And, given we have at least a 9 card fit, it is not dangerous, in the sense that we won't go down much if at all. However, I have fewer points than I promise. 2@H promises at least 4 points, and I only have 3. Further, the K of clubs is not well positioned, given anna opened 1@C. So I felt pass is best.|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N however, once the auction died at 1@S, because I passed originally, I have no problem bidding 2@H, because terry knows I cant have 6 points. One good principle to follow is, if you take a slight underbid as responder's first bid, you can bid the heck out of the cards afterwards :).|

^*Bhondo717:^*N So once again, I know terry is likely to be 1-3-4-5, similar to the previous hand. He showed 5 clubs, 4 diamonds, and likely 3 hearts so a trump lead is to be considered. My only problem with a trump lead is a singleton trump often gives away a trick. However, in this case I will hope that if it does, the extra spade tricks make up for it. But, in general, be wary of leading a singleton trump.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N Since I chose a trump, you should take the K of hearts and play another trump. Once partner chooses a defense, in general try to stick with it, unless it is obviously wrong.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N Well, let me  briefly review reverses. If you |CP|8|AT|voluntary|CP||AT| bid past your first suit at the 2 level, that is known as a reverse. A reverse is used to show a strong hand, 15+ points, and is unlimited (can be up to a 2@C opener.)  Also, when you reverse, the first suit you bid must be longer than the 2nd suit. If partner reverses, the partnership is forced to at least the 2N level. In this hand, therefore,  betty can bid 2@H and know that terry is not allowed to pass. And since betty has 10 points, she also is in charge of making sure they get to game, as terry can pass below game with only 15 or 16.|
PG| ***** 140 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Reverses are not alertable. they are part of standard bidding, although are very misunderstood. It is only alertable if a reverse does not promise extra values because playing it as not forcing is not standard. Here, if betty had 10 points and a different sort of hand, she could bid 2@S, which is 4th suit forcing, establishing a game force.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N So despite the bad breaks, terry made 4. Let us discuss terry's options after the 2@S raise. If he has a minimum hand (up to 14), he should pass, as there is no chance for game. If he has a medium hand, good 15-17, he should either bid 3@S, or bid a new suit, inviting game in spades. And if he has a very good opening hand, 18+, he should just bid 4. The basic idea is that you should try to get to game if there is any possibility that it makes.|

lcmdir: what about stiff K@H?|
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Well, it is hard to know how to count the singleton K of hearts. I use shortness points myself, 3 for a void, 2 for a singleton, one for a doubleton, when evaluating my hand. However, when I have a singleton honor, I either count the honor or the singleton, whichever is higher. In this case, I count the K of hearts as 3, but do not add 2 points for the singleton as well. If terry, for example, had the singleton J of hearts, I would count 2 for the singleton, and nothing for the J.|
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N That seems to work out as well as anything. Points are a good guideline, but judgement is very important as well. Which is why I try to emphasize how the value of your hand changes based on the auction.|

PG| ***** 176 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N There are some positives to your hand. You have more points than you promised, as you can balance with as little as 8 or  and your singleton heart is terrific. You might want to consider if we can play in 3N, since your hand is worth 6 tricks (5 clubs and a spade.) However, you have no heart stopper. So, you might consider bidding 3@S. If I happen to raise to 4@S, you can always go back to clubs. And 3@S lets me bid 3N, and shows you have a good hand.|
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


mb|3S|mb|p|mb|5C|NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Now, from my perspective, betty has shown extra values by bidding 3@S, and she is likely short of hearts. I don't want to bid 3N, as my heart stopper is tenuous at best, but I have a great hand otherwise. So I will stretch a bit and bid 5@C.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N Well played. This hand was a good illustration of how you need to reevaluate your hand in the context of the auction. On some auctions, betty has a so-so hand. For example, if I had bid hearts, that would be bad. However, on this auction, she has a very good hand and it kept getting better.|

analisals: could your 2 heart bid be construed as a Western cue bid as well as a limit raise ?|
PG| ***** 195 ***** |

^*Bhondo717:^*N Good question lisa. betty should bid 2N with a heart stopper, so in a sense you are correct.|
PG| ***** 196 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
^*Bhondo717:^*N Now, to get back to why betty's hand got better. Once I raised clubs (by bidding 2@H), that improves her hand. And once terry bids 3@H, that improves it some more, as it is less likely I have too many wasted heart points. So, over terry's 3@H bid, she should want to take a bid, but she is not sure either how high or what strain -NT or clubs. Therefore, 3@S sort of keeps our options open. An expert partner would understand that 3@S does not necessarily show a spade suit, just spade values.|
PG| ***** 197 ***** |


NT|^B@2
bhr: I started to bid 4@C.|
PG| ***** 198 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717:^*N 4@C would be good too. 3@S is only a bit better because it lets us get to 3N (although that is an unlikely contract.)  The fact that you wanted to bid was the key, what you bid was not quite as important. Now, let me answer questions about I opening 1NT. I do have enough points to overcall 1N, and some people might. But, I have very weak majors, including kind of a tentative heart stopper, so I thought pass was better. However, I would not fault someone for overcalling 1N.|

Basically, it says, as responder, you are usually the "captain" of the auction. That means, responder is responsible for figuring out the final contract. Responder can elicit information from opener, but has the final responsibility for determining the contract.|

NT|^B@2
But, most of the time, the responder is captain. In this case, betty knows we have game once I open. Now, the only question is, which game and that becomes obvious once I show spades by doubling 2@S. So she can just bid 4@S.  If you know what the final contract should be, bid it. That avoids any unforeseen disasters.|
