NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|OK, we talked about the bidding, now we need to discuss the play particularly at the end. judy was  a bit aggressive, but it turns out the hand can be made.  klaus made a slight error when he covered the 9 of spades, and once he does that, you have a glimmer of hope pam. You need to win the trump return on the board, and lead a low spade and finesse the 8. Of course, that means you have to keep track of all the spots down to the 8, which I know is hard.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|If you do that, because spades are 3-3 and I have the 10, you can make the hand. The real lesson here is, when one line fails, don't give up. try to find an alternative. Some of you who watch me play see me make some difficult hands, because I always am an optimist :).|

PF|Y|NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|First the bidding.  This is a case where my hand got more valuable as the auction proceeded. Once klaus raises spades, I know we have a 9 card fit. and once judy rebids diamonds, that makes my singelton diamond even more valuable. So even though my hand only has 12 HCP, it is really "worth" about 17 or so. For those of you who know about losing trick count,  I have a six loser hand (2 spades, 1 heart, 2 clubs, 1 diamond), which is the equivalent of about 16 points.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|And the 10s add some extra value to the hand as well. So, if I have a good fit with klaus, we have a shot at game. The point is, when in a competitive auction, if you have extra values, don't just rebid your suit if there are other bids available, and you have more than a minimum. Once I bid 3@H, his hand gets a lot better as well, and 4@S is the correct bid, whether or not it makes.|

hondo717: |cp||at|Do you know about 4th Suit Forcing judy?|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


AT|
joyablE: I would like to learn. |
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


mb|2S|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Good. Now, my 2@S is Fourth Suit Forcing. It says nothing about spades. It just establishes a game force. Responder's next bid will clarify why he bid 4SF. In this hand you have pretty much denied spades and there is no point in my bidding it. However, I am bidding it to establish a game force and my next bid will clarify why I bid it.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


mb|p|NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Here you should bid 3@C which is just showing 5+ clubs and denying 3 card heart support.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


mb|3C|mb|p|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|I am intending to bid 3@D over judy's 3@C. 3@D is describing why responder bid 4th suit forcing. He is looking for a possible diamond slam.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


mb|3D|MB|P|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Now your hand got better judy, so you can bid either 4@D or 4@C. My 3@d is not invitation to game. It is forcing to game, and looking for slam. 5@D is actually weaker than 4@D. Just remember, we are forced to game.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Now, that is good news to you, since you have a powerful 6/5 hand with 2 pretty good suits.  So, you might bid 4 clubs, showing that you have a club control.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


MB|4C|MB|P|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Now, we are in a diamond auction. 4@C is just saying you have good clubs and, with my hand, I can just bid 4N, because if you have 2 key cards, I probably want to be in six.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


MB|4N|NT|^B@2
joyable: How do you know I have 2 key cards? |
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Once I bid 3@D we are in a diamond auction and diamonds are trumps. Therefore, the rest of  bids are just describing other features of the hand.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


MB|P|at|   joyable: So I bid 5 hearts, showing 2 key cards, you close with 6 diamonds.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Yes, and six diamonds has plays on this hand. It turns out it makes, possibly even 7 because both diamonds and spades behave.|

IraCT: But, I thought you respond differently to Blackwood with void.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|You do. I will discuss that in a minute. 

Fourth Suit Forcing is a very good convention.  To see a detailed discussion on 4th suit forcing, go to  ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/#2over1^*N and download Part1 - Game Forcing Auctions.  |

NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717; |cp||at|Now, let me summerized the entire auction.
1) First 3 bids are standard
2) 2@S is fourth suit forcing. It says nothing about spades. It just establishes a game force. Responder's next bid will clarify why he bid 4SF. 
3) 3@C is just showing 5+ clubs and denying 3 card heart support
4) 3@D is describing why responder bid 4th suit forcing. He is looking for a possible diamond slam.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|5) 4@C is showing that opener is also interested in a diamond slam, and showing a club control. The reason opener is interested in slam is that, despite only 12 HCP, his 2 suited hand is extremely powerful, probably worth about 19 points.
6) The rest of the auction is just standard RKCB.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


pf|y|NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|The other point on this hand is the  ways to show blackwood with a void.
1) A 5N response shows an even number of key cards (0, 2, or 4) and a void.
2) 6 of a suit shows an odd number of key cards (1 or 3) and a void in the suit bid. If the suit is above the trump suit (as in this case, where trumps are diamonds and the void is in hearts), then 6 of the trump suit shows a void in a higher ranking suit. (Had the void been in clubs, responder would bid 6 clubs).|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


PF|Y|NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Note that the void should be "useful", meaning that it is probably not in a suit where the RKCB bidder has shown cards. In this case, the heart void is probably not useful, since the RKCB bidder showed hearts, so on this hand, I would not bid 5N (showing 2 key cards and a void), but 5H (showing 2 key cards without the Q).|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |

@D@Dnome: Due to multiple technical problems the players could not play this hand. However, you can play it double dummy.|

NT|^B@2|CP|8|AT| 
hondo717: |CP||AT|We will discuss the auction in a while, but I think the play is important too. I think you forgot to plan the hand out at trick one angela. You should count out your winners and losers.  You have 1 spade loser, 1 diamond loser, ostensibly. However, the hand is a bit trickier than that, so you need to count your winners as well. You have 4 spade tricks, 3 clubs, 1 diamond, and 1 heart. Therefore, if you ruff 1 heart in dummy, you will come to 10 tricks, because you will score an extra trump trick.|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


NT|^B@2|CP|8|AT|
hondo717: |CP||AT|Basically, if you play ace of hearts and ruff a heart, you can then draw trumps and claim 10 tricks, losing a trump and 2 hearts. The diamond loser goes on the last club. It comes down to counting your winners and losers at trick one. You still can make it even with the heart finesse losing. The most important thing to learn from this hand is planning at trick one. if you can train yourself to do that, your declarer play will improve immensely.|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


NT|^B@2|CP|8|AT|
hondo717: |CP||AT|Now as to this 2 over 1 auction. The basic idea behind 2 over 1 is that if partner bids at the 2 level over one of a major, that is a game force. And, "fast arrival" is one of the important principles that arise from 2 over 1.  Fast arrival means that the faster responder bids game, once a game force is established, the weaker responder's hand is. You want to keep the bidding lower to explore for slam, but if you have a minimum game forcing hand, no need to go slow.  On this auction, had it gone 1@S-2@D-2@H-4@S, saylee would be showing a minimum opening hand with spade support and diamonds and little interest in slam.|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


NT|^B@2|CP|8|AT|
hondo717: |CP||AT|The auction 1@S-2@D-2@H-2@S is stronger. There is not general agreement as to 1@S-2@D-2@H-3@S.  I play that is pretty much a slam force, but others do not. So, with saylee's hand, I would have bid 2@S, not 3@S, showing some interest in slam. That auction shows saylee has around 16 points or so, which is exactly what west has. In any case, angela, with a minimum hand and little in the way of aces and kings, is not interested in slam, so would bid 4@S over 2@S. But, "fast arrival" is the important point to remember. If west forces to game and then makes minimum rebids, that shows slam interest if playing 2 over 1.|

PF|Y|NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|The only comment I have is about saylee's bidding. I like the opening bid, even with only 10 HCP, as the hand meets the rule of 20. Now over 1 spade, a case can be made for saylee to bid 2 spades. It  is ok to raise 1 spade to 2 spades with 3 card support, if you have shortness and honor 3rd in spades. So, based on that criteria, saylee could bid 2 spades. However, with a 7 card heart suit, on this particular hand, I think 2 hearts is a much better bid.|
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


NT|^B@2
gardener53: I think it merit 1@H opening because she only had 6 losers.|
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|gardner's observation is a good one, for those of you familiar with losing trick countnwithout getting into too much detail, saylee's hand contains "6 losers", 2 hearts, 2 spades, 1 diamond, and 1 club.  Since many opening bids contain 7 losers, a six loser hand is certainly an opening hand using the losing trick count criteria. So by both the rule of 20 and losing trick count, saylee has an opening hand.|

hondo717: |CP||AT|Well, they were a little lucky that 5 diamonds and 3NT both make, due to the 2-2 diamond break. Given moe's preempt, the odds do not favor a 2-2 break. But the preempt made it difficult for them to find either 5@d or 3NT. If kia were in direct seat, he should pass. However, in balancing seat, even with as little as 10 points, he should strongly consider balancing. aggie might consider bidding 3@S over 3@D, because kia could have a better hand and they have a 9 card diamond fit, so it is unlikely 4 diamonds will go down. |
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


NT|^B@2|CP|8|AT|
hondo717: |CP||AT|when balancing, kia is assuming you have 9 or 10 points, so you have little more than expected.  but, if kia has 14 or more, you would hate to miss game. and, as it was, you did miss game because of the 2-2 break.|

delcod1: If one of the honors in the other suit was there I would have in a minute.|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


CP|8|AT|
hondo717: |CP||AT|If one of the honors was in spades, you should overcall 3 spades to start with. Therefore,  by bidding 3 spades over 3@D, you are showing a good hand with so-so spades or else a not so good hand with good spades. In either case, you were not good enough to bid 3 spades directly, so your hand has to be flawed in some way. |
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


NT|^B@2|CP|8|AT|
hondo717: |CP||AT|When playing with reliable partners, you can get a lot of inferences by what they did not bid as well as what they did bid. You need to take that into account when evaluating the  auction. Here, kia might consider 3N over 3@S. With Axx of clubs, he can hold up enough times to make sure I don't have any clubs to lead back.  And if he can keep moe off lead, 3N should make. Anyway, here is an example where the preempt did its job.|

NT|^B@2|CP|8|AT|
hondo717: |CP||AT|Now, a few things to discuss. First my 3@S bid.  If partner opens a weak 2, and you have 3 card support, it is not dangerous for you to raise to 3, even with few points. Remember, you have a 9 card fit, and it is ok to compete to the 3 level with a 9 card fit. It is only a question of tactics. In this case, I might be afraid of pushing them into a makeable 4@h game, so pass might work out better than 3@S, not because 3@S is dangerous per se, but because it might get us a  bad result. kia probably would pass 3@H if I did not bid 3@s.|
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


NT|^B@2|CP|8|AT|
hondo717: |CP||AT|So there is a good example where I pushed them into game which it turns out it can be made. Now, let me discuss my opening lead. In general, as you know, I don't like to lead unprotected aces. However, leading away from my minor suit kings did not seem very good, and indeed, if I had, it would have cost us a trick.  I could have gone passive and led a trump. However, odds are moe has the K of spades, so in this case leading the ace should be ok more times than not. In this case, moe did not have the K, but it still did not cost me a trick.|
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


NT|^B@2|CP|8|AT|
hondo717: |CP||AT|On the other hand, a heart lead would have worked also. Now, let us see how aggie might plan the hand. She can count 1 spade loser, and 1 diamond loser, pretty much however the diamonds are sitting. Even if the diamond finesse works, as it does, she still has to lose a diamond, since she is missing the K and 10. If she is lucky, she only has 1 club loser, if moe has the K of clubs. |
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


NT|^B@2|CP|8|AT|
hondo717: |CP||AT|However, she has an additional chance. If clubs are 3-2, she can set up her clubs, and pitch her diamonds. So, she should ignore diamonds until last. She should draw trumps, and then play a club to the ace and a club back towards the K. If moe has the K, then the hand makes no matter what. If I have the K, and lead a diamond, she has to hope the K of diamonds is onside, and play a low diamond. By playing clubs first, she gives herself many extra chances to make the hand. So, the idea here is to maximize your odds.|

NT|^B@2|CP|8|AT|
hondo717: |CP||AT|First the bidding. To answer kia's question, your 2N was a bit risky, as I might make a negative double with as little as 8 points or so, or even less with a long major. However, with 18 points, you would bid 3N, not 2N. As to the play, you do have entry problems in setting up your diamonds. First, you should count your tricks. 3 clubs probably, 2 diamonds at least, and 4 diamonds if they break 3-3,  one heart at least, and no spades. So if only 2 diamonds, you need to take 2 more tricks somewhere. One possibility is an extra heart or two.|
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


NT|^B@2|CP|8|AT|
hondo717: |CP||AT|Your first play should be low towards the Q of diamonds. On good days aggie will have the K  and that way, you have another diamond to get back to your hand. Once diamonds are 3-3 you are home free. And if they aren't, then you need to hope kia has the K of hearts. The basic lesson, as usual, is to come up with a plan at trick one, by counting your winners and losers.|

^C@2nome: As added emphasis on Howard's teaching I have decided each week to collect many of his @E@3important instructions in one page under "Howard's Pearls" which we can go over them many times. The following are my picks. I am sure you will find many more.|fp|2|at|

**  When one line fails, don't give up. try to find an alternative. 

**  when in a competitive auction, if you have extra values, don't just rebid your suit if there are other bids available, and you have more than a minimum. 

**  The most important thing to learn is planning at trick one. if you can train yourself to do that, your declarer play will improve immensely.

^D @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.  

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N|
