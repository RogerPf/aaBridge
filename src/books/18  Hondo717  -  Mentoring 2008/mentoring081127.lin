^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You did well anne. You counted your tricks and took them :). From a teaching perspective, I have only a few comments -of course! 

First, anna with 5-card suit should consider bidding 2@S over 1N. That makes the bidding a bit more difficult for me. The other minor issue is anne should hold up one round in spades. It probably makes no difference, but if spades are 6-2, and clubs don't break, and the person with six spades doesn't have the ace of diamonds, you will make anyway.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|anne belongs to the hondo school of aggressive game bids :) However, let us discuss the bidding. I think there are a couple of chances for E/W to stop in 3. First, one could make a case that anne could make a takeout double over 1@H, although she is a smidgen weak. Therefore, with 4-3-3-3,  pass is fine. Double is a bit aggressive. But let us assume for the sake of argument that anne chooses a takeout double. If so, then anna should bid 2@S, which shows an invitational, but not game forcing hand.|

PG| ***** 32 ***** |


nt||cp|8|at|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other alternative is anne could pass, as she did. that is fine. anna has a very good balancing 1@S bid. Then, anne has a bit of a problem, because she is not sure how strong anna is. My recommendation is, over my 2@H bid, anne should bid 3@H, showing a limit raise in spades. |

pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, one other point about my bidding. I have several choices over the 1@S balance. I could double or I could bid 2@D, instead of 2@H. The reason I bid 2@H is my partner is a passed hand, and 2@H takes up the most room. I should really have six hearts to do that, but I felt the extra points and good heart quality made up for the lack of a sixth heart. So my bid was tactical as much as anything else. I would not fault anyone who doubled with my hand. I prefer that to 2@D. |

^m@2hondo717: |cp||at|Let me explain. Here with appropriate  @3hand if South bids, for example, 2@D over 2@C, that would be showing a limit raise in clubs as you see in the auction on the left.  The cue bid as limit raise only applies when you are responder to either an opener or an overcaller.  @2 |HT|e|cs|4|at|^b {|ia|1d2cp2d|at|}|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, anna can make a cue bid of 3@C to show a limit raise of diamonds, with the appropriate hand. However, once a new suit is introduced, the cue bids take on a different meaning. In that case, the cue bid is now asking about a diamond stopper. We have bid 2 suits, so, assuming you don't have hearts, there is a good chance we might want to play 3N. So, your 3@D bid says, "pard, I would like to play NT if you have a diamond stopper."  Some people call that a "western cue bid." In your particular case, you should simply bid 3@H over 2@H.  There is no real reason to have the cue bid show a limit raise in hearts. I already know you have a pretty good hand, because you bid 2@C.|

hondo717: |cp||at|That is a problem, if you have diamonds but not spades there is no real way to find out if I have spades.  In this case, the auction should have gone as on the left. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have a couple of things to discuss.  ally is really too strong by the rule of 20 to open 3@C.  However, because she is short in both majors, it could work out well as a tactic. The risk she takes is it might preempt Ira if he has a good hand. But the reward is it might preempt us. The other point is on the play. At trick two ally cashed the ace of clubs and then led a low club to the King. If clubs were not 2-2, she ends up blocking herself from drawing the 3rd trump. In general, in order to avoid blocking yourself, you cash the honors in the short hand first, and then lead towards the long hand - club to the king, club back to the ace.|

UP|32|PF|Y|nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some comments. Should ally bid 4H? The  answer is probably not. Basically, if I am not sure whether or not to bid game over a 3 level preempt, I picture partner having seven to AQ. If  I think that is enough for me to be in game, then I bid it. In this case, probably not, as it looks to ally as if there are 2 club losers, and a spade, and probably a heart. A diamond is correct as an opening lead. However, the J is considered an honor and the standard lead from pam's holding is the 3. You only lead the J from J10x or J doubleton.|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the rest of the defense, it was good.  pam can see that we are in danger of giving Ira pitches on diamonds, so we have to take 3 black suit tricks. Her under lead of the ace of clubs was very good, because I need the king of clubs in order to beat the hand. And, if I happened to hold KJ10 of clubs, and Ira has the Q, then I can lead clubs through Ira. So, although normally I discourage under leading aces against suits, occasionally, when you can figure out a good reason, it is right to under lead the ace.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at|Well, they got to a good contract, but sort of by accident :).  First of all, let me again remind everyone that you should always be on the lookout to double artificial bids as lead directing. These doubles come up particularly often after Stayman, transfers, and responses to Blackwood. So try and keep them in mind. Now, let us get back to whether ally should bid or not. Usually, with a ^*Bflat^*N 10, pass of weak 1N is a good idea.|

IraCT(Ira): Howard If you don't double  where do we wind up?|
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|That is a good question Ira. First, If I had passed ally, and Ira had bid 2@D, what were you going to do?|
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


AT|  camilleln(ally): Bid 2NT.|
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


cp|8|at|   hondo717: |cp||at|And Ira bids 3N. Then, because of the 9 card diamond fit, and the fact that Ira has a max, including the J of spades, it makes, but it rates to go down more often with your hand. So, as I was saying, in general, I recommend pass over a weak NT if you have a flat 10.|
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


NT|^B@2
IraCT(Ira): Howard Ally doesn't have a flat hand ?|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Any hand with at most one doubleton is considered |cp|8|at|"flat."|cp||at|  ally is close to a 2@C bid. If ally were 4-4 in the majors, she could then bid 2@C, because of the type of Stayman we play.  Because with any 4-4 hand as responder to weak 1N, if the 1N bidder bids 2@D, denying a major, then responder can bid 2@H, which tells the NT bidder to pass or correct to 2@S. Anyway, ally is right on the border of bidding Stayman, and, as it turns out, had I not doubled they get to a good 3N contract.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, my comments. With 4-4 in the majors, the responder to 1N should always bid Stayman, because it is usually better to play in a 4-4 fit if possible. And, over a weak NT, I like to play "major suit garbage Stayman." That means, even if partner bids 2@D over 2@C, the responder can then bid 2@H, showing 4-4 or better in the major. The NT opener passes if his hearts are better, and corrects to 2@S if his spades are better. In this case ira's hearts were better, so he passed, but if his hearts and spades were reversed, he could bid 2@S.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although with 3-3 in the majors, pass is ok as well.  ally would bid 2@C, even with a weak hand. However, with her hand, had Ira bid 2@H or 2@S, she can raise to 3, since she has an invitational hand once they find a major suit fit. So in this case, her Stayman also serves as a mean to decide whether or not her hand is strong enough to invite.|

IraCT(Ira): Howard  should Ally pass my 2@D bid.  After you doubled I think I am showing 5? |

hondo717: |cp||at|Some people play that since I doubled 2@C, Ira can pass because he doesn't have to bid. So his bidding 2@D should show some diamond tolerance, at least 4. If you play that, then ally could pass 2@D, since they have at least a 7 card fit, and maybe even an 8 card fit.|

mausie: Howard what is the advantage in playing weak NT vs regular?|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|As to why I like the weak NT, there are a number of reasons. the most important is, 1N is a very descriptive opener, and by playing weak NT, you get to open 1N much more often. There are other reasons I like the weak NT as well -- it preempts the opponents, and when you open one of a suit, you tend to have a 5 card suit, even in the minors. You can more information at my site at   ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/#weaknt^*N.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at|The main point of this hand is my 4@S bid. Once North opens, I know we have game. It is my responsibility to get us there. That is a very important principle that less experienced players sometimes miss. The principle is, as responder you are usually "captain" of the hand which  means, responder has the primary responsibility for figuring out the final contract. In this particular case, with a good (although not great) 7 card suit, it seemed like 4@S was our best shot.|

nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at|I could have made some other forcing bid, like 2@D, over 2@C, but it seemed like the best course of action was to bid what I thought we could make. It is barely possible we might make 6@S with the right hand from North, but it would be hard to figure that out.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at|Lots to discuss on this hand. I we will start with the play. Notice I lead a low heart, even though I did not have an honor. My rule is, it is more important to show partner count if you have not supported her/his suit. So, since I did not support ally originally, I led low, so that she knows I have 3. On this hand, that is reasonably important. Had I supported ally, I would have led the 10, to show that I had no honor, because then ally would know I didn't have a doubleton.|

nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|ally's 8 of hearts back at trick three was a suit preference for diamonds. Good play. The other play I want to discuss was Dee's "loser on loser" play at trick eleven. it was quite good. The idea here is that I was ruffing with a natural trump trick anyway  and dee has diamond losers. so she might as well pitch her diamond loser, since it doesn't cost anything. If she had overruffed with the Ace, she would lose an additional trick, the 8 of spades plus the 2 diamonds. |
PG| ***** 171 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at|The way she played it, she got to score her 8 of spades. loser on loser is a very good declarer play technique, worth remembering. Now as to the auction. The main problem actually was dee's original overcall. She is too strong for a simple overcall. A simple overcall is usually limited to 15 points or less. dee should double with her hand|

^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at|That is true dee, but you still have a 6-4 hand with 16 HCP  not counting the @HQJ.|
PG| ***** 174 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at|Basically, dee needs to double first. On this particular hand, she even has the benefit of having spades. But even if she just had a strong hand with clubs, and not spades, she can double and then "correct" to clubs if pam bids diamonds.  Double and correcting partners suit to a suit of your own is how you show a strong hand.|
PG| ***** 175 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at|Now, given the 2@C bid, I would have passed with pam's hand, not even bid 2@D  because, assuming dee has less than 16, game is not possible. However, let us accept pam's 2@D bid for the sake of argument. Now, when dee bids 2@S, pam can still pass, because she "knows" dee does not have 16. I might venture a 3@S bid with pam's hand, because her points seem to be working, but passing is not terrible. In fact, with a 3-2 spade break, 4@S makes, and they should be there.|

** |FP||cp||at|Basically, if I am not sure whether or not to bid game over a 3 level preempt, I picture partner having seven to AQ. If  I think that is enough for me to be in game, then I bid it.
|FP|2|cp|8|at| 
** |FP||cp||at|You only lead the J from J10x or J doubleton.
|FP|2|cp|8|at|
** |FP||cp||at|You should always be on the lookout to double artificial bids as lead directing. These doubles come up particularly often against Stayman, transfers, and responses to Blackwood.   
|FP|2|cp|8|at|
** |FP||cp||at|Any hand with at most one doubleton is considered "flat."

^C @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.  

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N|
