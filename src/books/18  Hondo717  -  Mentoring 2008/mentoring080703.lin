^D @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.

^*Bhondo717:^*N aggie, before you bid let us discuss your option here. What would you bid if you had 6-9 points?|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |

PG| ***** 4 ***** |

^*Bhondo717:^*N And how many points do you need to bid 3N?|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


AT|     delcod1: 10|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717:^*N Well, that is a bit aggressive, how about 12 which is game force. Basically, in this situation 1N by you shows 6-9, 2N shows invitational hand, 10-11, 3N with 12 or more.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT|
moedraznin: Howard, 2nt requires stoppers in unbid suits?|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717:^*N Yes. If not, aggie probably would have a jump raise in one of kia's suits with an invitational hand.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |

^*Bhondo717:^*N Now, go ahead and bid aggie.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


AT|
nome: What are recommendations had aggie did not have a four card major? |
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717:^*N I personally like to play 1N is 6-9, 2N 10-bad 12, 3N good 12 or more, but most people play 1N 6-10, 2N 11-12 and 13 plus.|

PF|Y|NT|^B@2 
^*Bhondo717:^*N Good playing aggie. A club was a good lead. Either the 10 or low is fine. moe has 4, and it is the unbid suit. Now, let us review aggie's responsibilities as responder. Before I forget, I have a good tutorial on this subject, called "Introduction to Constructive Bidding". suggest you download it from my web site at

^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/IntroToConstructive%20Bidding.txt^*N. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
^*Bhondo717:^*N Now, back to aggie's responsibilities. There is a concept known as "captain" of the bidding. During most auctions, one of the partners is the "captain" and the other is the "subordinate." At the risk of sounding sexist, it turns out in most co-ed partnerships, the male always wants to be the "captain" and the "female" the subordinate :). Sad but true.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N However, if you want to play good bridge, that is not how it should be. Typically, responder is the captain. The captain is responsible for placing the final contract. The captain asks the subordinate questions, via the bidding, and the subordinate answers them. For example, on this hand, aggie should notice she has an invitational hand and she wants to be in game if kia has an intermediate or better hand, 15 or more points. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N The main bidding weapon the responder/captain has, is making forcing bids. New suit by responder is always forcing. In this hand, aggie needs to find out two things. First, what suit (or NT) should the hand be played in and second, whether or not to be in game. In this sequence, once kia bids diamonds and spades, it is clear they should be in NT. Now aggie knows they should be in NT, the question is what level. Since kia did not jump shift to 2@S, he can have 17 points at most, however, he could have as little as 12 points.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N aggie has to find out if kia is at the top of his range or not. If she has an opening hand, she should just bid 3N. With a minimum hand, she can bid 1N (6-9), and then, if kia has 17 or a good 16, it is up to him to go on. However, if she has an in-between hand, as a 11-12 points. she must tell kia , by bidding 2N, she has an in between hand and leave the final decision to him.|at|

^*Bhondo717:^*N now, kia overbid here quite a bit. So, aggie, you may pretend you are in 2@S.  kia really should only bid 2@S, he has an opening hand, that is all. |

PG| ***** 30 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717:^*N You do not get information from your captain, you tell her the truth, lol. But worse you lied to the captain, because you showed 15-17 with your bid :).   And, now poor aggie is left picking up the pieces :).|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT|^B@2

UP|40|PF|Y|NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N OK, let us go over the bidding one bid at a time. One club was fine. Now, you might wonder why, with an opening hand, I did not bid. Because, I have no good bid. If I make a takeout double, I am short one diamond. I should have 3 cards in all the unbid suits. So I decided to lay in wait and see what happened, which worked out well on this hand. If I had a couple of more points, I could not afford to wait, but with only 13, it is likely the hand will not get passed out.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N And, aggie's one spade bid was fine. Pass would have been ok too, but we are trying to get her to be aggressive.  It is true kia does not know how many points aggie has, other than at least 5. But it does not matter, as his job is to describe his hand. His job is two folds at this point:
One, is to describe whether or not they have a fit; and
Two, describe how many points he has. |
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N In this case he has an easy bid of 2@S,  with 4 spades and a minimum 12-14 hand. Obviously, he has a choice of bidding 2 spades, 3 spades, or 4 spades, depending on how strong his hand is. You can divide opening bids into 3 categories:|CP|8|AT|
Minimum is 12 - 14
Medium is 15 - 17, and 
Maximum is 18+.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


CP||NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N In this example, kia would bid 2@S to shows a minimum, 3@S to shows a medium, and 4@S to shows a max. However, since kia has a minimum (aggie knows he has at least 12 points), he need only bid 2@S. That bid gives aggie a pretty good picture of  his hand, and can act accordingly.  Now, aggie's question, which many people ask is, "how can I pass a minor with only 2 card support?"|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Well, let me ask you this aggie. If kia had opened 1 heart or 1 spade, and you had 1 or 2 points, but zero spades, would you pass? |
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


AT|  delcod1: Yes.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717:^*N Well, granted, kia could open 1@C with as few as 3 clubs, but the principle is the same.  First of all, about 85% of the time, opener opens 1 of a minor with a 4 card suit.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


AT|
moedraznin: If you have nothing I will have some and most likely balance anyway.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717:^*N And moe rightfully made my second point. |
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N If you pass aggie, it is likely moe will take action, because it is rarely right to let the opponents play at the one level. So, never worry about passing one of a minor, just like you don't worry about passing one of a major.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717:^*N Should aggie bid 1@D rather than 1@S?   Ten or 15 years ago, the style was to bid up the line, including showing diamonds before a 4 card major. However, these days that is not the style. The idea is to get your majors in quickly when you have a weak hand. |
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
^*Bhondo717:^*N So with 9 points or less, you bypass a diamond suit and bid the major. With more than that, you can bid diamonds first, as you will feel comfortable taking another bid.

Basically, bypass diamonds with a bad hand, and don't with a good hand. On the other hand, Some people play that they always bypass diamonds, but I don't think that is necessary. Now, as to bidding with 5 points. Hard as it is to believe, aggie was more aggressive than I would be. |
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
However, she was partly motivated by her club shortness. Responding with 5 point hands  depends on how good they are. Her hand is a very bad 5 points, only Qs and Js and no 10s. If she had something like KQxxx, xx, xx, xxx then bidding one spade is fine. So, don't respond with 5 points unless you have a good suit, or you want to preempt the opponents (for example if she had 5 clubs, 3 clubs is a good tactic.)  Otherwise, I recommend pass.|at|

^*Bhondo717:^*N Now, I have a tough decision to make.  I know kia has no more spades, because moe must have had 4 to bid 3@S  and I know he has a lot of clubs. There are 2 ways to go here.  I can play a trump hoping to cut down on dummy's ruffs or I can play a club, because I worry about kia running diamonds after drawing trumps.  I will play a heart and hope kia cant throw away all his clubs.|

UP|52|NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Let us talk about the bidding. Bidding seems to be the theme today. aggie has several choices over 1@S. They are 2@D, 2@H, and 2@S.  I don't particularly like 2@H, because her suit is so bad.  If I opened 1@C, I might try 1@H with that kind of suit, but at the 2 level, you really should have a better suit. I might very well choose 2@D with such a good suit.  However, then aggie will never get her heart length across. So 2@S is a reasonable alternative as well.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N It kind of worked out, although it got them too high. However, I think that was mostly because kia was on steroids tonight, and was bidding very aggressively, lol.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


AT| 
moedraznin: They had little choice after my 3@S.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


AT|
^*Bhondo717:^*N Now, let us discuss moe's choices of bids. With spade support he has 3 choices. He can double, which, in this case is a "stolen bid double", which means he has a 2@S bid  -6 to 9 and probably with 3 Spades.  He can bid 3@H which is a "cue" bid. The reason it is a cue bid, is because aggie implicitly bid hearts and  moe is cue bidding her suit.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N The cue bid shows a limit raise or better in spades, usually with 4 trump. Or he can bid 3@S, which shows less than a limit raise, and 4 card support or more. I did not bid 4@S, especially after kia's club bid, because moe has less than a limit raise.  However, it turns out 4 spades makes, so I was wrong.|at|

^*Bhondo717:^*N The bidding was fine and the play was ok, except for a couple of things. I don't think you can make it. However, you should not play the Ace of diamonds, as you need to ruff clubs in dummy. If you do not play the Ace, then Ira cannot draw your trumps and cash his clubs. As far as playing the K of clubs, you are right, unlikely kia has the ace, so might as well play low. A heart at trick 2 is fine. But the key point was not to surrender control of the trump suit, as you want to try and ruff a club or two.

^*Bhondo717:^*N lucky to make 6. need 3-2 hearts and 3-3 clubs. about 25%. Played well regardless. Now, let me just elaborate on the bidding a little.  ira's one spade bid was a bit aggressive, but ok particularly given the vulnerability. You can overcall at the one level with as little as 7 or 8 points if you have a good suit, which Ira does.  The only thing he needs to worry about is that his Q of hearts is probably not a good card, so he really has more like an effective 5 or 6 count. If @HQ of hearts was in one of the minors, it would be clear cut to bid 1@S.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N The point is, not only do you need to count your points, but you need to evaluate them in the context of the auction. You tend to downgrade cards in the opponents suits, and upgrade cards in partners suits. On close bids, you need to take that into account, which is why I am not sure I would bid 1@S with ira's hand.|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N Now, as far as my 1N bid is concerned if an opponent overcalls, I am no longer obligated to bid with 6 points because partner can always come in if he has a good hand, so I don't need to worry about missing a game. Therefore, my 1N bid is a little stronger. most people play 1N after an overcall is about 8-10 with a stopper in the overcalled suit. I could bid 2N because I had 11 points, but I chose to be conservative.|

PG| ***** 126 ***** |

^*Bhondo717:^*N Good question. 1N should normally promise 2 card heart support. In which case moe can reasonably bid 4@H. On occasion, if my spades are particularly good, I might do it with a singleton heart, just to get my spade points across. But moe is allowed to assume I have two.

^*Bhondo717:^*N Had ira bid here, my responses are as follows:
Pass, if my bid would have been below whatever Ira bid.  So, for example, if Ira bid 3@D, pass means I would have bid 3@C; 
Double means "stolen bid", that is the bid I would have made, and
All other bids are natural.  You can play the same thing if someone interferes with blackwood, although there are other systems as well.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N ok, that play was just hoping that kia would play low if he had the ace of diamonds. was hoping for a misdefense. However, if kia had the ace of diamonds, despite my admonition to usually play 2nd hand low, it is always right to take the setting trick.|

UP|33|NT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717:^*N So, one important exception to 2nd hand low is, if you can beat the contract, it is ok to play 2nd hand high. Another comment on the auction.  If your partner opens a weak 2, and you have 3 card support, it is virtually almost always right for you to either bid 3 of that suit with a weakish hand, or 2N if you might want to bid game. The reason it is almost always right to bid at three level is, using my guidelines of the number of trumps equals the level you should bid. It is ok for us to be at the 3 level (9 trick contract) if we have a nine card fit.|
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
^*Bhondo717:^*N So here, moe can bid 3@S.  There is just one tactical issue, particularly with spades. If you think the 3@S bid will result in their bidding a game they might not otherwise bid, then you might pass even with 3 card support. However, if you have a weak hand with 3 card support, it is likely they will get to game somewhere, so you might as well bid 3@S to make it harder for the opponents.  It is not clear if ira can make 4 hearts, as he has 2 spades and a heart loser for sure, but if he guesses the hearts, and because of the way diamonds are, he can make 4.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N ok, I made a mistake here, with 12 points I should bid 4. I miscounted due to chatting.  However, moe is not close to a takeout double. If you are an unpassed hand, a takeout double in direct seat pretty much guarantees an opening hand. It also pretty much guarantees 4 cards in the unbid major. Let me repeat, a takeout double shows an opening hand, unless you are a passed hand, in balancing seat, or have some other agreement (and if you do, must be alerted.)|
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
^*Bhondo717:^*N So moe does not have a takeout double for two reasons, lack of points and lack of hearts. However, I should bid 4@H over 2@S, as I have an opening hand, and so does moe in theory.  4@H down 1 as it turns out, so ends up the same. On the other hand, I will make if I guess the clubs.  But normally would lose 2 spades a diamond and a club.|at|

^*Bhondo717:^*N As you all know, I can see the four hands. But here I like to share my thoughts about choosing the lead based on my hand and the auction. Normally, I would have led a spade with this hand. However, I know from the auction kia has 5 so pard has one. The reason I know pard has one is because kia's 3N bid showed 5 spades, with six he would probably have made a texas transfer.  ira must have exactly 2 spades since he passed 3N. As I have said before, the auction often gives you many clues about the hands.|
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So, I know a spade is probably not a good lead.  I also know that moe can only have 4 or 5 points at most. Why?  I have 11, and they should have 25 between them, so that only leaves 4 for moe at best. Perhaps they stretched, and moe has 5, but more likely he has 4 or less. Thus, I will lead a heart, in the hope he has 4 hearts, even if he has no honors. since I have 2 aces, if moe happens to  have 4 hearts, they will go down. My conclusions really had nothing to do with looking at other three hands.|

^*Bhondo717:^*N Nicely done ira. The reason his club play is right is, if the Q wins, he will probably finesse the 10 on the way back as I should have the Ace.  He was lucky I had stiff ace. But because he made the right play, he was rewarded :).|at|

^C@2nome: As added emphasis on Howard's teaching I have decided each week to collect many of his @E@3important instructions in one page under "Howard's Pearls" which we can go over them many times. The following are my picks. I am sure you will find many more.|fp|2|at|

If you are an unpassed hand, a takeout double in direct seat pretty much guarantees an opening hand. It also pretty much guarantees 4 cards in the unbid major.

Carefully listen to the auction. It often gives you many clues about the hands.

If you can beat the contract, it is ok to play 2nd hand high.

Over opponent's takeout double, here is what is usually played:

1) One level bids are forcing one round, retaining the same meaning as if there was no takeout double (at least six points, but can be unlimited).

2) Two level bids show 5+ card suits, and deny 10 points.

3) Redouble with 10 or more points, and no appropriate one level bid.

4) Some people play Jordan 2N, where a 2N bid shows 10+ points and 4 card support for opener's suit (e.g. a limit raise).
