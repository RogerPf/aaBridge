hondo717: |cp||at|yes. my weak 2 gave Ira a problem. His solution worked out, but his bid was a bit of a risk.  kia made a nice bid of 3N.  In this case a heart lead was neutral at best, but in general, it is best to lead partner's suit. more often it is right than wrong. And it promotes partnership rapport.  The J was correct. High from a doubleton. It is important for me to know the location of the honor.|

PF|Y|NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Well, everything started well on that hand.  My 3 diamonds was fine, although my suit was a little weak. The 3N by moe was a well considered bid.  If I have AK seventh of diamonds, moe can count nine tricks. Now, to the play.  kia's spade lead was good. As you know, I advocate 4th best from longest unless partner has bid another suit, or the opponents have bid your best suit.  So the spade was right.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|And some of you may remember from last week, one of my defensive principles. Once partner picks a defense, best you stick with it, unless there is a good reason not to.  In this case, a spade looks fine from ira's perspective, so if he simply returns another spade, moe has no plays, By returning a club, the defense "lost a tempo", in this case lost knocking out the spade stopper, and this gave moe a chance to make it.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
hondo717: |cp||at|As to the play of the diamond suit, in this case it doesn't matter what moe does. However, there are 2 combinations where moe can take all seven diamond tricks. The more common one, and the one I would have chosen is to hope for a singleton King of diamonds. In that case, moe takes all the diamond tricks.  The other way to take all the diamonds is to play kia for K6 and ira for stiff J. Leading the Q, as moe did, caters to that possibility. |
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
hondo717: |cp||at|However, the singleton K play is slightly better, as the singleton K can be in either hand, whereas moe's play depends on ira specifically having the singleton J. So, leading a low diamond is a slightly better way of increasing your odds. In general, when you have two alternative lines, and you can figure out the odds, pick the play that gives you better odds. |

@D@D@D As with all the boards you can play this hand double dummy using Howards recommendations. Try it and see if you can set the contract.|

PF|Y|nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
hondo717: |cp||at|OK, let us discuss the auction first.  moe has 2 choices of bids, either 2@D or 2N. I prefer 2N, because it is more descriptive and more preemptive. However, the downside of 2N is it is also more descriptive to the opponents. As for what kia should bid. He is right on the border of a limit raise. However, in general, queens and jacks with no supporting aces and kings should be downgraded. So I think he is just short of a limit raise, because all his points are in Qs and Js.  On the plus side, he has 9s and 10s to go with his Qs and Js, so it is close. |
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
hondo717: |cp||at|So I think 3@H is slightly better than 3@D as kia's bid. And, if moe leads anything but a club, it is down 1, so despite ira's 15 HCP plus 2 distribution points, it is not a great game.  moe's lead of a club is best from his hand. I would have led a club also. Unfortunately it doesn't work out. The reason a club is best in general (although not on this hand) is because leading an ace or away from an ace is usually not a good idea, as I have said many times. And leading a singleton trump, often gives away a trick. So, I think a club is the best lead, given the auction and what moe has even though it didn't happen to work on this hand.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
hondo717: |cp||at|Opening leads are very difficult, so if you follow my guidelines, they tend to work out best, although sometimes they still cost. Some of my guidelines are as follows:|cp|8|at|
1) In a suit contract, never lead an ace (unless you have Ax and partner bid the suit), or away from an ace
2) lead partner's suit
3) lead an unbid suit
4) don't lead a singleton trump.|cp||

nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
hondo717: |cp||at|Yes, well done judy. Now, let me talk a smidgen about the defense before getting into the doubles. After you win the spade pam, ok to play the 2nd spade, but you should realize that judy is not going to need to trump anything. The point I am trying to make is about the defense based on the bidding and opening lead. You should be able to play judy with AQ tight of hearts. In this case, it really doesn't make that much difference, but is good habit to get into.|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A Kib: How do you know she has @HAQ?|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|I presumably have 7, she has 3, the board has 1, leaving judy with 2. I wouldn't lead away from an ace, and judy played the Q, therefore she must have started with AQ. Now, do you see why you can work out judy's holding, right?  It is just a little logic, and counting to 13.|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
hondo717: |cp||at|Now as to whether or not pam should bid 4 hearts. From a purely competitive aspect, since she knows we have 10 trumps, 4@H is a very reasonable bid, There is a tactical issue here however. If pam thinks they can make 4 spades, then she should not bid 4 hearts, because you do not want to push the opponents into 4 spades. But, it is hard to judge with pam's hand, because AJ10 are worth 2 tricks in spades. So I would say pam should not be afraid to bid 4 hearts, in the sense of our being too high.|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2 
hondo717: |cp||at|However, she should worry about pushing them into a 4 spade game that they might not otherwise bid. Thus, the decision is not clear cut. But if you have a 10 card fit, it is rarely dangerous to be at the 4 level. Because I use the law of total tricks all the time in my competitive bidding calculations, I really encourage my partners to have the right number of cards in their suit when  preempting. Now, let me address  high level doubles. There are many ways to play doubles at the 3 level.  I will tell you what I play, and you can decide what you like based on your comfort level.|
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
hondo717: |cp||at|I play negative doubles through 3 spades.  By negative doubles, I mean you are guaranteeing 4+ cards in the unbid major. your minor suit holdings not as important. As to the number of hcp I will give you some guidelines, but a lot has to do with where your hcp are. Remember, you should tend to discount high cards in the opponents suit (even aces) and upgrade high cards in partner's suits. The reason you discount high cards in the opponents suit is that it is less likely that partner has honors in that suit, and combinations of honors work much better than isolated honors.|
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
hondo717: |cp||at|For the auction at the one level, you need only 6 points, at the two level, 8 points and  at the 3 level, 10 points with no wastage in the opponents suit. These are rough guidelines. If, for example, you have a really good major suit (say KQJxxx) and shortness in the opponents suit, you can have fewer high card points. The value of your hand is not static. It changes as the bidding proceeds. In this  klaus only had 8 hcp, but he had a fit in clubs and a singleton heart, so very good double.|
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
hondo717: |cp||at|What about if the opponents preempt to the 4 level. In that case, you should play what I will call "cooperative doubles." A double at the 4 level just shows some values, some defense (at least a trick and a half.)  Partner can leave the double in with some defense of her own, or pull it with a good suit or a hand that seems more suitable for offense. It is rare that you get a pure penalty double on those sorts of auctions, so you have to let pard know you have values, and let them make the final decision. And, a double at the 4 level does not guarantee the unbid major. It is not negative double.|

hondo717: |cp||at|Very nice judy. judy made a great play at trick one. She did what is known as a "bath coup". This came up in one of my other lessons a week or 2 ago, but I will review it again. If the opening leader leads the K from KQ, and Declarer holds the J in her hand, with the ace in either the dummy or her hand, she should duck the trick. That way, if the suit is led again, as it was here, Declarer is guaranteed 2 stoppers.|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
hondo717: |cp||at|And if it is not led again, then at least Declarer still has their stopper intact. Now, once judy takes 2 diamond tricks, she can count nine tricks.  2 spades at least, 3 hearts, 2 diamonds, and 2 clubs, for nine tricks. So, judy did a nice job of planning the hand, knocking out the 2 spades, to establish nine tricks. As you know, I am an advocate of planning at trick one, and judy did a nice demo of that technique. |

However, it is always problematical to open 2@C with a long diamond suit, because the auction usually goes 2@C-2@D-3@D and  the wrong hand often ends up as Declarer, and the bidding gets awfully high awfully fast. When you have a marginal 2@C opener with long diamonds or even clubs, usually it is better to open 1 than 2. Now, let me explain ways to respond to 2@C.|
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


NT|^B@2
hondo717: |cp||at|Most people play 2@D is "waiting". For many people, it is virtually always the response to 2@C. Any other suit bid by responder promises a 5+ card suit, with at least 2 of the top 3 honors. So if I bid 2@H, 2@S, 3@C, or 3@D, that would show a good suit.|

PG| ***** 122 ***** |


cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|To answer kia, if you have KQxxxx of a suit, you can still bid it. Now, another wrinkle some people play is that responder bids 2@H with no controls (no aces or kings.)|

PG| ***** 124 ***** |


cp|8|at|  hondo717: |cp||at|Yes, but a bust can even be 6 points or so, if you have no aces or kings.|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


NT||cp|8|at|^B@2
hondo717: |cp||at|The idea is that controls are important for slam bids, and 2@C is forcing to game. So, if you play 2@H is no controls, then a 2N bid by responder is how you show a heart suit. It is a little confusing, but hopefully you can figure out why the 2N bid is needed if you play 2@H is bust. Finally, over 2@C some people respond with the number of controls they have. A king is considered "1 control" an ace is considered "2 controls."|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


NT||cp|8|at|^B@2
hondo717: |cp||at|So, if you play control responses, 2@D shows 0 or 1 control (no more than 1 king), 2@H shows 2 controls (an ace or 2 kings), 2@S shows an ace and a king, and 2N shows 3 kings, 3C shows 4+ controls (but never comes up.)  I do not recommend that system, as it often wrong side gets the contract and may get you too high.  I recommend you play 2@D waiting, new suits show good suits, and, optionally 2@H shows no controls.|

hondo717: |cp||at|Very good moe. Your line was the only chance to make it. So you played it correctly. kia does have a rule of 20 opener. However, over 2@H, he probably should just bid 3@C That way, he gives moe a good picture of his hand.  Actually, they are not playing 2 over 1, but even if they were, makes no difference. However,  I don't think kia plays forcing NT and I should have said something then moe. Playing sayc, 2@H would be an ok bid with your hand moe. You probably still end up in 3N.|
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2 
hondo717: |cp||at|Now, as to my signaling. Once aggie takes 4 heart tricks, I want to score one of my kings. I signaled spades so aggie would lead a spade. And I purposely signaled a low diamond to entice moe into taking the diamond finesse. That way, I was pretty sure we were beating it two tricks. In general, you should signal to help your partner, but occasionally you can try and fool Declarer|

hondo717: |cp||at|OK, interesting auction.  We already discussed why I think double is a better bid with aggie's hand. In general, if you can show a strong NT, you should do it, but in this particular case, aggie's lack of diamonds plus her very good majors make double the better bid. kia's heart bid is fine. Now, the question is, how many spades should I bid. With 10 points, I should jump to 2 spades.  And one could argue that I have 10 points if spades are trumps or at least 9 with a fifth spade. If kia had passed, I might decide to bid 2 spades.|
PG| ***** 173 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
hondo717: |cp||at|aggie is presumably showing 4 cards in both majors. Occasionally the doubler will be 4-3, but as responder you need to assume 4-4. Now, why does it make a difference that kia bid vs passing.  I know aggie has hearts, because of the double. And once kia bids hearts, I realize that aggie's heart points may not be that useful. So I downgraded my hand a little bit, as I though my singleton heart might not be that useful in combination with aggie's hand. |
PG| ***** 174 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
hondo717: |cp||at|And I know that moe may be somewhat short in hearts behind me as well. Further, my Q of diamonds does not seem all that useful either. So I bid 1@S,. I still must have something a little extra, because I could have passed over 1@H. moe should not bid 1NT because he does not have spade stopper.  I think 2@H might be better than 2@D, but 1N is definitely not as good as either 2@H or 2@D.|

cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Well, if he only has 4 hearts than he must have a reasonable hand, as he could pass the double.|
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2
hondo717: |cp||at|kia does not absolutely promise 5 hearts, but he either has 5 hearts or a pretty good hand. because he can pass. Now, the question is what should aggie bid given I don't have 10 points and didn't jump. I think 2@S followed by 3@S is ok. Further, her hearts do not look well positioned. As to whether we should be in 4. Please note that moe's cashing 2 diamonds gave me a club pitch. without the club pitch, I cannot make 4.|

hondo717: |cp||at|To answer your question aggie, since kia bid hearts, I decided to play him for the ace. Of course, since I can see all 4 hands, I could have played the king. However, at a real table, I would have played the J.

^C@2nome: As added emphasis on Howard's teaching I have decided each week to collect many of his @E@3important instructions in one page under "Howard's Pearls" which we can go over them many times. The following are my picks. I am sure you will find many more.|fp|2|at|

**  Once partner picks a defense, best you stick with it, unless there is a good reason not to.

**  In general, when you have two alternative lines, and you can figure out the odds, pick the play that gives you better odds.

**  Leading an ace or away from an ace is usually not a good idea, as I have said many times. And leading a singleton trump, often gives away a trick.

**  The reason you discount high cards in the opponents suit is that it is less likely that partner has honors in that suit, and combinations of honors work much better than isolated honors.

^D @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.  

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the BBO toolbar to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N|
