NT|^B@2|cp|8|at| 
hondo717: |cp||at|OK. the most important point is that both diane and aggie were a bit conservative, and hence missed their 3N game. Because diane is 4-3-3-3, it is ok to deduct a point and open 1N, but it is conservative.  My rule is I invite with 8 points and a 5 card suit, and any 9 point hand. So aggie should invite because she has 5 diamonds  even with the singleton. Generally, you need to look for excuses to bid, not for excuses not to bid.|

hondo717: |cp||at|As for the play, the 10 of clubs was fine diane, I might have K and J. And one minor note on the heart return by elizabeth at trick two. You should return the 10, not the 9. Returning the 9 denies the 10, and may make me misdefend. I am not against trying to fool declarer, but if you have a choice, better to inform partner rather than trying to fool declarer.|

NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|ok, this was a very good example of a common advanced declarer play technique known as a "strip and end play." When when aggie is in with the K of clubs, she is stuck. If she leads a club or a heart, elizabeth can sluff her losing diamond from her hand, and ruff in dummy. If aggie leads a diamond, as she did, then elizabeth can play for split honors, and eliminate the diamond loser. The idea is, if elizabeth plays diamonds herself, she will lose a diamond and a club, and be down 1. But by eliminating all the side suits from both hands (stripping both hands), and throwing us in, she makes one of us give her the extra trick she needs to make the hand.|

PG| ***** 37 ***** |


cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|To answer aggie's question, if she leads the J of diamonds, then elizabeth needs to play for split honors. So elizabeth wins the A of diamonds and plays the 10, intending to finesse me for the Q. If you lead the J of diamonds, it makes it harder, but elizabeth should play for split honors, meaning she should play me for the Q.|

NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|First let us discuss the auction. The question is, what should north do over 1@S? My general rule is to not rescue partner when there is an apparent misfit. So, given aggie opened clubs, and north has no clubs, I think pass is better in general than 1N. Now, let us examine elizabeth's 2@C bid. It is certainly a reasonable call. The only thing she should be worried about is a tactical consideration. She only has one heart, and aggie has at most 4, since aggie opened 1@C, not 1@H therefore, elizabeth knows that n/s have an 8 card heart fit. Or perhaps even more than an 8 card fit. So, she might consider passing, because 1N is probably not as good a contract as hearts.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


SB|N|NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Again, these are tactical considerations. 2@C per se is not a bad bid. But you need to take into account as much information as you can. |

hondo717: |cp||at|Well, that worked out well for e/w, but I am a little skeptical of diane's opener. It isn't even close to meeting the rule of 20. She was lucky that aggie had no wasted heart points. diane had a great fit, which is why the contract made. Having said that, this hand does illustrate the power of 2 suited hands. Even though diane only has six points, if she can find a fit with aggie, her hand is probably worth around an opener or even better. And the reason it works out particularly well is because if diane passes, I open 3@H, and harder to find game. Although even if aggie passes my 3@H bid, diane's hand is worth a balance of 3@S.|

NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Now, I want to discuss my pass, which the kibs all disagree with :). As, we might have game, so my pass might be wrong. However, the hand is probably a misfit and therefore, all of the points might not be working. We have at most 26 points between us, and could have considerably less. granted if ally has a few clubs, we might make a lot of tricks in NT, assuming we have a double diamond  stopper. |
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|However, 3N seems like a risky bid, and if I bid 2N, Ogust, and ally bids 3@C or 3@D, showing 5-7, we end if in 3 hearts instead of 2. So, again, I weighed the risks vs. the rewards, and chose to pass. but, as I said, it was not clear at all. As to whether or not to open a weak 2 with a 4 card major, that is a matter of style. I would say more experts than not do not believe in opening a weak 2 with a 4 card major, but I think it is fine.|
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Regarding the play of hand, there were a couple of defensive issues. At trick four, Pam led a low spade back for ira to ruff, so he should take that as a suit preference and lead a low club. That makes it easier for pam to figure out the club suit. However, she should probably figure it out anyway. |
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Ally is already known to have six hearts and 4 spades, leaving her only 3 cards in the minors. She has already shown up with 1 club and 1 diamond. So, the only time it is right for Pam to go up with the K of clubs is if Ally started with Jx of clubs. Had that been the case, Ally would have just ruffed a diamond to get back to her hand, and taken the club finesse herself. Therefore, when Ally plays A of clubs at trick six and a club at trick 7, Pam should duck the club.|

NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|OK, there was some excellent defense by pam on this hand  and that is the key point. Her heart duck was absolutely brilliant. If she doesn't do that, ally makes the hand easily. The reason it makes sense is she can see there is only a possible spade entry on the board, not a diamond entry and ally does not have more than 2 hearts, based on the bidding, so by ducking she makes it hard for ally to get to dummy. Also, there were a couple of minor technique issues I want to discuss on the defense. |
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|When leading back partner's suit as in trick two, you lead back "remaining count."  So, after winning the first club, pam would lead back high club if she had a doubleton left (e.g. she started with 3), and low with 3 left. Therefore, the 5 of clubs is the correct lead back.  That helps ira figure out how many clubs ally has.  ally, also made a slight error on the 2nd club trick. She should win with the K, not the Q.  When you play the Q and it wins, pam and ira now know you have the K, whereas if you play the K, the location of the Q is still a mystery.|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|Thus, your play as declarer is sort of opposite that of defender. As defender, you would play the Q, so partner knows you have the K. However, since you could care less whether dummy knows what you have or not, lol, you should play the K to hide the Q.|

NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|OK. This hand illustrated some good bidding principles regarding competing after a weak NT. Since they were playing Brozel, which I will briefly explain in a minute, pam's 2@S bid was fine, showing spades and a minor. Unlike with the strong NT, where I suggest systems on/stolen bid doubles, I suggest you play Lebensohl as partner of the weak NT bidder. So, if there is an interference Lebensohl when playing weak NT and systems on/stolen bid if playing strong NT.|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|In this case, Ira made a Lebensohl 2N bid, which is a method for getting us to compete to the 3 level. Had ally passed, I would have bid 3@C, and Ira would either pass or correct to the suit he wanted to play in (diamonds in this case.) In that scenario  the auction would go 1N-2@S(Brozel)-2N(Lebensohl)-P-3@C-P-3@DPPP.|

hondo717: |cp||at|Now, should ally bid 3@S? On the one hand, she knows they probably have an 8 card fit at least. On the other hand think she is too weak and too balanced to bid 3@S. Next, the question is, once ally bids 3@S, what should Ira do? If you are playing match points at your local club, where the difference between +110 (making 3@D) and +100 (3@S down 2) is significant, ira should consider doubling.|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


NT|^B@2|cp|8|at|
hondo717: |cp||at|However, playing imps, Ira probably should pass, because if they happen to make 3@S doubled, you lose a lot of imps. If they were vulnerable, there is a better case to double, since down 2 is worth a lot (-500), but non-vul not as clear. So pass was fine ira. Ira's lead was ok, a club would have been fine too.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| This is an interesting auction, and will serve as a preview to my upcoming series on slam bidding. I have not yet scheduled it, but I plan on having a series of lessons on slam bidding early next year. Marty Bergen just wrote a book on slam bidding, which is excellent. As soon as I get my copy, I was planning to schedule the lessons  and will use the Bergen book as the text. I was fortunate, along with many other BBO experts, to help him with the editing, and I know it is quite good. However, for now, I would like to use this hand for a brief explanation of slam bidding. The topic I want to cover is cue bidding, more properly known as control bidding.|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| But first, I want to mention a method I play over NT openers, that I think works well in getting to slam which works both on weak and strong NT. I play that a jump to the 3 level in any suit, is a slam try in that suit. It is not a transfer. Meaning 3@C is a club slam try, 3@D a diamond slam try, etc. So, with pam's hand I would bid 3@H. The NT opener, with heart support, starts control bidding. If "no heart support", NT opener bids 3N. The "no heart support" is @HJx or less. Now, let me talk about the 2 methods of control bidding. |
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| Control bidding is a way of discovering whether or not you have first or second round control of a suit. First round control means you can take the first trick in the suit, i.e. you have the ace or a void. Second round control means you can take the 2nd round of the suit, i.e. you have the king or a singleton. There are two methods of control bidding. The first method, which is what most people play, is that once you agree upon a suit, and are interested in slam, you bid the lowest suit in which you have first round control. 

To show my points better I am going to change the bidding in this hand, remove NS hands and I move West. |

PG| ***** 166 ***** |


MB|4c|at|    So, a 4@C control bid by ally would deny the ace of spades and show the ace of clubs. You always bid your cheapest control first. So here spades is cheaper than diamonds -3@S vs 4@D. If you play the first control bid promises first round then without ace of spade she cannot bid 3@S  which leads me to my next point. Let me bring the original hand and bidding back.|

nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is another way to do control bids, which I recommend. As I said, many people play the first time you control bid a suit, that promises first round control -ace or void. However, the more modern way to play control bids is what is known as "Italian control bids." These were invented in conjunction with RKCB (Rome is in Italy, after all, lol.) With "Italian control bids", you bid first or second round control. You may bid an Italian control bid if you are below game in your suit. So, any bid by ally below 4@H is an Italian control bid.|
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The same rules apply in Italian control bids. If ally skips a suit, she is denying first or second round control in that suit.  It turns out by using Italian control bids, you can often stop in game when you discover you have neither first or second round control in one suit. So, let us see how the auction would proceed  here. Again 3@S shows slam interest and the A or K of spades. ally cannot be short, since she opened 1N. If ally had not opened 1N, the 3@S bid could show either the A, K, a void, or singleton.|

at|
Again, incorrect in this hand, if I bid 4@D I am  denying any club control. And ally, knowing that I do not have a club control, can stop at 4@H, since she has no club controls either. That is one of the strengths of Italian cue bids. You often can determine you don't have slam and stop at game, rather than bidding 5 and going down 1. |

After her 4@D bid, I know that we should be in at least a small slam, since we have control of all 4 suits except the club ace. So I now bid 4@S  which shows a spade control. In this case, I know ally can figure out it is the king, because ally already bid the ace.|

at|  which happens frequently. Once your side realizes you have first or 2nd round control of all side suits, you can use RKCB to find out everything you need to know, without worrying about getting too high. The partner who is the "captain" of the hand usually initiates the Blackwood. But, in general, once one of the partners realizes they control all the suits, they can initiate Blackwood. Again, the weak NT has no effect on Italian control bidding nor RKCB.|

3) Take out the sentence "You bid voids and singletons, since they are 2nd round control". Actually, a void is first round control, a singleton is second round control.

4) Change "I now bids 4D" to "I now bid 4D".

ht|e|at|^b@2Control bids are a method some experts use as a way of exploring for slam. They are used to discover if the partnership @E@3has first and/or second round control of the non-trump suit. First round control means the partnership can capture the first trick in the suit (e.g. someone has the ace or a void in the suit). Second round control means the partnership can capture the second trick in the suit (e.g. someone has the king or a singleton in the suit). To bid a small slam, you need first round control of at least 3 suits and second round control of the remaining suit. To bid a grand slam, you need first round control of all suits.

A control bidding sequence is initiated once a partnership has established a game forcing auction and has agreed upon a trump suit. For example, in the sequence |HT|M|CS|1|at|^H {|ia|1hp2np3hp4c|at|}     4@C is a control bid, showing |HT|N|AT|^Sa control in clubs.|HT|Q|AT|^B
Italian control bids are the simplest and most effective way to play control bids. With Italian control bids, the first time a suit is bid, the bidder is guaranteeing either first or second round control in that suit. Also, if the bidder skips a suit, the bidder is denying a control in that suit. So, in the example auction above, the 4@C bid shows first or second round control of clubs, and denies first or second round control of spades.|

nt||bt||mn|        Control Bids - Howard Schutzman        |

ht|e|at|^b@2Italian control bids allow the partnership to quickly discover if they lack control of one suit, and stop at game. For @E@3instance, in the example auction, if the partner of the 4@C bidder does not have a control in spades, he should stop in 4@H, because slam is not possible.

Italian control bids work well in conjunction with Roman Key Card Blackwood. The partnership can usually establish if they have first or second round control in all side suits below the level of 4N. Once control of all side suits is established, 4N can then be used to determine if the partnership has enough key cards to warrant bidding slam. This is typically how Italian control bids are used.

On rare occasions, the partnership may want to skip Roman Key Card Blackwood, particularly if one member of the partnership has strong enough trumps so that he knows there are no trump losers. In that case, the control bidding sequence can continue beyond 4N. Bidding a suit the second time (by either partner, even if the other partner bid the suit first) shows first round control of the suit. The partnership should only skip Blackwood if they know there are no trump losers.

Many experts play a slightly different method of control bids. They play that the first time a suit is bid, it guarantees first round control of the suit. The advantage of this method is that the control bid is less ambiguous. However, the disadvantages are that it is easy for the partnership to get too high before discovering they lack controls in one suit, and it is often not possible to use Roman Key Card Blackwood once a control bidding sequence is initiated. Therefore, I recommend that partnerships use the Italian control bid approach.

Another term some people use for control bid is "cue bid". However, cue bids are also used for many other purposes, such as Michaels, showing a limit raise or better in partner's suit, and asking for a stopper. Control bid is a more precise term.|
