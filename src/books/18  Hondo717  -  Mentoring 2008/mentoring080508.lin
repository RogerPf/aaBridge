^D @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of each board, the viewer would be able to play the hand|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.  

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N|CP|8|AT| 

Please help me improve these movies by sending suggestions to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.|CP||FP||AT|

                                                Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

SB|Smoe you could open your hand.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


SB|EYes. It looked so bare I did not try to add and use Rule 20.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|d|SB|S|SB|E|NT|
^B@2hondo717: moe's double is still takeout, showing less than an opening hand, with heart shortness and support for the other 3 suits. In real life, I think moe should have opened, since his hand meets the rule of 20. However, since he did not, kia should assume he does not have an opening hand, but probably has a singleton or void in hearts. |
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


mb|p|mb|3C|NT|
^B@2hondo717: Now, should aggie continue to compete?  I have a couple of guidelines for competing that are useful. The first is, if we have a nine card fit, you should be comfortable competing to the 3 level. As aggie does not play Bergen Raises here she should bid 3@H if she had four hearts. The other reason to compete to 3@H is if you are short in their suit. And you are, so I think competing is reasonable with your hand aggie. Since you have a very good 2@H bid with good diamonds, you can actually bid 3@D rather than 3@H. This gives me additional information. |
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: We might even get to game, if I happened to have a hand with diamonds and hearts. So you should compete to the 3 level if you have either a 9 card fit, or a singleton or void in the opponents suit. |
PG| ***** 8 ***** |

^B@2hondo717: let's discuss the defense here which could have set the contract. First of all moe, when you win the second diamond, how many diamonds does kia have left and  and how do you know that? |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


AT|
moedraznin: The K was out first round and I have 3 and the dummy has 6 so I should have figured it up.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Yes, between kia and I, we have 4 since we both followed to both rounds, neither of us have any left. Then, had  you lead a diamond back, it turns out kia's six of hearts sets up the contract. If I ruff high, then he scores the 6 on the 4th round of trump, and if I ruff low he overruffs. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: It's not so much whether or not you play a diamond, but more that you need to be aware of the diamond situation. It is a good idea to try and get in the habit of counting out the suits on defense. It can really be helpful, and is not that hard. We all know how to count out trumps. The other suits are no different. |

^B@2hondo717: The bidding was fine. Now, let me discuss the play. First of all, you probably should take the Ace of clubs at trick 1. Since Kia preempted clubs, he has at least six. So, again, as with last hand, you can figure out that moe probably only has one club. If kia has six, and you/dummy have six, that only leaves one for moe. Your heart play was very good and quite tricky. However, before you play the heart, you should play the K of diamonds. If the heart play works, you can throw a club on the ace of diamonds. This is just a matter of planning out the hand, as best you can. |
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


AT|
^B@2delcod1: How to get to the Ace @d? |
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: On the surface, you should be down, losing 2 spades, 2 clubs, and a heart. You cannot legitimately get to the Ace of diamonds. However, you did manage to fool moe with your low heart play, and get to the board with the J of hearts. So, had you cashed your K of diamonds before playing the heart, you might have swindled moe, and got to cash your ace of diamonds. Anyway, it is usually down 1. |
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


AT|
moedraznin: I was expecting Kia to over take and lead back. |
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Well, kia doesn't know if you have one or two clubs. his duck was correct. |
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT|
^B@2moedraznin: Would I lead the J with 2? |
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: Yes, high low from 2, low from 3. Now to the next board.|

^B@2hondo717: Today's theme is counting. In the first two hands, we counted a suit. In this hand, we counted our tricks on defense. On defense, try to visualize how you are going to beat the hand. Sometimes you need to play passively, and try not to give tricks away. Other times, like on this hand, you have to play aggressively, and set up your tricks before declarer gets rid of his losers. You must always think about what are the possibilities for beating the hand.|

^B@2hondo717: In response to 2@C opening I recommend 2@D waiting. If you bid 2@H, 2@S, 3@C, or 3@D, that shows a 5+ card suit with 2 of the top 3 honors. If you want to play 2@H to show a bust (a bust is defined as having no Aces or Kings, not a specific number of HCP), you can play 2NT which shows a 5+ card heart suit with two of the top 3 honors. I personally like to play 2@H showing a bust, but some of my partners find it confusing that 2N is then used to show hearts. (I don't understand why that is so confusing.)|
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: moe cannot pass below game. However, kia, once you realize moe has a bust, you probably should pass 4 diamonds, as it is unlikely you can make 5 opposite a bust. |

^B@2hondo717: An unusual auction. It is rare that there is interference over 2@C, but I will discuss one way of handling it. The way some experts handle it is counter intuitive. A pass by me is interpreted as a "waiting bid" same as if I had bid 2@D had pam passed. And a double by me is a bust, saying I have a bad hand, with no aces or kings. So, had Ira and I been playing that a double by me over interference shows a bust, I would have doubled, since I have no aces or kings. The reason for this treatment is that with a bust, the 2@C doubler may decide to leave the double in, if he feels that it is more likely that the overcaller will go down than we can make game. |
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: This is a little known treatment, but interesting to discuss. Now, once Ira bids 2N, we are in a normal 2N auction. 3@C is Stayman, 3@D is a heart transfer, etc. One other small comment about the defense. |
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


AT|
xfco: is this called D0P1? |
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: No, D0P1 is something else, which I will discuss in a minute. Now, back to defense. joy, since the 9@S is probably pam's highest spade, you should play low on the first spade. By playing the K, you set up 4 spade tricks for Ira. Had you ducked, Ira would only have 3 spade tricks, because your 87 would prevent the 4th spade trick. |
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: So, every defender should try and visualize the cards distribution and play accordingly. 

Now back to D0P1 which is a convention that has to do with interference over 4NT Blackwood. It stands for "double with zero, pass with one" (don't ask me how that follows, but that is what it stands for.) So, if over 4NT Blackwood, the opponents interfere, responder to 4NT would double with zero key cards, pass with one. Next board unless you wish to play the hand double dummy.|

^B@2hondo717: The auction had some interesting points. I could and perhaps should bid 2@H rather than 1@H. Then, Ira has a problem over 2@D. He was 11 HCP, which is a bit too much for a simple raise. So one could make a case that he should bid 3@D. However, there are several negatives to that bid. First, that tends to show 4 card support, and he only has 3 card support. Second he is 4-3-3-3.  I tend to subtract a point or two from my hand for that distribution. And finally, his Q of diamonds and K of clubs may not be worth much, as those are suits the opponents have bid. So, although a 3@D bid is not unreasonable, neither is a 2@H bid. |
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Ira has another problem over 3@C bid. He made a slight underbid at his first opportunity. Now, however, he has some good defense against 3@C. The club and diamond honors and club length, negatives for declaring, are positives on defense. And, by the law of total tricks, Ira can only count on 8 trumps between the two hands so, I think a pass would have been better. Having said that, I would have bid 3@H with my hand. There are two reasons for that. |
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: First, I know we have a 9 card fit and second I have a singleton club. Either of those reasons are enough for me to bid 3@H. Thus, when deciding whether or not to compete, I suggest you use my guidelines of trump length and shortness in the opponents suit. Let us go to the next board.|

hondo717: Now, one comment on this trick. A club back was ok joy. However, you should lead a low club back. There is no holding I can have where the Q of clubs is necessary. Particularly since pam bid clubs. at least make her guess. Let me explain further. |
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


NT|
^B@2honodo717: It is true that it is almost always right to lead high from a doubleton. However, you also need to think about what you are trying to accomplish when you lead a suit. In this particular case, we already had 2 tricks and joy was trying to establish 2 more tricks. I might have led a heart with her hand. But, she decided to lead a club, which was not unreasonable. Given that decision, she is trying to take 2 tricks. So, what holdings in my hand would allow her to do so? If she leads the Q, even if I have the Ace, she will be establishing the club suit for declarer. |
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: On the other hand, if you lead low, at least you give declarer a guess as to whether to play the K or J (if an expert led a low club, there would be no way of knowing whether he had the A or Q, because an expert would lead low from either holding). So, given joy decides to lead clubs, the low club has to be right in that it gives the defense the best chance for taking 2 club tricks. OK let us resume the play. |

^B@2hondo717: Lots to talk about, both bidding and play. First the bidding. Let me discuss my philosophy about 3rd seat openings. Some people play that they can open light in 3rd seat. That is an historical artifact. Up to 15 years ago, most experts played sound opening bids. They would not open the bidding in first or second seat unless they had a solid 13 points at least. However, many of the younger players were cleaning their clocks by opening the bidding light. They never got a chance to get into the auction, because by the time it got around to them again, the auction was often at the 3 level. |
PG| ***** 140 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Also, one of the side effects of sound openings is that third and fourth seat had to open light because otherwise, it was possible that they would miss game. However, the rule of 20 came along and eliminated the concept of sound openers. Thus, the need for light openers went away, because there was no chance of missing game. I personally do not play light openers, because then it is hard for pard to judge how high to bid. After all said, I think 2@D is a better opening bid with joy's hand particularly since I am a passed hand. And if joy opens 2@D, I will bid 3@D over 2@S, which makes it harder to reach 4 spades. |
PG| ***** 141 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Now, to the rest of the auction. 1@S and 2@D are both good bids. However, once pam hears the 2@D bid, she has a good enough hand to bid 4@S, so she should just bid it. You were not consistent pam. If you were planning to bid 4@S over Ira's 3@S response to 3@C, you might as well just bid it immediately. It is ok to bid 3@C if you felt you only had an invitational hand, but you need to decide before you bid 3@C. We can go to the next board unless you wish to play the hand double dummy.|

^B@2hondo717: I think a better bid by aggie would have been 2N. She has a very good hard stopper, and can show her points that way.That allows kia to judge whether or not to bid more, and, in general, place the contract. Just like you should open 1N whenever possible, you should overcall a strong NT when possible. Note that unlike a 1NT balance (i.e. if moe had opened 1H and aggie hand bid 1N), which shows 11-14, a 2N bid, even in balancing position shows a strong NT, probably even at least 16. If you wait for hands with 20 points to balance 2N, you will never bid 2N. A 2N overcall or balance over a weak 2 shows a strong NT, but probably not a bad 15. |

^B@2hondo717: Most of the time you will get an extra diamond. If you start with the AK, you will take 3 diamond tricks any time the Q or 10 drops, or they are 3-3. Also, you have hoped the club and spade finesses work. Unfortunately, there was little hope for a ninth trick, unless we misdefend (such as giving you an extra heart.) You should start the diamonds right away. You ended up playing it correctly, it's just the order in which you played it was slightly off. |

^B@2hondo717: Now, let me discuss transfer auctions. First of all, let me discuss the difference between bidding Texas (transferring at the 4 level) and Jacoby (transferring at the lower level) and then jumping to 4. In general, if you are absolutely sure you want to play in exactly 4 of a major, you use a Texas transfer; 4@D is a transfer to 4@H, and 4@H is a transfer to 4@S. So, on this hand, Moe was sure we should play in 4@S, so he should have bid 4@H. If you do a Jacoby transfer (3@H on this auction, 2@H if I had opened 1N), and then jump to 4 of the major, that is a mild slam try. |
PG| ***** 182 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Basically, Texas Transfer is used to play exactly in game, Jacoby followed by a jump to 4 is used as a mild slam try. I will usually super accept with 4 trumps since my hand is pretty limited as it is (20-21.) I super accept in case that would get moe excited and tells him to look for slam when appropriate. some experts super accept when their 1NT is 16 or 17. I sometimes do it with 15 if I like my hand (good trumps and/or lots of aces and Kings and some intermediates.) In general, my super accept denies a minimum 15. Next board is coming next.|

^B@2hondo717: I suggest you always open 1N with any balanced 15-17, even with a 5 card major. Otherwise, you have an awkward rebid over my 1N forcing. If I only had 5 or 6 points, 2N would be too high. Most experts these days open 1N, even with a 5 card major. And as one of kibs accurately noted it also exposes the strongest hand. 

Now, let me shift to the defense. I have a couple of rules on opening leads that I pretty much always follow. There are no absolutes in bridge, but these are as close as it comes. |
PG| ***** 229 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: You should almost always lead partner's suit. If you don't, you lose the post mortem unless you beat the hand, and your lead was the only way to do it. Second, don't lead the opponents suit. If you follow these two rules, your opening leads will improve. Yes, there are occasional times that they should be broken, but they are very few and far between, so I don't worry about them too much. |

^B@2hondo717: Finally, as to kia's defense. A spade back would have been incorrect. A club is probably a safe lead.

CP||FP||at|
^D@2hondo717: kia wants to know how could he judge leading back a diamond rather than partner's suit @E@3led. It all has to do with the particular hand, and what you are trying to accomplish. Looking at dummy in the last hand, you can visualize that, if you lead a high diamond to knock out the K or Q, if aggie ever gets in and leads a second diamond, you will take 4 diamond tricks. So that is why you should lead a diamond. Later on I will discuss as to which diamond. 

Basically, there are a number of defensive rules that you should follow in general because they work on the vast majority of hands, and they also help partner figure out what you have. On defense, you need to have a plan, just like when you are declarer, and try to visualize how to defeat the contract. It is much harder to do this on defense, but you should practice visualizing defensive strategy the same way that you visualize declarer play. You do that by imagining what kind of holdings declarer and partner need to have (and can reasonably be expected to have) to beat the contract. 

On the last hand, if you think about it, it should be easy to see how you can take 4 diamond tricks if aggie has any entry at all, and at least 2 diamonds.  

Regarding what diamond to lead from kia's hand, first, let me define what an interior sequence is. It is a holding where you have a sequence headed by the J or headed by the 10, and also another higher honor. So, interior sequence holdings are AJ10, KJ10, A109, K109, or Q109 (but NOT QJ10). Originally, if you chose to lead the suit, you would lead the top of the sequence (so, J from AJ0 or 10 from Q109 for example). And many people still play that.|

CP||FP||at|
^D@2However, only on OPENING LEAD AGAINST NT, some people play what is known as "coded 10s and @E@39s". The problem they are trying to solve is for partner to figure out whether or not you have a higher honor. Using the method I just described, you would also lead J from J10 and no higher honor, and 10 from 109 and no higher honor, so partner could not tell whether or not you had a higher honor.. The solution is to play the lead of a 10 or 9 shows zero or two higher honors. So, from AJ10 or KJ10, against NT, you would lead the 10, and from A109, K109, and Q109 you would lead the 9. Note that you would also lead the 10 from 109 and the 9 from 98 with no higher honors. So, how does that help? Well, first of all, if partner leads the J, you know he has  no higher honor (some people call that "J denies"). Second, if partner leads the 10, and you can see the J, then partner can't have a higher honor (because from AJ10 or KJ10 partner would have led the 10, but since you can see the J, partner can't have that holding). Similarly, if partner leads the 9 and you can see the 10, you know partner was leading from 98 with no higher honors. Note that saying "10 or 9 shows zero or two higher honors" is correct, but insufficient. Some people mistakenly lead 10 from QJ10 (you do have two higher honors), but from that sequence you lead Q (the top of the sequence). You only lead a coded 10 or 9 from a broken sequence.

Unless you are really in love with coded 10s and 9s, I suggest you lead top of all sequences, interior or not, and forget about coded 10s and 9s for the moment. Once you get used to top of sequences, you can switch to coded 10s and 9s if you like.

On the particular hand in question, Kia was not on opening lead, so coded 10s and 9s did not apply (assuming you even played them). Since you could see the KQ in dummy, the lead of the J actually provided more information than the lead of the 10. If Kia had led the 10, you should assume he does not have the J.

                  THE END|
