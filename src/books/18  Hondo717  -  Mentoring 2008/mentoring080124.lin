^d @e@2What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring  sessions with his recommendations @E@3and comments to his mentees which are  condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. We meet twice a week at BIL. His third session is on Tuesdays at Club BBO_IAC.|CP|8|AT|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or beauty of the graphics.  When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  For teaching purpose unlike the live play here you see all four hands. Further, at the end of most boards, if not all, the viewer would be able to play the hand double dummy or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. You can begin when |cp|8|at|^*BDouble D PLAY^*N|CP||FP||at| is shown at the right lower corner of the chat box.

^*BThe links in this file are clickable.  Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|box in the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section.  ^*N|CP|8|AT| 

Please help me improve these movies by sending suggestions to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.|CP||FP||AT|

                                                Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

^B@2hondo717: Generally speaking, because 1N is such a precise bid, I tend to favor being fairly disciplined about it.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


SB|S|mb|3D|AT|

hondo717: 3@D is new minor forcing kia. My bid asks whether or not you have 4 hearts and/or 3@S. Think of NMF as a form of stayman, except since responder has already bid a major, you only need 3 card support for that major.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


mb|p|mb|3S|AT|
^B@2 hondo717: And your bid is correct because you have three spades.|

pg| ***** 10 ***** |


NT|
^B@2hondo717: Notice with 5/5 in the majors, I bid spades then hearts, rather than up the line. With 4 hearts and 4 spades, you respond 1H after one of a minor opening. With 5/4 in the majors, you bid your 5 card major  and with 5/5 in the majors, you bid 1@S, assuming you are willing to bid 2@H over partner's rebid. If you are not willing to rebid 2@H, then you should bid 1@H with 5/5 to give partner a chance to bid spades.|

NT|
^B@2hondo717: My plan was to lose 1 heart, 1 spade and 1 club. The lead was ok, although I could make a case for a trump or a diamond also. There are 2 reasons to lead trump. The most common reason is that declarer has bid 2 suits, and partner has shown a preference for one, which infers shortness in the other one. In that case, it is quite possible declarer will be ruffing the other suit, so a trump lead cuts down on the ruffs. An example auction would be 1@D-1@H  :  1@S-2@D    So declarer is likely ruffing spades. The other reason is when you have no other good lead, and are looking for a relatively safe one.|

PG| ***** 25 ***** |


SB|NHow many Ds should she have please?|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


SB|S5 is preferable, but somtimes you have to do it with 4.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


mb|p|NT|
^B@2hondo717: Now, if I had a heart raise, I would double 2H, saying deb "stole" my bid. So my pass implies I do not have heart support, or I have a real bad hand, or both. As you get better, it is important you take inferences from what is not bid as well as what is bid. For example, deb did not make a negative double, so she does not have pades.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


SB|N|SB|S|SB|WI have to guess here howard.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: How about NT to show your hearts terry. Otherwise, you might miss a NT contract, deb is not likely to have hearts, so you should show your hearts.|

^B@2hondo717: You played that very well terry, and would have done so even without an explicit plan. but sometimes planning helps in more difficult contracts. Now, let me discuss deb's lack of opening bid. I know you miscounted deb. But had you been missing one of your jacks, and only had 12HCP, I think it best to open your hand. It still meets the rule of 20 (12 HCP plus 8 clubs/diamonds.) And, as it turns out, the J of spades was more valuable than the J of diamonds, so you never know for sure.|

^B@2hondo717: deb is showing a hand with slam interest in hearts. If she just had a min opener, she would simply have bid 4H over 1@H. By using 4SF she is showing a stronger @h.|

Pear: I personally have no interrest in salm since I dont believe we have the points OR the shape.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |

hondo717: Fine, it is ok for you to bid 4@H then. Part of her purpose is a question, to see how good your hand is, and you have shown a min, which is what you have.|

^B@2hondo717: So, that hand was somewhat harder than it looked. The reason it was harder is that, although terry had only 2 apparent losers, he also needed to count his winners. Or at least realize, that although he only had one apparent club loser, he had to ruff 3 clubs in dummy for that to be true.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


AT|
nome: Now that I can see the four hands I could have given you a second ruff if you had played a @C right after the first ruff. |
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


AT|
hondo717: That is true, assuming I play you for the K of clubs. And that would have been a good aggressive play on my part.|

^B@2hondo717: Now, if we were not vul, I would probably bid 3@D. More often than not, when pard opens 1 of a minor, he has at least a 4 card suit, so 3@D would likely work out ok  but vul, the risk is too great.|

^d@e@2Whether aristocrat, lawyer, farmer, or shopkeeper fifty–six ordinary men achieved something extra- @E@3ordinary when the Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776. The British called the document treasonous and the signatories traitors – singing it was an act punishable by death. Some signers lost their home in the ensuing Revolutionary War. Others were left without their livelihood. All had put their lives on the line.

The Declaration wasn’t just a blueprint for revolution; it helped to secure the future of the United States and became the mission statement for world democracy. We’re all familiar with the famous signers of the Declaration. Here, as a weekly series we will tell you about some of the lesser-known, ordinary heroes who declared our nation’s future. This week we have two more. |cp|8|FP|2|at|

hondo717: You defended this well terry.  Further, terry showed good restraint in not bidding, although 1N over 1@S would not be terrible, but I like pass better. deb has a 1@H bid by the rule of 20, but tactically, she can consider opening 2@H, particularly in 3rd seat. As far as the defense goes, terry did well to play the 10 of diamonds, and play a trump to get rid of the club ruff. All in all, our side did well on this hand. Here, some people play a convention known as a "sandwich" NT. If both opps have bid, as in this case, and you play the sandwich NT, it shows the other 2 suits, and less than an opening hand. I dont particularly recommend the sandwich NT.|

hondo717: Ok, nice going. First my weak 2. As most of you know by now, I think it is fine to open a weak 2 with an outside 4 card major, but that is my style, and many experts do not agree. My reasoning is that I think the value of the preempt far outweighs the occasional time when you might miss a game with a 4-4 fit. But, you need to decide for yourself whether or not to do it, and some experts will violently disagree with me.|

Pear: Howard I have a question about that ... IF I know that you will bid a weak2 with a 4 card major can I bid the OTHER major with an opening hand?|
PG| ***** 140 ***** |


AT|  hondo717: You should never bid a 4 card major over a weak 2 because it is rare that I will have a 4 card major.|

debs 3 club bid was fine, but you could make a case for her to bid 4@C or even 5@C. And kia might consider 3N rather than 4@C  which makes as well. In fact, 3N is just about cold. So why did you choose 4@C instead of 3N kia?|

hondo717: Sometimes you just have to hope pard has a suit stopped, and it is still likely you will get a heart lead. 3N is almost always easier than 5 of a minor. Basically, if you bid over an opps weak 2, you are showing a pretty good hand.|

hondo717: You had a plan, and then you changed your mind. As a result, you almost went down, intead of making 5. kia made a great play in ducking the A of diamonds, experts do that all the time. It's ok, in real life you probably would have made 5. Now, let me talk about opening leads vs NT. Why did you choose a heart deb?|
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


AT|
Badmonster: I looked at my long suit, and my hand. I had very few entries.  It seemed, in light of how you guys just bid nt, that a major suit lead might be working. So you were hoping to hit kia's suit. So, I tried to find p's suit.|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


NT|
hondo717: Yes, many people advocate leading a major against NT especially if stayman has not been bid.  But I take a much simpler approach, 4th from longest and strongest. I find over the long run it works best. In this case a diamond was the best lead. Assuming partner has not bid a suit, you should lead 4th from your longest and strongest.
Unless of course that suit has been bid by the opps, in that case pick your next best suit.  The first priority, however, is to lead the suit which partner has bid or overcalled. In the long run, I have found 4th best works well.

hondo717: Well, unless you have reason to believe pard has a long suit, he could have your suit, be an optimist. I can't tell you the number of times I have led low from 9xxxx and partner has AK and we run 5 tricks. Also, it saves wear and tear on the brain, and pard knows you are consistent at least.|

hondo717: Excellent defense. Your bidding was fine, just bad breaks and a misfit. The point of this hand was for kia to realize it was a misfit and pass. I generally advocate aggressive bidding. However, in this case kia can figure out the hand is a misfit. When the hand is a misfit, you would rather have the opps go down than you go down.|
