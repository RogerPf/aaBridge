^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

We hope that the on spot reporting, though more demanding of our resources, would be more useful. Please drop us a line with your comments. You may prefer the old fashion way!|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Hopefully, many of you noticed that the 2H bid was a reverse, showing at least 16 or so points, often more. A reverse is forcing. However, since a reverse can be done with as little as 16 points, it is not game forcing. But most people play it is forcing until at least 2N. Some people play it is simply a 1 round force. The difficulty with reverse auctions is it is not clear who is "captain" of the auction. On most auctions, responder is captain. Responder makes forcing bids and determines whether or not to bid game.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On reverse auctions, it is not clear who is in charge. If responder has 10+ points, then responder knows their side should be in game. Similarly, if opener has 18+, then opener knows their side has game. When responder has less than 9, then responder is not sure about game. Similarly, if opener has less than 18, opener is not sure. On this hand, Joan should make sure they are in a game force whereas Stan is not sure.|

mb|p|mb|2S|cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Stan made the correct bid of 2S showing a rebiddable spade suit.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


mb|p|mb|3S|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Joan's 3S bid is a bit dangerous, because it is invitational, not forcing and she knows they have points for game.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


mb|p|mb|4S|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Fortunately, once Stan heard about the spade support he was able to bid game. This hand illustrates why bidding over reverses is very difficult. However, the final contract was good.|

xXx_Cpt: Is there an upper limit on Stan's 2S?|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you play that reverses are forcing to at least 2N, then not strictly. However, with a game forcing hand and really good spades, responder can bid 3S. Stan is very close to a 3S bid. If he just had the S10, I would have bid 3S with his hand instead of 2S. But 2S is okay here.|

guelphdad: How does Joan bid her 4 card major after opening one of minors and not having 16+ points?|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good question. For example in this hand, had the points were less than 16 then Joan cannot bid 2H. That is a flaw in standard bidding. It is possible to occasionally lose the heart suit, when responder has 5 spades, 4 hearts and a weak hand. |CP|8|AT|If Joan had the same distribution but only 13 points or so, she would either have to bid 2D or 1N and suppress the hearts|CP||AT|. Remember, you can only reverse with at least 16 points or so.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now as to the play. Stan did well to play 3 rounds of spades. Normally, when the only trump out is high, there is no reason to draw it. Just let opponent ruff in whenever they want. However, in this case, Stan has a problem in clubs. He could easily have 3 club losers if Ann ever got in, and I had the Ace of clubs. What he can do is draw my last spade then there is no danger. If I lead a club, then the club King will take a trick. And if I lead a red suit, he is all set. That turns out to be the best play. Fortunately, on this hand Ann had the Ace of clubs, so Stan was all set. In order to show you let me go back to after trick 5.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, Stan's double should show 4 hearts. Sometimes if you have a pretty strong hand and only 3 hearts, you can lie and double. But since Stan only had a minimal opener, without 4 hearts, I would have passed with his hand. With 4 hearts and 12 points I would double.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's count Joan's declarer points, assuming a 9 card fit. She has 9 HCP, two points for two 5-card suits, four points for the void and one point for an outside 4+ card suit (clubs). That is 16 declarer points which is more than enough to bid 4H. Here, of course Stan only had 3 hearts, but that is not Joan's problem.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, lets talk about the play. Joan should assume a spade loser, 1 club loser possibly and at most 2 heart losers. So, if she can manage to eliminate either a club or heart loser she can make 3. As declarer, I would win the spade Ace right away and play the DA, pitching a spade. Why would I pitch a spade? Because that eliminates me having to ruff a spade in dummy. The club pitch is not useful. Then I would take the club finesse, but start with the Queen. When that wins, do it again. South would ruff, But, all South gets is 3 heart tricks and one spade, and I make 3.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I have a problem. I chose not to bid 2H because I had weak 3 card support. But letting them play at the 2 level with an 8 card fit is not good. We could have an 8 card heart fit. However, it is more likely pard has 2 clubs than 5 hearts. I wasn't sure if Stan played support doubles. If we played support doubles, then I could have doubled rather than bidding 2C. Playing support doubles, if the auction went 1C-P-1H-1S-dbl, my double is a "support double" showing 3 hearts. Then, now I would not have a problem. Here, I can even stand Stan having say the singleton 9 of clubs, so 3C seems best.|

Some people play that you need at least 16 HCP to do that, so they won't jump to 3 with 4 card support and 15. But I tend to jump to 3 as a law of total tricks bid, unless I have a bad hand with lots of quacks. I will give an undo.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Stan just made a very nice play. I am end played. If I lead a diamond, Stan will get his diamond King. And if I lead a club (or heart), Stan gets a ruff and sluff. What Stan did is known as an elimination end play. He strips all the side suits, and throws in the non-dangerous hand with the problem suit. I don't expect you to always see these end plays. But, what you can learn is the following. If you eliminate suits from both hands before throwing in the opponents you give them less options as to what to lead. And that is a good thing. So, whenever you have to lose a trick to the opponents, if you can eliminate some other side suit first, it is good to do so.|

However, as I get older I become more persistent and keep writing on the sand--reviewing the material over and over. This week I have a portion of chapter IX from WATSON's Classic Book on ^*IThe Play of the Hand at Bridge^*N. It is on control and hold-up. I hope you enjoy reading it.

ht|e|fp||at|^B@2^Y@3H|FP||AT|aving gone through a necessary amount of groundwork in suit establishment, you are now ready to return to a subject which was but touched upon in the first chapter, namely, the control of a suit.

In the handling of no-trump hands, which permits of considerable flexibility, you have learned that it is important to establish a suit netting you a profitable number of tricks before leading out your good cards without any purpose in view. So far, however, you have not been confronted with a hand in which you have been unable to retain control of the adverse suit which might be established against you. To make the preliminary explanation simpler, you were deliberately given example hands in which a suit was attacked by the Opponents, but in which you were also provided with adequate defensive units to circumvent the attack.|
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


AT|

Unfortunately, in playing Contract Bridge you will have to handle whatever cards fate deals out to you, and you can by no means expect to have double control cards in every suit in the majority of hands you will get. Very frequently you will find yourself with but one defensive time unit in one of your suits, and you will be annoyed when your Opponents are usually discerning enough to choose that suit for their immediate attack!|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


AT|

Naturally, if you have but one defensive unit against them, the Opponents will ultimately establish their suit in spite of everything you can do, especially if they keep on leading it. |

{
^-You can minimize the danger to some extent by keeping the Opponents from getting the lead.          
If you cannot keep both Opponents out of the lead,
you can try to confine the lead to one Opponent and 
hope that he is the one who does not hold the established cards
in the suit you fear.

CP||NT||
HT|E|FP||AT|^B@2^Y@3I|FP||AT|t may usually be taken for granted that the player who opens a suit (that is, the player who first leads that suit) is the one who holds the greater length in it. Later you will have to remember that this rule is not invariable, but just now let us assume that it is always true. Your object will then be to hold on to your controlling card in that suit until there is a fairly good chance that the Opponent who is not leading the suit will be exhausted of it. Then, if you have to give up the lead, you will try to let that Opponent have it who quite probably has no cards left of his partner's suit to lead to him. This sort of play is called, in Bridge language, |CP|8|FP|2|AT|the hold-up|CP||FP||AT|, because you refuse to play ("hold up") the controlling card until you have to play it. The following deal illustrates the successful use of the hold-up:|

East plays the Queen, hoping to force your Ace. The weakest point in your armor is being attacked: your club Ace is your only stopper (controlling card) in that suit, but you have two or more controlling cards in each of the other suits. You cannot afford to release the Ace of clubs immediately, for you do not have enough high cards to make your contract in the teeth of an established club suit against you. |
pg| ***** 162 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The moment you lose the lead, when your club Ace is gone, the Opponents will cash in you have no idea how many club tricks (at the worst, as many as 6). Meanwhile you earnestly desire to set up some diamond tricks on your own behalf, and you can do this by forcing out the adverse Ace. But you cannot take your club Ace and then let an adversary take his diamond Ace, for he will surely come right back with a club. If the clubs are divided 4-2 (there are six outstanding), the Opponents will then make 4 club tricks and 1 diamond trick -enough to set your contract.|
pg| ***** 163 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Though it is true that if the adverse clubs were originally split 4-4, the loss of 3 club tricks and 1 diamond trick will not defeat your contract, you have no right to expect such a favorable break in the club suit. The fact that West has opened the suit suggests that he has fair length in it, probably five cards. Indeed, if West has five clubs, and his partner the other three, there is a way you can nip the plans of your Opponent in the bud. You have only to refuse to win the first two rounds of clubs, holding up your Ace until the third round. |
pg| ***** 164 ***** |


NT|^B@2
By doing this, you wait until East is exhausted of clubs before you release control, so that, if East also has the diamond Ace, he will not be able to lead a club to his partner when he gets the lead with that sure winner. In fact, if East has no clubs at that time, he will have to lead a suit in which you have the controlling cards.|

Whichever Opponent wins, the suit is continued. Now East has to play his last club, and you have to play your Ace. On this third round, incidentally, you discard a heart from Dummy's hand.

The hold-up is one of the simplest bits of strategy in the play of any hand, but it is also one of the most important plays in any good player's repertoire.

In the two examples just given, the hold-up was effective because you held only one possible stopper in the suit attacked by the Opponents. Sometimes the suit opened against you is one in which you hold the Ace accompanied by certain lower cards which can be developed if you do not employ the hold-up, but which will be valueless if you hold up the Ace.

Your main object should be, instead, to try to establish certain winners before you do any fooling around with possible winners. After all, good though a finesse may be in the proper time and place, it cannot compare with the certainty of developing tricks by establishing a suit along lines of play which are almost sure to succeed.|

Look, for instance, at your diamond holding. If you concede 2 tricks to the Opponents for their Ace and King, you establish 3 tricks in the suit. |

You must also lose the King and Queen of spades, and that will make 4 tricks for the Opponents. However, you are certain of winning the fourth round of spades, so that if the spades are divided adversely 4-3 you can lose no more than 2 spade tricks. Has the finessing possibility any advantage over developing diamonds? None. Indeed, even if both finesses succeed, they will not assure you of your contract, and it will still be necessary to attack the diamond suit. The best procedure is clearly to make the diamond attack without delay.|

West's lead holds the trick. You are now perfectly content with the developments, for you know that there is only one spade outstanding, and your Ten will beat it. It makes no difference what West decides to lead.|

With 7 tricks still to be made, you are certain of winning 2 club tricks, 3 diamond tricks, and 2 heart tricks -your contract.|

Suppose that, instead of playing as just recommended, you decide the spade suit is dangerous and that you must take the club and heart finesses at once. |

You have only a one-way finesse, for you cannot lead the Jack blindly without having the Ten to back it up. You might lead the King of clubs from your own hand and follow it with a low club, finessing the Jack on the second round if West plays low. It so happens that this will hold the trick and you can turn your attention to hearts. By following the same procedure here, the Jack will lose to West's Queen. This would be enough to set your contract 1 trick, for East and West still hold the King and Queen of spades and the Ace and King of diamonds against you, making 5 tricks won by your Opponents.|

Suppose you refuse to win the Jack of spades on the first trick with your Ace. Notice how the play develops trick by trick:|

West's King holds the trick. At the sixth trick, East and West have taken 3 spade tricks and 2 diamond tricks, enough to defeat South's contract by 1 trick. In other words, your refusal, as South, to promote your lower honors immediately has resulted in the loss of your contract.|
