^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First, let's talk about the bidding. I recommend playing DONT over 1NT openers with an appropriate hand. East has an appropriate hand. Playing DONT, there are 2 choices of what to bid with the hand. If you decide to treat the hand as a single suited club hand, you can double, showing a single suit (playing DONT). And if you decide to treat it as a 2 suited hand, you can bid 2C showing clubs and another suit. I would choose 2C, mostly because I want to get my club suit in. In any case I would definitely compete over 1N with the East hand.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^^Y@3*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to the play. The club lead was fine. As to whether East should shift. Unless there is a good reason to think diamonds is the appropriate shift, that would be my last choice of what to play at trick 2. If you want to play a "passive" defense, not giving anything away, a second club is fine. Many people are reluctant to play a suit that declarer can ruff, but there is no reason to be afraid of doing that. At worst it gives nothing away (as on this hand), and sometimes (on other hands) it shortens declarer's trumps prematurely. So, never be reluctant to give declarer a ruff unless there is a better play.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, with East's hand and the @HQ in dummy, I would lead the @HJ at trick 2. Some people play that with a singleton in dummy, West should do a suit preference discard. If you play that, then a low club discard would be a suit preference for diamonds, and a high club a suit preference for hearts. And East tells me that is what was assumed, which accounts for the diamond shift. However, I don't particularly care for that signaling. On many hands, such as this one, West has preference for neither suit.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next, let me address how to play Qxx opposite Axx. Many students play the Queen, as Sandy did but I call that a "practice finesse." The reason for that is, even if it works, it does not gain you a trick. The only way to legitimately take two tricks in the suit is to lead low towards the Queen and hope East has the King. Leading the Queen guarantees two heart losers against proper defense.|

TwstofLime: What constitutes a single suited hand?|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I play any suit which you would overcall at the 2 level can be treated as a single suit. certainly a 5-card suit with 2 of the top 3 honors qualifies. But, I would say most people feel you should have a six card suit.|

^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you can see, as often is the case, the 2D bid gives me a problem. If I double, partner is likely to bid hearts. But if I bid 3C, then we might miss a spade fit.  I have found in general, with 6-4 hands, bidding your six card suit works best. The other reason to not worry as much about a 4-4 fit is often, when someone preempts, the trump suit breaks 4-1 and NT is often better.|

^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|An interesting hand. I already discussed why I bid 3C rather than doubling.  West has a clear 3D bid. Anytime your partner opens a weak-2, and you have 3 or more cards in their suit, and 5+ points, you should raise to 3. That is based on the law of total tricks which says you can bid to the level of the number of trumps you have. Here, since West knows they have 9 diamonds, 3D is a safe bid. Always raise to 3 with 3-card support. The only exception is when you have a real good hand and think game is a possibility. Then you can explore with 2N or a new suit. On a majority of hands, however,  raise to 3 with 3-card support. This is known as "furthering the preempt." It is particularly effective had I passed.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to Sandy's bid. It worked out well, but I am not sure I would have bid 3N with her hand. I rate to have a singleton diamond on this auction because Sandy has 3 and they have shown a 9 card fit. Unless I have the DA or DK, or East has both, Sandy rates to lose 6 diamonds off the top. However "no guts no glory" as they say, lol. And Sandy got the glory on this hand. I am not sure Sandy has any good bid. It also turns out that, although East has a clear diamond lead. Had she chosen to lead a heart, 3N is down 1, losing 4 hearts and a diamond. However, that is really not likely nor recommended. Finally, note that, although we have a 4-4 spade fit, we do get a 4-1 break.|

^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Many would open my hand in 3rd seat, because opening light is a popular approach. However, I am strictly a rule of 20 person myself. I find that if I open light, particularly with many of my aggressive partners, we end up getting too high. So, my style is only to open in all seats if I meet the rule of 20. I am not saying that is what you should do, but just that is what I do.  I have discussed this with Marty Bergen, and he respectfully but violently disagrees with me. But I have had good results, particularly on pass outs, so I am sticking to my guns on this issue :).|

^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, should Mei ann bid. Certainly because I am a passed hand, she knows our side does not have game. However, because it is unlikely that the opponents will let us play at the one level, I would bid 2 hearts with her hand just to make it more difficult for them to come in.|

^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Marge has a difficult decision once Mei ann passes. It is rarely a good idea to let them play at the one level and she knows we have at least a 7 card fit, because Ginny, having opened 1C, is very unlikely to have 5 hearts. So, I would go with the "if they have a fit, we have a fit" rule and bid 2C with Marge's hand. I know many would be worried about playing in a 3-3 fit. But, remember, in 85+% of the time, when partner opens a minor they have at least 4. Therefore, if put to a guess, assume partner has 4 clubs at least.|

^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, we discussed the bidding. As to the play, you noticed I disdained the spade finesse because I was assuming, given Marge's pass and given she had the @CA, that Ginny had the @SK. If Marge had both the @SK and @CA she would not have passed 1C. This is another example of where you need to pay attention to the bidding to get clues on how to play the hand. So, I was hoping to get 2 diamond pitches on spades by playing Ace and another spade.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And notice, I also only drew 2 rounds of trump rather than taking the finesse. Because I needed to ruff a club in dummy with the 3rd trump, and I was willing to lose a heart while I pitched a diamond loser. There are many times when you are missing 5 trumps to the Queen where you simply draw 2 rounds, deciding to lose the Queen, so you can use your trumps for ruffing losers.|

^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, lets discuss bidding over 1x-p-2x. First, lets assume it goes 1x-p-2x-p-p. In this case Mei ann has a clear double. Yes, she has a problem if Marge bids clubs. But, remember, "if they have a fit, you have a fit." So, because Ginny is a passed hand, and if Marge bids 3C, she is sure Marge does not have spades. Therefore, over 1H-P-2H-P-P, Mei ann should double.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, that is a problem Mei ann, however, not a big one because "if they have a fit, you have a fit."|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us say you double, and Marge bids 3C. Then you can bid 3D. You are pretty sure you have a diamond fit and you are not doubling and correcting because you did not bid over 1H. You are simply showing spades and diamonds.|

EddyHaskel: Could West double directly over 1H--with openers.... 3 quick tricks?|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, Eddy, without clubs that is a problem. I sometimes do that, and if partner bids clubs, I pass and say "I owe you a club on the next hand", lol. The original pass by Mei ann was correct. However,  pass is not okay over 2H-P-P.|
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, lets talk about Marty Bergen's OBAR approach. What Marty Bergen recommends is, if it goes 1X-P-2X, the direct seat should strain to balance as well. OBAR means "Over Opponent Bid and Raise." He says you can consider any bid by the direct opponent as a "pre-balance." So, a suit is simply a suit, double is takeout, and he plays 2NT as a minor suit takeout bid, which is the perfect bid for Marge's hand.|
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, playing OBAR, the auction would go 1H-P-2H-2N, showing at least 4-4 in the minors. Here, Mei ann has to remember this is a "pre balance" and not get excited, simply be happy to bid 3D. It turns out 3D makes, losing 2 hearts and 2 clubs. The bottom line is, if it goes 1x-P-2x-p-p, you should strain to bid. letting them play 2 is not going to be a good result.|

@D@D nome: Now, if you wish, you can play this hand double dummy. Lead was the diamond Ace, however, you can choose a different lead. Just click any card from that hand. When finished or if not interested in the double dummy feature please, click the forward arrow to move to the next section. |

^-|HT|f|CP||FP||at|^B@2Bridge information stays with me as long as writing on the sand at the beach. It takes only one soft wave to wash everything away. However, as I get older I become more persistent and keep writing on the sand--reviewing the material over and over. This week I have  a portion of a BBO movie on DONT prepared based on Howard's teaching. You can down load and view the entire award winning movie, humility notwithstanding, from the BIL library or from Howard's web site at ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/##lessons^*N in the tutorial section. BTW, the person who asks the questions is noted with on a (-) which is the source of the humility!|

^-|FP||CS||CP||AT|^b@2^Y@3- Let me clear one important point before we go to other parts. From your instructions, I understand that we always bid the lower ranking of the two suits regardless of the the shape or the strength of each two suits. For example with 2-2-5-4 or a 2-5-2-4 or a 5-2-2-4 the  bid always is 2@C. Is that correct?|
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
hondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As I mentioned, you should usually treat a hand with one four card suit and one 6+ card suit as a single suited hand. On any hand that you choose to treat as 2 suited, DONT requires that you bid your lower ranking suit, even if your higher ranking suit is stronger. |

- Let us shift to partner's response after a DONT bid assuming the next opponent simply passes. Please, tell us what would be partner's response if the auction goes 1NT-D-P ?|
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
hondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over a DONT double (showing a single suited hand), the doubler's partner must bid 2@C. This allows the doubler to bid their suit at the 2 level (or pass if their suit is clubs).|

- Thank you. Now if the auction is 1NT-2@C-P ?|
PG| ***** 99 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
hondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When the DONT bidder bids a suit, showing a 2 suited hand, partner should pass with 3+ card support. Otherwise, partner should bid the next higher suit, to allow the DONT bidder to pass if that is their 2nd suit or to bid their other suit at the 2 level. In the example auction you gave, partner should pass with 3+ clubs, otherwise bid 2@D.

^-|FP||CS||CP||AT|^b@2^Y@3- So far very good. But while back I had a 2-7-1-2 hand and the auction was 1NT-X-P to me and I bid 2@H and was royally roasted. Please comment what would be the correct response when responder to a DONT double has a 7+ card in diamond or heart? Should the response still be 2@C?|
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
hondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Theoretically, you are supposed to bid 2@C over the double. However, with a 7+ card suit of your own, it is permissible to bid your suit. It is more likely that you will be better off in your suit than partner's suit. So, partner should not have complained on that particular hand. |

- Next, I have constructed various auctions pertaining to a two suited DONT bid and the appropriate response. Please comment.|

HT|o|AT|^n@2^Z@3Shows a single suit in spades. There are two bids to show a single suiter in spades. you can either bid two spades directly or you can first double and then correct partners two clubs to two spades based on the strength of the spade holding. |
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


HT|t|cp|8|AT|^c@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First of all, you can have as little as 4/4 and show 2 suits if you have an opening hand or better. Second of all, in general, you should bid 2@S rather than doubling and bidding 2@S. As originally defined, Bergen said 2@S directly was weaker than doubling and bidding 2@S, but I feel the preemptive value of bidding 2@S right away is such that you should always bid 2S when you have spades.|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


AT|

In fact, I play a revised version of DONT. I play 2@H shows a single suited heart hand, rather than hearts and spades. That is because I feel that are more hands where you have a single suited heart hand than a 2 suited heart/spade hand. And 2@H has good preemptive value. Playing this revised version of DONT, to show hearts and spades, you double and correct 2@C to 2@H.|

HT|u|AT|^n@2^Z@3The single suited DONT bids tend to be unilateral, saying partner wants to play in their suit. Therefore, if partner bids 2@S, you should pass regardless of how many spades you have. |
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


HT|y|AT|^C@2^Y@3This is no different than if partner doubles, and you bid 2C, and partner bids another suit. You are required to pass, no matter what you have in partner's suit. |

at|^c@2^Y@3This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I like to have a record representing the sessions as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it. The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. 

Please, notes unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some boards are presented in a closed format. To open any hand click that seat. Another click opens all hands. ^*BThe links in this file are clickable^*N. Simply click it if you wish to visit the site.
