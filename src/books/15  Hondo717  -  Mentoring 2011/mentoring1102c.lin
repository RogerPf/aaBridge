^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay Jackie, suppose the club finesse lost, then you are down and the contract was cold without the club finesse. All you have to do is ruff a diamond, and then you have 1 spade loser, 1 diamond loser. You happen to be lucky here, but you made a cold contract 50%. Just ruff the 3rd diamond, draw trumps, and lose a spade. You will always make 5.|

AT|
Dixie_08: Yes.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Then an opening hand opposite an opening hand should bid game. So, you should bid 2C over 1H, rather than 1S. In fact, some people who play 2 over 1 play that with 4 spades and a 4 card minor you purposely bypass your spade suit and bid your 4 card minor just to establish the game force. I am not suggesting you do that, but on this hand, with 5 clubs and 4 spades, 2 clubs will tend to work better. It establishes the game force, and then when you bid spades, partner will have a good picture of your hand. However, you ended up in a very nice spot, so all is well that ends well. Your 4H bid over 3H was very good Kim. |

lb|*cWhat would be the correct opening lead?^^d9^skt6hj75ckt76d975|nt||pc|D5|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss the opening lead. If I have not supported partner's suit, I lead count. Count is usually more important than attitude when partner has a long suit. So, had Ginny not supported diamonds, the D5 is what I lead. However, since Ginny did support diamonds, Marge knows she has three. In that case Ginny can lead the 9, indicating top of nothing (no diamond honors) because Marge does not need the count, as Ginny has raised diamonds. |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |

pc|d8|lb|*cWhat card should be played here?^^dj^D234JA|pc|DA|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that, Ginny did lead the 5. So, Marge should play the Jack, not the Ace. Generally speaking, you want your aces to capture other honors. Since Marge's Ace-Jack "surrounds" dummy's King-10, Marge should play the Jack. If Ginny has the Queen, it is the right play. And if Ginny does not have the Queen it does not cost anything. So, that is a common situation: where you have Ace-Jack or even Ace-10 and dummy has the King or Queen. Generally speaking you should play the Jack from Ace-Jack or the 10 from Ace-10 or King-10 when dummy has a lower honor.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now lets talk about Kia's play, particularly in the heart suit. In general, he rates to take 2 heart tricks. So, he should finesse Ginny twice. The first time, the best play is to lead low to the 10. That works if Ginny has the Jack. If that doesn't work, then he has to hope that the King is doubleton or the 8 sets up. Even the way he played it he will take two heart tricks. He should pitch a club on the diamond and take a second heart finesse.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, Kia should take the club finesse. There is no downside, and if it works, he gets an extra trick. With proper technique given the lie of the cards and the @DA on the first trick, Kia can actually make 4. However, he had my permission to substitute a struggling starlet for himself in the movie :).|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, first of all this hand shows why it pays to be an aggressive bidder. It is easy to misdefend, and had I let Kia defend as he wanted to, Marge would have made the contract.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


AT|
MarDef: Well, I liked the Ace lead by Kia.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That was my point. Defense is the hardest part of bridge, and even if you are in a contract that should go down, it often makes due to a mistake by the defense.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that, let me review my guidelines for competitive bidding, and explain why Marge should probably not bid 3H. First of all, the primary guideline is the Law of Total Tricks. With an 8 card fit, bid to the 2 level at least, with a 9 card fit ok to bid to the 3 level. There is one other guideline that is important. If the opponents are playing at the 2 level and you know they have at least a 8 card fit: then, even with only an 8 card fit of your own, it is ok to bid to the three level. That is why I bid 3D over 2H. We might not have a 9 card fit, but letting them play at the 2 level in an 8 card fit rarely gets you a good result.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is the one case where you can override the law of total tricks. However, you should not generally bid "3 over 3" unless your hand meets one of the following conditions. a) You know you have a 9 card fit, or b) you have a singleton or void in the opponents suit. Marge had neither, so she should pass 3D. Further, 3D goes down as does 3H --validating the law of total tricks of course assuming no defensive errors. On this hand 3 hearts would have worked out had I not forced the defense to not make an error. But in general my guidelines tend to work well.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well done Marge. Kia had the right idea about trying for slam. He has a great hand. Lets count his Bergen Points. He has 16 HCP. Normally he deducts one for the HK, but since Marge bid hearts he need not deduct 1. He has a total of 19 with 2 length points, 1 quality suit. That puts them in slam range. His best bet at slam is 6 clubs. It is almost always easier to play a slam in a suit than NT. So, if 4C is Gerber that is a reasonable bid. He is a little concerned about diamonds, but without some sophisticated bidding, it is hard to find out about diamonds.|
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, one might argue that since Kia bid 2C, 4C is not Gerber and many people play it that way. Of course, the other problem is if 4C is Gerber he can't stop in 5C because 5C would be a K ask. Therefore, he does have a problem without more sophisticated bidding methods. Nevertheless, it is great realizing his hand had good slam potential.|

bjmue: I would like to review Gerber also sometime.|
PG| ***** 99 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Just to quickly review Gerber. Over a NT opener bid or rebid (either 1N or 2N) if partner jumps to 4C, many people play that as Gerber, asking for Aces. The responses are as follows:
4D = 0 aces (or 4 rarely), 
4H = 1, 
4S = 2, and 
4N = 3.|

The declarer simply takes the opening lead in hand and starts the process of pulling the trumps. It is obvious that there are four trumps missing--QJxx. Your mission is to make sure that you have no trump losers. Do you follow the "eight ever and nine never" directive or you have more elaborate thoughts. For now let us finish this trick.|

^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|Now, is the moment that you along with the declarer should decide what card to play from the dummy. You already have all the information you need to maximize your chance of winning the most in trump suit. I give you additional clue. The missing honors are equal. I will end the board here and you can read all about it next week when I will present a movie on the topic as directed by Howard. |
