^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

That is 100% correct. Some people think Azin should bid 2H, as a reverse, and that 2N denies 4 hearts. But that is not correct. A 2H bid is a reverse, and does show 4 hearts. However, it also shows an unbalanced hand with 5+ clubs. Whenever you have a balanced 18-19, you should bid 2N. In other words opening 1C and reversing to 2H promises 5+ clubs and 4 hearts and an unbalanced hand.|

nt||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Wow, I think Azin is a ringer. Excellent play of the cards. Moe should take the Ace of hearts and play a diamond earlier. Then he can only make 4 because Azin cannot afford to play spades. I have noticed that many students duck Aces, sometimes unnecessarily.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are several main reasons to duck an Ace. One is to disrupt communications. On this hand, for example, if Moe ducks the Ace until the 3rd round, then Azin must use an entry to cash the fourth heart. That is the most common reason to duck the Ace. Another reason that comes up occasionally is suppose dummy has a long solid suit missing the Ace with no side entries. In that case the partner of the person holding the Ace should give count, and the defender should hold up on the Ace until he is sure declarer has played the last card of the suit. Again, you are disrupting communications.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The most common other reason is let's say dummy (North) has KQ10 of a suit and let us say East (behind North) has the Ace but not the Jack. Suppose declarer leads that suit and plays the King. East should duck smoothly. Now, in order to get two tricks declarer may get back to his hand and lead the suit again assuming West has the Ace. But if declarer plays the Queen then East wins the Ace and their sides Jack is good. If East had taken the first trick, then declarer would have no choice but to finesse the 10 to get 2 tricks. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, ducking the Ace to hide where it is, is another reason to duck. Having said that, it is rare that ducking is right. So, in general, so long as the Ace captures an honor, it is okay to take it.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ogust is a convention for describing how good the weak 2 is, both in terms of suit and HCP

sb|W|NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Basically, the 2NT bid (Ogust) asks the opener 2 questions:
a) How good is your suit?
b) How good is your hand?|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A good suit is defined as having 2 of the top 3 honors. A good hand is defined as having 8+ HCP. So, the 4 combinations of good/bad suit and hand can be described using the 4 bids between 3C and 3S. All responses to Ogust are artificial. If Moe bids 3C, that shows a bad hand (7 HCP or less) and a bad suit (not 2 of top 3) which is the worst hand he can have. 3S, which Moe just bid, shows the best hand he can have. Good suit (2 of top 3) and good hand (8+). Then, 3D would show a bad hand (7 or less) and a good suit and 3H would show a good hand (8 or more) and a bad suit.|

NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We discussed the auction. Noi made a reasonable bid. It is too bad they had such a bad fit, 3 low clubs opposite 3 low clubs. If Moe only has 2 clubs, then it is likely the hand only has 3 losers, 2 clubs and a spade. Thus, 4S was a good bid. Also, Azin is right. At trick 1, North should overtake the CK with the CA and come back with a club. That way I know North has a doubleton Club, and will give a ruff, and we will take our 3 club tricks.|

^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well since you lose 5C off the top, it does not seem like a good idea. And then unless one of the kibs tells Moe the SQ is doubleton offside :), he will lose a spade too because the finesse is the right play and loses. To answer Noi's question in general, if partner opens a weak 2, 4 of their suit is almost always better than 3N.|

However, there is one exception that I have noted. As Kia the Movie Maker says "All rules have fine print." The fine print on second hand low is, you can play high if it is the setting trick. So, on this hand Azin can see 5 tricks for the defense if she takes the HQ. Their side already has 3, the HQ is 4, and the SQ is 5. That is the one important exception to 2nd hand low. Remember, "It is never wrong to take the setting trick." |

cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played again. Azin is a master declarer tonight. However, let's discuss the auction :). I feel Azin is just a tad weak to bid 2N. There is a problem in standard bidding in that 1C-P-1H-P-1S. The 1S bidder can only jump shift with 18, so could have as much as 17. But you have to live with that, and responder is aware of it. Therefore, I think 1S is slightly better, both because it is truer to the point count, and also the distribution.|

PG| ***** 88 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2N is not that far off, because of the quality spade suit, which gets you up to 17. Having said that, Moe should not just bid 3N because, as I mentioned earlier, 2N does not deny 4 spades. The auction 1C-P-1H-P-2S shows an unbalanced hand, with 5+ clubs and 4 spades. With a balanced 18, even with 4 spades, opener should rebid 2N. Moe should bid 3D, New Minor Forcing, to check for 4 spades.|

NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, lets discuss one issue in the play. In particular my first heart play. As you noticed I played the 9 rather than the Queen. In general, when you have Honor-9 or Honor-10 surrounding dummy, you play the 9 or 10--in this case, I had Queen-9 surrounding the Jack. Therefore, the 9 is the correct play. If you bother to work out all the possible combinations of cards you will see why that play works more often than playing the Queen. In this case, the only time the 9 is wrong is if Azin has the 10 and not the Ace. And even in that case, he still has hearts stopped, so the Queen does not really help much.|

^-{    The Stayman Convention    }
|FP||AT|
The Stayman Convention is used to find a 4-4 major suit fit in NT auctions.|
PG| ***** 99 ***** |


AT|

You should only use Stayman if you have a |FP|2|CP|8|at|medium (8-9)|FP||CP||AT| or |FP|2|CP|8|at|maximum (10 or more)|FP||CP||AT| hand.|
PG| ***** 100 ***** |


AT|

Do not bid Stayman if you have a |CP|8|AT|minimum (0 to 7 points)|CP||AT| hand.|
PG| ***** 101 ***** |

(The Garbage Stayman Convention is described in the Advanced Topics at the end of this tutorial.  

If you decide to play garbage Stayman, then you can bid Stayman when you are 4-4 in the majors with a minimum response.)|
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


AT|

You should bid Stayman if you have a medium or maximum hand and your hand meets any of the following criteria:|
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

{ You have one 4-card major }|
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


AT|

{ You have two 4-card majors }|
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


AT|

{ You have one 4-card major and one 5-card major }|
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


AT|

The Stayman convention is initiated when the responder bids 2C.
This is a completely artificial bid that says nothing about clubs.
It is merely asking the NT opener if he has a 4 (or 5) card major.^-|cp||

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands.  You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.
After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course.  You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made.  You may (not always) use the back arrow in BBO or the undo button in the Viewer to undo the lead.  You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other.  You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. Now, please click |cp|1|AT|^*GR1, RETURN^*N |CP||AT|to return to your original location.|
