^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

On this hand Bonnie should pass. There are virtually no hands that Bonnie can have with a void in spades that warrant a bid. Remember, partner is announcing his hand is only valuable in spades. If you have not spades, his hand could be worthless.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bonnie you did very well right until the end. The only way the hand makes is if I have the HA, so you must assume I do. When I lead a low heart, you must put up the HK. If it loses, you are losing the rest of the tricks, but by ducking you are losing the rest of the tricks for sure. When you are in a difficult contract, you must be an optimist. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's talk about the way to play the hand, based on planning at trick 1. Let's count declarer's winners. There are 4 spade tricks, 1 sure heart trick (maybe 2), 1 diamond and 2 clubs. So, 8 sure tricks as long as there are no ruffs. Thus, there is no reason to delay drawing trumps and in fact every reason to do so. Remember, you should draw trumps ASAP unless there is a good reason not to. The main reason not to is if you need to ruff something in dummy before dummy runs out of trumps. But basically your thought should be to draw trumps unless you have a good reason not to.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here, if Harrington draws trump will make 3 because the heart King is onside, so will get an extra heart trick. Harrington did make 4 because Bonnie was not sure what to discard. But that was a bit lucky.|

^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even given the pass, once Bonnie bids 2H, Spencer's hand really improves. He is 6-4 which is great distribution. He must take a bid over 2H. I would personally bid 2S, but 3C is also fine. Pass is not fine. If Spencer bids 2S, partner should only play him for a 4-card suit, because he would balance with spades with a 5 card suit. As it turns out, because of the bad break, 3C is much better than 2S (as is often the case with 4-4 fits), which is why I said 3C is reasonable as well with such a good suit.|sk||

cp|8|AT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is no reason to double. If you have spades, just bid it. If you double, I would think you had diamonds. My general rule is, double is only takeout if there are 2 unbid suits left, and in this case there are not. Granted, it is unlikely you have a penalty double of 2H, but still, 2S gets the message across.|

{           SUMMARY          }
^-|CS||CP||fp||AT|^B@2^Y@3T|FP||AT|he principal lesson taught by this chapter has been |CP|8|FP|2|AT|to lead trumps as quickly as possible unless some excellent reason exists for doing otherwise.|CP||FP||AT| All sorts of dire fates have been predicted for the Bridge player who puts off leading trumps--for no good reason until the adverse trumps come romping boisterously in to break up his peace of mind at just the wrong moments. |
PG| ***** 98 ***** |


CP|8|FP|2|AT|
^-The rule to lead trumps--or to think about leading trumps 
until it is crystal clear that the lead should be postponed 
is far and away the most important of all in suit play. 
^-|
PG| ***** 99 ***** |


CP||FP||AT|
It is the good Bridge player's automatic impulse for self-preservation. He thinks first, in playing a suit contract, of the moment when he should lead trumps; always in the back of his mind, until every adverse trump has been played, is the prodding insistence of the thought:|
PG| ***** 100 ***** |


cp|8|CS||FP|2|AT|
^-
{          "Now shall I lead trumps? If not, why not?"          }
^-|
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


fp||CP||AT|
In fact, at a suit contract, the first suit the Declarer should try to establish is almost always the trump suit. As a corollary to the drawing of the Opponents' trumps in the process of establishing your own trumps, whenever but one trump is left outstanding, almost always capture it if it is lower than your highest trump (even if it costs two of your trumps), but let it alone if it is higher than any of your remaining trumps.|
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


AT|

There are times when you should not lead trumps at the very first chance, though it is still true that you should lead them as soon as the time is ripe. Just bear in the front of your mind the constant checking thought: put off leading trumps, even for 1 trick, only when you have a good and sufficient reason for doing so--that is, only when you gain some advantage to compensate for the risk you run by letting the Opponents hold onto their trumps for any longer than you can help.

{          Howard's Comments          }
^-|CS||CP||fp||AT|^B@2^Y@3I|FP||AT| have two notes on the material in this chapter. |
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


FP||cp|8|at|
^B@2^Y@3A. |FP||cp||at|I support Watson's statement that drawing trumps as soon as possible is important, because you do not want to let the defenders trump your winners with their low trumps. So, your first order of business when planning out the play of a hand is to decide if you can draw trumps immediately. You should do so, unless there is a good reason not to. However, on more hands than not, drawing trumps (or at least drawing all of the opponents trump), must be delayed. Here are the most common reasons:|
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


AT|

1) The most common reason to not draw trumps is that you need to use some of dummy's trumps to ruff out losers. If you draw all the opponents' trumps, dummy might not have any trump cards left to ruff out those losers. In that case, you need to exhaust the short suit in dummy first, before drawing trumps.|
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


AT|

2) The opponents can make you exhaust all your trumps before you establish your side suit winners. This is known as "losing control." If the opponents are able to exhaust you of all of your trumps, should they get back in the lead you will be effectively playing a no trump contract at that point. The opponents can cash the little cards in their long side suits, because you are no longer able to trump them. Although this can occur on any hand, the most common time this occurs is when you have 4 trumps in each hand. |

^-|CS||CP||fp||AT|^B@2^Y@3I|FP||AT|t takes at least 3 rounds to draw all of the opponents' trump (since the best you can hope for is a 3-2 split). If you have already ruffed a loser in one of the hands, you will only have one remaining trump after drawing trumps (since the hand in which you ruffed now only has 3 trumps remaining). Therefore, if you have to lose the lead after drawing trumps, the opponents might be able to make you ruff with your only remaining trump. If you then lose the lead again, you will have no more trump left to protect against small cards that have been established in the opponents long suits. To remedy this situation, you might have to knock out the opponents' high cards in a suit before drawing trumps.|

By the way, this illustrates an important point about choice of contracts. In general, it is better to play in a 4-4 fit than a 5-3 fit. This is because you can use the 5 card suit to pitch losers from the other hand, and trump those losers. However, if you are in danger of losing control, then the presence of a 5th trump in one hand gives you an extra measure of protection. This should be given serious consideration when choosing your contract, particularly if you have a singleton or void in a side suit; in that case, having a long trump suit can be crucial in preventing you from losing control.|

3) You need the trump suit for entries to play other suits appropriately.|

Many players have trouble remembering if all trumps have been drawn. Here are two tips that can be used to help you:|

1) Rather than counting out how many trumps have been played, just remember how many trumps remain in the opponents' hands. Thus, if you have an 8 card fit, the opponents start out with 5 trumps between their 2 hands. If you draw one round, and both opponents follow, you now only need to remember there are only 3 trumps remaining in the two hands. If you then draw another round, and both opponents follow again, you now only need to remember there is just one outstanding trump remaining.|

2) Don't forget to deduct one trump from the remaining count if the opponents ruff one of your tricks. This is a very common error that I see over and over again, even by very good players. For example, if you have an eight card fit, and the opponents have ruffed a trick, there are now only 4 trumps remaining. Had they not ruffed, it would take at least 3 rounds to draw all the trumps. However, once they ruff, you often can draw the remaining trump in two rounds.|
