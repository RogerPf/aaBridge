^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are very few hands where 5 of a minor plays better than 3N. And I don't tend to worry too much about voids playing 3N. In this case, since my void is in spades, it is unlikely partner has more than 4 spades, so you are very likely to get a spade lead, so that is a bit of a worry. So, here it is more possible than usual that 5D is a better contract than 3N. However, my years of experience tell me 3N is usually best. So, with 10 HCP and a very nice diamond suit, I bid 3N and hope that it makes. We often will be able to take 9 tricks off the top, and even if we can't , it is possible we have spades double stopped.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Your other choice is to jump to 5D. I would not fault someone for doing that, but it also would not surprise me if that contract went down. It is also possible that you can make six diamonds if partner has the right cards, but without a sophisticated bidding system that allows you to explore for a minor suit slam over a 1N opener, it would be difficult to bid.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well we have lots to discuss on this hand. This is actually one of those rare hands where 5 of a minor is a better contract than 3N. Having said that, 3N should make (but on a different line of play). With the line of play Marge took, 3N could actually end up going down. First of all Marge, before we get into your line, why did you take your hearts first?|

MarDef: Yes.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well the three easy tricks are available later as well. By playing it early you ended up setting up extra hearts for the defense--but West failed to capitalize on. More on that later.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The line you took depends on your guessing clubs. There is no point in delaying. You are going to have to guess sooner or later anyway. Now having said that, let's discuss the best line of play. Basically Marge, you pinned your hopes on the club suit. Let's say you guess the clubs right. That gives you four clubs, three hearts, and one spade. It is still not enough tricks, you need a diamond trick. You still have to set up a diamond trick. Here is your best hope. You made the very good play of ducking spades for 3 tricks. That was excellent. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You now simply have to hope that whoever has the @DA does not have the last spade. Otherwise you should be down no matter what. Therefore, there is no need to guess the clubs. Simply throw away two small hearts and two small clubs or two clubs, a heart and a diamond in dummy and keep all of dummy's diamonds. Knock out the @DA. If they don't cash the last spade, you have 9 easy tricks without worrying about who has the @CQ. Basically, your plan should be to take enough diamonds to make the contract--at least four.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT|^B@2
MarDef: I was very worried about the @DA being in the wrong place.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As I said, if it is in the wrong place you are going down anyway. So, it has to be in the right place. You don't have 9 tricks otherwise. Now as to the defense given Marge's line. At trick eight Ginny should have played diamond nine instead of six (start of a high/low) to give Mei ann count--not that important here. Mei ann, should win the first or second round of diamonds then play hearts to set the contract. Mei ann had two sure heart tricks.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I notice that students like to duck Aces. There are certainly times when you should duck Aces. But you have to have a good reason such as cutting off an entry to declarer or dummy. However, most of the time you should not duck your Aces as long as they capture a high honor. If in doubt take your Ace as long as it captures a high honor from declarer.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, most of my comments are about bidding. I would not open Mei ann's hand, as it does not meet the rule of 20. Ginny's 1H overcall is fine. However, Marge should not bid 1S. Responding to an overcall is different than responding to an opener. Since you double and correct with a real strong hand, overcaller's hand is usually limited to 15 or 16. Therefore, responder to overcaller is not obligated to bid with six points. Now, if responder has support, she should definitely raise, even with six points. But bidding a new suit should show a 5+ card suit.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I also play, were Marge an unpassed hand that a new suit is forcing, even as a response to an overcaller. However, some partnerships do not play that. They play 1S can be passed even were Marge an unpassed hand. Marge should bid, but 1N is probably better. In this case 1N does not show 6-10. It tends to show 8- a bad 11 because you can pass with a balanced 6 or 7 count. So, I would have bid 1N with your hand Marge. Remember, Ginny can have as few as 8 or 9 points. Unlike an opener, she does not have to have a good hand. Therefore, responder to an overcaller has to be more careful, particularly with no known fit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's talk about the bidding. Although a case can be made for opening 2C with Marge's hand, there is a good reason not to. Were Marge's long suit a major there is a much better case. However, particularly when your suit is diamonds, you should avoid opening 2C unless you have a really really strong hand. The reason for that is, the auction is likely to go 2C-2D-3D, and you are already at the 3 level with little information exchanged.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What happened on this hand is Marge made a reasonable bid, but spades is a much better contract than NT. My rule in general about 2C is to open with a balanced 22+ because I can rebid 2N, or 3N with 25+.  Otherwise, with a long minor, I see if I can count 9 tricks in my hand. Marge's hand is close: 6 diamonds a club and a spade for sure. But particularly because her suit is diamonds, I would open 1@D.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, there are some days when 2C would work out very well with her hand. Just keep in mind the long diamond problem when you open 2C.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ginny is making at least a mild slam try, and is showing exactly 3 spades. Why is that? Well, first of all, with 4+ spades, Ginny should bid Jacoby 2N right away. So, by not bidding 2N, Ginny is denying 4 spades. 2C by Ginny establishes a game force. And one of the important principles of 2/1 is something known as "fast arrival." Fast Arrival works as follows. Once you establish a game force, the faster you bid game, the less interested you are in slam. Therefore, if Ginny had a min opener with 3 spades, she would bid 4S over 2D--she is "arriving fast" at game.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case, Ginny has a good hand, and is interested in slam. Thus, she bids 2S which gives us lots more room to explore for slam. There are different follow ups to 2S, but first of all, if I am not interested, I can bid 4S. However, with this hand from now on we are making control bids, showing first and second round control. |

@D@D nome: Now, if you wish, you can play this hand double dummy. The opening lead was the heart Ace, however, you can choose a different lead. Just click any card from that hand. When finished or if not interested in the double dummy feature please, click the forward arrow to move to the next  section. |

^B@2^*B^Y@3Movie maker: ^*N|cp||at|Late at night even for us in Southern California kibbing Howard and the group playing is a treat. I usually try to shadow bid and play before Howard does and see whether I even can bat close to 500. Also, I try to do fact check and see that he does what he teaches. So far he has been batting 1000. The current board is an example. I have removed the names of the opponents but kept the name for North as I am sure he does not mind my intrusion. Let us only kib Howard's hand.|

However, I also heard him many times saying, "Of course there are exceptions." So, I asked, "was not playing second low an exception?" Unlike now I could see all four hands.|

at|^c@2^Y@3This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I like to have a record representing the sessions as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it. The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. 

Please, notes unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some boards are presented in a closed format. To open any hand click that seat. Another click opens all hands. ^*BThe links in this file are clickable^*N. Simply click it if you wish to visit the site. 

To play a board double dummy|FP||AT| ( play free) click the first card you like and continue until the trick is over. In most instances you will see the opening lead. You can undo the opening lead and choose your own. After completing the trick please left click anywhere |cp|8|at|except the forward arrow box |cp||at|. You can undo the play of any card or the entire trick by clicking on the backward arrow box once for each card. Further, you can review the last trick by placing the cursor over the trick. What you cannot do is click  the forward arrow as it cancels the double dummy feature.

at|^-{Odd/Even Discard}
^-|qx|O1,return|CS||CP||fp|2|at|^C@2^Y@3The first time you discard (you don't follow suit), Odd/Even works as follows. If you discard an odd card in a suit, that is encouraging attitude. If you discard an even card, that is discouraging attitude. It only applies to your first discard. After that, standard signaling is in effect. A few, but not many, people play that an even card is suit preference (e.g. a low even is suit preference for the lower of the remaining suits, a high even is suit preference for the higher of the remaining suits--like Lavinthal discards), but I recommend against that. In general, I am not a fan of suit preference, other than the one special case where you lead back a suit that you know partner is trumping.	|

^C@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|But Howard there are those who say "Lavinthal feature" is played by the most. What say you?|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^c@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, I recommend against it being suit preference. More often than not, you have no suit preference, and are simply discarding an even card from a long suit in which you are sure the discard will not adversely affect the defense.

On rare occasions, you may discard a high even card to show suit preference for the higher of the remaining suits. But, that opportunity rarely presents itself. I would stick with "odd encourages, even discourages" and that's it.|
