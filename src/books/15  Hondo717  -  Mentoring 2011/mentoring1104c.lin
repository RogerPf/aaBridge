^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The auction was good. With a nice 6 card heart suit and a singleton spade, 4H is clear. Now, having said that, you should strain to bid 4S over 4H, using the law of total tricks as your guide.With a singleton spade and 3 hearts, I cannot bid 4S, but it does bother me. Basically, 4S as a sacrifice over 4H is often a good result, so you should do so if there is any excues. However, I cannot justify it on this hand.|

NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|At trick two, Eddy was returning a spade for me to ruff, since he knows both declarer and I are out. The problem is, he needs to give me a suit preference in spades, so I know what to return. By leading a low spade, he is telling me to return a club, the lower of the remaining non-trump suits. Had he returned a high spade, say the 9, that would have said he wants a diamond back, the higher of the remaining non-trump suits. Since he has no preference, he should return a middle spade, say the 6. That says, "partner you choose."  |
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once I ruff and return a club, declarer should be reasonably confident of making at least 4. The clubs are all good, and there are no diamond losers. So, declarer should draw 2 rounds of hearts, if the Queen does not come down then he loses the heart, otherwise he will make 5. On this hand, he should make 5. No big deal in IMPs, but important in Match Points.|

NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This auction is a good illustration of the law of total tricks in action.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |

bizarro: Wow, I should have passed.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No Ed, your bid was okay. Your partner's was not. Basically, once partner preempts, use the law of total tricks to determine how high to go, assuming you are not strong enough to bid game. So, with only an 8 card fit, a 3 level bid is not safe.  West should pass. The 3S bid did give Eddy a problem, but this is one of those hands where "the operation was a success, but the patient died ", :).|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|By that I mean, the 3S bid gave Eddy a problem, and he chose an action that would have worked out badly. Normally, East should pass. In general, once the preempter opens, he is out of the auction unless partner asks him a question. A simple raise is not a question--only 2N or a new suit are questions. However, there are occasional exceptions. |
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With a void in hearts, Ed, assuming there is a 9 card trump fit especially at favorable vulnerability, has a nice 4S bid over 4H. Remember, as I said last hand, you should strain to bid 4S over 4H, and, although it is rare, this is one of those hands where Ed is allowed to bid again.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let's discuss Eddy's options. Unfortunately, he is really put to the guess. There are 4 possible choices, and none of them stand out.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT|^B@2
EddyHaskel: My options were, double, 3N, 4H, or pass. 4H was the short straw :).|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, Eddy named them all. Let me go through merits of each. I like pass the least, although there are hands where it could be right.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4H could be right, but it is a shot in the dark. There are 8 remaining hearts out. Let us assume the pre-empter has on average 2 hearts. That leaves six between West and South. That means that on average we have an 8 card fit. I certainly could have 4, and rarely 5. But even then, we only have a 9-card fit so a 10 trick contract is dangerous. On the other hand, 4H could work very well.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3N is another possibility. I don't like 3N particularly. The problem with that is, with Kx of spades, and assuming West has 3 spades, unless I have the SA. If we cannot take 9 tricks off the top, we are probably going down. So, by default I would double with Eddy's hand. After all said and done, any of those could be right. I rank the choices by Eddy as double being my first choice, 4H my second, 3N third, and pass my fourth choice. If Eddy doubles I am not sure what I would do. Anyway very interesting hand.|

bizarro: Right, I almost always miss the reverses.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, you should actually be more worried about missing game, than bidding 3C. Your other alternatives are 2H or 2S. A reverse forces us to 2N, so I cant pass 2H. 2S is artificial--4th suit forcing--establishing a game force. I don't think Ed is quite strong enough to bid 2S, but it is close over a reverse.|

mb|p|sk|S|lb|*bWhat would be your bid?^^3s|mb|3S|NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, here is an important rule when looking for 3N, which is clearly what I want to do on this auction. If there are 2 unbid suits, a bid in one of those suits shows a stopper. However, if there is only one unbid suit as in this case (spades being the unbid suit) a spade bid by me asks about a stopper. The reason being, if I had a stopper I bid 3N myself. Thus, my 3S bid here asks partner to bid 3N with a spade stopper.|

NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, on this hand I telegraphed that a spade lead was called for. West has a clear lead of the spade King and should be very disappointed if partner does not have the spade Ace.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We should lose 2 spades off the top Ed, so don't worry about missing slam. This is one of the few times I lead an unprotected Ace. The opponents showed no spade stopper. On the other hand, if I lead the Ace and the opponents have the King, then they probably missed 3N anyway.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, if I had Eddy's hand and was on lead, on this auction it is one of the few times I lead an unprotected Ace. However, as I always say, if you NEVER lead an unprotected Ace, you will come out way ahead in the long run.|

For example, had Ginny bid 3C rather than 2S, then there are 2 remaining unbid suits in terms of stoppers, spades and hearts. In that case (not this hand), my 3H bid would show a heart stopper and deny a spade stopper. However, on this hand, we have bid 3 suits therefore, if I had a stopper in hearts, I can bid 3N. By bidding 3H, I am denying a heart stopper and asking Ginny to bid 3N with hearts stopped. So, my 3H cue bid would have a different meaning depending on whether or not Ginny had bid spades.|

mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, I have to decide whether or not to bid 5D. I will assume 3 diamonds in Ginny's hand, not 100% guaranteed,  but a good guess. Next, let's count my Bergen Declarer Points. 12 HCP, 2 length points, and 1 quality suit point, for a total of 15 Starting Points. My addons are 2 for the singleton, 1 for the 4 card side club suit, and 1 for the sixth diamond. That gets me up to 19, therefore, we have more than 29, enough for game. In fact we are in the slam range. But I will be content to bid game.|

pc|HA|pc|D3|pc|HT|NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, I am guessing from Marge's carding that she started with 3 hearts. That means Mei ann started with six. Why is that important? Because, I have to figure out how to play diamonds. Many of you were taught, with a 9 card fit missing the Queen, you play for the drop. If you have no idea about the defenders distributions, that is a reasonable thing to do although it turns out actually, that the difference between finessing and playing for the drop is only a couple of percent. Therefore, if you decide you always want to finesse, that would be okay.|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


pc|H6|NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is my rule with a 9 card fit, missing the Queen. If neither defender has shown a 5+ card suit, I usually play for the drop. But if one defender has shown a 5+ card suit, I finesse the other defender for the Queen if possible. I also do play the Ace or King first, in case there is a singleton Queen. On this hand, that turns out to be a fatal mistake. But, at a real table, where I cannot see all 4 hands, I would play the diamond Ace first, intending to finesse West for the  diamond Queen if it does not drop.|

^-{        Writing on the Sand - by nome         }
^-|FP||CP||at|^B@2Bridge information stays with me as long as writing on the sand at the beach. It takes only one soft wave to wash everything away. However, as I get older I become more persistent and keep writing on the sand--reviewing the material over and over. This week I have one of my bidding misunderstandings which Howard kindly corrected. In the following board you can get all the details.  |

sk||at| which as you see was not the case. He has been in the dark all along and never knew what a free bid after a double means. He even compounded his error by mentioning that Marge should have bid a negative double. He must not have his glasses on and saw the double by West as an overcall. Marge had none of that and the case went to Howard's court for review which is coming next. The rest of the bidding and the play is irrelevant.|

^B@2 ^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The modern approach is to allow "free bids" with fewer values than previously. Basically, the approach over a takeout double is, if responder has something useful to say, he/she should say it. This means, for example, if responder has 8 or more points, or a suit worth mentioning even with only 6 points, he/she should make a bid. A suit worth mentioning is either a 5 card suit or a good 4 card suit. In this case, hearts, with 2 honors, qualifies. Note that Marge did not redouble, so Kia should realize she has less than 10 points.|

^B@2 ^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Obviously, Marge could not make a negative double, since West doubled. But had the auction gone 1C-1D, even then, Marge should bid 1H rather than making a negative double. The negative double in that case should show both majors.|
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2 ^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The problem case for negative doubles is when it goes 1D-2C. There a negative double should show both majors, but needs to be a little flexible. With long spades and a weak hand, responder can make a negative double and then correct 2H to 2S, to show a weak hand with spades. (The same is not true with long hearts, because correcting 2S to 3H requires going to the 3 level.) Also, if responder has one major and club support, she can also make a negative double, correcting the wrong major to 3C. Finally, with 4-3, if responder has a good 3-card major and is willing to play in a 4-3 fit, she can make a negative double.|

^B@2 ^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to what Kia should do over 3D. More often than not, Marge will have a 5 card suit. So Kia should assume that is the case and bid 3H, presuming a 9 card fit. In this case, that turns out to not be the case, but 3H happens to make anyway.|

cp|8|fp||at|^C@2^z@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are condensed from the chat logs. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board.
