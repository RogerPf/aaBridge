^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, let us review a couple of things we learned here. First, if you have a 2N rebid, make it, regardless of your major suit holdings. Of course, had I bid 1S, then Kerrie should bid 4S, not 2N. On the other hand, if you cannot raise partner's major, then bid 2N if you have 18-19 balanced, as it is very descriptive.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The next question is, what is New Minor Forcing in this sequence, since we bid both minors?|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You have to agree, but playing that 3C is still new minor forcing makes sense. I personally prefer Checkback Stayman to New Minor Forcing. That way 2C over a 1N rebid, and 3C over a 2N rebid is always asking about opener's majors. There is no ambiguity, and opener has the option of bidding 2D/3D over 2C/3C, which gives you more room.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|^B@2
EddyHaskel: It looks like a sign off in clubs if you don't have an agreement.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Interesting point Eddy. However, all bids over 2N are forcing. You can never sign off in 3. If anything, if not new minor forcing, then 3C would be a club slam try. In fact, you should rarely pass a 2N rebid. That is a very low percentage bid. Unless you make exactly 2N, you will not do well passing 2N.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |

duffer66: Even if bidding goes 1@S - P - 2@H - P - 2NT?|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a different auction. I meant the jump to 2N showing 18 or 19. Playing SAYC, 1S-2H-2N can be passed.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First, the auction. Let's discuss Nada's negative double. Given her heart length and spade shortness it was a good bid. It has been suggested that I should cue bid 2D (limit raise) rather than bid 2S. However, I have 2 problems with that.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT|^B@2
1) Most importantly, I don't have enough points. Playing Bergen, you could say I have 10 dummy points (8 HCP, 1 for doubleton, 1 for 5 card suit). But my diamond length is probably not that useful given West opened 1D
2) I like to make the cue bid with 4-card support. Sometimes I am stuck and have to cue with 3-card support. But I think discovering the 9th trump is very important, so my agreement is that cue bids promise 4-card support 90% of the time.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is similar to the auction 1C-P-1S-P-2S, where 2S promises 4 but will be done on 3 on occasion. Now, when it goes P-P, Nada has a problem. One thing to note is, when the opponents have found a fit, and the points are evenly distributed, and they stop at the 2 level you should rarely pass. Letting them play at the 2 level when a suit has been bid and raised will more often than not be a bad result for your side.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, although Nada only has 4 HCP, because of her heart length and spade shortness, she should bid 3H. In general, the person short in the opponents trump suit should be the one to bid. Nada had the opportunity to bid 2H and did not. So, if she then bids 3H after making a negative double, she is showing a hand with long hearts but not good enough to bid 2H. To repeat, if partner makes a "negative double and correct", so to speak, that shows a weak hand and a long suit because with a stronger hand partner would have bid the suit directly.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next, let's get to whether hope should bid 3H. That is a weak jump shift, and is certainly plausible. However, believe it or not her hand might be too strong to make a weak jump shift. If West has 4 hearts and a reasonable hand, you might want to play in game. But 3H is pretty much a shutout bid. West should not raise to 4 unless he has a really good hand, even with 4-card support.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very nicely played. One comment on the defense before we get to the bidding. When you were in with the @SJ Nada, why didn't you lead a heart to start trick nine? If you had, Eddy might have finessed the spade and you might have scored your @SK. Never be afraid to give the declarer a ruff to which he is entitled anyway. At worst that is a passive play. It does not give anything away and, in this case, it might help you score your @SK. If you cannot prevent the ruff anyway, it usually gives nothing away to give declarer a ruff.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's talk about the bidding. Had Nada not bid 2H, I am not sure what I would  have bid. As I said, you can raise on 3-card support if needed but, I probably rebid 2C. However, once Nada bids 2H, my spades look better, as I am short in hearts.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |

hope: Was 2@H wrong?|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2H was fine. I was just saying that I might  have changed my bid if you had not bid 2H.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people play a convention known as a "support double", which works very well here. Support doubles work as follows. If the auction goes 1 minor - p - 1 major - overcall, a double by opener is not penalty. It shows exactly 3-card support for responder's major. So, on this hand, playing support doubles, it would go 1C-P-1S-2H-dbl and Eddy would know I have exactly 3-card support. With 4-card support I bid 2S. |
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|People also extend that convention to support redoubles, the relevant auction being 1C-P-1S-dbl-redbl which also showing 3-card support. With interference, assuming no support doubles, very often partner will be forced to compete with 3-card support.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, I am going to teach everyone a new version of Garbage Stayman. My hand is not good enough to invite. On this hand pass is probably OK, but with a weaker hand and 4-4 in the majors, I would like to play in our best major suit fit. |
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The way major suit Garbage Stayman works is as follows:
I bid 2C Stayman. If Eddy responds 2D, I bid 2H. That tells Eddy I have a bad hand with hearts and spades. He should pass with better hearts or correct to 2S with better spades. Of course as Eddy will find out, we would have been better off in 1N, lol.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Only down 1 despite the horrible breaks, and everything off side which illustrates why it is often better to play in a suit than NT when you have fewer points. That convention is also known as "Crawling Stayman." You need not to alert the 2C but you do need to alert the 2H over 2D.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I mostly want to discuss the play, but will briefly discuss the bidding. Why did I not bid 2C since I have 4 hearts. With 4-3-3-3 distribution, often you make the same number of tricks in NT as in hearts or spades. And since 3N requires 9 tricks to 4H 10 tricks, I felt that 2N was warranted, particularly since I had such weak hearts.|
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now as to the play. There are several interesting and informative declarer technique issues here. First of all, at trick 1, Marge should play a low spade, not the 10. Why is that? Because suppose zewzew had a spade honor then if she got in and lead a spade through Marge, Marge might only get 1 spade tricks. But if Marge plays low, she is guaranteed 2 spade tricks. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You are forcing a spade honor out by playing low as well. If zewzew plays low, then you win the Jack. If she plays high, you have forced out an honor, and still have the Jack and 10 left to force out whichever honor is still missing. The way you played it, unless Nada has both the K and Q, you are only guaranteed 1 spade trick.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another declarer play technique issue. When you are running a long suit, in this case diamonds you typically play out the honors from the shorter hand first, in this case South. The reason for that is, that way you make sure you do not block the suit. The way Marge played it, where she cashed the @DA in her hand first, she blocked the suit, she could not get to her @DJ without wasting an entry.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's talk about the opening lead First. North has no good opening lead. The only suit I would rule out is a club. Leading an unprotected non-trump Ace is rarely right, and often wrong. Leading away for a King is dangerous, but can work out. Basically, North has to guess, and either decide to lead away from a King, or lead @sA and a spade. On some hands the heart lead will work well. On this hand it did not, but she has no way of knowing that. The best lead happens to be Ace and another spade, but that is hard to know, a heart is also a good choice in general.|
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let me talk about the bidding. If you play Bergen, most people play it is off after an overcall and I think most people play it is off even after a double. 2N over a double is "Jordan 2N", showing a limit raise or better in spades. So, there is no reason to play 3D as Bergen over the double. The only question is, should 3C be the 6-9 Bergen Raise (or 3D if playing Reverse Bergen). I can see a good argument for making that agreement, but you have to make sure partner is on the same page.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very nicely done zewzew. We already discussed the bidding. zewzew might consider bidding 2N, but that is a bit aggressive. The club suit is likely to take six tricks and on a spade lead, she will take a spade trick. So, if I can come up with 2 tricks, we will make 3N. And since I bid 2H, that is certainly quite possible. The question is, do I have a diamond stopper. It turns out no, so on a diamond lead we are down 1 in 3N. But, on a non-diamond lead, because the heart finesse works, we make 3N. So, some experts would bid 2N or even 3N, but I think 3C is fine.|

Since 2H was forcing, zewzew may have chosen 3C as the least of evils bid. I really felt passing 3C was pretty clear, but was happy to give pard 4 card support. And, if east has the AQ of spades, 5C does not make. Or if clubs don't break 2-2 it is harder as well. So I think our result would be fine in duplicate.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, let's first talk a little about the bidding. Third seat is the best seat to preempt. Since there are 2 passes, you can bet almost for sure that if you have a preempt hand, fourth seat has an opener. So, you want to make it as difficult as possible for the fourth seat, which is exactly what happened in this hand. BTW, second seat is the worst seat to preempt, so if you want to be conservative, that is the best seat with which to do so. The reason for that is, first seat passed, so it is more likely your partner has some values, and you might be preempting your pard instead of the opponents. |
PG| ***** 192 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, that reasoning never stops me from preempting even in second seat. Now, over 3S, what should Ginny do? It is not clear. Double is one possibility. The problem of course being diamonds. 4H is another possibility but very chancy with such a bad heart suit. Now, let me ask you this Ginny, suppose your hand was the following @SAx @HQxxx @DAQx @CA10xx. What would you bid over 3S? All I have done is change a small heart to a small diamond.|

gimit: Double.|
PG| ***** 194 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Double is one possibility. 3NT is the other. The point is, I made the hand slightly worse (although better for a takeout double) and yet you are willing to bid with that hand, and not with the stronger hand. 3NT is probably a slightly better call with the hand I gave you. So, my choice would have been 3N with Ginny's hand as it was. It is a bit risky, but she should assume that all cards outside spades reside in the non-preempter's hand. So, as long as the partner of the preempter has no more than 2 Spades, 3N should have plays.|

PG| ***** 196 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With 16 points, you cannot really afford to pass, because then the opponents might be stealing you blind. In fact, csalmon is correct, 3N makes because South has no entries. Now, that might not prevent Marge from bidding 4S, but then at least you would double. As it was we were minus 100 on a hand where you can make 3N.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, because Ginny passed. However, had Ginny bid 3N, you probably take some action over 4S.|
PG| ***** 199 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, as to whether Marge should bid 4S. It does not exactly follow the law (9 card fit, so not safe at the 4 level). But, it is quite possible they can make a game, although with 5 hearts it would have to be 5 of a minor.|
PG| ***** 200 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had your 5-card suit been a minor I think 4S has some tactical advantage. But because you have hearts, I probably would have passed. |
PG| ***** 202 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, it worked out fine, as aggressive bids often do. The main lesson on the hand is Ginny should find some action to take, however imperfect. Ginny could also double 4S, with 3 pretty sure tricks and some possibilities for a fourth trick (one of the red Queens). Pard has to have something, since I have a weak hand, and Marge has less than an opener as well. Again, you cannot let the opponents steal from you with a preempt. It is true, sometimes you double and they make, but if you never double, you will usually get a bad result, or average at best.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out it goes down on a heart lead. But, there is no way for Stan to know that. And it only goes down on a heart lead if the @HK is offside. I would have chosen a diamond myself. So, slam should be bid for sure.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, let me quickly sum up the quantitative 4NT bid. If the bidding goes say 1N-P-4N, or 2N-P-4N, or 2C-p-2D-p-2N-p-4N the jump to 4N is known as quantitative. It asks the original NT bidder to bid six with a maximum. If you opened 1N you have 15-17 and maximum is considered 17 or a good 16 (e.g 16 with a 5 card suit, or several 10s and 9s). If the auction goes say 2N-P-4N, the 2N bid is 20-21, so opener should bid 6 with 21 or 20 with a nice 5 card suit and so forth.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Notice I led back the @C8, which is a high club so Anna correctly led back a heart, because my high club was a suit preference signal. It asked Anna to lead back the higher of the 2 remaining non-trump suits in this case hearts. Had I led a low club, I was asking her to lead a diamond, the lower of the 2 suits.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, now let's discuss Roberta's play of the hand. Let's look at her losers. She has 1 or 2 heart losers, possibly a spade loser, and 1 or 2 club losers. That is 4-6 losers. Given Anna preempted, it is much more likely she is short in spades and Roberta only probably has 1 entry to dummy. Unless Anna has the @HK, which is not likely. So, the spade finesse is absolutely correct. If it makes you feel any better Roberta, even if Anna gets out with a diamond instead of a club, you lose 2 clubs and 2 hearts and go down anyway. So, no matter what you do you are down.|
PG| ***** 237 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One other point which is Roberta's 3S bid. Given Stan was a passed hand, it has some merit However, if Stan was not a passed hand, Roberta should strongly consider reopening with a double. If Stan had a penalty double, he can't make it, since a double there by Stan is negative. So, Roberta has to protect against a potential penalty double by Stan. Any time the bidding goes 1X-3Y-p-p, and you are short in suit Y (the preempter's suit) you should reopen with a double to protect if partner has a penalty double. Otherwise you will never be able to penalize the opponents. |
PG| ***** 238 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If Stan had not been a passed hand, then I think double by Roberta is better than bidding 3S. Although because she has such a good spade suit, 3S is still ok. But remember, you should strain to double in pass out seat if you are short in the overcaller's suit. |
PG| ***** 239 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you are deciding whether or not to double for penalty (or convert pard's takeout double for penalty) the 2 most important factors are shortness in pard's suit (singleton or void), and length in trumps. If you have both of those, pass is almost always right. Shortness in pard's suit, plus trump control in their suit is golden on defense.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, first let me discuss the auction. Should Anna bid 3H? It is not clear, but I think she should. By the law of total tricks they likely only have an 8 card fit. However, my competitive guidelines include the following If the opponents are at the 2-level with a known fit you should not be happy to let them play it there. So, even with an 8-card fit, you should push to the 3-level. |
PG| ***** 259 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, if the opponents are at the 3-level you should only bid "3 over 3" if you have a 9-card fit, or you have a singleton or void in their suit. I think, particularly given Stan has no points in spades, a negative double is ok. If you had opened 1H, even assuming no Bergen raises he bids 2H.|
PG| ***** 260 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, although normally second hand low is correct when Roberta leads a diamond off the board, Anna should know the diamond position. Partner led high low. Since partner did not support the suit, he would lead low from 3 small. Therefore, Roberta has the 9 left and Stan is out and then Anna has to cash hearts right away before Roberta throws them on the @D10. So, take the @DJ, and then play Ace and the Jack of hearts.|
