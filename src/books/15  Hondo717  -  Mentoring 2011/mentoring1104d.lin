^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would definitely open 2S (or even 3S) with Eddy 's hand. Sure, we might have a heart fit, but spades will play well even opposite a singleton and certainly opposite a doubelton whereas hearts only plays well when I have at least 3 hearts to 2 honors or 4 hearts. So, Eddy  should just get the preempt in and not worry about missing hearts. It is very unlikely hearts will take more tricks than spades. |

^B@2 ^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let's take the auction as is. 1C is fine as is 1D, and so is Michaels. Now, depending on what you play Vered has a choice of bids. I play that 2H and 2S over 2D Michaels shows stoppers, so I would bid 2H with Vered's hand, hoping to play 3N if West has a spade stopper.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2 ^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|  I don't mind the diamond raise as well, but another choice is 3S, which must be a splinter. 4S is clear by me, since we have a 10 card fit (I know Eddy  has 5 spades, don't know he has six) and 4S is probably only down 1--losing 2 hearts, 1 diamond and 1 club. It shows the power of owning a lot of trumps with a distributional hand. 5C is a nice bid by Harrington.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2 ^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play. One thing about Eddy's defense. It is clear that diamonds are the key side suit. So, he  needs to keep his diamond to give Vered the least information possible. You can safely pitch spades since I must have 5 (or at least 4 if Vered has S KQ). Had I been playing the hand, once Eddy pitches a diamond, I would take the double finesse in diamonds. If Eddy is being tricky, pitching a diamond from Jx, then I congratulate him on an excellent play. Without the diamond pitch it is not clear how to play the hand.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2 ^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since Eddy has only shown up with 1 club, and he could be 5/5, there is a good chance he has 2 diamonds. So, with no diamond pitch I probably just play for the 2-2 break or a singleton honor in Eddy's hand, if he drops the DQ or DJ on the first diamond trick. That illustrates why keeping the diamond is so important.|

^B@2 ^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, I have found out that West has the QJ of diamonds and the King of clubs. That is 6 HCP. It is possible that West is aggressive and bid 2D with something like void Qxx QJxxxx Kxxx. But that is very unlikely. It is much more likely that West has the HA. In fact, there is a non-trivial possibility that West has both the Ace and Queen of hearts. |

^B@2 ^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another interesting hand. Lets go over a few more points. Eddy 's 3D bid might only be a limit raise. So, with my weak opener, I cannot bid 4S. My 3S bid says I am not interested in game if Eddy  has a limit raise.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |

harrington: Howard, with Eddy's hand would you just bid 4S?|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2 ^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Harrington brings up an interesting question. Eddy's hand is not as strong as it looks, believe it or not. The Queen-Jack of spades are in some sense wasted since we have a known 11 card fit, so even with just AKxxxx we have no trump losers.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2 ^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And the DK, although likely to have some value due to the overcall, probably does not fit well with my hand. So, assuming 1 Diamond loser, the question is, do I have a hand with no heart or club losers. While it is certainly possible, it is by no means certain or even likely. And even if I do have the DA, do I then have a hand with only 1 loser in clubs and hearts. Again not clear. So, rather than bidding 5S, Eddy  should bid 4D, as I suggested, and let me participate in the decision. If I have a hand with no losers in hearts and clubs, I would certainly be interested in slam.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me first finish the discussion about 3S. Many people play the auction 1C-1S-2C-3S is forcing	 and if you want to play that way, it is fine. But, experts play that shows a 10ish point hand with very good spades since new suits by responder are game forcing.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


AT|
EddyHaskel: So, 3S here is a nice invitational hand only? |
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes. And, Vered does have a problem over 2C. I would solve it by bidding 4S. The spades are good enough that they can even play opposite a void: assuming they break 4-3. That is the best description of her hand.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play. The hand should be made. All Vered has to do is draw trumps and play clubs. Don't pitch any clubs on the spades, pitch diamonds. She then takes 6 spades and 5 clubs and makes 11 tricks. However, if she chooses to knock out the Ace of diamonds first then she should not draw trumps, as she needs to retain control of the heart suit. As we saw, by drawing trumps first and then knocking out the DA, she lost a heart trick she should not lose. On this hand there was no reason to knock out the DA. However, on other hands there might be.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, if knocking out the DA was needed, she needs to do that before drawing trumps. There are two main reasons to defer drawing trumps. The most common reason, as most of you know, is so you can ruff in dummy. The other reason, as illustrated in this hand, is so you retain control in a side suit while you knock out the defense high cards. On this hand, you cannot lose the lead when dummy is out of trumps, because you then lose heart tricks.|

^B@2 ^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Reasonable Marge. However, I am not one of those suit preference people. I play attitude, even with a singleton on the board. I was trying to tell Marge that I did not particularly want her to switch--played a high club. If I wanted her to switch I play a low club. And it is pretty obvious, looking at dummy, that a heart is the correct switch. So, that is why I do not like suit preference in that situation. But again, many experts disagree with me (what else is new, lol).|

^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||fp|2|at|5H is the correct answer. 5D is asking about the Queen of spades, since you have it, you bid 5H, your cheapest King. The rule is you make the cheapest bid you can make to show your King. And 5H is certainly cheaper than 6C. Granted, the example is unusual in that it is rare you can show your cheapest King without forcing the hand to slam, but the rule still applies. If you bid 6C, you are denying the K of hearts. It is really no different in concept than control bidding, where if the auction goes, for example, 1D-1H-3H, your cheapest control bid is 3S (not 4C), and if you bid 4C, you are denying a spade control.

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

I suggest you familiarize your self with all the function of icons both at the top of the Viewer screen and at the bottom of BBO page. The "HELP" icon in both the Viewer and the BBO has all the information needed to navigate in this presentation.  

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals are presented in a closed format. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards. The links in this file are clickable. Simply click it if you wish to visit the site.  |
