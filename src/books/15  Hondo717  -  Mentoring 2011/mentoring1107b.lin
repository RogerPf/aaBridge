^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

It is rarely right to let the opponents play at the 2 level, when you know they have an 8+ card fit. You should strain to make a bid, especially in the balancing seat.

So, you should not bid 3 over 3 unless a) you have a 9 card fit or b) you have a singleton or void in the opponents suit. Since I have 6 spades and Noah promised 3, I could and should bid 3S, although I am not happy about my flattish distribution. Stan may have found the winning bid.|

NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That guarantees I make 9 tricks. Therefore, let me analyze the hearts for the the tenth trick. One way to try for an extra heart trick is to play Stan for the KQ of hearts. But that is only 25% that he has both. Another way to play it is to play Stan for K10 or Q10 or KQ10. That turns out to be better odds, because there are 3 combinations of cards where it works. So the best way to play this heart suit is to lead low to the 9. If Stan has the King I am all set.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Stan made another good bid. Kia is only promising 4 hearts, so they might be in an 8 card fit and normally, as I said before, "3 over 3" is not a good idea with an 8 card fit. However, Stan has a singelton club, so that makes 3 hearts an acceptable bid. Additionally, on a good day, Kia will have 5 hearts. He only promised 4, but he could have 5 on this auction.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's first discuss DONT. Bergen recommends that you show a single suited hand only when you have a six card suit. I don't happen to agree. I think you can do it with a reasonable 5 card suit. And having said that Bergen also says "any suit with 4 honors can be counted as having 1 card extra length." So since Eileen's heart suit has 4 honors, Bergen says it is ok to treat it as a six card suit. I would bid DONT even lacking the @H10. I think DONT is an extremely effective convention, so I use it with any excuse.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The distribution is more important than the length, but here are my guidelines. If you have a six card suit that you would open a weak-2, it is ok to show a single suited hand. If you are 5-5 you can have as little as 7 HCP where your points are in your suit. If you are 5-4 you should tend to have a bit more, say 10 or 11. And with an opening hand, I sometimes do it even with 4-4, if both my suits are good suits.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is also a slight modification to DONT that some people play. Some people play 2H is a single suited heart hand. If they play that, then Eileen would bid 2H which is slightly more informative and preemptive. Also if you play that, then with spades and hearts, you have to double and then bid 2H. That variation is more complicated and I recommend you stick to the original version but make sure you use it aggressively.|

However, as I get older I become more persistent and keep writing on the sand--reviewing the material over and over. This week I have a gem by Eric Rodwell. It is part of a series of articles by Eric on 2/1 game force. Eric is a world-class player and theorist. Other articles in the series can be found at ^*Hwww.betterbridge.com/articles^*N.

This is the only 2/1 auction where responder immediately shows a major. Raising partners major when there is a known eight-card or longer fit is a top priority in any situation. Since responders 2H bid promises at least a five-card suit, opener raises with three-card or longer support. |
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT||sk||NT|^B@2
Note that opener raises the major instead of bidding notrump, even with a balanced hand. The partnership wants to find an eight-card major suit fit even when opener is balanced. Opener doesnt need an honor in hearts to raise, only three-card or longer support. 4H is a much better contract than 3NT, which would fail on a diamond lead.|MB|4hPPP|

Responder doesnt guarantee a five-card suit for a response of 2C or 2D. Also, game in a minor suit is usually less attractive than game in notrump. So four-card support is normally expected to raise responders minor, although opener can raise with strong three-card support and a suit-oriented hand. |Sk||
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT|^B@2
South has only three-card support for responders minor, but with all the high cards in hearts and clubs, raises to 3C. This will encourage North to continue to the excellent slam. |

Opener should always show a second five-card suit or a four-card heart suit. Whether opener should show a side four-card minor suit depends on both the quality of the suit and the convenience of showing it.|

If South doesnt show the club suit on the rebid, even with a minimum strength opening bid, there is little chance the excellent 6C contract will be reached. The partnership might land in a poor 3NT or 4H. |

With this hand it is convenient for South to make the natural rebid showing the second suit. Pinpointing the potential weakness in spades might steer the partnership away from 3NT into the excellent 5C.|sk||

The partnership misses its 4-4 club fit, but thats a good thing. 3NT is a fine spot; 5C has almost no chance.|

With rare exceptions, a rebid of openers suit shows a six-card or longer suit. Although South has three-card support for responders minor, the priority is to show the six-card major. Its the length thats important, not the strength.|

With 6-4 distribution, opener usually bids the four-card suit in preference to rebidding the six-card suit, unless the four-card suit is very weak or cannot be shown at the two level. Opener can later rebid the first suit to show a six-card suit.|
PG| ***** 100 ***** |


sk||mb|2np3sp4sppp|NT|^B@2
When opener shows the second suit, responder can suggest notrump as the best spot. Opener now rebids the six-card major, and the partnership lands in its eight-card fit. Notice that this is a comfortable auction in 2/1. Responder doesnt need to jump to 3NT on the second bid, since 2NT is forcing. Both partners have an opportunity to describe their hand.|
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Some authorities recommend that opener rebid the six-card major first with a minimum opening, and only bid the four-card suit on the rebid when holding extra values. That approach has some merit, but the suggested approach makes things clearer in an auction like next.|

Yes, with 6 spades and 4 hearts, if the auction goes 1S-2 minor, I will bid 2H rather than 2S. But with 6 hearts or spades and 4 diamonds, if the auction goes 1 major - 2C, I will tend to bid 2 major with a six card suit rather than 2D.|CP||

Since the 2S rebid denies a four-card heart suit, opener can conveniently show some strength in hearts at the third opportunity, allowing responder to confidently bid 3NT.|

If opener cant support responders suit, doesnt have a second suit to bid, and doesnt have a six-card or longer suit to rebid, opener bids 2NT. |

South shows a balanced hand with the 2NT rebid, and the partnership easily reaches the best spot. |
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Although South will usually have a minimum balanced hand for a 2NT rebid, it only describes the shape, not the strength. With a balanced hand of 18-19 points, for example, opener would still rebid 2NT, planning to show the extra strength later. Does opener need stoppers (more on that later) in the unbid suits to bid 2NT? Suppose opener has next hand.|

Although some authorities insist that opener must have a stopper in any unbid suit to rebid 2NT after a 2/1 response, consider the alternatives. Opener cant support responders clubs with only a doubleton. Opener cant bid a new suit with only three cards. (Opener can bid a three-card minor in some situations, such as after a forcing 1NT response, but not in this situation.) A 2S rebid would show a six-card suit. So the recommendation is:|

The partnership reaches 3NT when neither player has a diamond stopper. Still, 3NT is the best contract. The defenders may not lead a diamond, the missing diamonds might be divided 4-3, or the suit might be blocked. After a 2/1 game forcing response, openers 2NT rebid doesnt guarantee a stopper in the unbid suits. |

^-|cs||cp||at|^B@2^Z@3
A stopper is a value that will, or likely will, stop the opponents from taking all the tricks in a suit they lead. An Ace is obviously a stopper, as is KQ or QJ10. Since the opening lead comes around to declarers hand, a holding such as QJ2 would also be a stopper. Many other holdings serve as a stopper in the same way: K2, K32, KJ, KJ2. Even if a holding like this doesnt win a trick  because the opponents dont lead the suit at trick one , they must lead something else, which might give declarer time to develop tricks in other suits. Some holdings such as Q2, J32, or 10754, are called a ½ stopper. If partner has a similar holding, the combine holdings make  a full stopper.|

CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play double dummy, you see all four handsits great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to take it. Now, you may lead the next cardfrom the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. Now, please click |cp|1|AT|^*GR1, RETURN^*N |CP||AT|to return to your original location.|
