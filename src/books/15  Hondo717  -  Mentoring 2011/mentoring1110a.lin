{      Beginner Intermediate Lounge, Our Home      }
^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|Howard's undoes are bridge legends. There are of several varieties: a quick undo followed by his silence, an undo followed by a question, and finally a player's request for undo after Howard making the error apparent. Those undoes, however, are not reflected in the final version of the file. In most parts we try to bring you all of them as we believe they really are the teaching points we never will forget. The next several are good examples. Of course a particular board would never see the daylight if the "Movie Maker" is on the receiving end of an undo and the error is BAAD. Now, please see the first type.|

NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it turns out they do have the points for 3N. However, even if Bonnie leads a heart, when she gets in with the CK, we have a chance to cash our spades and set 3N. That does not change the fact that Joan was a bit too strong to balance with 1N. Sometimes, with a bad balanced 15 points, I might bid 1N as a slight underbid. But on this hand, Joan has a really strong hand with 3 Aces and a quality suit.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, you could make a case for double and correct. However, when partner jumps to 2S or 3S, Joan will not be happy. So, I think 2D is ok. Spencer should consider raising 2D to 3D right away, to make it hard for me to compete. I am not likely to come in, but if I have a  weak hand with, say six spades, I might bid 2S. Bonnie should know I have less than six having passed originally.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Finally let's go over what to lead from KJ10 once more. Generally, you should avoid leading the suit, as it often gives away a trick. But if you feel it is the best lead, in a suit contract the J is the correct lead (top of an honor sequence). |
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In NT, many people play "coded 10s and 9s". That means, in NT only, they lead the 10 from KJ10. The reason being, if they lead the J it denies anything higher, whereas if they lead the 10, it is often from a broken sequence (AJ10 or KJ10).|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this particular hand, Bonnie has no obvious good lead. I would have chosen a diamond myself, although a heart did not really hurt.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am assuming from the signaling that Joan has the DA and HA. The only points Spencer has shown up with thus far are the Club Ace-Queen. He could have the HJ. But he did bid 2H, and my dilemma is who had the DJ. So, since I can only account for 7 points in Spencer's hand, I am playing him for the DJ.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding needs some discussion. Many people like to play light third seat openers and Joan is 5/5, and has 19 using the rule of 20 (9 Adjusted HCP + 10 cards in two longest suits). So her hand qualifies as a light third seat opener. The theory behind light third seat openers is that if it goes Pass - Pass and  you have a relatively weak hand then it is likely that 4th seat has a good hand. Therefore, by opening you make it harder for fourth seat to bid.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I personally do not like them, because I find it hard as responder to figure out how much to bid if I am afraid partner has too weak a hand. But they are certainly played by many experts.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bonnie has a good takeout double, classic in fact. Spencer should bid 3H, not 2H. In general, making a weak jump raise to 3 is a very good tactic. Now should Bonnie bid 4S? Probably not.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have at most 12 Declarer Points, and she has 13 Bergen Dummy Points--13 HCP, -1 for KQ of hearts + 1 for doubleton. It's close, but I might only have 11, and the KQ of hearts don't rate to fit well with my hand. I would tend to pass. Although there are certainly hands I could have where 4S makes, particularly if I have a 5 card suit.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT|^B@2
xXx_Cpt: Howard, have you come up with a solution to combine Bergen hand evaluation and Rule of 20.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes Spencer. You use "adjusted HCP" to calculate the Rule of 20. "Adjusted HCP" are the Bergen starting point rules (raw HCP, dubious shortness, quality suits, adjust3) except for length. So when calculating whether you have a rule of 20 opener, you take your adjusted HCP plus 2 longest suits, if they equal 20 you have an opener.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Basically the hand cannot be made. First of all Bonnie should just be resigned to down 1, losing the 2 minor suit aces, and probably 4 hearts. Her best line is to knock out the minor suit Aces and take her 7 tricks (2 spades, 1H, 2C, and 2 diamonds).|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good question by Noah. As it turns out, 4S is also down 1, losing 1 trick in each suit. However, I hate to pass 2N particularly in IMPs. My feeling is, it is pretty much only right when you make exactly 2N. I probably do bid 3C with Spencer's hand, New Minor Forcing, and take 3S to 4S.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, one little known fact is that it is better to play 0314 when your agreed suit is a minor. The reason is, in clubs, you want to be able to stop in 5C if I have 0 Aces sometimes. Actually in general I like 0314 better, but no one plays that. But I will respond 1430 here.|

^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. Now, please click |cp|1|AT|^*GR1, RETURN^*N |CP||AT|to return to your original location.|
