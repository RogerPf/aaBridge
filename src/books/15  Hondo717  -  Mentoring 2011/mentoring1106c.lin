^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Assuming we accept the existing bidding, let's see what I should do. If my spades and hearts were reversed, I would have a clear 5D bid. I am assuming from Ann's bid that she has at least 5 diamonds, as the law says she should not bid 4D without a 5 card suit. It is quite possible we have 2 spade losers, but I doubt we are setting 4S, so, given the distributional nature of my hand, 5D seems right at equal vulnerability (or favorable -- we not vul-they vul).

^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nice defense by Kim giving Eileen the club ruff. Now, let's talk about the bidding. Ann does not have a rule of 20 opener although she is close. I probably would overcall 1S with Eileen's hand, although pass is reasonable. I like to lay claim to the spade suit in a competitive auction. The 3D and 3S bids are fine. 4D is somewhat questionable.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First of all, Ann should assume I have 5D, so we only have a 9 card fit, meaning it does not follow the law. Second, you always have to be cautious about bidding 4 of a minor in a competitive auction, because you might push them into a making game they would not bid on their own. However, in Ann's defense, the singleton spade is a very good feature, so 4D has some merit. On the other hand, what it did do was cause me to bid 5, because I assumed a 10 card fit, and added extra for my distribution.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We were a bit unlucky going down 3, but if we only go down 2 they might not make 4S. This hand illustrates that if you follow the law, you tend to do well.|

PG| ***** 18 ***** |

^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Super play Dorothy. The technique towards the end of the hand that Dorothy used was known as a "trump coup." If the dummy is out of trump and need to finesse your opponent for trump, sometimes you can do the following: If the opponent ruffs you overruff; If the defender pitches, you pitch.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let me discuss the auction. I should bid 1S, not 1N. I decided with 11 Bergen Dummy Points I had a 3-card limit raise. One way to show that is to bid a forcing 1N followed by a jump in opener's major, if you play 2 over 1 which is what I did. However, 1N over 1H denies a 4 card spade suit, even in 2 over 1.|

NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Dorothy's 2D bid over 1N was fine, she is too weak to bid 3D. Her other possible bid is 2N, which shows 17 or 18 typically.|

PG| ***** 39 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You are reasonably balanced. The problem with 2D is, although it is fine, it shows a large range from 12-17 points. 2N narrows the range of your hand a bit better.|

dae: Wouldn't that show too MUCH to open 1N?|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you play that you open 1N with a 5 card major, then 2N is often done with 2 doubletons and it shows a good 16 to 18. With 19 you should bid 3N.|

liz1815: Why did you not support her hearts at first?|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because I am too strong to bid 2H, and 3H promises 10-12 with 4 card support. With 10+ and 3 card support, you have to bid another suit first and then jump in hearts. However, your instinct should always be to "support with support" ASAP.|

^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Stan has a 1D opener, unless he plays short club. And if he does, he must alert. "Could be as few as 2 clubs" is the best way to alert. Some people play a "short club" so when they open 1D they promise 4. I personally do not like to play that. And if you do play that, then responder should still pass with less than six points, regardless of how many clubs they have. Interestingly, many people who play short club panic when their partner opens 1C and they have less than six points.|

^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us discuss what Joan should do. She has 12 HCP, + 1 length point, -1 Jx of clubs, and -1 for having  4 quacks and only 1 Ace for a total of 11 Declarer Points. Partner could have as much as 15 or 16 (in Bergen points a jump to 3H promises 17-19 dummy points). So, she should bid 3H invitational. Another point for Joan bidding 3H is that it is likely her side has a 9-card fit. In most instances it shows 4-card support when partner raises. Occasionally, with the right hand, 3 good hearts and shortness, he will raise with 3, but Joan should assume 4. So let us change her bid and experiment a bit more.|

^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Actually, Joan's bid is fine, but we will discuss the other options. She has 17 HCP plus 1 length point and plus 2 quality suit points, for a total of 20 Starting Points. Had she had fewer points, 2H is a reasonable bid over 1H. However, she has a game force. She cannot bid 4H (or 4C splinter) with only 3 hearts. So her best bid is 2S. She will then support hearts later, showing 3 card support and a likely 4-3-5-1 shape.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT|^B@2
stanira3: Is 2S a reverse?|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2S is a jump shift. Although, here, they both bids work but are slightly different. A jump shift is jumping the suit bid 1 extra level. So, instead of bidding 1S, 2S is a jump shift, as it is a jump in the suit bid. A reverse is bidding past your first suit at the 2 level.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, if the auction goes, for example, 1D-1S-2H (not on this hand) that is a reverse. She is not jumping in hearts but is bidding past 2D. A reverse is strong, at least 16 or so, but a jump shift is stronger. To repeat what I have said, 2S by Joan (a jump shift) establishes a game force but a reverse does not establish a game force. It is forcing for one round. On this hand Joan is strong enough to jump shift. On a previous hand, Dorothy, having 17, was not strong enough to jump shift to 3D so she bid 2D.|

^-|CP||FP||at|^B@2^Z@3Bridge information stays with me as long as writing on the sand at the beach. It takes only one soft wave to wash everything away. However, as I get older I become more persistent and keep writing on the sand--reviewing the material over and over. This week I have an interesting read on "Duplicate Strategy" playing problems. It is part of chapter IX, Part II of ^*IThe Play of the Hand at Bridge^*N by Louis H. Watson. |

^-{ Duplicate Strategy }
^-|cp||FP||at|^B@2^Y@3T|FP||AT|he differences between play at Duplicate Bridge and play at Rubber Bridge are not as great as the differences in bidding. Play at team-of-four matches, which are always scored at total points, is approximately the same as at Rubber bridge, but match point play for pairs, either by the Howell or the Mitchell method, is sometimes quite different. For example, a player who has reached a contract of four spades might on occasion risk getting set when his bid is assured, merely for the sake of obtaining an extra trick. This extra trick, which counts only 30 points in regular Bridge, can very easily give him a top score on the board. |

This is not generally good policy, however, and a play of this type should not be made unless the percentages are very much in favor of its success, or unless the pair has so bad a score at the moment that very desperate measures are required. With a good score, the tendency should be to play for average and let the other pairs worry about the tops.|

The other main difference revolves around the fact that a pair is often liable to get into the wrong contract. For instance, suppose that you found yourself at one no-trump and saw immediately that the hand was a lay-down for three hearts. If it seemed that most other teams would play the hand at hearts, you would then be forced to try desperate means to make-not two no-trump, as this would count only 70 as against the 90 produced by three hearts-but three no-trump!|

Even if you went down in the process, this loss would probably involve very few match points. However, if the hand were such that it seemed likely that most pairs would reach four hearts and go down one, then the best thing to do would be to play safe and assure yourself of a plus score. So far as technique--attack or defense--is concerned, it is the same in Duplicate Bridge as in Rubber Bridge.|

Movie Maker|CP||AT|: To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the Undo link on the top left. This link is only available during double dummy play. To cancel double dummy play, click on any of the navigation links.
