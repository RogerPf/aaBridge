^-|CP||fp|2|ht|g|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is no reason to do that. It is usually not a good idea to ruff in the long hand. All you do is shorten your trump. It often is a good idea to ruff in the short hand before drawing trump--the short hand is most often dummy. So, if you wanted to ruff something in dummy before drawing trump, that might be okay.  However, but there is almost never a good reason to ruff in the long hand, unless you lack entries. I will give you undo.|

However, if I want to make a "passive" defensive play (ie not giving anything away), making Lisa ruff is an excellent passive play. It may be wrong on a specific hand if I have something better, but on this hand I don't.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The play was fine on this hand. Nothing extra to talk about. However, the bidding is another matter. First let's see if Lisa should make a game try (which is what 3H is). Let's count her Bergen Declarer Points. She has 14 HCP plus 1 length point for 15 starting points. Once Roberta raises spades, she can do some declarer addons--1 for the 4 card heart side suit, and 1 for the 2 doubletons--that gives her 17. Playing Bergen evaluation, you need 26 points for game. So, if Roberta is at the top of her range, they have enough points for game. Therefore, Lisa's bid is reasonable, but optional.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the plus side, she has all "prime" high cards, meaning Aces and Kings. On the minus side, she has reasonably flat distribution (no singletons or voids). In general, for thin games, you should strongly prefer to have unbalanced distribution. Nevertheless, a game try is certainly not out of the question with Lisa's hand, just a tad optimistic.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, what about Roberta? Let's count her dummy points. She has 8 Starting points. Once Lisa bids 1S she can count 1 for her club doubleton--that is 9 Dummy Points. Her 3@D bid shows 7-9 which puts her at the top of her range. Therefore, she should accept Lisa's invitation, as her hand is as good as it gets and bid 4@S. Her hand doesn't look so hot in general. But once you limit yourself to 7-9, it is at the top of the range. Now, having said that, although 4S makes, it actually is not a very good game. 4S depends on a lot of good things happening. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here, you have 3 sure losers--2 hearts and a club. That means you cannot lose anything else. Therefore: 
a) you need the CA onside, b) You need the Q of spades to be singleton or doubleton and, and c) you need hearts to split 3-2. If you showed me those 2 hands and asked if I wanted to be in 4 spades, I would answer emphatically not. As it is probably less than 20% that it makes. This was a case where Bergen evaluation was a bit optimistic.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As usual, by paying attention to the bidding, I have clues as to how to play the hand.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


AT|
lcmdir: Lovely.  My fear was that you had a bust hand.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^B@2
^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Thank you Anna. We discussed the play. Now let's talk about the bidding.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although Stan technically has a rule of 20 hand, and can open 1S tactically I think it is better, with an 8 card suit and not many HCP to preempt. I would open his hand 4S myself. Here, because of the void in East's hand that does not work out that well, but that is pretty unlucky. Stan would end up losing 1 heart, 1 club and 2 spades and go down 1 which is still better, even doubled than having us make 4H.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is a famous bridge riddle which applies here and goes like this:
"What do you call an 8 card suit?", and the answer is "Trumps" :). The point being that you really want to play in your 8 card suit. But, now lets take the bidding as is and see if Anna should bid 4 hearts or not. One thing she has going for her is the known 9 card fit. When stretching, you tend to be aggressive with a 9 card fit and unaggressive with an 8 card fit. |
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


AT|
lcmdir: Figured Dorothy didn't have much, so hoped you had some points.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Anna you are correct. Let's look at what is going on. Assume Stan has 12 or 13 HCP and Anna has 19. That leaves 9 or 10 between Dorothy and I. Given no additional information, Anna can guess they are split evenly, giving me 4 or 5 points. So, it is likely we are close to making game. Additionally, Anna is well placed behind the opening bidder. Her high cards are more likely to win tricks because Stan is more likely to have the missing high cards. For both those reasons a) our side should be close to having enough HCP to make game and b) Anna's HCP are well placed as well as c) we have a 9 card it. 4H is a very good bid.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If Anna was sitting south, then her high card points are not well placed, because Stan's high cards are in back of her. So, sometimes, the position of  your hand in relation to the strong opponent is a factor that you should consider when deciding how good your hand is.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let's discuss the opening lead. Stan does not have a good lead. A singleton trump often gives away a trick and should be avoided. It is rarely right to lead an unprotected Ace as I have said many times. So, clubs are out. That leaves spades, and leading away from the King-Jack is not appetizing either. I would have led a spade myself (the SJ is the Standard lead) and that actually works well on this hand, as Dorothy scores 2 ruffs.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In fact, if she finds the diamond return, they beat the hand with 2 spade ruffs, a heart ruff, and the CA. But that is not the reason to lead a spade. The reason is, it seems like the least likely to give away a trick. Heart would be my 2nd choice and it could very well be right on many hands.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


AT|
EddyHaskel: Even a singleton?|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As I said Eddy, the singleton trump is normally not a good lead, but neither is leading away from a King-Jack. You just have to decide which of two less than optimal choices is better.|

However, I still don't like my flat hand and because Ann did not raise hearts right away, nor did Marge rebid them, it is likely they have an 8 card fit. You should strain to bid 4S over 4H, but in this case I think I will pass, due to my flat hand, and their likely 8 card fit.|

Despite the fact I like to bid, sometimes (ok, rarely, lol) pass is a good bid for her. When you have already described your hand and have nothing more to say, you should pass. So, in this case, over 2S, even had Ann bid 2D, Marge should pass. That tells Ann a lot. It says Marge does not have another suit to bid and probably does not have six hearts. It also says Marge probably does not have too much in spades.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, before discussing the auction, let me briefly mention a convention that some people play over both Michaels and unusual NT. It is called "unusual over unusual." The basic idea is, if my 2 suits are known, as in this case, then Anna has cue bids in clubs and diamonds available--3@C and 3@D. So, you can reserve cue bids to show stronger hands, and major suit bids, both a spade raise and heart bid, to show weaker hands. That is all I will say about that, but if interested, I suggest you look it up on the Internet.|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


NT|^B@2
dae: That is why I passed. Further, after the unusual NT, if she doubled it would say she could set one of your suits.|
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well Anna did not say she played that convention Dorothy. And you are correct I think she should raise with her hand. However, the problem is Anna is not sure if her diamond cards are worth much and she has a balanced hand. So, ostensibly, although she has 10 HCP + 1 length point + 1 quality suit point + 1 point for the doubleton I am not sure she should consider the DQJ worth 3 points and the 3 little spades is not good either. If you only have an 8 card fit, a 4-1 break is a good possibility. Therefore, I think 3S is a reasonable action.|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now what about Dorothy? She has 15 starting points--13 HCP and 2 length points. Once Anna raises spades, Dorothy knows they have at least a 9 card fit and although Anna is likely to have heart points, I would still add 2 for her singleton heart. I would not add one for her sixth trump, as is usual with Bergen Declarer Points, however. So, she has 17 Declarer Points. I would say on average she should assume Anna has around 8 dummy points. Thus, it is borderline as to whether or not to bid 4.|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


NT|^B@2
dae: How do I KNOW she has 4 trumps?|
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You don't, but you know she has 3, so you have at least a 9 card fit. And because of the 9-card fit and being vulnerable, I probably would bid 4S, but pass is certainly reasonable.|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


at|
guelphdad:  Howard, do you worry about points or just the 5-5 distribution?|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I tend to worry more about the distribution 5/5. I never do it with 5/4, because it messes up my law of total tricks calculations. Further, I might not do it with a real bad hand, but I will often do it with even just 7 or 8 HCP for sure.|

I have 14 Starting Points--12 HCP, 1 quality suit, and 1 length. Once Stan bids 1S I can add 4 points for the void due to 4 trumps giving me 18 Dummy Points. Stan might only have a 4 card spade suit, but he did bid freely. That tends to mean he either has a 5 card suit, or if only a 4 card suit, a good suit and more than a minimum hand. He should pass with a flat 5 or 6 and 4 mediocre spades. So, that means I can assume a min of 7 points, which means we have enough for game. Therefore, I am going to splinter and bid 4D.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us look at the bidding first. Although sometimes you open 2N with an off shape hand, to show your values, generally you should not if you have better alternatives. The two reasons are, a) with a singleton partner may put you in the wrong contract, and b) you might miss a suit slam. As it turns out, 6C has plays although it is hard to bid and play. I would open 1C with Marge's hand, and then jump shift to 2S. That describes her shape and points very well.|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the lead,  Ann has a tough problem. Generally, it is a bad idea to lead a suit the opponents have bid. And Marge did bid spades, and Ginny implicitly bid hearts by bidding Stayman and bidding 3N over 3S. So, I do not fault Ann for not leading a major. However, I think, because her diamonds are better than her clubs, she should lead a diamond. As it turns out, the best lead is a major, particularly a spade, so it did not really matter but I recommend leading your best unbid suit always against NT. |
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One other subtle point. If there is a good chance that opener only has 4 cards in a bid major and you hold 2 honors in that major, especially if you have a 5 card suit sometimes, despite my rule of not leading the opponents suit, a lead of that suit works well. Had Ann had a 5th spade, a low spade could very well work out. But if you stick to my rule about not leading the opponents suit, and leading your best remaining suit, you will do best in the long run. I would not worry about that subtlety I just talked about. Just thought it was interesting, and you might make note of it for future hands to see when it works out.|

NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would rebid 2N on this hand, as you don't have any other good bid. On the previous hand you had good clubs and spades, so there was no need to open 2N. On this hand, all bids are flawed, therefore, I would choose 2N as the most descriptive.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| Okay, discussing the bidding is first. Some of you may remember that on this auction, Marty recommends the "OBAR" approach. OBAR stands for "Opponents Bid and Raise" which is exactly what this auction was. He believes, and I agree, that if it goes 1x-p-2x, you can "pre-balance" if you have something to say. I am not sure Ann's hearts are worthy of bidding but, if she had the same number of points and a sixth heart, they would be. Some people would say that Ann can "double" to show the other 2 suits. That is known as a "responsive double" and if you play those, Ann has a good responsive double, although she does have an extra heart.|
PG| ***** 230 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, even if she made a responsive double (were we playing them) I probably still bid 3D. It turns out 4 hearts has plays, but it is far from cold, as Ann has to worry about doing something with all her clubs.|
PG| ***** 231 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, there is one good point here. I am sure you noticed I ducked the first spade. That was a very important play. Because, if the opponents start trump and take my trumps off the board, I still have spades controlled. And if they don't play trump, I still have time to ruff my losing spade as I did. As it turns out, if Ginny plays 2 rounds of trump, I end up making 4 or 5. The heart lead was better. However, the key play was ducking the first spade.|

However, as I get older I become more persistent and keep writing on the sand--reviewing the material over and over. This week I had no time for sand writing--eight brads to deal with. |

cp|8|fp||at|^C@2^z@3What  :|CP||FP||AT|  This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are condensed from the chat logs. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I am one of Howard's students. |cp|8|at|

Why   :|CP||FP||AT|  I like to have a record representing the session as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it.|CP|8|AT|

Goal  :|CP||FP||AT|  The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. |CP|8|AT|

Notes :|CP||FP||AT|  Unlike the live play here you see all hands. Further, at the end of each deal, the viewer would be able to play it|CP|8|FP|2|AT| double dummy|CP||FP||AT| or click the forward arrow and move to the next board. When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it.

I suggest you familiarize your self with all the function of icons both at the top of the Viewer screen and at the bottom of BBO page. The "HELP" icon in both the Viewer and the BBO has all the information needed to navigate in this presentation.  

To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some deals are presented in a closed format. To open any board click that seat. Another click opens all boards.

The links in this file are clickable. Simply click it if you wish to visit the site.  Anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at| HELP |cp||at|button in the BBO tool bar or at the top of the Viewer to launch the help section.|HT|Z|AT|
