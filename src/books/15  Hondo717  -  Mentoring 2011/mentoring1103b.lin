^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As I said, 2H was a reasonable choice by Ginny. Had Mei ann  been vulnerable, that argues a bit more for double, as setting her two would be a great result, and setting her one would be good as well. Even making 1N doubled is not terrible as that is not game--with 9+ points and a reasonably balanced hand, you can double. Further, Ginny, you played the hand well. The only thing you might consider is playing for split club honors (e.g. Marge to have one club honor). Then you might get to pitch a losing diamond.|

^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Always lead the top of an honor sequence. A from AK, K from KQ, Q from QJ, and J from J10. In general, you use the same leads when leading partner's suit as with any suit. The only exception is if you have not explicitly supported the suit. In that case, even from 3 small you should lead count, as count is more important than attitude. On hands where you supported, then you can lead high from 3 small, since partner knows you have 3 or more.

^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I am sure most of you are wondering about my double. I am sure you remember the approach to OBAR, "opponents bid and raise." I am sort of "pre balancing" since I am short in diamonds. Further, I am a passed hand, so Ginny won't take me for too many points. The idea is you never let the opponents play at the 2 level when they have found a fit. By doubling I wanted to let Ginny know she could bid any suit and as you see it worked well for us. Also, note that it is much more difficult if they play inverted minors. If it goes 1D-P-3D, I will not double. I am aggressive, but even I have certain standards, lol.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general Ginny played the hand well except for a fairly minor misstep. As she noted afterward she should just trump the second diamond. That way she retains control of the diamond suit.|

PG| ***** 44 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Playing 2/1 I could have as much as 11. I certainly can't have enough for us to want to be in slam. 3H is a slight underbid, as I could pass that with 6 to 8. There is a common misconception about the auction 1x-P-1N-P-3x as we have here. The jump rebid in your suit (e.g 1H-1N-3H) is not forcing. It shows a medium hand (16ish) and partner often passes unless they have at least 8. Mei ann  has a tough decision. |
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although her heart suit is good enough, I am not sure she is quite strong enough to bid 4H particularly since she has 2 "dubious doubletons", meaning her Qx and Jx are not good holdings. So, 3H is probably best. And with 11 points, I have a clear bid of 4.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, Mei ann is not in charge of this hand. She has told her story--good hearts and 16ish points. She is slightly stronger, but only a point or two. I may be stretching to bid 4H for all she knows.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |

FM75:  When you do not respond in major, but NT, can't she at least promote the QT from dubious?|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Perhaps Fred (FM75). But the point is, if you make a bid that shows a good hand, you have told your story. And once you tell your story, if partner underbids, that is partner's problem not yours. Don't bid your values twice. Assume partner heard you the first time :).|

^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One comment on the opening lead. In general, it is risky to lead away from Kings and Queens. Sometimes it can work out well, but generally, unless you have a good reason, you should avoid that lead. Since Mei ann  is the one with the strong hand, that makes it even more risky. With Marge's hand I would make a more neutral lead--either a trump or a diamond. Even if Ginny has diamond cards, they are finessable anyway so the diamond lead is not likely to give anything away.|

^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, the auction greatly improved my hand. We have a known 9+ card heart fit, as Marge's bid promises 5+ hearts and my singleton club is really valuable once Ginny bids 2C. Let's count my Bergen Dummy Points--14 HCP, deduct 1 for the worthless CJ, and add 3 for the singleton club for a total of 16. Since Marge has at least 10 points, I am strong enough to bid 4H. On the other hand, since I have a singleton club, I can splinter rather than just bid 4H. A splinter always shows game forcing values and shortness, and that is what I have.|

Here you do not want any spade ruffs. On many hands you need to ruff something in dummy so you don't pull trump first. But the general rule is to pull trumps unless you have a good reason not to.|

^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, let's talk about the philosophy of splinter bids. Splinters are designed to let you bid thin slams when you have a good fit. So, if someone splinters they are not showing extra values. They are merely showing a game forcing hand with shortness and 4+ card support. For example the auction 1H-4C only promises an opening hand, with 4+ hearts and a singleton or void in clubs. Similarly, my auction promised 16 points (game forcing with Marge's 10) 4+ hearts and a singleton club.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, what does Marge need to be interested in slam. Well if she has a real good hand, 16+, then she should be interested in slam regardless, as I promised 16. But with less than that, then she should only try for slam with a good fit. A good fit means no wasted club values. The best holding in clubs is 3 or 4 small. The next best holding is Axx or Axxx. Anything other than that, as here with wasted @CQ, with a min hand Marge should just bid 4H.|

^-|HT|f|CP||FP||at|^B@2^Z@3Bridge information stays with me as long as writing on the sand at the beach. It takes only one soft wave to wash everything away. However, as I get older I become more persistent and keep writing on the sand--reviewing the material over and over. This week I have two for the price of one. The first, opening 1NT with 5-card major, is what I really dig and follow. The second, coded Jacks and Tens, which I have no place in my brain for it and only mention it here for those aspiring bridge students. Without further ado let us look at one of the boards played during Howard's recent mentoring session discussing both.|

^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is some controversy about whether to open 1NT with a balanced 15-17 and a 5 card major. I think the majority consensus is that you should open 1N, and I certainly agree. The problem is, if you open 1S, you have a rebid problem. Let me change my bid to 1S and see what happens.|

nt||ub||mb|1sp1np|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The most likely auction is 1S-P-1N. That means you have to rebid 2N (which may be too high) or pass 1N (which may be too low). Further, the NT is played from the wrong side if you open my hand 1S. The basic issue is it is difficult to show the point count of a 15-17 point hand when you open 1 of a suit. You are not strong enough to jump shift, but you would like to show more than a minimum.

The standard lead from AJ10 and KJ10 is the J. Further, the standard lead from J10 is also the J. So, partner is not sure when you lead the J whether or not you have the A or K. One way to solve that is to play coded 10s. If you play coded 10s, then the lead of the 10 shows one of two possible holdings--it either shows the broken sequence AJ10 or KJ10 or it is top of nothing, 109. Partner can usually work out which it is, as the J is often visible when partner leads the 10 from 109.|

NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, that is why people play "coded 10s" to differentiate between AJ10 and KJ10. If you play that then the lead of the J denies a higher honor. Also coded 10s only apply when defending NT. Some people shorthand coded 10s by saying the 10 shows 0 or two higher. That is correct, but not complete because for example if you have AQ10x you do not lead the 10, even though you have 2 higher.|

NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, coded 10s show either a broken sequence or nothing higher than the 10. Similarly, you can play "coded 9s." Then you lead 9 from Q109 K109 or A109 and you lead 9 from 9xx. Therefore, the 9 shows a broken sequence with the 10, or nothing higher. One other point. From QJ10 you still lead the Q, not the 10 because that is not the broken sequence of AJ10 or KJ10. The Q is clear, it shows a sequence headed by the Q. If you are still not clear on the concept of coded 10s and 9s, you can read my opening leads tutorial or write to me.|

at|^c@2^Y@3This is a movie of the hands from Howard's recent mentoring sessions with his recommendations and comments to his mentees which are condensed from the chat log. Howard has approved the bridge information presented here. I like to have a record representing the sessions as close to the live events as possible for my later review. I am delighted that Howard is sending you this movie and you can also enjoy it. The emphasis is capturing Howard's teaching and not correctness of the grammar or the spelling or the beauty of the graphics. 

When available there is an explanation for the bids in the gray box. To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. To enhance the teaching value of this movie, some boards are presented in a closed format. To open any hand click that seat. Another click opens all hands. ^*BThe links in this file are clickable^*N. Simply click it if you wish to visit the site.
