^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

PG| ***** 7 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this auction, Elizabeth is right. In this auction a club is a good lead and a heart is a second choice. It is usually not right to lead a suit the opponents have bid. Further, the reason it is right to lead a trump is, I have shown 2 suits and partner has taken a preference. Fred, being long in my first suit should try and cut down ruffs in dummy. In general, if opener bids 2 suits, and responder shows a clear preference, a trump lead is often correct and should be strongly considered. However, let me play the hand with this opening lead.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is an easy hand to play. If I draw 2 rounds of trump, most likely I will lose 1S and 1C and maybe 1 diamond, as I will be able to ruff out the diamonds to set up the suit. So, I will defer drawing trumps for a second, to take the diamond finesse, and then draw trumps afterwards.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, by planning and not drawing trump prematurely, I was able to take the most tricks I could. I would like to discuss Ann's question about forcing bids. There is a common misconception about forcing bids. It is true that a new suit by responder is forcing. So, as long as Ann keeps bidding new suits I cannot pass. However, the same is not true of opener. A new suit by opener is not forcing. If opener wants to force responder to bid, opener must either jump shift or reverse.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I wanted to force Ann to bid I would have to bid (on a different hand of course) either 2H  or 3C. This makes sense if you think about it. Opener often has a weakish hand, and if responder has a weakish response, you don't want to get too high. So, new suits by opener are not forcing if they are not a reverse or jump shift. Having said that, responder must still be careful because opener can have as much as 17 (as I did on this hand) and still not jump shift. Therefore, with 9+ responder should still take another bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One other advertisement for the hondo style of weak-2s. Had Elizabeth opened a weak-2 (most people other than me would not), I would bid 3D, which turns out to be a bad contract.|

up|52|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss 2 things here. First, when to bid 3S vs 4S with 3 card support when pard opens a weak-2. By the law of total tricks, you always should bid at least 3 with 3 cards support (9  card fit). However, on this hand I had 19 HCP, so even with a minimum weak-2, we have enough points for game. Therefore, 4S was clear.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With say 15 or 16 points, I would use the Ogust 2N bid. After a 2NT (Ogust bid), partner would bid 3H or 3S with 8-10, so with 15 I would go to 4. But the more important rule is, if pard opens a weak-2, always raise to 3 at least with 3 card support.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now as to the lead. Many people advocate King from King-Queen as a strong lead against suits. However, my experience is that it often works out badly. I avoid leading it if I have a better choice. On this hand, particularly with @CKQ10, I might very well lead a club, as South is more likely to have the @CA. And even if declarer has the @CJ, it doesn't matter.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, on this hand it did not hurt. But in general it is to be avoided, and without the @C10 I definitely lead a spade.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's see if there is any chance we have game. Since Ann only bid 2H (not 3) I know we have an 8 card fit, which makes me more cautious. My Starting points are 13--12 HCP - 1 for Jx + 2 length points. With declarer add ons of 2 for singleton and 1 for side diamonds, I have 16 Declarer Points. It is not quite enough for game, especially with only an 8 card fit. So, 3H is the best bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You need to go through the same exercise as I did Eileen. You have 20 Starting Points	to which you can add one Dummy Point for @DK5 doubleton for a total of 21. Kia has to have at least six or so. Thus, the partnership has at least 27 combined points. That is enough for game. Remember, if you know you have game, it is your responsibility to bid it.|

If I take my Ace I am giving Kia 2 heart tricks. And if I don't take my Ace, I may never get it. Since it is hopeless that we are beating the hand, I think I will go for our maximum tricks and take my Aces.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once again some slight overbidding worked out well. Kia's 2S is aggressive. However, Eileen is likely to have 4 spades. Assuming that is true, as declarer he can count 4 HCP, 1 length point, 2 for singleton heart (which is very valuable) and 1 for 4 card diamond side suit. So, his hand is worth around 8 in spades and 2S, a tad aggressive, is  not as bad as you might think.|

PG| ***** 81 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3S does not show a weak hand. 3S asks Eileen to bid 4 if she has more than a minimum. It shows around 11 or 12. Note, Eileen has not overcalled spades. Granted she should have spades.|

There are 2 criteria you can choose from to decide whether or not to open 2C . One is Howard's "9 trick" rule. If you think your hand can take 9 tricks you can open 2C. As Eileen has 7 spades and 2 hearts, it meets that rule.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 2nd rule is Bergen's "4 and 4" rule. If your hand has 4+ quick tricks and 4 or fewer losers, you can open 2C. Bergen does not use losing trick count. He just attempts to calculate losers. On this hand, Eileen has 4 clear losers (1 H, 1C, 2D) and with AK in both majors, also has 4 quick tricks. So, it counts as a Bergen 2C bid as well.|

NT||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Oh, we have a teaching moment:). Experts play the following when there is interference after 2C. They play bids are natural. Double is a very weak hand (no Aces or Kings) and pass shows some values (at least a King or so). On this hand, I would have had to pass and we end up in 4S anyway. But that approach is somewhat confusing to many people (double being weaker than pass). I am not sure I recommend you play that.|

@D@D nome: Now, if you wish, you can play this hand double dummy. The opening lead was the club 3, however, you can choose a different lead. Just click any card from that hand. When finished or if not interested in the double dummy feature please move to the next section.|

However, as I get older I become more persistent and keep writing on the sand--reviewing the material over and over. This week I have an interesting read on "Holding up with King-Queen and with Queen-Jack" in No-Trump play. It is part of chapter IX, Part II of ^*IThe Play of the Hand at Bridge^*N by Louis H.

The whole point of the hand occurs right away: ^*I South must allow Jack to hold the first trick.^*N He knows that by doing so he abandons all chance of making 2 spade tricks, but he also saves himself from being set if East has only two spades and the King of diamonds.|

After the hold-up, West can either continue spades or shift to hearts. It makes no difference which, as his hand is shut out of the play completely from this point on. Note that if South wins the first trick with his Queen of spades,|

AT| This hold-up, or ducking of the first trick, is really a sort of safety play, for it is made to protect the Declarer against a possible spade doubleton plus the King of diamonds on his right. Let us look at another example.|

PG| ***** 135 ***** |


sc|y|NT|^B@2
The hand just given also has another interesting point. If East had played the Ten of spades instead of the Ace on the first trick, South would have been put in a bad spot. If South thought East was deliberately holding back either the Ace or the King, he should duck, of course. However, if both the Ace and the King should be in the West hand, the duck will be a losing play as East can come through the Declarer twice.|
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, the Ten of spades on the first trick is an almost impossible play for East to make, since West might be leading from the King-Jack, when the Ten simply loses a trick to an unguarded Queen. Taking everything into consideration, the play of the Ten by East is a little far-fetched, but with the play of the Ace on the first trick the subsequent play by the Declarer was marked.|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Another variation of a hold-up, which is an exception to a rule learned in Part I, occurs when you are desirous of keeping a certain hand out of the lead. The following deal illustrates a hold-up when the King and Queen are divided between two hands:|

The seven of spades is opened by west, against South's contract of three no-trump.|
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


AT| As explained in part I, Declarer's best chance of obtaining 2 tricks in spades lies in going up with the Queen in Dummy. In this particular case, however, he is not interested in 2 spade tricks. All he wants to do is to keep West out of the lead. If he plays the Queen and East eventually obtains the read  with the King of diamonds, the King in his own hand will be led through and captured. He should therefore play low from the Dummy|pc|s5st|

CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play double dummy, you see all four handsits great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to take it. Now, you may lead the next cardfrom the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. Now, please click |cp|1|AT|^*GR1, RETURN^*N |CP||AT|to return to your original location.|
