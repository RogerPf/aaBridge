^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|(hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily--activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Cafe), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This was actually an easy hand to bid and play. Kia has a clear opening bid, and Ally, especially because she is short in the majors, has a nice 3C bid. I would have opened my hand 2C. Basically, if Kia has the @HK or @CA I want to be in six. Normally it is not a good idea to bid Blackwood with a void. But I was willing to assume one of Kia's key cards was the @DA, and I just needed one additional key card from him. On some hands you have to "picture" partner's hand. This is one of them.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I only have 16 HCP, but opposite only 3 HCP (the heart King) I can make slam. The points don't matter on this hand. All that matters is if Kia has the cards I need, which are the club Ace and the heart King. That is one thing good players learn to do on distributional hands, where point count is very inaccurate. They picture what partner needs, and if the bidding says it is likely, they bid what they think they can make.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, lets talk about how the auction might go if I open 2C. On virtually all hands, responder bids 2D. The only exception is if responder has a 5+ card suit with 2 of the top 3 honors. Then he is allowed to bid the suit. So, theoretically, Kia can bid 3D over 2C. However, I don't like that bid because it takes up too much room. It is the same reason I am reluctant to open 2C when I have a good diamond suit. Because, the auction goes 2C-2D-3D, and we have preempted ourselves, at the 3D level with our first real bid. Let us see how would it have been if I was the dealer.|

nome: Do you use the Bergen's 4-4 rule for 2C opening?|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I do use the Bergen 4 and 4 rule in general. The Bergen 4 and 4 rule says you should open 2C if you have 4 or fewer losers and 4 or more quick tricks. Technically, on that hand, although I only have 2 losers (heart and club), I only have 3.5 quick tricks. However, I think even Marty Bergen would agree that is an exception and 2C is the correct bid on the hand. The other rule I use when I open 2C is if I can count 9 tricks in my hand, and since I can count 10 tricks at this least (7 hearts and 3S), that is another reason to open 2C.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, although they can make 3N, 4H, or 4S, double worked well. Now, let's discuss Kia's 3D bid. By the law of total tricks it is correct, since we have at least a 9 card fit. So, I can't fault him for it  except for one thing. I know he recently took Marty Bergen's lesson on the law of total tricks, and he forgot the "fine print." For those who did not take the lesson, 3D is a reasonable call. But Bergen also says, particularly at unfavorable vulnerability, it is reasonable to adjust down by 1 trick if you have flat distribution.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, I have just about the worst overcall I can have, in fact one can make the case I should not overcall vulnerable with my hand. So, 3D is a reasonable call and we are only down a little bit more than their game. Having said that, if Ally continues to play diamonds rather than spades then it goes for -800, and that is not a good result at all.|

LCCastro:  Do you think playing carefully, 6@H makes?|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not sure 6H makes but it has plays for sure. You probably only have a club loser if you take 2 club finesses. But I am not sure many pairs would get there. So, technically, even -800 beats the best score that E/W can make, since 6H is worth 980. However, from a practical perspective, I suspect in a duplicate game, -500 would be a good board, and -800 would be close to a top score.|

Once Ally bids 3H Andy can add 3 for singleton diamond and 4 trumps. So, 15, opposite Ally's promised 18 means slam is very possible--Ally has 20 Starting Points. |

^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|March 29, 2011 was not a good day for Kia. First, he had to go through the confusing steps of Puppet Stayman which he neither knows nor plays. Second, he blew a cold 3NT contract though at the beginning he fully knew how to successfully play it but changed his mind in the middle of the play. Finally, he had to bear more pain in recording the saga into a presentation for the entire world to view.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Puppet Stayman allows you to find out if Kia has either a 4 card major or a 5 card major. If Kia has a 5 card major, often the case in this auction, he would bid 3H or 3S. With a 4 card major he bids 3D, which says he has a 4 card major.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


mb|p|mb|3D|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Kia's correct bid is 3D as he has  a four card major. With no 4 or 5 card major, Kia bids 3N. All bids are game force and alertable.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


SB|S|SB|W|mb|p|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now Ally wants Kia to play the hand. In order for that to happen, if she has only one 4 card major, she bids the major she does not have. In this case her 3H bid shows spades. If she had 4 hearts and not 4 spades, she would bid 3S. That way Kia can bid his real suit and end up as declarer. Had Kia had spades, since Ally is showing spades he would bid 4S.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


mb|3H|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|By bidding 3H, Ally guarantees that Kia becomes declarer no matter what he has. And it is very advantageous for the strong hand to be declarer. So, on this hand, since Kia has hearts, not spades, and Ally is denying hearts Kia simply bids 3N. If Ally happens to have both 4 card majors, she bids 4D and Kia bids his 4 card major. So, if Ally happened to have both hearts and spades she would bid 4D over 3D and Kia would bid 4H. The whole point of puppet Stayman is a) to find out if opener has 5 card major, and b) to make sure opener gets to play the hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you find this confusing (and you should) I would not worry too much about learning Puppet Stayman. Ava and I do not play it, and we have never missed it. But I thought it would be interesting for the lesson. There are more important things to learn first.|

athni: Does Puppet Stayman applicable in 1NT bid Howard?|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most people do not play Puppet over 1N. The reason being, you cannot play Garbage Stayman then, because partner is allowed to bid 2N over 1N with no majors. So, although you theoretically could play Puppet, most people don't. A few people play 2C is normal Stayman, and 3C over 1N is Puppet Stayman. That is an interesting convention and I have no opinion as to whether or not it makes sense.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss how I would have played the hand. On the opening lead Kia can count 8 sure tricks (the club lead guarantees 2 tricks no matter who has the @CK). He simply needs one more trick. One obvious play is the spade finesse which happens to work. But he can give himself extra chances as well. He has great diamonds. If diamonds split 3-3 or someone has a singleton or doubleton honor, he will score 4 diamond tricks. The odds of that are pretty high, over 50%.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, he can combine his chances. First of all, play the @cQ. Once that wins, start diamonds. On this hand, my @DJ is singleton, so Kia has just set up 4 diamonds for 10 tricks. But after playing 3 rounds of diamonds, if someone started with QJxx, then he can fall back on the spade finesse. That increases his odds to well over 80%.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good thinking Andy :).  His low diamond is a suit preference, asking Kia to play back clubs. If he wanted Kia to play back spades he would have led a high diamond. Whenever you lead back a card for partner to ruff, it is a suit preference. Low spot means lower non-trump suit--in this hand clubs. Had Andy led back the @D10, he would be asking for spades.|

camilleln: Howard, I realized what a terrible bid that was--vul vs non vul. They don't have a fit and I have a balanced hand. Everything that is bad I had in this hand!|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me talk about Ally's bid. Normally, if they stop at the 2 level, AND, (this is important), you know they have a fit, you don't want to let them play it there. Here, they did stopped at the 2 level but they did not show an 8 card fit. In fact, on this auction, it is just about guaranteed they have a 7 card spade fit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Kia did not rebid spades, so he has 5. Andy did not raise spades immediately, so he has 2. So, in this case, the missing ingredient is that they do not have a fit, so letting them play at the 2 level is not necessarily a bad thing. If Ally were a bit more distributional, she might take a bid anyway, but with a flat 11 HCP, particularly with us being vulnerable, pass is best. As you know, I love to bid, but in this case even I would pass :).|

EddyHaskel: Howard, were you at all tempted to leave in the double, with your three spade honors and knowing this was probably a 20-20 kind of hand and you have a fit and they don't?|
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you saw Eddy we went down 2. It is unlikely we have a 9 card heart fit, and if we can make 3H with an 8 card fit, they are probably down in their 7 card spade fit. It is okay to bid 3 over 2 with an 8 card fit when you know they have an 8 card fit. But it is not okay to bid to the 3 level with an 8 card fit when they are not in their 8 card fit.|

@D@D nome: Now, if you wish, you can play this hand double dummy. Lead was the diamond 5, however, you can choose a different lead. Just click any card from that hand. When finished or if not interested in the double dummy feature please, click the forward arrow to move to the next section. |

^-{        Writing on the Sand - by nome         }
^-|HT|f|CP||FP|1|at|^B@2^Z@3B|FP||AT|ridge information stays with me as long as writing on the sand at the beach. It takes only one soft wave to wash everything away. However, as I get older I become more persistent and keep writing on the sand--reviewing the material over and over. This week I have a simple cheat sheet for responding to one of majors opening by an unpassed hand when the opponents are silent. It is based on 2/1 system. The value of the hands are based on Bergen Hand evaluation method. Howard has approved the answers, however, as always there may be other reasonable answers.|

Answer: You are correct. That bid is not reasonable. Always, support with support. Partner should have bid 2H even with five-card spade suit. You should immediately tell partner when you have a fit.|

You have 12 Dummy Points. Bid an economical and one round forcing 1@S. Were you playing SAYC you could bid an invitational 3H. In 2/1 a pre-emptive 3H bid promises 0-6 HCP and 4 (maybe 5) trump support. You have 12 dummy points and too strong to bid constructive 2H. Also, you cannot bid 1NT forcing as when you bid hearts  next time partner does not believe you have three-card support. You would bid 1NT forcing had you two-card support.|

The 2@S bid is a Weak Jump Shift (WJS) and promises six-card (occasionally seven) spade suit, less than 7 Starting Points (typically shows 2 or 3 HCP) and as few as two hearts and it is to play.|

2NT (Jacoby 2NT) is the correct bid. To bid it, you need 13+ Dummy Points, 4+ cards support and no singleton unless you have more than 17 Dummy Points. It is a Game Force.|

You are correct not liking such a space consuming bid. In 2/1 you do not have to rush. Better look for another partner if he/she does it again. However, there are some people who use that bid when they have a 1NT opener.|
