qx|1B01, THE POWER OF HONORS|
nt||HT|e|at|^b@2^z@3Before you can learn anything about the play of the hand at Contract Bridge, you must first understand that each card has a value and a meaning. Of course, you know that the Ace is the highest card in a suit, and that the King beats the Queen, and that a Queen is always better than a Jack, and so on. But it is entirely possible that you have never learned the full power of these cards, for they will do far more, if properly handled, than merely win a trick over any lower card.|PG||AT|

First of all, then, you must study the relationship of the various cards in the pack to each other; and you must particularly study the relationship of the honor cards (the five highest cards in each suit, namely, the Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and Ten). Do not be contemptuous of this seemingly elementary knowledge, for only if your basic knowledge is sound can your later refinements be worth striving for. |PG||cp|8|at|^-

The player who ^*Ithinks he knows^*n, because he has participated in a few hundred rubbers,
and who wants to plunge immediately into squeeze plays and coups,
will never be a good Contract player. 
^-|PG||cp||at|
His parboiled knowledge has not allowed for the general principles of play which must be the higher law of every hand. Someone who masters the general principles, but cannot for the life of him tell you what a Double Grand Coup is, will win more points than the specialist in the Grand Coup—for those miraculous plays come very seldom in a Bridge player's lifetime.|PG||NT||

nt||HT|e|at|^b@2^z@3The various "^*Ihonor-trick^*n" and "^*Iquick-trick^*n" valuations, as well as the different "point" counts used in valuing honors, are not arbitrarily determined by the experts who recommend them as a basis for bidding. Every such valuation is theoretically based upon the relationship of those honors and honor combinations in the play of the hand. The fact that an Ace is given the value of "1 honor-trick" means that the Ace is almost certain to win a trick in the play. The King is usually valued at "^*I1/2 trick^*n" because it will on the average, win a trick about half the time—that is, a guarded King, without the Ace, will win 1 trick about 50 times out of 100|va|2|fp|1|CP|8|AT|*|fp||CP||AT|, and be captured by the Ace or by ruffing the other 50 times out of 100.|fp|1|CP|8|AT|
*|fp||CP||AT| A strict mathematical average, of course, never develops in practice. The "1/2 trick" value and other similar|va|4|at| approximations, are generally too high for a poor player, and too low for an expert. —Sam Fry, Jr.|PG||AT|

It is thus clear that all bidding valuation, to be of any use, must be based on what is expected to happen in the play. If you understand the relationship of honors—and also of lower cards—in the play, your bidding should then become more imaginative and more accurate. In fact, the ultimate object of anyone undertaking to learn more about the play of the hand at Contract Bridge should be to improve upon the mathematical averages ascribed to honors and other cards for bidding purposes. |PG||cp|8|at|^-

Your object should be, not to take a trick with a guarded King half the time,
but ^*Isixty percent of the time!^*n

at|^-{    THE MEANING OF RANK    }
^-|cp||fp||at|^b@2^z@3Each card in the pack holds a special rank one position above the next highest card of the same suit. Thus, any Ace outranks the King of the same suit by one position, the Queen by two positions, the Ten by four positions, and so on. The King outranks the Queen of the same suit by one position, but the same King outranks the Jack of the same suit by two positions. It would therefore seem that the Ace should take the first trick in a suit, the King the second in that suit, and so on. Everyone knows that this is not necessarily true, for the first trick in a suit—the first ^*Iround^*n, as we say—may be won by a low card like the seven-spot. Why does the Ace not always win the first round? Simply, because there is no compulsion for a player to win a trick with his Ace (except when it is the only card he holds of the suit led)—he may find it better to keep his Ace until a later round, when it may actually be more valuable to him. |PG||AT|

The manner in which he decides to play his Ace (or King, or any other high card), sooner or later, is explained in this book. Just now the important thing to learn is that as each round of a suit is played, the rank of the ^*Iremaining cards^*n (those as yet unplayed) changes. It is obvious that if the Ace and King of a suit are played on the first round, the Queen thereupon becomes the highest card of the suit—the Queen is promoted to the position of first command, so to speak. The Queen now controls the next round of the suit; that is, the holder can win the next round with the Queen, if he so wishes. |PG||NT||

at|^-{    THE MEANING OF RANK - Continued    }
^-|cp||fp||at|^b@2^z@3The foregoing principles may be stated as a general truth: ^*IWhenever an honor is played to a trick, each lower card automatically goes up one position in rank^*n. This is illustrated by the following situation:|PG||NT||
ST||pn|You,,Partner,|MD|DJT2,DQ54,DK76,DA983|sv|o|rh||AH|Board A|HA|Y|wt|E|at|^b@2^z@3Suppose that yours is the South holding (@D J 10 2). Ordinarily you would not regard the Jack as being of much value.|PG||AT| But suppose that East (the Opponent on your right) leads a low card (the three-spot),|PC|d3|pg||at| and you play the Ten, East plays the Queen, and North, your Partner, plays the King.|PC|dtdqdk|PG||at| Your Jack now suddenly becomes of much greater value, for it has been promoted to second position in the suit—only the outstanding Ace can beat it. |PG||nt||at|^b@2^z@3In other words, you are now able to take the third round of the suit, when, before the first round had been played, you could not even expect to take the fourth round! |pg||at| Let us go back.|UP||UP||UP||UP||pg||AT| Suppose that East led his Ace at the first opportunity,|pc|dad2d4d6|pg||wt|n|AT| and your Partner led his King at the next opportunity,|PC|dkd3dtd5|pg||WT|W|AT| and the Queen was played from the West hand on the third round|PC|dqd7d8dj|pg||AT| —your three cards would have fallen on the three leads, without winning a single trick. It is apparent, then, that the manner in which the cards of a suit are played may greatly affect the rank of the cards in the suit.|PG||NT||bt||

fp|2|3d|3|
at|^-{    THE MEANING OF RANK - Continued   }
^-|cp||fp||at|^b@2^y@3The principle of this axiom could be carried on indefinitely. For instance, if three honors are played to a trick, the card next below the lowest of the three played honors gains three positions in rank. Thus, in the preceding example, the Ten, Queen, and King having been played to the first round, East's nine-spot is promoted three positions, from the sixth rank to the third. Before any rounds of the suit were played, the rank of the cards was A K Q J 10 9; after the first round, as given, the rank became A J 9 8 7 6. Though the nine-spot is not an honor, it can become the third highest card of a suit after the first round has been played. Therefore, when we speak of "honors" we are usually referring to the commanding cards of a suit, and we may at times find that nines or eights are even such.|PG||AT|	 

Now that you appreciate something about the rank and position of the cards in a suit, in relation to one another, you can realize the importance of promoting the rank of your lower cards as often as possible. ^*IWhenever you win or attempt to win a trick, you should try to gain as many positions of rank as possible for your lower cards in the suit^*n.|PG||AT|

There are two fairly obvious ways of carrying out this principle. One way is to lead high cards and pray that the intervening high cards held by the adversaries will drop (that is, that the holders will—have to play them because they hold no other cards of the suit). Another way is to force an Opponent to lead a high card which can be captured by your own higher card. Thus, if you win an Opponent's King with your Ace, you bring your Queen up one position in rank—in fact, you promote it to the highest ranking card of the suit. Even if you hold the Jack (and not the Queen), by winning the adverse King with your Ace you promote your Jack's rank two places, when the play of the Ace without winning an adverse honor will promote your Jack only one place. The second way—forcing an Opponent to lead—is therefore the better way to accomplish your purpose to promote the rank of your lower cards as fast as possible.|PG||NT||

nt||HT|E|cs|1|cp|4|
fp|2|3d|3|
at|^-{    THE MEANING OF RANK -Continued    }
^-|cp||fp||at|^b@2^y@3You must see that to lead an Ace is very like trying to stab an enemy in the dark—without even knowing where he stands! The chances are pretty good that you will miss your mark, and do no damage. For certainly if you lead an Ace your two Opponents are not going to drop an honor each just to oblige you. They will play the lowest cards they have, holding on to their King and Queen (against your original holding of Ace-Jack) which you have automatically promoted for them by your immediate lead of the Ace. |CP||pg||AT|

However, if you let one of the Opponents lead the suit in which you hold Ace-Jack, and if the second Opponent is also obliged to play ahead of you (that is, you play the last card to the trick), either the King or the Queen must be played by the Opponents or you will win the trick with your Jack. On the King or Queen you will then play your Ace, leaving only one card outstanding that is higher than your Jack, when there were two before.|PG||AT|

Therefore, ^*Iin trying to promote lower cards of a suit, remember that it is easier to capture adverse higher cards whenever you play after one or both Opponents^*n. The following situation illustrates this:|PG||NT||

at|^-{    THE DEVELOPING POWER OF HONORS     }
^-|cp||fp||at|^b@2^y@3We have already hinted that honors may not only promote lower honors to higher rank, but, when the honors have been played, still lower cards attain the rank of honors. You must get in the habit of thinking not only of the five or six highest cards, but try to picture each suit as containing thirteen cards. The very fact that the number of cards in each suit is uneven is significant, since an even number of cards (four) must be played on each round of the suit. Thus, if three rounds are played when every player follows suit, only twelve cards are played, leaving the thirteenth card still outstanding.|PG||AT| 

For example, suppose the heart suit is distributed in the four hands as follows:

^H@H543 |AT|

^E@H876 |AT|^K@HJ109 |AT|

^H@HAKQ2

The player in the South position is fortunate, indeed, in his heart holding. With such a holding, and the distribution 4-3-3-3 around the table, you may lay down the Ace, King, and Queen in succession, and your Opponents must follow suit, leaving you, after these three rounds have been played, with the deuce as the only unplayed heart. You may now lead the deuce and take a trick with it (assuming that there are no trumps to ruff it). What has actually happened is that the Ace, King, and Queen of hearts have ^*Ideveloped the deuce^*n and promoted it from the thirteenth ranking card—lowest in the suit—to the first ranking card for the fourth round!|PG||NT||

cp||fp||at|^b@2^z@3Consider now the following situation, which is less simple:

^H@H654 |AT|

^E@H987 |AT|^K@HQJ10 |AT|

^H@HAK32

Again the distribution among the four players is 4-3-3-3, and you, sitting South, have the four cards headed by Ace-King. You may lead the Ace followed by the King, and then lead your trey (three-spot) to the third round. East must, of course, win the third round, but thereupon your lowly deuce is again developed, and has become the highest card of the suit for the fourth round! The only difference between this example and the preceding one is that in this example you lose 1 trick in the process of developing the deuce into a trick winner. A card thus developed into a trick winner is also said to be ^*Iestablished^*n.|PG||AT|

The developing power of honors comes about, quite obviously, because the rules of the game require that a player "follow suit" by playing a card of the suit led whenever he has one. In fact, if a player does not follow suit when able to do so, he is guilty of a revoke, and may be severely penalized according to the laws of Contract Bridge. It should also be clear that this developing power of honors ceases to exist if the combined hands of yourself and Partner do not contain more cards of the suit than the Opponents hold in their combined hands. If you hold the controlling top honors, of course, your suit is already established. |PG||NT||

^H@DAKQ2

Your holding is the same as in the distribution of the heart suit previously discussed. You can lead the Ace, King, and Queen, but you will never develop your deuce into a trick winner. The reason is that your Opponents hold seven diamonds against your six. Since the most the Opponents can play on three rounds is six diamonds. Their seventh card of that suit is bound to become established.|PG||CP|8|AT|^-

In the process of developing lower cards into trick winners—that is to say, establishing lower cards—
the honor strength does not need to be all in one hand,
as in the examples thus far given.

^H@CK763 |AT|

^E@C1085  |AT|^K@CJ92 |AT|

^H@CAQ4

Here the thirteenth club can be established by the simple expedient of leading the Ace and Queen from the South hand, and going over to the North hand by leading the four-spot to the King. These three rounds draw the six clubs held adversely, leaving the three-spot established in the North hand.|PG||AT|

In all the preceding examples, the ratio of length held by each side has been seven cards of the suit held by one partnership and the other six cards of the suit held by the other partnership. It naturally follows that if the suit is divided eight cards on one side and five cards on the other, the possibilities of developing low cards into trick winners are increased, for the Opponents hold only five cards with which to oppose the establishment of the suit.|PG||FP|2|AT|

Generally speaking, when you hold only seven cards of a suit in your own and Dummy's hand, four in one and three in the other, you can only hope that the other six cards of the suit will be divided evenly between the Opponents. But if you hold five cards in one hand and three in the other (your own hand and Dummy's), you can confidently expect that the other five cards will be divided three and two. While it is not unusual for six outstanding cards to be divided four and two in the Opponents' hands, it is less common for five outstanding cards to be divided four and one. |PG||FP||CP||NT||

cp||fp||at|^b@2^z@3Carrying the principle further, you should be able to see at once that with nine cards in your own and Dummy's hands, and only four in the Opponents' hands, the chances of developing low cards are still greater. In fact, there is a point at which the honors cease to be necessary as developing cards.|PG||AT|

When the principle is carried to its ultimate conclusion, we find a situation like the following distribution of the spade suit:
^H@S9752 |AT|

^E@SAK |AT|^K@SQJ |AT|

^H@S108643
If you are South, as Declarer, your two hands lack the four top honors in spades, yet because you have nine spades against four held by the Opponents, you can develop spade tricks without the aid of spade honors. With the four outstanding honors divided two and two, as shown, you need only lead spades twice to establish 3 spade tricks—actually winning 1 spade trick more than the Opponents, who hold four honors between them! This distribution is not common, but it is a good illustration of the principle of developing low cards by eliminating the higher cards.|PG||FP|2|AT|
	
You have learned the power of honors in promoting lower cards to a higher rank in their suit. You have seen that sometimes even a card lower than an honor—even the deuce—may rise to the rank of an honor when all the higher cards have been "killed off." When a card reaches the top rank in the remaining cards of its suit, that card is said to command the suit. A good Bridge player often finds it desirable to keep control of a suit by retaining the commanding card in it, or by promoting a lower card to the position of the commanding card. This matter of control, indeed, is of vast importance in the play of the hand at Contract Bridge.|PG||FP||NT||

^-|cp||fp|2|at|^b@2^y@3To have control of a suit means to hold the highest unplayed card in that suit.|FP||AT| If you do not have the highest or commanding card, but if you do have the second or third highest, with some protection below it, you still have some measure of control—what may be called secondary control as distinguished from the primary control assured by holding the highest card. |PG||AT|

For example, if the highest outstanding spade is the Jack, and you hold the Ten and nine of spades, the Ten gives you secondary control of the spade suit (the holder of the Jack has primary control), because the nine protects the Ten. If you hold the Ten and eight, or the Ten and seven, the eight or the seven is merely indifferent protection, for if you have to play a spade before the holder of the Jack, your Ten may be forced since the eight or seven will not drive out the Jack if the nine-spot is with it. Any lower card than the seven held with the Ten against the Jack can only be regarded as doubtful protection.|PG||AT|

For the time being, you need consider only primary control of a suit. If you realize the value of this, you will have taken an important step toward mastery of the play of the hand. |FP|2|AT|Once primary control of a suit is relinquished, the Opponents will lose no time in proceeding to capture tricks with their lesser honors and lower cards.

Because of the fact that each card holds a rank one position above the next highest of the same suit, whenever an honor is played to a trick each lower card automatically  goes up one position in the rank—in relation to the cards of that suit which are as yet unplayed.
