qx|27B01,Trump Leads by the Defending Side|
NT||HT|e|at|^B@2^Y@3As you know, one of the most advantageous aspects of Declarer's play at a suit contract is that certain otherwise losing cards can be ruffed in the Dummy (sometimes). This circumstance frequently increases the value of a hand by 2 or more tricks, and makes it to that degree unnecessary to hold so many high cards as would be required to make the same number of tricks at no-trump. Short suits and voids in the Responding Hand (the prospective Dummy) are always regarded as valuable assets, especially when three or four cards of Partner's bid suit (the prospective trump suit) are held.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

The Defending Side, as you have already seen, busy themselves with trying to figure out how to best the Declarer. If the Declarer has certain assets, the Defending Side must try to depreciate those assets whenever possible. You have been told how the Defending Side try to establish high cards of their own before the Declarer can set up his for discarding purposes; how the Defending Side, on occasion, force the Declarer to ruff and thereby shorten his trump holding; and how the Defending Side may hold up in order to block the Dummy or take an entry out of the Dummy to embarrass the Declarer, and so on.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|		 

The next step to learn is how to prevent the Declarer from making full use of Dummy's ruffing-tricks. Certainly the first method that should occur to anyone would be to reduce the number of trumps in Dummy's hand. This can be done the most easily by leading trumps yourself. If you see that the Dummy contains a short suit, and at the same time you perceive that the Declarer seems somewhat reluctant to draw trumps, it is a practical certainty that he is attempting to establish a few ruffing-tricks. If the Dummy does not contain any great number of trumps, you have a chance to foil the Declarer by leading the trump suit yourself—before the Declarer is ready to have it led. Of course this principle does not apply if the trump lead sacrifices a sure trick.|

PG| ***** 7 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If it should be a singleton and you play low, he will win the trick. On the other hand, even if you play the Ace and drop the King, the Queen in Dummy will still permit a discard. If the Declarer holds two diamonds, the play of the Ace gives him 2 diamond tricks, while the play of a small card holds him to 1 diamond trick. All in all, the odds are in favor of passing Partner's Jack up to the Declarer.|

The Declarer will still have one trump left in Dummy for ruffing, but one is not enough! He will eventually be forced to lose another heart in addition to the diamond Ace, which will defeat him by 1 trick.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


sc|y|up|20|sk||NT|^B@2
You will notice that in this deal the time element is more prominent than usual. The entire play is a race between the Defending Side and the Declarer. The Declarer did not have quite enough time to establish Dummy's ruffing-tricks by leading hearts, and you did not have quite enough time to prevent the Declarer from establishing 1 ruffing-trick.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Your side could have eliminated all of Dummy's ruffing-tricks if your Partner had chosen a trump for his opening lead, but to do that he would have had to be a magician. This inspired opening would have permitted you to take all three trumps out of the Dummy before the Declarer could get around to ruff even a single heart. This is not a criticism of West's opening lead; the fact is mentioned here merely to emphasize the importance of the time element.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Another interesting point in this deal is the play to the first trick. If you had played the Ace of diamonds, and by some chance returned another diamond, the Declarer would have made his contract, for the Queen of diamonds would have been available for the discard of his fourth heart.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On the other hand, if you had played the Ace and immediately led a trump, the result would have been exactly the same as when you played low. You would have been able to take all three trumps out of the Dummy before the Declarer could ruff hearts. The Declarer would have lost the same tricks—three hearts and one diamond.|

Eventually he will have to finesse the diamond, and let you get in the lead with your King, after which you can simply lead another heart to Partner's Queen. It is true that overtaking at the first trick is not entirely necessary, and that, if you play a low heart, Partner will probably know enough to lead trumps himself. However, you should never leave to your Partner a decision which you can determine rightly for yourself.|

^-|
cp||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3S|FP||AT|ometimes Dummy's ruffing power may be attacked immediately through the opening lead. This brings into consideration the bidding which precedes the play. Information gained during the auction often enables the Defending Side and the Declarer both to place certain key cards in certain hands, and to give some notion of what the distribution of the four suits approximates.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


AT|

It is very difficult to lay down specific rules for the opening trump lead. However, it is usually indicated in one particular situation. Suppose that your right-hand Opponent, who eventually becomes the Declarer, has named two suits in his bidding. His Partner has denied one and indicated somewhat neutral support in the other.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


AT|

Let us further suppose that you hold a fairly strong tenace in the suit which has been denied but no strength of any importance in the other. It is apparent, then, that the success or failure of the final contract must depend almost entirely on whether the Declarer will be able to establish his side suit. Since you sit over him with a potential second- or third-round winner, you know that his only chance of doing this probably lies in ruffing his low cards in the Dummy. Under these circumstances, you must try immediately to diminish Dummy's ruffing power.  |

North's bidding has shown that he does not particularly fancy either suit, but, if he must choose, he prefers spades slightly. His rather weak one no-trump bid must have shown maximum honor strength, because of his willingness to bid two no-trump on the second round rather than sign off by bidding two spades.|

SK|W|NT|^B@2
You hold 3 almost certain heart tricks, provided this suit is led to you enough times and also provided that the Dummy does not stand over you with ruffing power in that suit. If you are to make these 3 heart tricks, you must start out with the intention of eliminating Dummy's trumps. Your proper opening lead is therefore a low spade.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Why should you lead a low spade? Why not the Ace? There are two reasons for coming out first with a low spade. The first is that by leading low you retain your Ace and consequently retain control of the trump suit. If you should change your mind later as to your best defense, you will still hold an absolutely certain entry. |
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The second reason is less abstruse. If the trump opening should prove to be the best defense, and your Partner's original spade holding should turn out to be a doubleton, the opening of the Ace followed by a low card would eliminate Partner's two trumps immediately. Therefore, if he should gain the lead in the early part of the hand he would not be able to continue the trump attack, and only two rounds would be taken instead of three. |
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT|^B@2
By leaving him with a small trump (which he quite possibly has), you give him the chance of continuing the attack with this card if he gets in the lead before you do, and then you can take your Ace and lead a third round of trumps (provided the trump continuation is indicated).|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The important thing, however, is not really the choice of the card in the suit, but the choice of the trump suit itself. The trump opening puts you a step ahead of the Declarer, a step which would be irretrievably lost if you choose any other suit. See what happens. |

But it would be too late. The Dummy would still have a trump, and the Declarer would simply play the heart Ace and a low one, ruffing the latter. Eventually he would have to lose another heart trick, but his total losers in this suit would be two instead of three. In other words, he would make his contract because of your failure to make the time element work to your advantage.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This example shows that a trump opening is usually indicated when the success of the Declarer's contract depends on the establishment of his side suit. Of course, you must have a few trumps in order to make the trump opening effective, although at times you may depend on your Partner's ability to gain the lead, and continue this defense for you. A moment's delay—that is, a delay of a round or two—may prove fatal.|

PG| ***** 64 ***** |


AT|

That the Declarer is counting on Dummy's ruffing power can be perceived either during the play, by the fact that Declarer postpones drawing trumps, or by the fact that he is shortening a suit in the Dummy.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


AT|

Sometimes it can be guessed from the bidding, when it seems certain that the success of the Declarer's contract depends on setting up a side suit and that to do so he may have to ruff losers. |

AT|

Thus the trump lead may be indicated as early as the opening lead, or it may be suggested as the best line of defense any time during the play. You must keep your eyes open and your wits about you—as soon as you see what the Declarer's game is, you should try to block it.  |

{ Deciding when to lead trumps on opening lead }
^-|CS|4|CP||AT|
The basic idea is that you should make a trump opening lead when you suspect that dummy has moderate support for partner (at most 3 cards) and that your side has tricks in declarer's side suit that will be ruffed out.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


AT|

This most often occurs when declarer has bid 2 suits and dummy has delayed raised one of the suits. One example auction is:|HT|m|at|
{|ia|,1cp1sp2cp2dp2sp4s|at|} |HT|t|AT|^b@2^Z@3In this auction, declarer has shown spades and diamonds and dummy has shown 3 spades. If you as opening leader have some diamond cards, a trump lead is likely to work out, because dummy rates to be short in diamonds (dummy has shows 5+ clubs and 3 spades, leaving him only 5 cards at most in the red suits).|

Contrast this with the following auction -|HT|l|AT|{|ia|1Cp1Dp1Hp1Sp2Sp4S|at|} |HT|k|AT|^m@2^Y@3In this case, declarer has shown spades and diamonds. So, you might think that, if you have good diamonds, a trump lead is correct. And, it still might be correct, but it is less likely. In this case, dummy has 4 spades (in fact dummy is likely to be 4-4-2-3), so it is less likely that you will be able to draw enough trumps to make a difference. |
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


AT| To take an extreme example, if the auction goes |HT|s|at|^B@2{|ia|1sp4sp|at|},|HT|W|AT|^B@2^Y@3 a trump lead is obviously not going to eliminate ruffs in dummy, so you should only lead a trump if you feel that leading any other suit is likely to give away a trick, and you want to make a passive lead that does not give anything away.|

{ When a trump lead may cost you a trick }
^-|CP||CS||AT|^b@2
It is not unusual that a trump lead will cost your side a possible trick, because it will give declarer a free finesse, or at least eliminate a guess. For example, if you lead a trump from 2 or 3 small on an auction where you are pretty sure declarer has exactly an 8 card fit, you will often eliminate the guess of the Q of trumps. So, even if you decide you might want to lead a trump, here are some holdings that are likely to give away tricks:|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


AT|

a) A singleton trump. It is almost never right to lead trumps if you have a singleton, as it more often than not gives away a trick|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


AT|

b) Jx, Qx, Jxx, Qxx. If partner has a trump honor, this lead almost always costs your side a trick. |
