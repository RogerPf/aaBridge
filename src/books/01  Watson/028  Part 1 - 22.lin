nt||HT|d|cp||fp|2|at|^B@2^Y@3A|FP||AT|s already stated, defensive play is the most difficult aspect of Contract Bridge. Its difficulty lies in the fact that it is well-nigh impossible to classify or codify the different situations. Every hand requires special treatment. A principle which applies to one hand may not apply at all to another.|PG||AT|

Doubtless you have been admonished to "|cp|8|at|lead through strength|cp||at|" in the Dummy, when the Dummy is on your left, and to "|cp|8|at|lead up to weakness|cp||at|" in the Dummy, when the Dummy is on your right. These principles are inherited from Whist, and they are quite sound, generally speaking. They are based on the fact, already demonstrated in this book, that it is more advantageous to play after an Opponent than to play before him, especially when tenace positions exist.|PG||AT|

Actually, leading through strength and leading up to weakness amount to the same thing. They are given different names because, in the first, the play is made by an Opponent sitting on the right of the Dummy, and, in the second, by an Opponent sitting on the left of the Dummy.|PG||AT|

In other words, when you lead "through strength," you are leading through the Dummy so that Partner can play ^*Iafter Dummy plays.^*N You hope that Partner holds strength in the suit and can make better use of it playing after the Dummy, which also shows strength in the suit. When you lead up to weakness, you are doing exactly the same thing, except that the Dummy is the weak hand in the suit and you are letting your Partner play ^*Iafter the strong hand,^*N which happens to be the Declarer (who is presumably the strong hand, relative to Partner and the Dummy, though Declarer's cards cannot be seen, of course).|PG||AT|

The following example bring out these points:|PG||NT||PF||BT||
%%%%%%%%%%%%%% page 
st||pn|Declarer,You,Dummy,Partner|md| ,s963ht74,saq42hkj3,|rh||sv|0|ah|A1|NT|^B@2
You are sitting West, with the Dummy (North) the only hand you can see besides your own. If Partner leads from either suits, he will forfeit a trick. If Partner is to obtain the maximum possible number of tricks, in both spades and hearts, he must be allowed to play ^*iafter the Dummy.^*n|PG||
st||pn|Declarer,You,Dummy,Partner|md|s875h652,s963ht74,saq42hkj3,skjthaq98|rh||ah|A1|NT||NT|^B@2
The lead must come, that is, either from your hand or from Declarer's hand—South. If you are in the lead, there is no occasion to wait for Declarer to open the suit—for to do so would be disastrous for him, as he very well realizes. If you wait, Partner may be forced to lead later on and thus contribute tricks to the Declarer's score. In order to get the full advantage of such a suit distribution as in the current situations, you should lead the suit promptly. The proper card is the highest—which is but an extension of the rule governing the proper card to choose when opening any suit.|PG||NT||bt||
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% page 
st||md|,S874,SKJt9|rh||ah|A2|NT|^B@2
A lead through strength should not be made when it appears that to do so may sacrifice a trick. Take, for example, the above situation. |PG||AT| If you lead the eight of spades, it is true that you are leading through strength. But this play can do no good unless Partner holds both the Ace and Queen. If he holds the Ace but not the Queen also, he will surely win a spade trick anyway. |PG||NT|^B@2
If he holds the Queen but not the Ace also, Declarer must hold the Ace, and your play through strength simply traps Partner's poor Queen. It is true that the Dummy offers a finessing situation which Declarer can take advantage of himself, if left to his own devices, so you may figure that to lead through it will sacrifice nothing anyway. |PG||NT|^B@2
But it is also true that the Declarer, if allowed to lead spades himself, may not execute the finesse correctly. After all, he does not know where the Queen is, and he may decide to finesse against its being in ^*iyour hand.^*n If he does this, Partner's Queen will win anyway. Again the percentage is against such a lead through strength, for it risks the loss of a trick which might otherwise be made, under favorable circumstances.|PG||NT||bt||
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% page
st||md|,hq74,hkjt9,|rh||ah|A3|NT|^B@2
To lead through strength in the current situation is even worse.|PG||AT| If you lead hearts at all you are committing suicide so far as this suit is concerned. You can gain nothing whatsoever, and you abandon your only chance for making 1 trick.|PG||NT|^B@2
The point to remember is that you should lead through strength only when you do not risk losing a possible trick. Leads through strength are perfectly safe when everything depends on what Partner holds. If he can beat the Dummy, well and good; if he cannot, you simply let the Declarer take a trick with a high card which he must make in any event.|PG||NT|^B@2
It is not necessary to analyze leads up to weakness in any detail, for they are but variations of leads through strength. The following simple illustrations will suffice: |PG||NT||
st||ha|Y|pn|Declarer,Partner, Dummy,You|md|,,D864,DQJ5|rh||ah|B1|NT|^B@2
Suppose you are sitting East, with the Dummy (North) on your right. If you choose to lead this particular suit, you do so in the hope that Partner will hold some high card or cards in it which will enable him to play more advantageously after the Declarer than before him.  Of course, this situation is the best.  You should lead the highest card.|PG||wt|e|pc|dq|PG||NT|^B@2
However, the next situation,|PG||
st||pn|Declarer,Partner,Dummy,You|md|,,D864,Djt3|rh||ah|B2|NT|^B@2
is less desirable and you should lead @DJ—the highest card.  |PG||wt|e|pc|dj|PG||NT|^B@2
And, the third situation,|PG||
st||pn|Declarer,Partner, Dummy,You|md|,,D864,D732|rh||ah|B3|NT|^B@2
 is the least desirable. However, they all offer a chance of rendering Partner's hand more effective by a lead up to Dummy's obvious weakness. In this instance, as the last two, you should lead your highest card.|PG||wt|E|pc|d7|PG||NT||wt||ha||bt||

^-{    APPLYING LEADS THROUGH STRENGTH AND UP TO WEAKNESS    }
^-|CS||CP||fp|2|AT|^B@2^Y@3T|FP||AT|he proper handling of leads through strength or up to weakness, as the case may be, is indicated by the following deal:|PG||nt||
ST||sk|w|pn|,You,,Partner|MD|1SQ96 H754 DAKQ CAJ92,SAKJ4HT93D864CT62 ,ST87 HKJ62 DJT5CKQ5,S532HAQ8D9732C874|rh||ah|B4|mb|1nppp|SV|o|pc|sK|NT|^B@2
Suppose you are sitting West and open the spade King against South's one no-trump contract. On your King, Partner plays the deuce, |PG||pc|s7s2s6|pg||at| which tells you immediately that he does not hold the Queen (his discard was discouraging). The Queen being there upon placed in Declarer's hand, it is apparent that you must try to get your Partner in the lead so that he can return a spade (leading through Declarer's strength and up to Dummy's weakness), thus enabling you to play after the Declarer.|PG||NT|^B@2
The only question you now have to consider is which suit to play next. By applying the principle of leading the suit which will give Partner's hand the best chance of winning, you choose a heart, and lay down your Ten. |PG||PC|HT|PG||AT| Dummy probably plays the Jack, and Partner's Queen holds the trick.|PC|hjhqh4|PG||NT|^B@2
Now Partner returns the five of spades, |PG||PC|s5|sk||at| and, if South plays the nine, you win with the Jack. If South plays the Queen, you win with the Ace. But in either case you are certain of winning 4 spade tricks. When you are through taking these spades, you lead the nine of hearts, and, regardless of what Dummy plays, Partner is assured of 2 more heart tricks. All together you take 7 tricks, defeating the Declarer's contract by 1 trick.|PG||NT|^B@2
The advisability of giving Partner a chance to play after the Dummy is very important in defensive play that takes place after the opening lead. Sometimes, however, the play is not made blindly—that is, not simply because it is generally good policy to do so—but it is made because it offers the best chance of setting the Declarer.

QX|22B03,SHIFTING To A SUIT OTHER THAN PARTNER'S LEAD|

^-{    SHIFTING TO A SUIT OTHER THAN PARTNER's LEAD    }
^-|
cp||fp|2|at|^B@2^Y@3T|FP||AT|hus far, the examples have shown that it is a good idea to return Partner's first suit rather than to shift to a suit of one's own. In general, this is the best line of defense, but occasionally some other procedure seems better. The shift to some other suit will be governed partly by the advisability of leading through strength or up to weakness, but this is by no means the whole story. The following deal brings out the vital point:|PG||NT||
st||sK|E|pn|,Partner,,You|md|1skjt6hk83dak8cqj4,sq973ha542d973c82,s854h76dqj64cakt5,sa2hqjt9dt52c9763|rh||AH|B5|NT|^B@2
You are sitting East, playing defensively against South's three no-trump contract.|rh||ah|B5|MB|3NTPPP|PC|S3|PG||at| When Partner opens the three of spades, you win with the Ace |PC|s4sas6|PG||at| and—though your first impulse is to return the suit—is this really the best line of defense?|PG||NT|^B@2
Stop and think a moment. By applying the Rule of Eleven, you discover that the Declarer holds as many spades as Partner. Of the three spades which Declarer must hold, two of them are almost certainly honors—as otherwise Partner would have led an honor from a sequence. This means that Declarer will obtain the lead almost immediately, and will probably be able to make his contract at once by means of his diamond and club tricks. |PG||NT|^B@2
Your ^*ionly chance of defeating the contract,^*n then, is to shift to some other suit. But what other suit? The only possible one is hearts, since diamonds and clubs are already pretty well controlled by Declarer, by the looks of the Dummy's hand. At the second trick, therefore, you lay down your heart Queen, |PG||pc|hq|SK||NT|^B@2
leading up to Dummy's weakness (and consequently through whatever strength the Declarer has), and, as it happens, no matter how Declarer plays, your side must win 4 heart tricks. |PG||NT|^B@2
The shift to hearts defeats the contract by 1 trick. The spade return would have presented the game to the Declarer, for he could take 10 tricks before your side regained the lead (the time element).|PG||NT|^B@2
This deal is an interesting illustration of shifting from Partner's opened suit, but it does not mean that you should always shift to another suit. You must carefully weigh the chances of establishing Partner's suit, as against the chances of establishing your own suit. Whichever course offers the brightest hope is the course to follow.|PG||NT|^B@2
When it is obvious that to establish your own suit will do no good, since your hand lacks entries and you ^*iknow^*n that you can never regain the lead, desperation tactics are necessary. The shift is clearly in order. You pray that you can strike gold by leading some other suit. Consider the following deal.|PG||NT||
st||sk|W|pn|,You,,Partner|md|1A43hA943dQ76cAJ9,sKQJt8hjt2d85c763,s962h65dAJt92cKQ4,s75hkq87dk43ct852|rh||AH|B6|NT|^B@2
Sitting in the West position, you open the spade King against South's three no-trump contract.|rh||ah|B6|MB|3nPPP|pg||PC|sk|pg||at| Declarer, applying the hold-up, refuses to win the trick, hoping to exhaust or strip the East hand of spades, so that he can never lead your suit back to you when he does get in the lead.|PC|s2s5s3|PG||sk|s|NT|^B@2
You continue with your spade Ten, and again the Declarer holds up his Ace.|PC|STs6s7s4|PG||AT| Declarer's play here is, as a matter of fact, poorly considered. He ought to know that if you held five spades originally, East can never return a third round. |PG||NT|^B@2
If you held but four originally, and East three, there is no danger in winning the second round either, because the Defending Side can then win but 3 spade tricks and 1 diamond trick at the most. We are supposing, for the sake of our illustration, that the present Declarer is not as good a player as he might be, and that he does hold up for two rounds of spades. You will run up against all kinds of players, so it is perfectly legitimate to assume now and then that your Opponent is not infallible.|PG||sk|w|NT|^B@2
Now it should be obvious that for your side to lead the third round of spades will do no good. You will establish two spades in your hand (West's hand), but you have no entries to regain the lead. You must therefore shift to another suit. What is more, this is no time to apply the principle of leading through strength, as Dummy's diamonds look far too potent to tamper with. |PG||NT|^B@2
Your only chance lies in hearts. You therefore lay down your Jack, |PC|Hjh5|PG||AT| on which Partner plays the eight|PC|H8|pg||at| (an encouraging discard),|Pg||SK||AT| and Declarer is hamstrung. No matter how long he holds up his heart Ace, Partner (East) must eventually get in the lead with his diamond King and take enough tricks to defeat the contract.|PG||NT|^B@2
Another occasion to shift to some other suit occurs when such a play will drive out a valuable entry from Dummy's hand, thus handicapping the Declarer. Of the three instances, probably the last is the most important. The following deal shows the third type of suit shift.|PG||NT||
st||SK|E|PN|,Partner,,You|MD|SAK2hQ43dAKt2c952,sQJt95hK986dqJ3c8,s83hA72d94cKJt76,s764hjJt5d8765cAQ4|rh||AH|B7|NT|^B@2
Sitting East, you are defending against South's three no-trump contract. |rh||ah|B7|MB|3NPPP|AT| Partner opens the spade Queen,|PC|SQ|at|  which Declarer wins with the King|PG||PC|S3s4sK|at|  (you play your four-spot). |PG||AT| Declarer now leads a club |PC|C2|at| and finesses Dummy's Ten.|PG||PC|c8ct|Pg||cp||AT| The finesse fails, for you win with the Queen.|PC|CQ|PG||cp||NT|^B@2
How do you size up the situation? If you return Partner's spades, the Declarer will probably be able to hold up and strip your hand of the suit. He will then certainly drive out your club Ace and you will not be able to put Partner in the lead. Whatever you play, at this point, Declarer will be able to enter the Dummy by means of the heart Ace and cash in his remaining clubs!|SK||PG||NT|^B@2
The heart Ace looms up as a vastly important card. Perhaps if you can drive it out of the Dummy immediately, Declarer will find the lack of it a sore trial. You therefore shift to hearts, laying down your Jack at the third trick.|PG||PC|HJ|PG||at| Whether or not Declarer plays the Queen, and whether or not he plays the Ace out of the Dummy, the entry will eventually be gone, for your Partner will cover the Queen.|PG||NT|^B@2
When Declarer tries to establish his clubs then, you simply hold up your Ace until the Declarer's own hand is stripped of the suit. He will then have to let you take whatever losing tricks he has left in his hand, for he can throw off none of them on Dummy's good clubs. A spade return, you see, would have allowed him to make his contract with ease.|PG||NT|^B@2
The importance of driving out a vital entry from the Dummy is seen to be very well worth considering. Sometimes the principle develops into what is known as the ^*IDeschapelles Coup^*N, which is described in a later Chapter on advanced play.|pg||nt||bt||

CS||CP||FP|2|AT|^B@2^Y@3G|FP||AT|enerally speaking, when sitting on the right of the Dummy, you should lead a suit through Dummy's strength. Do not do so, however, if the play may sacrifice a trick. Leads up to weakness, when you sit on the left of the Dummy, are really leads made through presumed strength in the Declarer's hand, so that Partner can play after the strong holding. These leads during defensive play after the opening lead may have particular application when they offer the best chance of defeating the Declarer's contract, by shifting to some suit other than Partner's first lead, as indicated by the following general rules:^*I

Shift to another suit—^*N

When it seems to afford a better chance of establishing tricks than does Partner's suit.

When you hold no entries after your own suit will become established.

When you can drive out what looks like a vital entry in Dummy's hand.  |PG||ht|x|
