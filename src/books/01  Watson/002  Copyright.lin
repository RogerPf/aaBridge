My searches found no patents or design registrations for the lin file format.  So  ^*baaBridge^*n  joins the other players and lin file converters available to the wider bridge playing audience.  This is of course the way things should be.

Imagine how restricted our choices would become if Microsoft(R) claimed that no other software was allowed to read  doc  files  or  Adobe(R)  tired to claim only they were allowed to read and write  pdf's.  Of course, all of us in the wider bridge playing community own a huge debt of gratitude to the original designers and developers of the lin file format  @-  Thank you.

As I said earlier, the text of Watson's book has been taken directly from the ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge^*nhondobridge^*x website.   If you click on and read  ^*h http://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=watsonkia^*n How it Came to be^*w  (link goes to the HondoBridge Website) the transcriptors and testers have obtained a, right to copy.  Again a bundle of thanks is due to them for putting the work of their transcription, from ^*b book to lin^*n,  into the public domain.  This must have been a HUGE job and is what inspired me to write this lin file player.

^*bP.S.^*n  In the UK (where I live and work) the Watson book is out of Copyright.  Year of Author's death (1936) + 70 years.  These days if you live in the US you need a lawyer to even guess when the copyright expires.  So if you are in the US and think you should not be reading the Watson book in this player, that's fine.  All you need to do is to click to the  ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge^*nhondobridge^*x  website and read it there in Hondo's great on-line player.


^*b Just to make it Clear ^*n

This ^*baaBridge^*n application is independent of HondoBridge and neither I nor it, is in any way affiliated to that website.  I am just a fan and think that all the great  Bridge Movies  available there deserve a wider audience @- which is, once again, the core reason why I wrote aaBridge.
