qx|26B01,FORCING THE DECLARER TO RUFF|
nt||HT|E|at|^B@2^Y@3I|FP||AT|n no-trump defense, it was pointed out that it is usually very inadvisable to lead from tenace combinations, the reason being that such holdings are sure to prove more valuable when they are led up to than when they are led away from. This same principle applies to suit defense, with the one qualification that the necessity for attacking a suit headed by a tenace occurs slightly more often than in no-trump, because of the time element. Less time is available for developing a suit against a trumping Declarer.|PG||AT|

As a general rule, it may be said that it is good practice to throw the lead into the Declarer's hand whenever it is possible to do so. The best way of accomplishing this is to lead some suit of which the Declarer's own hand is void. He will thus be compelled to exert his ruffing control by playing a trump, which reduces the number of trumps he holds and weakens his control to that extent.|PG||AT|

The fact that this sort of play has a negative aspect does not detract from its intrinsic value. It certainly loses nothing, and it very often gains something. It is of the greatest possible value when your own or Partner's hand (Defending Side) happens to hold a few trumps. If the Declarer is forced to ruff often enough, the time may come when one of the defending players will hold more trumps than he. When this happens, the Declarer has lost control of the hand and can no longer guide its destinies. Because to lead a suit of which the Declarer has no more cards induces the Declarer to use one of his trumps for winning the trick, this play is called the ^*Iforce^*N or ^-

"|FP|2|cp|8|at|forcing the Declarer|cp||FP||at|."
^-|PG||AT|^B@2^Y@3
The deals which follow illustrate how the force is used to gain tricks for the Defending Side. But the reader must bear in mind that these examples have been carefully chosen. In the great majority of hands in actual play the force will not succeed in accomplishing much. Sometimes it succeeds only in "passing the buck" to the Declarer, by obliging him to make the necessary guesses about the future course of the play. But, as stated before, the force loses nothing, and is a good defensive maneuver to annoy the Declarer with, even if it gains but little on some particular deal.|PG||NT||

In this deal the force succeeds in defeating an apparently easy contract of four hearts (played by South). Holding the West hand, you should be immediately aware of the fact that you hold great defensive strength against four hearts.|PG||AT| You have four trumps, which will certainly cause the Declarer some anxiety, and you also hold a long suit of your own that is practically established. |PG||NT|^B@2
With this type of defensive holding, it is always a good policy to lead out your strong suit. Even if the Declarer ruffs the first or second round, his trump holding is reduced and your own trump holding becomes more threatening.|PG||NT|^B@2
To digress for a minute, a long and strong suit in a hand that also contains some length in the trump suit is a very powerful defensive weapon. Whenever you hold length in trumps—four or more—it is always best to open your longest suit, even if that suit is far from being solid. If you happen to catch your Partner with strength in the same suit, forcing the Declarer commences immediately and the value of your trump length mounts at once.|PG||NT|^B@2
In this deal, you select the club King for your opening lead.|PG||pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||at|^*B This card holds the trick, and you continue with the Queen. Declarer ruffs, and studies the situation.^*B|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|h5|pg||sk|S|pg||cp||at| He sees at once that if the hearts are divided 3-2, his contract is safe. He can then take three rounds of trumps and try the diamond finesse. If the finesse fails, he will lose altogether only 1 diamond trick, 1 spade trick, and 1 club trick, as he will have one trump left with which to stop the run of the club suit.|cp||PG||
NT|^B@2
He therefore leads a low heart over to Dummy's King and returns a heart to the Ace in his hand. |

pc|h2|pg||AT| At this point, Partner fails to follow suit.|
pc|s9|pc|hJ|pc|h7|PG||
SB|SSo the trumps are not 3-2 :(.|pg||sk||at|^*B The Declarer sees that the hearts were not divided 3-2, as he had hoped, and cannot afford to draw your remaining trumps. If he does draw the rest of the trumps, he will have none left himself, and will thus give up all protection against the club suit in the event that the diamond finesse does not go through as planned.^*N|PG||SB|S|NT|^B@2
He is therefore obliged to lead the diamond Queen first and play low from Dummy.|PG||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||at|^*B Partner wins with the King, and the business of forcing the Declarer shows an advantage. The situation is as you see shown above.^*N|sk||PG||cp||at| If Partner should forget about the forcing play, and should blindly lead the spade Queen with the vague hope of developing a trick in that suit, Declarer will make his contract by winning the trick, drawing the last two trumps, and giving up a spade trick at the end. |cp||PG||NT|^B@2
However, Partner does not do this for the simple reason that the manner in which the Declarer has played the trump suit shows that you (West) hold enough trumps to be embarrassing. East leads a third round of clubs, forcing the Declarer to ruff, and reducing his trumps to one less than you have.|PG||NT|^B@2
From this point the Declarer is set. His best play is to lead diamonds until you ruff. You then lead a fourth round of clubs and he will probably discard a spade. He then claims the balance of the tricks, but is defeated 1 trick.|PG||pc|cT|pc|hQ|pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||

An interesting point appears in connection with the above deal. You will notice that the Dummy contained four clubs, so that it was never able to trump the suit. Had the Dummy ever become short in clubs, the suit should have been abandoned. The reason for always forcing the long trump hand is obvious. The Declarer's long trumps are usually going to be winners eventually.|PG||NT|^B@2
If you force him to take these tricks immediately, you are hurrying his game and yet not giving up to him any tricks which he could not surely take later. If, on the contrary, you force the short trump hand to ruff, you obviously assist the Declarer in his development of ruffing-tricks. You know that part of Declarer's play consists of trying to win tricks with Dummy's otherwise worthless trumps.|PG||NT|^B@2
If, therefore, you lead a suit which Dummy can ruff, you simply aid the Declarer in his campaign. Indeed, this may cost your side a trick the Declarer could not otherwise make, for, if you should lead a suit which may be ruffed in either Dummy's or Declarer's hand, you are making the Declarer a free gift! With no cards of that suit in either hand, he cannot lead it himself; when you lead it, he can ruff in whichever hand he chooses and discard a loser from the other.|PG||NT|^B@2
The following situation proves the last statement:|PG||NT||sc||

Hearts are trumps, and you are sitting West. It is your lead.|PG||AT| If you lead the diamond Ace at this point,|PC|DA|PG||at| the Declarer can trump with the five of hearts in Dummy and|PC|H5d5|PG||AT| discard either a spade or a club from his own hand,|PG||AT|^*B or^*N|PG||UP|2|PG||AT| he can discard either a spade or a club from Dummy|PC|S4D5|PG||at| and trump with the seven of hearts in his own hand.|PC|H7|PG||AT| Which ever he does, he cannot lose more than 1 trick from this point on.|pg||up|4|NT|^B@2
If you lead a spade, however, or a club,|PC|SK|PG||AT| no method of play yet discovered can prevent the Declarer from losing 2 more tricks.|PG||NT|^B@2
You must therefore come to the conclusion that the lead of a suit which can be ruffed in either opposing hand is bound to give up a trick to the Declarer unnecessarily (except, of course, when you have no other suit to lead, when you are forced to give up the trick).|PG||NT||

Do not get the erroneous impression that it is always a good idea to force the Declarer. Forcing tactics will prove worth while as long as there is no danger that the Declarer will be able to take advantage of being in the lead by leading out an established suit for discarding purposes. You must be on the lookout for such a possibility, and if you see any danger signs you must abandon the forcing since it will put Declarer into the lead. Your better course is then to take whatever tricks seem winnable immediately.|PG||NT||

^-{    SPOTTING A DANGER SIGNAL    }
^-|
CS||CP||fp||AT|^B@2^Y@3T|FP||AT|he most usual danger signal is the presence of some long, almost solid suit in the Dummy. When you see a suit of this kind you must realize at once that you will not have time to reduce the Declarer's trump holding to your own level. The chances are that a force will simply give the Declarer more time to establish his suit and discard his losers. Consequently you must attack without hesitation and hope for the best.|PG||AT|

Therefore, you may as well lead the spade Ace,|pc|sA|PG||AT| for if Partner holds three spades, the Declarer's Queen must fall.|pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|sQ|PG||AT| This happens, and at the third trick you are confronted with a chance to force the Declarer to ruff a third round of spades. Certainly such a play will not directly forfeit a trick, but at the same time you should be restrained from making it by the presence of the five-card diamond suit in the Dummy.|PG||NT|^B@2
It should be apparent that if the Declarer has a solid heart suit plus the diamond Ace, he can run off enough tricks for his game contract before you can intercede. If Partner holds the diamond Ace, he will be sure to take it at a later time, and the fact that the suit is not led immediately will make no difference. The only suit left is clubs—and you must lead a club at the third trick.|PG||SK||NT|^B@2
You select the Ten—top of your tripleton—and, regardless of what Dummy plays, Partner must make both his Ace and Queen. If you had gone on with a third round of spades, the Declarer would have ruffed, it is true, but he would then have drawn the remaining trumps, taken his five diamonds, and scored his 10 tricks for game.

^-{    NOT FORCING WHEN IT MAY ESTABLISH A TRICK IN DUMMY    }
^-|
cp||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3A|FP||AT|nother reason for refraining from forcing the Declarer is to avoid setting up a winner in the Dummy. This happens when the card you lead to force the Declarer is a high card which, when it falls, will promote a high card in the Dummy.|PG||AT|

As a matter of sober fact, it is usually bad policy to lead the highest outstanding card in a suit when the Dummy holds the next highest, whether or not it is likely that Declarer will ruff. Such a play merely takes a trick at once which would probably be won later on anyway, and may result in giving the Declarer the one discard he is looking for. In such cases, it is usually advisable to shift to some other suit, applying the principles of choice laid down in the Chapter on Continuation Plays. The following deal is an illustration:|PG||NT||
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Board 4
pn||st||SK|W|md|1SAK876HAK54DA72CT,SQ43H72DT98CAK982,SJT52H86DQ54CQ643,S9HQJT93DKJ63CJ75|RH||AH|Board 4|mb|4Sppp|NT|^B@2
You open your club King against South's contract of four spades, and Partner plays the five while Declarer drops the Ten.|pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cT|PG||NT|^B@2
You thus gain a fair amount of information about the distribution of the suit. Partner is certainly not starting an echo, and therefore he did not hold a doubleton originally. He may have held a singleton, or he may have held three cards. If he held the singleton, you can lead out your Ace and allow Partner to ruff the third round.|PG||NT|^B@2
If Partner held the tripleton, however, your club Ace will allow the Declarer to ruff and will leave the Queen in the Dummy available for a subsequent discard.|PG||NT|^B@2
Clearly the club Ace is a dangerous lead and should be abandoned. The situation is not so desperate that such a risk is justified, as you must certainly make that Ace later if the Declarer should happen to hold three cards. Meanwhile, other lines of defense are open to you.|PG||NT|^B@2
In deciding which suit to shift to, you come naturally and logically to diamonds. You hold a three-card sequence, such as it is, and Dummy holds an honor. That means that you will be leading through strength. If Partner should hold a tenace over the Dummy (which is quite possible), you may still defeat the contract by making the shift to diamonds. At the second trick, therefore, you abandon the club suit and lay down the diamond Ten.|PG||pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||NT|^B@2
Declarer allows this card to come around to his Ace, and Partner drops the six—an encouraging card. Declarer thereupon leads out the Ace and King of spades, hoping that the suit will break 2-2. Of course, it does not break for him the way the cards lie, and you are left holding the good spade Queen. Declarer then leads the Ace and King of hearts, followed by a third round which he ruffs in the Dummy.|PG||pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|h3|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h5|PG||NT|^B@2
At this point, you must not make the major error of using your good trump to ruff the third round of hearts. If you do, the Declarer will simply discard a diamond from the Dummy, leaving him with but one loser in that suit.|PG||pc|c2|pc|sT|pc|hJ|pg||NT|^B@2
After ruffing the heart, the Declarer returns to his own hand by trumping a club and then ruffs his last heart with Dummy's last trump.|PG||pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|s6|pc|c8|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d8|pc|sJ|pc|hQ|pg||SK||at|
Another club ruff puts him back in his own hand, and he is compelled to lead diamonds. Your Partner's King and Jack both take tricks, and the last trick is won with your good Queen of spades. The Declarer is defeated 1 trick. It is perfectly obvious that a club continuation would have allowed him to make his contract very easily.|PG||pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|s7|pc|c9|pg||

The situation is not always as clear as it was in the preceding deal. Sometimes it is doubtful whether a continuation of the opened suit is not better than any shift will prove to be. In fact, sometimes you must go on with your original suit only to find that your sizing up of the situation was incorrect. Even in such instances, however, there are usually some means of repairing the damage which has been done. Take, for example, the deal shown here.|pc|cK|pg||NT|^B@2
South has reached a contract of four spades by somewhat ambitious bidding. Yet he has one chance of making it. You, sitting West, open your club King, and Partner starts an echo (to show ruffing potentiality) by playing the nine. Declarer plays the five.|pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|c5|PG||NT|^B@2
You are put at once into a quandary. Partner's nine shows either a doubleton or a singleton, which means that the Declarer must have held originally at least two clubs. Your club Ace will be certain to win the second round, then. However, if you lead it now and the ultimate distribution proves to be 2-2, the Dummy's Queen of clubs will be set up for discarding purposes. Therefore you should not continue with the club Ace unless you know the means you can take to prevent the use of Dummy's Queen as a third-round winner. If you see a later defense, you can play the Ace without any qualms.|PG||pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||sk||PG||NT|^B@2
Unfortunately, Partner and Declarer each had a doubleton originally. You must set about eliminating that club Queen in the Dummy. You know that Partner can ruff, but you also know that the Declarer can over-ruff. Does this do any harm? No, for whatever trumps your Partner holds must be negligible. Forcing Partner to ruff and Declarer to over-ruff will eliminate the Queen for discarding purposes. |PG||NT|^B@2
Nothing will have been lost, but the prevention of a discard from Declarer's hand will have been gained. You lead your third round of clubs, Partner ruffs with the eight of spades, and Declarer over ruffs with the nine.|PG||pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|s8|pc|s9|pg||mc|9|pg||at|^*B The remaining play is unimportant; the Declarer must still lose 1 spade and 1 heart trick. He could have discarded that losing heart on Dummy's club Queen if you had not led the third round.^*N|PG||NT|^B@2
It is perfectly true that if you had shifted to the Queen of hearts at the second trick, Declarer's contract would still have been defeated. However, to make this play would give you no opportunity to find out whether Partner held a singleton club originally. By knowing that you could immediately kill the card set up in the Dummy, you were able to take advantage of all your defensive possibilities. A play of this kind is really a variation of the force.|PG||AT|

^-{    FORCING THE DUMMY    }
^-|
CS||CP||fp||AT|^B@2^Y@3I|FP||AT|n the early part of this Chapter we stated that all forcing should operate on the strong trump hand. Like all Bridge rules, there is an exception to this principle. It is occasionally necessary to force Dummy to ruff, in order to eliminate an entry card. A situation of this kind can usually be recognized by the presence in Dummy of a long suit which threatens to become established. For example, take the following deal:|PG||NT||

Since you hold three diamonds yourself the suit will probably break and Dummy's Queen of hearts will serve as an entry. If possible, this plan of Declarer's must be circumvented.^*N|PG||NT|^B@2
At the third trick, therefore, you should lead another spade. (You know from partner's original lead of the deuce that Declarer holds one more spade).|PG||

The Dummy is forced to ruff, and after this the diamond establishment does the Declarer no good. If he leads three rounds of diamonds, trumping the third round in his own hand, and then plays the Ace and another heart over to the Queen, you can ruff the next diamond lead and force him to eventually lose 2 club tricks.|PG||NT|^B@2

CS||CP||fp||AT|^B@2^Y@3A|FP||AT|nother variation of the force on Declarer occurs when the Defending Side is faced with the problem of preventing a Declarer from obtaining discards in Dummy. |cp|8|at|As a general rule, it is safe to say that a player should always ruff, even though he knows that he is going to be over-ruffed|cp||at|. The trump sacrificed can be of little use and if the Declarer over-ruffs he is forced to retain whatever loser he is trying to get rid of. The following hand illustrates this principle:|PG||NT||

You are sitting East and South is the Declarer at a contract of four spades.|PG||pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hA|at|^*B West opens the King of hearts and Declarer wins with the Ace.^*N|PG||cp||at| He can not afford to draw trumps immediately as then he will automatically lose 4 tricks. So he therefore leads three rounds of clubs in the hope of getting rid of one of his heart losers.|PG||cp||pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||

On the third round of clubs you must ruff with the seven of spades and, from this point on, Declarer is helpless. He can either over-ruff or take his discard as he chooses, but nothing can prevent him from losing a total of 4 tricks.|PG||mc|9|pg||NT|^B@2
Note that it makes a great deal of difference whether you ruff with the Ace or with the seven. If you ruff with the Ace, Declarer will simply discard his heart and will succeed in getting rid of two losers on 1 trick. If your holding were Ten-seven or Jack-seven, or even Queen-seven, however, you should prefer to ruff with the higher card, as this may develop a trick in partner's hand (|fp|2|cp|8|at|*|FP||CP||AT|).|PG||cp|8|at|

*|CP||at|^*I Umpteen years later this specific type of play was christened "the uppercut" by various and sundry experts.—S. Fry. Jr.^*N|PG||NT|^B@2
This is true even if you hold three cards headed by the Ten or Jack. With three cards headed by the Queen the situation is a little closer, as you may conceivably be giving up a trick by ruffing high. Your choice depends on your chance of obtaining a trick with that Queen later. |PG||NT|^B@2
However, do not make the mistake of thinking that you should preserve the Queen and the small cards too, for it is almost always better to use one of your trumps. Even if you sacrifice a possible trump trick, you are at least preventing the Declarer from obtaining a much-needed discard.|PG||HT|v|AT|@D@D Please click the forward arrow to play this hand double dummy.|PG||PF|y|NT||

CS||CP||fp||AT|^B@2^Y@3L|FP||AT|eading a suit of which the Declarer (but not the Dummy) is exhausted, and forcing the Declarer to ruff, is often an advantageous play, for it shortens the Declarer's trump holding often to the point of embarrassment. The force is particularly valuable when you have three or more trumps and a long, strong side suit.|PG||AT|-

The Declarer should not be forced when the Dummy has a long, almost solid suit, or when the force may set up a trick in the Dummy (unless the trick in Dummy can be eliminated later by some means which offers itself before the force is attempted). |PG||ht|w|AT| This the end of Chapter XXVI.|pg||LF|CH-27-P-1.LIN|
