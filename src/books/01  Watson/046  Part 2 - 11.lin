cp||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3A|FP||AT| plan is necessary in all enterprises, and the play of a hand at Contract Bridge, whether in attack or in defense, is no exception. To form a plan, it is not necessary for you to keep in mind every bit of strategy you have learned in this book. That would be manifestly impossible. However, you should try to learn to recognize the different types of hands so that you can apply the proper principles at the proper times.|

With practice the process will not take as long as you think. After the first trick, you will already have some plan in mind and you can proceed along definite lines until developments prove to you the necessity for changing your tactics.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


AT| You may frequently find that you will be forced to abandon your original plan, but this should not be any cause for worry. Meanwhile, you might see opportunities for making use of all the fundamental and advanced plays you have learned in this book, such as hold-ups, unblocking plays, ducking plays, finesses, safety plays, end plays, squeeze plays, etc. Furthermore, be sure to start counting.|

You are now ready to play to the first trick. Your plan must also include many of the principles which you have learned from a study of no-trump tactics. Also, as in no-trump hands, your plan may change as necessity demands. By all means, remember to count.|

^-|
CS||CP||FP||AT|^B@2^Y@3A|FP||AT|n explanation of the thought processes of the defense is very difficult to chart. The chief thing that the Defending Side must bear in mind is that it is important to try to find out what plan the Declarer is making. After this is discovered, some means should be found, if possible, to circumvent it. In the beginning this is fairly impossible. The thoughts of the Defending Side might be divided up something like this:|

Beyond this it is impossible to go. As each trick is played, new influences come into play and each influence should start a new train of thought. Remember that it is just as important for the defense to count as it is for the Declarer.
