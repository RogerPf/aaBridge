You have run through this presentation and possibly also gone through some other presentations from around the web and now you want to make a lin file of your own to play in this (or any other) lin file player.

If so, there is a comprehensive tutorial and  How To's  contained in  THIS PACKAGE.   To make them visible @ -

In the right hand panel (you may need to move the side divider to the left) 

^c@.   ^*bClick on^*n     Start Up      (the tab at the top of right hand column)

Near the bottom off the panel is a Check Box  labled        ^*bShow multiple books in book menu^*n

^c@.   ^*bCheck that Box^*n

^c@.   close   ^*baaBridge^*n      and then restart it as you normally do.

	
In the books menu you will now see three additional books  (also available under Help).
	
This should be all you need to make your own  lin files  and even your own aaBridge.jar all without any programming.
	
	
Now,  at last,  the next   Step   will take you into
	
^h^*b Louis H. Watson's    The Play of the Hand at Bridge ^*n
