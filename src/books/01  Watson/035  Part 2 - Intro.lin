     Watson's classic book on the play of the hand at bridge enlarged and modernized by Sam Fry, Jr.     
Part - II, Advanced and Expert Technique
Introduction to Part II by Louis H. Watson

^B@2^Y@3^*BT^*Nhe Bridge player who has learned his fundamentals in the hard school of experience may, perhaps, dispense with a thorough-going study of the first part of this book, and make his beginning at this point—where explanation of advanced play and expert technique is comprehensively given. It is suggested to every reader, however, no matter how much experience he has had or how many books on the subject he has read, that he give Part I at least a brief survey before reading any portion of Part II. This is meant to be helpful, and not peremptory. 

The diligent reader who has already made a careful perusal of Part I, and who is sure that he has its material well in hand, may proceed with the ensuing chapters with full confidence and anticipation.|HT|r|at|^T@2Louis H. Watson |
