NT||HT|d|at|^B@2^Y@3T|FP||AT|he main object of every Declarer is to fulfill his contract in the easiest and quickest way he can. Extra tricks can only be incidental; if he hopes by some spectacular elimination or squeeze play to eke out a trick above his contract, and at the same time overlooks a chance to make his contract as solid as Gibraltar, he may make the kibitzers crane their necks, but he runs serious danger of losing out on the score sheet—in the long run.|PG||AT|

A ^*Isafety^*N play is exactly what its name implies: it is a play made to reduce to a minimum the risk of losing the contract. It is analogous to looking both ways before you cross a busy street, or to carrying a loaded rifle with the muzzle toward the ground, or to taking along an umbrella when there is a pretty good chance that it may rain. The nature of the safety play may clearly be seen when the two principal kinds are defined. |PG||AT|

One kind of safety play deliberately sacrifices a trick in order to run as little risk as possible of ^*Ilosing 2 tricks^*N. This play is made, of course, when the contract is still safe if the sacrificed trick is given up. |PG||AT|

The other kind of safety play consists of handling honor combinations in such a way that the worst possible adverse distribution can be taken care of without losing the contract.|PG||AT|

The execution of a safety play is not difficult. It does not require any special knowledge of card distribution, nor does it necessitate the ability to recognize certain specific situations (an ability required, for instance, to execute a squeeze play).|PG||AT| You simply grasp the idea that a safety play is not card sense, but ^*Icard common sense^*N, and never forget to count the number of winning or losing tricks that a hand contains|PG||AT|

In fact, certain elementary plays are really safety plays strictly considered. The hold-up is a safety play, as also is the refusal to draw trumps when it is not necessary to do so. The safety plays explained in the ensuing pages, however, are a degree more complex. But as you proceed from one example to another, you will see that it is always easy to recognize the place for a safety play ^*Iif you merely learn to count.^*N |PG||NT||bt||

The four of hearts is now led from the Dummy,|pc|h4|PG||AT| on which East plays the deuce,|pc|h2|PG||AT| and South makes the ^*Isafety play^*N of the Ace of hearts—refusing the finesse.|pc|hA|PG||AT| West plays the five.|pc|h5|pg||NT|^B@2
South's reason for his play is that he knows that West has several clubs—that non-vulnerable overcall of two clubs was not made on high cards, but on length (probably a six-card suit), and an outside entry. The outside trick is almost certainly the heart King. South cannot afford to take the heart finesse, then, because if it does lose to West, clubs will be continued and East will ruff Dummy's Ace.|PG||NT|^B@2
Having already lost 2 tricks, South would then lose 2 more by taking the trump finesse—a total of 4 tricks (1 heart trick, 2 club tricks, and 1 spade trick). He must play safe with the Ace of hearts and continue with a low heart, because this will either strip East's hand of trumps or will place East in the lead with no way of putting his Partner (West) back in the lead. Even if East should hold three hearts to the King, the contract is safe for West can never lead clubs for his Partner to ruff.|PG||NT|^B@2
At the third trick South leads the trey of hearts,|pc|h3|PG||AT| which West wins with the King,|pc|hK|PG||AT| North dropping the six and East the nine.|pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||at| At this point all of the Opponents' trumps are gone, and South can lose only 2 more tricks—a spade|HC|S4|pg||AT| and a club|HC|C5|AT| [for example]. |PG||AT|South's contract is saved by avoiding that ruff on the Ace of clubs.|sk||PG||pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|d5|pc|c5|pg||sc|y|pg||mc|10|pg||LC|S4C5|NT|^B@2
The time element has an important bearing in this deal. South cannot take the trump finesse because its failure means the loss of a ruffing-trick to the Opponents—2 tricks in all. The safe way is to refuse the finesse and give up a trick to the King, thus eliminating the probable ruff in clubs, and losing one trick instead of probably losing two. |PG||up|16|pf|Y|sc||nt||CP|8|at|^B@2

With neither side vulnerable, the bidding has gone as shown above and West opens the club Queen,|pc|cQ|pg||at| which North wins with the King, East dropping the six and South the five.|PG||pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c5|at| The play of the club King from Dummy is a safety play, because the Declarer's greatest fear is again that East's club holding may be a singleton.|PG||AT| This time South cannot avoid losing a trump trick immediately because the Opponents hold the Ace.|PG||NT|^B@2
West is almost certain to obtain the lead on the first round of trumps. Therefore, if South should obey his natural impulse and win the first trick in his own hand, West would be able to lead the Jack of clubs and East's trump would kill Dummy's King of clubs. By taking the King out of the Dummy immediately, South renders the ruff harmless, ^*Ias he can play low from both hands.|PG||NT|^B@2
At the second trick, the trey of hearts is played from Dummy, on which East plays the four, South the Ten and West wins with the Ace.|PG||pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||at| West's return, as expected, is the club Jack, on which the trey is played from the Dummy, and when East ruffs with the nine of hearts, South is able to play the seven of clubs—retaining his Ace to win the third round of the suit.|PG||pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|h9|pc|c7|pg||NT|^B@2
East is forced to ruff worthless clubs, but if the King remained in the Dummy till the second round, East's ruff would have killed it.|PG||AT| Of course, East could refuse to ruff,|sk||at| but South's Ace would then win, and he would lose but 1 club trick anyway. By making the safety play of Dummy's King on the first trick, South is sure that his club losers will be held to 1 trick. He makes his contract without trouble this way.|PG||sc|y|sk||mc|10|pg||NT|^B@2
This very important safety principle is frequently mishandled. Whenever the Declarer is in danger of a ruff, he should try to arrange his play so that the ruff does as little harm as possible. |PG||UP|12|pf|Y|sc||nt||CP|8|at|^B@2

QX|2p2B04,PROVIDING FOR THE WORST POSSIBLE DISTRIBUTION|

^-{    PROVIDING FOR THE WORST POSSIBLE DISTRIBUTION    }
^-|
CS||CP||FP||AT|^B@2^Y@3Y|FP||AT|ou come now to a second kind of safety play, which consists of playing combinations of honors so that you are ready to handle the worst possible distribution of the outstanding cards. The following deal contains such a safety play:|PG||NT||

With East and West vulnerable, with the above shown bidding,|mb|1sp2sp4sppp|at| West opens the heart King|pc|hK|pg||at| and the play to the first 5 tricks goes as follows:|PG||pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|h7|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s4|NT|^B@2
The safety play is South's lead of the spade King at the fifth trick. South knows that there are four spades outstanding, including the Jack. If they are divided 2-2 or 3-1, they will fall on the Ace, King and Queen leads. However, if they are divided 4-0, the Jack may be set up for a fourth-round winner.|PG||pc|c4|NT|^B@2
The play of the King from the South hand (rather than the Ace from Dummy) eliminates this possibility. If the spades are actually divided 4-0, either East or West must fail to follow suit on the first round. If West is the one who has none, the second round will be won with Dummy's Ace, and South can finesse the Ten on the third round.|PG||NT|^B@2
If the void one should be East, as it is in this particular deal, South can lead a low spade at the sixth trick and finesse Dummy's nine-spot! Dummy's Ace can then be led out, South returning to his own hand with a club, and West's spade Jack is dropped on the lead of the Queen.|PG||pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|c5|pg||

Note that the play of the spade King at the fifth trick protects South against any distribution. The play of the Ace at this point would permit him to make his contract under some circumstances specifically, if the four spades are in East's hand. But if West has all four outstanding spades, the play of the Ace at the fifth trick means that South must lose a spade trick.|PG||NT|^B@2
This same principle applies to all combinations of cards which permit "two-way" finesses if the distribution turns out to be unfavorable. A two-way finesse may be taken either way, depending on which Opponent appears to have the missing honor. |PG||NT|^B@2
The safety play enables the Declarer to discover whether the adverse distribution is such that he can place the missing cards after the first round.

With both sides vulnerable, the bidding has gone as shown above.|mb|1sp2sp3cp4sppp|pg||pc|hK|at| In the preceding example, it was shown to be good policy to start the lead of the trump suit—or, in fact, of any suit—from the hand containing a double honor combination, in order to provide for a two-way finessing position if the adverse distribution should turn out to be unfavorable. But sometimes deals occur in which no two way finessing position is possible.|PG||NT|^B@2
Then the Declarer cannot provide against all kinds of unfavorable distribution, but must content himself with guarding against such bad breaks as he can. In other words, the safety play does not guarantee the contract against any adverse holding, but it provides insurance against most of the possible adverse holdings.|PG||at| The first 5 tricks go as follows:|PG||pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||NT|^B@2
At Trick 3, West leads @HA, North plays @H6, East plays @H4, and South plays @H9. West wins the third round of hearts, since the suit was distributed 4-3-3-3.|PG||pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||at| At Trick 5, South leads @s6,|pc|s6|PG||AT| West discards @C2,|pc|c2|PG||AT| North plays @SA,|pc|sA|PG||AT| and East plays @S2.|pc|s2|PG||NT|^B@2
Dummy's Ace wins. The play of the Ace of spades from Dummy at the fifth trick constitutes the ^*Isafety^*N play. South's only source of danger is the possibility that one Opponent may hold four spades headed by the Jack-Ten.|PG||NT|^B@2
If West holds these cards, no power on earth can prevent him from making a trump trick, as the Ten can force out the Ace at any time and leave the Jack as a certain fourth-round winner. If East holds the four spades, however, the situation is entirely different.|PG||NT|^B@2
South holds K Q 8, which, since the nine-spot is in the Dummy, constitutes a perfect tenace over East's J 10 5. Consequently the lead of the Ace provides against this distribution, while the lead of the King from the Declarer's own hand provides against no contingency of any kind.|PG||at| The rest of the play goes as follows:

The play of the Ace of hearts to the second trick is a safety play, and yet it has the simplest possible reasoning behind it.|PG||pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|hK|pg||NT|^B@2
There are four trumps missing, including the King and the Jack. If West holds both honors and a small one, Declarer must lose 2 tricks no matter what. If West holds King-Jack alone, the Jack will drop and Declarer is faced with losing 1 trick (King of trumps). If West holds, the Jack and a small one, two small ones, or a singleton, South can surely restrict his loss to 1 trick by entering the Dummy and leading a second round of hearts. |PG||NT|^B@2
In other words, the play of the Ace on the second trick provides for every adverse distribution except the one against which the Small Slam could not be made anyway.|PG||

sc|y|sk||mc|13|pg||NT|^B@2
In this particular deal, the safety play of the Ace brings greater reward than hoped for. The singleton King falls, and South need only enter the Dummy in order to finesse against East's Jack. The play which was made to prevent the loss of more than 1 trick actually succeeds in preventing the loss of any tricks at all. Though the safety play is required in any event, here it kept the Declarer from losing the trump finesse to a singleton King. |PG||NT|^B@2
In fact, if West's lone King had won, West would probably have returned a club, forcing Declarer to ruff. Entering the Dummy with a spade, Declarer would have led a second round of hearts on which East would have played the eight. Then South would be faced with a difficult guess. With only the Jack outstanding, he would have to choose between a finesse and playing for the drop, with the percentage slightly in favor of the drop. The safety play of the Ace on the second trick eliminates all this trial and tribulation.|PG||NT|^B@2
If the hearts in this deal are divided 6-3 or 5-4 instead of 7-2, the safety play should still be made. Even if the distribution should be 5-3, the safety play is not a mistake. As a matter of fact, the play should always be made whenever the Declarer can safely give up 1 trick. If the contract were seven hearts instead of only six, in the example just given, the Declarer would probably be set 2 tricks.

If West holds all the trumps, 2 tricks must be lost, but if East holds them all, the play of the Ten limits the loss to 1 trick.

West opens the club Queen,|SK|S|MD|0,SQJ43HT2D764CQJT4,0,HJ9876DT98C98652|pc|cQ|PG||AT| which South wins with the King, North playing the trey and East the deuce.|pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||NT|^B@2
South leads the deuce of spades, which is won with Dummy's seven, West playing the trey and East throwing off the five of clubs.

If the King is led right out, the contract is safe only if West holds all four spades, but is lost if East holds them.

CS||cp||FP||AT|^B@2^Y@3T|FP||AT|he following deal contains a somewhat different type of safety play. The principle involved is encountered quite frequently, and shows how it is often necessary to refuse a finesse for fear that to take it may block the suit.

pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dA|NT|^B@2
South deliberately refuses the diamond finesse in order to avoid blocking the suit. He knows very well that if the finesse should happen to lose, West's first move will be to drive the heart Ace out of the Dummy. This will leave the Declarer with a singleton Ace of diamonds in his own hand, which will prevent the run of Dummy's good diamonds.|pc|d8|PG||NT|^B@2
By refusing the finesse, the Declarer hopes that whichever Opponent holds the King has it guarded only once, when it will have to win the second round. The finesse would win if East held the King and one small card, but the finesse wins only in this situation, whereas the safety play of refusing the finesse wins if either hand holds the King and a small card. Remember that only 5 diamond tricks are needed to fulfill the contract. And the play continues.|PG||
SK||pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||NT|^B@2
At Trick 6, West leads @S8, North discards @H5, East discards @HJ, and South discards @H3. West's eight of spades wins, but the rest of the tricks clearly belong to South, for he has at his command 4 established diamond tricks, the Ace of hearts, and the Ace-King clubs.|PG||

pc|s8|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||mc|9|pg||UP|24|NT|^B@2
If an aside may be permitted at this point, the preceding deal has considerable interest from the point of view of the Defending Side. If West could only read the Declarer's hand, he would abandon spades at the second trick and lead a heart—when the contract will be defeated. The Declarer must stay off of two rounds of hearts in order to strip the West hand of this suit, but if he does this the defense should shift back to spades. The second shift will make South's defeat a certainty.|PG||NT|^B@2
The deal offers another interesting point. If at the third trick, South actually takes the diamond finesse and West wins with the King, West would cash in the Queen of spades, on which everyone must follow suit. If West thereupon led the thirteenth spade, South would discard the diamond Ace and unblock the suit! West, if this situation develops, must refrain from taking his thirteenth spade at this point and shift instead to hearts.|PG||NT|^B@2

If the spades had broken 2-2, the Declarer could have laid down his hand, for his extra heart could be ruffed in the Dummy with the long trump.

Once the trumps do not break right, it is apparent that everything depends on the heart suit. If the hearts are divided 3-3, the contract is made very easily, but if they are divided 4-2, a trick must be lost if the last trump is taken out of Dummy.

South has 3 losing tricks in spades, and he will surely lose all of them if the trumps are taken out of the Dummy.

In order to appreciate the play of this deal, the reader must study the bidding carefully. The bids do not conform entirely to recognized sound methods, for North's spade raise is made without adequate trump support. However, the Ace-King-Queen of diamonds seem to require some sort of action, and the bid of two spades is perhaps the best at North's disposal.|PG||NT|^B@2
The point here is that the bidding by East and West tells a plain story, so crystal clear that the Declarer can all but count the Opponents' hands, especially after he sees West's opening lead. The play proceeds as follows:|PG||pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||at| West's lead is obviously fourth best, and South is thereby enabled to mark East with an original holding of only four hearts.

At this point, South stops to consider. It is obvious that South must lead trumps from the Dummy a second time, but it is also obvious that if he does so by leading diamonds for entry purposes, East will be exhausted of this suit. It will then be a simple matter for East to go up with the Ace of spades on the second round, underlead his Ace of clubs and put his Partner in the lead, so that a diamond can be led for East to ruff with his last trump.

^-|CS||CP||FP||AT|^B@2^Y@3T|FP||AT|he expert takes chances—chances which may mean the loss of his contract only when he has to. If there is anyway of avoiding the risk, or if he can make any play that will give a modicum of safety to his contract, he will surely seize the opportunity gladly. That, after all, is the way an expert player rises from the ranks to a position of importance among champions.|PG||AT|

There are two principal varieties of the safety play. One is executed by giving up 1 trick in order to reduce to a minimum the possibility of losing 2 tricks. The other consists of manipulating honors (when possible) in such a way that the worst possible adverse distribution (if it turns up) can be taken care of.|PG||AT|

Thus a finesse may be refused, and a trick given up to the outstanding honor, in order to avoid the loss of an additional trick if the finesse should fail. Similarly, when faced with an adverse ruff in a suit of which he holds command, the Declarer can sometimes render the ruff useless by maneuvering so that he plays a commanding card after the ruff, and can substitute a lower one if the ruff occurs. When playing a trump suit, the worst possible distribution of the outstanding trumps should always be considered, and the best way found to play the holding so that the worst break will be met at least with your eyes open.|PG||AT|

In general, the safety play is really an application of common sense and foresight. As you plan your play, you consider every possibility—every snag which may lie ahead—and you plan to handle your cards in the best way possible to meet the contingencies that may arise. And you should always choose to play safe, for in Contract Bridge it may safely be said that discretion is always the better part of valor. |PG||HT|X|at| This is the end of Chapter II, Part II. |pg||LF|CH-3-P-2.LIN|
