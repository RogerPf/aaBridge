^-|CS||fp||AT|^B@2^z@3You will find in Part I a detailed analysis of the fundamental aspects of the play of the hand at Contract Bridge. Here you have solid ground work to proceed with the advanced play which will be explained in Part II. Every play used by an expert—every advanced  play of whatever kind—depends upon the fundamental plays covered in the first part of this book. |CP|8|fp|2|
