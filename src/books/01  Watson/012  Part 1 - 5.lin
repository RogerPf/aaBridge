qx|VB01, ENTRIES - Chapter V|HT|e|at|^B@2^Y@3Tenace positions have been discussed thus far as though they were a separate department of play. The necessity of leading from the weak hand toward the strong hand has been emphasized repeatedly; it has been pointed out that it may be necessary to lead in this way two or three times. To do just this—to lead from the hand desired—certain cards in other suits also have to be considered. |

fp||cp||at|
An entry is sometimes called a re-entry when it permits a player to return to the hand after he has already led from it and lost the lead for the time being. When a good player utilizes an entry, he is entering the hand containing it in order to accomplish a particular purpose which he has in mind. |

cp||fp||at|For this reason, you must get in the habit of paying careful attention to the distribution of entries in your partnership hands. Entries are of various kinds; they may be high cards or low cards. Sure winners are, of course, sure entries. Other cards, which are only probable or possible winners, because of cards out against them, are doubtful entries. Even the doubtful entry may be of great importance in Planning the Play of a hand. The following situation, for instance, illustrates the sure entry:|

Suppose again that you are Declarer, and the lead is in your hand. How can you win 3 more tricks? The situation is the same as the preceding one, except that you have no sure entry to the Dummy's hand. Instead you have a doubtful entry (the King of hearts). At any rate, you must make the best of the situation. You therefore lead a heart from your own hand,|

Very often one entry is not enough, especially when it is desirable to lead from the same hand two or three times. Since, in finessing, you always lead from the ^*Bweaker^*N hand, it behooves you to develop as many entries as possible in the weaker hand, so that you will have them available when you need them.|

Study the situation above, in which, since the weak hand (in spades) is the Declarer's hand, the lead must come from South toward North. The lead is in the Dummy. Since, assuming that West holds the King of spades,|md|0,sk87hqj,,|AT| you must lead from your own hand twice in order to capture it.

Notice that if on the second round of spades East follows suit, you know that West's King is now unguarded and will fall on your Ace. The third finesse is therefore unnecessary when East follows suit. If East does not follow suit on the second round, you know that the third spade finesse is required. |

Having won with the Ace of hearts, West must lead a heart or a spade. If he elects to lead a spade, you need not worry about entries, for you merely play the Queen from Dummy (or the Ace if West leads the King). If he chooses a heart, your entry problem is also solved, for your King-Jack is in perfect tenace position over East's Queen.|

This subject is sufficiently complex to be discussed at indefinite length. But only three more examples, all simple, will be given here to clinch the points that have been made. They are the following, all occurring at the eighth trick. In all three the Declarer (South) must be very careful to utilize all his entries properly, for, if he fails to do so, he is extremely liable to find himself in the wrong hand and be forced to lead from his own tenaces—with fatal consequences.|

CP||CS||fp|2|at|^B@2^Y@3S|fp||at|uppose we briefly re-examine the meaning of a "tenace position." Assume that you hold the Ace and Queen of a suit in your hand. |

From what hand should the lead be made in order for you to have the maximum likelihood of taking 2 tricks with the Ace and Queen? |
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


CP|8|AT|The answer is that the lead should be made from the hand on your left. |
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


CP||AT|  In other words, if your left-hand Opponent leads that suit, you will be the last to play to the trick, and you will therefore be in a position to win the trick with whatever card is required. In fact, whenever the lead comes from the hand on your left, your expectation of winning 2 tricks with your Ace-Queen tenace becomes a 100% certainty.|

^x } |HT|p|va|6|AT|^c@2
What is the next most advantageous lead? |
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


AT|The answer is that there are two equally advantageous directions from which the lead may come, provided it cannot come from the left-hand Opponent. |
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


CP||AT|You may lead the suit yourself, from the Dummy's hand up to your Ace-Queen. Also, if your right-hand Opponent leads the suit, it comes up to your Ace-Queen with equal advantage. In both situations, your Queen may be finessed; it wins whenever your right-hand Opponent has the King, and loses when your left-hand Opponent has it.|
pg| ***** 106 ***** |


cs|1|ht|w|at|^b{ |ht|z|at|^y
^x } |HT|w|cp|4|AT|^c@2
The third possible direction of the lead, from your own hand, is the worst, as you know. To lead from your own tenace is disastrous, except in the few rare instances when the missing honor is a singleton and you lead the Ace. In other words, if you must lead from your Ace-Queen holding yourself, you stand practically no chance of winning 2 tricks in that suit.|

CP||CS||fp|2|at|^B@2^Y@3T|fp||at|he situation may be boiled down to the following general truths bearing on the proper play of a suit in which you hold the Ace-Queen tenace in your own hand as Declarer:|
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


FP|2|AT|

^c^*IIf you lead from your own hand, you accomplish nothing.|
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


AT|
^c@2^x@3If you lead from Dummy's hand, or if your right-hand Opponent leads the suit, you are in a position to take a simple finesse.|
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


AT|
^c@2^x@3If your left-hand Opponent is forced to lead the suit, you are presented with an "automatic" finesse—in other words, your Ace-Queen is placed in a definitely winning position over BOTH Opponents.^*N|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


FP||AT|

To control the lead so far as your hand and the Dummy's are concerned, you must pay strict attention to your available entries and utilize them to your best advantage. As to the problem of securing a lead from either Opponent, especially when it will be to your advantage, that will be solved as soon as you learn some of the further strategy of play, explained in later chapters.|
pg| ***** 112 ***** |


at|

^*IEvery combination of cards in which one or more honors is missing is but a variation of the Ace-Queen tenace^*N. The direction of the lead has exactly the same effect upon it. Whenever the lead is from the Opponent on the ^*Ileft^*N of the tenace, the tenace has the best chance to win. A lead from the opposite hand is equal in value to a lead from the Opponent on the right of the tenace. |
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


CP|8|FP|2|at|To lead from the tenace itself is the least likely to prove at all profitable. |
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


FP||AT| Every situation that ever arises in the play of the cards, even if it seems different, is governed by this fundamental principle. No matter what different aspect any combination of cards may appear to take, it is only wearing a cloak—you need but apply this principle in some form, and the problem is solved. This will become clearer and clearer as you progress from elementary to advanced play.|

CP||CS||at|^B@2^Y@3The essential lesson of this chapter has been the importance of entries. Only by being able to lead from the proper hand at a strategic moment can you hope to reap the full harvest of your winners and probable winners. On entries depends your freedom of choice in handling your cards. Watch all entry cards—and cherish them. Develop further entries, and plan to have entries available as you proceed. You will learn many ways of doing this as you take up the ensuing chapters.|

{    Reflection on the Chapter by Howard Schutzman   }
^-|CS||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| I do not believe this Chapter needs much expanding. However, here are a couple of points which I always emphasis during our mentoring sessions.|
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


AT|

1) This chapter emphasizes the importance of planning your declarer play, just as I do. Planning how you use your entries to your best advantage is one of the key elements of a successful declarer plan.|
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


AT|

2) The chapter also touches on the reason for second hand low. It demonstrates how being the fourth hand to play to a trick is the most advantageous, because if you cannot win the trick, you can at least play a low card, and not waste a high card to force out an opponent's high card. Third hand is the least advantageous on many tricks, because you have to play a high card to force out a high card from the opponent. Since second hand is the first hand to play to a particular trick, normally second hand should play low, which forces third hand to play high, hopefully allowing partner to capture one of the opponents's honors with a higher honor.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


AT|

3) The chapter also alludes to the general principle of how to execute an "end play", an advanced declarer play technique. If you have a tenace you want to protect, and can throw your left hand opponent in and force him to lead the suit with the tenace, you can use your tenace to maximum advantage, because you will be the fourth hand to play on that trick. That is the essence of an end play. The rest is details on how you accomplish that.|
