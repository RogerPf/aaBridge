qx|82B01,TWO UNUSUAL ECHOES|
nt||HT|d|at|
^B@2^Y@3In addition to the ordinary echo given along with the other fundamental principles (in Part I), there are two other interesting and occasionally useful echoes, or conventional discards. They consist of a |CP|8|AT|trump echo|CP||AT| and a |CP|8|AT|no-trump echo|CP||AT|. |
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

In Auction Bridge, the trump echo was known as “^*Ithe three-card  peter^*N," |CP|8|AT| * |CP||FP||AT| and was always used to inform Partner of the fact that three trumps were held. For example, if a defensive player held, in the trump suit, the eight, five and deuce, he would play the five-spot on the first lead of trumps, and follow with the deuce on the second round, to convey the information that an additional trump was held. If he failed to use this echo, his failure told his Partner that he held originally either two trumps or four.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^Y@3* |CP||AT|The word ^*Ipeter^*N as used here has no relation to the masculine name Peter. The origin may be traced back to the ^*Iblue peter^*N a trump signal (calling for a trump lead from Partner) used in Whist, which was so called from the nautical term ^*Iblue peter^*N, a corruption of ^*I"blue repeater^*N," used in signaling with flags. The ^*I"three-card peter^*N" was merely a loose modification of the original Whist term, to indicate a signal made in the trump suit, but not to induce Partner to lead trumps.—Sam Fry, Jr.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


at|
^B@2^Y@3The experience of Contract players has modified this convention to make it more useful. At Contract Bridge, a player should not echo in trumps simply because he held three of them originally, but he should confine his echoing to show ability to ruff some side suit.|

pg| ***** 8 ***** |


NT|^B@2
At the second trick, South leads a heart, which—we will assume for the sake of argument—West ducks. Dummy plays the Ten, and ^*IEast plays the eight.^*N|PC|h2h5hth8|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now the Queen of hearts is led, and East play the three. West wins this trick with the Ace, and he now knows, through the trump echo used by East, that East has one more heart. He also knows that East wants to ruff something, and the only possibility is spades.|pc|hqh3|SB|WGot it. That must be a trump echo!|

West follows with a third round of spades,|pc|s2st|

pg| ***** 15 ***** |


sc|y|sk||NT|^B@2
If this convention of the ^*Itrump echo^*N were not used in the foregoing example, West would be forced to guess whether to continue spades or shift to diamonds. It is true that he might now and then guess correctly, but the ^*Itrump echo^*N convention eliminates the uncertainty. |

The present deal illustrates the reverse of the principle. The bidding is the same as on the preceding example,and neither side vulnerable.|mb|1h1s2hp4hppp|

West opens the spade King,|PC|sk|

SK||AT|^*b consequently West will shift to some other suit. West, guessing that a diamond trick cannot be established in time, shifts to clubs, and East and West thereupon make 2 club tricks, 1 heart trick, and 1 spade trick. On this deal the negative inference was even more valuable than the positive inference in the preceding example. |

^-{    The No-Trump Echo    }
^-|
cp||at|^B@2^Y@3The no-trump echo is another interesting little gadget for signaling purposes. It is used to show the possession of only two cards of a suit when a long suit in the Dummy threatens to become established. It enables the hand holding the controlling cards to count the distribution of this particular suit with unerring accuracy, and frequently stops him from making an unnecessary hold-up. The no-trump echo may, like the trump echo, also be used negatively, which makes it an extremely valuable convention. The following deal shows the positive use of the no-trump echo: |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |

PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This effectively shuts the Dummy out of the play, and South must go down 1 trick, for he can then take only 2 club tricks, 1 diamond trick, 3 heart tricks, and 2 spade tricks. Without this convention, East would be hard put to it to guess how many clubs Declarer held originally in his own hand. |

NT|^B@2
This is very worth while, for if Declarer is allowed to make 2 club tricks on this deal, he will make his contract.  |

{    Summary    }
^-|CS||CP||AT|^B@2^Y@3The trump echo—the play of a high trump on the first round of the suit, followed by a lower trump on the next round—indicates the possession of at least one more trump and also the possession of ruffing power in a side suit. Acting upon this signal, Partner may be instructed to play in a way that will defeat the Declarer’s contract. Failure to echo in trumps indicates that no ruffing power in another suit is held. |
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


AT|
 
The no-trump echo—the play of a high card on the first round of the suit, followed by a lower card on the next round—indicates the possession of a doubleton in a suit of which the visible Dummy holds practically all the high cards, and thereby gives the Partner an accurate count on the number of cards held by the Declarer. When the Dummy has no outside entries, this echo tells Partner whether to hold up, and, if so, for how many rounds. Failure to employ the echo tells Partner that more than two cards are held in the suit. |CP|8|fp|2|AT|*|CP||
