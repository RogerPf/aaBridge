qx|4P201,Defense Against End Plays|
nt||HT|E|at|^B@2^Y@3Some end plays, once envisioned, are as inevitable as the impact of a falling body once it has started to fall. They can no more be prevented, even by the most astute defending player, than the attraction of gravity can be annihilated. But all end plays are not so surely predictable in their outcome, for against many types of end plays there is available certain more or less effective defensive strategy. If a player on the Defending Side is alert enough to see that the Declarer is preparing for an end play, he can quite frequently perceive at just what vulnerable spot the end play is to be directed and perhaps escape the trap by failing to do as the Declarer wants him to do. |PG||AT|

Just as the preparation for an end play must often start very early in the hand—sometimes at the very first trick—so the defense against an end play must also begin early. If the defense does not get under way in time, at the moment the defending player is thrown in the lead it may be entirely too late to do anything about the situation. By that time the end play has been consummated.|PG||AT|

The advice given for defensive play, in the chapters dealing with fundamentals (in Part I of this book), applies equally well to advanced defensive play against the advanced technique of an expert Declarer. The advice was this:|CP|8|AT| always try to figure out what the Declarer is attempting to do, and prevent him from carrying out his plans, if you can.|CP||AT| There is a tactical advantage in this method of defending a hand, and there is also a psychological advantage. Many a Declarer, when he suddenly discovers that his Opponents have been "wise to him" all along, is for the moment thrown off his balance. Sometimes his surprise is so great, particularly if he has underestimated the caliber of his adversaries, that he never regains his savoir faire, and becomes an easy victim to Opponents who are merciless now that they have caught him.|PG||AT|
	
In essence, the Defense Against End Plays is but an extended application of playing the Declarer's game mentally in order to out-maneuver him in the end. But there are certain tactics—certain mechanical methods, if they may be so called—which you must know. These are set forth in the following deals, all of which illustrate successful defense against a threatening end play. |PG||nt||bt||

cp||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3T|FP||AT|he defending player, perceiving that the Declarer is going to throw him in the lead at a time when he must lead back a suit the Declarer wishes to have led, can sometimes escape the fate that threatens him by getting rid of the high card with which the Declarer expects to put him in the lead. The following deal, for example, is exactly the same as one in which a successful end play was executed (in the preceding chapter), except that West has been given the trey of clubs in place of the Queen, and the Queen has been placed in the East hand. The cards are otherwise exactly the same. But now West has a chance to evade the end play by nice side-stepping at the ninth trick. Watch closely!  |PG||nt||

You can open any hand by clicking that seat. Further, you can plan the play before clicking the forward arrow and see Watson's instructions.|PG||pc|sj|NT|^B@2

The stage is now set for the end play. At this point South leads the Ace of clubs and would like to follow with a small club, to put West in the lead—he hopes!—with the King of clubs. In the preceding Chapter West was forced to win with his King, for he held King-Queen doubleton originally. Holding the King and small originally, however, West can prevent the end play by simply unblocking himself out of the projected throw-in, thus:|PG||
pc|cA|pc|cK|SK||NT|^B@2
Now that West has thrown off his King under South's Ace, keeping the trey instead, the Declarer's plans are completely frustrated. Declarer knows he is beaten the minute he sees that King flung out. To lead a small club to the tenth trick will be futile, for it will throw East in the lead, who can take 2 more club tricks. If only West had held on to his King and played the trey on the Ace-then, at the next trick, West would have paid the penalty for his gluttony by being forced to lead back a suit that would give the Declarer a ruff and a discard.|PG||NT|^B@2
The principle embodied in this example is a most important one for avoiding being thrown in the lead at an awkward moment. Whenever a high card or cards appear to be dangerous, it is a good idea to begin unblocking by throwing them off at the earliest chance. Sometimes the need for unblocking will not materialize, and if it does not, you can always change your mind at the last minute. In this deal, the throwing off of West's King may cost 1 trick, but it is the only chance of setting the contract.|PG||NT|^B@2
How does West know that South has an end play in view? Simply by counting—counting the cards that have been played. He knows that South has no more spades, and he can see that the Dummy has no more. His count of diamonds tells him that all are gone except the King he has left. No clubs have been played. The Declarer has lost 2 tricks already, and he stands to lose the King of clubs and possibly another club trick, for West knows that only two hearts remain unplayed, which means that Declarer must have them (Ace-King), and that his other three cards are clubs. |PG||NT|^B@2
Even if the Declarer has both Ace and Queen of clubs, he must lose 2 club tricks—unless he can give up 1 club trick and force an Opponent to lead him a spade or a diamond, which he can ruff in one hand and discard a club from the other. West sees that his King of clubs will do just this for the Declarer on the second round of the suit, and he therefore unblocks by flinging it on the Ace. |PG||NT|^B@2
Declarer's lead of the Ace tells West that he has decided not to attempt the finesse, and that the end play offers better chances. The way to circumvent him is to throw off the King in the chance that the Declarer does not have the Queen.|PG||pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||mc|9|pg||NT|^B@2

Certainly the bidding is highly optimistic, and the North and South partners reach a contract they have no right to, but it so happens, in spite of that, that the cards lie in such positions that only the most expert defense can defeat the Slam. The end play that South attempts would work with a great many average players sitting in the West position on this deal.

^B@2West leads the Jack of diamonds, and the Dummy goes down.|PG||AT| The outlook for South does not seem very bright, as two finesses appear to be necessary. Yet there may be a way of avoiding the club finesse. Assuming that West holds the King of hearts, South can strip the hand down, take the heart finesse, and throw West in the lead with the King of hearts, forcing him to lead back into the club Ace-Queen tenace. Declarer decides to try this, and the play proceeds as follows:|PG||pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d9|at| The lead is back with South, and the stage has been set for the proposed end play. The end play succeeds if West fails to defend against it properly, as follows:|pg||sk||

pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|h7|pc|hK|SK||NT|^B@2
Here West is thrown in the lead, as South planned, and he must now lead either a diamond (which permits the Declarer to ruff in the Dummy and discard the Queen of clubs from his own hand) or a club (which plays right into the Declarer's Ace-Queen tenace). Thus South makes a contract at which he arrived by what was really preposterous bidding.|pg||mc|12|pg||NT|^B@2
But West, with his wits about him, should have anticipated this! He should foresee that the Declarer will try to throw him in the lead in order to avoid taking the gamble that the club finesse offers. ^*UCertainly the Declarer must have something in his hand to justify his highly optimistic bidding, and he is therefore practically certain to hold the Ace-Queen of clubs.^*N In the first 5 tricks, if West has counted the hand as he should, he knows that Declarer has stripped his own hands of diamonds, and has also drawn all the adverse trumps, having two left in Dummy and three in his own hand.|PG||NT|
^B@2West can see that the heart finesse will work, but that Declarer may easily have a losing heart to boot, and a club tenace to worry about. West should see that his only chance of defeating the contract depends on whether he can keep an exit card |CP|8|FP|2|at|*|CP||FP||AT| in his hand.

Here, note West's spectacular discard of the Jack. Seeing what the Declarer is up to, he starts to unblock immediately. Note also East's play of the Ten—East has his eyes open, and plays the Ten to show that he has the nine—further to encourage his Partner in the unblocking procedure.|pg||

CS||CP||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3F|FP||AT|requently situations arise where it should be apparent to a player on the defense that the Declarer is planning to throw his partner into the lead in order to force a favorable return. At times such as these it behooves him to find some way to block these plans. He can often do this by attempting to gain the lead himself.

Ordinarily this hand would be a lay-down. All that is necessary to make the success of the contract absolutely certain is a 3-1 break in spades. Since the spades are actually divided 4-0,|SK|E|pg||AT| 1 trump trick must be lost,|PG||sk|s|AT| and possibly 1 club trick. |pg||SK|S|NT|^B@2

Yes, what you witnessed is correct. South leads @DJ, West plays @DQ, North ruffs with @SQ, and East under trumps with @S8. A trick glittering with two brilliant plays! At this, the ninth trick, the Declarer cannot afford to ruff low in the Dummy, for he thinks East is probably exhausted of diamonds, and if East overtrumps there will later be a club trick lost also. Hence the ruff with the Queen of trumps, by which the Declarer hopes to induce East to throw off a club. |PG||NT|^B@2
If Mr. von Zedtwitz had done this, the Declarer would have cashed in his Ace and led a third round of the suit so that, having nothing but trumps left, East would have been forced to ruff his Partner's good trick and then lead a trump away from his guarded Jack.

The Declarer did not give up hope until the tenth trick had been completed.

The Declarer faces defeat, and knows it. If he leads a club, the trick will be won by West. If he leads a trump, East's Jack-nine represents a sure trick. Of course, if East could be made to lead. But Mr. von Zedtwitz has evaded all possibility of being thrown in the lead now.|PG||NT|^B@2
The Declarer's play of this particular hand was little short of inspired, and it really deserved to succeed.

It is easy enough to say that the Declarer could make his contract by playing the Ace of hearts on the eleventh trick and dropping West's King. In actual play, however, it is very difficult to do this, in view of all the possibilities, and for this reason the Declarer cannot be criticized for taking the finesse. |PG||NT|^B@2
West simply took advantage of his opportunity to throw sand in the Declarer's eyes. But the Declarer did make an earlier mistake on the hand—he should never have thrown off Dummy's Ten of spades. By keeping this card in the Dummy he had a perfect squeeze on West—but we have not yet taken up squeeze plays, so this cannot be discussed now. |PG||MC|10|PG||UP|44|pf|Y|sc||nt|

^-|CS||CP||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3A|FP||AT|s in practically all plays at Contract Bridge, the most essential thing about defending against possible end plays is counting the cards as they fall. This will enable you very often to see what the Declarer is up to, in time for you to take some steps to defend yourself against his scheme. Once you have an idea of what the Declarer is trying to do, it is a comparatively simple matter for you to find any defensive tactics that the gods of distribution may have placed at your disposal.|PG||AT|

Perhaps the most common defense against an end play is to unblock in the suit which the Declarer seems likely to use for throwing you in the lead. You defeat his purpose by getting rid of the high card so that he cannot throw you in. This defense works perfectly whenever your Partner is able to retain a card for controlling the third or fourth round of the suit—which means that your Partner instead of you will be thrown in. You perceive, of course, that you are the one the Declarer wishes to have in the lead, by noticing that it may help the Declarer to lead into a tenace he holds, or to lead a card which will give him a ruff and a discard. Other times it is necessary to go up with a high honor in order to try and prevent your partner from being thrown into the lead.|PG||AT|

Another mode of defense is to play in such a way that the Declarer is forced to guess. If you raise a doubt in the Declarer's mind as to the location of a key card, he may be misled into what he thinks is a better play-to his sorrow.|PG||AT|

Of course, you cannot always evade an end play. Nor can you always be right in your appraisal of the situation. But you will find it one of the great thrills of the game to outwit a clever Declarer, even if you succeed in doing it only once in a great while. |PG||AT|
