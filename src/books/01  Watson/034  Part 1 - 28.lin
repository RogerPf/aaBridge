qx|28B01,OVER-RUFFING BY THE DEFENDING SIDE|
NT||HT|E|at|^B@2^Y@3Now that you know how important it often is to force the Declarer to ruff whenever your side holds any length in the trump suit, even though it may not do you any good, you are ready to discover how forcing the Declarer may become a specific means of obtaining more tricks. |
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

Generally, forcing can do the Defending Side no harm—you saw one or two instances, however, in which you should refrain from forcing. But now and then, when you lead a suit which Declarer can ruff, it not only does your side no harm but actually enables your Partner also to ruff, when Partner is playing after the Declarer. Thus Partner has an opportunity to over-ruff—both winning the trick and capturing one of Declarer's precious trumps.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|

Consider this a moment. You already know something about the strategic advantage of playing after another player, particularly when tenaces are held. This is just as true in the trump suit as in any other suit, and it is also true when you play after a ruffing player and you can ruff yourself. Thus trump honors increase in value whenever their holder can play them after the Declarer, especially when playing Third or Fourth Hand to the trick. Take, for example, the following simple illustration:|

Spades are trumps: South is Declarer. It seems at first glance that Declarer must certainly win the rest of the tricks. However, he cannot win them all if East (your Partner) has the lead at this point.|

AT|and you must eventually win a trick with your Jack, which has been promoted to a third-round winner. Note that, if Partner leads a heart, South will win the trick with his Ace and proceed to draw your trumps. Your Jack cannot possibly be turned into a trick unless Partner has the lead and leads a suit in which both the Declarer and you are lacking any cards.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The same sort of promotion occurs when you are able to over-ruff the Declarer no matter what he plays. In this example, your Jack was really in tenace position over the Ace-King-Queen because it gained value from the fact that your hand played after the Declarer. The actual holding is, of course, not a tenace, but the principle can be seen more clearly if the relationship is understood.|

This example contains a combination which really looks like a tenace. Spades are trumps; South is Declarer. Again both your hand (West) and South's are void in diamonds. Theoretically, your spade holding is worth only 1 trick, as the Declarer can simply lead his high honors until your Ace is driven out, and later pick up the rest of your low trumps. |
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT|^B@2
He holds four honors, while you hold but four cards in the suit, only one of which is higher than any of his. However, there is one way in which you can obtain 2 spade tricks—if Partner is in the lead at this point.|

You are now faced with the problem of whether to play your spade Ace immediately.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


lb|*CAs West which card would you play? The quiz is not in the book.^^h5^sA932h65d-c8|at| A moment's reflection will show that you should hold on to it. If you win this trick with the Ace, you will have to return a spade, a heart, or a club. Any of these cards can be won by the Declarer, who will then draw your remaining trumps and capture the rest of the tricks without hindrance. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT|^B@2
By refusing to play the Ace, you promote your nine-spot. Let us suppose that on this trick you throw off a low heart. |

NT|^B@2
You thus see that this example really illustrates the establishment of a tenace through a refusal to over-ruff. This establishment was owing entirely to the fact that you were playing after the Declarer. You will also see that the principle involved is the same as the one illustrated in the first example deal of this chapter. |

Take this deal. South is Declarer at a contract of four hearts, and you open your singleton spade from the West position.|

By refusing to over-ruff,|PC|C3S4|

NT|^B@2
Do you see anything wrong with this deal? Is there any way in which the Declarer could make his contract?|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


AT| Yes, he could make his contract by going about it somewhat differently. South made a fatal mistake when he ruffed the second round of spades with one of his honors.|

You would have won the trick with the eight, but subsequently you would have been able to win only 1 more trump trick, as South would still hold the K Q J against, your A 10 9, and Partner would never be able to regain the lead.|

^-{    LEADING A LOW CARD FOR OVER-RUFFING    }
^-|
CS||CP||fp||AT|^B@2^Y@3S|FP||AT|ometimes the question of over-ruffing is not so simple, particularly for the player who forces the Declarer. This player, Partner of the one who is to over-ruff, very often faces the necessity of leading a card which both the Declarer and you (let us say) can ruff but which at the same time establishes a trick in the Dummy. Under these circumstances it is usually advisable for Partner to lead a low card. This play may or may not allow the Declarer a discard, but in most such instances the lead of a high card is sure to. Take, for example, the following deal:|

PG| ***** 55 ***** |


pc|hkh9h6h3|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


at| when everybody follows suit, you know that neither the Declarer nor your Partner holds any more hearts. It is apparent, therefore, that you are obliged to give your Partner a chance to ruff the third round. The only trouble is that, if you lead the heart Ace, the Dummy's Queen will be established for the fourth round and a discard. |
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You should lead, not the Ace, but a low heart, knowing that the Declarer cannot afford to discard at this point, but must ruff.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


pc|hj|at| If he discards a loser, he loses this trick—his third—which defeats his contract forthwith.|sk||
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now the Declarer cannot avoid, eventually, losing the Queen of diamonds.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


AT| Had you led the heart Ace, Declarer would have ruffed with the Jack of clubs, drawn trumps, and used his heart Queen in the Dummy to discard his diamond Queen on. The lead of a low heart accomplishes the same—aim to give Partner a chance to ruff or over-ruff—and is safe.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Of course, the situation would be different if the Dummy contained no entry. Then, the lead of the Ace would be permissible.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Let us look at this matter of over-ruffing from the standpoint of the Declarer. In this example, his best play was to ruff high, refusing to accept the chance to discard the diamond Queen.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Generally speaking, this is not true, for if he holds some card which he must lose no matter what else happens, he may as well get rid of it. Take the following deal as an example of this:|

NT|^B@2
At this point, you are quite tempted to ruff with the eight of spades, since you know that you cannot be over-ruffed. However, what good will it do you? You hold in your hand 2 potential losing tricks in hearts. One of these you can discard on the extra diamond in the Dummy, but the other must be lost eventually. ^*N|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Why not lose it immediately?|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


pc|h5|at| You retain at least your original length in spades, and know that after West has ruffed he can do no further damage. You therefore throw off a low heart on this trick, and let West ruff to his heart's content.|

^-{    SUMMARY    }
^-|
CS||CP||fp||AT|^B@2^Y@3T|FP||AT|he principles explained in this Chapter have frequent application. Quite often they give rise to rather complex problems for both the Declarer and the Defending Side. In their connection, you should always remember three things, as follows:|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


AT|

(1) never be reluctant, as Declarer, to throw off a card that is a sure loser anyway, even though to do so means you lose the current trick—one trick is as good as another, if you must lose it anyway; |
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


AT|

(2) never ruff blindly in a defending position, but look around to see whether your trump holding can be improved by refusing to over-ruff;|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


AT|

(3) be very careful in giving your Partner a chance to over-ruff that you do not establish any tricks in the Dummy. |
