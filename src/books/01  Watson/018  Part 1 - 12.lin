qx|12B01,Trump Management at Suit Play|
nt||HT|e|at|^B@2^Y@3The time has come to consider not only no-trump play, but play at a suit contract. The distinguishing characteristic of suit play is that one of the four suits (that named in the final bid, which becomes the contract) has greater trick-taking power than any of the other three suits. This is the ^*Itrump suit.^*N Thus, if the final bid is three diamonds, the trump suit for that hand is ^*Idiamonds^*N; if the final bid is any number of no-trump, there is no trump suit for that hand. Any card of the trump suit wins a trick to which it is played provided no higher trump is played to that trick. |PG||AT|

Whereas, at no-trump, ^*Ithe highest card of the suit led^*N wins the trick, at suit play the highest card of the suit led wins except when one or more trumps are played, when the highest trump wins. The trump suit therefore becomes of extreme importance in suit play. At no-trump all the suits are of equal value; you would just as soon have a long club suit as a long spade suit. At a suit contract, length in the trump Suit is of first and overwhelming importance. This elementary preamble is stated here so that the player will remember that trump plays are based on the commanding power of the trump suit.|PG||AT|

Except when the trump suit is led, a player may play a trump only when he cannot follow suit. This fact, which every Bridge player knows, brings to the front another distinguishing feature of suit play. As soon as the Declarer, playing a suit contract, is void in a suit and also possesses trumps, he controls the void suit with his trumps. A trump may therefore be a controlling card, in addition to the high cards which were the only controlling cards at no-trump.|PG||NT||
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
HT|e|at|^B@2^Y@3Also, the reader must remember that ^*Ievery principle of no-trump play is applicable to suit play as well.^*N The only change is the dominating position of the trump suit. And just as soon as all the trumps are played, which may quite often happen long before the full 13 tricks are won or lost, the  remainder of even a trump hand must be played exactly as in no-trump. |CP|8|AT|The factor of first importance in suit play, as distinguished from no-trump play, is the trump suit itself. |CP||AT|That suit is so valuable that its proper management for the best interests of the whole hand is absolutely essential. |PG||AT| 

To be sure, whenever the contract is at a suit, it may be taken for granted that nine times out of ten the Declarer and Dummy will hold more trumps than the Opponents. All systems of bidding require that a suit cannot be bid unless it contains at least four cards, and require further that a player cannot support a suit bid by his partner unless he holds at least three cards in it. The partnership hands will, therefore, in reaching a suit contract, contain at least seven trumps, and probably more. These trumps may not include all the high cards of the suit. The Opponents may even win trump tricks, but this is no cause for alarm, as a rule. |PG||NT||

^-{    WHEN TO LEAD TRUMPS    }
^-|cp||at|^B@2^Y@3The problem of when to lead trumps, and when not to lead trumps, is one of the most difficult for the beginner to solve correctly. |pg||CP|8|AT|More hands are wrecked by failure to lead trumps at the right time or by leading trumps at the wrong time than by any other form of poor play|CP||pg||AT|. And this error in judgment is nearly always inexcusable. The proper management of trump leads is really so simple that, once understood, it should never bother any player.|PG||AT|

Trumps are controlling cards. The fact that if a player cannot follow suit he may play a trump and thereby win a trick headed even by the Ace or King of the suit led, is the clearest indication of the controlling strength of trumps. The deuce of trumps may quite often be far more valuable than the Ace of any other suit.
|PG||AT|
You will recall that, at no-trump, when a player holds only the Ace of a suit the Opponents are likely to win 5 or 6 tricks in that suit as soon as the Ace is driven out. At a suit contract this unhampered cashing in of established tricks in an adverse suit is impossible, for as soon as either the Declarer or the Dummy becomes exhausted of that suit he can step in and halt the run with a small trump. Hence the establishment of a suit by the Opponents, when the contract is at a suit, need not be a source of half the anxiety it may cause the Declarer playing a hand at no-trump.|PG||AT|

That the most valuable trumps are high trumps is axiomatic. Low trumps may become "high" as soon as all higher ones have been played. If all the trumps from the Ace down to and including the seven-spot have been played, and the Declarer still has left in one hand the six, five, four, and three, he is just as certain of taking 4 tricks with these cards as he would be of taking 4 tricks with four Aces at no-trump. No matter how many high cards the Opponents may hold in the other suits, nothing can prevent the Declarer from taking 4 tricks with his remaining four high trumps.|PG||NT||

^-{    WHEN TO LEAD TRUMPS - Continued    }
^-|cp||at|^B@2^Y@3However, if the higher trumps have not been played, the small trumps may be captured by higher trumps held adversely. This can be prevented by ridding the Opponents' hands of their trumps at the earliest opportunity. This is called drawing trumps. |pg||CP|8|FP|2|AT|As a general principle, except in the instances when other factors must be considered, the Opponents' trumps should be drawn at once.|PG||FP||CP||AT|

This may be effectively stated as follows:|CP|1|cp|4|FP|2|AT|^-

AT A SUIT CONTRACT
        THE FIRST SUIT THE DECLARER SHOULD TRY TO ESTABLISH        
IS ALMOST ALWAYS THE
TRUMP SUIT 
 }
^-|PG||FP||cs||CP||AT|

The low trumps are established, or made high trumps, in exactly the same ways that a regular suit is established at no-trump. If you hold the high trumps to start with, you must lead them until the Opponents have no more. If you do not hold the high trumps originally, but have the greater length, you must still lead trumps in order to exhaust the Opponents so that your own lower trumps will be in full control later.|PG||AT|

The following deal is a simple example of drawing trumps:|pg||nt||

You see now the difference between no-trump and suit play;|PG||AT| at no-trump East's Queen must win.|PG||AT| But here spades are trumps. Since you have no more clubs, you can play a small spade (the four-spot),|PG||AT| thereby winning the trick by ruffling.|cp|8|at|^*B*^*N|cp||at||PG||NT|
^B@2|cp|8|at|^*I* "Ruffing" |cp||at|and|cp|8|at| "trumping" |cp||at|are synonymous terms. "Ruff" was the name of an old game of cards preceding, and closely resembling Whist. The name came to be applied to the act of trumping because this mode of winning a trick was the outstanding characteristic of the play. At Whist all hands were played with some suit as trump; the no-trump contract came into use with Bridge.

You have four spades left in your hand, and four in the Dummy, making nine accounted for (you have already played one). The Opponents hold only four trumps between them, then. If these are divided 2-2, they will fall on your Ace and King; if they are divided 3-1, you will still capture them all if the singleton is the Queen. In any event, this suit must be the point of your immediate attack. You lead your Ace at once and follow it with the King. |PG||

^-{    WHEN TO LEAD TRUMPS - Continued    }
^-|cp|8|at|^B@2^Y@3
The first thing a player should learn is to lead trumps as soon as possible. |pg||CP||AT|The second thing he should learn about trump management is that, on about half the hands he will play at a suit contract, leading trumps should be postponed—when the reason for doing so is clear in the player's mind.|CP||PG||fp|2|cs|1|cp|4|AT|^-

{
 Generally speaking, unless some good reason exists for not leading them, trumps should 
 always be led as soon as possible by the Declarer.
 Even though drawing the adverse trumps may not seem particularly advantageous,
 nevertheless a good purpose is served in establishing definite control cards.
}^-|PG||fp||Cp||cs||AT|

If all of the Opponents' trumps but one have been eliminated, and this last lone trump is a small card, it is still advisable, usually, to get rid of it as quickly as possible—even if you have to use two of your own trumps (one from your hand and one from Dummy) to do so. As a rule, nothing can be gained by waiting. If you wait, the Opponent may find an opportunity to use his small trump to some advantage. But if the one outstanding trump is higher than any of yours, there is no good reason for you to waste two of your trumps in disposing of it. For example, suppose the trump situation is as follows:|PG||AT|
|HT|v|AT|^D@S 9 5 4
|HT|w|AT|^B@S Q J 10 ^F@s 7 6
|ht|x|at|^D@s A K 8 4 2 |pg|
|ht|u|at|^H@2^y@3Spades are trumps; you lead your Ace and King, dropping all the adverse trumps but the Queen in West's hand. This Queen is the highest outstanding trump, and must win a trick no matter what happens. In order to eliminate that Queen you must waste one of the trumps left in your hand and also the last trump in Dummy's hand. |pg||ht|x|va|5|at|^b@2^y@3Yet you do not eliminate a possible adverse trick; you merely sacrifice two of your trumps unnecessarily to an outstanding trump which can never be worth more or less than 1 trick. Under these circumstances, it is much better to lead other suits and allow West, if he will, to use his Queen to ruff a trick.|PG||NT||
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
HT|e|cs|1|cp|4|fp||

^-{    WHEN TO LEAD TRUMPS - Continued    }
^-|cp||cs||at|^B@2^Y@3
The situation takes on still another color when there are two outstanding trumps, both high. Here there is always a chance that they will be divided between the Opponents and will therefore fall together. If they fall on the same trick, they win only 1 trick, but if they are allowed to remain unmolested, one Opponent, may very often find a chance to make a trick with his trump separately from his Partner's. |pg||at| The following two situations illustrate this point: 

|HT|L|AT|^F@H 9 5 ^R@H 5
|HT|N|FP|1|AT|^B1. |fp||at|^D@H Q 10 7 ^H@H J 7 6 |fp|1|AT|^M2.|fp||AT|^O@H Q 10 7 ^U@H J 9 6
|ht|P|at|^F@H A K 8 4 2 ^R@H A K 8 4 3 2 |pg||ht|Q|AT|^b@2^y@3


In both situations you, as Declarer (South), hold seven trumps. Assuming that the rest of the hand does not throw a different complexion on the situation, your only troubles are centered in the trump suit. Your proper play in both instances is to lead out the Ace and King, followed by a small card on the third round. If the adverse trumps are divided 3-3, as in both examples above, this play assures you of losing but 1 trump trick. Even if the adverse trumps are not divided 3-3, nothing is lost by this mode of play, for the tricks that must be lost will have to be lost ultimately anyway.|pg||nt||

^-{    WHEN NOT TO LEAD TRUMPS IMMEDIATELY    }
^-|cp||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3
A very common occurrence which necessitates postponement of the trump lead is a finessing situation which must be taken advantage of while entries are still available. The following deal drives home this point.|PG||NT||
sk|s|pn|You,,,|st||md|3SAQT84H973D86CA84,S65HJ85DAKT5CJ973,SJ73HAQT4D942CK62,SK92HK62DQJ73CQT5|sv|0|rh||ah|Deal 2|NT|^B@2
You are the Declarer playing a contract of four spades.|mb|p|mb|p|mb|4S|an|To speed up the play|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pg||
pc|dK|at| West's opening lead is the King of diamonds,|PG||pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dA|at| followed by the Ace,|PG||pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d5|AT| and, on the third round, the five of diamonds.|PG||pc|d9|pc|dJ|at|
When this third diamond trick comes up to your hand, you have no more of the suit led and therefore trump with the four of spades.|PG||pc|s4|pg||NT|^B@2
Looking at the hand as a whole, you see that you have a perfect finessing position in trumps (spades), but you cannot finesse if you lead trumps immediately, for you are in the wrong hand. You therefore do not lead trumps at the fourth trick, but cast about for some means of entering Dummy's hand. |pg||NT|^B@2
You have two certain entries to the Dummy: the heart Ace and club King. You have two more entries that are possible: the heart Queen and the heart Ten. The heart Queen offers a distinct probability as an entry card, but the Ten cannot be considered with any seriousness, for both the King and Jack must be in West's hand if the Ten is to become an actual entry.|PG||NT|^B@2
Which entry shall you utilize at this point? The heart suit offers a finesse, too—in fact, a double finesse (against King and Jack).|PG||NT|^B@2
However, by taking the heart finesse now, you run a risk of losing the lead and being obliged to postpone leading trumps until still later. The club King looks like the logical entry card to use at this juncture.|PG||NT|^B@2
But (every good player, remember, goes through a mental process similar to this on every hand he plays), giving second thought to the use of the club King, you note that as soon as it is gone you will have left only one controlling card in that suit. Then if the spade finesse loses and the Opponents lead another club pronto, you will be forced to win with your Ace, while still holding a club that is sure to lose.|PG||NT|^B@2
If you put off relinquishing your control of the club suit, however, you may be able, eventually, to discard that losing club on the extra heart in Dummy's hand (you hold seven hearts against the Opponents' six).|PG||NT|^B@2
After considering every angle, then, you decide to take the heart finesse at once. |PG||at| You therefore lead a low heart from your hand and finesse the Ten from Dummy.|PG||pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hT|pg||at| East wins with the King|pc|hK|PG||AT| and returns a club.|PG||pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|c7|at|
You can win this in either hand, but you decide to let the trick run around to Dummy's King, as you feel that leading trumps has been put off long enough. |PG||pc|cK|pg||NT|^B@2
You must choose which of Dummy's trumps to lead.|pg||lb|*CWhich card would you play from Dummy if you were the Declarer? The quiz is not part of the book.^^sj^sj73|AT| Not a low one, certainly, because, if you win in your own hand with either the Ten or the Queen, you will be obliged to do some squirming to find your way into the Dummy again, You must try to keep the lead in the Dummy in order to facilitate a second trump lead through East, who may not play the King on the first round.|PG||NT|^B@2
Therefore you lead the Jack,|pc|sJ|PG||AT| on which East plays low,|pc|s2|PG||AT| you play low from your hand,|pc|s8|pc|s5|PG||AT| and West also plays low.

Your count tells you that the King is now the only trump outstanding, so you drop it by leading your Ace.|pc|sA|PG||pc|c3|pc|s7|pc|sK|pg||sk||at| The rest of this hand is pie. The King of hearts is gone, leaving Dummy's Ace-Queen high. You lead these two rounds of hearts, dropping all the outstanding cards of this suit, throwing off your losing club on Dummy's four of hearts. You thus make the 10 tricks called for by your contract of four spades.|PG||

^B@2This hand contained three sharp points of interest. |PG||NT|
^B@2The first was |CP|8|AT| - the postponement of leading trumps in order to get into the opposite hand to finesse the suit.|PG||CP||aT|
The second was |CP|8|AT| - the preference given to the heart suit for purposes of entry into the Dummy, so as not to relinquish control of a side suit (clubs).|PG||CP||AT|

{     Summary    }
^-|CS||CP||fp||AT|^B@2^Y@3T|FP||AT|he principal lesson taught by this Chapter has been |CP|8|AT|to lead trumps as quickly as possible unless some excellent reason exists for doing otherwise.|CP||FP||AT| All sorts  of dire fates have been predicted for the Bridge player who puts off leading trumps—for no good reason until the adverse trumps come romping boisterously in to break up his peace of mind at just the wrong moments. |PG||CP|8|AT|

^-The rule to lead trumps—or to think about leading trumps 
until it is crystal clear that the lead should be  postponed 
is far and away the most important of all in suit play. 
^-|PG||CP||AT|
It is the good Bridge player's automatic impulse for self-preservation. He thinks first, in playing a suit contract, of the moment when he should lead trumps; always in the back of his mind, until every adverse trump has been played, is the prodding insistence of the thought:|PG||cp|4|CS|1|FP|2|AT|
^-
{          "Now shall I lead trumps? If not, why not?"          }
^-|PG||fp||CP||cs||AT|
In fact, at a suit contract, the first suit the Declarer should try to establish is almost always the trump suit. As a corollary to the drawing of the Opponents' trumps in the process of establishing your own trumps, whenever but one trump is left outstanding, almost always capture it if it is lower than your highest trump (even if it costs two of your trumps), but let it alone if it is higher than any of your remaining trumps.|PG||AT|

There are times when you should not lead trumps at the very first chance, though it is still true that you should lead them as soon as the time is ripe. Just bear in the front of your mind the constant checking thought: put off leading trumps, even for 1 trick, only when you have a good and sufficient reason for doing so—that is, only when you gain some advantage to compensate for the risk you run by letting the Opponents hold onto their trumps for any longer than you can help.|PG||AT|

^-|CS||CP||fp||AT|^B@2^Y@3I|FP||AT| have  two notes on the material in this chapter. |pg||FP||cp|8|at|
^B@2^Y@3A. |FP||cp||at|I support Watson's statement that drawing trumps as soon as possible is important, because you do not want to let the defenders trump your winners with their low trumps. So, your first order of business when planning out the play of a hand is to decide if you can draw trumps immediately. You should do so, unless there is a good reason not to. However, on more hands than not, drawing trumps (or at least drawing all of the opponents trump), must be delayed. Here are the most common reasons:|PG||AT|

1) The most common reason to not draw trumps is that you need to use some of dummy's trumps to ruff out losers. If you draw all the opponents' trumps, dummy might not have any trump cards left to ruff out those losers. In that case, you need to exhaust the short suit in dummy first, before drawing trumps.|PG||AT|

2) The opponents can make you exhaust all your trumps before you establish your side suit winners. This is known as "losing control." If the opponents are  able to exhaust you of all of your trumps, should they get back in the lead you will be  effectively playing a no trump contract at that point. The opponents can cash the little cards in their long side suits, because you are no longer able to trump them. Although this can occur on any hand, the most common time this occurs is when you have 4 trumps in each hand. |PG||NT||

^-|CS||CP||fp||AT|^B@2^Y@3I|FP||AT|t takes at least 3 rounds to draw all of the opponents' trump (since the best you can hope for is a 3-2 split). If you have already ruffed a loser in one of the hands, you will only have one remaining trump after drawing trumps (since the hand in which you ruffed now only has 3 trumps remaining). Therefore, if you have to lose the lead  after drawing trumps, the opponents might be able to make you ruff with your only remaining trump. If you then lose the lead again, you will have no more trump left to protect against small cards that have been established in the opponents long suits. To remedy this situation, you might have to knock out the opponents' high cards in a suit before drawing trumps.|PG||AT|

By the way, this illustrates an important point about choice of contracts. In general, it is better to play in a 4-4 fit than a 5-3 fit. This is because you can use the 5 card suit to pitch losers from the other hand, and trump those losers. However, if you are in danger of losing control, then the presence of a 5th trump in one hand gives you an extra measure of protection. This should be given serious consideration when choosing your contract, particularly if you have a singleton or void in a side suit; in that case, having a long trump suit can be crucial in preventing you from losing control.|PG||AT|

3) You need the trump suit for entries to play other suits appropriately.|PG||NT||

^-|CS||CP||fp||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3B.|FP||cp||AT| My second note is about counting out the trump suit:|PG||AT|

Many players have trouble remembering if all trumps have been drawn. Here are two tips that can be used to help you:|PG||AT|

1) Rather than counting out how many trumps have been played, just remember how many trumps remain in the opponents' hands. Thus, if you have an 8 card fit, the opponents start out with 5 trumps between their 2 hands. If you draw one round, and both opponents follow, you now only need to remember there are only 3 trumps remaining in the two hands. If you then draw another round, and both opponents follow again, you now only need to remember there is just one outstanding trump remaining.|PG||AT|

2) Don't forget to deduct one trump from the remaining count if the opponents ruff one of your tricks. This is a very common error that I see over and over again, even by very good players. For example, if you have an eight card fit, and the opponents have ruffed a trick, there are now only 4 trumps remaining. Had they not ruffed, it would take at least 3 rounds to draw all the trumps. However, once they ruff, you often can draw the remaining trump in two rounds.|PG||LF|CH-13-P-1.LIN|
