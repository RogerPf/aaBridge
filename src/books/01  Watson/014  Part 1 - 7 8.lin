qx|7B01, Establishing a Suit at No-trump - Part I|
nt||HT|e|at|^b@2^z@3The preceding pages (in the book) have taught you how to treat various card combinations in a suit in order to obtain the greatest possible number of tricks from each combination. The next step is for you to learn how to discriminate—how to choose between the different suit holdings which exist in your hand. You must learn how and why one suit is selected for development rather than another.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

We shall continue to assume that every hand is played at a no-trump contract, mainly because most principles we shall take up are common to both no-trump and suit play. The special aspects peculiar to suit play will be taken up later. By the time the principles of no-trump play are mastered, the peculiarities of suit play will be very easy to comprehend.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|

The characteristic feature of no-trump play is that all suits are of equal rank in trick-taking power, so that, as a consequence, high cards lord it over the others. However, even high cards become helpless when one side is winning tricks by leading out a series of established winners in low cards. The high cards will probably win tricks eventually, but they should frequently be made to play a wholly secondary role for the time being.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|

We have already emphasized that the chief object of the Declarer at a no-trump contract is to win as many tricks as he can. Now it is true of his hand that the high cards he holds will generally take care of themselves, and are almost certain to take tricks some time. The low cards, however, are not sure winners. They require |cp|8|FP|2|at|development |cp||FP||at|and |cp|8|FP|2|at|establishment|cp||FP||at|, and to develop and establish low cards is impossible without some definite ^*Iplan of play^*N.|

Though high cards must be led or played at some stage of the game, in order to cash in the tricks they represent, they should always be led or played with some purpose in the player's mind. |cp|8|at|Many beginners (and, no matter how much they play, many persons never pass beyond the beginner stage) think they must take all their tricks as quickly as possible. They suffer under the delusion that if they do not cash in their high cards immediately, they will lose them.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


cp||at|

What is the result of this foolhardy mode of play? The result is that after the Declarer has taken all his high-card tricks, the Opponents swoop down like hungry birds of prey and snap up the remaining tricks with the lowly sevens and eights which the Declarer so generously established for them.  |
PG| ***** 9 ***** |

Contrary to the beginner's notion, it is not necessarily disastrous to lose the lead by letting an Opponent take a trick. In fact, it is often advisable. Remember that the most advantageous position for you, if you are holding certain tenaces, is for your left-hand Opponent to lead. However, |CP|8|AT|you should never give up the lead to an Opponent unless you know why you are doing it, and have a good reason for so doing. |CP||AT|If you concede a trick to one of the Opponents' honors, you should be planning to take tricks later with some lower cards which cannot be utilized until they are established. Any sacrifice of tricks must be made to secure the promotion of lower cards to positions of importance. The following deal is a simple example: |

Normally, however, as soon as the opening lead is made, you should stop for a few moments ^*Ito study the hand and mentally explore its possibilities^*N.|

If you are watching each trick like a hawk (as you should, no matter how simple the play may seem to be), you will notice that every player follows suit on the three rounds of spades, three rounds of hearts, and three rounds of diamonds. That leaves one card outstanding in each of these suits. |
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As you can see in the example, since the hands are all exposed, |SK||AT|West is left with the Jack of spades, the nine of hearts, and the Ace and deuce of clubs. You know that a diamond is also outstanding (the Jack), and you can see in the diagram that this is held by East. |
PG| ***** 34 ***** |

Now suppose that you lead your club Queen to force out the Ace. |

NT|^B@2
West wins the trick and what happens? Do you think he will lead back clubs to you so that you can cash in those last 3 club tricks?|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


AT| Not by a long shot—if West is a player who knows how to count. He will know that he has 2 other tricks: the Jack of spades and the nine of hearts. By leading these two cards (which you have established for him), he will set your Small Slam contract by 2 tricks. |

PG| ***** 45 ***** |


AT| without a moment's thought for the future, you have established 2 long-suit tricks for the Opponents. (You have actually established 3 long-suit tricks, but East cannot cash his in because he has no entry.)|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


AT| The situation would be even worse for you if West held the Ace of clubs singleton, and had one more diamond, for he would then hold the fourth diamond also, to cash in against you if you play as first planned.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It is easy enough to see where the mistake was made. In your partnership hands you had originally only six spades,|HC|sakqt54|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


AT| six hearts,|HC|hakq632|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


AT| and six diamonds.|HC|dakq852|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


at|

In other words, even if the adverse cards of these suits are divided as evenly as possible between the Opponents, four in one hand and three in the other, the immediate play of the three rounds by you will automatically establish at least one card in each suit for the Opponents.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


lc|sakqt54hakq632dakq852|NT|^B@2
Therefore, to cash in your high-card tricks immediately is lacking in purpose, for it accomplishes nothing for your side. It helps the Opponents, not you. It cannot possibly help you, no matter how the Opponents' cards are distributed. Nor can the postponement of cashing in these tricks cause you to lose any of them.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


LC|SAKQHAKQDAKQ|NT|^B@2
What, then, should your plan of play be?|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


AT| You should endeavor to establish your clubs at once. In the example given, this is very easy. You simply lead the King of clubs, sacrificing it to West's Ace at the second trick. (If West holds up his Ace, you win the trick, and lead another club to your Queen.) |

^B@2^*B*^*N|CP||AT| When the remaining tricks unquestionably belong to the Declarer (or to any other player), that player may lay down his cards and claim the rest of the tricks, indicating any particular mode of play if such is necessary for him to secure the tricks he claims. This procedure of claiming obvious tricks is commonly followed by all good players in order to save time which would be consumed in actually playing the hand out without any benefit (in pleasure and experience) to either side. |
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT|
^B@2^*IThat is, no good player considers it "fun" to lead out and haul in tricks that belong to him as surely as the nose on his face. The beginner should be warned, however, not to claim the rest of the tricks in this fashion unless he is sure they belong to him no matter how the Opponents may play. The correct procedure for claiming tricks and for penalizing a player who falsely claims the rest is covered in the Laws of Contract Bridge, October 1, 1948.

cp||fp||at|This latter admonition is a modification of the earlier principle of not giving up control of any suit without an excellent reason for so doing. The Opponents may also be establishing their suits at the same time. It is extremely important to watch every card that is played to every trick.

Your mental calculation might go something as follows:|

"^*BLet's see now. Spades have gone around twice. I still hold two spades, and the Dummy has one.

One Opponent may have both of them, or each Opponent may have one.^*N" |
PG| ***** 67 ***** |

A mental calculation similar to this should be gone through for each suit during the play of every deal. You should always know how many cards of each suit, and, if possible, their denominations, remain unplayed at any point in the game. |

NT|^B@2
Having won the first trick with the King of spades, you might then proceed to cash in those 4 heart tricks, which, with another spade trick, and 2 club tricks, will make 8 tricks.

PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Indeed, it would be insane, as events will prove. You have the four top honors in hearts and control of every other suit eventually; there is, therefore, no reason for being precipitate in hearts. You can cash in those heart tricks whenever it suits you to do so.|

Don't you think, then, that it might not be a bad idea to get rid of that diamond Ace first of all?

The proper playing plan, therefore, is to lead the Ten of diamonds to the second trick, playing the five from Dummy. (Or the four could be led from your hand, and the eight played from Dummy.)|

In both suits you have a solid sequence with only the Ace missing. However, you have nine hearts and only seven spades. By driving out the Ace of hearts first, you establish 5 tricks, whereas, by driving out the Ace of spades first, you establish only 4 tricks. Clearly you should proceed first with what yields the larger profit, namely, establishing the 5 heart tricks.|

If you drive out the diamond Ace, you will be able to take 3 diamond tricks, but if you drive out the club Ace, you will be able to take 4 club tricks.

You cannot hope to take more than 3 heart tricks because you have only six hearts against the seven held by the Opponents, so that it is quite likely that one Opponent will have a winning heart set up after you have taken the first three rounds. |

PG| ***** 172 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You know by this time that your solid high cards will win at any time. There is no reason for you to cash in your 3 spade tricks, 3 heart tricks, and 3 diamond tricks right away. Your first objective must be to attack the suit in which you have to drive out opposing higher cards. It is true that your potential winners in diamonds number 4, which is 1 more than you can ever expect to win in clubs.|HC|DAKQ|
PG| ***** 173 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, you are sure of 3 of those diamond tricks no matter what happens. The 3 club tricks are merely possibilities until the Ace and King are played. Therefore, after considering everything, you are going to try to develop 3 club tricks first, instead of the 1 long-suit trick in diamonds. Though at first glance it seems that the diamond suit is more profitable, actually the club suit is the best bet. By trying clubs first, you may gain 3 tricks, and you can lose 1 diamond.|

In other words, West would be presented with an established diamond trick which he would cash in the moment you led a club. By developing clubs first you made 11 tricks.

In choosing between establishing a suit in which you hold the top cards but wish to promote some lower card, and establishing a suit in which the Opponents hold the top cards but you have the long cards, the latter is generally the best hope. A 4th long-suit trick depending on twelve cards falling on the first three rounds of a suit—depending, that is, on a 4-3-3-3 distribution of the suit—is a possibility which can be tried any time.|LC|sakqhakqdakqcjt7|

This matter, of time may be reduced to units. Every lead is a time unit, for the lead gives a player the chance to lead the suit he wishes to establish. The right to lead may be called an ^*Ioffensive^*N unit (attacking unit). Every high card held is also a factor, for it represents one more obstacle which the adversary must overcome in trying to establish the suit. A controlling high card may be called a ^*Idefensive^*N time unit. West was one offensive unit ahead of the Declarer, in the example just given, for he had the first or opening lead. But against this the Declarer held one additional defensive unit—the third controlling spade. |

AT| The finesse of the Ten is better, for by finessing the Ten first you have a chance of making all 5 diamond tricks.|
PG| ***** 260 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You also have a chance of forcing the King immediately which leaves only the Jack out against you. To finesse the Queen first gains nothing and costs you all hope of making 5 diamond tricks.|
PG| ***** 261 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The number of diamonds you hold makes a difference, though. When you have eight diamonds against the Opponents' five, to finesse the Ten first is the best play. But if you are lucky enough to hold nine diamonds against the Opponents' four, you must bear in mind that there is an excellent chance that those four adverse diamonds will be evenly divided, two in West's hand and two in East's.|
PG| ***** 262 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In this situation, the better play is to finesse the Queen first (hoping West has the King), following it with the Ace (hoping to drop the last two diamonds).|

It is apparent that your only hope of more tricks lies in the diamond suit. Also, to make these diamond tricks, you must lead from the Dummy. Since the first trick, which you won with the heart Queen, places the lead in your hand, you must enter the Dummy. To do this you lead a low club to Dummy's Ace-King, winning with the King. |

Notice that you cannot follow this up by taking your Ace of clubs at once, for you need that Ace as a second entry. You therefore lead a low diamond, and, when East plays low, you finesse the nine-spot. |

As you should remember in connection with finessing, you are not hoping that the nine will win. You are hoping that East holds the Queen and West the Ace, and that the nine will drive out the Ace. If West wins the nine with his Ace, your King is established, and something more|pc|da|

CP||fp||at|^b@2^Y@3Y|FP||CP||AT|ou have added to your knowledge of the technique of establishing suits that it is better to seek to gain long-suit tricks by driving out high cards held by the Opponents, or by capturing such high cards by a finessing maneuver, than to hope for the development of long-suit tricks by dropping outstanding cards on the successive leads of your own high honors. This is true, of course, only when you have a choice. When there is no choice, you must make the best of whatever you have to work with.|

In successfully handling the time element, you have found that offensive and defensive units are invaluable. Whichever player has the advantage in these units will win the race for suit establishment, provided he makes the most of his holdings. When you are not crowded for time, you do not need to be afraid to lose the lead by letting an Opponent win tricks which are his anyway, sooner or later. But when an Opponent, on obtaining the lead, may be able to cash in enough established tricks to defeat your contract, try to keep the lead while doing the best you can with what ever winners you have left.|

Howard: |CP||FP||AT|Let us start with the following 8 card suit. You have AQ10x in dummy and xxxx in your hand. More often than not, you should be able to take at least 3 tricks in the suit. Let us look at some examples.|

PG| ***** 289 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You do that by leading low from your hand and playing the 10. |SK|S|PC|s2|PC|s8|SK|N|PC|st|PC|sj|
PG| ***** 290 ***** |

If it loses to the Jack, |SK||at|you eventually return to your hand and lead low to the Q. If that wins, and both opponents follow, playing the Ace will drop the king, and your low card will be good. Basically, you will win 3 tricks any time the suit is divided 3-2 and your left hand opponent has at least one honor.|
PG| ***** 291 ***** |


nT|^B@2
Now let us change the suit slightly and give you a 9 card suit, AQ10xx in dummy and xxxx in your hand. |

PG| ***** 293 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The big difference with the 9 card suit is the opponents only have 4 against you rather than 5. That means there is a significant chance that one of your opponents holds a singleton honor. If you want to maximize your chances of winning at least 4 tricks in this suit, your play is much different than with the 8 card suit. In this case, you cash the Ace first, hoping that one of your opponents has a singleton honor.|

If that is the case, you knock out the other honor and will take the other 4 tricks. |

NT|^B@2
you return to your hand and lead low towards the Q10. If your left hand opponent follows, it must be with either the King or Jack (since those are the only remaining cards out). If your left hand opponent follows with the king, obviously you play low; when you get the lead back, the Q will knock out the J. If your left hand opponent plays the J, you cover with the Q. Either that will win, or lose to the King. In either case, you end up losing only one trick. |
PG| ***** 301 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you are very lucky, cashing the Ace first will result in 5 tricks. Say your right hand opponent drops the king under the Ace. You then return to your hand, and lead low towards the Q10, finessing the 10 if your left hand opponent plays low.|
PG| ***** 302 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The same technique applies when you are missing the K and Q. Say you have an eight card fit, with AJ10x in dummy and xxxx in your hand. |
PG| ***** 303 ***** |


QX||ST||sk|s|rh||ah|Board  H4|sv|0|sk||md|1s2346,Sk9,SAjT5,Sq87|ha|Y|NT|^B@2
The best way to establish 2 tricks is to lead low towards the AJ10 and play the 10. Most of the time that will lose to an honor. When you get the lead back, you now lead low towards the AJ and play the J. You will take three tricks any time the suit divides 3-2 and your left hand opponent has at least one of the missing honors. However, with a nine card fit, the play is different. |
PG| ***** 304 ***** |


QX||ST||sk|s|rh||ah|Board  H5|sv|0|sk||md|1s2346,Sq97,SAjT85,Sk|ha|Y|NT|^B@2
In this example, you have AJ10xx opposite xxxx. Now, you should cash the Ace first, hoping for a singleton honor. If that is the case, the J will drive out the other honor, and you will take 4 tricks. If a singleton honor does not drop, you play another round of the suit and hope for a 2-2 break. So, the only time you will not take 4 tricks in that suit is when one of the opponents holds the KQ and another card, which is of fairly low probability.
