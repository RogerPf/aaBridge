^B@2^Y@3All the knowledge of cards in the world, and even the highly perfect ability to count accurately, will not necessarily make you a great Bridge player. If you know all the principles of sound play, and even all of the involved situations which require special treatment, you cannot rise to the heights until you have learned how to ^*Ideceive^*N. This necessity for deception—of one’s adversaries, of course, and not of one’s Partner (except when it cannot be helped)—has led to the many analogies drawn between Bridge and warfare. Camouflage, the masking of batteries, the bluff show of strength not possessed, the feint attacks, the ambushes, the covered retreats, the drawing of the enemy’s fire, all are forms of deception used in military strategy. They do not all have exact counterparts in Contract Bridge strategy. but deceptive tactics certainly have their vital place.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |

Deception in the bidding has been widely publicized as “psychic" bidding. When bluff bids were first introduced, they were extremely effective because no one knew quite how to cope with them. They were like the first use of poison gas in warfare, because they came without warning. Also like poison gas, they might be blown back against their maker by an adverse breeze caused by Partner’s confusion, and this was both their drawback and their fascination. To make a bluff bid has the allure of trying to run unscathed through a rain of bullets. However, everyone is now on the alert for a psychic bid, and much of the effectiveness of such bidding tactics has been lost, while a great deal of their danger remains. Many players, thinking they are being cleverly deceptive, make what are only suicidal bids, deceiving everybody at the table, including themselves. |
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|

Even if bluff and surprise bids go entirely by the board, however, there is still plenty of room for deception in the play of the hand. Deceptive and startling plays are quite as effective as deceptive and startling bids, and very often more so, while they usually lack the dire consequences of a bluff bid unwisely made. Such deceptive plays may take the form of a high card unnecessarily thrown off, a discard made at a time when it will greatly confuse an Opponent, a trick refused for a reason the Opponent can only guess, or a trump played when it apparently sacrifices a trick. Such plays often succeed in implanting incorrect impressions in the minds of those you are striving to defeat. |

^B@2^Y@3Lack of imagination is to be deplored in any activity, but it is particularly pathetic in Bridge playing. A player who lacks imagination can only be described as wooden; he plays like an automaton, and can be relied upon with as much confidence as a chemist can be sure of a chemical reaction under any given conditions. Such woodenness makes the player’s moves an open book to his Opponents, and he becomes easy prey. And it is just as wooden to make unnatural plays often, as it is never to make them at all. Certainly it is just as harmful to gain a reputation for always false-carding, as it is to be ticketed as a player who never false-cards. If a deceptive play is injected when it is least expected, however, it may become the means of making a contract or the means of defeating an apparently unbeatable hand. In this Chapter are presented a number of deceptive plays and maneuvers:

^-{    False-Carding    }
^-|
cp||at|^B@2^Y@3^*IFalse-carding^*N is simply the play of a card which is the unnatural one for the player to select under the circumstances. False-carding by the Defending Side is much more risky and consequently much less common than false-carding by the Declarer. The reason for this should be obvious. The Declarer’s Partner is the Dummy in name and in fact. Any deceptive play made by the Declarer can deceive only his Opponents. But a deceptive play made by an Opponent of the Declarer, and designed to deceive the Declarer, may also deceive that player’s Partner.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


AT|

Consequently a player on the Defending Side has to weigh the possible result of misleading his Partner as well as the Declarer. A defending player should, as a matter of fact, confine his deceptive plays to those times when it makes no difference whether his Partner is deceived or not. |
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


AT|

As a general thing, the trump suit offers the most frequent means for a defending player to fool the Declarer, both because this suit is usually the one that is disposed of first and also because Partner’s reactions are not of any great importance. Take, for example, the following deal:|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |

pg| ***** 9 ***** |


sk|W|MD|0,SQJHAQ764DK75C863,0,S32HT98D862CQJT94|AT| With his high-card strength, West knows that his Partner probably does not have even a single trick. If West is very lucky, he may take 3 tricks himself, with his Ace-Queen of hearts and his King of diamonds, but this will not defeat the contract.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |

A fourth trick must be found somewhere if the Declarer is to be stopped from making the game.|

PG| ***** 13 ***** |


AT| The most strategic opening lead, therefore, appears to be the Jack of spades! According to the conventions of leads in general use, the Jack denies possession of the Queen, and this false lead,|SK|W|AT| therefore, may induce the Declarer to place the Queen in the East hand.|MD|0,0,0,S32HT98D862CQJT94|

PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||at|
No one would be so fatuous as to claim that such a play as this will always prove effective. At least it does create a situation which makes the Declarer do some thinking. This situation would never come about if West, on this deal, made his normal opening lead of a club. Without this unusual lead, South is almost certain to lead out the Ace and King of spades and play for the drop.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||at|
The false lead, in other words, creates an element of doubt in the Declarer’s mind which may or may not work out to West’s advantage. Incidentally, it makes no difference whether East regards the lead of the Jack of trumps as honest or not.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||at|
It is also apparent why false-carding should be used only now and then. If West should open the Jack of trumps every time he happens to hold the Queen-Jack doubleton, the Declarer would soon catch on to this tendency and not be fooled. If, however, West has never made such an opening lead before to the Declarer’s knowledge, the chances are pretty good that the Declarer will take the lead at its face value and be fatally misled.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||at|
Sometimes the false-carding may have the tactics of double-crossing. If the Declarer has been led to believe that West is in the habit of leading the Jack of trumps from Queen-Jack doubleton, the sudden shift to the lead of the Queen from the same combination may fool the Declarer. |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


AT|

The effectiveness of the ruse depends entirely on the unexpectedness of it, and that depends, in turn, on the imagination and cleverness of the player making use of the trick.|

PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||AT|
There might be a chance in the one other suit—clubs. At this point, West would certainly shift to a club, whereupon he and his Partner would have taken 4 club tricks without opposition, setting Mr. Culbertson’s contract. The Declarer saw all this coming, and did his best to keep West from shifting suits. The success of his false-carding strategy was well deserved.|

East should now play the Ten, not the deuce. The Ten is bound to start a train of thought in the Declarer’s mind. Having previously made up his mind to take the second round finesse, he may change and decide that East’s other club is the Queen.|

If it should turn out that Declarer had held the Queen (from East’s point of view, that is), East need not worry, for no harm has been done by his play of the Ten. Of course, if this play is made every time the opportunity presents itself, the adversaries will eventually "catch on" and fail to take the play of the Ten at all seriously.|

AT| This almost certainly places the Ten in the West hand—so far as the Declarer is concerned. South will then probably return to his own hand in order to finesse the nine-spot on the second round.

UP|4|NT||at|
Of course, it is true that, in this example, the Declarer might have taken the finesse even if the Ten had been played, but the Queen makes it almost a certainty that he will do so. It is also true that the play should not be made ^*Uunless East is certain of distribution of the suit^*N, as it might turn out to be disastrous if the Declarer happens to hold three clubs instead of two. All of these features should be carefully weighed before the play is made.|

CS||CP||AT|^B@2^Y@3When the opening lead is a King, many players find the temptation to false-card very great. Sometimes they false-card whether the situation really calls for it or not.

In such cases it is sometimes possible to play in such a fashion that the Opponents may not appreciate each other’s strength quickly enough and may allow the necessary extra trick or tricks to be sneaked through in time. For example:|

Of course, East probably should go up with the Ace and lead spades, but—would everyone? It is true that the Declarer might go down 5 tricks if West held the Ace of hearts. However, not vulnerable and not doubled, the play is worth while, as long as the loss risked is not too great. The play is not recommended if a set of 1000 points, or even 500 points, is threatened. |

But if the Declarer can be made to guess at the start, before he has quite got his bearings, he may be defeated by a ruse. Such a ruse is available to West in hearts.

Of course, this play may not work. That is quite true. But it will certainly make the Declarer catch his breath in momentary alarm. He may decide that the eight of hearts is a singleton, and may then go up with Dummy’s Ace immediately, deciding to rely entirely on the trump finesse. Of course, he may not be particularly frightened at all, but may simply play low, finessing without thinking. But West can lose nothing by making the lead, and it has a good chance of robbing the Declarer of his Slam. |

CS||cp||AT|^B@2^Y@3Many, many pages could be written on the subject of leading against Slams. Much depends on a most careful analysis of the bidding by the opening leader in conjunction with his own holding. Fortunately for the Defender’s cause, Slams are usually reached after quite a few bidding rounds of cautious probing; rarely do we encounter the slam-bang “one spade, six spades" style. Because of this fact, a lengthy discussion of leads against Slams might better be included in a book on bidding. In any event, for that reason and for space considerations, we will merely touch the highlights.|

2. At most ^*Isuit Slam^*N contracts, you have to strike quickly, as Dummy usually has a long suit which can be set up for discards. It is your aim to set up immediately one side suit trick as the setting trick in case, as you hope, you or your Partner can get a first trick in either trumps or Dummy’s or Declarer’s side suit. Thus a lead from a King or Queen of an unbid suit or a suit bid secondarily by Dummy is often desirable. The shorter the suit the better. Attacking from two or three or four to the King or Queen is more likely to be productive than from five or more. We’re looking for a ^*Isecond^*N round winner since Declarer is most likely to be able to handle the third round of any side suit by ruffing or otherwise.|

CS||cp||AT|^B@2^Y@3The double of a Slam bid, like any other double, is never made on sheer speculation. But since the occasion rarely arises against good opposition that a Defender has the "stuff" in his own hand to soundly browbeat a voluntarily reached Slam contract, the double of a Slam has come to have a special meaning. When the Partner of the opening leader doubles a Slam contract he is asking the leader to make an unusual lead. (When the opening leader himself doubles, that’s his business.)|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


at|

If the doubler has bid a suit, the one fairly clear-cut message conveyed is that the leader should not lead that suit. One Slam doubling convention known as the Four Aces Slam Double insisted that the double calls specifically for Dummy’s ^*Bfirst^*N bid suit. (Since this almost invariably is an honest, good suit, such a lead is obviously unusual.)|
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


at|

The more prevalent convention, originally called the Lightner Slam Double does not definitely specify Dummy’s first suit. The Lightner Double can be that, but very frequently can be showing a void suit and asking for that lead. And occasionally it may be smoking out a "phony" second suit shown by Declarer. How is the opening leader to tell? Again, one must |cp|8|at|“review the bidding carefully and look for a clue"|cp||at| in conjunction with a careful study of one’s hand. We will give one example, without the entire deal, of such a double and the leader’s hand. The more general Lightner Double is being used. Here is how the bidding went:|

As West, on lead against six spades, you hold the hand above. With this hand, after Partner doubles you may think fleetingly of Dummy’s first bid suit, diamonds. But because of Dummy’s diamond rebid, and your own King and your own shortness in the suit, Partner is not very likely to have the holding to wish a lead there.|
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


NT||at|
Partner must be doubling on a void suit elsewhere (plus the certainty or at least good hope of a trick somewhere else). Based on your length that void should be in clubs. So you forego your natural lead, the Jack from that nice heart sequence, and lead some low club. Most of the time though, the desired lead, even under the Lightner convention, turns out to be Dummy’s first suit. So in the long run there is little difference in effect between the two conventions. But the more rigid Four Aces convention would lose out in situations like the example given [here].|

He made his opening lead, therefore, on the assumption that the Dummy did contain the singleton Queen.

{     Summary    }
^-|CS||CP||AT|^B@2^Y@3 The art of deception in Contract Bridge play is simply to lead or play a card which tells your adversary a story quite different from your actual holding. You must always bear in mind that, when playing defensively, you are likely to mislead your Partner as well as the Declarer, and almost never make a deceptive play when it may plunge your Partner into trouble.|

Let it be said here, lest some reader misunderstand, that this form of deception is entirely ethical—for the simple reason that it ^*Bdoes^*N mislead Partner as well as the Declarer. Any player may play any card he wishes, just so long as he follows suit when able. If he sees fit to depart from the usual or expected play, and makes an unusual or “false" play, that is his privilege. If his Opponent falls for the ruse, he cannot always be blamed, but the player who practiced the deception may well receive proper credit for his perspicacity in seeing the chance and his initiative in taking it. |
