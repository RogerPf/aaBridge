^B@2Throughout the pages of this book it has been emphasized that a knowledge of the fundamentals of play is not enough to make you a good card player. Even if you know the proper treatment which even the rarer situations require, you will still not make all the contracts that you should make, unless you learn to take advantage of every little bit of information which falls your way. |
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

All hands involve a certain amount of competitive bidding, all of which is informative in some degree,|cp|8|fp|2|at|^*B *^*N|cp||fp||at| and if you become the Declarer, you have at least some knowledge of the distribution of the Opponents' hands, however vague it may be. You may know only that one Opponent holds a five-card suit, or something resembling it, but even this sparse information should be noted mentally.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


cp|8|fp|2|at|

^B@2*|cp||fp||at|^*I "Curiously enough, some of the earlier bidding conventions were described as "informative" when they were intended primarily for conveying information to Partner, such as the informative double, though any bid whatever, or any call, including a Pass, must by its very nature be informative. The fact that a player passes instead of making a bid, or that he doubles (whether for a penalty or to be taken out by Partner), is certainly indicative in some degree of the sort of hand he has—or thinks he has."^*N —Sam Fry, Jr.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|

^B@2In addition to information gleaned from the bidding, there is the story told by the opening lead, and the cards immediately located when the Dummy's hand is exposed. Every player at the table knows the whereabouts of twenty-six cards—his own hand and the Dummy's. As soon as the opening lead is made, the Declarer and leader's Partner know the location of twenty-seven cards, and they have some glimmering of the probable location of certain other cards. |
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|

By studying the Dummy and the opening lead in connection with his own hand, the Declarer and leader's Partner can figure out pretty well what the lead means. If it happens to be a Queen, and if the Jack of the same suit is not among the twenty-seven visible cards, the leader is almost certainly marked with the Jack. The conventions governing opening leads, as given in an earlier Chapter (in Part I), enable the other two players to deduce a fair amount of information from the denomination of the card led to start the play.|

^B@2T|FP||AT|hen it is of the greatest value to watch each card that falls on every trick. Every card, no matter how seemingly insignificant its denomination, tells a story all its own. You may think that it does not matter when some player drops the deuce on your lead. It does matter. It may be a discouraging signal to his Partner and may even show his willingness to stand some other lead his Partner is bound to make later. Even if it has no particular meaning, a mental reservation of possible future importance should be made.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


AT|

You begin your counting by noting mentally the number of certain winners you hold, or the number of certain and probable losers. Thus you get immediately some notion, when you are Declarer, of whether your contract is likely to be easy or difficult to fulfill. At any rate, you have the basis for planning a campaign—you know whether you can take your tricks and be done, or whether you must maneuver to develop a trick or two somewhere that does not manifest itself at the start. You may later change your mind, of course.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT|

But what is really meant by counting is the habit of keeping a mental tally on the number of cards of each suit that have been played as soon as each successive trick is quitted. Not only that, but the denomination of the cards that have been played, so that outstanding higher cards are known to you. A good player knows, at the tenth trick, for example, that his seven of diamonds is high, or that an Opponent still holds the eight-spot.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


AT|

Counting also means the noting of each Opponent's hand distribution, as it is revealed, first, by the bidding, and later, by the fall of the cards in the play. If you are on the Defending Side, you count the Declarer's hand and also your Partner's hand. You pounce upon each bit of information to fill in the blanks—you learn, finally, that another player held four spades originally, and that he has two hearts left, and so on. This placing of the cards in the other hands is absolutely essential to the success of such maneuvers as end plays, squeeze plays, and the like.|

^B@2C|FP||AT|ounting, in fact, is really an intrinsic part of every family of plays that exists. To execute an end play consciously and successfully—or, for that matter, to execute a squeeze, a coup, or any other play, elementary or advanced—some sort of count, something approaching a count, of the Opponents' hands is invariably essential. Because of this fact, the subject of counting has already been frequently mentioned and somewhat explained in earlier chapters, and, for this reason, the present Chapter is naturally shorter than it would otherwise be. The ability to count and the imagination to interpret the counting are indispensable to every Bridge player.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


AT|

Curiously, however, ^*Iteaching^*N would-be players to count is practically an impossibility. Since "counting" in Bridge is somewhat more than one, two, three, etc., being applied to each of the four suits and also to each of the four hands, it requires a |cp|8|at|logical mind, a great deal of patience (or what might be called dogged determination) and a certain amount of imagination|cp||at|. Without these qualities, a person can never become a great player anyway, so that it may also be said that without these qualities, a person cannot learn to count.|

cp||fp||at|
^B@2T|FP||AT|ake the following deal as an example. The Declarer should be able to tell the distribution of ^*Iall four hands^*N—almost as soon as the first trick has been played. Only by this counting of the hand can he make his contract, for to fulfill his bid he has to use a double end play. Lest the reader think this hand is a pure invention, note that this hand was actually dealt at Crockford's Club, New York City, and was played by Mr. Oswald Jacoby, one of the outstanding players of the world, who sat in the South position as the Declarer. |
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


at|

Mr. Jacoby, by brilliant analysis, is able to mark with great accuracy the adverse distribution at the end of the first trick. With the knowledge thus derived, he is able to make a series of plays—constituting a double end play—which guarantees his contract against any possible defense. Without this counting, the hand would have to be played in what might be called "ordinary" fashion, when the Declarer would almost certainly be set at least 1 trick. |

NT|^B@2
First, what did Mr. Jacoby (Declarer) learn from the bidding? With his own powerful hand, it seemed impossible that the Opponents could bid so strongly when vulnerable. Mr. Jacoby decided at once that the bidding must be based chiefly on distribution.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Take East's bid of three club—a pretty strong bid, vulnerable. Declarer's and Dummy's hands contain eight clubs. To justify his bid, East obviously requires all remaining five clubs. Even then the suit is not very strong, headed by only King-Jack-Ten. Surely he must have an escape suit to turn to if doubled. There is only one possible suit available to him for escape. It cannot be spades, for Mr. Jacoby holds Ace-Queen, and there was a spade overcall on his left. The only possible suit is diamonds.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Consequently East probably holds five diamonds besides his five clubs. |

Thus the distribution of the Opponents' cards is practically marked after the opening lead. West is almost certain to have six spades, two hearts, five diamonds, and no clubs. East must hold one spade, two hearts, five diamonds, and five clubs. With these facts in front of him, Mr. Jacoby went about making his contract as follows:|

CS||CP||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3S|FP||AT|urely the business of counting the adverse distribution now seems less mysterious. Sometimes it is comparatively easy, and sometimes rather difficult. But always in the Declarer's mind—if he is a good player—is the questing effort to find out how many cards of each suit each of his adversaries was originally dealt. When he knows that, he has won a goodly portion of his battle against the unknown. You should try to habituate yourself to count automatically—and always, no matter how simple the hand as a whole may be.|
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


AT|

The examples which follow do not introduce any more difficult instances of counting, but they do involve different methods of obtaining information. After all, as with so many accomplishments, to count well it is necessary chiefly to practice patiently and carefully. Superficial counts may be obtained on practically every hand after a few well—chosen tricks have been won or lost. The seemingly more complicated counts should then come about in the same way that skill at playing the piano finally follows suddenly upon hours of arduous drills.|
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


AT|

When counting a hand or trying to locate cards from the bidding, it is not always possible to obtain the exact adverse distribution. Certain cards can be placed rather definitely in every hand, but two or three cards will always be doubtful in most hands. In such situations, there is available a kind of play known as a percentage play. The basis of it is that there seems to be more chance of finding a specific card in one hand than in the other, and the Declarer gambles on this percentage of expectancy. It may involve playing for a drop when the finesse seems like the more natural play, or vice versa. The following deal illustrates the "vice versa." |

(Furthermore, East's return of the deuce of hearts at the fourth trick is almost certainly a fourth best). |

West has already shown up with four clubs, and therefore he holds only three cards in spades and diamonds. East must then hold six cards in spades and diamonds, which makes the chances slightly in favor of the Queen of spades being in the East hand.|SK|e|

Note that the Declarer eliminates one of West's unknown cards before he takes the finesse—this is a kind of safety play. The finesse might easily prove unsuccessful, but it offers a slightly better chance of success, when all the factors are taken into consideration than to play for the drop.|

Declarer decided at the fifth trick that he might as well continue leading clubs. He must lose 2 diamond tricks anyway, and he eliminates them early by throwing them off here. By letting West ruff the fifth trick, he gets rid of one adverse trump. In fact, there was a possibility that the Opponent who wished to win this trick might have to use a trump honor to ruff with.|

This seems like a pure guess, but actually it is not. South recalls West's vulnerable overcall of ^*Itwo diamonds^*N, and yet West, as South now knows, held only five diamonds originally. West did not have the Ace and King of spades, nor the Ace and King of clubs. But he must have had some high-card strength, and the only card he could have to justify his vulnerable overcall is the Ace of hearts. Of course, he might also hold the Queen of hearts but, if he does, nothing can be done about it.|pc|hj|pc|hA|

This deal is interesting because it shows how easy it is, in this particular situation, to locate the Ace of trumps. It is interesting also for another reason. South's diamond discards were absolutely essential, and if he had led trumps immediately he would have been defeated. If at the second trick he had gone over to the King of spades and taken the heart finesse right away, West would have won the trick with the Ace and would then have cashed in 2 diamond tricks instead of the 1 he finally made.|

^B@2With three rounds of diamonds gone, he would have led a fourth diamond, and East's Queen could have over-ruffed any trump in the Dummy, while the Declarer would have to follow suit.

Mr. Malowan began to count. His partner had opened the deuce of spades, showing that he held no more than four originally. He had also shown up with a singleton diamond, which marked him with eight cards in hearts and clubs. It seemed unlikely that either of these suits could be of five-card length, as otherwise he would have opened it rather than spades. Therefore, they were probably each of four-card length.|sk|E|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The situation was beginning to clear up. If West held four hearts, Declarer must hold a singleton, as the Dummy also held four and so did Mr. Malowan. The proper play was not even close. The Ace of hearts was laid down, felling Declarer's lone King; a small heart was led to West's Jack and the return through Dummy's Ten enabled both the Queen and nine-spot to make. The contract was thereby defeated 1 trick, while an ordinary return of Partner's suit would have permitted it to be made.|

More specific information about distribution can be obtained most of the time by close application to the bidding and by watching the cards as they fall on each trick. All the knowledge of hand patterns in the world is much less important or useful than this commonsense method of counting.|

{    Summary    }
^-|CS||CP||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3T|FP||AT|he principal thing to remember about counting is how absolutely necessary it is. It should become a habit. Any player who cannot learn to count, habitually, on every hand, can never progress very far in the game. It is not particularly difficult, so no one should become discouraged. Keep at it, trying it on every deal you play, and it will gradually become easier and easier, until it seems as natural as following suit.|
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


AT|
 
No hard-and-fast rules can be given for counting. It is always important to remember any bids the Opponents may have made. Vulnerable bids are usually especially revealing, since very few players will run any great risk with shaded bids when vulnerable—the possible penalties are too great. The bidding enables certain cards to be placed tentatively in a certain hand, and you can proceed on this basis until the fall of the cards gives you good reason to alter your first diagnosis.|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


AT|

By coordinating the adverse bids with the later fall of the cards, a great deal of insight into the Opponents' holdings can usually be obtained. As soon as one player shows out of a suit, the entire suit becomes placed, since the fourth player must have held the remainder originally. The opening lead frequently shows length, as well as something about honor strength. A player's signals to his Partner—by means of discards and echoes—also help the Declarer, though he must often be wary and not place absolute reliance upon them.|
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


AT|

The whole secret of accurate counting depends on the factor 13. There are only ^*Ithirteen^*N cards of a suit, and there are always ^*Ithirteen^*N cards in each original hand. This seems too obvious to require statement, and yet it is true that many otherwise good players fail to utilize the fact.|
