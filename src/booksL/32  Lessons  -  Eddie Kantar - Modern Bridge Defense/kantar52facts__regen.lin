at|^c@2|at|^y@3|ht|o|cp|3|at|^cWhen defending a suit contract, there are two main techniques declarer uses to garner extra tricks:|
at|^^|cp|3|at|^c(1) setting up a long suit in dummy, |
at|^^|cp|3|at|^c(2) ruffing losers in the short hand (usually the dummy.) |
at|^^|cp|3|at|^c|
at|^^|cp|3|at|^cIf dummy comes down with a long and a short suit and you have the long suit bottled up, lead trumps because the long suit is not usable. |
at|^^|cp|3|at|^c|
at|^^|cp|3|at|^cIf it appears that the long suit is usable, play an attacking defense going for outside tricks quickly. |
at|^^|cp|3|at|^c|
at|^^|cp|3|at|^cIf the dummy comes down balanced, declarer has no place to get rid of losers and will eventually lose them, therefore you and partner should adopt a passive defense. |
at|^^|cp|3|at|^c|
at|^^|cp|3|at|^cAvoid breaking new suits if possible. Let them have what they have coming. Sit back and wait for your tricks. Your day will come.|
