^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

{ Constructive bidding is defined as auctions with 
no interference by the opponents. }
^-|fp||AT|^B@2^Y@3This is the second tutorial of a five-lesson series on the Fundamentals of Constructive Bidding held by Howard Schutzman (BBO nickname "hondo717") on September 30, 2010 in the BIL. The series consists of 5 lessons:

"The purpose of these lessons is for students to learn the concepts behind constructive bidding. I have found that, although many students understand the (often complicated) rules about bidding, they do not understand the reasoning behind these rules. By learning the fundamentals rather than just the rules, a student will be able to more intuitively and comfortably bid, without being confused by the many (sometimes conflicting) rules that may or may not apply. Note that these lessons will not teach any particular system. It will simply teach the fundamentals upon which most bidding systems are built. A student should therefore be able to more comfortably play any of the popular systems."|CP||AT|

{        Constructive Auctions after a 1NT Opening Bid       }
^-|FP||at|^b@2^Y@3Constructive auctions after a 1NT opener are very straightforward. These auctions very much 
illustrate the "responder is Captain" principle which we discussed in the last lesson. As opener, you should open 1NT if at all possible. This includes opening 1NT without stoppers in some suits and with a 5-card major. 1NT is a very descriptive bid--it shows 15-17 HCP and only 3 possible hand shapes (4-4-3-2, 5-3-3-2, and 4-3-3-3). |

^-{ Responder Hand Categories }
^-|AT|^b@2^Y@3
In all of these lessons, I will assume the reader uses basic hand evaluation techniques. That is, he or she uses the standard 4-3-2-1 method for counting HCP and makes small adjustments for either shortness or length. I now teach, and prefer, the more accurate Bergen methodology, but because it is not familiar to everyone, I will not use it in these lessons.

|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


AT|As responder, hands fall into one of 3 categories--|CP|8|FP|2|AT|MINIMUM, MEDIUM, or MAXIMUM. |FP||CP||AT|The point ranges are slightly different than the ranges we discussed earlier.  The  point ranges are:|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


CP|8|FP|2|AT|

  ^cMinimum |FP||CP||AT|^f- no more than 7 points; game is not possible;|CP|8|FP|2|AT|
  ^CMedium |FP||CP||AT|^f- 8-9 points; game is possible if opener has a maximum NT (defined below);|CP|8|FP|2|AT|
  ^CMaximum |FP||CP||AT|^f- 10 or more points; you must bid game.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT|
    
When responder has a medium hand, opener is invited to bid game with maximum NT hand. A hand is considered maximum NT if it meets any of the following criteria:
^C* Any hand with 17 HCP
^C* Any hand with 16 HCP and a fit with responder's major suit
^C* Any hand with 16 HCP and a 5-card suit
^C* Any hand with 16 HCP, not 4-3-3-3 distribution, and at least two 10s or 9s.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


AT|
  
Now that you understand how to determine whether or not to bid game, the rest of the lesson will focus on how to determine whether the best contract is NT, hearts, or spades.|

{   Determining if You Should Explore for a Major Suit Fit   }
|FP||AT| 
As responder, it is easy to determine if you should explore for a major suit contract.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


AT|

If you do not hold at least four cards in either major, you should not bother to look for a
major suit fit. (On the few occasions when opener has a five-card major, you may miss a 5-3
fit, but most of the time NT will play just as well anyway.)|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


AT|

If you do not have 4 or more cards in either major suit, your choices as responder are simple.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


AT|

With a minimum hand (seven points or less), pass.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


AT|

With a medium hand, bid 2NT. Partner should bid 3NT with a maximum NT hand (described earlier).|

^-{    The Stayman Convention    }
|FP||AT|
The Stayman Convention is used to find a 4-4 major suit fit in NT auctions.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


AT|
You should only use Stayman if you have a |FP|2|CP|8|at|medium (8-9)|FP||CP||AT| or |FP|2|CP|8|at|maximum (10 or more)|FP||CP||AT| hand.
Do not bid Stayman if you have a |CP|8|AT|minimum (0 to 7 points)|CP||AT| hand. 
(The Garbage Stayman Convention is described in the Advanced Topics at the end of this tutorial. 
If you decide to play garbage Stayman, then you can bid Stayman when you are 4-4 in the majors with a minimum response.)|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


AT|

You should bid Stayman if you have a medium or maximum hand and your hand meets any of the following criteria:|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
{ You have one 4-card majors }|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |

{ You have two 4-card majors }|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |

{ You have one 4-card major and one 5-card major }|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |

The Stayman convention is initiated when the responder bids 2C.
This is a completely artificial bid that says nothing about clubs.
It is merely asking the NT opener if he has a 4 (or 5) card major.^-|

qx|B03,The Jacoby Transfer Convention|cs|2|fp|3|at|
^-{    The Jacoby Transfer Convention    }
|FP|2|cp|8|AT|Jacoby Transfers|CP||FP||AT| were devised to allow the 1NT opener to play the hand.
This is often advantageous, because it is more likely that the defense will give away a trick on  opening lead
if the strong hand (the 1NT opener) plays the last card at trick 1.
In fact, when the strong hand is concealed, you may take more than one additional trick
because the defense has to guess more.|

As responder, you should use Jacoby Transfers under the following circumstances:|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


AT|
{ If you have a 6-card or longer major (even with 4 cards in the other major), even if you have a minimum hand. } |
PG| ***** 90 ***** |

{ If you have a 5-card major and a minimum hand (even if you also have a 4-card major). }|
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


AT|
{ If you have a medium or maximum hand, a 5-card major and not precisely 4 cards in the other major
(as described earlier, you should use Stayman with a non-minimum and 5-4 in the majors). }|
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


AT|
{ Note: with 5-5 in the majors, you should use Jacoby Transfer. }|
PG| ***** 93 ***** |

{ And finally, if your hand qualifies, you should transfer even if you have very few points 
(even with 0 HCP!). It is always easier to play in a suit than in NT, particularly when responder is weak. }

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me also discuss "Texas Transfers", which is a popular but unnecessary convention. The idea behind Texas Transfers is that, if responder has a 6-card suit and a maximum hand, he knows that he wants to play game in his 6-card suit. So, playing Texas Transfers, responder can bid 4D as a transfer to 4H and 4H as a transfer to 4S. If you care to play them, there is nothing wrong with doing that, assuming your partner does not forget the convention. However, unless you differentiate between the sequence 1N-2D-2H-4H and 1N-4D-4H (and the same thing for spade transfers), there is no added value to playing Texas, as both auctions accomplish exactly the same thing.|

cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I know. Those experts who play Texas (and most do), do play that the auctions 1N-2D-2H-4H and 1N-2H-2S-4S are mild slam tries (since they can just use Texas to stop in game). But, in practice, because such an auction rarely occurs, I have found that partner never remembers that they are mild slam tries.|

{ 4-Suit Jacoby Transfers - Transfer to Minors }

The transfer to minors can be used for two purposes:|

a) to allow responder to bid 3NT with a 6-8 point hand and a 6-card minor suit.|
PG| ***** 218 ***** |

AT|^B@2^Y@3
Most partnerships play Jacoby Transfers for major suits. However, interested players may use Jacoby Transfers for the minors as well. First, let me explain the benefits of transfers in minors.|
PG| ***** 220 ***** |


AT|

In general, if you have a weak hand with a long suit opposite a strong hand, it is more desirable to play in the weak hand's suit because in that suit, the long cards will take tricks, whereas in another suit it may not be possible to score the low cards in the weak hand's long suit. The only tradeoff is you have to play at the three level, which is kind of high. However, given a weak hand with seven clubs or diamonds, the tradeoff is worth it.|
PG| ***** 221 ***** |


AT|

Some partnerships play 2S as a transfer to minors. Opener automatically responds 3C. The partner bidding the transfer passes with clubs or corrects to 3D. That is easier to play, but not quite as flexible. I recommend you start with this simpler transfer and then progress to the stronger and more flexible version which I will explain next. Let me first show you a few examples of the simple transfer to minors.|
PG| ***** 222 ***** |


AT|

BTW, all "transfer bids" (2S and 2NT) should be alerted. Further both "accepted" and "rejected" response bids by the NT opener should be alerted as these are additional information available to the partnership that opponents should be aware of. To economize his time, the Movie Maker has not included the alerts in the following examples. Please consider it in every situation.|

{ 4-Suit Jacoby Transfers - Transfer to Minors }
^-|AT|^B@2^Y@3One variant of Jacoby that I use is 4-suit Jacoby transfer. A 2@S bid by responder is a transfer to clubs, and a 2NT bid is a transfer to diamonds. Since there are two bids between the transfer bid and the transfer suit, opener now has two choices. |
PG| ***** 235 ***** |


AT|

With good support (ONLY if you have 1 of the top 3 honors, regardless of the length of your support), opener "accepts" the transfer by not bidding the suit (1NT-2@S-2NT or 1NT-2NT-3@C). BTW, Notrumper alwyas has at least 2-card minor.|
PG| ***** 236 ***** |


AT| 
With less than good support, opener "rejects" the transfer by bidding the transfer suit (1NT-2@S-3@C or 1NT-2NT-3@D). |
PG| ***** 237 ***** |


AT|

This is somewhat counter-intuitive, as one would think the more natural way would be for opener to bid the suit to "accept" the transfer. However, the reason for doing it this way is that it is more likely that opener will end up as declarer.|
PG| ***** 238 ***** |


AT|

Again, this convention can be used for two purposes:
1. To allow responder to bid 3NT with a 6-8 point hand and a 6-card minor suit if opener accepts the transfer. Otherwise, the contract will be 3 of the minor.

2. To play in 3 of a minor with 5 or fewer points and a 6-card minor.|
PG| ***** 239 ***** |


AT|

As an important clarification. If you play 4-suit Jacoby transfer you cannot make a 2NT invitational bid. In another word, 1N-P-2N is not invitational bid. In its place you bid Stayman followed by 2NT. Now we have to 1NT bidder should be alert to the following:
^C1NT-2@C-2@S-2NT does not necessarily promise hearts and simply shows a 2N invite.
^C1NT-2@C-2@H-2N denies 4 spades by responder and simply shows a 2N invite. 
^B@2If responder bids Stayman with an invitational hand and 4 spades, he must bid 2@S when opener responds 2@H (e.g. the auction should go 1N-2@C-2@H-2@S).|

{ 4-Suit Jacoby Transfers - Transfer to Minors }

^-|cs||at|^B@2^Y@3

This version of Transfer to Minors is very powerful but can be confusing because the traditional invitational 2NT bid by responder no longer is available. To make an invitational raise to 2N (since a direct 2N is a diamond transfer), you bid Stayman first and then 2N. Therefore, if responder bids Stayman, on rare occasions she will not have  a 4-card major. You should have a thorough discussion with your partner if you would like to use this version of transfer to minors.|
PG| ***** 257 ***** |


AT| 

One major benefit of this version is that the partnership  can use it to bid thin 3N games. For example, suppose your partner opens 1N and you have AQxxxx of diamonds. You might transfer to diamonds, and if partner bids 3C which shows which shows the @DK, you bid 3N since you likely have 6 diamond tricks. Let me show you an example.|

{ Should You Transfer to Minors? }

^-|HT|f|cp||FP||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*N|cp||at|That has been my question and finally I received the following answer from Howard.|
PG| ***** 270 ***** |


AT|

As a general rule, it is usually much harder to take nine tricks than seven tricks. And three of a minor requires that you take nine tricks whereas 1N requires you only have to take seven tricks. Therefore, unless you are pretty sure you are going to take three more tricks in a minor-suit contract than in NT, you should not transfer. (If you take two more tricks in a minor-suit contract, you break even.) So, how do you know if a minor-suit contract will yield three more tricks? |
PG| ***** 271 ***** |


AT|

Well, you don't. But here are some guidelines that work pretty well. If you have a 7-card minor and a weak hand, transfer. If you have a 6-card minor and shortness somewhere (a singleton or void) and a weak hand, transfer. Otherwise, don't bother.|
PG| ***** 272 ***** |


AT| 

By the way, this is essentially the same logic as to why you strongly prefer to play 3N as opposed to 5 of a minor. It is much easier to take nine tricks than eleven.|

Opener passes with better hearts, and corrects to 2S with better spades. The final contract is often a 7-card major suit fit (since the NT opener cannot have a doubleton in both hearts and spades), but this is usually better than playing 1N with a weak dummy.|

^-{ Constructive Auctions after a NT Opening Bid }

{          Weak NT Opening Bids          }
^-|HT|g|cp||FP||at|^b@2^z@3I like NT openings so much that I play 12-14 point 1NT openers, which means that I open many more hands 1NT than most people. I'm not sure why this treatment has not caught on more (most bridge players feel the strong NT has been ordained from on high!) because I think it has many advantages.|
PG| ***** 279 ***** |


AT|

Before I get into the advantages, let me explain how I show a strong NT. After opening a minor suit, I simply bid NT as my next bid (e.g. 1D-1S-1NT).|
PG| ***** 280 ***** |


AT|

The major advantage is that weak NTs lead to a more natural bidding style. For strong NT bidders, opening one of a minor can describe many different hand types, from a long suit to a minimum hand with NT distribution. With a weak NT, when I open 1 of a minor, I usually have a 5-card suit (with a 4-card suit I would open 1NT). Also, the weak NT has pre-emptive value; responder knows a lot about opener's hand and where we should play the contract, but the opponents are somewhat in the dark, having to bid at the 2 level in order to get into the auction.|
PG| ***** 281 ***** |


AT|

Clearly, the point values for responder's hand change accordingly:|
PG| ***** 282 ***** |


HT|s|AT|

HT|s|AT|
* Minimum - no more than 9 points; game is not possible
* Medium - 10-11 points; game is possible if opener has a maximum NT
* Maximum - 12 or more points; you must bid game

Other than that, the auctions are pretty much identical to strong NT auctions.|
PG| ***** 286 ***** |


at|

I am not suggesting you play weak no trumps (in fact, quite the contrary, because it will be  difficult for you to find any partners who play it), but hopefully it will help you appreciate how nice it is when partner opens 1NT.|

pg| ***** 372 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3With the points to invite or force to game, responder never insists on playing in his 5-card major suit. He always gives opener the option of playing in either the transfer suit or no trump, because he (responder) can't be sure that they have an 8-card fit. |
pg| ***** 373 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3If responder transfers and then rebids no trump, it isn't because he wants to play in no trump. If he just wanted to play in no trump, he wouldn't have bothered transferring. When responder transfers and rebids no trump, it is because he needs you to decide whether the partnership belongs in the major (if opener has 3+ card support) or in NT if opener only has a doubleton. |
pg| ***** 374 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3 If opener has 3+ card support, HE IS EXPECTED TO GO BACK TO RESPONDER'S MAJOR. If opener doesn't do that, then the whole thing falls apart. There definitely should be some partnership trust involved in these transfer auctions.|

CP|8|AT|

*** |CP||AT|There are very few hands where 3N does not make and 5 of a minor does make. I recommend you not look for excuses to avoid 3NT. Rather, try and play 3N when you have game going values and no major suit fit. Even if you are short in a particular suit. In the long run, you will do better playing 3N rather than 5 of a minor. Too many players unnecessarily avoid playing 3N, and often go down in 5 of the minor.|

bobottawa: Do the same rules apply if opener has a 5 card major, not just a 4?|
PG| ***** 438 ***** |


CP|8|AT|

*** |CP||AT|Yes, if opener bids a major in response to Stayman, on occasion it will be a 5 card suit. However, responder should assume it is a 4 card suit. Some people play a complicated form of Stayman known as "Puppet Stayman", where opener can show whether his length is 5 cards or 4 cards. Over 1N, some people use 3C as Puppet Stayman, 2C as regular Stayman. For most people, I recommend straight Stayman, not worrying about occasionally missing the 5-3 fit. With straight Stayman, you will always discover the 5-4 fit. And often, since opener has a balanced hand, NT plays as well (or better) than the 5-3 fit. Remember, you only have to take 9 tricks to make a NT game, 10 tricks to make a major suit game.|

PG| ***** 444 ***** |


CP|8|AT|

*** |CP||AT|If responder transfers, most experts play that opener can jump to 3 of the transfer suit with 4 card support. That is known as a "super accept". That response is based on the Law of Total Tricks (known 9 card fit). That is a reasonable way to play. On the plus side, it allows responder to raise to 4 on some hands where you might otherwise only bid a part score. On the minus side, if responder has a weak hand, you occasionally get too high. Some experts even have complicated super-accept conventions, but that is beyond the scope of this lesson.|

As an example, if the auction goes 1N-2C-2H-2N-3H, opener is showing a max NT opener with 5 hearts. 3H is forcing, and responder must either bid 3N with a doubleton or 4H with 3 card support. The same applies if the auction goes 1N-2C-2S-3N-3S.|

^-|FP||cp||at|^B@2MsPetey: How does Opener know Resp. has 6 card suit=9 card fit ?|
PG| ***** 448 ***** |


CP|8|AT|

*** |CP||AT|When responder has a six card suit, he or she does not return to NT. With a min hand, obviously responder still passes. With a medium hand, responder bids 3 of the major. (1N-2D-2H-3H and 1N-2H-2S-3S). With a max hand, responder bids 4 of the major. (1N-2D-2H-4H and 1N-2H-2S-4S). So, the auctions 1N-2D/2H-2H/2S-2N and 1N-2D/2H-2H/2S-3N mean that responder has exactly a 5 card major.|

CP|8|AT|

*** |CP||AT|I play that the auction 1N-2H-2S-3H is invitational with 5/5. Not all experts agree. Some play that as forcing. With a game forcing 5/5, I would bid 1N-2H-2S-4H.|

Sunrise4U: Why do experts differentiate and how?|
PG| ***** 453 ***** |


CP|8|AT|

*** |CP||AT|Experts consider the auction 1N-2D-2H-4H and 1N-2H-2S-4S as mild slam tries. Responder has 15ish points and a six card major. In my experience, that auction rarely occurs. For years, I did not play Texas (still don't with many partners), and I have not missed it. I do play 1N-3x (any suit)  is a slam try in the suit bid. |

^B@2hondo717: ok. let's get started
hondo717: welcome to my 2nd class on Fundamentals of Constructive Bidding
hondo717: the purpose of these classes is to teach you the fundamentals behind most popular bidding systems
hondo717: many people memorize rules of bidding but do not understand why those rules were invented
hondo717: hopefully, after these classes, you will understand the whys and therefore will be able to figure out what to bid, rather than memorizing a bunch of rules
hondo717: tonight's lesson is on auctions starting with 1NT
hondo717: ok, lets get started
hondo717: auctions when the opening bid is 1N are usually pretty straight forward
hondo717: those who attended the last lesson remember the concept of the "captain of the bidding"
hondo717: to briefly review, in every auction, one person is "captain", the other is "subordinate"
hondo717: it is the job of the captain to determine the final contract, both level and strain
hondo717: the captain does this by asking his or her partner "questions" about their hand
hondo717: it is the job of the subordinate partner to answer those questions
hondo717: on many auctions, responder is the captain
hondo717: on hands where the opening bid is 1NT, this is particularly true
hondo717: once you open 1NT, your partner is responsible for placing the final contract
hondo717: because 1NT is such a descriptive bid, that is usually pretty easy to do
hondo717: so, remember, if your partner opens 1NT, you are in charge of making sure you get to the right contract
hondo717: because 1NT is such a descriptive bid, you should open it whenever possible|
PG| ***** 457 ***** |


tu||NT||at|^B@2^Y@3
hondo717: most people play a 1NT opener shows 15-17 HCP, and one of 3 distributions: 4-3-3-3 4-4-3-2 or 5-3-3-2
hondo717: another way to say this is your hand can have at most one doubleton
hondo717: there is a tendency by some people to stretch the distributions on occasion and open 1N with 6-3-2-2 and perhaps 5-4-2-2
hondo717: but I personally don't care to do that
hondo717: however, one thing that I highly recommend is that you open 1NT even with a 5 card major
hondo717: most experts agree with that
hondo717: when you have a 15-17 point balanced hand, it is very difficult to get your points across if you open 1H or 1S
hondo717: the auction will often go 1H/1S-P-1N
hondo717: you could bid 2N, but that will often get you too high
hondo717: so because 1N is so descriptive, opening 1N with a 5 card major is preferable
hondo717: some people worry about missing a major suit fit
hondo717: the only time that is even an issue is when partner has exactly 3 card support in the 5 card major
hondo717: with 4 card support, partner would bid Stayman
hondo717: so, it is possible to miss a 5-3 fit, but most of the time NT plays as well as the 5-3 fit
hondo717: ok, now let's talk about responder
hondo717: if you remember from last time, responder can classify his hand as one of three categories
hondo717: minimum response, medium response, or maximum response
hondo717: the only difference from the last lesson is the point counts for these classifications is different
hondo717: a minimum response hand is 7 points or less
hondo717: if responder has a minimum hand, game is not possible, so the idea is to stay as low as you can
hondo717: you will either play in 1NT or 2 of a major
hondo717: so with a min hand, the idea is to get out ASAP
hondo717: a medium hand is 8 or 9 points
hondo717: if responder has a medium hand, game is possible, but only if opener has a max NT opener
hondo717: I will define what a max NT opener is in a few minutes
Dianne0516: How about minor transfers on min hand?
hondo717: but the point is, with a medium hand, responder invites game, and opener accepts with a max
hondo717: if responder has 10 or more points, then he or she has a max response
hondo717: in that case, responder is responsible for making sure their side gets to game|
PG| ***** 458 ***** |


NT||at|^B@2^Y@3
hondo717: with a max hand, responder must NEVER make a bid that opener can pass
hondo717: ok, now let me talk about opener's hand categories
hondo717: for NT openers, since the range is so narrow, there are only two categories
hondo717: a min NT opener, and a max NT opener
hondo717: and the only time it is important for opener to distinguish is when responder makes an invitational bid
hondo717: if responder makes an invitational bid, opener goes to game with a max NT hand
hondo717: a max NT hand meets one of the following criteria
hondo717: -- any 17 point hand
hondo717: -- any 16 HCP hand with a fit for partner's major
hondo717: -- any 16 HCP hand with a 5 card suit
hondo717: -- any 16 HCP with at two or more 10s and 9s and not 4-3-3-3 distribution

hondo717: ok, now we know when we should bid game
MikeJ: Please repeat criterion ##4
hondo717: criteria 4 for a max hand is as follows:
hondo717: 16 HCP, at least 2 10s and 9s, and not 4-3-3-3
 
hondo717: ok, now that we know when we should bid game, let's talk about what strain (suit or NT) to choose
hondo717: one important rule to remember is, it is fairly rare that you would rather play 5 of a minor than 3NT
 
hondo717: I won't say it never happens that you want to play 5 of a minor, but too many people bypass 3NT when they should be there
hondo717: it is usually much harder to take 11 tricks than 9 tricks
hondo717: so your mind set should be, you want to play either 3NT or 4 of a major
hondo717: you almost never want to play 5 of a minor
tashmore: My last remark received many responses that I was to direct ?s to you

hondo717: therefore, responder's job in defining which suit to play in is simply to determine if there is the possibility of a major suit fit
hondo717: if there is no possibility of a major suit fit, then responder should place the contract in the appropriate level of NT|
PG| ***** 459 ***** |


NT||at|^B@2^Y@3

hondo717: responder should look for a major suit fit if he or she has 4 or more cards in at least one of the major suits
hondo717: otherwise responder should assume the contract will be in NT
hondo717: so, as responder, if you do not have a 4+ card major, your choices are simple
hondo717: with a min hand, pass
hondo717: with a medium hand, invite by bidding 2N
hondo717: with a max hand, bid 3N
hondo717: pretty simple
hondo717: don't worry about shortness or long minors
hondo717: if you have the right ## of HCP bid 3NT or 2NT
hondo717: you will occasionally be wrong, but most of the time you will do fine
hondo717: ok, so what does responder do if they have a 4+ card major
hondo717: there are two conventions that take care of finding out whether or not to play in a major
hondo717: they are Stayman and Jacoby Transfers
hondo717: you should bid Stayman under the following circumstances
hondo717: a) You have a medium or maximum hand
 
hondo717: (I will talk about a possible exception to this later, but for now, assume you cannot bid Stayman with a min)
hondo717: you have one 4 card major, 2 four card majors, or one 4 card major and one 5 card major
hondo717: those are the only distributions where you should bid Stayman
hondo717: basically, Stayman is defined to find a 4-4 major fit
hondo717: if you have more than 4 cards in a major, you generally should use Jacoby Transfers
hondo717: the only exception being when you are exactly 5/4 in the majors
hondo717: as most of you know, I am sure, a 2!C response to 1NT is the Stayman convention
hondo717: when responder bids 2!C, he or she is saying nothing about clubs
hondo717: responder is simply asking if opener has a 4 card major
hondo717: if opener has a 4 card major, he or she bids that major
hondo717: if opener does not have a 4 card major, the response is 2!D
hondo717: with two 4-card majors, most people play that opener bids 2!H
hondo717: ok, let's first talk about what responder does with a max hand
hondo717: if opener does not show a one of responder's 4 card majors, then responder simply bids 3NT|
PG| ***** 460 ***** |


NT||at|^B@2^Y@3
hondo717: if opener shows one of responder's 4 card majors, then responder bids 4 of that major
hondo717: that's it
hondo717: opener almost always respects responder's final decision
hondo717: there is one exception
hondo717: if opener has two 4 card majors, then opener knows that there has to be a 4-4 major fit
hondo717: responder should never bid Stayman without a 4 card major
hondo717: therefore, if responder bids Stayman, and opener has 2 4 card majors, there has to be a 4-4 fit
hondo717: so, if the auction goes 1N-2C-2H-3N
hondo717: opener knows that responder must have 4 spades
hondo717: opener bid Stayman showing a 4 card major
hondo717: sorry I mean responder bid Stayman
hondo717: so responder is showing a 4 card major
hondo717: if the 4 card major is not hearts, it has to be spades
hondo717: so, if opener has two 4 card majors, he or she is allowed to override responder's decision to bid 3N, and bid 4S
hondo717: that is the only case where that is true, when opener has two 4 card majors
hondo717: ok, with a medium hand, responder does one of the following

hondo717: if opener bids a 4 card major that responder has, responder raises to 3 of the major
hondo717: otherwise, responder bids 2N
hondo717: opener should bid game with a max hand, as I defined before 
hondo717: if responder invites in 3 of a major, opener should go with 16-17 points
hondo717: if responder invites with 2N, then opener should go with a max hand, using the criteria I defined before
hondo717: and, if opener has 2 four card majors, and the auction goes 1N-2C-2H-2N
hondo717: then opener should correct to 3S with a min hand (15 HCP) and bid 4S with a max hand
hondo717: ok, that's it for Stayman
hondo717: I said a lot, but the principles are pretty simple
hondo717: responder invites with a medium hand, bids game with a max hand
hondo717: and opener accepts an invitation with a max hand|
PG| ***** 461 ***** |


NT||at|^B@2^Y@3
hondo717: ok, finally, let's talk about Jacoby transfers
hondo717: Jacoby transfers are used by responder when he or she has a 5+ card major
hondo717: pretty much any time responder has a 5 card major, responder should bid a Jacoby Transfer, regardless of strength (even with a min)
hondo717: the only exception (and it is fairly rare) is if responder has exactly 5/4 in the majors and a medium or max response 
hondo717: then responder should use Stayman
hondo717: but virtually all of the time, responder should use Jacoby with a 5+ card major
hondo717: so, when partner opens 1N and you have a 5+ card major, your first instinct should be to use a Jacoby transfer
hondo717: now, let me briefly review the mechanics of the convention, although I am sure most of you know it
hondo717: if you have 5+ hearts, you, as responder, bid 2@D
hondo717: this obligates opener to bid 2@H
hondo717: you have "transferred" the heart contract from your hand to opener's hand
hondo717: even though you have hearts you want opener to be declarer
hondo717: there are a number of theoretical reasons why this is a good thing
hondo717: but don't worry about them for now. just remember you have to use a transfer with a 5+ card major
hondo717: similarly, if you have spades, you, as responder bid 2@H
hondo717: this obligates opener to bid 2@S
hondo717: that's it for the most part
hondo717: there are extensions to Jacoby Transfers, but for this lesson I am not going to worry about them
hondo717: I am going to stick with the simple 2@D forces 2@H and 2@H forces 2@S
hondo717: on most hands, that is what should happen
hondo717: ok, now, once responder forces opener to accept the transfer, what should responder do?
hondo717: with a minimum hand, the answer is easy
hondo717: just pass
hondo717: if responder has a weak hand, playing in responder's 5 card suit (even with a 5-2 fit) is almost always better than playing in 1NT
hondo717: so if you have a weak hand and a 5 card major, make a Jacoby transfer intending to pass opener's forced response|
PG| ***** 462 ***** |


NT||at|^B@2^Y@3
hondo717: ok, now let's talk about what you do with a max hand
hondo717: if responder has a max (10+ HCP), their side must be in game
hondo717: the only question is, which game
hondo717: if responder has a six card major, then their side must have at least an 8 card fit (opener must have at least a doubleton)
hondo717: so responder should just bid 4 of the major
hondo717: with a 5 card major, responder is not sure whether to play 3N or 4 of the major
hondo717: so responder bids 3N
hondo717: some people claim this is a "shut out" bid
hondo717: those people are wrong, lol
hondo717: 3NT by responder, after a transfer, is giving opener a choice of games
hondo717: with a doubleton in the major, opener passes
hondo717: with 3 or more in the major, opener bids 4 of the major
hondo717: so remember, the auction 1N-2H-2S-3N is not a shut out
hondo717: it is a choice between 3N and 4S
hondo717: ok, what about with a medium hand
hondo717: the choices are similar to what you do with a max hand, but at a lower level
hondo717: if responder has a six card major, responder should invite by bidding 3 of the major
hondo717: opener should accept with a max hand, or 3 or more cards in the major
hondo717: even with 15 HCP, if opener has 3 cards in the major suit, with a known 9 card fit, opener should accept
hondo717: so, for example, if the auction goes 1N-2D-2H-3H
hondo717: opener should bid 4H with any hand that has 3 or more hearts
hondo717: and should also bid 4H even with a doubleton heart, with a max hand, as defined before
hondo717: one good general bidding principle to remember is
hondo717: 9 card fits are very powerful
hondo717: so you should tend to be more aggressive with a 9 card fit
hondo717: if partner invites game (in any auction) and you know you have a 9 card major suit fit, you should accept the invitation
hondo717: similarly, you should be conservative with an 8 card fit
hondo717: if partner invites and you know you only have an 8 card fit, you should tend to not bid a close game
hondo717: that principle applies to all auctions not just NT auctions|
PG| ***** 463 ***** |


NT||at|^B@2^Y@3
hondo717: ok, back to Jacoby transfers
hondo717: the only thing left is when responder has a medium hand and a 5 card major
hondo717: in that case, responder bids 2N over the transfer
hondo717: so, for example, the auction 1N-2D-2H-2N says the following
hondo717: responder has exactly 5 hearts and 8 or 9 points
hondo717: opener can now easily figure out what to do
hondo717: with a doubleton and a min hand, pass
hondo717: with 3 card support, and a min hand, correct to 3 of the major
hondo717: with a min hand and 4 card support, bid 4 of the major (known 9 card fit)
hondo717: with a max hand and a doubleton, opener bids 3N
 hondo717: and with a max hand and 3+ card support, opener bids 4 of the major
hondo717: that's pretty much it
hondo717: you can have some complicated auctions with transfers
hondo717: but for now, I suggest you keep things simple, until you get the basics down
hondo717: most of the time, you will do fine with the simple approach
hondo717: one small comment about Texas Transfers
hondo717: most people on BBO play that with a max response and a 6 card major, you transfer at the 4 level
hondo717: in other words, the auction 1N-4D means responder has 6+ hearts and a max hand
hondo717: responder is telling opener to bid 4H
hondo717: similarly, the auction 1N-4H shows responder has a max with 6+ spades
hondo717: there is nothing wrong with playing Texas, but it is also unnecessary
hondo717: experts differentiate between the following two auctions: 1N-2H-2S-4S and 1N-4H-4S
hondo717: but most non-experts do not differentiate
hondo717: if you do not differentiate between those 2 auctions then there is no reason to play Texas
hondo717: but there is no reason not to play it either, unless partner forgets the convention :)
hondo717: ok, lets do a few quiz hands
hondo717: assume partner opens 1NT
hondo717: I will give you a hand
hondo717: you need to determine two things
hondo717: the first thing is: is the hand a min, medium, or max response
hondo717: the second thing is: what do you bid, both initially, and after hearing opener's rebid
hondo717: on any auction where partner opens 1N, this is what your thinking process should be|
PG| ***** 464 ***** |


NT||at|^B@2^Y@3
hondo717: first, determine your hand strength
hondo717: second, figure out not only your first bid, but the follow ups to opener's possible rebids
hondo717: ok, here is hand 1
hondo717: @SKxxx @HKxxx @DJxx @Cxx
hondo717: what kind of response -- minimum
hondo717: remember, only bid Stayman with a medium or max hand
hondo717: otherwise partner will often overbid
hondo717: ok, here is hand 2
hondo717: @SKxxx @HKxxxx @Dxx @Cxx
Sunrise4U: before my time.......
hondo717: what type of hand? min
hondo717: therefore, you want to get out ASAP
hondo717: but, you would rather play in a 5 card suit than 1N
hondo717: so, you bid 2D, transfer to hearts, and plan on passing the forced 2H bid
hondo717: don't worry about the spade suit
 hondo717: ok, next example
hondo717: @SKxxx @HKxxx @DQxx @Cxx
hondo717: what kind of hand?
hondo717: med, since you have at least one 4 card major, you should bid Stayman
hondo717: so you bid 2@C
hondo717: if partner shows a major suit you raise to 3, asking him or her to bid 4 with a max NT
hondo717: if partner bids 2@D over 2@C, you bid 2N, asking partner to bid 3N with a max NT opener|
PG| ***** 465 ***** |


NT||at|^B@2^Y@3
hondo717: ok, example 4
hondo717: @SQxx @HKxxxx @DKxx @Cxx
hondo717: what kind of hand?
hondo717: med, you also have a 5 card major, so Jacoby is appropriate
hondo717: bid 2@D
hondo717: over partner's forced 2@H response, bid 2N
hondo717: remember, that shows you have exactly 5 hearts and a medium hand
hondo717: it is giving partner a choice of contracts
hondo717: with a min hand and a doubleton, pard passes
hondo717: with a min hand and 3 hearts, pard bids 3@H
hondo717: with a min hand and 4 card support, pard bids 4@H (9 card fit)
hondo717: with a max hand and a doubleton, pard bids 3N
hondo717: with a max hand and 3+ hearts, pard bids 4@H
hondo717: again, if you understand the concepts, figuring out what to bid is a matter of deduction, not memorizing rules
hondo717: ok, example 5
hondo717: @SKQxx @HKxxxx @Dxx @Cxx
hondo717: what kind of hand?
 hondo717: this is the rare hand where, because you are exactly 5/4 in the majors, and have a medium or max hand, you bid Stayman
hondo717: so you bid 2C
hondo717: if partner responds 2D,, you bid 2H. that shows 5 hearts and 4 spades
hondo717: if partner bids 2H, I would bid 4H (9 card fit), although that is aggressive
hondo717: and if partner bids 2S, I would bid 3S, inviting pard to bid 4S with a max
hondo717: ok, here is hand 6
hondo717: @SKxx @HKxx @DQxxxx @Cxx
hondo717: what kind of hand?
hondo717: medium, no 4+ card major
hondo717: so simply invite with 2N
hondo717: pard will bid 3N with a max NT opener, as I defined before|
PG| ***** 466 ***** |


NT||at|^B@2^Y@3hondo717: ok example 7
hondo717: @SQxxxx @SQxxxx @Dxx @Cx
hondo717: what kind of hand?
hondo717: ok, you want to play in one of your majors with minimum
hondo717: you can transfer to either one
hondo717: so you either bid 2@D planning on passing 2@H, or you bid 2@H planning on passing 2@S
hondo717: your choice
hondo717: ok hand 8
hondo717: @SKxxx @HQxx @DKQxxx @Cx
hondo717: max, you want to see if you have a 4-4 spade fit
hondo717: so bid 2C. over a 2S response, bid 4S
hondo717: over any other response bid 3N
hondo717: remember, if partner responded 2@H and also had a 4 card spade suit, partner can correct 3N to 4S
hondo717: ok hand 9
hondo717: @Sx @HQxx @DKQxxx @CKxxx
hondo717: what kind of hand
hondo717: max, no chance of a major suit fit
hondo717: so just bid 3N (and hope pard has spades stopped :) )
hondo717: ok example 10
hondo717: @Sx @HKQxxx @DQxx @CKxxx 
hondo717: indeed this is a max  and you have a 5 card major
hondo717: so bid 2@D
hondo717: over the forced 2@H response, bid 3N
hondo717: this tells partner you have exactly 5 hearts and a max hand
hondo717: remember, 3N is a choice of games. it is NOT a shutout bid
hondo717: partner should correct 3N to 4H with 3+ hearts|
PG| ***** 467 ***** |


NT||at|^B@2^Y@3
hondo717: ok, last hand
hondo717: @SKxxxx @HKQxxx @Dxx @Cx
 
hondo717: this is a slightly trick question
hondo717: yes officially you only have 8 HCP
hondo717: but you must have at least one 8 card major suit fit
hondo717: partner cannot have doubletons in both majors
 
hondo717: so you are entitled to count your shortness
bobottawa: to you
hondo717: which gets your hand up to 11 points using classical point count (2 for singleton, 1 for doubleton)
hondo717: so I would consider this a max
hondo717: and I would bid it as follows
hondo717: I would first transfer to spades, by bidding 2@H
hondo717: and then over the forced 2@S response, I would bid 4@H
