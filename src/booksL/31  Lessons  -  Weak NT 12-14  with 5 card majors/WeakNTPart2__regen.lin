cp||at|This article is the second of three introducing the weak 1NT opening bid (12-14 HCP). In the first article, I discussed uncontested auctions in which there is a weak NT opening. In this article, I discuss how to bid if you play the weak 1NT opener and you hold a strong NT. In the third article, I will discuss how to handle the auction when the opponents compete over your weak 1NT opener. |

at|{|ia|-1hp1sp1np|at|}|at|^b@2|ht|t|cp||at|^bMany weak NT players play that the 1NT bid shows a balanced hand with 12-14 HCP or so. I played that way for many years. However, this gives opener a problem when he has 15-17 HCP. There is no good way to show that hand. By the way, that is why I strongly recommend to those players who play strong NT that they open 1NT any time they hold 15-17 HCP and a balanced hand even with a 5-card major. My solution is to play it as opener is showing a strong NT (15-17).|

at|^^|cp||at|^bAnother consideration is the 1N and 2N responses. I recommend you tend to avoid these whenever possible, because you would prefer the contract be played by partner if he has a strong NT. Note that I recommend you still play inverted minors. Therefore, with 10+ points and 4 card support, you should raise to the 2 level; note that, unlike when playing strong 1N openers, this is very safe, because partner either has the strong NT or a 5+ card suit. Over a 1D opener, I will also favor a 2@c bid over a 2N bid if I have a choice; I will often bid 2@c with 3-3-3-4 distribution and 10+ points. With 5 card support and less than 10 points, I recommend you make a jump raise to the 3 level, even if you have a balanced hand. Again, this is very safe and quite effective. Opener often has an unbalanced hand with a 5+ card suit, so you have managed to preempt the opponents. And if partner has the strong NT, playing in an 8+ card fit at the 3 level is fine. |
