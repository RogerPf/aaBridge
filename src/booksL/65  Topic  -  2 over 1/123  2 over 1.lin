QX|B01, A Prologue|
cs|1|cp|4|fp|1|HT|e|AT|^-{A Prologue}
^-|CP||fp||AT|^C@2^y@3This is a short journal outlining my struggle learning bridge and my attempt to join the elite players by learning the coveted 2 over 1, while hardly can declare a minimally complex auction. I would be happy if it helps you learn 2 over 1 with more ease and less confusion. However, please do not expect a Marco Polo journal. To learn 2 over 1 you can find great sources--several of them are listed later. 

Retired and feeling useless, two years ago I decided to learn bridge. My wife purchased beginner books after talking with Mr. Marty Bergen and I added couple bridge CDs. I foolishly thought there was nothing to it. I figured in six to maximum eight weeks I would Ace it and beat everyone in our local club.

Six and even eight weeks went by and I was more a source of humor in our club than a champion. Undaunted, I decided to expand my reach and increase the time spent on conquering the beast. So, I had great experience with Fifth Chair and Richard Pavlicek web sites and finally and thankfully landed in BBO and BIL, where Maureen took me under her wings and my real hard work began. 

In BBO/BIL, I was like a child in a candy shop. I met many great teachers who were teaching for free and had time to answer questions. I also met many players who were  brave and willing to play with me and help me go forward without stepping on too many cow pies

You may say I was in bridge heaven and decided to learn the best system there was. Yes, I was really a newbie and thought I should learn the most advanced system that ws available, until a wise teacher who later became my mentor and shaped my bridge structure told me, "First, learn SAYC well then you can go on to other advanced areas."  Later, I will share with you an inventory of what I have learned in SAYC which I can still use while playing 2 over 1. |

cs|1|cp|4|fp|1|HT|E|at|^-{A Prologue}
^-|CP||FP||AT|^C@2^y@3Two years later when I finally decided to take the plunge my mentor response to my e-mail query was,

^*b"1) Most expert players prefer 2 over 1. Up until a few years ago, 2 over 1 was really "advanced SAYC" (e.g. inverted minors, limit or Bergen Raises, RKCB, negative doubles, and so forth) plus the 2 over 1 stuff. However, now SAYC includes many advanced conventions. Therefore, although I would still say 2 over 1 is somewhat of an improvement over SAYC, the difference is not nearly as great, so if you just stuck to SAYC, on most hands, you would not be at a disadvantage. I still think it is a good idea for you to learn 2 Over 1, but it will not improve your bidding as much as you might otherwise think, because you know a lot of advanced conventions already.

2) Almost all SAYC conventions are used in 2 over 1. There are really only two differences, in major suit auctions. If you bid 2 over 1 of a major, that is a game force. And, if you respond 1N to one of a major, that is a one round force. And those differences only apply if there is no interference. Other than those two differences, SAYC and 2 Over 1 Auctions are identical.

3) Basically, you need some criteria to decide if you have a game forcing hand. I play that having a rule of 20 hand qualifies as a game forcing hand, and is the easiest and best way for you to make that decision."^*N

Well that sums it up. Seriously, now I know all there is to 2 over 1. But, I have another point to tell you. While I am at it I really want to build a scaffolding for my "how to open one of the majors and proper responses to such openings" while learning 2 over 1 and burn it on my forehead. Another good teacher told me, "In part, you already are playing 2 over 1. You have to close the circle."   |

cs|1|cp|4|fp|1|HT|E|at|^-{               My New Tool Box - and 2 over 1               }
|CP|8|AT|Openings while playing 2 over 1
^-|CP||FP||AT|^C@2^y@3Adding 2 over 1 to the tool box should not be that difficult. Remembering all the nuances is the hard part. Let me check my original tool box and see what I have and whether I should discard a few old tools or add a few new ones. After all a heavy tool box does not necessarily make me a good mechanic. Now, let me examine the tools in the box one by one. BTW, I hope you recall that this is my learning process. So bear with me.

1. I will open one of major any |cp|8|at|"suitable"|cp||at| hand. By now, I should know the hand evaluation, HCPs, the quality of the suits, the quick tricks, the defensive tricks, Rule 20 and most importantly the new hand evaluation by Marty Bergen.

2. At any chance, except at fourth seat, I will pre-empt 2D, 2H, and 2S holding a |cp|8|at|"suitable"|cp||at| hand. Howard teaches, "I think any time you have 5-10 points and a six card suit (assuming you don't meet the rule of 20), you should open a weak two." I  would be a bit more cautious on the "suitable" part though. No disrespect Howard, I am not that good of declarer as yet.

3. Open 2C with the proper hand and/or point count. 

4. Yes, with "real" 20-21 HCPs and a balanced hand I love to open 2NT. I even do it with five card major. I may even do it with two doubleton. However, I like at least one of those doubletons fully stopped.

5. For minors, however, I love the line by Mike Lawrence and he says,|cp|8|at|

"Rule: With balanced hands on which you decide not to bid a major suit, bid the longer of your minor suit. If minor suits are three cards only, open one club."|cp||at|

|CP|8|AT|Openings while playing 2 over 1
^-|CP||fp||at|^C@2^y@3Further, I almost always open one diamond if I have 4-4 in minors unless the Diamonds are really puny. Of course I know that only with 4-4-3-2 shape we open one diamond.

6. As I said, I open 1H/1S any suitable hand with 5 card plus in that major. With 5-5 I open the higher ranking. With  five spades and five clubs I can flip a coin. But, I do not know about you because I always fumble the ball when I get a great hand with 5 Spades and 5 Clubs or 5/6 and etc. So, again let me share with you what Howard suggests and I will follow.

"With 5/5, you always open the higher ranking suit (skip spades and clubs for a minute), ^*Bnot the stronger suit^*N. This is to make your bidding more economical, as you can repeat your 2nd suit at a lower level, and partner can correct to the higher ranking suit at the same level. Even with reverse level strength, you open your higher ranking suit. If you reverse, your first suit is always longer than your second suit."

"Now with spades and clubs there are two theories. In the old days, you opened 1C, because you then got to repeat your spades at the 2 level, allowing partner to correct to 3C. If you opened spades, and then bid clubs twice, partner would have to correct 3C to 3S, so you would be higher. However, these days, most people open 1S with 5/5 in the blacks, the idea being that, particularly with all the preempting that is going around, you want to get your spade length across as early as possible. So, take your pick and make sure partner agrees. If playing with an unfamiliar partner, open 1S." 

"With 6/5, if you have less than a reverse, you open the higher ranking suit, even if it is the 5 card suit. With reverse strength, if your lower ranking suit is a six card suit, you can open in the lower ranking suit and reverse into the higher ranking suit (because your opening suit is still longer than your second suit)."

|CP|8|AT|Openings while playing 2 over 1
^-|CP||fp||at|^C@2^y@37. My favorite is 1NT opening. Strictly, balanced hands and 15-17 point and no more than one doubleton. Five card major is no problem.  And, I also like the following by Mike Lawrence, |cp|8|at|"If your hand contains the correct number of points to open one notrump, do it except when it is clearly right to open something else."|cp||at| Needless, to mention that in another book he backtracks a bit on 5-card majors. There, he suggests opening one of major if the suit is very strong. I like to keep my bidding simple so I open 1NT with any 5-card major. I had concerns regarding including Qx and Jx in my 15-17 points. But, Marty Bergen solved that problem for me. He has a simple and fairly reliable method to determine an accurate value of your hand before any bidding. He calls that value "Starting Points" which is a God's gift for me. No more memorizing "so many ways to love my hand." 


8. Okay, let us forget the openings with esoteric hands (such as six or seven of this or that) which I may see once in a blue moon.

So far, I am relived that all my hard learned SAYC rules are compatible with 2 over 1 and I can go to the next step. But, after all said and done I like to keep the following self made rule:|Cs|4|at|^-

{CAREFULLY, CONSIDER MY REBID BEFORE OPENING THE HAND}

^-{RESPONSES TO 1H/1S OPENING IN SAYC}
^-|CP||CS||fp||at|^C@2^y@3I am getting close to the heart of the issue--responses. First, let me define the circumstances and lay out the rules. I am strictly in a constructive bidding (opponents are silent) and partner opens 1H-1S.  Further, I like to bid game as often as possible and I expect learning 2 over 1 would help me.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT|

I am confident I can use my hard learned SAYC bidding tools when I play 2 over 1. I have confirmation from Howard who said, "In general, major suit raises are the same in both SAYC and 2 over 1." 

So, first let me see how in SAYC would I respond to 1H-1S openings with hands of varying strength and support or lack of when the opponents are silent. |cp|8|at|2 over 1 is off when there is competition|cp||at|.  Now, let me start from scratch.  

Let me remind you again this is my  learning 2 over 1 journal. Thus, what you will read next is really an attempt to outline my responses in SAYC and the changes I have to make when I play 2 over 1.  While I am outlining them I will learn the differences between SAYC and 2 over 1. The full explanation for 2 over 1 specific bids will follow. 

I usually can visualize and understand bridge topics better when I have a real hand in front of me. So, let us go to a table and look at various hands and auctions. In all I am sitting South. Further, BBO is so nice because it cheers me along when I pick the correct answer.|

Next, is what does the "point" count really means. sometime it is a HCP, other times it is a "dummy", once a while it is a "true" and etc.|

^B@2I have adopted Bergen's "Starting Points" and "True Value" for hand evaluation and all related biddings. Further, I have adopted his recommendations for "upgrade" and "downgrade" the hand during the auction. Get the whole detail from his new book. Need info on the book?

The other alternative is to play a jump to 3 shows 5 or less, and opener is not supposed to bid game. I have just started playing that way.

%%%%%%%%%%%% next page
BT||HT|d|CP||CS||fp||at|^c@2^y@3So far so good. I am done with almost all the tools with SAYC label and how to use them responding to the partner opening 1H/1S in SAYC. It appears that I can use all when I adopt 2 over 1. But what would I do when partner opens 1H and I have a 3-2-4-4 shape, or partner opens 1S and I hold a hand with 2-3-5-5 shape with either an opening strength or below it. I already know what an opening strength is I hope.

When playing 2 over 1, neither of those tools I mentioned earlier would help to handle those situations nicely.  To handle those situations I am going to place two new tools with 2 over 1 label on them in my tool box. In SAYC handling the above hands are doable but you can do a better job using 2 over 1 specific tools. Those tools are:|

Now, I have to familiarize myself with those two new tools and learn how to use them effectively. That is it. No fuss or pain. Okay, I agree with you that learning the front part of any new convention is easy. What is very difficult is how to go forward after the first step and how to follow up properly.|

It always reminds me of the first dance. Do you remember the first dance after you had your first dancing lesson?  I remember. I mustered all my courage to ask the girl for the dance. I am on the floor with her who is waiting for my next move. Then I froze and asked myself, "Which hand goes behind her back.? Left or right?" Next, I wondered, "OMG, now which foot goes back first?" By then I have stepped on her toes several times. Then, she looked up while batting her eyelashes and lovingly said, "I did not know you were such a good dancer." And, that was when I wished I never have learned how to dance.

For those painful memories on the dance floor I promised myself that I am going to learn all sides of 2 over 1 and not embarrass myself on the bridge table anymore than I am doing now. Let us move on.|

"Let me give some historical perspective as to why it has the reputation of being harder to learn than it is. Back in the Stone Age, when I learned bridge, standard American (it was not called SAYC then) was much simpler. Basically, we played Stayman, transfers, and Blackwood, pretty much that was it.  That was the system played by most beginners and intermediates."|

"Kaplan and Sheinwold wrote a book in the 60s which basically defined 2 over 1. It included new innovations like limit raises (Bergen had not even been thought of yet), inverted minors, negative doubles, and weak 2s. Notice that you all play most of those things already. However, when I began learning 2 over 1 (which was called "Eastern Scientific" back then), I had to learn all those things as well. So you can imagine, that was a daunting task. You all already play those things, so there are only a few things you have to learn to play 2 over 1."|

at|^-{INTRODUCTION AND DEFINITION OF 2 OVER 1}
^-|CP||fp||AT|^C@2^y@3"Auctions which begin with 1N and with 1C or 1D are identical in 2 Over 1 to those in SAYC. The only difference is when you open 1 of a major and really, the only substantive difference is that if responder with an |cp|8|at|"opener"|cp||at| hand bids at the 2 level over 1H or 1S, that is |cp|8|at|Game Force|cp||at|, rather than invitational. The only problem is when responder has a 10 or 11 point invitational hand, which in SAYC would be a 2 level response. In order to handle that problem, 2 over 1 slightly modifies the 1N response to one of a major. Thus, we have |cp|8|at|"1NT Forcing" |cp||at|which is forcing for one round. However, most of the time, you bid 1N with the same hands as in SAYC, but you also bid 1N with the 10 or 11 point invitational hands. Let me summarize it for you."|

cp|8|cs|4|at|

{ If responder bids at the 2 level, that is forcing to game }

cp||at|
"Now, one question is, how does responder determine what a game forcing hand is? Basically, an |cp|8|at|opener|cp||at| vs. an |cp|8|at|opener|cp||at| means you should be in game. I strongly recommend you use the rule of 20 to determine if you have an opening hand. So, if partner opens, and you have a hand that meets the rule of 20 (your high card points plus the length of your 2 longest suits total 20 or more), you have an |cp|8|at|opener|cp||at|--a Game Force."|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


AT|

"2 over 1 forcing to game only applies if there is no interference. In case of interference, the bidding is the same as in SAYC. 2 over 1 is no longer a game force, but is still forcing and shows an invitational hand  or better.  Further, if partner has passed, 2 over 1 also no longer applies, since responder is known to no longer have an opening hand."|

Now, I am going to look at a few example hands, and I would like you to tell me what should I bid. magiemae (claire) has  prepared some of boards for  the lesson. For this presentation I have changed the format of those boards and added a few. In all examples I am sitting South and the partner opens 1H and pass to me. In the bidding box I have several choices which only one is correct. Please note, AS USUAL not all expert agree. Therefore, it is possible to have other good answer.

^C@2^y@3Bid 1S. You are not obligated to bid 2 over 1 if you have a game forcing hand with spades. New suit by responder is still forcing for one round. Although 2 level bids are forcing to game, that does not mean you have to bid a 2 level bid to force to game. That is a frequent misconception for those new to 2 over 1.

You are not hiding the 4 card major, just describing your hand.  Basically, with an opening hand and a 5 card minor and 4 spades, you should bid the minor first. You are not worried about losing the spade fit, as you have established a game forcing auction and can proceed slowly. 1N over 1H denies 4 spades, so you should not bid 1N.|

at|^-{     Howard on Fast Arrival    }
^-|CP||CS|4|fp||at|^C@2^y@3"Fast Arrival" is an important part of 2 over 1 system. Again, the material for learning this issue is from Howard's January 2008 lessons.

|cp|8|at|Howard: |cp||at|The basic idea behind fast arrival is, once a game force is established, the quicker you get to game, the less interested you are in pursuing slam. In other words getting to game "fast" is weaker than getting to game more slowly. For example the following auction, |ht|l|AT|
^c{|ia|,1hp2cp2dp4h|at|}|HT|L|at|^n@2^Y@3shows responder has a pretty weak opening hand  because responder got to game fast. |
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


at|

In contrast the following auction,|HT|s|AT|^c{|ia|,1hp2cp2dp2h|at|}|
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


HT|r|AT|^n@2^y@3 shows a stronger hand  because responder is going more slowly. Once you establish a game force, you go more slowly to explore for slam. Note that this is the opposite of SAYC, where a jump to 4H is mandatory, because 2 over 1 is not a game force. So fast arrival is one of the main advantages that 2 over 1 has over SAYC. |
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


HT|X|AT|
^C@2^Y@3To see fast arrival in action let's look at few examples. Assume North opens 1H, South bids 2C and North bids 2D. What should be the bid over 2D.

^C@2^y@3Based on the principle of fast arrival, you bid 4H. You have a weak opener and a known heart fit. By bidding 2D, partner made a minimum rebid. Therefore, just bid 4H, since that is where you want to play it. No reason to look for slam. With 18+ hand partner could have jumped to 3D.|

Again that is different from SAYC, where 3C is a weak bid. in 2 over 1, 3C is a strong bid. This is how you can get to a club slam, much easier than in SAYC. Remember, once you bid 2 over 1 you are forced to game. So you can bid slowly if you want to look for slam. If you had a simple opener with clubs, you might just bid 3NT over 2D, fast arrival.|

^-|CS||CP||fp|1|at|^C@2^y@32|FP||AT| over|FP|1|AT| 1|FP||AT| discussion would not be complete without reviewing the variations on how 2 over 1 is played.

Again let us find out what Howard mentioned in his lesson. |
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


ht|k|CS|4|AT|^c{|ia|,1dp2cp?|at|}|HT|j|cp|8|at|^N@2^z@3
hondo717: |cp||at|Many play this auction as a game force. Strictly speaking, 2 over 1 only applies when opening bid is 1H or 1S. However, the recent tendency for some is to play 2C over 1D as a game force.  I personally do not play 2C over 1D is a game force. The reason being, the forcing 1N is not available over 1D.|
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


HT|p|AT|^C@2^Y@3So, when you have an invitational hand with clubs, you cannot bid 1NT. However, if you want to play that as a game force, I think that is fine. You and your partner must agree on which way you play it. I have been told the "25 steps" book on 2 over 1 recommends it as a game force.|
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


AT| 

Another variation some people play that if you bid a suit at the 2 level, and repeat it at the 3 level, that is no longer a game force. The auction below is a good example.

^-{|ia|,1hp2cp2dp3c|at|}

BT||HT|E|va|3|cs|1|cp|4|fp|1|
at|^-{       AND THE VARIATIONS       }
^-|CS|4|CP||fp||at|^C@2^y@3However, I think that is not a good way to play it. My feeling is 2 over 1 should unconditionally be forcing to game and I think most experts agree with me on that.|
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


AT|

The third variation is definitely something you have to get straight with each partner, as there is no universal agreement. It concerns whether, once responder bids 2 over 1, and opener reverses, whether or not that shows extra values or not. For example in the following auction,|
PG| ***** 96 ***** |


AT|

^-{|ia|,1hp2dp2s|at|} 
^-
Opener has a reverse. Does that mean opener has at least 16 points? Many people play that a reverse is off once responder bids 2 over 1 and the 2S bid is just describing the hand further. I personally prefer to play that reverses still apply, because then opener can show extra values. Therefore, I play the above auction shows extra values by opener. However, you and your partner need to agree.|
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


AT|

Finally, if opener has 5 hearts and 4 spades with 16 or more points, he should reverse. If he has less than 16 points, he has to rebid 2H or bid 2N, as 2S would show extra values. Some people open a "Flannery 2D"  to show 11-15 with 5 hearts and 4 spades, but I do not recommend it. You are giving up a weak 2D bid, which occurs a lot more frequently, for a rarer hand that can easily be handled in other ways.

qx|B07, Fourth Suit Forcing|
HT|e|va|3|cs|1|cp|4|fp|1|
at|^-{     Fourth Suit Forcing     }
^-|CP||fp||at|^C@2^y@3Fourth Suit Forcing "4SF" is not strictly part of 2 over 1, but it uses many of the same principles. If you understand it, "4SF" is a very good convention to make your bidding more sophisticated and precise. The basic idea is pretty simple. Pard opens a suit, you respond another suit, and pard bids a 3rd suit. Now, if you bid the only remaining suit (the 4th suit), that is an artificial bid. It simply establishes a game force, it says nothing about the 4th suit. The idea is responder wants to establish a game force, but wants to continue exploring for the best contract. Here are some reasons responder bids 4SF:|
pg| ***** 99 ***** |


cp|8|at|

- responder's first suit was a 5 card major, and he would like to know if opener has 3 card support;|
PG| ***** 100 ***** |


AT|
- responder does not have the 4th suit stopped, and would like opener to bid NT with a stopper;|
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


AT|
- responder is interested in slam in one of opener's suits. he will raise the suit with his next bid; and|
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


AT|
- responder's suit is very good 6 card+, and wants to show it, for possible slam.|cp||
pg| ***** 103 ***** |


at|

Responder's next bid after 4SF will clarify why he bid 4SF.|
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


AT|

Why do they call it 4th suit FORCING since the 2/1 bid is ALWAYS forcing to game even if you bid a 4th suit? The answer is simple. In the following auction|CS|4|AT|
^-
{|ia|,1Dp1Hp1Sp2C|at|} 
^-
1H does not establish a game force. It is the second bid (fourth suit) by the responder which establishes the game force. And, it can be established after any openings--on the second round of course.|

^-|CP||FP||at|^C@2^y@3For me, One Notrump Forcing response to one of a major opening was a bit confusing and difficult to learn.  However, I divided the puzzle into several manageable sections so I can learn it with less difficulty. Let me start by looking at five possible hand types after partner opens one of a major and we are playing 2 over 1. Further, please note that I use the generic term of "points" here. I use Bergen's method to evaluate my hand. You may choose a different method. Therefore you may have to adjust the numbers given blow.|
pg| ***** 131 ***** |


CP|8|AT|

1- A 6-9 points hand and 3-card support
2- A 6-9 points hand and no support for the major
3- An invitational hand with three or less card support for the major
4- A weak distributional hand
5- A real weak hand with no features|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


CP||AT|

In SAYC, I raise the partner's suit to two level with the first hand. The bid for the second hand is 1NT which the partner can pass. For the third hand I bid one of the minors at two level before raising  partner's suit. I bid a weak jump shift if I play that for the fourth hand. And finally, I pass with the last hand type.|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


AT|

You may ask, "What if the above hands have 4+ card support?"  No problem. As you recall somewhere I mentioned that my 2 over 1 style would use full Bergen Raises - reverse flavor for the middle range. Then part of my study was to learn as much as I could about the Bergen Raises. I will report to you on my work in another chapter. For now let me work on 3-card support.|

In 2 over 1, I bid the same as in SAYC for the first hand and obviously pass with the last hand. However, I bid  |CS|4|at|

^-|CP||fp||at|^C@2^y@3The part which separates SAYC and 2 over 1 is the invitational hands. Unlike SAYC we cannot bid two of the other suit because that bid is an unconditional Game Force. Otherwise, the responses are the same. One more major difference. The NT is forcing for one round. further, please note if partner opens 1H and I have a 6-9 point hand and four spades I should bid 1S and not 1NT forcing. |
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


AT|

At this point I have to choose whether one notrump forcing applies when responder is passed hand or not. Not all experts agree and there are differences in styles. First, let me quote from  "Two over One" by Mike Lawrence which is a great learning source.|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


AT|

^*I"When your partner opens with one of a major in |cp|8|at|first or second seat|cp||at|, a 1NT response by you is a one round force.  You 'promise' at least six high card points but may do it with less with some special hands that have so much distribution that you judge passing is not right."

"The normal 1NT response looks just like the 1NT response in standard bidding.  Responder has six to nine or maybe ten points and tends to deny support for opener."

"There are some stronger hands that will also respond 1NT.  These include hands with limit raise strength for opener's major but which have only THREE trumps.  Responder may also have an eleven or twelve point Notrump hand that is not strong enough to force to game.  These invitational hands start with 1NT and then follow with a bid that defines the extra values."^*N|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


AT|

Did you notice the |cp|8|at|"first or second seat"|cp||at| part? He and some experts teach 1NT forcing only applies when the responder is not a passed hand as we see in the auctions on the next page. However, I like to keep my life simple and avoid using Drury and others. So let us look at my other option which is recommended by other experts including Howard.

"The reason I recommend playing 1N forcing all the time is it allows you to show many different hand types, including a limit raise with 3 trump, and a weak hand with a long minor. It is very rare that you end up in 1N anyway, so you might as well play it forcing to take advantage of its flexibility. You bid 1N forcing with any hand that is not strong enough to force to game over a 1H or 1S opener. The only exception is that if partner opens 1H, you should bid 1S if you have spades, even if you do not have a game forcing hand. So, basically, you bid 1N forcing with any non-game forcing hand. It typically shows 5-11 points. However, over 1H, with a weak hand and 3+ hearts, raise hearts. even if you have spades. Please note that 1N forcing is |cp|8|at|alertable|cp||at|."^*N|
PG| ***** 144 ***** |

That is simple and reasonable to me. Now, to get a better grasp of the 1Notrump Forcing I better look at a few example hands. In all examples I am sitting South and partner has opened one of a majors. For now my position in the bidding cycle and vulnerability are ignored.|

Bid 2S. Always raise partner immediately with 6- bad 9 and 3 card support.

^C@2^y@3For opener's responses to 1NT I like to review Howard's January 2008 lesson on Two over One.^*I

"The first thing to discuss is how does opener respond to 1N forcing.|CP|8|AT| With strong hands (18+) or intermediate hands (15-17), the bids are the same as in SAYC. With 18+, opener jump shifts to a new suit at the 3 level. With 15-17 and a six card major, opener jumps to 3 of the major. Reverses also apply, just like in SAYC. A reverse by opener shows 16+. So, basically, SAYC and 2 over 1 are the same when opener has a good hand.|CP||AT| However, most of the time opener will have a weaker hand.

Here are opener's choices with any |CP|8|AT|"opener"|CP||AT| hand which is|CP|8|AT| 14 or less:|CP||cs|4|

Some partnerships play a convention known as Flannery 2D to handle this hand. If you play it, a 2D opener shows 5H, 4S, and 11-15. However, I strongly recommend against playing Flannery. I think the weak 2D is much more useful. 2D weak is more common hand and Flannery addresses a problem that very rarely comes up, so why give up a frequently occurring treatment for a rare problem? I also prefer weak 2D over mini-roman 2D which shows 11-15 and a 3 suited hand, 4-4-4-1 or 5-4-4.|

^-|ht|e|va|7|fp||at|^b@2^Y@3The opener's rebids after a Game Force bid is the most difficult part to learn. There are several 2 over 1 versions which vary even in the basic i.e. scope of game force. However, I am committed adopting  the simplest version because I never would be a "World Class" player after all. And for those with higher ambitions I strongly recommend in depth study of material by Mike Lawrence, Max Hardy, Howard Schutzman and others. |
PG| ***** 189 ***** |


AT|

To make it simple I did  cherry picking and adopted rebid options which is included in all versions and easy to understand. I picked  the rebid options with easily understandable logic. In this fashion I do not have to memorize zillion rules such as if a=b bid c or if x is higher than y bid z, etcetera, etcetera and etcetera. I hope that somehow I would be able to finagle a reasonable rebid when confronted with the uncommon situation which I have not learned here. Again the material is in most part from my notes and you should not be surprised if you see the exact text or board in your favorite source.|

AT|

One cardinal rule in 2 over 1 which I like to repeat is responder and opener do not have to rush when opener has a great hand. Responder sets the Game Force and the opener is to answer responder's questions properly so they can arrive at the best auction. Next, I like to limit my 2 over 1 bidding only to focus on the following five auctions:|

HT|E|va|3|CS|4|AT|^-{Opener's Rebids After a 2 over 1 Game Force Bid}
^-|ht|f|fp||at|^b@2^Y@3After a "game Force" bid the auction can stop short of game only when partnership fails to find a fit or stoppers for Notrump. 

Depending on timing, interference by opponents modifies the game force. For example in this

|CS|4|at| {|ia|1h2c2dp|at|}|HT|l|AT|^Mauction, 2D is no longer a Game Force.|

HT|p|AT|^B@2^Z@3

When the opponents interfere (overcall or double) after the opening bid, a new suit at the 2 level by un passed hand is invitational and forcing for one round and a non-jump new suit at the 3 level by an un passed hand is forcing to game.  For examples the responders bid in the following auctions are:

^-|fp||ht|f|AT|^b@2^Y@3In most 2-over-1 auctions, responder is the "captain" because he has more information about opener's hand than opener has about his. When responder has a strong hand, he chooses forcing, low-level rebids to give opener maximum room to provide information. Responder tends to be the "asker" and opener is the "teller".|
PG| ***** 197 ***** |


AT|  

Responder will never be able to make an intelligent decision about the second bid if opener bids weak and strong hands the same way, . For this reason, it's important for opener to communicate his strength as early as possible in the auction. To do it, opener makes value bids that show whether or not he has a minimum hand -- he bids less with less, and more with more. |

In the next section I learn the same concept from a different angle. Again the material is lifted from my various sources mostly from Mike Lawrence 2 over 1.

^-|HT|F|AT|^B@2^Y@3To better understand opener's rebid options based on various hands here is several quizzes. The correct answer (remember not all experts agree) and a short explanation follow. This section again is adopted from my various sources including the "The Two over One System" by Mike Lawrence and programmed by Fred Gitelman. For ease of use I have modified the format and summarized the explanation in a few of the examples. As always, the study of pertinent sources i.e. CDs, books and web sites is a must.

^b@2^b@2Bid ^*B2H^*N. Some experts play rebidding your suit shows a six card suit.  I (Mike Lawrence), and many others, strongly disagree.  All of the alternatives are terrible. 2NT with a singleton in partner's suit is bad.  He is entitled to assume you have at least two cards in his suit. 2S is a reverse.  Even though partner showed a good hand, a reverse still shows real values.  After a two over one from your partner, rebidding two of your suit is often the default bid when no other bid makes sense.  Your partner is not allowed to raise at this point without three card support so you are not at risk of your partner's hanging you.  |

^b@2^*B2NT^*N is the right bid.  The expectation is that partner will bid 3NT.  When he does that, you will follow with 4NT saying that you really have a good hand of about eighteen or nineteen points.  This is just one of many Two Over One bidding tricks that you will like to have available.  This sequence is much better than the solution chosen by some which is to ask for Aces and then bid 6NT.  6NT may be a good contract or a bad one.  Better to show your hand and get your partner's opinion. Again, some experts may bid 3NT here and follow up after responder's rebid.|

^b@2Bid ^*B2H^*N.  Going to the three level to show clubs promises better values.  In the same way that a reverse to 2S would show a good hand, so too does a 3C bid.  The 3C bid, by the way, has an awkward but appropriate name.  It is called a ^*B'high level reverse'^*N.|

^b@2^*B3D^*N is right.  Even though you have a huge hand, the raise is best.  You will get another chance because your partner has committed the hand to a game contract.  (Even though I always refer to a two over one bid being game forcing, there is always the slim chance that you might stop in four of a minor if you can't find a major suit fit and if 3NT is not playable.)|

^b@2This depends on your partnership agreements. If you play you can bid a new suit at the three level, you should bid ^*B3C^*N. Going to the three level does show extra values and you have them.  Better yet, as I learned to play reverse in 2 over 1 then 3C is my bid which is a reverse and shows five Hearts and four clubs. |

^b@2Bid ^*B4C^*N.  You promise a stiff club and excellent diamond support.  I think you should have four card support, but will admit that three is OK if the rest of the hand is good.  One nice thing about a two over one response is that it usually shows a five card suit.  If your partner does not have one, he usually has support for your major. Singleton honors, even the ace, are worth less than you wish.  They do not rate to be as useful as high cards in the other suits.  If you have a singleton honor, make sure the rest of your hand is up to standards.  In other words, if you have a singleton honor and a minimum hand, it is best not to make the splinter bid.|
pg| ***** 240 ***** |


NT|
^B@2What you just read was from Mike Lawrence. However, since I like to  play the "control bids" then I like Howard's recommendation here, "although 4C is a splinter, I don't think it is a good bid, as you just bypassed 3N, which is the best contract more often than not. So, I would bid 3D. Granted, you might occasionally miss a slam when the singleton club is important, but if you play the control bids, you can usually describe the singleton later.|

^b@2Bid ^*B3H^*N.  Do not bid four.  Some players use a jump to game to show a minimum hand.  The problem with that is that your partner has no room to discover if your hand fits well for slam without getting to the five level.  A jump to game must show specific information that your partner can use.|

^b@2You can bid ^*B4H^*N with this hand.  The jump says you have good spades, good hearts, no Ace or king or singleton in the unbid suits, and not much extra either.  This is an important understanding to have.  If you routinely jump to game with many of your hands that have trump support, your partner will wonder which one you have.|

^b@2Bid ^*B3H^*N.  This is a very good hand and you do not intend to stop in 4H.  You intend to force this hand to the five level at least and will be disappointed if there is no slam.  For the moment, bidding 3H, forcing to game, is the way to start your hunt for slam.|

^b@2Splinter to ^*B4C^*N.  You don't have much more than a minimum but what you have is nice.  Your four card support is nice too.  You might do this with just three, but it won't be that common.  NOTE that your partner's 2H bid promises five of them.  This is the only Two Over One bid that guarantees a five card suit.  This is one of those 99% promises that your partner may choose to violate but if he has done so, it is with reason.|

^b@2Bid ^*B2NT^*N.  There is a fact of bidding that some players never learn.  I will put it to you in a rule, "IF YOU HAVE A HAND THAT LOOKS LIKE IT QUALIFIES FOR A NOTRUMP BID AND IF THERE IS NO GOOD REASON NOT TO DO SO, MAKE THAT BID. A 2NT bid here makes life easy on your partner.  It implies a balanced hand.  It shows your range of points.  It suggests stoppers in the unbid suits.  All information your partner can use. Because your notrump bid promises two or more cards in your partner's suit, he knows that you have a tolerance for it and that there is no real misfit.  A notrump bid by you really does help your partner's bidding decision.  That is a promise" --Mike Lawrence. |

^b@2Bid ^*B2S^*N.  This won't feel good to a lot of players who like to promise a six card suit.  But it feels good to me.  The idea is that there is no BETTER bid to make.  I will not raise hearts without three.  And I will not bid notrump with three little clubs.  Since my partner must have three spades to raise me, even though the suit was rebid, I do not worry that I will play in a 5-2 fit.  I would, in fact, rebid 2S with this hand if my spades were even worse.  Rebidding your suit, is the least special of your rebids.|

^b@2Bid ^*B2NT^*N.  You hate to bid 2NT with a completely unstopped suit because you may be in danger even if partner has something in the suit.  When you have three to the jack, as you have in clubs, you do not have to be paranoid about your chances in notrump.  If your partner has a club card, it will combine with your holding to give you a sure stopper.  If your hand really looks like notrump and if you have a partial stopper, you can reasonably bid 2NT.|

This bid is often the bid that gets your side to slam.  Your partner has a good hand, remember, and if you can show a fit, his good hand may improve even more.  A raise does not show a huge hand, but it ought to show a bit more than a minimum. |

{ ^*B7.  Jump to three of your own suit^*N }

The jump to three of your own suit and the jump to four of your own suit (discussed shortly) show one of the strengths of the Two Over One system. Because just rebidding your suit is game forcing, all jump bids in Two Over One bidding show something special. Have you ever missed a slam because you had a singleton in your partner's suit and were afraid to go to slam because you were worried about a possible trump loser?  I know that this has been a concern for me in the past. |ht|m|cs|4|at|^-{ ^*BTWO THINGS THE JUMP IN YOUR SUIT CAN SHOW^*N }

Play that a jump rebid of your suit shows a SOLID suit.  AKQ10xx or AKQxxxx qualify for this definition.  This assures that your partner has a good opinion about the trump suit. In addition, your jump also promises more than a minimum hand.|ht|v|cs|2|at|^b {|ih|psJt4hAKQJ643dK8ct|at|}|ht|w|at|^j   @2This is a minimum 3H bid.

A solid suit by itself is not enough to jump rebid.  One reason that these suits are OK is that Key Card Blackwood should keep you from getting too high.|

^B@2This is an odd one.  It is generally agreed that a 2NT rebid shows twelve to fourteen points OR eighteen to nineteen.  When you have twelve to fourteen, the bidding continues normally.  When you have the eighteen or nineteen point hand, you bid 2NT and then surprise your partner with some unexpected bidding.  He will get the message and will reassess where the hand should be played.

^B@2This brings up the 3NT bid.  It is logical to play 3NT shows fifteen to seventeen with a five card major, but if you like to open 1NT with this range of hands, then you won't have much call for the 3NT rebid.

After discussing this with a variety of players, most of whom shrugged their shoulders and claimed ignorance, I have come to the following conclusion.|

ht|n|cs|4|at|^-{ ^*BWHAT DOES A 3NT REBID SHOW?^*N }
^-
The range for this bid is fifteen to seventeen since other ranges can be shown easily enough. So what kind of fifteen to seventeen would open with a major and then jump to 3NT?  One suggestion was to play it showed a singleton in partner's suit.  This is easy to reject since it means, among other things, that you have another suit that you might be better off bidding.  Another suggestion was to say it showed a six card major and a notrump type hand.  But, since you can rebid two of your major and then bid notrump, this was rejected.  The answer that seems best, after sifting through many opinions, came from my wife, Karen.  

Play that a 3NT rebid shows the fifteen to seventeen point hand with TWO LITTLE cards in partner's suit.  This makes sense because having two little cards is a fair reason not to open 1NT in the first place.  And it comes with a big extra benefit.  Your partner will often want to bid on after your 3NT bid and his knowledge that you have two small cards in his suit may give him enough information that he can choose wisely.|

Jump shifts at the four level are splinter raises.  If you  have good clubs and good hearts, merely rebid 3C and go from there.  This is the only acceptable way in my opinion to play this particular jump.

There are more on Bergen Raises from Bridgehands web site at ^*Hwww.bridgehands.com/B/Bergen_Raise.htm^*N or you can read Bergen's book "Better Bidding with Bergen" Vol one page 37. However, your Bergen Raises skill would not be complete until you read Bergen's new book, "Better Slam Bidding with Bergen" which you can order from Howard's web site at ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/^*N.|

You may say, as I did initially, "I bid slam once every 4th. of July so why should I spend my  money on a book on slam bidding?"  However, I considered it a bargain after what I learned from reading just three short chapters in the "Companion Workbook" which comes with the main book. The chapters were on hand evaluation, Splinters and Jacoby 2NT. Now, first an explanation of the topic by Howard. |
pg| ***** 294 ***** |


CS|4|AT|
^-
{Here is a brief explanation of Bergen Raises by Howard.}
^-|CS||AT|
"Bergen Raises are used by responder after partner opens one of a major and responder has 4 cards in the opener's suit. Reverse Bergen, which I recommend, works as follows. Responder must have exactly 4 card support. 
With 5-6 points, responder jumps to 3 of the major (more on this later), 
with 7 to a bad 9 responder bids 3 diamonds (known as a "constructive raise"), 
with a good 9 to 11 responder bids 3 clubs (known as a "limit raise"), 
and with 12 or more responder bids 2N or Splinter."|
PG| ***** 295 ***** |


AT|

"One of the important advantages of Bergen Raises is the preemptive jump raise (with 5-6 points). Modern competitive bidding theory says it is safe to compete to the 3 level with a 9 card fit, and Bergen Raises allow you to do this in a way that preempts the opponents." |
PG| ***** 296 ***** |


NT||

HT|D|cs|1|cp|4|fp|1|
at|
^-{    BERGEN RAISES    }
^-|
CP||ht|e|Va|4|fp||at|^B@2^Z@3"If the intervening opponent bids, Bergen Raises no longer apply. I suggest you play the following methods over interference. If the opponent bids a suit: 
- a cue bid shows a limit raise (9-11) with 4 card support; 
- a jump raise shows less than a limit raise (5-8) with 4 card support. 
Over a takeout double:
- 2N shows a limit raise or better with 4 card support (this convention is known as Jordan 2N); and
- a jump raise still shows less than a limit raise (5-8) with 4 card support."

"Some people play regular Bergen rather than Reverse Bergen. The idea is basically the same, only the meaning of the 3 club and 3 diamond bids are reverse, 3 clubs showing 7 to a bad 9 and 3 diamonds showing a good 9 to 11." 

"The reason I prefer Reverse Bergen is that you want to explore for game more often over a limit raise than a constructive raise, and Reverse Bergen gives your partnership more room to explore. However, if your partner insists on playing regular Bergen, most of the value of Bergen Raises still applies."

"And finally, yes, I still play Bergen by a passed hand. I cannot think of any good reason why Bergen would be off with a passed hand." 

What you will read next is an attempt to explain most common Bergen Raise treatments in a table. I used the table from Bridgehands as a template and made the upgrading using Bergen's book and Howard's teaching. The treatment for rare hands and situations which would be the topic of debates between experts are not included. A thorough discussion with your partner is a must before adopting all or part of Bergen Raises.

^B@2Now, as promised let me explain rows ##6. In my short bridge life I had many explanations for Jacoby 2NT and Splinter Bids. All experts, well almost all, agreed that you need at least 4-card support. The similarity stopped there. Some, taught no Jacoby 2NT with a void or a singleton. The point ranges were different. Some taught pure HCPs and some used dummy points. The Splinter Bids were not different. The problem became unbearable when it came to responding to both conventions and the rebids.|

Bergen's new book finally gave me a clear choice.  Using his style, there would be no reasons for me to memorize numbers and conditions which easily can be forgotten. Therefore, I am adopting Bergen's treatment of Jacoby 2NT and Splinter Bids. I am in good company because Howard plays both conventions the same way. Let me quote the explanation of the Jacoby 2NT and Splinter Bids from Bergen's book.|

Now, time for a few quizzes on Bergen raises. You are sitting South and your partner opens one of a major. Further, please note that there may be more than one good answer. It is easier to fly to the moon than find agreement between two bridge experts on a simple issue.|

^b@2The original hand from bridgeHands says, "Holding 6 HCP plus 1 distribution point for the Heart doubleton, first bid 1N (forcing) planning to rebid 2S on next bid.  Directly bidding 2S would show 8-10 points - a constructive raise." However, let me quote Howard on this issue, "I really dislike the idea of 1S-2S or 1H-2H being a constructive raise with 3 card support; most modern players agree with me. So, if the auction goes 1H/1S-1N-2C/2D-2S, that shows exactly 2 spades. If you have 5-9 with 3 card support, it is best to raise immediately, as it has both preemptive and informative value." I go with Howard --that is what he teaches. You may choose otherwise.|

HT|e|CP||fp||at|^C@2^y@3Several hands are presented next where we either are responding or rebiding. The theme is various aspect of 2 over 1. However, other situations are mixed in so we would not get bored. In most part we are sitting South and it is our turn to bid. Please note that I have collected the hands from various sources.  Some are from my mentoring session with Howard. Some are from my sources which I have made them in a BBO format. Mike Lawrence kindly permitted me to use a limited number of his examples--aside from the part used earlier.|
PG| ***** 341 ***** |


AT|

Now, let me mention one important points. I prepared the quizzes based on my understanding after reviewing my sources. I sent them to Howard for his review and corrections. There were times that either I did not fully grasp his corrections or his recommendations were different than my other eminent sources. On a recent exchange of emails he wrote back the following, "As I have said before, I am not the oracle of bridge. I like it when you come up with alternative approaches that you think have merit. I certainly have my opinions, but if I disagree with an alternative approach, I think it is incumbent upon me to tell you why. Then, if you still agree with the alternative, that is fine, but at least you understand the two sides of the argument. The most important thing is for you to understand the principles. Then you can work out the details and style to your own satisfaction."|
PG| ***** 342 ***** |


AT|

Therefore, as there are always more than one good answer to any bridge question, I decided to let you know of the alternative approach for those hands. Please note, basic 2 over 1 system with full Bergen Raises and 1NT forcing by a passed partner is the treatment for all boards. In many instances you can run your cursor over the bids and see the explanation for the intervening bids.  Good luck.|

^B@2nome:Let me see if I can get this part clear in my head. I like the simple treatment suggested by Howard, 

"Regarding the jump to 3 of a major vs. bidding 2 of a major, if you play Bergen raises the only question is how weak the jump to 3 of a major should be because;
- a simple raise to 2 is done with exactly 3 card support.|
PG| ***** 363 ***** |


NT||AT|^B@2
- with 4 card support, you must choose between jumping to 3 of the major with 5-6 points, and opener is allowed to bid game with 18+.
- 3D (Reverse Bergen) with 7 to bad 9 hands,
- 3C (Reverse Bergen) with 10-11 hands, and finally,
- Jacoby 2NT or Splinter,
The other alternative is to play a jump to 3 shows 5 or less, and opener is not supposed to bid game.  |

NT||cp|8|at|
Howard:|cp||at| "This is a hard hand to bid. I am not sure I like the 4S jump. 2S might be better. Yes, it turns out you only make 5S, because you are missing the AK of clubs, but there are many hands where 6 makes. After all, South has 20 HCP. And, given north jumps to 4S, I am not sure south should pass. With 20 HCP, slam is more likely than not. So, 5D is his bid (showing control of diamonds). North should figure out that South is worried about clubs, and bid 5S. So, next are 2 possible auctions with the first one being my choice." Let us undo all the bids now.|

That was the bidding right from the textbook. However, let us hear from Howard, "even though 6S is a great contract, I don't like the auction. I think North should bid 4S over 2S, as North has a very minimum hand for the 2C bid. One could make a case that South's 2nd bid should be 3S. Although his spades are a bit weak, his AQ of clubs are excellent cards. That is the best way to get to slam."

^B@2I copied this board from one of the lessons in BIL. But, Howard wrote back, "I don't like the 3H bid with only 3 card support, especially with such a balanced hand (if North had shortness somewhere, 3H has more merit -- sort of the same idea as the auction 1C-1S-2S, where the 2S bidder might only have 3 card support but has shortness elsewhere). The cue bid should promise 4 card support. I think 3C is slightly better." |

^B@2On this hand responder has a good hand and 3 hearts. I think 2H is better, since 2C is a game force. In SAYC, playing 4SF, 2S is a great bid, but in 2 over 1,  2H works just fine.

However, the choice is 3H, because this is an invitational hand, Partner can pass, but can bid on with some extra values.

^B@2Howard: I might bid 4H with the south hand. According to Bergen's method, the hand has 13 dummy points - 10 starting points + 2 for singleton + 1 for doubleton. I think 3H is ok, but 4H is slightly better.

Again that is different from SAYC, where 3C is a weak bid. in 2 over 1, 3C is a strong bid. This is how you can get to a club slam, much easier than in SAYC. Remember, once you bid 2 over 1 you are forced to game, so you can bid slowly if you want to look for slam. If you had a simple opener with clubs, you might just bid 3N over 2D, fast arrival.|

^C@2^y@3Bid is 4S. This is a case where your new 4SF toy is unnecessary. Partner did not bid 2S, so cannot have 18. Therefore slam is not likely, so just bid 4S. You only bid 4SF if you are unsure where you want to play the hand. Here, you know 4S is where you want to play.

You could bid 3S if you are a pessimist.|
