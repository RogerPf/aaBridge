at|^^|cp||at|^bEvery 2 months Marty Bergen creates an animated voice lesson which you can play on your computer@-PC, Apple, or any device having a browser. I have his permission to produce a movie using a short synopsis from each of his lessons. I think you will find what Marty has to say very interesting and useful. His September 2015 lesson titled "2 Way Checkback" is one of his longest and probably one of his best. This is really a very small sampler and without becoming a marketing agent, I strongly recommend studying the lesson and enjoy it. BTW, he discusses the bidding for 50+ boards which by itself is a great learning experience even if you do not wish to adopt the 2 Way Checkback.|

cp||at| Opener has 14 HCP, a 5-card suit, and 2 upgradeable honors in responder's suit. So he has a clear maximum and jumps to 3NT. He can't risk responder passing 2NT. I think most good players would pass 3NT with responder's hand. That is what I would do. |

cp||at|We are now ready for responder's 2@d rebid. When responder bids 2@d over 1NT, this artificial bid is forcing to game. Responder might have slam interest. But since game contracts occur far more often than slams, most of the time responder will be searching for the best game. As you will see later on in the lesson, there are some special bids set aside for slam tries that do not require that responder start with 2@d. But for now we will focus on the 2@d auctions which are more important for you to understand. (MM: We are not going to to report the slam tries.)|

at|^^|cp||at|^bUnless responder's first bid was 1@d, he usually has a 5-card major when he bids 2@d over 1NT. But, as with the 2@c response, it is possible that responder has a 4-card major or a 6-card major. With a 4-card major, opener almost always has good support for opener's minor.|
at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bOver 2@d, opener gets to talk about his distribution. Since we know we are going to game, we have lots of room. So now we can allow opener to talk first. That is different than the 2@c auction. That is logical. Here we have time. With 2@c, responder needed to talk first.|
at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bSo in the first bid after 2@d, opener talks about his hand. Then responder gets his chance. Later on, both players will do the best they can, just like in a 2 over 1 auction. But unlike 2 over 1 auctions, because of the 1NT bid, opener has told a lot about his hand already. Therefore responder is the boss. But of course even the smartest boss sometimes needs information that only his subordinate can supply.|
