^-How To Survive An Enemy Preempt

|fp|2|at|A Marty Bergen Audio Visual Lesson  
^-|fp||cs||cp||ht|h|AT|^k@2    By Marty Bergen BBO nickname mbsez; |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.martybergen.com^*N|CP||ht|i|AT|^b@2
Every two months Marty Bergen and Howard produce an animated voice lesson. Using any computer with a browser (PC, Mac, iPad, etc.) you can hear Marty speak for several hours and thoroughly cover his topic. Not only does he discuss the basics, but he includes many "secrets of the experts" as well. I have found these movies very useful and enjoyable. 

If you are interested in seeing a demonstration lesson, click here |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/dngcdx^*N|CP||AT|. Note that the web site includes some free examples with some interesting bridge puzzles that Marty has created.

I have permission from Marty and Howard to use one example from each lesson to produce a bridge movie. This sampler will give you the flavor of the material that Marty presents and demonstrate his excellent teaching style.

In this movie I chose example hand ##5. In this sampler Marty presents his excellent teaching style particularly for those who wish to excel in Competitive Bidding. He also has "Make The Most Of Your Entries", "How To Play 3NT", "Drawing Trump - All, Some, or None", and "To Finesse or Not To Finesse" which all are superb for improving the declaring skill.  

Hand 5, my pick for this movie, is a 2@D overcall by your RHO. I wish I could present all 42 boards which deal with bidding over 2@D, 2@H, 2@S, 3@D, 3@S, 4@C, 4@H, and finally 4@S overcalls. I hop I can rise to the occasion. |ht|y|at|

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|This is a hand that I would have opened 1NT. It's not a great hand. You do have 15 HCP. But I never like 4-3-3-3 distribution because those flat as a pancake hands do not tend to take as many tricks as other distributions. But here I am over 2@D. I have to do something with this nice hand as long as there is a suitable action.|

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|So I will overcall 2NT. A 2NT overcall of a weak 2-bid shows a hand that you would have opened 1NT. And that is what I have. Of course you need to have at least one stopper in the opponent's suit. I understand that if partner has nothing we are going to take very few tricks. It is not impossible that you would end up with only 3 winners on a terrible day. |mb|2np|

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|That is why people preempt. It makes you consider acting at an uncomfortable level. But what can you do? So 2NT it is. And it turns out partner is able to raise you to 3NT. So let's play it out.|mb|3nppp|

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|We get a diamond lead. We are delighted that partner has an opening hand with 13 HCP. But he also has 4-3-3-3 distribution. We count our obvious winners—one in spades, three in hearts, two in diamonds, and two in clubs. That gives us eight winners. Clearly our best suit, in fact probably our only suit, to get another trick from is clubs. We have a total of eight clubs with three honors.|

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|We are going to win the first diamond trick and go to work on clubs.|PC|D2D8DA|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|It would be foolish to duck the diamond. We can't afford a spade shift since we only have one stopper. So we must win the first diamond. Let's analyze the clubs. If the five missing clubs are divided 3-2 we will cheerfully lose at worst one club trick. That will set up our 4th club for our 9th trick. But what if the club length is with West, the partner of the preemptor? That would not be shocking. We believe that West started with only a singleton diamond. We have six diamonds and they have seven diamonds. East indicated holding six diamonds with his preempt so that only leaves one diamond for West. That means West has length in one or more of the other suits.|

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|The right way to play the clubs is to start by cashing the CK in your hand to preserve dummy's @CA behind West. Lo and behold, when we cash the @CK, East follows with the @C9. The @C9 is a very significant card. The good news is that our contract is no longer in doubt.|PC|CKC4C2c9|SB|SGreat news.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|We continue with the @C3 and when West plays the @C6 we insert dummy's @C7. If East were able to beat the C7, that is great. Clubs are splitting 3-2. The @CA will remove their last club regardless of which player holds it. That will make our 4th club good and that will be our 9th trick. On this hand, since East started with the singleton @C9, the finesse will win giving us our 9th trick.|sb|s|PC|C3C6C7D5|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


NT||SK||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|It would not have helped the defense if West played the @C10 rather than the @C6. We would capture the @C10 with the @CA. Our remaining club spots, the @CJ, @C8, and @C7, suffice to limit West to one club trick.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|Notice that if West had started with a singleton club, which would be very unlikely, when he showed out on the 2nd round of clubs, we would go up with dummy's @CA and lead low towards our @CJ. Since the CJ would have been well placed behind East's @CQ, we would be able to win three club tricks. So this was a form of safety play. It wasn't guaranteed to succeed. |

^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|If East had started with a small singleton club or a club void, then with West holding the @CQ 10 9, we would not have been able to build a 3rd club trick. In that case, I would have tried for an end play, trying to throw West in so he had to lead clubs to me. That would have been tricky.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at| Fortunately, we did not have to worry about it on this layout. East's singleton @C9 ensured that we would be able to build a 3rd club trick.|
