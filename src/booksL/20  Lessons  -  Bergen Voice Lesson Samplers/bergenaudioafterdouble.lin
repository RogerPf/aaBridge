Every 2 months Marty Bergen creates an animated voice lesson which you can play on your computer—PC, Apple, or any device having a browser. I have his permission to produce a movie using one hand from each of his lessons. I think you will find what Marty has to say very interesting and useful. From his lesson titled "How to Compete After Your RHO Doubles" I have selected what he calls 52 card deal. For further information about Mr. Bergen's voice lessons, click this |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/vulnxw^*N|CP||AT| link. 

This sample, although representative, cannot do justice to the depth and quality of his overall lesson. This current lesson has 32 what ifs hands with two 52 card deals. His introduction section is a great lesson by itself. Here I summarize it for you.

^-{          How to Compete After Your RHO Doubles          
What Should You Do?

Introduction}
^-|fp||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|In some cases, after your RHO doubles, the auction will continue very differently than if the opponent had passed. At other times, you can make the same call that you would have done if the opponent hadn't taken any action.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

Conventions such as 2/1 game forcing, 1NT forcing, Jacoby 2NT, and inverted minors all should be off after an opponent's takeout double. This is also true if the RHO had made an overcall. You definitely are entitled to count for distribution when you have a fit--counting for length and shortness.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|

You certainly want to make life difficult for your left-hand opponent (LHO). Once his partner has doubled, he is going to bid (he has to bid if you pass). But, the opponents probably have a fit somewhere, so they're going to try to find it, and it's a very good thing to do if you can make life more difficult for them. In addition, you'll never go wrong following support with support; you'd like to let partner know that you have a fit and show him your support immediately if possible.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|

Vulnerability is relevant, as always, but when you make voluntary bids in suits the opponents have indicated, you need to know what you are doing. You need to have a suit that you're willing to play in at that level even if opener has a singleton.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|

Next is the summary of our different responses when partner makes an opening bid in a suit and the opponent makes a takeout double.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NWe feel we learn and retain the information better if it is explained at a table. Therefore, you will see Bergen's recommendations illustrated at a table. Simply, a hand is constructed for you and you are asked to select to our response after our partner's opening bid is doubled by your RHO. Okay then get set and go.|

ht|k|at|^B@2With this hand you need to bid 3@S. A jump shift at the three level is also weak--roughly 3-7 HCP. You would usually have a seven-card suit to justify the jump when you could have bid the suit at the two-level. A two-level new suit should be six cards, at least. The non-jump two-level responses could be as many as 9 HCP. They definitely deny 10 HCP; that's where you would redouble first, then show your suit.|ht|e|cs|6|at|^p{|ia|,1dx3s|at|}|

ht|o|at|How can you distinguish Jordan 2NT and not get it confused with Jacoby 2NT, even though both conventions use the same 2NT bid and both conventions start with a J? You keep in mind that Jordan, with a D, is only used after the opponents' takeout ^*BD^*Nouble (with a D). |

South is the dealer at favorable vulnerability and should open 1@S. He is much too strong to preempt 3@S. It is wrong to open 4@S with a hand with plenty of defense, only a 7-card suit, and a hand that clearly is strong enough for a one-bid. The rule of 20 makes this totally clear. You have 11 HCP, a quality spade suit, and the length of your two longest suits adds another 7 and 3, so 1@S it is. Anything else would be foolish.|MB|1S|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


sk|w|NT||lb|*bWhat should West bid?^^x|NT|^B@2
West clear is going to compete, even at unfavorable vulnerability. Although some of my students overcall 2@D with West's nice quality diamond suit, I prefer a takeout double. You want to bring hearts into the picture with your four very reasonable hearts. The hand is certainly strong enough. If partner does choose to bid clubs, you can live with that, with three to the queen.|MB|X|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


sk|n|NT||lb|*bWhat should North bid?^^2n|NT|^B@2
After 1@S-Double, North, whose hand certainly qualified for a limit raise, will use Jordan 2NT to express that he has 4-card support for South's spades with a limit raise or better. There is no upper limit for Jordan, but the bottom is a hand that is too strong for just a single raise.|MB|2N|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT||sk|e|lb|*bMake a bid for East^^3c|NT|^B@2
At this point, most of my students pass the East hand. Their reasoning is: "Well, I don't have a terrific hand and I don't have to bid once North bids". But with the East hand, I would not dream of passing. East has a perfectly decent hand opposite partner's takeout double. You know you have a club fit, and you may very well have a diamond fit in addition. The opponents have to have a lot of spades – East knows that for certainty with his singleton.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A takeout double of a major is almost always based on at most a doubleton spade. So East expects North/South to have at least ten spades. Even if partner had 3 small clubs, and 3@C was not the contract of East/West's dreams, there is no chance you are going to play there. North/South have so many spades that they are not going to think about defending. They are on their way to a spade contract for sure.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Meanwhile, there are many hands where West makes a takeout double and doesn't know what suit to lead. For example, suppose West had three aces. So East would like to make it clear that he has attractive clubs and would welcome a club contract.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT|^B@2
There is also the possibility that the hand belongs to East/West. If West had a strong takeout double, which is possible, it would not be shocking if East/West could make ten tricks or so their way. In fact, even on the actual hand, East/West belong in diamonds if they played the hand. If North/South were not able to get a club ruff, East/West might make as many as ten tricks, losing 3 aces and setting up clubs to get rid of their heart loser.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Anyway, I strongly believe East should bid 3@C.|MB|3c|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


at| If your partner has not been leading too well lately, maybe it's not a question of your partner is in a slump and hopefully he will get out of it. Maybe you have not been too helpful in guiding partner as to what the best lead was. |
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In my partnership with Larry Cohen, neither one of us were born great opening leaders. That is for sure. So we made sure that we went out of our way to help our partner lead by making bids such as 3@C here.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


sk|s|NT||lb|*bWhat should South bid now?^^4s|NT|^B@2
Anyway, when it gets back to South, on the actual hand, he could care less whether East bid or not. He is jumping to 4@S. He is willing to be in game no matter what North has for his limit raise. That will conclude the bidding.|MB|4sppp|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


sk|w|NT||lb|*CWhich card should West lead? Click that card on the right.^^Dk^S6HA R 8 6CQ 9 2DK Q J 8 5|NT|^B@2
Against 4@S, West certainly noticed East's club bid and will keep that in mind for the defense. On a different day, that would cause West to lead a club. But with his actual @DKQJ, he is delighted to lead the top of his diamond sequence.|PC|DK|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


sk|s|NT|^B@2
Declarer, upon seeing dummy, appreciates that 4@S is not cold. In addition to a diamond loser, he could lose 3 heart tricks if his side has to open up the suit. The missing @H10 could be fatal. There are many "iffy" suits, as I describe them, where declarer's fate is not well known initially. |
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It depends on who leads the heart suit as to whether declarer will lose the two tricks he is content with or possibly a third trick. You will note that if declarer draws trump and leads hearts at some point, East will capture North's @HQ with his @HK. West will capture South's @HJ with his @HA. The opponents will win the @H10 on the 3rd round.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So what declarer wants to do is to force the opponents to lead hearts to him. So he should be thinking "end play" from the very beginning. But before throwing the opponents in with the inevitable diamond loser, South has to strip all of North's clubs. Giving the opponents the lead early will be useless if they are able to exit with a club without giving North-South a ruff-sluff. |
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So we have a lot of clubs to strip from the North/South hands, and there is no time like the present to do so. Should we play trump immediately after winning the @DA? It turns out you do have enough entries and the timing is ok to play one round of trumps first. As you note, that is enough to remove the East-West trumps. |
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But it is very important to keep in mind that when you do an end play in a suit contract, where you have the potential of a ruff-sluff, you better have trump in both hands. If you are out of trump in the dummy when you throw them in, they can just give you a ruff-sluff which is useless – you can't sluff a loser in one hand while trumping in the other. Because you won't have any trump remaining in dummy to take advantage of it.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You have to make sure you have trump in both hands when you hope to profit from a ruff-sluff. If you are the least bit unsure as to whether or not you can afford a round of trumps first, my suggestion is after winning the @DA, immediately lead a club. Don't waste potential entries. There is no chance that the first club will be ruffed, particularly on this auction. The opponents have eight clubs. Nobody is going to have an 8-card suit when one player makes a takeout double of 1@S.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So here is the practical way to play this hand with no risk. You win the @DA.|pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dA|

You lead to the @CA and ruff a club. East should definitely not go up with his @CK. There are two overwhelming reasons. First, if declarer started with a doubleton @CQ, no one would lead a club to the @CA and a club back to the @CQ – that would be an amazing play. |
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Secondly, that would mean that your partner West started with only two clubs. You do not expect that after the takeout double. So on the 2nd round of clubs, East should play low. South will ruff. He can ruff high – that costs nothing, even though he is virtually positive West did not have one club for his takeout double.|pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c6|

NT|^B@2

sk||NT|^B@2
Regardless of which defender wins this, he is end played. He will presumably lead a heart. But regardless of who leads the hearts and which heart they lead, as long as declarer plays 2nd hand low, with this heart holding he is guaranteed to lose two heart tricks rather than three, based on the wonderful principle that "last is best." When you have an iffy suit, you want the opponents to lead the suit to you so your side plays last.|

NT|^B@2
Sometimes on an end play it is crucial as to which opponent is on lead. With this heart layout – three to the @HJ opposite three to the @HQ – it makes no difference. By playing this way, South will make 4@S 100% of the time, even against the two best defenders in the world, which would feel pretty good.|
