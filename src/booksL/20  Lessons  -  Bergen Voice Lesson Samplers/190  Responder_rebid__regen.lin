at|^^|cp||at|^bEvery 2 months Marty Bergen creates an animated voice lesson which you can play on your computer@-PC, Apple, or any device having a browser. I have his permission to produce a movie using one hand from each of his lessons. I think you will find what Marty has to say very interesting and useful. From his lesson titled "Responder's Rebid - The Key To The Auction" I have selected hand ##8. For further information about Mr. Bergen's voice lessons, click this |

cp||at| link. |
at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bThis lesson is a dream come true in learning how to respond after partner opens. He gives clear guidelines for almost all occasions. He makes you understand the concept, the most important feature for me, rather than asking you to memorize rules which I usually forget as soon as I finished the subject. To appreciate all that Mr. Bergen has to offer it would be best to experience the entire lesson. It will be well worth your while, and then some! Please click the forward arrow to begin a short introduction followed by the selected hand. All the text are from his lesson's transcript unless when it is headed by the Movie Maker (MM). |

He explains and I quote, "When responder's first bid is one of a suit, the opening bidder does not know much about his partner's hand.

cp||at|When I have at least 5-4 distribution with all my strength in my 2 longest suits, I always add 1 HCP to the value of my hand. The quality club suit is another plus 1. So this is an obvious opening bid if I had been the dealer, and it is not a minimum hand. For example, if my partner had given me a limit raise after I opened 1@h, it wouldn't be close.|

cp||at|Before we start playing, it is OK to look at what is going to happen on defense. But let's think before playing. On this kind of hand, even though you are in a suit contract, you must count winners. It would not be helpful to count losers. How many of your hearts are you going to lose? Potentially quite a few. |

cp||at|We can certainly win 4 club tricks in our hand. Other than the @cA, our clubs are all good. The @hA makes 5 tricks. The @sAK brings us up to 7 winners. Ruffing a heart in dummy could bring us to 8 winners. What other hopes are there? Is it possible the @hQ will become a winner? It's possible but not very likely. |

cp||at|Is it possible we can set up a trick in spades if their spades divide 3-3? Yes. If we knew the spades were 3-3 (which is not the case as you will see later), after winning the club in our hand, we could ruff a heart and then just give up a spade. There would be nothing the opponents could do to stop us. But nobody likes to rely on 3-3 splits, and you will see that does not work on this hand.|
