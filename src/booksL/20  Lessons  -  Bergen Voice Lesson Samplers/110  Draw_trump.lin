^-|fp||cp||AT|^B@2^*BMM: ^*NMr. Bergen's audio visual lesson covering "Drawing Trump: All, Some, or None?" has an excellent introduction which we try to bring you a summary next. |

^B@2^*BMarty Bergen: ^*N|cp||at|There are many misconceptions in bridge that hurts a lot of players in their bidding and play. But, in my opinion, the ##1 misconception is that declarer should draw trump as soon as possible. When I ask students how often they draw trump first, their usual estimate is in the vicinity of 75%.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|

Why do so many players believe this? Is it because their first bridge teacher gave them very easy hands where they didn't have to do anything except draw trump and take the obvious tricks? Or, did their friends tell them that the first thing to do is “get the kiddies off the street”? Or, they can't forget the time they went down in a cold contract because they didn't immediately draw trump and a defender ruffed one of their winners.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|

I understand the above. However, on most hands, is it correct draw trump ASAP?|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT| No way. The truth is, it is usually wrong to draw trump first. I estimate that declarer should draw trump ^*Bat most 40% of the time^*N. It would be absurd to say that drawing trump first is never correct. However, there are many reasons not to draw trump as soon as possible. Here are a few of them:|

^-{  You need to ruff losers in dummy  }|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |

{  You must preserve entries in the trump suit in order to develop a long suit  }|

{  You want to set up an end play  }|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


AT|

{  You are eager to set up a side suit which will allow you to discard losers  }
^-|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


cp||at|^B@2
After I explain this, I try to reinforce my point to my classes with the following. The next time you declare a suit contract, if you are so sure it's right to draw trump first that you would be willing to bet $100 on it, go ahead. But, if you are not that sure, you should not draw trump ASAP. |
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


cp|4|AT|

^-{  In other words, when in doubt, don't draw trump first  }

NT|^B@2
On next hand, please think in terms of IMP scoring. So your goal is to just make your contract. Don't worry about overtricks. This is definitely the strategy you want to use when playing in a team game or rubber bridge. Of course, there are many situations even playing match points where you should concentrate on making the contract. That is still the ##1 goal for declarer.|

North opens 1@S.|MB|1SP|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


sk|s|NT||lb|*bWhat should be the bid by South?^^1n|AT|^B@2
South, regardless of whether they are playing 1NT forcing, semi-forcing, or non-forcing, should respond 1NT. You are just not strong enough for 2@H.|MB|1NP|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


sk|n|NT|^B@2
After 1NT, North will rebid 2@C, that's easy.|mb|2cp|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


sk|s|NT||lb|*bWhat should be the bid now?^^2h|at|^B@2
South will bid 2@H, showing their suit. This should be a 6-card suit. Once North bids 2 suits, there is a real chance they are short in one or both of the unbid suits. So for South to introduce their own suit here, it has to be a long suit.|mb|2HP|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


sk|n|NT||lb|*bWhat should be the bid by North?^^p|NT|^B@2
When South bid 2@H, North is not happy. However, they have nowhere to go. 2NT is not a rescue bid. In fact, it should never be a rescue bid. So North just has to pass and wish South luck. On a misfit, you want to stop bidding as soon as possible.|mb|pp|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


sk|s|NT|^B@2
Against 2@H, West will lead the jack of diamonds.|pc|dj|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|^B@2
And South is not delighted with North's singleton heart. And the fact that North only has 12 HCP means that declarer is looking at a lot of losers. |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT|^B@2
South expects to lose two diamond tricks, one club, and one spade in addition to the trump suit. Even if South got a normal split, he might lose three trump tricks if the finesse loses. However, he doesn't have any choice. He just has to play trump and hope for the best. There is no reason not to. When you have a decision as to whether to draw trump or not, ask yourself “Is there any reason not to draw trump?” And, on most hands, there is a definite logical reason. But there is no advantage here.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT|^B@2
And if South makes the mistake of not drawing trump, the next thing you know, he is going to end up with a club winner being ruffed and/or diamond problems when West is out of diamonds.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So, the @DJ is the opening lead. Low from dummy. East should encourage, and South wins the @DQ.|PC|d2|PC|d9|PC|dq|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT|^B@2
And at trick 2, declarer should cross to dummy in clubs.|PC|c3|PC|c7|PC|ca|PC|ct|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT|^B@2
He should then lead a trump and hope for the best. The finesse of the @HQ will win.|PC|h5|PC|h7|PC|hq|PC|h8|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Declarer will then cash the @HA. Everyone follows. And then South will lead a third heart.|PC|ha|PC|h9|PC|s5|PC|ht|

NT|^B@2
When the hearts split 3-3, declarer is all set.|PC|hj|PC|c2|PC|hk|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Once he has determined he only has one heart loser, he can afford to lose the other four tricks, which is what should happen with good defense from East and West.|SK||
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Declarer has nothing else he can do. Once he drew trump and had a lot of good fortune, he is going to score up his 2@H contract.|

NT||lb|*bWhat should be the bid if North plays Texas transfer too?^^4h|MB|4H|an|Texas transfer|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


NT|^B@2
South opens 1NT. With North's hand, he knows he wants to play in spades. The question is, is he strong enough to insist on game? Or should he merely invite?|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT|^B@2
North has a singleton, which is definitely useful. 6-3-3-1 is a better distribution for suit play than 6-3-2-2. The fact that all of North's honors are concentrated in the 6-card suit and one of the 3-card suits is a plus. The two intermediate cards in the long suits are also nice. Too many players do not pay enough attention to their intermediate cards in the bidding.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT|^B@2
These are very significant because they often can be the key in the play as to whether or not you have a loser in the third round of a suit. So I believe North's hand is good enough to insist on game. |
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So now the only question is, are we playing Texas transfers? If the answer is yes, North should respond 4@H. South will bid 4@S and that's that. |
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If not using Texas Transfers, then North would bid 2@H as a Jacoby Transfer. And when South bid 2@S, North would go on to game.|MB|p4sppp|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


sk|s|pc|hq|NT|^B@2
The @HQ is led. Declarer is now looking at 4 losers – the ace and king of spades, the ace of clubs, and a third round heart loser. The opponents, having led hearts, have increased the chance that they will be able to win the third round of hearts.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||lb|*yShould declarer win the trick and draw trumps?^^n|NT|^B@2
No. Don't think about leading trump, which would be wasting time and would cement your demise. This is no time to be drawing trump. What you must do is finesse, even though nobody should like to finesse if there is an alternative. But there is none. Your only hope is to use the @CK, which is not going to help you opposite a singleton. But if the @CA is with East, then you can set up the @CK to discard one of dummy's hearts.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT|^B@2
First win the opening lead in hand.|PC|h3|PC|h2|PC|ha|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Lead a diamond to dummy at trick 2. And lead your singleton club towards your @CK and say a little prayer that the @CA is with East.|
PC|d9|PC|d4|PC|da|PC|d3|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


PC|c6|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Many East players would go up with the @CA and return their partner's heart lead.|
PC|ca|PC|c8|PC|c2|

NT|^B@2
And, of course, you will win it with your @HK.|
PC|hk|PC|hj|PC|h5|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You will cash the @CK, discarding dummy's last heart.|
PC|ck|PC|c5|PC|h7|PC|c3|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


sk||NT|^B@2
And then, and only then, are you ready to lead trump. This has become a no-brainer hand. You will cheerfully lose the ace and king of spades, because you don't have a heart loser any more.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT|^B@2
By the way, what would an expert do if defending as East? Without question, every expert would duck when a club was led from dummy, smoothly as if they did not have the @CA. |
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That won't help them on this hand because, as declarer, if you did get that defense, your only realistic hope is to go up with the @CK, even though, because East ducked smoothly, it seems like West has the @CA. But, if West has the @CA, you cannot make this hand. |
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So your only chance is to go up with the @CK. And, when that won, you wouldn't mind losing a heart trick because you no longer had a club loser. And you would be ready to draw trump after winning the @CK.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Why should East duck the club when it is led from North, even though they have the @CA? |
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Well, how would you play as South if you had the @CJ instead of the @C10? When East ducked smoothly, wouldn't you finesse the @CJ, hoping that East had the @CQ? |
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Even though West could win the trick with the @CA, you would have set up the @CK to throw away your heart. Finessing with the @CJ would be a very normal thing to do. And you would go down when West won the @CQ.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So, an interesting point of defense. Although it does not do East any good on this hand, there are definitely times you should duck smoothly when a singleton is led through you.|
