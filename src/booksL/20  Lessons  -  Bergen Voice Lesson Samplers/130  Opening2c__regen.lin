at|^b@2|ht|j|cp||at|^bEvery 2 months Marty Bergen creates an animated voice lesson which you can play on your computer@-PC, Apple, or any device having a browser. I have his permission to produce a movie using one hand from each of his lessons. I think you will find what Marty has to say very interesting and useful. The lesson titled "Everything You Need to Know About 2@c Auctions" has 42 examples divided in the following chapters:|
at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bA. Should you open 2@c?|
at|^^|cp||at|^bB. Responding To 2@c|
at|^^|cp||at|^bC. Opener's Rebids After 2@c-2@d|
at|^^|cp||at|^bD. Opener's Rebids After 2@c-2@s|
at|^^|cp||at|^bE. Responder's Rebids After 2@c-2@d-2NT|
at|^^|cp||at|^bF. Responder's Rebids After 2@c-2@d-2@s|
at|^^|cp||at|^bG. Responder's Rebids After 2@c-2@d-3@d|
at|^^|cp||at|^bH. Opener's 3rd Bid after 2@c-2@d-2@h-3@c|
at|^^|cp||at|^bBoth Players Are Bidding|
at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bBecause the topic is very important, we have asked for permission to use more of the material in this lesson and it was granted. However, this is just a sample at best and reviewing the entire lesson should be a must for any aspiring bridge player.

However, sometimes the decision as to whether or not you should open 2@c is far from obvious. Additionally, after a 2@c opening bid followed by responder's 2@d waiting bid, the partnership is very much in the dark.|

at|^^|cp||at|^bOver 4@s partner will pass with many hands where you can make a slam. So open 2@c. Keep bidding your spades over and over again. You will end up in 4@s if partner is weak. You have an excellent chance to make that no matter how weak partner is. There is no reason not to open 2@c. You have 4 quick tricks. 'Quick tricks' are the number of tricks you will take on the first 2 rounds of each suit. So the @sAK and @dAK count as 4 quick tricks. |

at|^^|cp||at|^bI am going to refer to quick tricks quite often in this lesson. We are happy to open 2@c with a big hand, but only if it has 4 quick tricks. Of course there will be some other thoughts. I certainly am not saying you should open 2@c with all hands that have 4 quick tricks. That would be silly. But I am saying that you should not open 2@c with fewer than 4 quick tricks. Do you need a little review on quick tricks? |

cp||at|Also worth noting is that we don't hold any jacks. Jacks are often useless, particularly in slams. How did we do in the quick trick department? 1 in spades (@sKQ), 1&##189; in hearts (@hAQ), 2 in diamonds (@dAK), and &##189; in clubs (@cK5). That's a total of 5 quick tricks. You might spend many days before you see a hand with 5 quick tricks. That is a superb number. The bottom line is that this is a clear cut 2@c opener. It is a balanced hand.|

at|^^|cp||at|^bThis hand is not worth 22 HCP. Ultimately bridge is all about taking tricks. At the end of the hand all you care about is how many tricks you have taken.
