at|^b@2|at|^^|cp||at|^bEvery two months Marty Bergen and Howard produce an animated voice lesson. Using any computer with a browser (PC, Mac, iPad, etc.) you can hear Marty speak for several hours and thoroughly cover his topic. Not only does he discuss the basics, but he includes many "secrets of the experts" as well. I have found these movies very useful and enjoyable. |
at|^^|cp||at|^b|

cp||at|. Note that the web site includes some free examples with some interesting bridge puzzles that Marty has created.|
at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bI have permission from Marty and Howard to use one example from each lesson to produce a bridge movie. This sampler will give you the flavor of the material that Marty presents and demonstrate his excellent teaching style.|
at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bIn this movie I chose an example hand from the lesson entitled "Timing Is Everything - Defense" released in November 2014. In this sampler Marty presents his excellent teaching style particularly for those who wish to excel in defending. |
at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bHand 1, my pick for this movie, is a simple 2@s contract which requires two critical plays at the right timing to assure the success in setting the contract. I have, further, used the Movie Maker's magic to hide the other hands which only can sharpen your focus. At first you are quizzed about the bidding followed by asking you to make your plan to make the contract and make those critical moves without being able to see the opponents' hands. Then after reading his instructions you can play the board double dummy. |
cp||at|^*bI wish I could do this to all the boards in this lesson. But then I would be out of my day time job -:).^*n|

at|^^|cp||at|^bI certainly hope you are ready to count. Without counting, even if your instincts are good, it is impossible to defend well. What should you be trying to count? High card points. Start off by counting yours and adding it to what the dummy has. Your goal is to try and zero in on the number of points declarer has and what your partner might have. Also try to count distribution. Very often the bidding will give nice clues. When your partner makes the opening lead, thinking about which spot card he led (if he did not lead an honor) can be very helpful. Keep the Rule of 11 in mind especially in a notrump contract.|
