ht|x|cp|7|at|You can easily switch between   ^*b aaBridge ^*n  and the  ^*b BBO Player ^*n  as the default  Bridge Movie (lin file) player.|

ht|h|at|The other day I played the following hand and was genuinely surprised to find, from the  ^*bTraveller|cp|8|at| **  |cp||at|^*n that a| 

ht|i|at|number of  GOOD  intermediate players had also played that hand, and had gone down.

The only reason I can think of,  for the cause,  is that they must have  -  panicked.

That is enough of a clue  (for now).  :)

Before we see the hand, we need to cover   -   How to use aaBridge to play against Computer Opponents.  


|ht|q|at|At time of writing the latest ^*b aaBridge ^*n is version  ^*b3.1.0.2806^*n  look in the very top left  hand corner to see yours. 
|ht|r|at|You can get the actual latest version at     ^*h rogerpf.com/aaBridge ^*n

^*b|cp|8|at|**|cp||at| How to View the  Traveler^*n     (in case you don't know)

On  ^*h www.bridgebase.com/myhands ^*n  login to BBO  and give the ID of whoever's play it is that you want to view.
 
Click the   ^*n{ Get Hands }^*n   button,  roughly in the middle of that web page.   The next page,  the one with all the hands listed has the  ^*btravellers^*n  in the final column.  Click the one you want to view.

That page also has  ^*b.lin^*n  file links.   Those lin files will play in  aaBridge.   Click one to download the lin file.   The Google Chrome Browser  is very good for this.|

at|^^^^^^
When the deal is showing,  in the bottom right hand corner is the    { ^*bEnter  the Deal^*n }    button.  You need to click it.

then on the left, on the green baize, are three blue buttons:
 
 
^c@2
{    ^*bEdit^*n    }

{    ^*bPlay^*n   }

 ^*bReview^*n               (the  'Review'  button  will start  'clicked'  and so shows differently.)
^b@2
 
 
 
|cp|8|at|^*bYou need to click^*n|cp||at|    {    ^*bPlay^*n   }   and  then click on the |cp|8|at|^*b card ^*n|cp||at| you want to play from  dummy / your hand (South).
^^^^^^
^*baaBridge ^*n  is Bridge learning tool for  grown-ups,  so if you want to look at the cards straight way that is fine. 

If you don't want to use  {   ^*bPlay^*n   }  to play against the computer then  ^*binstead^*n  you can click on


the  {    ^*bEdit^*n   }  button.   You will then  ^*bget to see all four hand^*n   and will need to pick EVERY card.|

So let's start as one should by drawing trumps.|

cp|8|at|^*bRogerPfi^*n|cp||at|    This,  I assume,  is where the declarers came off the rails.
^^They panicked, with confused thoughts of  5-0  'bad splits'  and  @sQJ  to  five!  sitting after the their  poor  @s10 9  in dummy.
^^But 5-0 splits are normal and natural,  they happen 4% of the time,  that is 1 time in 25  (when you have an 8 card fit).|

at|   What is the clear headed way to think about this ?|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


at|^^^^East started with five @s's and West with none.    What actual @s's  did East start with / does East have have left ?|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


at|^^^^All the other @s's are vivible on the table.  So East started with  @sQJ873  and the 3 has been played, leaving ?|

pg| ***** 26 ***** |


at|^^^^We have 2 tricks in the bag and on table the 2 top @h's  4 four top @c's.     So what is the worst that could happen ?|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


at|^^^^East could ruff with all  4  for of her remaining trumps.   How can we stop this ?|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


at|    Easy just draw one.   What then ?|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


at|^^^^We can let East ruff with her 3 remaining trumps,  while we play off our 6 top winners.|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|at|^^|
cp|8|at|^*bRogerPfi^*n|cp||at|   Could this be dangerous ?|pg||at|   We have  5  trumps, she has  4  ^*band^*n  she will always have to trump first.
^^So trump control is no problem.   But we must make sure East does not score her  4th  trump.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


at|^^^^In a sense we are just sticking to the standard plan  -  Draw trumps while we can.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |
