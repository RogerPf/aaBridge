^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

^c@2^Y@3Howard Schutzman|FP||AT| is a teacher and expert player on Bridge Base Online. His nickname  on BBO is hondo717. He has been playing duplicate bridge for more than 40 years. Over the years, he has developed articles and notes on learning to play bridge. This material is presented at ^*Hwww.hondobridge.com/ ^*Nand is available for anyone to download at no charge. 

In addition to frequent free bridge lessons, Howard runs two mentoring sessions each week. The first one is held every Tuesday at 2200 hour in the Main Bridge Club (BBO_IAC) and the second at 2130 hour in the Beginner Intermediate Lounge (BIL) every Wednesday. All times are Eastern time. Kibitzers are always welcome at these sessions and encouraged to chat with Howard. His current schedule is posted on his web site. 

Students are encouraged to mark Howard as a BBO friend and are welcome to watch him play and ask questions any time he is online. He will also gladly answer any questions sent to him via BBO e-mail. He also maintains an e-mail list of interested students to whom he sends these movies  and other materials of interest. You may sign up for his e-mail list at his web site.|

^-{Constructive bidding is defined as auctions with no interference by the opponents.}
^-|FP||AT|^C@2^Y@3This is a five-lesson series on the Fundamentals of Constructive Bidding. Lessons will be monthly in the BIL on the last Thursday of the month at 9:30 PM Eastern.

The purpose of these lessons is for students to learn the concepts behind constructive bidding. I have found that, although many students understand the (often complicated) rules about bidding, they do not understand the reasoning behind these rules. By learning the fundamentals rather than just the rules, a student will be able to more intuitively and comfortably bid, without being confused by the many (sometimes conflicting) rules that may or may not apply. Note that these lessons will not teach any particular system. It will simply teach the fundamentals upon which most bidding systems are built. A student should therefore be able to more comfortably play any of the popular systems. The lesson schedule:|AT|

%%Note by Kia
qx|NOM, A Note by Kia|HT|d|FP||CP|8|AT|^b@2^Y@3Movie Maker|CP||AT|: I made the current and the next four BBO movies in early 2010 based on Howard's tutorial. Howard helped me to update the content to become fully compatible with Bergen's hand evaluation method, as Howard had written the tutorial several years ago. Marge DeFries kindly did the editing. The tutorial stands out irrespective of what hand evaluation is used. However, a time consuming part was selecting example hands and quizzes fully compatible with Bergen's hand evaluation. |
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|

Later, Howard kindly decided to give these lessons and to use the five BBO movies as a follow-up. That is when the question of hand evaluation was reconsidered. Howard even wrote a summary on various hand evaluations. But, after some deliberation Howard finally wrote the following:|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


AT|

"I really want to focus on the bidding aspect of the lesson, not the hand evaluation part. For the most part, whatever method of hand evaluation you use, you come out with the same answer as to whether a hand is minimum, medium, or maximum. Sure, particularly with Bergen, some hands (particularly distributional hands when you find a fit) are upgraded a lot, but that is not what I want to emphasize. I want to emphasize that you need to classify your hand (whatever method you use), and that you should plan the auction accordingly."|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


AT|

So, as a good soldier I obeyed and went to work and redid the example hands and the quizzes fully compatible with traditional hand evaluation. However, here and there you may find a few hand examples which I may have missed. For that I ask for your forgiveness. Further, please send me your suggestions and corrections.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT|

On the other hand, as a movie maker I do not have the constraints of a live session. Generally, I have a slave audience. Therefore, I could not resist bringing you Howard's summary of traditional hand evaluation and Losing Trick Count method which you will see in conjunction with Bergen's hand evaluation in this BBO movie.|

%%%%%%%%%%B01 Introduction to Constructive Bidding 
qx|B01,BIntroduction to Constructive Bidding|HT|d|cs|2|at|
^-{^*BIntroduction to Constructive Bidding^*N} 

In this lesson, we will learn the basic principles of bidding, regardless of whatever conventions or treatments you play.
If you understand these principles, you will become a very good bidder, even if you play a very simple bidding system.
In fact, most very good money bridge players use a very natural style of bidding,
following these principles and using very few, if any, conventions. 
As one rubber bridge player once remarked to me after I watched him demolish
a pretty good duplicate bridge partnership using his very simple bidding style, 
"Match points (tournament bridge) is an interesting game, but it bears little resemblance to bridge".|

{^*BBidding Objectives^*N}

Non-slam auctions have only 2 simple objectives:

1. Bid game if possible, otherwise stay as low as you can.

2. Find a good strain (trump suit or NT).|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


AT|

You may have learned all these complicated bidding rules, but their only purpose is to
help you fulfill these simple objectives. In this lesson, I will teach you how to meet the first objective,

subsequent lessons are related to meeting the second objective,
|FP|2|AT|finding a good strain.

^B@2^Z@3^*BMovie Maker's Note^*N|CP||AT|: In all of these lessons, Howard assumes the reader uses traditional hand evaluation techniques--see more in a separate section. However, he now teaches, and prefers, the more accurate Bergen methodology (again see details in a separate section), but, because it is not familiar to everyone, he will not use it in these lessons. However, next, for comparison I arranged some of the information side by side. |

During the auction, both partners should always be thinking about whether it is still possible to bid game. For example, if your partner opens and you, as responder, have a maximum (12+) hand, you should bid game. Similarly, if you open with a maximum (18+ with traditional count and 20+ with Bergen's count) and get any response from partner, you should bid game. |

(We men, in particular, should pay special attention to this section because we will find it emotionally difficult to follow 
these principles!) Although the bidding is a cooperative effort, one of the partners is considered the 
"Captain" of the hand. The other partner is considered the subordinate (men, substitute "peon" or even "slave" so 
you get the point).|

his/her hand and, perhaps, giving a choice of contracts. The subordinate simply answers the Captain's questions. |

{ The Captain's Tools }

The main difficulty for the Captain is to communicate to the subordinate when to keep bidding and when to stop. The
main tool to accomplish this is the "New-Suit-Forcing" principle. If the responder bids a new suit, the opener is obligated to 
make another bid. Opener, if your partner introduces a new suit,|CP|8|AT| YOU MAY NOT PASS.|CP||

{ Some advanced partnerships even play a convention called "Fourth Suit Forcing." If 3 suits have been bid,  
and responder bids the fourth suit, which may be artificial, the partnership is committed to bid game }.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


AT|

The other forcing bid is for responder to jump (e.g. 1@H-1@S-2@C-3@S). This should be avoided, if possible, in favor of 
New Suit forcing, which leaves more room for further bidding.
In fact, in those partnerships that play the Fourth Suit Forcing convention, a jump by responder is not forcing.|

Note that opener can (and often does) have 4 hearts but is too weak to reverse. One very common problem with standard bidding is that when it goes one of a minor and partner responds one spade, you sometimes lose the heart suit. This occurs when opener has a minimum hand and four hearts (opener cannot bid 2@H, as that is a reverse) and responder has a weak hand with five-plus spades and four hearts and is too weak to make a 2@H (forcing) bid over opener's rebid.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|There are literally billions of bridge hands. But, there are only 38 legal bids. So you cannot describe every possible hand with the available bids. Therefore, what you do is classify a specific hand into a larger group. Hand evaluation is concerned with deciding what group a particular hand belongs to. I will describe 3 common methods for evaluating a hand.|

^-{ Classic Hand Evaluation }
^-|FP||AT|^B@2^Y@3Those new to bridge should start with classic hand evaluation. It is easy to learn and reasonably accurate. I have used it quite successfully for many years, and it works well. |
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


AT|

The first thing you do is count your High Card Points (HCP) using what is known as the classic Work method (the method was invented by Milton Work). You count 4 points for an Ace, 3 for a King, 2 for a Queen, and 1 for a Jack. You then add points for distribution. You add 1 point for each doubleton, 2 points for each singleton, and 3 points for each void. |
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


AT|

Finally, you make adjustments for dubious short suits. You subtract one point for a singleton King, Queen, or Jack. You also subtract one point for a doubleton Queen or Jack. The reasoning behind this is that you may be forced to prematurely play honors in short suits, and therefore they are worth less than if they were in a longer suit. |
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


NT||
HT|e|cs|6|fp|3|at|^-{Classic Hand Evaluation}
^-|FP||AT|^B@2^Y@3Some teachers feel you should count length rather than shortness for distribution. Using this method, you add 1 point for each card above 4 in a suit. Hence, you add 1 point for a 5 card suit, 2 points for a 6 card suit, and so forth. |
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


AT|

Their argument is that until you find a fit, shortness does not help. For the most part, the two methods are equivalent. However, I feel the shortness method is slightly more accurate. For example, a 5-4-3-1 hand is worth more than a 5-3-3-2 hand. However, using the length method, both hands would only add 1 point for distribution. But using the shortness method, you would add 2 points for the 5-4-3-1 hand but only 1 point for length for the 5-3-3-2 hand; I think this is more realistic. However, if you prefer the length method for counting distribution, that is fine.|

4. If you have a void, you have no losers in that suit. ^*N|
PG| ***** 99 ***** |


AT|

Between you and your partner, you have a potential of 24 losers (2 partners x 4 suits x 3 losers). If you add together the number of losers in each hand and subtract from 24, that tells you how many winners you have. For example, as we know, an opening hand vs. an opening hand usually produces game. An opening hand is typically a 7 loser hand. So if both partners have an opening hand, they have 14 losers and, hence, 10 winners. So they should be able to take ten tricks, which is a major suit or no trump game. |
PG| ***** 100 ***** |


AT| 

Many good players are very enthusiastic about using Losing Trick Count. It is easy to learn. However, I do not share their enthusiasm. For distributional hands, it is not bad, but it is less accurate for flatter hands. And, I think it has some major flaws. For example, Qxx and Axx are both one loser suits, but clearly Axx is much better. To be fair, the Klinger book talks about adjustments to take care of some of these problems. The one place I do use LTC is when I have a borderline bidding decision. If LTC indicates I should make the more aggressive bid, then I will do so.|

^B@2Adjust-3|CP||FP||AT| is a method to fine-tune the traditional HCP count for the "overrated/underrated honors." Bergen considers the traditional 4-3-2-1 count undervalues the Ace, overvalues the Queen and Jack (the quacks), and does not give any value to the Ten. He believes the following is a more accurate assignment of the values.

Therefore, he labels Aces and Tens "undervalued" and Queens/Jacks (quacks) "overvalued". Counting HCPs in that fashion, however, would be a bit awkward so Bergen devised Adjust-3. In Adjust-3 you add one point to the traditional HCPs if the number of Aces/Tens exceeds the quacks by 3 or more but is less than 6. If they exceed by six or more you add two points.

^B@2Length Points|CP||FP||AT|: According to Bergen's hand evaluation method the value of a hand increases if it contains long suits. A suit in bridge is a 4+ card holding. Therefore, one point is added to the hand's value for each card more than four in all the suits in the hand. For example:|

Therefore, we should deduct one point for every singleton King, Queen, and Jack and any dubious doubleton. For example, the value of|

Please note that a "^*B5-card Quality Suit ^*N" is particularly valuable in declarer's hand after a fit. Such holding, originally contributes 1 point for length and 1 point for quality to the Starting Points calculation. Then, after the fit declarer adds another point for a 4+ card side suit.

However, on virtually all hands, there are add ons for distribution and/or length that bring the total up to 25 combined points. And even if that is not the case, 25 points is an approximation; you can make often make game with 24 combined points. Also, 12 opposite 12 is the best distribution of combined resources, as it usually means that you have the most flexibility in how you play the hand in terms of managing entries.|

PG| ***** 143 ***** |


at|

As to 4th suit forcing. 4th suit forcing is a convention that only applies when opener bids one suit, responder bids another suit, and opener rebids a third suit. That leaves only one unbid suit. If responder bids the remaining unbid suit (the "fourth suit"), that is the 4th suit forcing convention if you play it. It simply establishes a game force, is completely artificial, and says nothing about the fourth suit. Responder will clarify why he or she bid the 4th suit on the next bid. Opener should try and  bid NT (but only with a stopper in the 4th suit, as responder is not guaranteeing a stopper in the fourth suit) or raise responder's first suit with 3 card support. If opener cannot do that, he or she must rebid one of their suits.|
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


AT|

New minor forcing is a very specific convention that only applies when opener rebids 1NT or 2NT. It does not apply on any other auction (e.g. 1D-1H-1S-2C is fourth suit forcing, not new minor forcing; also 1S-2D-2S-3C is natural, not new minor forcing). Typical new minor forcing auctions are 1C-1S-1N-2D and 1D-1H-1N-2C. New minor forcing asks the opener about his or her major suit holdings. Opener should raise responder's original major suit with 3 card support, or bid a 4 card major (usually hearts).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For the purposes of opening 1NT, I recommend you have no more than 1 doubleton. So the valid distributions for opening 1NT are 4-3-3-3 4-4-3-2 and 5-3-3-2.

I consider any distributions with no singletons or voids as "semi-balanced". Semi-balanced distributions are better for NT and worse in suits. So, the semi-balanced distributions are 5-4-2-2, 6-3-2-2, and 7-2-2-2. Some people will open some semi-balanced distributions 1NT as well (probably not 7-2-2-2 but the other two); I personally do not recommend that.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I will tend to rebid a 5 card minor with an unbalanced hand (for example 1-4-3-5), particularly if I have a small singleton or doubleton in an unbid major. In match points, you do tend to favor rebidding 1N over 2 of a minor, due to the way the scoring works, so occasionally I might rebid 1N in match points and rebid my minor with the same hand in IMPS. But those examples are fairly rare. Most people tend to overemphasize no trump in match points.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The rule of 20 is recommended by Bergen to determine if you have an opening hand. You add your raw HCP to the length of your 2 longest suits. If the total is 20 or more, you should open the hand. For example, an 11 point 5-4-2-2 hand is an opener (11 + 9 = 20), as is a 12 point 4-4-3-2 hand (12 + 8 = 20).|

PG| ***** 156 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is no universal agreement as to how reverses should work. This is the simple approach I use:

1) A reverse forces the auction to end no lower than 2NT. Therefore, if responder's rebid is less than 2N, opener must bid again. If it is higher, opener is not obligated to bid again, except as specified in rule 2.

2) If responder has a medium or max hand, he or she is responsible for making sure their side gets to game. Therefore, with a medium or max hand, responder must do one of the following:
    a) Bid game if possible
    b) Bid 4th suit forcing
    c) Jump in their suit
    d) Make a bid below 2N

If responder fails to do any of those, then opener may pass, and they are not forced to game. Of course, if opener has a max hand, then opener is responsible for making sue their side gets to game when responder makes a non-game forcing bid.|

The idea behind this lesson is to teach the basics behind all bidding systems. What I find with many players is they know all the complicated rules of bidding. I truly believe if you understand the concepts, you don't need to memorize nearly as many rules. So, what I am going to try to do is teach you the concepts.|

I consider this lesson the single most important of the series. If you learn and apply the principles presented here, your bidding will improve, even if you do not take any of the subsequent lessons. I am focusing on what is known as "constructive bidding" because that will make it somewhat easier to explain. Constructive bidding is bidding when the opponents do not interfere. I will also ignore slam bidding for these lessons for simplicity. Even if you are not good at slam bidding, you can still be a very good bidder, because slams are rather rare. Now, let's talk about the 2 simple objectives of every constructive auction. They are:|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


AT|
 
1) bid game if possible; if you don't have game, stay as low as you can
2) Find a good strain (that means a suit or NT). This lesson is about objective (1)--how to figure out if you have game. Objective (2) will be covered in subsequent lessons.|
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


AT|
 
In these lessons, I am assuming everyone is familiar with basic hand evaluation. By that I mean the 4-3-2-1 system of counting high card points and that you make some small adjustments for distribution. I use the classic 1 point for doubleton, 2  points for a singleton, 3 points for a void. Some people prefer length--1 point for each card in a suit over 4 cards (1 point for 5 card suit, 2 for six card, etc). You can use either (but not both)! I will explain in Kia's movie why I think shortness is slightly better. Now, most of you know I really like Bergen's hand evaluation methods. But, because not everyone knows them, I will stick with the simple hand evaluation that most people know.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, let's talk about an opening hand. When you open at the 1 level, you can classify your hand as either minimum, medium, or maximum.|
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


AT|
 
A minimum hand is 12-14 points, a medium hand is 15-17 points, and a maximum hand is 18+. Similarly, as responder you can classify your hand as well. A minimum response is 6-8, a medium response is 9-11, and a maximum response is 12+. Hopefully, most of you know that game requires that the combined assets of the two hands are worth at least 25 points. So, say you are responder. If partner opens, and you have a maximum response (12+), you know you have game. If you have a minimum response (6-8), then partner needs a maximum for you to bid game. And if you have a medium response, then partner needs at least a medium opener for you to bid game. I have a table in the tutorial which summarizes what I just said. The point is, you can usually figure out from the first bid or two, what partner's strength is and therefore you can figure out whether or not you have game. That is what you should be doing on every auction. Although I am not focusing on hand evaluation, let me digress a bit. I deduct one point for dubious shortness. So, a singleton King ,Queen, or Jack I subtract 1 point. Same for doubleton Queen or Jack.|
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


AT|
 
As I just said, on every auction, you need to think about the strength partner is showing. I will be teaching you today how you can figure that out. Once you figure out partner's strength (minimum, medium, or maximum), you can figure out whether or not you have enough for game. This next part of the lesson is probably very new to many of you. I am going to teach you about the "captain" of the auction. In most every auction, one person is the "captain" and the other person is the "subordinate." The captain is in charge of placing the contract. He or she does this by asking the subordinate questions. The subordinate's job is to answer the questions truthfully.  (some of my partners like to lie in the name of "creativity" :) ). But you should not lie. This is very important.|
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


AT|

On a majority of auctions, the RESPONDER IS CAPTAIN. Before I go on, I am going to say something that will sound sexist, but I believe is generally true :). In general, men have a hard time being subordinates and women have a harder time being captain. So, men, once you open, you are the peon :). And ladies, if you are responder, you are the boss :) even if your male partner doesn't like it. Okay, let's skip the sociology and go back to bridge.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next, let me talk about the captain's tools for controlling the auction. The main tool for responder is the "new suit forcing" principle. If responder bids a new suit, opener may not pass. That is very important. You should never violate it. In fact, some of you are familiar with the "4th suit forcing" convention. That is a very good example of this principle. Most all expert partnerships play 4th suit forcing. What that means is, at responder's second bid, if the 3 other suits have been mentioned and responder bids the one remaining unbid suit--4th suit. First of all, as I already said the 4th suit is forcing for at least one round. But, if you play 4th suit forcing, it is forcing to game. In fact, it may be (and often is), an artificial bid, it is just the way responder controls the auction by establishing a game force. |
PG| ***** 171 ***** |


AT|

Remember, responder is captain. So, if you play 4sf, then responder will bid the 4th suit if he or she figures out the partnership must be in game. Responder can usually do this because after two bids by opener, he or she has a pretty good idea of what opener has. later, I will demonstrate with some examples, after two bids, when responder has a pretty good idea what opener has and can therefore know whether or not game is possible.|
PG| ***** 172 ***** |


AT|

We have talked about the captain, and the tools the captain has available. Now, let's talk about the subordinate. By the way, don't despair, I will go from theory to examples very shortly. However, I want you to at least have a basic understanding of the theory so that when you encounter an auction with which you are not familiar, and you don't have any rules to guide you you can figure out what to do because you understand the theory of bidding.later, I will demonstrate with some examples, after two bids, when responder has a pretty good idea what opener has and can therefore know whether or not game is possible. |
PG| ***** 173 ***** |


AT|

The subordinate is responsible for describing his or her hand, so the captain can figure out what to do. For now, assume the subordinate is opener, which is true on a majority of hands. Let's talk about how the subordinate describes their strength. Minimum hands are described by making the cheapest bid possible (for example 1@H-1@S-2@C tends to show a minimum hand. I am omitting the opponents' passes. Maximum opening hands are described by "jump shifting." A  "jump shift" is bidding a new suit one level higher than the minimum required.|

Remember, once responder bids something they are showing at least 6 points. So, even if responder has a minimum hand, once opener shows a maximum hand, you are in a game forcing auction. Medium hands are the most difficult to describe. The good news is, many medium hands are opened 1NT (15-17). That is one reason why I (and a majority of experts) advocate opening 1NT even with a 5 card major. If you don't, you often have a problem describing a hand with medium strength.|

The other main way to describe a medium hand is to "reverse." Many less experienced players find reverses very confusing and they can be. However, they are very important so you should learn about them if you can. Otherwise, whenever you have a medium hand and cannot open 1N, you will have a big problem. The good news is, I think I can give you a reasonably simple rule for how you figure out if opener has reversed. The rule is as follows: If opener voluntarily passes by his or her original suit at the 2 level in order to bid a new suit that is a reverse. For example, take the auction 1@D-1@S-2@H. 2@H is a reverse. Opener had the opportunity to bid 2@D and chose not to do so. Therefore, opener is showing a medium or maximum hand because of the reverse. Some beginners will make the 2@H bid with a minimum hand, just to show their major. That is incorrect. If opener reverses, he or she must have at least a medium hand. Playing reverses does mean once in a while you lose the heart suit. But the advantages of reversing correctly far outweigh the disadvantages.|

One other thing about reverses. Once opener reverses, they are showing a distributional hand. Opener's first suit is 5+ cards. On my example auction 1@D-1@S-2@H, opener must have 5+ diamonds and 4 hearts. You may think that makes some hands unbiddable but actually it turns out that is not true. Remember with a flat 15-17 you open 1N and with a strong balanced hand 18+, you rebid 2N. So, if you reverse, you have to have an unbalanced hand. Now, its time for some examples.|

^fa) Determine the hand type (minimum, medium, maximum)
^fb) Determine the minimum hand type opener must have to bid game.|

Okay, what do you know, given the auction, about the opener's hand?|
PG| ***** 186 ***** |


AT|
 
As (responder), you know that opener has a minimum hand. But you know a lot more. And this is where many less experienced people don't realize what they know. You know that opener has at most 3 hearts. With 4 hearts opener would have raised. You also know opener does not have 4 spades. Because opener would bid 1S. These are all "negative inferences." By that I mean, assuming your partner bids correctly, you know almost as much (sometimes more) from what partner did NOT bid as you know from what they bid. You know a few other things as well. Partner has 4 or 5 diamonds and partner almost always has 3 or 4 clubs. Granted, partner could have 3 spades 3 hearts 5 diamonds and 2 clubs. But more often than not, partner tends to have at least a few clubs.|
PG| ***** 187 ***** |

The other question is, as responder, when should you bid game? The answer is, only if you have a maximum response. If you have a minimum or medium response you should stay below game, and try and keep the contract as low as possible. Next is another bidding sequence.|
PG| ***** 188 ***** |

1@D-1@h-2@D
What do we know about opener? Yes, opener has a minimum hand. Opener does not have 4 hearts--would raise hearts. Opener does not have 4 spades--would bid 1S. And in general, opener has a six card diamond suit. Opener would tend to bid 1N with a 5-3-3-2 pattern. Further, opener did not choose to bid 2C, meaning not 4 clubs. So, basically partner just about always has six diamonds because there are alternative bids available for most hands with 5 diamonds. and partner did not choose any alternative. The other question is when should responder consider game? And the answer is, only with a maximum hand. Let us try another auction.|

1@D-1@S-3@D
What strength hand for opener?
This absolutely shows exactly a medium hand. It is not game forcing. It shows 15-bad 18. So, opener has a medium hand. Opener does not have 4 hearts because with 4 hearts and 5+ diamonds, opener can reverse by bidding 2H. Opener of course does not have 4 spades because would bid 3S with a 4-card spade suit.

This sequence officially shows a six card diamond suit. Occasionally, with a good 5 card suit and 2-2-5-4 distribution, partner may choose to bid 3D. Remember with any 5-3-3-2 15-17 hand, opener would open 1N. That is why this auction pretty much guarantees 6D. Again, if you understand and think about all the alternatives, you can figure out why certain bids show certain distributions. But you have to remember to think about what was NOT bid as well as what was bid. Next auction.|

What strength is opener showing?
Remember, South voluntarily went past 2 diamonds so it is a reverse. Now just to make it clear a reverse unfortunately is not completely precise. It does show at least a medium hand but you can also reverse with a maximum hand. So, in terms of points, you know opener has a minimum of 16 or so, but you are not sure what the maximum opener has. Opener's hand can either be medium or maximum.
 
You also know opener has 4 hearts and does not have 4 spades (no raise). Opener must have 5+ diamonds. Remember, when you reverse, you are showing 5+ cards in your first bid suit. If opener had 4 diamonds and 4 hearts and a medium hand, would have opened 1N. And with a maximum hand, would jump to 2N. That is why a reverse always shows 5+ in the first suit  because there are alternative bids available with more balanced medium and maximum hands.|

^-|cp||FP||ht|f|at|^B@2^Y@3Now let's talk about responder. First of all, a reverse is a one round force. If you, as responder, have at least a medium hand, you must make sure you get to game. However, even with a medium hand, game is possible as opener might have a maximum. So, that is why responder may not pass a reverse.|
PG| ***** 192 ***** |


AT|

We already talked about how new suits by responder force opener. This is a case where opener forces responder. Reverses are a one round force for responder. Jump shifts establish a game force. Unfortunately, reverse auctions can be complicated, because it turns out, it is not clear who is captain.|
PG| ***** 193 ***** |


AT|
 
I use a simple rule for reverse auctions. As responder, if you have a medium hand, and therefore know you must be in game either bid game if you know where you want to play it. Or if you don't know where you want to play it, bid 4sf with a medium hand to establish a game force.|
PG| ***** 194 ***** |


AT|

So, as responder, if you make any bid but 4sf or a game bid, you are not forcing to game. You are turning the captaincy back to opener. with a maximum, opener is responsible for bidding game. That is why reverses are difficult auctions. However, my other rule is "if you are not sure if a bid is forcing, assume it is." Therefore, if you are not sure whether or not to bid game, bid it. In the long run you will come out ahead.|

What does opener have in strength?
Yes a jump shift, showing a maximum hand and establishing a game force. A jump shift guarantees a maximum and establishes a game force. Remember, you may now not pass below game.

Let's talk about distribution. Opener does not have 4 hearts (did not reverse to 2H). Opener does not have 4 spades (did not bid 4S or splinter). Opener usually has 4 clubs and opener always has at least 5 diamonds.
 
Yes opener could have 3 spades. You can raise 1S to 2S with 3 card support. But you cannot make a jump raise in spades without 4-card support. It is time to summarize the purpose of these examples. The purpose is to get you thinking about what partner has on every auction. Many players only focus on bidding their own cards. They never stop to think about what partner is showing. But bridge is a partnership game and partner is giving you information with every bid. You should take advantage of that information it will often help you make the right choice of bids. And remember the negative inferences (what partner did not bid) as well as the positive inferences. Next, let's look at a few auctions to wrap things up. 

Next, are several hands you might have as opener, with several partial auctions. What is your next bid? |

1@D-1@S-?

What should opener bid and why?
I like 2D best, but 1N would be chosen by many people, including some experts. Some people play 2D guarantees six but I find that awkward, as this hand illustrates. What you should not do ever is bid 2@H. 2@H is a reverse, and your hand is not strong enough for a reverse. So, your only 2 choices are 1N or 2D.|

What should you bid?
Yes, on this hand you have a medium hand, good enough to reverse to 2@H even though you only have 15 HCP, you have a wonderful diamond suit, and a very good heart suit.|

1@D-1@S-?

Some people would bid 1N here but that is not nearly as informative as 2C.  2C is the clear choice in my opinion. The next hand is not clear cut.|

1@D-1@S-?

We can take a vote. There are at least 2 good choices. First of all, this qualifies as a medium hand. That means that you cannot jump shift. Therefore 3C is an overbid. However 2C is a bit of an underbid although that is one reasonable choice. I would personally choose 3D. I am lying about my diamond length but I have an awfully good 5 card suit. So, I am willing to lie a little about length in favor of showing my strength. The one bid you should not make is 3C as you are too weak to force to game. |

Pass. Partner has not made a forcing bid (in fact, it is a "close out" bid; you must pass). Remember, partner is the captain and is responsible for choosing the final. Okay, last hand.|
PG| ***** 201 ***** |

@Sxx@Hxx@DAKQxx@CAKJx

This is a clear maximum hand hence you must jump shift to show a maximum  and 3C is the clear cut bid.|
