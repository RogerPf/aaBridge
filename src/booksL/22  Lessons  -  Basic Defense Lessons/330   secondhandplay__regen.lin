at|^^|cp||at|^bOne of the most common defensive errors less experienced players make is to not train themselves to play second hand low smoothly and quickly. There are few exceptions to this rule. The main exception you should keep in mind is that it is ok to play second hand high to win the trick when it is the setting trick (or your side can cash the setting tricks). But other than that, if you always play second hand low smoothly, it will gain you far more tricks than it will lose you. So it is very important that you train yourself to smoothly duck when you are second hand to a trick.|

at|^b@2|at|^^|cp||at|^bThere is a fairly common situation. Declarer is missing the queen and can finesse either opponent for it. But he has no idea which opponent to finesse. So he will try to have the defense help him by leading an honor from his hand, hoping that an inexperienced defender@-not one of us of course@-will cover with the queen, thereby eliminating the guess.|

at|^^|cp||at|^bIf West covers the @hJ, South will take all the heart tricks, since West conveniently told him where the @hQ was located. But if West plays low smoothly, most declarers will assume that East must have the @hQ (otherwise West would have at least hesitated). He will therefore win the @hA in dummy and finesse East for the HQ, thereby losing a heart trick that he would  not have lost against a less experienced defender.|

at|^^|cp||at|^bI am sure you have noticed something interesting about the lead of an honor by the declarer. Yes, you guessed right. Declarer led an honor and dummy had an honor directly below the one that was led. If West thinks as most declarers do, it would be apparent that when declarer leads an honor and dummy does not have the honor immediately below then declarer must have that honor. |

at|^^|cp||at|^bThis is really a judgement call. For one, declarer probably would play the King anyhow. In that case playing low is best particularly if East has the Ace.

at|^^|cp||at|^bThere are several situations when second hand plays high. The most common is when second hand is going to win the setting trick. As Howard always teaches, "No time is wrong to take the setting trick." Next, we can see an example of this situation and a few of less common ones.|

However, it would make no difference because East is a very smart player. East already counted out the hand and figureed out that South started with a doubleton @sK and West should have @sQ 10 8.|

cp|4|at|^dYes, second hand usually plays low. However, second hand has to use his judgement too. East correctly judged that West most likely has @sQ 10 x and the spade Jack is in the dummy. Therefore, after playing high in second seat and winning the trick leads a spade to defeat the contract.|

By playing the nine you may induce the Declarer to finesse Dummy's Queen on the first round, thereby making your King-Jack worth 1 sure trick.|

at|^b@2|at|^^|cp||at|^bHere it is advisable, when West is Second Hand, to play for the certainty of making 1 trick. If Declarer leads low you, as West, should play the Jack, which forces the Ace and leaves you with a sure third round winner. Notice carefully the difference between this and the preceding situations. Here the play of the Jack is right because of the threatening Ten in the Dummy.|
