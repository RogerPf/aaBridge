    WHEN TO LEAD PARTNER'S SUIT    
|FP||AT|By Easley Blackwood}
^-|ht|f|cp||cs||fp||at|^B@2Easley Blackwood wrote "The Complete Book of Opening Leads" in 1983. It is a great book and has been my companion when I have back traction where it is difficult to find an disturb me. However, while on traction table, I have tough time keeping track of hands, bidding and his instructions. So I have decided to convert at least part of it to BBO movie as it is a great read. This is the first attempt.|

The movie set up is very simple. The boards with the bidding are presented first. Then comes Mr. Blackwood's comments. I think it is much easier to understand and follow the teaching when it is presented in an almost live setting. But I may be totally biased.|

I selected "WHEN TO LEAD PARTNER'S SUIT" chapter first because as a student of Howard Schutzman, BBO nickname hondo717, I have heard him many times telling his students, "If you do not wish to lose the post mortem always lead your partner's suit." BTW, see the real reason in the next panel before the beginning of this presentation.|

    WHEN TO LEAD PARTNER'S SUIT    
CHAPTER 6

By Easley Blackwood}
^-|ht|f|cp||cs||fp||at|^B@2
We had better clarify what we call "^*Bpartner's suit^*N". We refer to a bid by him in a suit which suggests he is likely to have high cards and some length in the suit bid. Of course, not all bids he makes indicate this. When using the Stayman Convention, a two-club response says nothing about the club suit, nor does an opening bid of one or two clubs by a player who uses such bids as strong and artificial. |
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


AT|

Most of us will respond at the one level with a weaker suit than we are likely to use for either opening bids or overcalls. Responses at the one level to opening bids are suspect, unless later bidding clarifies the situation. A good partner might bid one heart with J-6-3-2, in response to an opening bid of one club, and some of us will respond with an even weaker suit. Suits bid in response to takeout doubles are also doubtful.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT|

Many of the hands used as illustrations in the text have been drawn from International Matches. Many European players, and some American champions, use the Canape bidding method, where the second suit bid is the better suit. The first suit can be a weak four-card suit, or-on occasion-a three-card suit. So the second suit bid is considered the real suit by those players who use the Canape approach.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


AT|

Now let us change the opening question a bit and ask, "When do you not lead your partner's suit?" |
PG| ***** 9 ***** |

The answer is,|

If your lead of a suit other than the one he bid works, he probably will give you little credit, but if it does not work-and leading his suit would have-you might have him so upset he is going to misplay two or three hands in a row. In my classes I frequently give my pupils the following hand:|

This will cause the declarer no pain.|

AT| He can win the first heart in his hand and finesse the ten of clubs. When it loses, if East returns a heart, he can win it or duck it. In either event, when East gets in with the ace of diamonds, East will have no hearts left. |

NT|^B@2
The timing has been gained. After the club finesse loses, declarer cannot bring in nine tricks unless he gets a diamond trick. So he will have to lose the lead to East two times in the minor suits, and East will finally win two minor suit tricks plus three spade tricks.|hc|sjs8s4|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


lc|sjs8s4|NT||up|16|NT|^B@2
West will explain that he had such a good heart suit. In a kind way, the teacher must tell him that he had no entries to his hand, and that when he holds only three HCPs himself, he should expect his partner to hold somewhere between 10 and 12, making it likely that his partner does have entries for his suit. |
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If West complains that he should not lead a spade because South bid 2NT, right over his partner's spade overcall, West might be told that it is better bridge to trust your partner than it is to trust your opponent. |
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Of course, if he says that his partner is not worthy of trust, the only answer is that he might look around and see if he can find a partner who is trustworthy. However, usually it is not wise for the teacher to say that, especially if the partner is a paying customer.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I must tell you that I have checked a lot of hands from World Championships and by other high-ranking players, and I find that they do not always agree with me. However, in keeping with my belief that the results should determine the theory rather than vice versa, I have watched for hands where players failed to lead suits their partners had bid, and I am still of the opinion that it is good business to lead your partner's suit.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If he bid a minor suit, I tend to lead it. His suit will be long more often than it will be short. |
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A major suit is a better bet, and an overcall indicates even a better suit (a vulnerable overcall at the two level practically demands the lead of that suit). |
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I must say that I have found about five times as many hands where failure to lead partner's suit resulted in a disaster as I have found where such a lead turned out better. Let's look at some of those hands. |

There are some similarities between this hand and the one I show my pupils. Unless East had some high spades, just what did Attaguile intend to use as entries once he got his spade suit established? And as his partner had shown opening bid values, was not his partner more likely to have entries for his own suit than Attaguile was to be likely to run the spade suit?|

Belladonna's 2NT bid was the Unusual Notrump, asking for partner to bid a minor suit. When Pabis Ticci declined this invitation, after Robinson's jump to four spades, Belladonna chose his own minor suit.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You can see that had Robinson started leading spades, the defense would have taken the first two tricks, and no way has yet been discovered to keep them from also taking a diamond. However, as my wife would say of Robinson, he "got caught thinking" when he decided that Belladonna was probably short in spades rather than hearts. |sk||
PG| ***** 53 ***** |

^B@2He chose to lead the king of hearts.|pc|hk|

Well, that was the suit in which Belladonna was void. He won with dummy's ace and discarded one of his losing spades.|PC|hah3h3s9|

NT|^B@2
Now he led a diamond and the defenders got their two tricks, but that was all. Belladonna got to dummy by trumping diamonds. |
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


NT|^B@2
When he tackled clubs, he carefully led the jack. This is correct when there are exactly three cards in the suit missing and they are precisely the king, ten, and a small one. It went jack, king, ace, and when Robinson showed out, it became a simple matter to go back to the dummy by trumping another diamond and finesse against Jordan's ten of clubs.|

Later in that same 1963 World Championship, Robinson and Jordan were the beneficiaries of their opponent's refusal to lead the suit bid by partner, rather than the victims of their own decision not to do so.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Maybe Calvente's decision not to lead his partner's suit was based on the fact that, in the system they were playing, his partner could have opened a three-card diamond suit. As a matter of fact, he had opened a six-card diamond suit. Had Calvente led the ten of diamonds, Robinson would not have had a chance.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Instead, Calvente decided to lead his own suit, even though he had no entry. He led the four of hearts.|hc|h4|at| Robinson was able to get six club tricks established almost immediately, and the way the play actually went, he ended up taking eleven tricks by end-playing Rocchi.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


LC|h4|NT|^B@2
With the ten of diamonds opening lead, |HC|DT|AT|the defenders would have established their suit before Robinson knocked out the ace of clubs. If the king was not played from dummy, Rocchi could simply let South win with the queen, and then when he got the lead in one of the black suits, he could take five diamond tricks.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In the more likely event that dummy played the king of diamonds at trick one, Rocchi would win the ace and simply continue with the diamond jack. If Robinson took the second diamond lead with the queen, he would have to give up the lead in clubs, at which point the defenders would take five diamonds and a club. |

A year later, Robinson and Jordan were back in the World Championship, and this time we find them carefully opening their partner's suit in a deal against the United Arab Republic (Egypt was United Arab Republic then). This time, the partner's bid was an overcall. It is interesting to note that Robinson overcalled on a four-card suit, while Mrs. Awad, of the Egyptian team, declined to do so. Let's look at the 2 results.|

In the closed room (in this deal), the Egyptian couple did not enter the bidding at all, and Bob Hamman and Don Krauss somehow managed to get to a six-diamond contract. Mr. Awad, West, had nothing to guide him for his opening lead, and he chose a club. Krauss won in his own hand, pulled trumps, went to the dummy with the king of clubs, and quickly threw away three losing spades on dummy's three good hearts. He ended up losing just one spade trick.|

In the open room, we find Omar Sharif taking a leave-of-absence from movie making to represent his country in the World Championship. Arthur Robinson overcalled one spade on his excellent four-card suit at favorable vulnerability. Jordan opened the eight of spades |HC|S8|AT|and Robinson took the first three tricks. |
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


LC|S8|NT|^B@2
He then led a fourth spade, on which Zananiri had to follow suit, and Jordan was able to take a trick with his six of diamonds. So, where the overcall was not made to suggest a lead, the declarer was able to make a small slam, while in the other room where an overcall was made, the declarer was set two tricks in a game contract.|

With the opening spade lead, Mark Feldman saw some chance for developing the twelfth trick. Preparing for a throwing against East, he did not win the opening lead in the dummy, but instead trumped it in his hand. |
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Next he led the king of clubs and then a club to the ace. Now he took the ace and king of spades, and on these two cards he discarded one club and one diamond. Having no clubs left in his hand, he now led a club from the dummy. Joe Silver could not profit by trumping that with his singleton ace, so just discarded as Feldman trumped it.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT|^B@2
At long last, declarer led a trump. Silver won this, but he was end-played. If he led a spade, Feldman would discard a second diamond from his hand while trumping in the dummy. Therefore, Silver led a diamond, but Feldman won the queen in his hand, pulled the last trump, and all the cards in his hand were good. He lost only one trick to the ace of trumps.|

NT|^B@2
Jeremy Flint, West, found a way which I am not going to recommend to discover what his partner's suit was. The Chinese players were playing the Precision Club System. South opened with one club to show a strong hand. Flint made a strange jump overcall of two diamonds. Huang's double said that he had from five to eight HCPs. |
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Tai, South, passed, thinking that two diamonds doubled was just a lovely place to play the hand. Flint redoubled, saying, "Partner, will you please pick the suit", and Jonathan Cansino picked spades. From there on, the Chinese went on helter-skelter to a 3NT contract.|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Flint led the two of the suit he had requested his partner to bid. The defense promptly took four spade tricks. On the last spade trick, South discarded a heart and Flint discarded the eight of hearts. Cansino then led the two of hearts. Tai believed what they said about hearts, and won his ace. |
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Unless the jack of diamonds was a singleton, he was going to have some transportation troubles getting back and forth. He laid down the ace of diamonds and nothing good happened. He tried another diamond. When the suit didn't split, he led the ace of clubs and a small heart towards the dummy. |
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That left him with the singleton queen of hearts. Flint went up with his king and promptly led back a heart, putting Tai right back in his own hand. Tai finally had to concede a diamond trick for down two.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Of course, there are hands where leading something other than the suit your partner has bid is the winning opening lead. I can make up dozens of them. The trouble is that they don't appear too often in real life, and they are hard for the opening leader to find. No one should ever play bridge by formula.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT|^B@2
When you are convinced that another lead is called for, it is not necessary for me to tell you to go ahead and make that other lead. You are going to do it anyway. I can only tell you that players who are good enough to compete for the world championship don't do very well when they lead suits other than those their partners have bid.|
