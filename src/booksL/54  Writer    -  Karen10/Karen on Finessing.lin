In the first 3 finesse sessions we've discussed the DIRECT finesse.
I will refer to the DIRECT finesse as:
A finesse that can gain a trick WITHOUT losing the lead, as long as the card we finesse against is "onside"
In it's most basic form it looks like this:
North
@s AQ

South
@s xx

To gain an extra trick in the spade suit, we lead a low card from south TOWARDS the Q in the hope she gains the trick.
This would be when west here holds the @sK, we have the K "surrounded" with our tenace.

Or it may look like this:

North
@h A765

South
@h QJ10(9)  

We can lead an honor form South (we can "afford" the honor being covered by west), 
and as long as west holds the @hK we can capture it.
Again, the K is "surrounded".

The hand out for the third sessions shows another Finesse layout we may encounter: The 2-Way Finesse
Here it is again:  Looking at the @c-suit in ISOLATION:

We hold:

                @c AK94
                             
                @c Q1062


When the suit splits 3-2 in the opponent’s hands, we can not go wrong.
We will always take 4 tricks in this suit, no matter how we play the suit.

In a hand it would look like this:|

If we find the @sK "onside" (in east here), that would be 2 extra spade tricks.

You can try these combinations yourself by clicking on the cards.

So depending on who we want to finesse (E or W)  and our entries and the rest of the hand (do we have information?
Is there a dangerous opponent?   Do we need keep somebody off the lead?)
All these kind of consideration come into play when deciding how to play this layout (who to finesse)|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt||at|
Note that holding the 10 in one hand, and the 9 in the other
gives us the opportunity to “pick”  who we want to finesse against.
(and we play accordingly)
This is called a 2-way finesse situation.|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt||at|When we STOP to make our plan
(we hold up and discover the @d split  6-1 here)
and we DO look for the hair in the soup...and we realize we can defend against both,
Defending against west allows us to take the @s finesse again...(if 4-1 in east we must find @s Kx  )|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


nt||at|Who do you think is more likely to have the 4-1 (or 5-0) IF it exists
East or West and why?   Or is it a pure guess?|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


at|
IF 4-1   (5-0) 
West is the one more “likely” to have   4/5…   why?
He simply has more “room” for 4/5 clubs than east does.|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt||at|As we KNOW 6 of east’s cards already.. they’re diamonds...
he only has 7 “unknown” cards...  7 “empty” places
4 of these clubs?
not totally impossible... but maybe not thàt likely either|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt||at|comparing to west:
west has 11 unknown cards..  11 “empty” places    (you saw 1 @d and a discard)
Can 4 of these empty places be clubs?   
4 of the 7 (east)     or     4 of the 11  (west)
4 clubs fit much more comfortable in 11 free spots than in 7 agree?|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt||at|We can come to the conclusion that IF somebody has 4 clubs
it’s more likely to be WEST
And while we play west for the longer clubs, we still defend against 5-0 in east.. 
by leading small from hand to dummy first.

Next are the 4 hands you played during the session|

at|It is clear that you can not lose another trick
If we look at the @c suit, that means..
You need to play the @c suit for no losers = 5 club tricks
So let’s take a careful look at the @c suit:   5 clubs outstanding: J9875
Do we have a problem when they split 3-2?|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


nt||at|3-2 and all is fine, their clubs will all drop under the AKQ
When you see no problems with the 3-2    then your next step is to ??
check if you can handle a 4-1
So let’s check 4-1 with the J in East:|

IF it exists, so be it, we will not make our contract.
Each and every other table will run into that SAME layout,
