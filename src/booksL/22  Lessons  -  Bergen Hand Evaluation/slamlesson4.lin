^c@2^Y@3Marty Bergen has just released an excellent new book, Slam Bidding Made Easier. Howard BBO nickname "hondo717" had the privilege of being one of the editors, and he highly recommends it.   

He held the last of a free 4 week lesson series on slam bidding on Tuesday February 17, 2009. The previous lessons were on January 27, 2009, February 2, and February 10, 2009 on BBO. The material for the lessons is from Marty Bergen's new book.  This Tutorial is based on Howard's fourth and last lesson.|

^-|CP||fp||ht|g|at|^b@2
What you will view next is my best attempt to bring you Howard's fourth session on slam bidding. Here again, my priority has been to highlight most important parts of his teaching and repeat them often. Moreover, I have tried to make the presentation as close to the live event as possible. 

In spite of my utmost effort I am sure there would be a few errors or glitches. Unfortunately, I cannot afford a professional editor or a proof reader. Please, contact me if and when you find an error. I am grateful to those who did so with the last presentations. As usual Howard has graciously assisted me in this work. I hope that I have succeeded in my attempt. I would be delighted to receive your kind critique and suggestions by emailing them to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.

Last but not the least, as I mentioned, my main goals are to present Howard's teaching in a fashion which grasps your full attention. Repeat the critical points often so it would stay with you and finally get you prepared for his lecture before hand.

To that end, in this presentation as in the last you will find a brief starter on Jacoby 2N as a warm-up with a different twist before joining Howard in the lecture hall. I hope that you would like it. Now, without further ado let us move to the next section. 

BTW, You can down load the movies covering his last sessions from his site at ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge^*N or from BIL library at ^*Hwww.bilbridge.com/^*N.

^-|AT|
^b@2Walking along the La Jolla Cove Scripps Park side walk, I noticed Marty and Howard talking and coming toward me. When they got close, I said hello and introduced myself. Howard turned to Marty and said,|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |

|cp|5|AT|^C@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Marty, Kia is one of my students who makes the movies.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|
|cp|5|AT|^C@2^*BMarty: ^*N|cp||at|Nice to meet you Kia. Join us. We are taking bridge.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |

I was delighted to be with two great bridge giants. So, I positioned myself between the two to hear them well.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |

|cp|5|AT|^C@2^*BMarty: ^*N|cp||at|You are a lucky person Kia to have a teacher like Howard.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT|
I nodded in full agreement and said, "Yes, we are lucky to have him as our mentor and teacher."|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


AT|
|cp|5|AT|^C@2^*BMarty: ^*N|cp||at|I bet his lessons on Slam bidding were great. Do you play Jacoby 2N Kia?|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


AT|
I said, "Yes, I do but many players on BBO do not use it.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


AT|
|cp|5|AT|^C@2^*BMarty: ^*N|cp||at|That is a pity. It is a great convention to use after your partner opens one of the majors and you have the appropriate hand. On every deal, your partnership needs to accomplish two bidding objectives;
 1. Determine what strain (suit or no trump) to play in,
 2. Decide how high to bid.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


AT|

|cp|5|AT|^C@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Kia has heard my teaching, "You should support your partner's major opening as soon as possible." I strongly recommend to play Jacoby 2N (with appropriate hand) in response to partner's one of the majors opening.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |

|cp|5|AT|^C@2^*BMarty: ^*N|cp||at|Do you teach the standard Jacoby 2N Howard?|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


AT|
|cp|5|AT|^C@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, Marty. 4+card support and 13+ dummy points. Also, I teach the importance of the ninth trump. BTW, Marty, recently Kia had a few questions on opener's response to Jacoby 2N.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


AT|
|cp|5|AT|^C@2^*BMarty: ^*N|cp||at|Well, Howard you know what I teach. I prefer to bid my void or singleton before my good 5-card side suit. What are his questions.|

^-|AT|
|cp|5|AT|^C@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|I teach the same method. I think it makes a lot more sense to preserve bidding room, such that |cp|5|at|bidding a 5 card suit should be reserved for a really good 5 card suit and a weakish hand|cp||at|. With a mediocre 5 card suit, I think it makes more sense to show your shortness instead. (You have to have shortness, since if you have another 5 card suit, mathematically you must have a singleton or void.)|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


AT|
|cp|5|AT|
^C@2^*BMarty: ^*N|cp||at|I fully agree with you Howard.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


AT|
|cp|5|AT|
^C@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|In answer to his other question, also I told him  the first bid after a Jacoby 2N is not a control bid. It has a specific meaning, either to show shortness or a very good suit. Barring shortness and a very good suit, you make a bid describing your hand strength (3 major with a maximum , 3N with a medium, or 4 major with a minimum hand). If you skip a suit, it does not deny a control. Any bid after opener's first bid is then a control bid.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


AT|
|cp|5|AT|
^C@2^*BMarty: ^*N|cp||at|Kia, any time that partner is "involved," I make a non-economical bid only when my strength is well-defined. But I go slowly with good hands.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


CP|5|AT|
^C@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Another tip for you Kia is, "Never make a splinter bid unless you are positive that your partner will understand your bid."|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |

Howard was saying something but I could not hear him well. But someone was pulling my arm and then I heard, "Honey, get up it is Monday. You have to put the trash containers outside." That is when I woke up.|

{      Jacoby 2N      }
^-|HT|g|cp|5|fp|2|AT|
^b@2^*BHoward:|CP||AT| This is the final lesson of 4 on slam bidding. To review, the first 2 lessons were on hand evaluation. They were the most important, as they apply to all auctions, partials, games, and slams. Just as a reminder. If you use Bergen's methods of hand evaluation, you need 26 points between the combined hands to bid game. If you have 33 points or more, you are in the slam range.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


AT|

However, just because you have 33 points, it does not mean you should automatically bid slam . You need to make sure you do not have 2 losers off the top. That means you  have to have first round control (Ace or void) of 3 suits, and 2nd round control (King or singleton) of the 4th suit.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


AT|

Control bids were the topic of the third lesson, last week. In that lesson, I discussed control bids and Roman Key Card Blackwood, which are used to make sure you have the necessary controls in all suits. So, we now have the theoretical foundation about what we need to bid slam, and how to stop if slam cannot be made. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


AT|

This week's lesson will be on two common conventions that can help get us to slam,|HT|u|cs|4|FP|2|AT|^C{ ^GJacoby 2N                    }|FP||AT|^m  and |FP|2|AT|^o{                        splinter bids                      }|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


FP||AT|


In addition, I will discuss an interesting and little known convention,|CS|4|FP|2|AT|      {    5N, pick a slam    }|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


CS||FP||AT|

OK, let's start with Jacoby 2N|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
HT|e|cs|5|AT|^-
{      Jacoby 2N      }
^-|HT|g|cp|5|fp|2|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|As most of you know, when partner opens 1 of a major, and you have 4+ card support and a game forcing hand (at least 13 dummy points), you bid 2N to show that hand. That convention is known as |cp|5|at|Jacoby 2N|cp||at|.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


AT|

Bergen recommends that you always bid 2N with 13+ dummy points and 4 card support. Therefore, if you do not bid Jacoby 2N but show a game forcing hand, and later raise the major, you can only have 3 card support at most. That is an important negative inference. If you do not bid Jacoby 2N after showing a game forcing hand, you cannot have 4 card support of the major. A 9-card trump fit is much better than an 8 card trump fit. It is almost worth an extra trick.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


AT|

So Bergen recommends you tell your partner the good news immediately. The only exception to this is on hands where you have shortness, you can splinter instead of bidding Jacoby 2N. But splinters also show 4 card support and game forcing values. Therefore, absent a splinter or Jacoby 2N, if responder has shown a game forcing hand, he does not have 4+ trump support.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


AT|

Now, let us look at a few examples. As in the past I show you the hand and the auction. Count the value of the hand and then choose your bid. I will give the correct answer afterward. |

^c@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||fp|2|at|2N is correct. First of all, you cannot be too strong to bid Jacoby 2N. So even though this hand is very strong, you still should start with 2N. And, by the way, as you can see, it is easy to make a small mistake in hand evaluation. But it doesn't really make all that much difference if you are off by a point.

PG| ***** 50 ***** |


AT|

You should not splinter with a strong hand, 17 or more dummy points, even with shortness. The reason being that splinters take up a lot of bidding space, and with 17 or more, it is more important you leave room for slam exploration.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |

With that in mind, here are two more hands. Again partner opens 1@S. How many dummy points and what bid?|

^-|HT|i|cp|5|fp|2|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||fp||at|It is time to discuss opener's rebids after the Jacoby 2N. First, let us look at a new suit bid by the opener. The following are what opener promises when rebids a new suit:|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


cp|5|fp|2|at|

1.   A new suit at the 3 level, shows shortness in that suit, a singleton or void.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


AT|
2.   A new suit at the 4 level, that shows a strong 5 card suit (at least 2 of the top 3 honors)
^Cand less than 14 HCP.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


cp||FP||at|

Bergen recommends you don't jump to the 4 level with a strong hand, because that crowds the bidding too much.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


AT|

Please, remember, a new suit rebid by opener is not a control bid. It specifically shows shortness at the 3 level or a strong suit at the 4 level. BTW, it has been pointed out that some people play you can bid at the 4 level if your suit has 3 of the top 5, or 2 of the top 3.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


AT|

Let me show you a few examples. You (North) open 1@H, pard bids 2N. Look at the hand and tell me how many points and what do you bid?|

^C@2^Z@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|3@H is the correct bid. This hand is worth 19 Declarer points. Remember, when calculating points for length, you use regular length points for starting points (3 for 7 card suit). You then double dip, by adding extra points for trump length above 5, so you add 2 additional points for the 7 card heart suit if that is the trump suit.

So far my results have been very good using Bergen's methods. at worst, I have bid some slams on 1 finesse.

^C@2^Y@34@D is the correct answer. This is a case where you have to take into account the double fit. If you have controls in all suits, you can count 12 tricks--5 clubs, 1 diamond, 5S, and a diamond ruff, since you can pitch your diamond on the last club. So, you should bid 4@D, to make sure you have hearts controlled. If partner bids 4@H, you can then bid 4N. Then, if you are missing one key card, bid 6, if missing no key cards you can bid a grand slam. Basically, you can picture 12 tricks, since you know partner is 5-5 in hearts and clubs. However, if partner bids 4S, you must pass, because you know you have 2 heart losers.

^C@2^Y@3Great fit. 4NT is the correct bid. This is a hand with a great fit. Bid 4N because you control all suits. If partner is short in hearts, you have no wasted heart points, it is as if you only have to worry about 30 HCP, need not worry about the heart points. So, if you are missing one or zero key cards, bid six. That is really all you need to know.

So, I like to repeat it over and over and look at it from both sides of the table.|

To that end, I have constructed the most common Jacoby 2N auctions for our review. Together, in each auction we try to determine what the bid by partner promises. We are sitting South in all auctions. It is not a quiz. Review the auction, make your interpretation then click the forward arrow to look at the correct answer. As always there could be other, as Howard calls them, meritorious answers. But, let us look at when 2N is a Jacoby 2N. The following are only when 2N is a Jacoby.|

^c@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||fp|2|at|4@D is the correct bid. The singleton Ace may be a concern for some. First, this is still 13-16 dummy points with a singleton. Some people recommend against a splinter bid here. But Bergen feels you can still splinter with a singleton Ace. So, he would recommend you bid 4@D with this hand. Bergen feels the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. I have no experience yet to say whether I agree or not, but when in doubt I tend to go with Bergen's opinions. He rarely steers you wrong.

^c@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||fp|2|at|4@D is the correct answer.

First of all, we need to agree that South should splinter in diamonds. 3@D  bids not a splinter, merely a game try in hearts, with diamond cards. Partner does not know South has such a good hand, since 1@H can be made on 6 points. Therefore, 4@D is a diamond splinter, since it is an "unnecessary jump." As to whether you are too strong. The hand is worth 17 declarer points. However, partner is limited to 16, so in this case, a 4@D bid is warranted, because you are not really taking up too much room. What you are trying to convey is interest in slam if diamond shortness is valuable. Without the diamond shortness, slam would be extremely unlikely.

^c@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||fp||at|The final topic on splinters is follow ups when partner splinters.  As I mentioned before, the best holdings in the short suit are no honors. Bergen feels 3-5 small is the best holding. So, if partner splinters and you have 3-5 small, your hand really goes up in value, because your other honors are working well with partner's cards. Another good holding is Ace with 2 to 4 other small cards. It is not  quite as good as all small cards, but almost as good. |
PG| ***** 201 ***** |


AT|

Bad holdings are shortness, doubleton or less, and high cards other than the Ace. So, if you have those holdings, your hand goes down in value. Let us look at some examples next.|

So, slam is quite possible. the only fly in the ointment is that you might have 2 diamond losers. So, you bid 4@H. partner knows that you are interested in slam, but don't have a diamond control. Partner will bid 4@S with no diamond control, otherwise 4N or another control bid with a diamond control. Therefore, your 4H conveys the exact message you want to send.

HT|S|CP|5|AT|^c@2^z@3I am sure you noticed that Hands 4-27 and 4-28 are indeed the same hand. |CP||AT|The difference is in the auction. In 4-27, the auction goes 1@H-1@S-4@C, which devalues the 1@S bidder's hand quite a bit, due to the club points. In 4-28, the auction goes 1@H-1@S-4@D, which improves the value of the 1@S bidder's hand quite a bit, since he has only small diamonds (the J is not worth much). So, in 4-27, the 1@S bidder should simply close out in game by bidding 4@S. In 4-28, the 1S bidder should look for slam. He can do that by either bidding 4@H (control bid), or jumping right to 4N, since he knows that all suits are controlled (partner has diamonds controlled, and he has hearts and clubs controlled)|

- Partner opens 1@H/1@S
- You have 4-card support
- You have a singleton (it could be an honor) or void. 
- You have 13-16 dummy points. Remember, with 17+ dummy points you bid Jacoby 2N even if you  have a singleton.|

{          5NT Pick a Slam          }

^-|HT|h|cp|5|fp|2|AT|^c@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||fp||at|Our final topic in this marathon session is 5N pick a slam. In the old days, a jump to 5N was known as a "grand slam force" and  asked partner to bid 7 with 2 of the top 3 honors in the trump suit. However, now that we have Roman Key Card Blackwood (RKCB), grand slam force is unnecessary.|
PG| ***** 227 ***** |


AT|

So, 5N now has another meaning. It says, "partner we have slam (obviously), but I am not sure in which suit." Please help me choose. Partner has the following choices:|
PG| ***** 228 ***** |


AT|

- bid a new suit that hasn't been mentioned yet
- to show mild support for a suit that partner did not previously support
- rebid a suit if it is stronger than the auction indicated thus far, and finally
- bid 6N if no other choice seems viable.|
PG| ***** 229 ***** |


AT|

Once partner responds to 5N, you have the following choices:

- go along with what partner bid
- suggest another suit, or
- bid 6N.|
PG| ***** 230 ***** |

This is more an intuitive convention, so some examples should help get you started.|

mb|1np2cp2dp|lb|*BNow, What bid would you make?^^5n|mb|5n|cp|5|AT|
^b@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|5NT is the correct answer. Partnership might have club slam. Here, because you have so many points, you would like to be in slam, but you are not sure where. So,  you could bid 5N. On good days partner would bid 6 clubs with a club suit. If not, 6N is probably ok. One thing Bergen feels is that suit slams are much easier to play than NT slams. He recommends that often you might even play in a 7 card fit rather than NT. The reason suit slams are often better is you generate extra tricks with ruffs. For example, if you have a 4-4 fit, and can manage 2 ruffs in one hand, you take six trump tricks instead of just 4 tricks in the suit.|

^b@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|5NT is the correct answer. Partnership may have diamond or spade slam. 

On this hand, you would like to be in slam, but you are not sure which suit. Diamonds are possible, spades are possible. So, you can bid 5N, if partner bids 6@D for example, you are in a 5-3 diamond fit. He might also bid 6@S with honor doubleton of spades. 5N gives you the best shot at finding your best spot.|

^b@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|6@D is the correct answer. Here you have almost a self sufficient diamond suit. So, bid 6@D, suggesting that you would like to play 6@D even if partner has a singleton. Even if partner has a void, it is fairly likely you only have one diamond loser, if diamonds are 3-3 or the 10 comes down doubleton  about 50% or so, maybe slightly less.|

^b@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|6@C is the correct answer. Here you have a good club suit. So, you would bid 6@C, suggesting a club slam. A few hands ago, I gave you the companion hand, where it had 4 clubs to the AK. Next, if you look at the two hands you will see 6@C is a great contract.|

^b@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||fp||at|3H is game forcing, showing 5@H and 4@S. (If you play Smolen, you bid 3S to show that hand.) Since South does not have 3 card heart support, he bids 3N. North knows they have enough points for slam, but 6@D, 6@H, and 6N are all possible slam choice. He bids 5N. South, with excellent 2 card heart support, bids 6H. (Remember, North knows South cannot have 3 hearts.)|

^C@2^Y@3Movie Maker|CP||AT|: In the following examples please calculate the value of the hand based on the auction presented. The auction will set whether the hand is Declarer or Dummy. Next, please choose the appropriate bid. 

The workout section is extensive. Some of the quizzes are the same boards discussed by Howard during his lesson. The rest are from my lessons in BIL. There is no pattern.

In many of the examples you are prompted to give the value of the hand. For your reference in those examples Bergen's Guideline is available in the subsequent panel. In many others you are asked only to choose the correct bids. However, in those examples right after the answer the value of the hand is given. In this fashion you can also practice your hand evaluation and learn how to interpret the bid by the partner. 

In most instances, you can get what a particular bid means simply by running your cursor over the gray "bid box" to see the explanation in the newly opened window.

Repetition is the theme here and I have made sure that you get a good dose of it. Get a glass of wine. Turn your favorite music on and make sure that you would not be disturbed for couple of hours.

Good luck.|

^c@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||fp|2|at|2N is correct.. First of all, you cannot be too strong to bid Jacoby 2N. So, even though this hand is very strong, you still should start with 2N.

You need a good 5 card suit, either 2 of the top 3 or 3 of the top 5 and 13 HCP or less. This hand qualifies, so 4@C is the bid. By "HCP" I mean Raw HCP. Here, Bergen does not use Bergen points.

^C@2^Z@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|3@H is the correct bid. This hand is worth 19 Declarer Points. Remember, when calculating points for length, you use regular length points for starting points (3 for 7 card suit). You then double dip, by adding extra points for trump length above 5, so you add 2 additional points for the 7 card heart suit if that is the trump suit.

So far my results have been very good using Bergen's methods. at worst, I have bid some slams on 1 finesse.

This is what Howard wrote when he edited this auction, "South can bid RKCB once North bids 3S (although your auction is ok as well). In general, whoever discovers that their side has all suits controlled can start RKCB."

I kept the auction as is because it is a good control-bids practice. Further, it was too difficult to change it in the movie.|

Howard said, "North has the ideal spade holding once South bids 3@S. Since he has diamonds and clubs controlled, he can immediately bid 4N."

Again, I did not change the auction. Because, we can practice Queen ask with the current auction plus the reasons I mentioned in the last board.|

Howard liked this auction but also mentioned, "One could argue that South could simply bid 4@S, which denies a heart control. South already has shown 18+, so North can continue bidding if he has hearts controlled."|

^C@2^Y@34@D is the correct answer. This is a case where you have to take into account the double fit. If you have controls in all suits, you can count 12 tricks 5 clubs, 1 diamond, 5S, and a diamond ruff, since you can pitch your diamond on the last club. So, you should bid 4@D, to make sure you have hearts controlled. If partner bids 4@H, you can then bid 4N. Then, if you are missing one key card, bid 6, if missing no key cards you can bid a grand slam. Basically, you can picture 12 tricks, since you know partner is 5-5 in hearts and clubs. However, if partner bids 4S, you must pass, because you know you have 2 heart losers.

^C@2^Y@3Great fit. 4NT is the correct bid. This is a hand with a great fit. Bid 4N because you control all suits. If partner is short in hearts, you have no wasted heart points, it is as if you only have to worry about 30 HCP, need not worry about the heart points. So, if you are missing one or zero key cards, bid six. That is really all you need to know.

^c@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||fp|2|at|4@D is the correct bid. The singleton Ace may be a concern for some. First, this is still 13-16 dummy points with a singleton. Some people recommend against a splinter bid here. But Bergen feels you can still splinter with a singleton Ace. So, he would recommend you bid 4@D with this hand. Bergen feels the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. I have no experience yet to say whether I agree or not, but when in doubt I tend to go with Bergen's opinions. He rarely steers you wrong.

^c@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||fp|2|at|4@D is the correct answer.

First of all, we need to agree that South should splinter in diamonds. 3@D  bids not a splinter, merely a game try in hearts, with diamond cards. Partner does not know South has such a good hand, since 1@H can be made on 6 points. Therefore, 4@D is a diamond splinter, since it is an "unnecessary jump." As to whether you are too strong. The hand is worth 17 Declarer points. However, partner is limited to 16, so in this case, a 4@D bid is warranted, because you are not really taking up too much room. What you are trying to convey is interest in slam if diamond shortness is valuable. Without the diamond shortness, slam would be extremely unlikely.

^c@2^y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|4@h is the correct answer. First remember that 4C means pard has 4 spades, 20+ dummy points, and club shortness. So, slam is quite possible. the only fly in the ointment is that you might have 2 diamond losers. So, you bid 4@H. partner knows that you are interested in slam, but don't have a diamond control. Partner will bid 4@S with no diamond control, otherwise 4N or another control bid with a diamond control. Therefore, your 4H conveys the exact message you want to send.

Any bid below game by South (e.g. 3D or 3H) is simply a game try). Therefore, to initiate a control bid sequence, South must bid past 3S. In this case he bids 4C, his cheapest control. If he had a diamond control but not a club control, he would bid 4D.|

HT|S|CP|5|AT|^B@2^Y@3I am sure you noticed that Hands 4-27 and 4-28 are indeed the same hand. |CP||AT|The difference is in the auction. In 4-27, the auction goes 1@H-1@S-4@C, which devalues the 1@S bidder's hand quite a bit, due to the club points. In 4-28, the auction goes 1@H-1@S-4@D, which improves the value of the 1@S bidder's hand quite a bit, since he has only small diamonds (the J is not worth much). So, in 4-27, the 1@S bidder should simply close out in game by bidding 4@S. In 4-28, the 1S bidder should look for slam. He can do that by either bidding 4@H (control bid), or jumping right to 4N, since he knows that all suits are controlled (partner has diamonds controlled, and he has hearts and clubs controlled)|

^b@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|5NT is the correct answer. Partnership might have club slam. Here, because you have so many points, you would like to be in slam, but you are not sure where. So,  you could bid 5N. On good days partner would bid 6 clubs with a club suit. If not, 6N is probably ok. One thing Bergen feels is that suit slams are much easier to play than NT slams. He recommends that often you might even play in a 7 card fit rather than NT. The reason suit slams are often better is you generate extra tricks with ruffs. For example, if you have a 4-4 fit, and can manage 2 ruffs in one hand, you take six trump tricks instead of just 4 tricks in the suit.|

on this hand, you would like to be in slam, but you are not sure which suit. Diamonds are possible, spades are possible. So you can bid 5N, if partner bids 6@D for example, you are in a 5-3 diamond fit. He might also bid 6@S with honor doubleton of spades. So 5N gives you the best shot at finding your best spot.|

Even if partner has a void, it is fairly likely you only have one diamond loser, if diamonds are 3-3 or the 10 comes down doubleton  about 50% or so, maybe slightly less.|

Howard agreed with the above bidding and had another bidding suggestion after 5NT.  I have the same board with his suggested bidding next. Also read his commentary.|

^b@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||fp||at|North can either pass or bid 6N (both contracts make). The 3@D bid shows diamonds and a possible slam try. 3N denies 4 diamonds and 3 hearts. 6@D shows good 3 card diamond support.|

No I did not make a mistake. This is exactly how the hand is in the book. There is an obvious club holding change. Next read Howard's opinion. No wonder I always give high boards to the opponents.|mb|6c|an|Just did|

^b@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||fp||at|I am not sure if South should bid 6@C or 6@D, although obviously 6@C is better than 6@D. I think 6@D is actually the better bid on this auction.
