CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^Y@3Louis H. WATSON|FP||AT| died on St. Valentine's Day in 1938, when contract bridge was in its infancy and Mr. Watson was one of its youngest stars. 29 years old and already a tournament Veteran ranked in or near the top ten players.

For some reason, not surely ascertainable, Louis Watson almost immediately became a bridge legend. Around bridge` clubs and tournaments his name is still heard far more often than those of the departed bridge game of those early days, such as Milton Work and Wilbur Whitehead.

Furthermore. Watson's principal book and enduring bridge monument, "Watson on the Play of the Hand," is literally the only bridge book that has remained in continuous demand from the date of its publication (early 1934) into the present day. The book itself presents a curious question. The first printing was 4,000 copies and there was a second printing of 4,000 copies and those 8,000 copies were all that were sold.

- nome|cp||at|: There is hardly much written about Louis H. Watson. What you read above is part of an article from New York Times from April 20, 1958. Yes, over 51 years ago. I had to purchase the one page article online. It was to announce the printing of the new edition of his book, "^*IWatson on the Play of the Hand^*N." That edition was enlarged and modernized by Sam Fry. Jr.--one of Watson's partner. You can read the entire article, a teaching gem by itself, at the end of this presentation. |

Chapter on End Plays is in Part II, ^*IAdvanced Play and Expert Technique^*N, and I will not get to it before this fall. However, I could not resist combining teachings of the two bridge experts I revere most when I heard Howard is doing a lesson on End Plays based on Marty Bergen's book, "^*IDeclarer Play the Bergen Way.^*N"|

In this presentation, I have used the boards from Watson's End Plays chapter as a supplement and a comprehensive workout. Each board is a gem and very instructive. They perfectly fit with Howard's excellent explanation of the topic. The boards, unlike the book, are arranged in a closed format to enhance their teaching messages. I hope that you enjoy viewing this presentation and learn from it as much as I did preparing it.|

CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^Y@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :
^D* For beginner bridge players to escape to
^D* Where we could have teachers come and give lessons without interference from Advanced players
^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice
^D* For the beginner to go to and have one on one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions

In 2001/2/3  there was nowhere for that to happen and so in September 2003 Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began.

Nowadays there are lessons and tournaments  for BIL members to take part in every day of the year. All members can apply to have a mentor if they wish to do so and every endeavor is made to find one for them.  

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project – the BIL Library was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7 .  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum ( the Alfresco café) , to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

HT|f|FP||CS||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|End Plays are usually considered an expert play. However, hopefully, after I give you a couple of principles on End Plays, you will see they are not that difficult.|CS|1|CP|4|fp|1|at|^- 

{THE BASICS}

{
          If the opponents lead a suit,          

you will often get a trick

that you would not otherwise get if

you had to lead the suit yourself

}
^-|FP||CP||CS||AT|^B@2^Y@3Let us take a simple example:|

qx||ST||MD|haqs5,hk3s6,h52s4,h86s2|rh||AH|Board 1|ah|Howard on End Plays|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Suppose after trick ten you hold the AQ of hearts and one spade. If your left hand opponent holds the King, normally you would lose a heart trick if you lead a heart. However, if he leads a heart, then you will score both your Ace and Queen.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |

- nome: So the West should be forced to lead in this situation.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Yes. Let me change the East/West holdings.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Here, if East is made to lead a heart Declarer will lose one heart regardless. However, in other holdings it is not critical which opponents get to lead. I will address those later.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|You may ask, why would your opponent be so friendly? Well, if you execute an End Play, he may not have any choice. Another reason of course, is, he may have decided that a heart is a good lead. Regardless, the point is, when the opponents lead a suit, sometimes it is to your advantage.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||
qx||ST||MD|haqs5,hk3s6,h52s4,h86s2|rh||AH|Board 1|ah|Howard on End Plays|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|In this particular first example, your left hand opponent must be on lead for it to be to your advantage. As I said earlier, often, either opponent on lead will give you a trick. For example:|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |

qx||st||MD|1hkt3,hq76,haj4,h9852|rh||AH|Board 2|AH|Howard on End Play|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|In this holding, if you play the heart yourself you have to guess who has the Queen and finesse accordingly--a 50% probability of success. On the other hand, if either opponents lead the suit, there is no guess and you make three heart tricks. Let me give you a complete hand. The bidding is not important for the lesson.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|South is declaring a 4H contract. Let us plan out the hand and count the losers. We have 2 clubs, 1 diamond and probably one spade losers. So we cannot afford losing any spades. However, if we have to play the spade suit ourselves, we have to figure out who to play for the Q and finesse that opponent. That is only 50%. But, if we can get the opponents to lead spades, then it doesn't matter who has the Q and thus, we will not lose a spade.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|So far so good. We have decided that, if we can throw an opponent in, and get them to lead spades, we are all set. But how to get there you may ask?|

PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|I ruffed the last club to limit the options of what suits the opponents could lead. If I had not done so, then when West got in, he could safely lead a club and put South back in lead and defeat the End Play. That is called "stripping the hand" and that is an important part of End Plays. Similar to squeezes, you have to get rid of safe exits for the opponents. Here, I am back to that trick.|UP|20|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|There are basically two parts to an End Play:|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


AT|

The first part is to strip the opponents of safe exits.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


AT|

The second part is to throw them into lead so they have to make an advantageous lead that gives you a trick you could not make if you had to lead the suit yourself. In this hand, you might play the spade suit correctly, but you might not. |
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|However, by End Playing the opponents, if you strip the hand correctly, you don't have to figure out the spades. Further, it doesn't matter who had the King of diamonds in order for the End Play to work?|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|This brings us to how to recognize  the presence of an End Play.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|The easiest way is if you have to take a finesse, but can get the opponent to lead such that the hand with the honors is fourth hand  hence, my first AQ example. If the hand with the AQ plays 4th, it will always win 2 tricks. The other is holding AJx and K10X where, no matter if North or South is fourth hand. In both a finesse is possible but with only a 50-50 success rate. An End Play has 100% success rate.|

HT|f|FP||CS||cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|End Plays are more often done in suit contracts because once you strip the hand, the opponents either have to lead the suit you want them to lead (spades in last case), or give you a ruff and sluff.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|In NT, there is no such play as a ruff and sluff, so End Plays are rarer. However, I will have one example of a NT End Play later. There are  many such cases. Again, in general, if the opponents lead a suit, it is often to your advantage to be fourth hand. Hopefully, when I give some other examples, you will see the general pattern. |
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Let's try another hand. On the last hand, you could End Play either opponent. However, on many hands, you can only End Play one opponent. The next hand is an example.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|South is declaring a 4S contract. There are a heart loser and one diamond loser for sure. If West has the Ace of diamonds you have 2 diamond losers  and if spades are not 2-2, you have one spade loser. So, if you are unlucky, which you are on this hand, you will go down, unless you can End Play West into giving you an extra diamond trick. Do not peek by clicking my name to open West hand :).|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Because Kx is in South, please note that if West leads diamonds, you only have one diamond loser. This is a very common position. If the king of diamonds is in the fourth hand to play, it is a guaranteed stopper. If it is not the fourth hand, it is only a stopper 50% of the time. That is why it is often important which hand is declarer. Lets see how this hand might work out.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|One other important point. I note that West led the K of hearts which must be from a KQ combination.  So if I want to throw him in, I can lead the J of hearts. The first thing to do is draw trumps, and hope they are 2-2. If they are the contract is safe.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|The bad news is that trumps are 3-1. If I was just a mundane declarer, I would hope that East has the Ace of diamonds. But, if I am a better declarer, I can see End Play possibilities  because the good news is if I throw West in, he cannot lead a trump. So, if I strip the hand of clubs (hoping that East has 3 clubs), I can throw West in, and he either has to lead a diamond, or give me a ruff and sluff. Let's strip the hand and throw West in. Again, note I have to play clubs first, so West does not have a safe exit.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Again, West is stuck. If he leads a diamond, I score my king. If he leads a heart or club, I ruff in dummy and throw one diamond loser. Even if East overuffs, I still throw a diamond making 4, despite the bad luck on the hand. In this case, I could only End Play West. That is sometimes the case where only one opponent can be End Played. If East was on lead, he can safely lead a diamond.|

^B@2^Y@3^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|So, you have to find hands, particularly trump contracts, where you can get rid of all your non-finessable side suits, and throw the opponent in. What I mean by "throwing the opponent in" is forcing the opponent to win the trick. On this hand the End Play works. |

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|West is stripped of clubs. However, there is one trick to the hand which I will demonstrate in the replay. Here, if I cash all my clubs, and then throw West in, that is 10 tricks gone (5 heart tricks, 5 club tricks). That means I can only keep 3 cards, which means I have to either bare my Ace of diamonds or Ace of spades. So, if West figures out which one is the singleton, then he is no longer End Played. The bottom line is I have to hope West has at most 2 clubs, so I can End Play him in diamonds or spades.|

{         A SUMMARY - MY TAKE FROM THE LESSON by Kia       }
^-|CS||CP||FP||AT|^B@2^z@3^*BS^*Nurely I enjoyed and learned from the lesson and making this presentation. However, it would be unrealistic to expect that I learned all the variations and nuances of End Plays and could recognize them on the bridge table. Nevertheless, I made a cheat sheet which I will share it with you.|
PG| ***** 220 ***** |


AT|

End Play, can happen when an Opponent is put in the lead and forced to lead back only to my advantage. It can lead into my tenaces or give me a ruff and sluff. In no-trump I can only expect a forced lead into my tenaces. However, in suit contract a lead into tenaces and a ruff and sluff are possible.|
PG| ***** 221 ***** |


AT|

End Plays shall be another tool to plan successfully declaring a not so easy auction. It goes above the fifty-fifty finesse tool. Therefore, now I look at feasibility of End Play first if making a contract is contingent on a finesse. |
PG| ***** 222 ***** |


AT|

How would I smell the End Play in a hand. I only can memorizes a few helpful combinations such as AQx-xxx, A10x-KJx and Qxx-Jxx. I have learned that properly executed End Play could assure me two tricks, three tricks and one trick from those three combinations respectively.|
PG| ***** 223 ***** |


AT| 

Finally, a certain amount of preparation is required for End Play which I almost always have to plan at trick one. The one I am going to memorize is "eliminate those suits that I have winners or I can ruff. However, this elimination has to be done carefully not to strip my tenaces.|
PG| ***** 224 ***** |


AT|

Finally, would I be able to do a successful End Play all the times. |cp|8|at|Be serious|cp||at|. Learning End Plays is one thing and executing it properly is something else. Even experts cannot successfully execute End Plays all the times. On the other hand, do not forget that many opponents are very nice and accommodating. That is all folks. On to the practice section.

The pattern of distribution is now complete in the Declarer's mind, as follows:|
PG| ***** 245 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West has already thrown off a diamond, has followed suit on two diamond leads, and has failed to follow suit on the third round. Therefore he held originally three diamonds--and it was previously shown that he originally held five clubs and two spades.|
PG| ***** 246 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That means that his original hand contained three hearts, of which he has discarded one. Therefore he still holds two hearts. Furthermore, South known that West's remaining cards consist of two clubs--exactly the Ten and nine--and two hearts, (denomination unknown). The possible End Play is no longer a shot in the dark.|

up|52|NT|^B@2
This End Play, which took place at the eleventh and twelfth tricks, was absolutely sure to work, because South's count on West's hand was perfect. Even if West did not hold the King of hearts, the contract was sure to be made, as West would have to lead the heart suit anyway. It is equally apparent that a heart finesse would have lost the contract, as South needed 2 heart tricks to complete his required total of 12. |
PG| ***** 255 ***** |


NT|^B@2
At the beginning of the hand he could see 4 sure spade tricks, 1 sure heart trick, 3 sure diamond tricks and 3 sure club tricks, 11 tricks in all. The heart Queen offered the only chance of making the twelfth trick. Finessing would have meant losing the card altogether, as East and West also held the Jack, Ten, and nine.|
PG| ***** 256 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Before leaving this example deal, it should be added that West might have made things very trying for South. If, instead of discarding a club, West had thrown off the Jack of hearts, a different result might have come about. West's last three cards would then have been the Ten and nine of clubs, and the singleton King of hearts. This would put the Declarer in a terrific dilemma. |
PG| ***** 257 ***** |


NT|^B@2
He would know that West held only one heart, but he would have no way of telling it was the King. The discard of the Jack might indicate that West had blanked the King of hearts, but this would not be conclusive. South would have to reach a decision from what he knew of the psychology of the West player.|
PG| ***** 258 ***** |


FP|1|cp|8|at|*|cp||FP||NT||AT|^B@2^*I
Sam Fry, J.: It should be clear that with West holding two clubs and one heart at the eleventh trick, the End Play is out. If South leads a club, West makes 2 club tricks. The dilemma South faces is whether to finesse his Queen or lay down the Ace of hearts for, the drop.

The bidding is unusual, but perfectly logical. Neither North nor South have a suit really worth mentioning, but they have a plethora of high cards. North feels that if South is strong enough to open with one no-trump when vulnerable, he is strong enough to withstand a Slam invitation, and results bear him out.|

Nothing could be more simple than this play. Once South knows that East has nothing but clubs, he knows that his contract is made. The play is a sure thing no matter how the clubs are divided. Even if West held either the Jack or the Ten, and played this card, it would make no difference. |

The manner of playing this hand--hoping right along that West holds the club King--is common with expert players. It is colloquially termed "playing for the best chance," which means to play the hand in a way that will make the contract if the adverse cards are placed right. |
PG| ***** 315 ***** |


NT|
^B@2In this deal, if East should hold the club King, the contract cannot be made anyway. South loses nothing and has everything to gain. Therefore, by playing as though the club King were placed in the West hand, his optimism was rewarded; such optimism--playing for the best chance--is really good Bridge, for it is playing to win some of the time as against always losing.|

Now there is only one heart remaining--the Queen. South has available a two-way spade finesse, but he does not know in which direction to take it, as both Opponents have assiduously refrained from discarding any spades lest they give a clue.

Of course, it may be contended that South could have guessed the finesse right--but what of that? The End Play by throwing West in with a heart is much surer--in fact, it is a dead certainty. Incidentally, note West's discards. If he had only known, he might have kept an extra club, and Declarer would not then have dared to throw him in with a heart. However, in this particular deal, he would have been forced to discard a spade instead of the club, which would probably have enabled the Declarer to mark East with the Queen. |

At the eleventh trick, West must lead back a heart, for he holds nothing else. It makes no difference whether he leads the King or a small card. Even if he held a club or a diamond, he could still not make any tricks. If he held a club or a diamond, and led it, Declarer could retaliate in one of two ways: he could discard a heart from the Dummy and ruff in his own hand, or he could ruff in the Dummy and discard his own losing heart. |
PG| ***** 383 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In other words, the lead of a suit in which both his hands are blank, permits the Declarer to use both of two remaining trumps separately and make 2 tricks instead of 1. It is apparent that the possible play of taking two finesses in hearts will fail, as West originally held both the King and the Queen.|

In taking this double finesse, South is not particularly interested in which card wins the trick. West is now in the lead and has a choice of three suits for his return--anything but a trump (hearts). Certainly a club is out of the question, for it will plunge right into Declarer's Ace-Queen tenace. A spade or a diamond amounts to the same thing--that is, they are the same in effect--so let us suppose that West returns his spade Queen.|

Trick 10. West leads @SQ, North ruffs with @HK, East plays @S10, and South discards @CQ. The Declarer ruffs in the Dummy and discards his losing club from his own hand. He now holds two trumps and the Ace of clubs--clearly the rest of the tricks are his.|
PG| ***** 405 ***** |


mc|12|
pg| ***** 406 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Notice one thing--the Declarer must discard the club from his own hand. To discard a club from the Dummy will avail him nothing, as, even with the discard, the Dummy would still hold two clubs, one of which must lose.|
PG| ***** 407 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You have probably observed by this time that the elimination or stripping which takes place in preparing for an End Play at a suit contract occurs in both Declarer's and Dummy's hands--so that the suits which, at no-trump, it would be undesirable for the Opponent to lead, can be controlled by Declarer's or Dummy's remaining trumps.|
PG| ***** 408 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In this way, if the player forced to lead to the Declarer chooses to avoid the suit in which the Declarer holds a tenace over him, he must lead a suit of which the Declarer and Dummy are void, thereby enabling the Declarer to ruff in one hand and to throw off from the other hand that subordinate part of the tenace which a lead in that suit would have enabled him to win. |
PG| ***** 409 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In other words, an End Play at a suit contract is slightly more complex only in that it permits the Declarer to benefit even when the tenace suit is not led. The player thrown in the lead has to lead into a tenace or lead a suit which will give the Declarer a ruff and a discard.|

Declarer could, of course, ruff the heart King, but if he does so the success of his contract will still depend on the club finesse. He therefore throws off the club which he must lose later anyway, in order to make sure that West will have to lead up to him. |
PG| ***** 446 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Note that this play renders West as helpless as a baby. To lead a heart permits South to discard his losing eight of clubs, while the club lead eliminates another club loser since it enables South's tenace to win. Of course, the play would not work if the Declarer did not first remove the low hearts from the Dummy. This is absolutely essential.|

"Furthermore. Watson's principal book and enduring bridge monument, "Watson on the Play of the Hand," is literally the only bridge book that has remained in continuous demand from the date of its publication (early 1934) into the present day. The book itself presents a curious question. The first printing was 4,000 copies and there was a second printing of 4,000 copies and those 8,000 copies were all that were sold."|

{Book Is Reissued}|CP||AT|

"The scarcity has now been repaired. "Watson on the Play of the Hand" is being reissued this week, intact plus some modernization of the bidding and two chapters on modern developments, written by the editor, Sam Fry Jr. The choice of Mr. Fry as editor was most appropriate, for he was Louis Watson's usual partner, and the two of them, plus Edward Hymes Jr., were considered an inseparable trio. "Mr. Watson's writing technique was simply to take a bridge hand or situation and chat about it. The following deal, literally selected at random, is typical of Mr. Watson's sound advice and method of delivering it."|

Mr. Watson has been explaining the general advisability of establishing one's longest suit at a no-trump contract. In the deal above he turns to one of the standard exceptions and shows the necessity for consciously counting the number of tricks one lends. He describes the play as follows:|
PG| ***** 522 ***** |


NT|^B@2
"West opens the Queen of spades, and South allows this card to hold the trick. |PC|s6s3s5|
PG| ***** 523 ***** |


AT| This sort of hold-up can do no harm and may strip the East hand of spades.|
PG| ***** 524 ***** |


AT| When a spade is continued South wins the second trick with the king.|
PG| ***** 525 ***** |


PC|sjs7s4sk|
PG| ***** 526 ***** |


at| His first impulse is to take his club finesse, but a simple count of the tricks which are available to him will show him that such a precipitate course is wrong."|
PG| ***** 527 ***** |


NT|^B@2
"If the club finesse works he can run off nine tricks without even bothering about the diamond suit, but if the club finesse loses he will have only eight tricks, and spades will be established against him before the Ace of diamonds is put out of the fight. If East holds the diamond Ace all will still be well, but if it should lie in the West hand and if West held five spades originally the diamond Ace will defeat the declare. The point is that declarer must make sure of one diamond trick at once."|

"At the third trick therefore South leads a low diamond, |PC|d3d6|
PG| ***** 529 ***** |


AT| and the trick will probably be won with dummy's ten. |PC|dtd2|
PG| ***** 530 ***** |


SK||AT| Having the ninth trick tacked safely away, South can return to the Ace of hearts and take the club finesse. This will lose, but the declarer need not worry now, since he can make his contract with a total of two spade tricks, two heart tricks, one diamond trick and four club tricks."|
PG| ***** 531 ***** |


NT|^B@2
"Note that the play cannot possibly lose. Leading the diamond first simply provides against a 5-3 distribution of spades. If the spades are adversely divided 4-4 the declarer cannot lose more than four tricks anyway.|
PG| ***** 532 ***** |


AT| Note also that immediately taking the club finesse allows East and West to set the contract, as East can knock out South's last spade stopper upon obtaining the lead with the club king, and West will simply retain two good spades and his Ace of diamonds for the last three tricks."|

"North's jump to three diamonds was very much of an overbid, but the game was not a serious one in which the players watch their conventional p's and q's. Two diamonds would have been the proper response, and the bidding would then have stopped at four spades, or five at most--either contract easily makable. The slam was not technically makable, though with clever play and good luck Mr. Fry managed to make it."|

"This reduced every player to three cards. South had saved the Ace , nine and three of hearts. Dummy had K-J in clubs and the lone Queen of hearts. It seemed to East that South must have a club left, so that if she unguarded her Queen of clubs it would drop under the king. Accordingly, East saved two clubs and blanked the king of hearts hoping West could stop hearts."|

But, West could not stop hearts, and South won the last three tricks, making his slam."|MC|12|

CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play “double dummy,” you see all four hands--it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands.  You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.
After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.’ Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course.  You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made.  You may (not always) use the back arrow in BBO or the undo button in the Viewer to undo the lead.  You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other.  You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. Now, please click |cp|1|AT|^*GR1, RETURN^*N |CP||AT|to return to your original location.|
