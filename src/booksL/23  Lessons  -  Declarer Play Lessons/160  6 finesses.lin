^-{ An Introduction to Finesses }
^-|CP||fp||CP|8|at|^b@2^Z@3W|CP||FP||at|elcome to my continuing series on declarer play. This is the sixth lesson and is on finesses. I will talk about basic finessing technique first. Although the concept is pretty easy, I have noticed that some students get some of the details about how to finesse wrong in certain situations.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


CP||fp||CP|8|at|^b@2^Z@3

F|CP||FP||at|irst, let me talk about a very important principle regarding finesses. Generally, it is much better to lead towards an honor card and play it as 3rd hand, rather than to play an honor card as first hand. To explain further let us take two different distributions of the same suit.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


NT||
ST||HA|y|MD|Ha45,HQ398,Hkj2,HT67|rh||ah|Finesses Lesson|AH|Board a|NT|^B@2
In this example, so long as you lead towards the hand with the KJx, and play the J if second hand plays low, you have a 50% chance of winning 3 tricks in that suit. You should never lead the Jack the first hand.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hj|pc|h6|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


aT|
Next, I will rearrange the cards slightly and explain why. |
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


ST||HA|y|MD|Hj42,,Hak5,|rh||ah|Finesses Lesson|AH|Board b|NT|^B@2
In this example I take the same cards, except distribute them as Jxx opposite AKx. Here, the odds of your winning 3 tricks are very low assuming proper defense.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


at|
If you lead the Jack from Jxx, even if 2nd hand has the Queen, as long as they play it, then you can only make 2 tricks.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


ST||HA|y|MD|Hj42,HQ398,Hak5,HT67|rh||ah|Finesses Lesson|AH|Board c|at|
Because if the Jack is covered, you have to play the Ace or the King.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


PC|Hj|PC|Hq|at|
Say you play the Ace.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


PC|Ha|PC|H6|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


at|  Then you play the King.|PC|Hk|PC|H7|PC|H4|PC|H3|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


AT|  The opponents 10 is now good. |
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


AT|
The only legitimate way for you to win 3 tricks is to play for doubleton Queen as in the next example.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


ST||HA|y|MD|Hj42,HQ8,Hak5,HT9673|rh||ah|Finesses Lesson|AH|Board d|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So, the reason that playing an honor from first hand is not as good is that if the opponents cover the honor, you have to play two honors on that trick for only one of theirs.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


ST||HA|y|MD|Hjt2,HQ398,Hak5,H467|rh||ah|Finesses Lesson|AH|Board e|NT|^B@2
Now as in this example, if I change the suits slightly to J10x opposite AKx, then leading the J works ok. You are back to 50% that you will take 3 tricks in the suit. However, note that in this scenario you need four honors in the suit, not three. |
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


CP|8|AT|^-

^*BSo, in general it is better to play a low card from your hand to take a finesse than a high card.

PG| ***** 18 ***** |


CP||
ST||HA|y|MD|Hq32,Hkt98,Ha45,Hj67|rh||ah|Finesses Lesson|AH|Board f|NT|^B@2
Also, some finesses work when you lose a trick. As in the example here where you have Axx opposite Qxx. If you lead the Queen, you will only take one trick against proper defense, regardless of how the cards are distributed. For the same reason as my previous example if West has the King and plays it, you have to play your Ace, and the opponent's Jack and 10 are now good.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


PC|Hq|PC|Hk|PC|Ha|PC|H6|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, with Axx opposite Qxx you can still take 2 tricks 50% of the time. Let me show you.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||
ST||HA|y|MD|Ha45,Hkt98,Hq32,Hj67|rh||ah|Finesses Lesson|AH|Board f1|NT|^B@2
Now, you just play the Ace, and then lead low towards the Queen. If the King is in West, as in this example, then you will win the Queen if West does not play the King or on the third round if West plays the King.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


PC|Ha|PC|H8|PC|H2|PC|H6|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


PC|H4|PC|Hk|PC|H3|PC|H7|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, reverse the defender hands and you will only take one trick no matter how you play the suit as in the next example.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


ST||HA|y|MD|Ha45,Hj67,Hq32,Hkt98|rh||ah|Finesses Lesson|AH|Board g|NT|^B@2
Also, in this situation if you lead the Queen first, as long as East covers with the King, you can only take one trick, so leading the Queen is never the correct play.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


AT|
So, those were finesses where you have to lose a trick to set up an honor to make two tricks.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||

ST||HA|y|MD|Hak2,,Hj845,|rh||ah|Finesses Lesson|AH|Board h|NT|^B@2
A very common example of that is AKx opposite Jxxx such as in the following example.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


at|
The odds of your winning 3 tricks in that suit are very high because you first cash the AK. Then you lead low towards the Jack.  Now, you have lots of distributions where you will win 3 tricks. Let us look at a few.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


ST||HA|y|MD|Hak2,Hqt9,Hj845,H367|rh||ah|Finesses Lesson|AH|Board i|NT|^B@2
First, there is the case where the Queen is in front of the Jack. That is 50% all by itself as in this example. |
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


PC|Ha|PC|H9|PC|H4|PC|H3|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |

PG| ***** 32 ***** |


PC|H2|PC|Hq|PC|H8|PC|H7|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |

The Jack now is a winner.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


ST||HA|y|MD|Hak2,Hq9,Hj845,Ht367|rh||ah|Finesses Lesson|AH|Board j|NT|^B@2
Then there is the case where the Queen is doubleton, as this example which occurs a fair amount, probably around 15% of the time.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


PC|Ha|PC|H9|PC|H4|PC|H3|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


PC|Hk|PC|Hq|PC|H5|PC|H6|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


at|
Again, the Jack is the third winner.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


ST||HA|y|MD|Hak2,H3t9,Hj845,Hq67|rh||ah|Finesses Lesson|AH|Board k|NT|^B@2
And then there is a 3-3 break regardless of Queen's position. In this example the fourth heart is the third winner. So if you add all those possibilities up, the odds are very high you will win 3 tricks.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


AT|

Okay, let's look at our first hand to illustrate the finessing technique I just talked about. |

First, let me mention that, it is very important as declarer that you gain clues from the auction. However, to simplify things, in these lessons, unless I note otherwise, I have made the auction irrelevant. Just remember what the final contract is. This hand is from the ^*IBergen Declarer Play^*N book, p. 42.|

NT|^B@2
Let's count our tricks as we should do on all hands. Again, if you learn nothing else from my declarer play lessons, I hope you learn to count your tricks at trick one. If you simply do that, your declarer play will improve immensely. Here, we have one spade, two hearts, three diamonds, and one club for sure. That is seven tricks. We need two more.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT|^B@2
One possibility would be to set up clubs. That has two problems. First, we need to lose two clubs, and that combined with losing at least three spades makes us down one. Second, we have no entries to the set up clubs. So clubs cannot provide our extra two tricks. Our only other possibility is the heart suit. If the finesse works, that provides us with one more trick. |
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT|^B@2
And then we have to hope for either a 3-3 break or a doubleton Queen. And, it is very important that we play the heart suit right to make four hearts. First, I have to take this trick with the Ace.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |

Now, to show the problem, I will play the hand the wrong way first by leading the Jack from dummy. Remember, I said it is preferable to lead towards an honor rather than leading an honor.|

NT|^B@2
Here is a good example of why leading an honor is wrong. The eight of hearts is out and you only take 3 heart tricks. Now, let's see what happens if I lead low first, as I should. Let me go back to the second trick.|

{   All About Odds   }
^-|ht|g|CP||fp||CP|8|at|^b@2^Z@3S|CP||FP||at|peaking of odds, let me talk a little bit about the probabilities in bridge. You don't have to memorize a whole bunch of odds to be a good declarer. But if you remember a few general principles, it will help you figure out the best way to play some hands. |
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


CP||fp||CP|8|at|^b@2^Z@3

F|CP||FP||at|irst of all, the odds of winning one finesse are 50%. That should be fairly obvious. If the right opponent has the missing honor, the finesse will work. If the wrong opponent has it, it won't work. And it is equally likely that either opponent has it. Of course, I am assuming there is no clue from the bidding or play.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


CP||fp||CP|8|at|^b@2^Z@3

O|CP||FP||at|ften you have clues from both the bidding and the play, but let us put those aside for now. So the odds of winning one finesse are 50%. The odds of winning 2 finesses are 25%. This is because the first finesse works half the time and even if that finesse works, the second finesse works half the time. So it turns out that makes the odds of winning two finesses 25%. Therefore, any contract which depends on two finesses working is not a very good contract.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


CP||fp||CP|8|at|^b@2^Z@3

O|CP||FP||at|n the other hand, the odds of one of two finesses working is 75% because the first finesse works 50% of the time, and even if that finesse loses, the second finesse works 50% of the time. So, that means at least one of the finesses works 75% of the time. |
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


CP||fp||CP|8|at|^b@2^Z@3

S|CP||FP||at|o any contract which depends on one of two finesses is a very good contract. You don't have to remember the exact odds. All you have to remember is that a contract that depends on one finesse is so-so. Therefore, you should not bid any contracts that depend on more than one finesse (e.g., a finesse and a break). |
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


CP||fp||CP|8|at|^b@2^Z@3

I|CP||FP||at| see many students who feel that, when they have three sure losers and an 8-card fit in a major and are missing the King or Queen, they should be in game. However, that is not the case, because usually beside the finesse working you need a  3-2 break for the contract to make. So a contract that depends on both a finesse and a break is not a good contract.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |

^-{ An Introduction to Finesses }

{   All About Odds   }
^-|ht|g|CP||fp||CP|8|at|^b@2^Z@3H|CP||FP||at|owever, a contract that depends on either a finesse or a break is a good contract. Similarly, a contract that depends on one of two finesses is a good contract, and a contract that needs two finesses is ^*Unot^*N a good contract. |
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


CP||fp||CP|8|at|^b@2^Z@3

A|CP||FP||at|lthough this lesson is about finesses, we also need to talk about odds of suits splitting. The reason for that is often you have a choice between playing for a split or playing for a finesse, and you have to understand when it is better to play for one or the other.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


CP||fp||CP|8|at|^b@2^Z@3

T|CP||FP||at|he thing to remember is that when there are an odd number of cards out in the defenders hand, the odds favor that the split will be as even as possible. The most common case to worry about is with an 8-card fit. In that case, the odds favor the best possible split, 3-2. In fact, although you need not memorize it, the odds are a little better than two-thirds that the split is 3-2.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


CP||fp||CP|8|at|^b@2^Z@3

W|CP||FP||at|hen you are lucky enough to be in a 10-card fit, the odds of a 2-1 split are 75%. So if you are in a 10-card fit missing the Queen, you should play for the drop (75% as opposed to 50% finesse for the Queen). Similarly, with 7-cards out, the odds favor a 4-3 split. Why is that important?|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


CP||fp||CP|8|at|^b@2^Z@3

W|CP||FP||at|ell, a fairly common position is a 5-card suit opposite a singleton. Say you are in a suit contract with AKQxx opposite a singleton. If you play AKQ, then ruff the 4th round, the odds favor that the fifth card in the suit will be good.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


CP||fp||CP|8|at|^b@2^Z@3

O|CP||FP||at|kay, so much for when there are an odd number of cards out against you. When there are an even number of cards out against you, the odds do not favor an even split. The most common cases are a 9-card fit and a 7-card fit. With a 9-card fit, the odds of a 2-2 break are less than 40%. So a contract which depends on a 2-2 break is not a good contract. A 3-1 break is much more likely, around 50%. Similarly, with a 7-card fit, the odds of a 3-3 break are not that good--under 40%. It is much more likely that the cards are split 4-2. Again, you don't need to memorize the odds. What you need to understand is the following:|

If the number of cards out against you is an odd number (such as when you have an 8-card fit), play for the split. |

Okay, now let's see what is going on. We have three sure heart losers and a potential diamond loser. But, we cannot lose any more than the three heart tricks.|

at|

We have two choices as to how to get rid of the diamond loser. One choice is to take the finesse (that is 50%). The other choice is to hope to set up the fourth club and throw the diamond on the club which requires a 3-3 split. So let us move on.|

Therefore, the correct play is the finesse.|

To make the contract again, we  have a choice between a finesse and playing for a break. But, in this case we have eight clubs, not seven clubs. That means the defenders have five between them--an odd number. The odds favor that they will be split 3-2 (in fact they will be split 3-2 more than two-thirds of the time). So, rather than taking the 50% finesse in this case, we should play for the much more likely break.|

A|CP||FP||at|nother common situation is whether to play for the drop of the Queen or take the finesse with a 9-card fit. Most of you have heard the saying "8 ever, 9 never", meaning you never take the finesse with a 9-card fit.|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


fp||CP|8|at|^b@2^Z@3

A|CP||FP||at|s with many things that are supposedly conventional wisdom, that is not really true. Let me explain why I say that. Let us say you have Axxx opposite KJxxx. You play the Ace and the Queen does not drop. Then, you lead low towards the KJ and second hand plays low. It turns out it is about 1% better odds to play the King, rather than finesse--hardly statistically significant. |
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


fp||CP|8|at|^b@2^Z@3

T|CP||FP||at|he reason is that the fourth hand has one more card than second hand, so it is slightly more likely to hold the Queen. So, although the saying is true, it really is not from a practical sense. |

qx||HT|e|fp||CP|8|at|^b@2^Z@3H|CP||FP||at|ere is the rule I use. If I have no additional information, I play for the drop. However, most of the time, one of my opponents has shown a 5-card or longer suit. Maybe they opened a Weak-Two, or one of a major, or they overcalled. If one of my opponents has shown a 5+ card suit, then I play the other opponent for the Queen and take the finesse, if possible. |
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


fp||CP|8|at|^b@2^Z@3

T|CP||FP||at|his is my reasoning. I already know five or more cards of one opponent's hand, and know that the Queen is not in those 5+ cards. Therefore, the odds favor the other opponent holding the Queen. In other words, one opponent only has 8 possible cards that could be the missing Queen. The other opponent has more than eight cards that could be the missing Queen. Therefore, odds favor the opponent who does not have the long suit to have the Queen. If you didn't understand what I just said, let me say it this way.|

I|CP||FP||at|f you have a 9-card suit, and one of the opponents has shown a long suit, play the other opponent for the missing Queen. Having said that, the next hand will illustrate what is called a "discovery play." Sometimes you can figure out if the suit is 3-1 or 2-2. Let's look at an example.|

Now, some of you might be thinking, "Well, Howard said if someone shows a long suit, he plays the other person for the Queen." So, since West opened a Weak-Two, he should play East for the Queen. However, I also know that East has five hearts (four hearts were played), and since they have an 11-card fit, that rule does not apply here. What I would like to do is see if I can count out one of the defender's hands. |
PG| ***** 128 ***** |

If I can find out how clubs and spades are distributed, that will also tell me how diamonds are distributed. So, I will make a "discovery play" to try and discover how the black suits are distributed. I will do that by playing clubs. Keep track of all the cards played by West.|

So, now I know that East started with five hearts, five clubs, and two spades. That leaves East with a lonely diamond. To get information needed I only had to watch one opponent's cards. The singleton diamond could be the Queen. But if it is not the Queen then West has the Queen. So I play the suit as follows.|

As usual, let's see what is going on here. I have two hearts, five spades (in dummy), and one diamond trick. Therefore, I need two more tricks to make the contract. Also, let's look at losers, too. I have one loser in each suit if the diamond finesse loses, for four losers. But, if I lose a diamond, I can pitch my losing heart from my hand on the J of diamonds and guarantee 4, whether or not the diamond finesse works.|

Let's see what is going on. I have a club loser for sure. I also have a potential heart loser and a potential diamond loser. So, on the surface this looks like a pretty bad contract, on 2 finesses working--as I said before, only 25% odds.|
PG| ***** 172 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, if you look carefully, you can increase your odds dramatically. Because, if the diamond finesse works, I can pitch a heart in dummy on the 3rd diamond and I need not take the heart finesse. Further, in order for me to make the hand, the diamond finesse must win. Even if the heart finesse works, I still have to take the diamond finesse. So, there is no point in taking the heart finesse, as I don't need it.

Let's count our winners: two spades, four hearts, three diamonds, and one club. That is only ten tricks. The only hope is to take four spade tricks, and it takes a specific distribution, and you have to watch the spots very carefully. The odds of taking four spade tricks are about 5%. And in real life, you would never try for this, but it is a fun hand to watch the spots.|
