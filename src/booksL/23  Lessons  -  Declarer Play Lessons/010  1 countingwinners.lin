CP||fp||ht|f|at|^c@2^Y@3Maureen Hall (hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :
^D* For beginner bridge players to escape to
^D* Where we could have teachers come and give lessons without interference from Advanced players
^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice
^D* For the beginner to go to and have one on one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions

In 2001/2/3  there was nowhere for that to happen and so in September 2003 Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began.

Nowadays there are lessons and tournaments  for BIL members to take part in every day of the year. All members can apply to have a mentor if they wish to do so and every endeavour is made to find one for them.  

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project – the BIL Library was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7 .  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum ( the Alfresco café) , to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

AT|^c@2^Y@3This presentation is based on Howard Schutzman's lesson on "Counting Winners in Suit Contracts" in Beginner Intermediate Lounge (BIL) which is brought to you in a totally different format. Let me explain.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|

To begin with, I reversed the order of his presentation. First, you will see each example in a closed format with the opening lead. Try to count your winners and plan your play. Next, you will see the same hand in an open format to play it double dummy and  make the contract. Consider this as a warm up practice before the main event. |
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|

Next, you will see the correct play with Howard's Instructions as he presented them during the live session. Finally, after Howard's instructions the same board is presented again with the double dummy feature on for you to practice the hand over and over if you wish. So, just sit back and hit the forward arrow and enjoy the entire presentation. |

^c@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|^*BThis month's topic is probably the most important of all the ones I will teach, as it applies to every hand. It is on counting winners.  I will focus on suit contracts, but NT contracts are very similar for the most part. It is the way I plan every hand I play as declarer. I always count my winners.  I know you are taught to count your losers in suits, and often that is important. But your goal is to win tricks, not lose them, so counting winners is more important. I will present 8 hands, 6 from Marty Bergen's books, and 2 that I played and are in my bridge puzzles. Hopefully, when we are done, you will have a good idea of how to count winners.^*N|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|This first hand is from the ^*IDeclarer Play^*N book, page 129. The contract is 2D. Often the bidding is very important as to how you play the hand. But, for these hands, I want to focus on the play, and not complicate things by worrying about the bidding. So, although the bidding is often important, it will not be for this lesson, just to make things easier.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|As usual, we have to do some planning. The first thing I often do for planning is count winners. Here  I have 5 diamond winners. I will be able to maneuver a heart ruff for a sixth winner. But once I lose the lead by giving up a heart, the defenders will lead another trump, so that I will only get one ruff. With only six winners, where can I get the other two?|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|I see you all have the right idea. I could trump spades and set up a long spade. But, the problem is I don't have enough entries to dummy to cash the spades once I set them up. Therefore, although you had the right idea about spades, hearts is a better idea, because I can set up the long heart in my hand, as I have plenty of entries. So, the plan on this hand is to take my 5 trumps, 1 club, 1 ruff, and a long heart for 8 tricks. Let us get started.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|And now I need to count hearts. Let me discuss the way I count out suits. I don't worry about how many have been played. I worry about how many the defenders have left. Here I started with six hearts, 5 in my hand, and 1 in dummy. That means the defenders started with 7. So far we played one round of hearts, so the defenders have 5 left.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Remember, keep track of what the opponents have left, not what they played. I know when a lot of people draw trumps, for example, they try and remember how many have been played. But that way they have to keep track of a lot more cards. If they just keep track of how many the defense has left, it is much easier to keep track of fewer cards.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|This board is also from Bergen's ^*IDeclarer Play^*N, p. 118. As you note the contract is 4S. Okay, again it is time to plan and count your winners. You have 5 trump tricks, 2 heart tricks and 1 club trick. That makes 8. How do we get 2 more tricks?|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|This is easier than the last hand. There are a number of possibilities, but there is one real easy one. You need to ruff 2 diamonds in dummy. Ruffing 2 clubs in your hand does not gain you any winners. You have 5 trumps, whether you use them to draw trumps or to ruff something. |
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|The way to count winners in trumps is as follows. You look at the hand with long trumps, and count the number of winners in that hand. In this case, I have all top trumps, so I have 5 trump winners in the long declarer hand. That is true whether I use South's trumps to draw trumps or ruff something. Either way I am scoring 5 trumps.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|However, I can generate extra trump tricks by trumping in the short hand. Keep this note in your memory bank for now.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|If I simply draw trumps, the trumps in the North hand will not generate extra tricks, because they will be played when I draw trump. If I want to generate extra trump tricks, I have to get some ruffs in dummy. In this hand, I can maneuver 2 ruffs in dummy, then I can get 7 trump tricks--the 5 in my hand, plus the 2 ruffs. So, to count trump winners, you count the long trumps, plus the number of ruffs in the short hand.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT|^B@2
overhat: What if they are the same length as a  4-4?|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|4-4 essentially works the same way. Pick one hand as the "long" hand. Let us assume for the simplicity that you have all high trumps in your 4-4 fit. You have 4 "long" trump tricks plus, say you can maneuver 2 ruffs in the other hand. Now, you have a total of 6 trump tricks, the 4 in the long hand, plus the 2 ruffs. I hope that explained how you count trump winners.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, if you have to lose a trump trick, obviously you don't always score all your trumps. For example, in a 4-4 fit, say all I have is the A and K, but not the Q and nothing finessable. Then I will take 3 trump tricks in the long hand (assuming a 3-2 break), plus the 2 ruffs from my example, for a total of 5 trump tricks. The principle is the same.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, my 10 tricks are my AK of hearts, my Ace of clubs, plus 7 trump tricks. Let us follow the plan after taking the first trick in my hand. I have to start the diamonds ASAP before the defenders start leading trumps. Further,  I want to save the K of hearts as an entry. Had they led trump on opening lead, I would have needed a different plan.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|This is from ^*IDeclarer Play^*N, p. 122. You get to an overly optimistic 6H, because I was your partner :). Planning at trick one is crucial here. Before touching any cards, let's count winners. Here are 7 hearts, 1 spade, 1 diamond, 1 club and 1 club ruff, which is 11 and we need a 12th trick. One possibility is the Q of diamonds, because you can just knock out the K. However, you cannot get back to dummy to cash the diamond even if you set it up. So, that plan won't work, due to lack of entries. |
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Your only real chance for a 12th trick is to hope West underled the K of spades, for your 12th trick. So I got lucky on this hand, as that is the only lead that lets you make six because now we have 7 hearts, 1 diamond, 1 club ruff and 2 spades.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Sometimes against slams it is good to underlead Kings, in the hope that pard has the Q and you are setting up a trick. It really would depend on the auction here. In real life, I suppose North would have bid spades, in which case a spade lead makes little sense. So, granted, Marty Bergen contrived this hand a bit unless the auction went something like 4N-5D (1 Ace) 6H.|

For those of you who watched my lesson yesterday, you may recall I made 3N, because 3 honor cards were onside. That was my only play, so I took it. The point is, you need to come up with a plan. Initially you may not come up with the best plan but any plan is better than no plan. As you get more practice, your plans will get better.|

There are 2 clubs and 2 diamonds for a grand total of 5 winners for sure. And, if we can get 3 heart ruffs, that makes 8. So, again, by counting winners, I can come up with a plan.

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand there is one technique issue I would like to discuss. We do have 2 entries to dummy to get 2 more heart ruffs. The K of clubs and the K of diamonds. However, we want to make sure we cash our Aces first, because it is quite possible on the 3rd heart, someone will be out, and pitch a minor suit. Therefore, when cross-ruffing, try and cash your winners as early as possible. In this case I am particularly worried about clubs  since we have 8.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|This is from ^*IMore Declarer Play^*N, p. 146. Let's count. We have one club and 1 diamond. If we just draw trumps, we probably have 7 heart tricks, unless they are split 4-0, which we are not going to worry about. In general, until you get real good at planning, just assume normal trump breaks, 3-2, 3-1, etc. |

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|If we can maneuver 2 ruffs in the North hand, we will lose a trump trick, and only take 6 trumps instead of 7, but that still gives you 10 tricks. So, the final count is 1 club 1 diamond, 6 trumps in the South hand, and 2 diamond ruffs in dummy. With that plan let us get the tricks.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|This is the last hand from Bergen's ^*IMore Declarer Play^*N, p. 149. Let's count winners here. This is a trick hand. I would not expect most people to make it. You may have heard of a "dummy reversal". That is a declarer play technique where you ruff in the long hand to get extra trump tricks. This hand is a dummy reversal on steroids, lol.|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Typically, a dummy reversal might work as follows. Suppose you have 5 hearts in declarer's hand and 4 in dummy. And suppose dummy is 4-3-3-3, so you can't get any ruffs in dummy. Well, if you can get at least 2 ruffs in declarer's hand, then you can get an extra trump trick. Because the 2 ruffs in declarer's hand shortens the trumps from 5 to 3, and so now dummy, with 4 trumps, is the "long hand." In that case, you end up taking 4 trumps in dummy's hand plus 2 ruffs in declarer for 6 tricks. That is a typical dummy reversal.|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, you normally have 5 heart tricks. You can't get a spade ruff in dummy due to the trump lead. But, if you can ruff 4 times in the South hand, then dummy becomes the "long" hand. Ruffing 4 times in your hand reduces your trump length to 1. So, dummy with 2 trumps becomes the "long hand." As I said, a dummy reversal on steroids.|
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Now then, you can count 10 winners if you can get six trump tricks: 6 trump tricks plus 4 side tricks (the Ace of spades, AK of clubs, and Ace of diamonds). All you have to worry about is your entries. So let us see how our plan would work out.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, as I said last time, when ruffing a long suit, you have to make sure the opponents cannot discard and trump your side winners. Since you have long clubs, you need to use your club entries first, because it is more likely someone is short in clubs.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out on this hand, the J of spades comes down, so your last spade is a 12th trick as well, but that is not high percentage. The problem with real hands sometimes alternate lines which are lower percentage work. But in this case no matter what, I have 12 tricks. In spades, in order to set up the 10 you need the person with the J of spades to have no more than 3, with 7 out against you.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Basically, I came up with a 68% line, 3-2 trump break which was very easy to execute. It took all the complication out of the hand. Although we saw some very interesting hands from Marty Bergen, in real life, usually the simpler plan is best.|

Double-clicking any seat will open all hands. No peeking please. After finishing your plan, click the forward arrow to play this hand double dummy.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Another real life slam. Because I bid aggressive slams, they are often hard to play :). You can download this from January 2008, puzzle 2. This hand is an example of a real dummy reversal, not the steroid one from before. In this hand, I am going to ruff several times in the South hand, so the North hand becomes the hand with the "long" trumps. First, let's count winners: 3 clubs, 1 diamond. That is only 4 tricks and I need 8 trump tricks.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|I could try and set up diamonds, and that is an alternate line and perhaps that is even better. In which case I take 1 diamond, 1 long diamond, 2 diamond ruffs, 3 clubs and 5 hearts for 12 tricks. That is actually probably a better line. So let's try that one first.|
