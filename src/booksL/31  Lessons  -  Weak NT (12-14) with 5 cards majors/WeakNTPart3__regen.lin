cp||at|This article is the third of three introducing the weak 1NT opening bid (12-14 HCP). In the first article, I discussed uncontested auctions when there was a weak 1NT opening bid. In the second article, I discussed how to bid if you play the weak 1NT opener and you hold a strong NT. In this article, I will discuss methods for bidding when the opponents interfere over a weak 1NT opening bid.|

Since partner cannot open 1N with 2 doubletons, you are guaranteed to play in a 4-3 fit at worst. For example, with diamonds and spades, you would bid 2 diamonds. If partner has a doubleton diamond, he bids 2@h.You then correct to 2 spades. |

at|^^|cp||at|^bIf you prefer the "new" DONT, you can modify this system appropriately. In the new DONT, 2@h and 2@s are single suited hands.

This means that all bids by responder retain the same meaning as if there had been no overcall, and a double means "the opponent made the bid I wanted to make (he 'stole' my bid)". This is a very simple and effective approach.|

If, for example, I have game forcing values with diamonds and the overcalled suit is hearts, if I first bid 2N followed by 3@d, then I am saying I want to play in 3@d.

at|^^|cp||at|^aA cue bid by responder is Stayman, indicating at least one 4 card major and game forcing values (the cue bid is at the 3 level). However, there are 2 different Stayman sequences. A direct cue bid indicates that responder does not have a stopper in the overcalled suit. A bid of 2N followed by a cue bid indicates that responder does have a stopper (SASS). Note that if the overcalled suit is clubs, the 2 different Stayman sequence approach does not work. That is because opener bids 3C over 2N, so obviously responder is no longer able to cue bid 3@c. So with clubs overcalled, 3C is still Stayman, but whether or not responder has a stopper is undefined.|

If you rebid 2N or 3N over partner's response to your double then you have a stopper. If you don't have a stopper, you must be prepared for whatever bid partner makes over your double. Also, with no 4-card major, partner should bid 2@d without a club stopper and 2N with a club stopper.|

at|^^|cp||at|^aIf responder's suit is below the overcalled suit (for example, the overcalled suit is hearts and responder's suit is clubs or diamonds), responder must make a unilateral decision. He can either bid 3 of the suit and force to game, or bid 2N to play a 3 level partial. However, if responder's suit is higher than the overcalled suit (for example, the responder's suit is spades), then he can use the Lebensohl 2N sequence. Over opener's forced 3@c, responder bids 3@s. This shows an invitational hand with spades. Note that with less than invitational values, responder would bid 2@s. |
at|^^|cp||at|^a|
at|^^|cp||at|^aWith game going values, responder would bid 3S directly. So the 2N sequence followed by 3@s specifically shows an invitational hand. Note that I suggested an alternative treatment above where this sequence showed a game forcing hand and a stopper in the overcalled suit. If you play that treatment, there is no way to show an invitational hand even when your suit is higher than the overcalled suit.|

at|^^|cp||at|^a^*bResponder has no 5 card suit but would like to compete for a partial^*n|
at|^^|cp||at|^aIn traditional Lebensohl, double is for penalties. However, I recommend that you play a double by responder as "competitive", showing a balanced hand willing to compete (approximately 8-10 HCP). In general, opener should bid his lowest 4+ card suit in response to the double. On occasion, opener may pass with good defense and length (usually 4+) in the overcalled suit. Some may argue that this approach gives up the ability for responder to punish the opponents for a bad overcall. |
at|^^|cp||at|^a|
at|^^|cp||at|^aHowever, in my experience, responder holds a balanced competitive hand much more frequently than a penalty double, so this approach works out better in the long run. There are a couple of variations you can play. One is what I discussed above, where a double of 2@c is Stayman (and a direct 3@c cue bid is Stayman with no stopper but game forcing values). Another is what I call the "2 way double" which I find very effective in match points. If we are not vulnerable the double is competitive. If we are vulnerable the double is penalty. Using this approach I often get the opponents for -200 (down 1 doubled vulnerable) which is usually a top board in match points.|

cp||at|In this section, I will briefly discuss some guidelines for competing when the opponents open a weak 1N. It is certainly possible to play one of the standard conventions, either DONT or Cappelletti. Cappelletti has the advantage of allowing you to make a penalty double. DONT has the advantage of allowing you to more effectively compete at the 2 level; some of the Cappelletti bids (2H, 2S, and 2C when your suit is clubs) force you to the 3 level. Of the two, I have a strong preference for DONT, as it allows you to easily describe more hand types. Giving up the penalty double is not costly as you rarely will get to defend 1N doubled. |

at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bI am not a big fan of Cappelletti. But my feeling is that the best approach is to play simple natural overcalls. I overcall with the same values for a 2-level overcall as I would had the opponents opened 1 of a suit. I use a double to show an equivalent balanced hand. It is neither strictly takeout nor penalty. Partner can pass with 8 or more points, particularly with a balanced hand, but does need to worry about whether we would do better bidding game or setting them doubled. |

at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bWith an unbalanced or weak hand, partner should bid their suit. With a strong hand, when partner feels we should be in game rather than penalizing the opponents, he jumps to the 3-level. As a slight modification to the above, you can play "transfer overcalls". These are similar to natural overcalls except your overcalls are a transfer. For example, if you bid 2@d over 1NT, you are saying you have hearts. Partner can either simply accept the transfer (by bidding 2H) or make whatever bid he would have made over a 2@h overcall (such as raising to 3@h or 4@h or bidding a new suit as a forcing bid). I like this approach slightly better than simple overcalls because it gives you a little more flexibility. With a stronger hand, you can make another bid when partner accepts the transfer, including either showing a 2nd suit or raising partner to the 3-level to show a game invitational hand. |

at|^^|cp||at|^bOne other approach is called "Mohan". It is a bit complicated. It combines penalty doubles, major suit transfers, and methods to show 1-suited and 2-suited hands. I personally prefer playing the simpler natural (or transfer) overcall method, but Mohan is a reasonable, if somewhat difficult to remember, alternative.|
