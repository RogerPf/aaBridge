at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bSome of you may be concerned that if responder has a very weak hand when partner opens 1N, you will get doubled for a big penalty. Although this is theoretically possible, it hardly ever happens. In my 40 years of playing the weak NT, I would guess I have gone for a big penalty less than a dozen times after opening a weak NT. There are several reasons for this. It is difficult for the opponents to double low level contracts, particularly in modern bridge which tends to emphasize bidding over defending. Also, even with a bad hand, if responder has a reasonably long suit (5 or more cards), your side usually will not go down that much if you play in that suit. So the possibility of incurring a large penalty is so small that it does not represent any real detriment to playing the weak NT.|

Although the modern tendency is to relax the strict requirements for the strong 1NT opener, the same reasoning does not apply if you play the weak NT. Relaxing the strict requirements allows you to open more hands 1NT (at the cost of losing some of the precision of opening 1NT).

cp|4|at|In this section, I will present the requirements for opening a weak 1NT. I strongly recommend that you follow these recommendations religiously, and remain disciplined when you open 1NT. Although the modern tendency is to relax the strict requirements for the strong 1NT opener, the same reasoning does not apply if you play the weak NT. Relaxing the strict requirements allows you to open more hands 1NT (at the cost of losing some of the precision of opening 1NT). However, playing the weak NT, you will have many more opportunities to open 1NT, so you need not sacrifice the precision of the 1NT opener to increase its frequency.|
at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp|4|at|^bSimilarly, it is imperative that if you have a hand that meets the requirements for opening 1NT, you must open that hand 1NT. If you do not, you will be forced to lie on your subsequent bids. Also, since you did not open the weak NT, your partner will make certain assumptions about your hand that are incorrect.

at|^b@2|at|^^|cp||at|^bI would hesitate to open this hand 1NT even though it meets the requirements. It does not meet the rule of 20 (12 HCP + 7 cards in 2 longest suits = 19), so I might not open it particularly in 1st or 2nd seat. However, I do open 1NT with 4-3-3-3 hands and 13 or 14 HCP. I dislike 4-3-3-3 hands, and mentally subtract a point when I encounter them.|

at|^^|cp||at|^bHowever, I do not like that approach, because now your club and diamond distribution is very ambiguous (you could have 4 diamonds, 5 diamonds, 4 clubs, or 5 clubs). Playing weak NT, if the auction proceeds 1@d-1@h/@s-2@c, you are guaranteeing 5 diamonds and 4+ clubs. Granted, if you open this hand 1@c, you may have to rebid an anemic 5 card club suit, but your partner understands this is part of the system. |

cp||at|Before getting into some specific recommendations on how to respond to the weak NT opener, let me just say that you can basically use your current response structure to the strong NT if you so desire. The main difference between the weak and strong NT is that the weak NT requires 3 less HCP (the 12-14 range is 3 HCP less than the 15-17 range). Therefore, if you simply add 3 points to the requirements for all your responses, you can use the same structure. If you consider 8-9 HCP as an invitational hand for the strong NT, you can consider 11-12 HCP as an invitational hand for the weak NT. Similarly, if you consider 10HCP as a game forcing hand for the strong NT, you should consider a 13 HCP game forcing for the weak NT.|

at|^^|cp||at|^bHaving said that, let me suggest one small adjustment. It turns out that if you have 12 HCP opposite 12 HCP, you are a favorite to make 3NT even though you are 1 point short of the 25 HCP recommended for bidding game. For those of you who play rule of 20 openers, this should make sense. You often open 12 HCP hands, and if your partner opens and you as responder have 12 HCP that meets the rule 20, you would force to game. So, if your partner opens 1NT and you have 12 HCP, I recommend you force to game.|

I recommend you only use major suit garbage Stayman with 5-9 points or 5-5 in the majors; simply transfer to your 5 card major with 0-4 points, as that is likely to play better. |
at|^^|cp|4|at|^b |
at|^^|cp|4|at|^bIf you hold an invitational hand (10-11 HCP), you should bid 3 of the major with a six card suit and 2N with a 5 card suit. If you hold a game forcing hand, you should bid 4 of the major with a six card suit (assuming you choose not to play transfers at the 4 level), or 3N with a five card suit. This is the same structure as you play over strong NT, with the point counts adjusted appropriately. |
at|^^|cp|4|at|^b |
at|^^|cp|4|at|^bThere is some question as to whether partner should 'super accept'. If you are conservative by nature, you should play partner must always accept the transfer at the 2 level, in case you have a really bad hand. However, I prefer playing that partner should 'super accept' to the 3 level with 4 card support; that has the advantage of getting you to some thin games, and also preempting the opponents even if you have a bad hand. |

And bidding Stayman makes it less likely the opponents will compete.|

This shows an invitational hand with 4 spades. Playing 4 suit transfers, starting with 2@c does not guarantee a 4-card major. So by bidding 2@s over 2@h, you are saying you do have an invitational hand with 4 spades. If partner is 4-4 in the majors he will be able to place the contract in spades|
