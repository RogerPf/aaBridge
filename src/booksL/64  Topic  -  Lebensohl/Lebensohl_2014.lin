ht|g|cp|8|AT|^*BHoward Schutzman:^*N|cp||at|^*BLebensohl^*N is a convention that some people play to deal with interference over their 1NT openings. It is a flexible but quite complicated convention that is easy to get wrong. Therefore, for those playing strong NT, I usually recommend they play "^*BSystems on, Stolen Bid Doubles^*N." That means responder's bids retain the same meaning as if there was no interference. For example,|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


HT|k|CS|4|at|{|ia|1n2d2h|at|}  @2

PG| ***** 11 ***** |

If the suit is higher than the suit bid by the opponents (for example, responder has spades and hearts were overcalled), responder can simply bid that suit at the 2 level. As I indicated before, 2 level bids by responder are natural and to play. Next is an example:|

This is by far the most common usage of the artificial 2N bid by responder, to allow your side to compete in a partial.

Note that this treatment only applies if responder's suit is lower than the overcalled suit. 

In my example (where the opponent overcalled 2@H), if responder bid 3@S over opener's forced 3@C bid, that has a whole different meaning which I will explain later. If responder wanted to play in a spade partial, he would simply bid 2@S.|

Any bid at the 3 level is a game force and shows 5+ cards in the bid suit. Thus, the following auctions are all game forcing auctions:|

Let's take the case where responder would have bid 3N had there been no interference. That is, responder has 10+ points and no 4+ card major. The only issue here is whether or not responder has a stopper in the overcaller's suit. A direct bid of 3N after the overcall denies a stopper in the suit. For example:
|HT|q|CS|4|at|{|ia|1N2H3N|at|}|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


at|

Here responder denies a heart stoppers. Hopefully, the 1N opener has a stopper and all is well. If not, then opener must bid his cheapest 4+ card suit and you must scramble to find the best contract.|

This topic illustrates one of the important principles of Lebensohl. It is called "Slow Action Shows Stopper". 

What that means is that if responder goes slowly, by first bidding 2N and then 3N, that shows a stopper. Bypassing 2N denies a stopper. Note that this principle only applies for raises to NT and Stayman auctions (which I will discuss next).|

PG| ***** 35 ***** |

What would we do with the case where responder has a 4 card major and a game forcing hand?|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


AT|

There are two things to remember:

^C1) A cue bid of the opponent's suit is Stayman.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


AT|

^C2) The "Slow Action Shows Stopper" principle applies.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


AT|

Therefore, a direct cue bid of the opponent's suit is Stayman, but denies a stopper. By bidding 2N first, and then cue bidding, responder is also bidding Stayman and showing a stopper as well. Thus, in the following auction, responder is bidding Stayman without a heart stopper: |VA|4|at|^L{|ia|1N2h3h|at|}|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |

The following auction is also Stayman, and shows a heart stopper:|

HT|u|Va|4|AT|^m@2^Z@3If responder shows a stopper, opener has an easy time. He can bid a 4 card major if he has one (assuming it is not the opponent's suit) or bid 3N without a 4 card major. Opener also has an easy time if he has a stopper even if responder does not. Again, he can bid his 4 card major or 3N. If opener has neither a 4 card major nor a stopper, he must bid his cheapest 4+ card minor and you must scramble to find your best spot.

^-|va|3|CP||CS|4|fp|1|CP|8|at|O|CP||FP||AT|ne of the more complicated cases is when responder has a 5 card suit and invitational but not game forcing values. In general, responder must decide whether or not he wants to force to game. If he wants to force to game, he can bid his suit at the 3 level. If he just wants to play a partial, he can bid his suit at the 2 level or use the artificial 2N bid, as we discussed previously.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


AT|

However, there is one case where responder can show a 5+ card suit and invitational values:

-- when responder's suit is higher than the overcalled suit. 

Responder can then use the artificial 2N bid to show that hand. Let me give an example.|

^B{|ia|1N2H2NP3CP3S|at|}|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


HT|p|at|^m@2^Y@3In this auction, a direct 2@S bid would be to play. A 3@S bid would be a game force. Therefore, this sequence shows an invitational hand with a 5+ card spade suit. This is a fairly rare case, and you and your partner can agree not to worry about it if you want to make things a bit simpler.|

^-|va|3|CP||CS|4|fp|1|CP|8|at|N|CP||FP||AT|ow let's talk about doubles. Traditional Lebensohl defines doubles as penalty oriented. If you play strong NT, that is a reasonable way to play them. The other alternative is to play doubles as "competitive". By that, I mean a double shows a hand where you want to compete for a partial, but do not have a 5 card suit. That would be some balanced 5-8 count.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


AT|

Playing the weak NT, I think competitive doubles make sense. Of course, responder's point count is 8-10, because the 1N hand is weaker. For those of you who know my wife Ava and her love of penalty doubles, we do not play that. But I do play competitive doubles with most of my other weak NT partners. However, playing the strong NT, I find that penalty doubles work out well. Ok, now let's have you try some examples.|

In all cases, your partner opens 1N (15-17) and you hear a 2@H overcall.|

Therefore, you must have the invitational spade hand. Note that when the opponents overcall hearts, the 2N invitational sequence only applies if you have spades.

Lebensohl convention - By Howard Schutzman}
^-|fp||ht|f|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Before I get into the specifics, let me explain the general guidelines behind Lebensohl:
- Bids at the 2 level are natural and to play.
- Bids at the 3 level are natural and forcing to game.
- A bid of 2N is completely artificial and forces opener to bid 3@C. It is used for several purposes. 

The most common is to play a partial at the 3 level when the opponent has bid a suit higher than the suit in which responder wants to compete. Another less common usage is to indicate responder has a stopper in the suit bid by the opponents. 

If responder forces to game after bidding 2N (as described below), he is showing a stopper. If responder forces to game without bidding 2N, he is denying a stopper. Lebensohl adherents call this "Slow Action Shows Stopper" (SASS).

In the next few paragraphs, I will describe how responder handles various hand types.|

^*BResponder wishes to play a partial in a 5+ card suit.^*n 
If the suit is higher than the suit bid by the opponents (for example, responder has spades and hearts were overcalled), responder can simply bid that suit at the 2 level. As indicated above, 2 level bids by responder are natural and to play.

If the suit is lower than the suit bid by the opponents (for example, responder has diamonds and hearts were overcalled), responder bids 2N, a completely artificial bid. Opener must bid 3@C. Responder can pass if he wishes to compete in clubs. Otherwise, responder can bid his suit (diamonds in the example) and opener is required to pass. Note that this treatment only applies if responder's suit is lower than the overcalled suit. 

In the above example, if responder bid 3@S over opener's forced 3@C bid, that has a whole different meaning, as explained below (if responder wanted to play in a spade partial, he would simply bid 2@S).|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


AT|

^*BResponder has a 5 card suit and game forcing values.^*n
Responder simply bids the suit at the 3 level. For example, assume hearts were overcalled. Responder can bid 3@C, 3@D, and 3@S, all of which are natural and show game forcing values.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


AT|

^*BResponder has a 4 card major and game forcing values.^*n
A cue bid by responder is Stayman, indicating at least one 4 card major and game forcing values (the cue bid is at the 3 level). However, there are 2 different Stayman sequences. A direct cue bid indicates that responder does not have a stopper in the overcalled suit. A bid of 2N followed by a cue bid indicates that responder does have a stopper (SASS).

Note that if the overcalled suit is clubs, the 2 different Stayman sequence approach does not work. That is because opener bids 3C over 2N, so obviously responder is no longer able to cue bid 3@C. So with clubs overcalled, 3C is still Stayman, but whether or not responder has a stopper is undefined.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


%%%
NT|
^*BResponder Wishes to Raise to 3N^*n
The only issue to consider is whether or not responder has a stopper in the overcalled suit. With a stopper, responder bids 2N, and bids 3N over opener's forced 3@C bid (SASS). With no stopper, responder jumps directly to 3N; if opener does not have a stopper, he bids his lowest 4 or 5 card suit.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


AT|

^*BResponder has a 5 card suit and invitational values.^*n
If responder's suit is below the overcalled suit (for example, the overcalled suit is hearts and responder's suit is clubs or diamonds), responder must make a unilateral decision. He can either bid 3 of the suit and force to game, or bid 2N to play a 3 level partial.

However, if responder's suit is higher than the overcalled suit (for example, the responder's suit is spades), then he can use the Lebensohl 2N sequence. Over opener's forced 3@C, responder bids 3@S. This shows an invitational hand with spades. Note that with less than invitational values, responder would bid 2@S. With game going values, responder would bid 3S directly. So the 2N sequence followed by 3S specifically shows an invitational hand.|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


AT|

^*BResponder has no 5 card suit but would like to compete for a partial.^*n
In traditional Lebensohl, double is for penalties. However, I recommend that you play a double by responder as "competitive", showing a balanced hand willing to compete (approximately 8-10 HCP for weak NT and 5-7 for strong NT). In general, opener should bid his lowest 4+ card suit in response to the double. On occasion, opener may pass with good defense and length (usually 4+) in the overcalled suit.

Some may argue that this approach gives up the ability for responder to punish the opponents for a bad overcall. However, in my experience, responder holds a balanced competitive hand much more frequently than a penalty double, so this approach works out better in the long run.|

Unknown Source}
^-|fp||ht|d|AT|
^B@2^*BMM: ^*NIn the good old days before learning how to count by hand, I was trying to learn all the ritzy conventions such as Lebensohl, Fourth Suit Forcing, and Kickback Keycard Asking. So I collected any information I could find on those and stored them on my hard drive. One such folder has been full of information on Lebensohl convention—mostly quiz boards.

So many of my folders are choke full of information on ritzy conventions remained neglected until now. Howard wanted to have a tutorial on how to play after partner's 1N is doubled or overcalled.

Then I could not resist and opened the "Lebensohl" folder and the gem which you are about to view is imported here—you spared 80+ boards. Unfortunately, I have no recollection where from I squirreled them away and who is the author. I beg his/her forgiveness and I will amend if I get the needed information.

Of course, Howard had his usual review. This is a great learning tool if you wish to play Lebensohl convention. Just a fair warning. There are a whole slew of them. So put on your seat belt and get set for a rough and long ride.|

Bid 3@S. As opener, your first obligation is to tell partner you also have four Spades. Resist the temptation to tell her about your Heart stopper by bidding 3NT. |

bid 4@D. you do not have four Spades and you do not have a Heart stopper, so bid your long suit. Partner may pass, in which case you surely have no makeable game. Alternately, you should consider playing a game in your 4-3 Spade fit. Your hand is near-maximum and you take Heart ruff in the short trump hand. |mb|4D!|sk||mb|p|mb|4s|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|
