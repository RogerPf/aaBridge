I was kibbing a random table when this hand came up.  Declarer (South) had three different partners while this hand was bid.  But whatever the reason, he managed to go 1 down.  

His recently arrived partner then apologized for sacrificing saying he felt the Opps would make their 4@s.

What no one noticed was that declarer had managed to go down in a stone cold  DOUBLED  contract.

Let's see how  YOU  do.

at|^^Your most recent partner may have bid  5@c's  as a sacrifice but you are very likely to have 4 defensive tricks against 4@s (count 'em).    4@s's  is down, giving most N-S's a positive score.    So us going down would be a disaster.  |

at|North is clearly the Master hand (long trumps).  We have  3  losers    0@s    2@h(1f, 1s)     1@d(s)    0@c
We only need to dump 1 loser.  Some options are -
^c@2@.  lead low to the @hK,    ^n OR                         
@.  finesse against the @dQ one way  ^*bor^*n  the other     ^n OR
