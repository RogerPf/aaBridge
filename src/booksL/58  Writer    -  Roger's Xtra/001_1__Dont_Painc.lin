A while back I played the following hand and was genuinely surprised to find, from the Traveller that a 

number of  GOOD  intermediate players, that I know, had also played that hand and had gone down.



The only reason I can think of,  for the cause,  is that they must have,    panicked.

^s That is enough of a hint.    :)|

at|North with the long trumps is clearly the master hand.    Therefore we have    NO losers in @c's,    NO losers in @d's,  NO losers in @h's   and surely (at worst only)  2 losers in  @s  and that on a (4-1) split.
That leaves us with just those  2  losers so we can expect to make an over trick.|

They panicked, with confused thoughts of  5-0  'bad splits'  ^^ ^h     and just thinking of   @sQ J x x x    sitting on top of the their  poor  @s10 9  in dummy.
But 5-0 splits are normal and natural,  they happen 4% of the time,  that is 1 time in 25  (when you have an 8 card fit).|

pg| ***** 18 ***** |


at|^^East started with five @s's and West with none.      What actual @s's  does East have ?|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


at|^^All the other @s's are visible in your hand and on the table.    So East holds  @sQJ873|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


at|^^it is true that, this means that, West will now make a third  @s.     But is that a problem ?   
As we have 6 @s's in the North and West only has 5 @s's so we start a tempo ahead, but even that does not matter.|
