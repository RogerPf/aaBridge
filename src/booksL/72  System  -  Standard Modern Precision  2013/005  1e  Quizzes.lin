Handout with Quizzes:  1@d Response to 1@c - 0-7 HCP, any distribution

Generally when you open a strong club, it’s one of the delights of bridge 
– you announce to the world you probably have the strongest hand at the table – 
kind of like opening 2@c in standard, but you get to do it more often. 
 
But the 1@d is a splash of water in the face 
- responder might have a Yarborough and is advertising such.

Opener must take a chill pill and get back to business.  
Time to find the 8 card major suit fit, and get to the proper level.

The following quizzes you should attempt after reviewing the main text, 

Standard Modern Precision – Getting From Here to There.  

Answers will appear at the end.  

As always, hands are displayed in spades-hearts-diamonds-clubs order.|

Answers to Quizzes

Quiz 1: Opener’s rebids after 1@c-1@d

a. 1NT – This is a 17-19 HCP NT on the ladder, which rebids 1NT.
b. 1@h - This is forcing, so we will show the length of the hearts later by rebidding 2@h if possible.  If you were worried about that stiff @cQ, the length of the hearts should compensate.
c. 1@h - Majors come first always in this sequence.  The plan is to seek a 4-4 heart fit and retreat to clubs if not.  Partner’s next bid will tell us how to proceed.   Partner cannot Pass 1@h.
d. 1NT – Generally 5332 hands are NT hands – so this is a 17-19 NT and rebids 1NT.
e. 2@d -  In contrast to hand (c) this hand has no major suit so is free to bid the minor suit immediately.
f. 2NT –  On the NT ladder, this hand is too strong to open 2NT, so opens 1@c and jumps to 2NT.  Partner can now use Puppet Stayman or transfers or whatever you normally use over a 2NT opening.
g. 2@s - if you are basically at game you should announce such by jumping in the major.  If you like you can use the cheaper minor as a 2nd negative over these jumps, just as if you opened a standard 2@c and rebid a suit.
h. 1@h - Again, majors first.  If partner has 4 hearts or 4 spades we will find a major suit fit.  If partner has neither major we could play 1NT or 2@d.  
i. 3NT – This is the game forcing NT hand.  I recommend you might think about playing Kokish so that 1@c-1@d-2@h is 2-way:  hearts or this hand.  Partner would be forced to relay 2@s and now you can rebid 2NT with this hand (so you have transfers and Stayman available) and anything else with the heart hand.  But for now, you just jump to 3NT.  Why not open 3NT?  Because you want to investigate slam if partner has 8+ HCP and does not bid 1@d.  If you open 3NT with a strong hand you lose that ability.|

Quiz 2: Responder’s rebids after 1@c-1@d-1M

a. 1@s - up the line, 0-7 HCP
b. 1NT – the double-negative, denies spades or good heart fit
c. 2@s - a jump-shift rebid shows a top of the range hand with a good 6 crd suit
d. 2@h - 4 card support double-negative
e. 2NT – a mini-splinter raise of hearts, partner can relay to find out where the singleton is
f. 3@h - 4 card support, top of range
g. 2@c - a good hand, but denies 4 spades or a fit, artificial
h. 2@d - the “support double” – good hand but just 3 hearts
i. 4@d - a void mega-splinter;  your hand has increased in value from the 1@h rebid

Quiz 3:  Responder’s rebids after 1@c-1@d-1NT

a. 2@h - transfer to spades;  just as if partner opened 1NT
b. 2NT – invite to 2NT (or if you use 4 suit transfers, bid 2@c followed by 2NT)
c. 2@c - seeking a 4-4 heart fit;  we will continue to  game since partner’s minimum of 17 and our 7 gives 24
d. 2@s - signoff in a minor (or, playing 4 suit transfers, 2N);  we aim to get out in 3@d

Quiz 4:  Opener’s rebids after 1@c-1@d-1@s-2@c

a. 2@s - 6 or more cards, minimum hand;  we may have enough for game, but if partner has a singleton or void in spades, the hand is not so good – if partner has a doubleton, she will probably try 3@s now
b. 2@d - we want to get out in the best partial, so we wait with 2@d;  if partner has 4 hearts she will bid 2@h and we can Pass;  if partner has a doubleton spade she will rebid 2@s and we will correct to 3@c (which partner should have length in)
c. 2@d - again, we have a flexible hand;  if partner rebids 2@s, this time we will Pass
d. 3@d - we show 5+ diamonds and a game forcing hand
e. 2@h - if partner has 4 hearts partner may raise us, possibly to game;  you may choose to play that this promises 5 hearts (and wait with 2@d with just 4 hearts);  also, you may choose to play that 1@c-1@d-1@s-2@h promises 6, and 1@c-1@d-1@s-2@c may have 5 hearts (rebid 2@h)
f. 3@s - game forcing, 6+ spades;  if partner rebids 3NT we will play it there|

Quiz 5:  Opener’s rebids after 1@c-1@d-1@h-2@d

a. 2@s - we know there is no spade or heart fit, but we want to get to 3NT from the right side;  if partner rebids 3@c we know there is a diamond problem and may proceed to 5@c;  if partner rebids 3@d we will rebid 3NT;  if partner goes back to 3@h we will complete our shape with 4@c and partner can make the final decision
b. 4@h - we know where we want to end up, so we bid it
c. 3@s - a jump-shift after a major fit is a splinter;  we might have slam
d. 3@c - we are going to wager game, we just want to right-side 3NT, or get to 5@c;  4@h might be ok but we are ruffing with the long trump hand which would be embarrassing if trumps were 4-2 or 5-1
e. 2NT – we want to see what partner has;  if partner rebids 3NT we are happy to play it there;  if partner rebids a minor we will investigate slam lightly;  we can always go back to 4@h at any time

Quiz 6:  Responder’s rebids after 1@c-1@d-2@s

a. 3@s - announce the fit and let partner take it from there
b. 2NT – this hand could be played in several different strains – 2NT is the best waiting bid
c. 2@h - we have a long suit, though the hand is not the best
d. 4@s - fast arrival in a game forcing situation;  however if you play 3@c 2nd negative, this would be the time
e. 4@d - splinter for spades, not a minimum|
