mb|p|sk|s|mb|4S|at|djneill:  The first thing to note is that we will not often Pass 2@d!
It's not forcing, but make sure you know, partner has zero or 1 diamond
Here, South has a pretty good idea what North has
The @dAce will cover a singleton nicely, and the 9-card fit in spades should make game promising
Finally, South knows the opponents might have a game in diamonds!
So it's important to strike fast
|

nt||sk|w|mb|5D|at|djneill:  Now West has to guess
If South bid slowly, West would have an easy @d bid
Now it's harder to make the right decision

a maximum with 4 @s's   3 @h's   1 @d    and  5 @c's

The reason ^*bwe bid the 3-card Major^*n is that we want partner to declare the 4-4 major fit, hiding her hand.
If we bid the 4-card major, we will be declaring, and the opponents will know what declarer has exactly
|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt||mb|p|sk|s|mb|3Nppp|at|djneill:  South can take stock here, there is no 4-4 major fit.
But there is a 7-1 diamond fit, and they probably will run
South has 16 HCP, and North 13-15 about     so that's 29-31 HCP, pretty close to slam
It might depend on exactly what North has
Without any good information, it's not good to risk a slam.

The problem with 2@d or MiniRoman is:  What's trumps?
How do you ask keycards for THIS suit, rather than THAT suit?
If you read ahead, after the shape is known, responder can bid:

4@h = RKC for @C  or   4@s = RKC for @h   or   4NT  = RKC for @s
