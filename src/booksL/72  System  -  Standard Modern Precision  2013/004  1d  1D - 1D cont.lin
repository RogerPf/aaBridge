^*uSouth has a special call now which shows a (5-7) with a   3-card raise  (2@d)^*n

Kind of like a support double.          I agree you will have to study this a bit.
It is not like SAYC or 2/1 at all.       
But it is like Drury
So it is a bit like something you may have seen before.
North has just 17 HCP with a stiff King.   Not what (5-7) and a 3-card support will get to game on.
So North can just sign off in 2@s

In SAYC or 2/1, North would open 1@s 
and South would either Pass or respond a forcing 1NT (too weak for a 2@s raise)
and N-S would alight in 2@s just the same probably. This actually comes close to making, maybe it does.
But you don't have to get to every game at matchpoints|

- This time MAFIA again
1@c   1@d
1@s is forcing for one round
        1NT   (double negative)

So immediately North knows it's time to start running to find some fit.
2@c    pass

In this case, North's clubs could be longer than spades.
South is happy to find a "get out" and passes 2@c
So even though there is a 5-3 spade fit, South does not know if North has 4 or 5 spades
But South does know North has 4 or 5 clubs     (or more)    So the safest move is to Pass 2@c
At least there is an 8 card fit.

West has an interesting hand, in fact, one that would overcall over 1@d
However, I will go over interference in another lesson.     It's important :-)|

Now it's time for the "other" drury:

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psakj872htdakjt7c6|at|}    |cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp1dp1sp2cp3dp4dp4np5cp5d|at|}|at|^b@2
|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|ps3hj865dq954ckj54|at|}

North MAFIA's with 1@s
^*uNow South can show 6-7 HCP WITHOUT a fit with 2@c^*n
It's kind of like a "non fit Drury"      but, it's 6-7, that's pretty good!

North can now see a game in the offing    North has just 16 HCP    but just about 3 losers
So 6-7 will do nicely, ^*uNorth can jump to 3@d to force to game with 5+ diamonds^*n
South can try 4@d (we are in a game force).   And North can try RKC!   alas, North settles for 5@d
If South had an Ace and the @dQ, there would be slam, or maybe even without the Queen

In standard, North would open 1@s, South would respond 1NT
North might rebid 3@d, and South is having problems imagining a game.
Precision makes it easier.|

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psjt852h743dq53ct8|at|}



Sometimes North has just a hand that wants to bid game and shut out everyone else.
But this hand by North is way too strong for a 4@s opening.
The solution is to open 1@c, and THEN bid 4@s

North does not really care about South's hand.   It's a gamble
In this case, South's @dQ is well placed and it comes in.|

|cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp1dp3nppp|at|}|at|^b@2

This time North is in a different sort of gamble
North has a "strong" version of the gambling 3NT

This is where the Kokish I talked about earlier helps.
If you use 1@c-1@d-2@h for all GF balanced hands
It leaves free 1@c-1@d-3NT for the gambles.

North has 8 tricks in hand, and random honors in the majors
Anything might let this make.|

- Let's get back to the Drury:
|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|pskqj4haj83d3cakq2|at|}   |cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp1dp1hp2dp2sp2npp|at|}|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|ps6h642dajt6cj8753|at|}

North MAFIA's with 1@h.  The idea is to find a 4-4 fit wherever spades or hearts.  
South now bids the 2@d Drury  -    3-card support,    5-7 HCP.  
North has 20 HCP,  so adds it up  25-27 total.  
There is enough for game, but it's time to be sneaky and get South to declare.   

North does not want to declare with the singleton diamond, so North can bid 2@s to wait and force.  
South has minor stoppers so tries 2NT.. just what North wanted to hear. |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
- Here's another hand for MAFIA:
|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|pst2hAKQ5dK8cAKQJ7|at|}   |cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp1dp1hp2dp3cp3n|at|}|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psAQ9h964dJ97ct953|at|}


2@D   "drury"   (5-7 hcp, 3-card support)  

This time, same start.  North again angles South towards 3NT.  
South has stuff in the @s and @d so tries 3NT.  

You might wonder why South is not raising clubs.  
There is a club fit after all, but South knows that 11 trick contracts can be difficult.  
3NT is a lot easier, just 9 tricks and South has nothing really to ruff â€“ 4333.|

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psQ5hQ6dJ9642c9864|at|}

Here's another hand for MAFIA.  
1@s is forcing one round.  
South has a double-negative.  (1NT  =  0-5) 
So North runs to 2@d and South will take it.

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|ps975hA85dK43ct854|at|}

North has a good hand here.  Let's put MAFIA to the test.  
South has the 2@d Drury.  
North is happy to hear South is 5-7,  but 4@s is not the game, 5@d is!  
The problem with the 4-3 @s fit is that the long trump hand (North) may be ruffing early, shortening the spades.  
Diamonds is safer.  
South is surprised to find herself declarer, but it's pretty easy.

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psJ93hQ64dKJ7ct432|at|}



Here South has another 2@d  Drury.  
North has 19, enough for game, so bids 3@d, not signing off in 2@s.    
South again has a 4333 so tries 3NT.

Here is how to show:  ^*b4 of a Major and 5+ of a minor      Game Force^*n

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|psakhakq9caqj8654|at|}     |cs|1|sd|n|at|{|ia|p1cp1dp1hp1np3cp5c|at|}|at|^b@2

|cs|1|at|^b{|ih|ps652h74dt32ck9732|at|}


First the Major is bid     (MAFIA)
And south shows a double negative with 1NT  (0-5)
Now North ^*ujumps in the minor^*n
This promises just 4 of the Major, and 5+ of the minor.
South sees clubs are the best fit, so bids 5@c   (Or even 4@c )

Very difficult in standard methods.
If North opens 2@c in standard, you might get there, but South will never take the push
Precision makes it easier.|

If North has a ^*uGF hand with one long minor^*n...
North can just bid the minor at the 3-level
This ^*bdenies^*n a 4-card major

We saw earlier that ^*bwith a 4-card major you bid the major first^*n
So South need not worry about spades and just bids 3NT

I'll stop for today, but you get a good idea how 1@c-1@d works, thanks Maureen and Rosemary
I'll send a worksheet to review     

(MM: See next part   ^$40   )
