^-{An Introduction to Managing Entries}
^-|CP||fp||CP|8|at|^b@2^Z@3H|CP||FP||at|i everyone and welcome to my 5th lesson on Declarer play. In this lesson I will discuss managing entries. As I have said previously, the most important part of planning a hand is counting your winners. You should count your winners on every hand that you play, to make sure you give yourself your best chance to make the contract. If I get you to count winners from these lessons, then I have succeeded in my mission to make you all better declarer. |
PG| ***** 2 ***** |

The second most important thing on many hands, in terms of planning, is managing your entries. Once you count and figure out how you can take the right number of tricks, then you must also make sure you can get to the appropriate hand to take those tricks.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|

On many hands, if the points are divided evenly, this is not a problem because both declarer and dummy have enough high cards and trumps to ensure that you can get to whatever hand you need to. But on some hands, particularly when one hand is weak, managing entries is extremely important. There are two main reasons why you might need to have an entry to a particular hand.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|

A. When you want to run a long suit.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


AT|
B. When you need to take one or more finesses.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


AT|

There are other reasons as well, but those are the main ones on most hands. All of the hands in this lesson are from Marty Bergen's 2 ^*IDeclarer Play^*N books. I will mention the page numbers as the lesson proceeds.|

nome: |CP||AT|Unlike the live session I am using a closed format to maximize the teaching value of the board. Please, review each board and establish your plan to make the contract before reading Howard's instruction. You have another chance to practice this hand double dummy after he complete his explanation. As always you can open any hand by clicking the name on the hand. For example, to see the cards in the East hand, click East: hondo717.  To open both defenders’ hands, click both East and West.  Good luck.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|This example is from p. 86 of Bergen's ^*IDeclarer Play^*N book. As with the other lessons, most of the time the bidding is not that important for the purpose of the lesson. I do not mean to imply that you should ignore the bidding. In fact, quite the contrary. As declarer, you often gain important clues from the bidding. But for these lessons, unless I specifically mention the bidding, to keep it simpler, I do not worry about the bidding.|

^B@2nome: |CP||AT|Time to make your plan. Count your winners and make sure you have entries to both hands. Then, please tap the forward arrow to see Howard's explanation and the play of the hand.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, you can assume West did not overcall spades and the final contract is 3N. So,let's count our winners. There are one spade, four hearts once the Q is out, at least one club, and three diamonds. That gives us a total of nine tricks. However, there is one problem we must overcome right away. We have to get to the South hand to run the hearts and we will possibly need two entries, unless the Q of hearts is doubleton or singleton. |
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|We will need one entry to knock out the Q of hearts and we will need a second entry to get back to the South hand to run the hearts after losing the queen. However, we only have one apparent entry to the South hand, the King of diamonds. By the way, this hand illustrates a common situation where there are entry problems and that situation is where one hand has only honors in a suit and no low cards. On this hand, both hearts and diamonds in the north hand have that problem, no low cards.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|When you encounter that situation, you often have what is known as a "blocked" suit. That means, in order to cash the suit, you must use another suit for transportation. If, for example, one of North's clubs was a heart instead then everything would be easy. After cashing the King of hearts we could use the low heart to enter the South hand. But, here the heart suit is blocked. the diamond suit is not blocked exactly, but it would be nice if we could swap the 10 of diamonds for the Jack.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|When you have a potential blocked suit, you should cash the honors in the short hand as early as possible, to remove the blockage. Okay, on this hand we need 2 entries to South, and we only have one. What can we do?|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|We can force another entry to the South hand by overtaking the King of hearts with the Ace of hearts on the same trick. Some of you suggest to duck the spade.  The reason I don't want to duck the spade, by the way, is because I said West did not overcall spades, therefore I suspect West does not have 5 spades and I don't want a club shift. |
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|So, let's proceed with our plan with taking the opening lead and overtake the King of hearts with the Ace.|

AT|
hope: I still would have ducked the first round of spade.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|To further explain, I probably could have ducked the first spade, but I was worried about a club shift and I specified that West did not overcall spades. Therefore West is not likely to have 5 spades, because with KQJxx a spade overcall was likely. |
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|A club shift at trick 2 could cause a problem, although with 7 clubs to the AQ, not likely. So, I suppose I could duck one spade because:
a) West not likely to shift, and 
b) even if he does, it is probably not fatal. So ducking one spade is fine but you do need to be worried about shifts when ducking tricks. Let me move to the second example.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|As usual, let's count our tricks. There are one spade for sure, probably two, two hearts, two diamonds, and four clubs. So, we have 9 tricks. But we have a potential entry problem to the clubs. We have no sure entries if the defense ducks the Ace of clubs twice. But, given West overcalled spades, we do have a potential entry with the Queen of spades if West has the King.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|With what card I take the opening lead is very important. That could be a trap. Let's say I take the opening lead with 10 of spades in South. If West defends correctly I have no spade entries. Let me show you.|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|I grant the point that for many of you, this play would not matter, as the defense might be nice and not duck 2 rounds of clubs. But if playing against good defenders, East will duck, and you will be stuck if you take the 10 of spades. |

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, let's count the sure tricks and notice that the club suit is blocked. As I discussed earlier, the club treatment is very important here. We have two spades, four hearts two diamonds, and three clubs. That is 11 tricks. Normally, if clubs are no worse than 4-2, we could lose a club, and take 4 club tricks. However, we again have an entry problem. No big surprise, as this lesson is about entries :)|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out that although they are not 3-3, they are still divided in a way that is lucky for us. But, our first order of business is the diamonds. Since the King of diamonds is our only entry to clubs, we should not play it at trick one.|

Twice in clubs and once in diamonds, For those finesses you need 3 entries to the board. The Ace of spades is one and 2 trumps are the other two. However, you need the six of trumps to ruff a spade, so you cannot lead it to get to the board. So in what order should we take the finesses?|

It turns out dummy has some nice heart spots and in fact, if we are careful we can force 2 dummy entries.|

However, we might be able to establish a long club for our 12th trick. Again, we have to play three rounds of clubs before they are established. Therefore, we need an entry to dummy after the 3rd round of clubs. The Ace of hearts and the Ace of clubs are two entries. If we are careful, we can establish clubs if they are 3-2.|
