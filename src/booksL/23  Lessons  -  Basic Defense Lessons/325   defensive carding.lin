^-|FP||cp|8|AT|
^b@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This lesson discusses the best way to play your cards when you are a defender. Proper defensive carding is very important, because it often gives partner vital information. When you are declarer, you can play your cards anyway you wish, because partner is dummy and is not participating in the hand. However, when you are defending, if you card correctly, you will help partner defend, because he or she will have a better picture of your hand. If you card incorrectly, then you will mislead partner, and may cause a misdefense. This lesson includes two sub-topics:|

{        Third Hand Defensive Play        }
^-|CS||cp||FP||AT|^b@2^z@3The person who plays the third card to a trick is often in the most disadvantageous position. Why is that? |
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


AT|

Well, first let's look at fourth hand, and see why that is the most advantageous position. If you are fourth hand, you can see all the other cards on the trick and play the card that provides the best advantage to you. If you choose to win the trick, you can win it as cheaply as possible, preserving higher cards in that suit when you have them. And if you cannot or choose not to win the trick, you can play the lowest card you have in that suit, preserving all your other higher cards. |
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


AT|

As an aside, the whole idea behind executing an end play is to set up the hand so that:|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT|

a) You are fourth hand on the next trick.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


AT| 
b) The defense has to lead a suit that gives you an advantage over having to lead the suit yourself.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


AT| 

As an example, assume you are fourth hand and hold AQ in the suit led. You are then guaranteed 2 tricks in that suit. If third hand plays a card lower than the Queen, you will win the Queen and the Ace. If third hand plays the King, you will win the Ace and your Queen is good. On the other hand, if you are forced to lead the suit yourself (you are third hand the first time the suit is led), you will only win 2 tricks if the person to your right has the King and you choose to play the Queen. Next, is an illustration of the above example. We only look at the spades suit and South is the declarer.|

So, what does that mean if you are unfortunate enough to be the third hand to play to a trick, and both partner and the opponent has followed low to the trick? It simply means you should play your high cards to give the most advantage to your side. |

{        Third Hand Defensive Play        }
^-|CS||FP||cp||AT|^b@2^Y@3You may have heard the advice that “third hand should play high.” Although that is certainly true in many cases, it is very oversimplified. In this section, I will explain the principles of third hand play, and when it is and is not right to play high. I will also explain how to play your cards in a way as to give your partner the most amount of information. |
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


AT|

Should you always win the trick as third hand if you can?|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


AT| Not necessarily. In fact, there are many situations where it is not to your best advantage to win the trick when you can. The best use of your high cards is to use them to capture an opponent's honor. For example, it is much better when you play your Ace on the same trick as an opponent's honor than to play your Ace and there are no opposing honors on the trick. Let's look at an example (in all examples, you are East).|

If you cannot use an honor to capture one of the opponent's honors, the next best use of your honor is to force out an opponent's honor. That way you can set up lesser honors for your side. |

This example illustrates the advantage of third hand high. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


AT|

Okay, so much of the time you play third hand high. However, when you have a sequence of high cards, you have a choice as to which card to play. For example in the next situation:|

If partner leads the 5, |PC|s5s2|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


AT| should you play the Queen or the Jack? Your first reaction probably is that it does not matter. And, in fact, that is true as far as it goes. However, there is one play that gives partner more information than the other play. Let us assume you decide to play the Queen and South wins the Ace. |
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


PC|sqsa|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Partner now knows that his King is good. But, partner does not know that you also have the good spade Jack. Now, let us assume you decide to play the Jack. |

UP||UP||
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


PC|sjsa|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


AT| South still wins his Ace. However, partner now knows that you have the Queen. Why is that? Because if South held the Queen, he would have captured your Jack with the Queen, not the Ace. So, by playing the Jack, partner has much more information than by playing the Queen.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In fact, the correct third hand play when you have an honor sequence is to play the lowest card in that sequence. In the above example, the Jack is the lowest card of your Queen-Jack sequence. If you held the Queen, Jack, and 10, your correct play would be the 10. It is imperative that you play the lowest card in your sequence to make sure partner knows what you have.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you incorrectly played the Queen in the example above, partner will now be entitled to place the J in the South hand. And partner is not at fault for assuming that–-you are, because you did not play the correct card.|

Let us look at another example.|

If you mechanically play the Queen, third hand high, then once partner takes the King, declarer will take a second spade trick with the Jack.|

NT|^B@2
However, if you think about it for a minute, you can see that, in terms of forcing out one of declarer's honors, playing the 10 is equivalent to playing the Queen. Since you can see the Jack in dummy, you know that by playing the 10, you will not be giving declarer a cheap trick with the Jack.|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |

In fact, by playing the 10, you are setting up two tricks for your side, whereas by playing the Queen you are only setting up one trick. ^*BLet us go back^*N.|

PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The basic principle these examples illustrate is as follows. If dummy has an honor, and you have a higher honor, try and keep your honor to capture dummy's honor. In the example above, try and keep your King to capture dummy's Queen. That means if you have a higher honor plus the 10 or 9, play the 10 or 9 rather than your honor.|

^-|CS||FP||cp||AT|^C@2^Y@3Before I get into details, let me give you an important cardinal principle of defense:|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


ht|j|cs|4|cp|8|FP|2|at|^-{
  "When declarer leads a suit and you are second hand, play low quickly and smoothly."  
}
^-|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


CS||CP||FP||AT|

Most players, especially inexperienced ones, find this a very hard principle to follow. But, I can promise you, if you can train yourself to play second hand low smoothly, you will gain many more tricks than you will lose. |
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


AT|

I cannot emphasize the importance of following this principle enough. If you learn nothing else from this lesson but second hand low, you will still improve your defense immensely.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


AT|

Why should you play second hand low? You already learned the most important reason from the last section. Remember, the most important use of an honor is to capture an opponent's honor. Well, if declarer leads a low card and you play second hand high, then he will play a low card from the third hand, and your high card will not capture anything useful. On the other hand, if you play low, then declarer will be forced to play a high card from the third hand and hopefully partner can capture that high card with one of her own high cards. |
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


AT|

Let's look at an example. You are West and South leads the two of spade towards North.|

PG| ***** 78 ***** |


at|
You might be thinking, “If I don't play the King and declarer has doubleton Ace, then I may never get my King.”|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


AT| 
That is possible but not likely. And even if it is true, if you play the King, it is likely that declarer can use the Queen to throw off another loser. |
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


AT|
Let me ask you to consider another question. Who has the Jack, declarer or your partner? Do you know for sure? |
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT|^B@2
For now, for the sake of argument, let us assume you know that declarer has the Ace and partner has the Jack. In that case, do you see the advantage of playing low? If you play low smoothly, declarer, who may not realize what a good defender you are, is likely to guess that you don't have the King, because you were so smooth in your play, He likely will play the 10 in the hope that you have the Jack, and he can force out the King to set up his Queen.|

PG| ***** 88 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now, let's get back to the question of do you know who has the Jack. You may be surprised to learn that it is almost certain that partner has the Jack. Why is that? Because if declarer had the Jack, he would finesse partner for the King, in the hopes of winning three spade tricks. Remember, just as you do not know many of the cards that declarer has, declarer does not know many of the cards that you have. If you hesitate as second hand, you are giving declarer information that he is not entitled to.|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


NT|^B@2
One of the more important aspects of defender play is to maintain steady tempo. This is known as always playing “in tempo”. If you play more slowly, maintain the same speed throughout the game. If you play more quickly, again, remain “in tempo.” By doing so, you alleviate any inference declarer might make about what cards you hold. By the way, it is considered unethical to hesitate when you have nothing to think about, in an attempt to mislead the declarer. Let us look at another example.|

{     DEFENSIVE CARDING     }
^-|FP||cp||AT|^B@2^z@3Welcome to week two of my bridge 202 lesson series on defense. This week's lesson is on defensive carding. The general series is divided into two parts. The first four weeks are lectures on specific topics. Last week was opening leads. This week is defensive carding. Next week is defensive signals. Week four is on counting out the hands. This lesson discusses the best way to play your cards when you are defending. Proper carding on defense is a very important skill that many less experienced players do not appreciate as much as they should.|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


AT|

When you are declarer, you can play your cards in any order you wish, since your partner is dummy and you need not communicate with him or her. However, when you are defending, you must use proper carding to communicate with your partner as to what you have in your hand.|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


AT|

If you card incorrectly, then you will mislead partner, and possibly cause a misdefense. I carefully watch every card my partner plays on defense. Some of my partners find this annoying, however, it really helps me defend better, and I strongly prefer that my partner cards correctly. Today we will discuss 2 topics. The first topic is third hand defensive play. The second topic is second hand defensive play.|
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


AT|

Let's talk about third hand defensive play. The person who plays the third card to a trick is often in the most disadvantageous position. Why is that? Well before I answer that, let me explain why playing the fourth hand to a trick is the most advantageous. If I could change the rules of bridge so that I could always play fourth hand to every trick (without, of course, having to lose the previous trick), I would make a lot more contracts. The reason fourth hand is the most advantageous is as follows. |
PG| ***** 114 ***** |

In the fourth hand, if you can and choose to win the trick, you can win it as cheaply as possible and if you cannot or choose not to win the trick, you can throw your lowest card and preserve all your other cards. The whole idea behind an end play revolves around this concept. You set up the hand so that you play fourth to the critical trick and you make the defense lead a suit that gives you an advantage. |

In that case, the diamond or club would be ruffed in dummy and South would pitch the Queen of spades. This is the essence of an end play, and why playing fourth to a trick is so advantageous. |

^B@2^Y@3Now, with a heart lead, North will lose the first five tricks because South plays second to the heart trick, instead of forth, the @HK is no longer a stopper. This illustrates how the King can be a stopper when it is in the hand playing fourth to a trick and the same King is not a stopper when it is not in the hand playing fourth to a trick. This is one of the reasons behind the theory of transfer bids over NT. Transfer bids allow the strong NT bidder to be declarer. That means that the NT bidder will be the fourth hand to the first trick.|

Fourth hand can figure out which card to play to the trick once third hand has played to the trick. But third hand must usually play (and often sacrifice) a high card in order to force fourth hand to play a high card to win the trick. |

You may have heard the advice "|CP|8|AT|THIRD HAND SHOULD PLAY HIGH|CP||AT|" and, in fact, that is often true. However, that is vastly over simplified. In this lesson I will explain when it is and is not right to play high. Should you always win the trick as third hand if you can? Not necessarily. There are many situations where you should not win the trick.|
PG| ***** 146 ***** |

If you remember last week's lesson, I was discussing why you should generally not lead unprotected Aces. I said, the best use of an Ace is to capture one of the opponent's honors. The same is true when playing third hand. If possible, you would like to use your honor to capture an honor. Let me show you an example.|

Now, East has to think what is the best card to play. If East plays the Ace, declarer will win two spade tricks. One with the @SQ and the other with the @SK. This will allow him to throw a diamond loser away on the @SK. |

On the surface it appears that it does not matter which card East plays  and, in fact, if West were a mind reader that would be true. However, I am sure most of you wish that your partners were mind readers, but they disappoint you all the time. So, maybe we can help our poor non-mind reader partners a bit.

Now, West has no idea where the @SJack is. If East has it, they should cash two spade tricks--by leading a low spade when he gets on lead. But if South has it, then West would rather have the @SKing capture South's @SJack. In fact, by cashing the @SKing, West would be setting up South's @SJack if he had it.|

It is now obvious to West that East has the @SQueen because if South had the @SQueen, he would have won the @SQueen instead of the @SAce. Therefore, playing the @SJack provides West with very useful information. Thus, the general rule as third hand is to play the lowest card in a sequence of touching honors.|
PG| ***** 182 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If East had @SQJ10, East should play the @S10. For example in fact, on this hand, if East plays the @SQueen, West should assume that South has the @SJack. And if East gets mad at West, West needs to find a better partner.|

Now lets look at a slightly more complicated situation. First of all, everyone should realize that you should not play the @SQueen. East's @SQ10 "surrounds" the @SJack in North. There would be no reason to play the @SQueen, since the @S10 will force out the same high card from South. And, in fact, playing the @SQueen would unnecessarily set up the @SJack for declarer. So, we know not to play the @SQueen. On the other hand, we also have a touching sequence here the @S109.|

South only gets 2 spade tricks. This is a case where you have a dummy "surrounding" problem. You want your @SK to capture the @SQueen. So, you play the @S9 to preserve the @SKing over the @SQueen. |
PG| ***** 215 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In general, if the dummy has an honor, and you as third hand have a higher honor plus the 10 or 9, you should play the 10 or 9. Even if East's holding were @SK92, East should still play the @S9. It will almost never give up a trick, and sometimes will create a trick. Honor paired with a 10 or 9, surrounding dummy's honor, is a position you should remember and card correctly by playing the 10 or 9. The general principle is, try to keep higher honors to cover dummy's higher honors.|

^B@2Here, a lot of inexperienced players will hesitate on the spade which is why you must train  yourself to play low smoothly. Experienced players will smoothly play the two of spades. You may argue, suppose South has the doubleton spade Ace then you will never get your spade King. First of all that is unlikely and second of all, let me ask you this. Why is West almost certain that East has the @SJack?|
PG| ***** 222 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The answer to that question is, if South had @SAJ, he probably would finesse East for the King, and take three spade tricks if it worked. It would be silly to lead low towards the @SQueen with the @SAJ in South's hand, and risk losing an unnecessary spade. Regardless, if you hesitate as West, South will know that he should play the Queen. However, if you play the @S2 quickly, it is at best a guess for declarer as to whether South should play the @S10 or @SQueen from the dummy.|
PG| ***** 223 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In fact, many South would assume that you would hesitate with the @SKing, and if you don't would always play the @S10, hoping you had the @SJack. So, remember, play second hand low smoothly. |

I think most people would play low here, but let's discuss why that is the right play. Remember, you want your Ace to capture an opposing honor and if you play high, then North will play low, and declarer will win two spade tricks. And, here again, declarer is not sure whether from dummy to play the King or 10 if you play low smoothly.|

NT|^B@2
Finally, in this particular example, if you play low, South can only win one spade trick no matter what. If he plays the King, that will be his only spade trick, assuming you save your Ace to capture the spade queen. And if he plays the 10, East will win the J, and you will win the spade Ace.|
PG| ***** 232 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Let me repeat, by playing low, you are forcing third hand to play high, putting third hand at the maximum disadvantage. You win 2 spade tricks by playing low. Playing high, you only win one. So, remember, it is almost always right to play second hand low smoothly.|

West should play what is knows as "split your honors." If your partner has the @SKing, it does not matter which spade you play. But, if South has the @SKing, you must play an honor to force out the @SAce. Otherwise, South can win a cheap trick with the @S10. Now, the convention is, when splitting honors, you play your highest honor, in this case the @SQueen.|

By playing your highest honor, East now knows you have the Queen and Jack but not the King. If you played the King that would show a sequence headed by the King. West plays the @SQueen on this hand, when West has an honor sequence. Otherwise, West should play low. Therefore, by playing the Queen, East knows that partner has the J. otherwise there is no reason for West to play the Queen.|

There is one other common situation. Let me illustrate in the next example.|

This example is a very common situation. The declarer has King-Jack and leads low towards it.|

Hopefully everyone can see why playing low smoothly is mandatory. Even with the AQ you should probably play low. In this situation, playing low smoothly will at least force declarer to guess whether to play the King or the Jack. |
PG| ***** 263 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, if you play low smoothly even with the Ace and Queen, perhaps declarer will play the King, and only take one spade trick instead of the two to which he is entitled. So, when declarer leads low toward the King and Jack, play low smoothly usually even with the Ace and Queen. There is very little advantage to playing the Ace.|

^-|CP||fp|2|ht|f|at|^c@2^z@3Maureen Hall |FP||AT|( hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

^D* Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players

^D* Where beginner players could get to meet one another and play together to practice

^D* For the beginner to go to and have one-on-one lessons with a mentor free from interruptions.

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors; the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily – activities include Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite.

In 2005  having a  Library for  storing all the lessons notes and help notes for using BBO became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project-–the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. Today members have access to it 24/7.  The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

Maureen encourages all members to contribute to the Library, to participate in the BIL Forum (the Alfresco Café), and to send in articles and suggestions for publication in the monthly Gazette.

{    HOW TO PLAY DOUBLE DUMMY    }
^-|CS||AT|
To play a board double dummy, play free, means you can manually play out the cards seeing all 4 hands. This is a great way to practice. To do so, click on the card you wish to play from that hand on lead. Click on the cards from the next 3 hands in order of the play to complete the trick. Click on the trick to "close" it. Continue this procedure until all 13 tricks are played.

You can place your cursor over any closed trick to review the cards played to that trick. You can undo a play by clicking on the back arrow button in the BBO toolbar or the undo button in the viewer. To cancel double dummy play and move to the next section, click forward arrow button.|CS|6|AT|^-

{    HOW TO OPEN A CLOSED FORMAT DEAL    }
^-|CS||AT| 
As you may know, you can see the cards in all hand diagrams, examples, and deals.

You can reverse your action by another left click. |CS|6|AT|^-
