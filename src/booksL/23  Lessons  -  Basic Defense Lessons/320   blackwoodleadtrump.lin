The movie set up is very simple. The boards with the bidding are presented first. Then comes Mr. Blackwood's comments. I think it is much easier to understand and follow the teaching when it is presented in an almost live setting. But I may be totally biased.|

^B@2^*BEasley Blackwood: ^*N|cp||at|When declarer has bid two suits, you have strength in one of his suits, and dummy has supported the other, there is a good chance that he plans to win a lot of tricks by cross-ruffing. Next are some hands that illustrate the point. Suppose you are West, defending against a four-heart contract with the following hand:|

But if the bidding is as shown above we have a different situation.|MB|1sp1np2hp3hp4hppp|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Try to visualize the North and South hands. North has shown six to nine HCPs, no more than two spades, and at least four hearts. Only after hearts are bid does he show any interest in a game. South sounds like he has at least nine, and possibly ten, cards in the major suits. That means that he is short in the minor suits, and is likely to be trumping them early in the game. |
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In other words, there is a good chance that declarer will be trumping spades in the dummy and one of the minor suits in his own hand. You know he is not likely to grab many first-round spade tricks with your holding in that suit. So it looks like he is going to depend on a cross-ruff to bring him in ten tricks. What is the best way to stop a cross-ruff? |

In the open room it was a different story. Leventritt passed the hand which Schenone had opened. The result was that Santamarina, South, opened one club, and the Argentina team duly reached four hearts, but this time played by South. This sequence of bidding clearly called for a trump lead. |

NT|^B@2
Leventritt's right-hand opponent had bid two suits, was playing in the second suit, and Leventritt had control of the first suit. South's bidding indicated shortness in spades, while North's bidding indicated length in both major suits and shortage in at least one of the minors. All of the symptoms were there that the declarer needed to cross—ruff the hand. Leventritt's opening heart lead frustrated this plan.|pc|h9|

You will see that in the closed room, the bidding by the Argentines kept them from getting the information they needed to lead trumps. In the open room, the Americans followed the principle of talking less and listening more. Sometimes you wonder whether the information given by a defending pair who take part in the bidding is more helpful to the declarer's side than to their own.|

In the open room, Avarelli opened two clubs, an artificial bid showing a three-suited hand, either 4-4-4-1 or 5-4-4-0, with 11 to 16 HCPs. Belladonna, South, held two five-card suits and knew that Avarelli had at least four-card support for one of them. His two notrump bid was artificial and asked Avarelli to tell him where his short suit was. Avarelli's three-club bid said that he had a singleton or void in clubs. |
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Given this information, Belladonna went straight to five diamonds. Maybe he would have done better to find a crooked road. Charlie Goren, on opening lead with the West hand, had been listening to the auction. Having seventeen HCPs, he knew that the opponents' bidding must be based on distribution. Avarelli had said that he had length in spades, hearts and diamonds. It was obvious that South was short in the majors. |
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


AT|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NBTW, you can play this hand double dummy afterward.|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It was as clear to Goren as it was to Belladonna that the hand would be played in a cross-ruff. To stop that, Goren led a trump. After the trump lead, Belladonna knew he was going to have to scramble for tricks somewhere other than with a cross-ruff. He won the first trick in his hand and led a, heart to the queen. That gave him an extra heart trick which Helen Sobel had not gotten in the other room, but it didn't solve his problem. |
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Belladonna cashed the ace of hearts, discarding a spade, ruffed a heart, and led the ten of spades. Goren went up with his ace and led another diamond. The net result was that Belladonna got seven trump tricks instead of the nine which Helen Sobel got in the closed room. With the three tricks from the majors, he had a total of ten, along with a score of minus fifty. |
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The lesson of this hand is that when one opponent shows a three-suited hand, you should almost always lead a trump. This is true even if you have a trump honor. Some few years ago there was quite a bit of cheering when the Italian method of showing three suits with one opening bid got them into a four-spade contract, making, while the Americans never got beyond the one level. Explicit systems can sometimes do wonderful things for you. |
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, there is another side to this story. The help they give to the defense is not so dramatic, Good defense doesn't get the attention or the cheers that bidding gets when it succeeds. I think it's about time we take a good look at just what the defenders are able to do when they are offered a road map by these explicit systems. Could it be that sometimes it is better to be more vague about your bidding?|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


NT|^B@2
There is an old theory that instead of it being wise to tell your partner everything about your hand, it is wiser to tell him only those things which will help him make a good decision. Smart opponents have a way of tuning in when you give a complete description.|

Now let's look at a part score. This hand features the Swedish version of the two-club opening bid with a three-suited hand. Based on the Marmic System, the bid was supposed to show 13 to 15 HCPs, so when Larsen, North, opened two clubs, he was fudging a bit. This hand was played in the 1953 World Championships, with the Swedes against the United States.|

Let's put ourselves in B. J. Becker's place and consider our opening lead. Usually a queen doubleton is a bad lead, and it is even worse when it is in trumps. However, the knowledge that North had a short suit and no establishable side suit suggested a trump lead. B. J. also knew that Crawford had a pretty good hand. Becker had only seven HCPs and the opponents had not bid to game. |

Don't get the idea that it is only three suit opening bids which can inspire a defender to open a trump, hoping to stop a cross-ruff. There are a lot of bidding sequences which will do this no matter what bidding method is used. We have looked at game hands, we have looked at part-score hands; now let's look at a slam hand where natural bidding methods were used.|

When dummy has fewer than four trumps are the same as the conditions which call for a trump lead to stop a cross-ruff.

One good reason for such a fear is that

Lasut led a trump every time he was in and the defenders got them all. An old adage in bridge states: If partner passes a takeout double, you must lead a trump.

In Bridge World magazine, a panel of experts was asked what they would do with the this hand if their left-hand opponent opened one diamond, their partner doubled, and their right-hand opponent passed. We are told that both sides were vulnerable.|mb|1dxp?|
PG| ***** 258 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The diamond suit is not solid, and if your left-hand opponent is sitting there with something like five or six diamonds to the ace, jack, nine, eight, your chances of pulling trumps are not all that good. Nonetheless, 15 out of 33 panelists voted for a penalty pass. |
PG| ***** 259 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That was more than voted for any other action. The next most popular choice was a bid of two notrump, with nine votes.|
PG| ***** 260 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In real life, the experts sometimes make do with considerably less than a solid trump suit. Witness next exhibit from the Ladies' Pairs Championship from the 1978 Olympiad Game.|

On this hand, Allen Walsh, of Australia, was able to select his own opening lead against a contract doubled at the one level. His partner doubled for a takeout, but Walsh converted it into a penalty double. The hand is from the World Championship Pair Event held in the 1978 Olympiad in New Orleans.|
PG| ***** 272 ***** |


NT|^B@2
At most of the tables, East-West played three notrump vulnerable, making either ten or eleven tricks. When Walsh and George Havas sat East-West, there was a different story. South opened the hand with one heart and West passed. Havas, East, made a takeout double. Although his opponents were not vulnerable, and Havas had passed in first seat, Walsh decided to defend one heart doubled.|

This last hand in this section on opening trump leads is reported to be from the First Interplanetary Bridge Tournament, where the people from Earth played the people from Mars. Personally, I am not too sure that this is the actual truth, but I can only give it to you as it has been reported to me.|
PG| ***** 294 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Both the Earthlings and the Martians reached six hearts, played by South. When the Earth people were defending, West led the queen of diamonds. The Martian South won the ace, cashed the ace of clubs and the ace of spades, and cross-ruffed spades and diamonds. |
PG| ***** 295 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Eventually, he gave up a trump trick to West's queen, taking an easy twelve tricks. The Earthlings had estimated that this was a tie board. They were surprised when they found that their teammate had gone set. They couldn't imagine how that had happened. Their teammates informed them that it all depended on the opening lead, but this only perplexed the unsuccessful defenders even more. |
PG| ***** 296 ***** |


NT|^B@2
True, West might have opened a trump, and kept South from trumping one spade; but then declarer would not have lost a trump trick. Finally, their teammates told them what the opening lead had been. The Martian had led the queen of hearts!|
PG| ***** 297 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now when declarer ruffed two spades in dummy, West's nine of hearts was promoted to a winner. Declarer had to lose a spade also to go down one.|
PG| ***** 298 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Unfortunately, the tournament was cut short because the Martians had to return home, so we did not find out some of the other tricks of the trade they claimed to have. But they promised to show us more at the next Interplanetary Tournament.|
