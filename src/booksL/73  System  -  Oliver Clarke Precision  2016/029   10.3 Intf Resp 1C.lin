cp||at|^*bMM:^*n|cp||at|   This week Oliver is moving house so John Lute has kindly offered to give the class.   

John uses different software which includes voice capability, this means that the lesson will be different in style from Oliver's text only presentation.

Having voice allows the lesson to be more interactive and sometimes more chatty.

Ironically this means that version I will present has less chat because the participants no longer need to type as much so 'their chat' does not get captured in the log from which I take the majority of this presentation.

As Oliver said at the start of this  mini-series of three lesson.  You can find the notes for these at:

^c ^*h http://bbo.pigpen.org.uk/AskingInterference.php ^*n. 
^^
and as always much more is available from the Oliver's Precision website at

^c ^*h http://bbo.pigpen.org.uk ^*n 
^^
One final point, I do have some of the introductory part of this class from when Oliver gave it in a previous year.  
^^
So now it is, over to John... (with two pages of 'old' Oliver mixed in early)|

Let us look first at  |cp|h-highlight|at|^*b[D.1]^*n|cp||at|


In  |cp|h-highlight|at|^*b[D.1]^*n|cp||at|  we look at where the interference occurs immediately over a Positive Response at the  1,  2  or  3 level.|

fp|t-title|cp|h-highlight|at|^*b[D.1]^*n|cp||at|     Intervention  over  a  POSITIVE Response to 1@C|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  So now we come to Interference immediately over a positive response to 1NT.

Here the scheme is vaguely similar to that for dealing with interference over an Asking Bid Response (Asking backwards), but with some significant changes.

The basis for these actions is that ^*b AGREEING TRUMPS ^*N is fundamentally the most important thing on our agenda, especially once they interfere.

That goes back to the basic "rules" underpinning our usage of Asking Bids.

So the scheme for interference over a Positive Response to 1@C is as follows: 
^^
(1)  If Responder's positive was in a ^*b SUIT ^*n
^d@2
PASS     ^f   from Opener is ALWAYS Gamma in Responder's suit
 
DOUBLE   ^f   is an Ask in the suit BELOW the interference or the last suit bid.

^eThis potentially includes bidding backwards to 1NT as Beta,  eg:      1@C  -  1@H  -  (2@C)  -  X 

^cthe only exception is when a  ^*b natural Gamma ^*n  is available in the ^*b NEXT SUIT UP, ^*n  in which case  

^dDOUBLE ^f   is still        "1 below"
 
^dPASS   ^f   becomes  "2 below"|

fp|t-title|cp|h-highlight|at|^*b[D.1]^*n|cp||at|     Intervention  over  a  POSITIVE Response to 1@C|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|

(2)  If Responder showed a ^*b BALANCED ^*n positive then 

^cPASS by Opener is ALWAYS Beta.

^bAgain, the only exception is when a "normal" low Beta of 1NT is still available   ie:

^c 1@C   -   1@S   -   (X)   -   ???       in which case  1NT  is still  Beta  and  PASS is  "2 below".



Rule (2) above also applies if there is interference immediately over a "positive" double by Responder    eg: 

^c 1@C   -   (2@S)   -   X   -   (3@S)   -   ???     X  would be Alpha in Hearts and Pass would be Beta

^cA 'positive double' is when the interference over  1@C  is at least at the level of  2@H.

^cBut essentially, each partnership can pick their own level for when a positive doubles kick in 

^dSo   1@C   -   (2@D)   -   X    ^j   is just the usual 5-7 any shape 
^dBut  1@C   -   (2@H)   -   X    ^j   is a "positive" double,  showing 8+ with no good bid at present  
                        ^h   PASS ^j   is any  0-7 
^^^^

cp|red|at|^*blute57:^*n|cp||at|  

Looking more at the ^*b Suit Positive ^*n and ^*b Balanced Positive ^*n options listed earlier.


When Beta (Pass) is used, it can be followed by Opener using ^*b Iota ^*n (continuing onward with the Asking Bid sequence)  

^*bOR^*n   by Opener making an ^*b HoC ^*n bid (the HoC bid stops the Asking Bid sequence and partnership starts searching for 4-4 fits).


^*b2NT ^*n by Opener is generally ^*b HoC ^*n (Handover of Captaincy).  However, there are exceptions when opponents make completely nebulous interference or psychic bids.  

Under those conditions, ^*b 2NT ^*n is ^*b Alpha ^*n in the suit that has been displaced by the opponent’s nebulous or psychic interference.
^^
It is imperative that  BOTH  Opener and Responder know what the opponent’s 2-level interference applies.

fp|t-title|cp|h-highlight|at|^*b[D.1]^*n|cp||at|     Intervention  over  a  POSITIVE Response to 1@C|fp||at|        continued^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*blute57:^*n|cp||at|  When is  ^*b 2NT^*n,   ^*b HoC ^*n and when is it  ^*b Alpha ^*n  in the displaced suit ?


If the opponent’s bid is a Panama or Suction-style bid that doesn't show, or may not show, the suit actually bid

THEN ^*b 2NT ^*n by Opener is always  ^*b Alpha ^*n  in the suit displaced by the opponent’s bid        eg:

^c1@C    -    1@S(bal)    -    ^*b(^*n2@H(@S/Minors)^*b)^*n    -    2NT                ^o 2NT  here is ^*b Alpha in Hearts.^*n


Above  @h's  is the suit ^*b displaced ^*n by the Opps.    This is ^*b the ^*n suit that ^*b they have bid ^*n  but ^*b may not^*n  hold.




If the opponent’s  2-level  overcall is ostensibly natural, then ^*b 2NT ^*n is ^*b HoC^*n,  handing over the captaincy



An example of the more common case

^c1@C    -    1@S(bal)    -    ^*b(^*n2@H(shows @h)^*b)^*n     -    2NT            ^o 2NT  here is ^*b HoC^*n.




An Opponents psyche bid will have to be exposed by some other means.|

fp|t-title|cp|h-highlight|at|^*b[D.1]^*n|cp||at|     Intervention  over  a  POSITIVE Response to 1@C|fp||at|        continued^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*blute57:^*n|cp||at|   As Asker we skip over  NO Trumps  whenever we 'backwards Ask'.
^c      The one exception, is 1NT, the system allows us to backwards Ask to ^*b 1NT ^*n and use it as ^*b Low-level ^*n Beta. 

Of course from Teller's perspective  No Trumps  is ^*b ALWAYS ^*n counted as a  STEP  in the responses.


|fp|t-title|at|As a small refresher   -   The Asker and   3 No Trumps|fp||at|
^c@2
Askers bid of   3 NT   is a  ^*b SIGN OFF ^*N  WHENEVER  

^da  MINOR  is agreed as trumps  
^d@2
^cOR  
^e    when a  MAJOR  is being agreed  

AND    the previous response to  Alpha / Theata / Iota  was the  mininum  one step response 
^b@2
^^
This can come into play when intervention makes  3NT  into a  'possible'  Relay Beta,   eg:

^c1@c   -   1@h(suit pos)   -   ^*b(^*n2@s^*b)^*n   -   Pass(Gamma in @h)   -   ^*b(^*n3@s^*b)^*n   -   ^*bX^*n(no top hons in @h)    -    3NT(^*b???^*n)


The double,  ^*bX^*n  by partner is a  1 step  response (xxxxx)   so the the ^*b 3NT ^*n bid is now a ^*b sign-off ^*n and not  Beta.

Therefore  4@c  now  becomes  Beta    and  Epsilon  in clubs would now be  5@c.|

Intervention in front of Asker always kills off any 'possible'  Relay Beta,  with the exception of 1NT as covered above.

So we can ^*b never ^*n 'backwards bid'  to any other 'possible' Relay Betas,  such as   2@C,  2@D,  and  2@H.|

fp|t-title|cp|h-highlight|at|^*b[D.2]^*n|cp||at|   Pre-emptive Intervention  over a  Positive RESPONSE  to 1@c  at the  4  Level|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*blute57:^*n|cp||at|   This similar to |cp|h-highlight|at|^*b[C.2]^*n|cp||at| dealing with   Pre-emptive Intervention over the RESPONSE to an ^*b Asking Bid^*n.

This type of interference is much less common but it does allow us to bloody the axe against opponents who think our system is ONLY about Asking bids.

Askers (Opener’s) options:

^c DOUBLE ^g is ^*b Gamma ^*n when Responder has shown a  SUIT     and   ^*b Beta ^*n otherwise.

^d UNLESS ^g the next suit up is natural Gamma (Responder's suit)
 
^d THEN   ^g DOUBLE   is ^*b Alpha ^*n in the suit  ONE  below


^c PASS ^g is @2now ^*b Lebensohl ^*n forcing responder to ^*b DOUBLE ^*n

asker (Opener) will now either  PASS  for penalties, or make a sign-off bid.
^b@2

If Opener makes a Lebensohl PASS and then subsequently bids a suit as sign-off, Responder should normally respect Opener’s wishes.

But ^*b IF ^*n Responder has a significantly better hand than Opener would expect
 
^m (by definition there has been no Beta Ask in the sequence) 

^*b THEN ^*n Responder CAN use her discretion and bid on over a  Lebensohl PASS sign-off^*n.|

fp|t-title|cp|h-highlight|at|^*b[D.2]^*n|cp||at|   Pre-emptive Intervention  over a  Positive RESPONSE  to 1@c  at the  4  Level|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*blute57:^*n|cp||at|   New suit bids by Opener are ^*b Alpha ^*n but without reference to Controls,

merely asking if Responder has support
^d@2
^c|fp|t-title|at|Alpha|fp||at|                       
1  step   ^f shows ^h No^i Support
2  steps  ^f shows      ^i Support  ^*b  Qxx ^*n/^*b xxxx^*n   or  better
^b@2

( This is an even more compressed scale than used against pre-emption over an Asking bid response see Ch 10.1 )

If Responder shows support, then a relay over the stepped response is Relay Beta. 

Note all this only applies after pre-emptive interference immediately over a positive response to 1@C Opening.

If we've had other Asks before the opponent pre-emptive interference then no bid by Opener can ever be Alpha by definition.


Given the availability of the  Pass-Double Lebensohl sequence,  

if Responder has shown a suit, then a fast 4NT by Opener is Beta, agreeing Responder's suit if one has been shown. 

If Responder has shown a balanced hand, then a fast 4NT by Opener is natural and "to play",

^c but shows less strength in the opponent’s suit than a slow 4NT would show.|

cp|red|at|^*blute57:^*n|cp||at|   Lastly, we have the general rules for dealing with interference over a Positive Response to our 1@C Opening where the interference occurs immediately over a Positive Response is pre-emptive and occurs at the 5-level. 

This type of interference is even much less common and does tend to allow us to bloody the opponents who think our system is ONLY about Asking bids.
^^

The general action by Opener is similar to that over  4 level  pre-empts


^c DOUBLE  ^g now ^*b denies ^*n a  1st or 2nd  round control of the opponent’s suit 

^g   and ^*b invites ^*N Responder to continue ^*b IF ^*n they have  1st or 2nd  round control


^c PASS ^g is ^*b Lebensohl ^*n forcing responder to ^*b DOUBLE ^*n


^c OTHER ^g immediate bids by Opener are ^*b invitational (to slam) ^*n rather than being an Alpha Ask.|

ht|d|at|^^|
cp||at|^*bMM:^*n|cp||at|  We all know we have to alert when playing  'proper'  bridge.

The laws of the game say that what we have to put in the alert is  ^*b our agreement with partner ^*n about that bid.

While creating these bridge movies, I have gone through and added to, or amended, many of the alerts that were in the original text.

I have changed them from being ^*b REAL ^*n alerts, that you should give to real opponents, and have replaced them with ^*b STUDY ^*n alerts.   Study alerts are only useful to students of Oliver's Precision.  Of course in many cases no changes were needed.   For example    1@c     16+ Any dist except 16-23 4441

It is particularly important that we make the alerts for  ^*b Asking bids and their responses^*n,  as clear as possible

	    ^c ^*b Study Alert ^*n           ^i ^*b Real Alert ^*n                ^o ^*b It would be great if you could add ^*n
     ^b      @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@- ^h       @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-   ^n       @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-
		^c Beta    Relay Beta ...          ^i Gen Ctrl Ask                    ^o A = 2,  K = 1 
		^c Alpha                           ^i Asking  in                      ^o Trump ...
		^c Gamma                           ^i Asking  in partners suit        ^o Trump ...
		^c Epsilon                         ^i Specific Ctrl Ask               ^o in ... 
		^c Hxx                             ^i Hxx                             ^o in ... 
		^c none  or  1st & 2nd             ^i none  or  1st & 2nd             ^o [xxx, AKx(x)]
		^c 3rd rd ctrl                     ^i 3rd rd ctrl                     ^o [xx, Qxx(x), Qx]
		
An easy mistake in reply to an Epsilon is when, say, you hold ^*b Q76 ^*n in the suit, and so give only ^*b Qxx ^*n in the alert.   THAT  IS  WRONG.  The agreement is ^*b 3rd round control ^*n and that is what should be told to the opps.   

The ^*b ethical ^*n problem with telling too much to your opps is that it disadvantages the other pairs who will play your opponents cards.|

at|        At this point Terry knows is that Jen has  @cxx  and either all three missing Kings   OR
OR   Jen has the @hA and one of the Kings.    If her holding is the 3 Kings then 6 is the automatic bid.   
If Jen has the @hAK(x) then there will be somewhere to throw either the @s/@d loser so again 6 is bid.
If Jen has the @hA and the @dK (likely after the @d positive) then also having the @dQ takes care of the extra loser. 
If Jen has the @hA and the @sK then again it only takes the @sQ to make 6.  
If Jen has the @hA and neither Queen then Jen having just the @hJ extra will mean a 50/50 finesse for 6.  
So Terry bids...|
