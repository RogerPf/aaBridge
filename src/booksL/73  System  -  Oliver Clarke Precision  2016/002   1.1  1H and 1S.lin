At the 2 level (or 3 level) 11+ or shape.  Forcing to  ^*bat least 2NT^*n  (which may be Leb).

A Delayed-Game Raise (DGR) normally shows a hand with trump support and a decent side-suit and normally is a MILD slam try (if Opener is max, has good controls and a fit with your suit).  

Many pairs play that a DGR ^*b denies ^*n possession of a side-suit singleton in addition.


(Point count raises normally go via the forcing one no-trump response.)

(Weak raises are bid as a direct raise of the major.)

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Hi Everyone and welcome to today's Precision Club session, in which we'll start to look in earnest at the Precision Club. Today and for the next couple of weeks we'll be taking a look at the Precision 1@H & 1@S Openings & Responses. Firstly, a very warm welcome to any new faces. Nice to see so many I do not recognise. :)

Let me reiterate what I said last week. It will REALLY help you if you learn this system as a partnership It really helps to be able to practice this system together So if your regular partner isn't here, persuade them to come along If you don't have one, why not try hooking up with someone else that's at these sessions.
  
The other thing is this. There are quite a number of people on BBO who now play this system. Most of them are people you will see mentioned on the "Mentoring Scheme" page on the website. If you see two of them playing together, the chances are that they'll be using this system, so kibitz them. Good to get to know the system by seeing it in action. 

If you have not already done so, please have a look at the notes I have prepared on Precision Club bidding. You can find these on: ^*h http://bbo.pigpen.org.uk ^*n You might want to have these onscreen in the background for reference during the session.

The Notes on Major Suit openings can be found on ^*h http://bbo.pigpen.org.uk/1h.php ^*n and ^*h http://bbo.pigpen.org.uk/1s.php ^*n. There are some slight differences between the two, for obvious reasons, but those differences will only affect us NEXT week. 

At this stage, let me plug the website: The website notes are the 100% most up-to-date description of this system, and any tweaks to the system or clarifications that appear needed appear THERE first of all. 

The downloadable Word and PDF notes are updated a lot less regularly. Please use the site: It has a wealth of stuff there.

nt|^b@2^z@3

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Today we're going to start looking at the 1@H and 1@S Openings. In general, the sequences for each are very similar, so I'm going to treat them as one and will mention when there is any significant difference. We will NOT finish 1@H and 1@S tonight.  

The ideas I'm going to introduce may not all be new to you, but some probably will be. As well as the Forcing No Trump and Splinters, over the next few weeks we'll be looking at Mini-Splinters, Fit-showing Jump-Shifts, Romex Trial Bids and Transfer responses after they double our 1@H or 1@S Opening. 

For tonight we're mainly going to look at the requirements for the Major Suit opening, direct suit raises, change-of-suit responses and the Forcing 1NT Response 1@H and 1@S Openings both show 11-15 points and at least a 5-card suit in the suit you bid. If you open 1@H then, if you have a spade suit as well, it is definitely SHORTER. 

With 5-5 in the Majors, we always open 1@S rather than 1@H and, as we'll see later in the Course, we actually open 2NT with exactly 5-5 in the Majors (but for the time being we'll use 1@S). So let me emphasise this: If you open 1@H, your Spades are ALWAYS going to be shorter than your Hearts.

If you hold @S987652, @HAKQJ10, @DAx, @C-, I don't care that the Hearts are very much stronger: OPEN 1@S If you have 11-15 HCP and a 5-card Major, you MUST open the hand 1@H or 1@S, because the 1@D, 1NT and 2@C Openings all specifically DENY holding a 5-card Major. 

As we'll see leter in the series, the only exception to this is when you have 11-15 HCP and are EXACTLY 5-5 in the Majors. We use a Multi-style 2NT opening, and that is one of the options for that opening.

So if the bidding goes 1@S-2@C 2@H-3@D(4SF) 3@H...   

Now Opener is KNOWN to be at least 6-5 in the Majors rather than 5-5 Because the Opening is limited to 15 points maximum, this takes a considerable amount of pressure OFF responder. In ACOL, Standard American or 2/1, the Opening could show a hand as strong as 20 points, so responder is forced to manufacture a reply with 6 or more points.
|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at| In Precision, it is much easier to tell when you're definitely in part-score territory, and partner can happily pass the opening out if they've nothing constructive to say.  

Eg: @Sxx  @HQJxx  @DJxxx  @CKxx.  If partner Opens 1@S and you hold this hand, you know immediately that the partnership is limited to 22 points at most and can happily pass 1@S.  

Typically, the kind of hand with which, in Standard American, you would bid 1NT just to keep the bidding open with a balanced 6-8 points and no support for Opener's Major in case partner is really strong, you would normally pass in Precision.  1M-Pass is a surprisingly common sequence in precision.


Any Questions?

1aphrodite:  What if no supp? 

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at| If you have, for example, a singleton in Opener's Major and a weak hand, I would still just recommend that you pass.

If you have 8 or 9 HCP and support for the other three suits, you could consider a 1NT response, but whenever I do that, partner ALWAYS rebids 2 of their Major and so I'm in the same boat, just one level higher than I needed to be.

The point if that if you start coming into the bidding with a 6-count opposite 11-15, you really need to have support for Opener's Major because Opener might only have a grotty 11-count , so you could get into trouble if you CANNOT support their Major It's the old old thing of getting out at as low a level as possible if you have a misfit 



mulefloyd:^*n What is the definition of a weak hand for responder? pointwise 

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at| I would say 0-7
|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3

Ruah:  ten points at least to respond? 

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at| It's definitely NOT the case that you need 10 HCP to make a response (more on that later tonight).



themarc:^*n But against aggressive bidders doesn't this give them an easy entry to auction?

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at| So if you have few points and a misfit with partner, PASS!. I don't care if it gives Opps an easy entry into the bidding.

We WANT them to bid, because we don't like partner's suit we would FAR rather defend against them playing in a suit in which we have more cards. :)  On the hand given earlier   @Sxx  @HQJxx  @DJxxx  @CKxx   there is just ZERO incentive for you to bid anything.  

If partner is minimum, it's Opps' hand.  Who knows, if they come into the bidding, they might end up playing in your Hearts.

But one thing is for certain, there is obsolutely NO chance that you're going to miss anything because partner is limited to a MAXIMUM of 15 HCP.
^^^^
Anyone unclear on any of the requirements for opening 1@H or 1@S, or what you need to make ANY kind of response?

fp|t-title|at|Direct Raises      over     1@H  and  1@S|fp||at|

In Precision Direct suit raises (eg: 1@S-2@S, 1@H-3@H, or 1@S-4@S) are mainly pre-emptive in nature and based on trump support and ruffing values rather than a sound point count as with Limit Raises in other systems. 

^d So  ^f 1@S - 2@S   is NOT a "Constructive Raise" 

       ^f 1@S - 3@S   is NOT a "Limit Raise"  

They are mainly PRE-EMPTIVE raises, so trump support and a ruffing value in one of the side suits is what matters rather than HCP.  


Thus -

The fact that they are mainly pre-emptive raises doesn't mean that you're expecting the bid to fail @- far from it, but they are not invitational at all, but rather trying to deny Opps the chance to get into the bidding easily, with a hand containing good trump support and "shape" rather than a solid point-count based raise.

The example above is perhaps a bit pushy given no controls in the West hand, but it serves to make the point.|

Here we have,    a ruffing value in Clubs,    3-card trump,    support 7 HCP.    So we are fine with  2@S.

Not worth 3@S because we don't have as good trump support as the previous hand and our shape is not as good. |

nt|^z@3^b@2|
at|^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  The 2@S response is still mainly pre-emptive Opposite 11 HCP.

It might STILL be their hand and we have NO game ambitions here, so the purpose behind 2@S is still pre-emptive.

Playing Standard American, this has to be a "constructive raise", because partner might be sat there with just less than a  2@C  Opening but opposite 11-15, we're not , normally in game territory.

at|themarc:    ? What if responder had a constructive or limit raise, say also @DA would go through the forcing NT ?

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  That depends entirely on their HCP, shape, trump support, etc.

Constructive or limit raises  can often go via 1NT, but you might make a change-of-suit response first, for example depends on the quality of the suit etc,   back to that in a minute.

nt|^z@3^b@2|
at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Hands that want to make a solid point-count based raise, typically go via the Forcing No Trump (see later).

As in most systems, a simple change of suit response  ie:  1@H - 1@S   is forcing for one round.  

Similarly a new suit at the 3-level is also deemed forcing for one round.
  
The sequence   1@H - 1@S   only guarantees a 4-card suit.
  
In this respect Precision is little different to, for example, Standard American.  In Precision a 2 over 1 bid is normally forcing to ^*bat least 2NT^*n. 

A Delayed-Game Raise (DGR) normally denotes a hand with trump support and a decent side-suit and normally is a MILD slam try (if Opener is max, has good controls and a fit with your suit).  

Many pairs play that a DGR denies possession of a side-suit singleton in addition. (See splinters etc later)|

fp|t-title|at|Summary  of  Suit Responses     to     1@h   and  1@s      by Opener|fp||at|
^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at| We do not bid over a Major suit opening if we have nothing constructive to say.  

Direct raises are universally PRE-EMPTIVE rather than being limit bids (so probably less HCP, but more shape and better trump support).  

Change-of-suit responses are little different than they would be in Acol or Standard American.  

In the example on the previous page (Teach 3), the 3@H by East, not a direct suit raise, is far more like the limit raise you'd see in Standard American.  

One thing at this stage: Jump-shifts over 1@H and 1@S are NOT game-forcing in this system.  We will see those next week.  

They are all mildly invitational to game in Opener's Major. (Mini-splinters and fit-showing jump-shifts).

So please do not get into the habit of leaping about all over the place just to show strength.  We try to avoid doing that in this system beause we're just using up OUR bidding space.

Mini splinters are something we will look at next week.

fp|t-title|at|Forcing 1NT    response  to   1 @H  and  1 @S |fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  As in 2/1, the 1NT Response to a Major Suit Opening is artificial and can be used by a number of different hand types (but it's treated slightly differently than in 2/1). 

With one exception these are most often reasonably balanced hands. If they have trump support then they are worth at least a solid raise to the 2-level, and if without trump support they will normally contain the values for a natural raise to 2NT. 

If you end up supporting Opener's Major, the FNT response normally denotes a hand that does NOT have a strong side-suit. Often you will be relatively balanced Let me stress this: 

We do  ^*bNOT^*n  bid 1NT just because we have 6-7 points and no good support for partner's major, just to keep the bidding open. 

In Precision, 1M-1NT is a CONSTRUCTIVE bid, normally showing AT least a GOOD 2-level balanced limit raise in the Major or AT LEAST an 11-point balanced hand. 

We also often go this route with a slam-going responding hand (but the slam going hands are for later, when we start using the Asking Bids). 

The other main hand-type that goes via this route is where responder has no tolerance for Opener's major, a weak hand and a LONG (6+) suit of their own,  eg:    @Sx  @HJxx  @DKJ10xxxx  @CQx    would qualify if partner opened 1@S. 


(Where Responder is not a passed hand we drop this alternative once we start using Asking Bids, by the way, because we use this sequence for slam-going hands with trump support).

at|South here cannot bid 2@D directly (a Precision, 2 over 1 bid, is forcing to 2NT) so this is a device (also used in 2/1) to enable them to bid 2@D "to play".  

As I said earlier, we DROP this response by an unpassed hand once we start using Asking Bids but it's ALWAYS available to a passed hand.

at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  If responder bids 1NT over a Major suit opening, often called just the Forcing No Trump, and as the name suggests, it is forcing for 1 round then opener rebids on the following lines (^*bin order of priority^*n) @-

^c@.  Shows a second suit if held ^i  @- Reverse into Spades shows max values (15 or good 14 HCP)
       ^i  @- Jump-rebid in a second suit shows max values and at least 5-5

^c@.  Rebids a 6-card or a very strong 5-card suit.   Jump Rebid shows a maximum with a good 6-card suit

^c@.  Rebids 2NT with a set-up 6-card or longer suit   eg: AKQJxx 

^c@.  With 5332 shape hands, opener rebids their cheapest 3-card  ^*bminor^*n  at the 2-level

So showing a second suit if we have one is the top priority, because it's the most constructive rebid we can make, telling partner more about our hand.  In the absence of a second 4+ card suit, we can rebid a 6-card Major.  

The 2NT rebid is a special bid and doesn't occur very often.  It's just telling partner that we can expect to make 6 tricks in our Major, so 3NT a decent bet even opposite a singleton if partner has some decent values.  

Lastly If we are 5332 shape, we rebid our CHEAPEST 3-card Minor, hence the 2@C Alert here.

^e^*bMM:^*n^f  @2You can use any of the ^*bFlow back arrow   <^*n   to pop back to the previous page that shows the hand  ^*bOR^*n  if you have a large screen,  open a |cp|red|at|second copy of ^*baaBridge^*n|cp||at| and show the deal on it.  Use the ^*bNav Bar^*n below to quickly get to the correct page.

^b@2|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  This makes it easy (in the early stages when no asking bids, or when partner is a passed hand) for Responder to show their suit cheaply when they have the "long weak suit" variety of 1NT Response.

When opener rebids their Major or jump-shifts into a different suit, they must be Upper range for their opening (a good 14 or 15), and the jump-shifts in a second suit MUST be a 5-5+ hand.

|cp|red|at|^b@2|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Any questions on Opener's rebids?

billyjef:  What about the  4-5-2-2  hand pattern?

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|^c@2^dGood question.  If upper range, no problem, just reverse into Spades.  If mid-range, then just lie and rebid a 2-card Minor would be my suggestion.  You might come unstuck very occasionally, but most often the 1NT hand is going to end up either supporting your Major at the 2-level or higher, or bidding No Trumps at the 2-level or higher.

If a rock-bottom minimum, then I would definitely consider PASSING the hand and coming in later if the opportunity permits 4531 and 4513 hand are less of a problem, for obvious reasons since we have a 3-card Minor we can rebid without misleading partner too much. 


^b@2|fp|t-title|at|Resonders Rebid|fp||at|
Over Opener's rebid, responder passes, gives preference, bids No Trumps or raises a suit of opener's as appropriate given their hand-type. 

With the long weak suit type of hand, responder passes (if Opener has bid their suit) or bids their suit at the minimum level.  Eg: 1@H - 1NT - 2@C - 2@D  

So Responder does whatever seems most appropriate they can support (or give preference to) Opener's first suit at whatever level, or pass or bid No Trumps at the appropriate level, or show their long weak suit.

magicspy:  5-6-x-x, should we open 1@H first?

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Yes with  56xx  open the @H's first.

Ruah:  then   if you were weak,  after the 1 nt response,  you would rebid 2 hearts?

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Yes, but that's mainly on the basis that if your HCP are in your long suits, almost any 11-15 hand will have enough enough playing strength to justify a reverse into spades.  IMHO    @SKQxxx  @HAQxxxx  @Dx  @Cx   is worth a reverse any day of the week.

If you're uncomfortable with that, for whatever reason, then open the Spades first but bear in mind what I said earlier: We open 2NT with 11-15 and 5-5 in the Majors, (except in ACBL<shudder>-land LOL), so if you open 1@S and later show a 5th @H, partner will assume you're 6-5 rather than 5-6.

When we get to look at Asking Bids, we will see that we dispense with the long-weak suit type of hand in favour of using relays over Opener's rebid to initiate an Asking Bid sequence based on support for Opener's Major.
 
For example  1@H - 1NT - 2@C - 2@D  would be an Asking Bid about Hearts, but until you start using Asking Bids, the long-weak-suit type can be a useful escape route.  

Even when we've started using Asking Bids and have stopped using this kind of sequence to show weak hands with a long suit and no tolerance for Opener's Major, this route is STILL available when Responder is a passed hand (and therefore cannot be 16+ with trump support).  

The "no tolerance" bit is very important, though I would suggest that that kind of sequence shows at most a singleton in Opener's Major.  

The only exception might be if I am REALLY weak and playing the hand in MY suit becomes even more critical so partner opens 1@S and I have  @Sxx  @Hxxx  @DQ98xxxx  @Cx  I might consider escaping to @D's via 1NT but not with a 6-count (just pass 1@S).

While creating these bridge movies, I have gone through and added to, or amended, many of the alerts that were in the original text.

I have changed them from being ^*b REAL ^*n alerts, that you should give to real opponents, and have replaced them with ^*b STUDY ^*n alerts.   Study alerts are only useful to students of Oliver's Precision.  Of course in many cases no changes were needed.   For example    1@c     16+ Any dist except 16-23 4441

It is particularly important that we make the alerts for  ^*b Asking bids and their responses^*n,  as clear as possible

An easy mistake in reply to an Epsilon is when, say, you hold ^*b Q76 ^*n in the suit, and so give only ^*b Qxx ^*n in the alert.   THAT  IS  WRONG.  The agreement is ^*b 3rd round control ^*n and that is what should be told to the opps.   

The ^*b ethical ^*n problem with telling too much to your opps is that it disadvantages the other pairs who will play your opponents cards.|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Don't forget that (as shown above) a MAX hand with 5-5 can jump-rebid, to 3@h's, over the 1NT response.

The 3@H rebid just encourages partner to bid game when they have 8-10 with a fit for one or both of your suits.

The other thing here is that West is perhaps too nice to go via 1NT.
I would bid 2@C over the 1@S opening and over openers response of 2@H, I would then bid 4@S,   ^*bbut^*n  over 3@H...|

Once we start using Asking Bids, these hands would start bidding with  1@S - 1NT - 3@H - 4@C (asking about @S) and then into an Asking Bid sequence.
