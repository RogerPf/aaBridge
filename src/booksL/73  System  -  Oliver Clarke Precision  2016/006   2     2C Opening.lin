at|^e@2 3 Clubs 


natural and constructive  non-forcing

about 9 - 10 points

decent club support

This bid does not deny possession of a 4-card major

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Hi Everyone and welcome to today's Precision Club session, in which we'll be taking a close look at the Precision 2@C Opening & Responses.

If you have not already done so, please have a look at the notes I have prepared on Precision Club bidding.  You can find these on: ^*hhttp://bbo.pigpen.org.uk^*n    The 2@C Notes can be found at ^*hhttp://bbo.pigpen.org.uk/2c.php^*n


The Precision 2@C Opening shows 11-15 points and is NOT forcing, as with all the Intermediate Precision Openings.

It always promises at least a 5-card club suit of reasonable quality.

^cKQxxx, QJ109xx, KJ10xx are all fine     Q9xxxx or J109xx are NOT!

The 2@C Opening shows either a decent 6-card @Club suit (QJ10xxx would be an absolute minimum, usually better than that) or a 5-card Club suit in a hand that also contains a 4-card major suit.

The suit quality requirements are not quite as stringent when you have a 4-5 shape hand.   So in hand with shape and values like   @sK52 @hA10 @d10 @cQJ86432   the club suit is about adequate given the 7th club.

But with only a 6-card suit headed by QJx, you might consider the alternative (1@D).  A club suit of  QJ10xxx  is okay.

The club suit needs to be of a reasonable quality because 

^c(a) you're opening at the 2-level, not the 1-level and 

^c(b) partner will more often pass the opening out with a weak hand, whatever their Club holding.

nt|^b@2^z@3|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Here South's double of 2@S is essentially for t/o showing @H in case North has the 5-4 hand, but happy to compete to 3@C if he does not.

Hands with a 5-card or longer Club suit that do NOT meet these requirements are opened with either 1@D or 1NT, depending on range and shape.

nt|^b@2^z@3|
at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  It is worth noting at this stage that, hands containing a reasonable 6-card @Club suit AND a 4-card Major are opened with 3@C Roman, which we'll come to later in the series.

If partner does respond to the 2@C Opening, subsequent bidding is primarily geared to playing in No Trumps if possible, or in an 8-card or better major suit fit, but Club contracts are also routine.

It is quite difficult, if not impossible, to arrive in a Diamond contract.

That's mainly because Responder cannot introduce Diamonds naturally, because the 2@D response to 2@C is an artificial enquiry (coming in a bit).


As stated earlier, the 2@C Opening is not forcing, and because Opener has promised a decent suit, the most common action from a weak hand which has nothing better to suggest will be to pass.

Responses to the 2@C Opening are almost completely natural and, for the most, part non-forcing.

The main exception to this is the 2@D Forcing Relay which ANY decent responding hand uses to explore for the right contract.


|fp|t-title|at|The Non-Forcing Responses to 2@C    @-   The 2@H and 2@S Responses|fp||at|

The 2@H and 2@S Responses promise at least a 5-card suit (more commonly a 6-card suit, though) and show 7-10 points (never more than 10).

They are non-forcing and should  ^*bnot^*N  be used on stronger hands.

at|^^^^That doesn't preclude Opener continuing if they have a maximum hand with support for Responder's Major.
|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


bt||
nt|^b@2^z@3|
at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  If responder is weak with a long suit and has no tolerance for @C, the likelyhood is that the hand is better played in THEIR suit.

So the 2@C-2@H and 2@C-2@S sequences are drop dead bids UNLESS Opener is upper range AND has a decent fit for Responder's Major.  In extremis, as I said, you can make these bids with a 5-card suit, but more normally, they ought to be 6+

The 2@C-2NT response shows 11-12 points balanced, and normally denies possession of a 4-card major (otherwise Responder would normally bid 2@D).  Bidding proceeds naturally.

3@C from Opener is "to play" with a marked weakness in one outside suit (normally a Major).  Failing that, Opener can start bidding stops "upwards" if they don't pass 2NT or bid 3NT.

A Single raise in Clubs (2@C-3@C) normally shows about a 9-count and good trump support and is a mild invitation.  Responder may be balanced or unbalanced, but usually relatively balanced (else 4@C from Responder) and so Opener, with around 9 or 10 hcp, can bid 3NT or stops upwards.

That takes care of the NON-forcing responses to 2@C.



|fp|t-title|at|The Alpha Responses to  2@C    @-    3@D,  3@H  and  3@S|fp||at|

3@D,  3@H  and  3@S   are game-forcing (Alpha Asking Bids once we're using Asking Bids).  

They will normally ^*bNOT^*n have decent support for Clubs, and will often be a distributional 2-suiter where responder needs to take control.

fp|t-title|at|The Forcing Relay  2@d  Response|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  The 2@D Response to a 2@C Opening shows 11+ points in a hand worth a solid invitation to game.

It is a forcing relay and subsequent bidding is not natural.

2@C - 2@D MUST be alerted, as well as most of the subsequent rebids.

Almost all strong hands go this route except for distributional 2-suited hands WITHOUT Club support (which might use an Asking Bid sequence starting with Alpha -  3@D,  3@H  and  3@S).

The structure over the 2@D Forcing Relay is fairly constrained, with responses by Opener having fairly exact meanings.

There is a potential further forcing relay of 3@D over Opener's rebid, which we'll get to shortly.


^*bMM:^*n  At this point in the lesson Oliver introduced some 'alternative simplifications', which I have omitted, as they are not used in the web site notes or in the example hands.  

His original text is, of course, available on the web site under Teaching, download the chat log for the 2@C Opening Session. 

Once consequence is that the next section follows the site notes for the 2@d Response.  The notes can be found at -

^d^*hhttp://bbo.pigpen.org.uk/2c.php##2d^*n      Title:  ^*b2@D Forcing Enquiry^*n

So his means that in a few places, I have had to put words in to Oliver's mouth (pen) to match the text on his site.

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Incidentally: This is the reason why we tend to play   

2@C - 2@D - 2@H - 3@D - 3@S     as showing a MAXIMUM            ^*b3415^*n  hand (because we've gone past 3@H), and 

2@C - 2@D - 2@S - 3@D - 3@H     as showing a LOWER-RANGE  ^*b4315^*n  hand (because we can still play in 3@S)


The 2@H and 3@S rebids show maximum hands if Opener has a 3-card holding in the other Major, whereas the 2@S and 3@H rebids show minimum hands in that situation.

I do not propose to go into the reasons for this now, but you can look it up on the site.  Have a look at the ^*hhttp://bbo.pigpen.org.uk/2c.php##2d^*nwebsite notes^*x for full details of how we suggest you play Opener's rebids in a Major over the 2@D Enquiry.

at|In some of the Major suit openings where we ended up showing a singleton by bidding the suit below, we then used the singleton suit as Ace Asking.  Once Asking Bids come into things, we can  use it (the singleton suit) as a Beta Asking Bid. For now we'll use it as RKCB 0314.  

Opener has shown an UPPER-range hand by effectively reversing into his 3-card Spades over the 3@D Enquiry, so justifying the 4@d enquiry.  Not really worth asking for Kings here East has a @S singleton and West known to have a @D singleton, and we have a BIG 2-suited fit in Clubs and Hearts.

|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  The sequence  2@C-2@D-2NT  shows a 6-card @Club suit with 2 suits outside stopped.

Now 3@C from responder is to play and 3@D asks which 2 suits. Opener bids 
    ^cthe major suit they CANNOT stop,   or
    ^c3NT with no diamond stop.
    
So over  2@C - 2@D - 2NT - 3@D -
    ^c3@H shows Spades and Diamonds Stopped
    ^c3@S shows the RED suits stopped, and
    ^c3NT shows the MAJORS stopped.
    
The easy way to remember this is that over the 3@D 2nd Enquiry you can only "show" one suit, so you show the suit you CANNOT stop, promising stops in the other two.

The sequence  2@C - 2@D - 3@C  shows a 6-card club suit with only 1 suit outside stopped. Responder can pass this and 3@D asks for more details and this time Opener bids the major suit they CAN stop, or 3NT with a diamond stop.

Again, since you can only show ONE suit, this time you show the suit you CAN stop. In both cases the 3NT rebid relates to the @D suit.

So over  2@C - 2@D - 3@C - 3@D - 
    ^c3@H shows Hearts Stopped
    ^c3@S shows Spades stopped, and
    ^c3NT shows Diamonds stopped.

at|Since Responder's hand is a complete unknown, they are the Captain over the response to the 3@D 2nd Enquiry.

So, for example, Opener has shown that they have Hearts stopped, and Responder now bids 4@H rather than 3NT, this is 100% "to play" since Responder might well have a 5 or even a 6-card Major and still go via the 2@D forcing Enquiry.|

Since South MUST have the Q@H, there is no room for them to have any other kings beside the K@C.  If we wanted to ask for kings we could use 4NT, but that might be ambiguous, so better to use 5@D asking for Kings.|

lute57:  Is it OK to decrease the club suit discipline in 3rd seat?

|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  I prefer not, but 2@C IS a pretty pre-emptive opening, so if that suits your style, go for it.


The sequence 2@C - 2@D - 3@D is effectively a "free" sequence.

I tend to use it to show hands with 4405 shape but you might find another hand - type that suits your style better.

Classic Precision uses the 3@D rebid to show that shape anyway.  

The sequence  2@C - 2@D - 3NT  shows a 6-card club suit with all 3 outside suits stopped.  Responder should be aware that in these circumstances, although Opener is likely to be maximum, the Club suit may not be first class.

Over  2@C - 2@D - 2NT - 3@D - 3x  and  2@C - 2@D - 3@C - 3@D - 3x    Opener must bear in mind that Responder is FIRMLY the Captain of the Hand.

Responder may not be remotely interested in playing in 3NT, but simply establishing where Opener's outside stops are.  After the response to the 3@D Relay, Responder will normally set the final contract (unless they use Beta).

At the moment, for Beta, think RKCB.  If Responder bids 4@C immediately over any Response to the 2@D Forcing Relay, then this is Gamma in Clubs.

If, however, Responder bids 4@C over the response to the 3@D further relay (over 3@C), then this is invitational only, since clearly Responder has a reasonable hand, but there is a fatal weakness (for 3NT) in one of the outside suits.

Over 2NT  i.e.    2@c - 2@d - 2NT - 3@D -   then  4@C is forcing.

Before you start using the Asking Bids, better to think of 2@C - 2@D - 2x/3x - 4@C are agreeing Clubs, inviting slam, and asking Opener to cue - bid.|

second Relay (of 3@D) then Opener's rebids are constrained:  

i.e. after    2@c - 2@d - 2Maj - 3@d    then 
^c@2
A Bid in the OTHER Major at the 3-level shows a 3-card holding with a Diamond Singleton.

A REBID of their 4-card Major shows 3-card Diamonds and a singleton in the OTHER Major.

3NT shows ANY 2425 or 4225 hand

4@C shows 4306 or 3406 shape (the one 4-6 hand that does NOT use the 3@C Opener)

4@D shows 4-card Diamonds and a VOID in the other Major

fp|t-title|at|Dealing with Overcalls of  2@c|fp||at|

|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  If Opps overcall 2@C, then a double is negative and effectively takes the place of the 2@D Forcing Enquiry. (As does Re-Double over a takeout double). 

Opener rebids normally (as they would over the 2@D Forcing Enquiry) if they can.  If Opener has a 4-card holding in Opps' suit, they will normally PASS.  A Double by Responder over   2@C - (2@H)  and  2@C - (2@S)  is negative, suggesting a 4-card holding in the other Major.

I already said   2@C - (2x) - X  is effectively negative but takes the place of the forcing enquiry Worth noting at this stage that 2@C - (X) - 2@D is NOT the forcing Relay, but now a fundamentally weak rescue with long Diamonds, a hand that cannot normally be shown.

Responder should bear in mind, however, that there is normally no need for them to bid ANYTHING over a takeout double by Opps, since it is uncommon for that kind of a double to be left in for penalties when Opener is known to have a good 5-card or longer suit.

That's especially true when Opener's LHO doubles for t/o and East with Clubs is of course sitting UNDER Opener.  So normally there is no need for Responder to panic over ANY interference.  

2NT by Responder is Lebensohl, forcing a rebid of 3@C, with "normal" continuations.

If Responder makes the replacement forcing enquiry bid, however (eg: 2@C - (X) - XX or 2@C - (2@H) - X), then 2NT by Opener is NOT Lebensohl, but simply the Forcing Enquiry response showing the 6-card suit with 2 outside stops.

2@C - (2@H) - 2NT   is Lebensohl, forcing a 3@C rebid from Opener.  This is a common sequence should Responder simply want to compete in Clubs without inviting anything further.  Otherwise, over interference, continuations are natural and for the most part non - forcing (but bear in mind that in a sequence such as -

2@C - (2@S) - ???   a 3@D or 3@H bid from Responder now is definitely FORCING and showing a decent hand, probably with a 6-card or longer suit, as per competitive Lebensohl, and will probably have a tolerance for Clubs, at least.|

While creating these bridge movies, I have gone through and added to, or amended, many of the alerts that were in the original text.

I have changed them from being ^*b REAL ^*n alerts, that you should give to real opponents, and have replaced them with ^*b STUDY ^*n alerts.   Study alerts are only useful to students of Oliver's Precision.  Of course in many cases no changes were needed.   For example    1@c     16+ Any dist except 16-23 4441

An easy mistake in reply to an Epsilon is when, say, you hold ^*b Q76 ^*n in the suit, and so give only ^*b Qxx ^*n in the alert.   THAT  IS  WRONG.  The agreement is ^*b 3rd round control ^*n and that is what should be told to the opps.   

The ^*b ethical ^*n problem with telling too much to your opps is that it disadvantages the other pairs who will play your opponents cards.|

^^East is not quite good enough to move over 2@H  (needs to be max with better @H support).|

at|^^^^Here, South has a good fit for  @S  and is upper-range so invites also worth noting that South has the kind of @C holding which fits none too badly with a singleton opposite.
^^If South had KJ9xxx in @C, they might be slower to move over 2@S,  hopefully you get the point.|

^^ ^d If East was 13+ they'd likely rebid 3NT rather than 2NT, so 2NT is effectively limited to 12.|

at|2@C - 4@C   is a pre-emptive and fundamentally weak raise with really good trump support and shape, but not much in the way of HCP.|
at|^^^^Even if North doubles for t/o, East will have no problem bidding 5@C and NS might well leave them there.
^^OK, last hand coming up, then I must go.|
