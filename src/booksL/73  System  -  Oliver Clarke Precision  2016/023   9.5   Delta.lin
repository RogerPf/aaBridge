cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Hi Everyone and welcome to today's Precision Club session, in which the plan is that we'll be continuing our look at Precision Asking Bids.

Today we will be looking at Delta, which is the "strongest" Asking Bid.

You can find these on: ^*h http://bbo.pigpen.org.uk/index.php ^*n  You will DEFINITELY want to have these on screen in the background for reference during this session .

The Notes on Delta are at ^*h http://bbo.pigpen.org.uk/Delta.php ^*n  If you are new to Asking Bids then there's no way you're going to absorb everything we cover tonight, so please do visit the site and read through the Asking Bid section at your leisure.

To download the Precision system documents on the site see   ^*h http://bbo.pigpen.org.uk/Documents.php^*n

They are fairly large (around 500k) but cover this stuff in more detail.|

fp|t-title|at|Recap  of  Asking  Bids  covered  so  far|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  A quick recap.


So far we've looked at 4 Asking Bids: 


^*bBeta:^*n ^d@2This is our general Control Asking Bid, our equivalent to Blackwood but it asks about Controls (Ace = 2, King = 1) and is normally available in almost ANY sequence in one form or another Next up was 
^b@2

^*bAlpha^*n: ^d@2This is Declarer's Primary Trump Asking Bid.        
This is not as common as you might think but it's always the FIRST Asking Bid in a sequence if it's used at all (either a simple new suit over a positive response to 1@C or a jump-shift over a 1@D, 1NT or 2@C Opening).
^b@2

^*bGamma:^*n  @2This is an Asking Bid used to find out about the strength and length of partner's 5+-card suit.
Normally this is done by simply bidding partner's suit if we've not yet agreed another suit as trumps in an Asking Bid sequence, but also occurs in some 1@H and 1@S sequences too.

^b@2
^*bEpsilon:^*n  @2which is a suit-specific Control Asking Bid used only AFTER we have agreed trumps.
Epsilon looks at honour cards AND shortages and so is finding out the DEGREE of control held in a side-suit (which is why we have to know what trumps are FIRST).|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|The  Delta  Ask|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Ok, let's move onto Delta,

You may recall back at the start of the 1@C section of this series that I said that after a NEGATIVE response to 1@C (ie: any time Responder shows 0-7 HCP), bidding proceeds naturally and we are NOT in a game-forcing situation and NOT using Asking Bids.

@DDelta@D occurs in one situation only, a jump-shift immediately over the 1@D NEGATIVE response to a 1@C Opening (or another sequence whereby Responder shows 0-7 HCP).

This jump-shift shows an EXTREMELY strong hand (ostensibly 24+ hcp, but might be less with great playing strength) and asks for responder's exact holding in the suit bid.

So here  2@S  a jump-shift over the  1@d  Negative response, is Delta and launches us into an Asking Bid sequence, despite the 1@d negative.  

24+ needs some explanation: Hands that use Delta will normally fall into one of the
following hand-types:

^c(1)  @224+ hands with 4441 distribution

^c(2)  @2Unbalanced hands in the 24+ range

^c(3)  @2Very unbalanced hands (eg: distributional 2-suiters) with game-going playing strength
despite being < 24 points

^c(4)  @2Any hand where Opener has game in their own hand regardless of partner's holdings 
and is NOT balanced.
^b@2
So hands that use Delta are NEVER going to be balanced.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  As explained, Delta occurs only as a jump-shift immediately over any Negative response to a 1@C Opener.

It is the only way Opener can FORCE an Asking Bid sequence after a 1@D negative.

It must be reserved for very very strong hands where game is pretty much certain opposite an unsuitable yarborough.

Remember, Responder has promised NOTHING and you're not guaranteed any kind of fit so don't devalue the requirements for Delta.

Essentially the use of Delta makes the sequence game-forcing when Responder might have absolutely no points and no fit for you.

Needless to say, it's a fairly rare Asking Bid.

So some hands that ARE 24+ may not qualify for Delta.

As I've said before, it's easier to bid strongly later on in a natural, non-forcing sequence than it is to undo the game-forcing nature of Delta. 



Any questions on the requirements for Delta ?|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Delta  Response  Table|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  The steps in response to Delta are as follows:
^d@2
^f Remember   ^*bH^*n    =    A, K or Q      (never J or 10)
^d@2
  1    step    ^g -   ^*b     or  ^*n  x
  2    steps   ^g H  ^*b     or  ^*n xx
  3    steps   ^g Hx ^*b    or  ^*n xxx
        |cp|d-feint|at|@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-|cp||at|
  4    steps   ^g HH ^*b     or  ^*n Hxx                   (4 steps or more agrees the suit as trumps)
  5    steps   ^g xxxx
  6    steps   ^g HHx ^*b   or  ^*n Hxxx
  7    steps   ^g HHxx
  8    steps   ^g xxxxx ^*b      or   ^*n xxxxxx
  9    steps   ^g Hxxxx ^*b     or   ^*n Hxxxxx
10    steps   ^g HHxxx ^*b    or   ^*n HHxxxx
^b@2
As you can see from the scheme of responses outlined above, the other reason that Delta must be reserved for very strong hands is because the responses can be hideously expensive if partner has good support for the suit.

A double-raise of the suit  so     1@C  -  1@D  -  2@H  -  4@H    is not impossible.   

Here Hearts are agreed and we are in an established Asking Bid sequence, despite the 1@D negative response.  

A 4-step response to Delta agrees the suit.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Delta  Negative and Positive Continuations|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   If a Delta ask gets a negative (1 - 3 step) response, then an immediate new suit by Opener is Iota, which we'll come to next week in detail, but for now Iota uses similar responses to Delta except that the 1 and 2-step responses are COMBINED.

So (for Iota) a 1-step response shows  "Less than Hx or xxx"  and a 2-step response shows Hx or xxx.   For eaxmple

^c1@C  -  1@D  -  2@S(Delta)  -  3@S shows   xxxx (Jxxx at best)   in Spades.  

^c1@C  -  1@D  -  2@H(Delta)  -  2NT @2shows a singleton honour or a small doubleton and if Opener now 
bids 3@C, 3@D, or 3@S, then these would be Iota.
^b@2
Any comments or questions? 


So the continuations over a positive response to Delta are exactly akin to those over Gamma or to a positive response to Alpha.

Similarly, the continuations over a NEGATIVE response to Delta are identical to those over a negative response to Alpha (not quite identical in the case of a repeat in the same suit, mind).

It's important to bear in mind that the "rules" for suit agreement for Delta pre-suppose that you're using it in a suit where you have at least a 5-card holding yourself.

Especially with a 24+ 4441-shape hand, this can cause problems, so sometimes it might be worthwhile devaluing a 24-count 4441 to a 2@D Opening.

24+ 4441 hands can cause problems.          Fortunately they are fairly rare :)|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Repeat Delta|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Unless the response to Delta is 5 or 7 steps (showing xxxx or KQxx respectively) then an immediate REPEAT Ask in the Delta suit by Opener BELOW GAME LEVEL is asking for clarification of responder's exact holding.

Responder always shows the SHORTER of the 2 alternatives as 1 step, and the LONGER as 2 steps.


Regardless of what Responder shows, a repeat Delta in the same suit ALWAYS sets the suit as trumps.

If a Repeat Delta BELOW game level is used after a 5 or 7-step response (ie: where there are no alternatives), then this question relates SOLELY to whether or not Responder has the Jack (1 step denies, 2 steps promises).


Time for an example hand.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Even though a repeat of the Delta suit at GAME LEVEL is not strictly forcing, responder should bear in mind that Opener is VERY strong and continue with a near positive (eg: 5-7 points) if possible (by answering as if it WAS a repeat Delta.

If the initial response to Delta agreed the suit (4 steps or more) then a rebid of the suit at game level is obviously "to play".

Any JUMP to GAME in the Delta suit is obviously "to play" and should never be interpreted as a Repeat Delta.

That wouldn't, of course, stop Responder from cue-bidding an undisclosed void if they had a near maximum.

Not sure I'd bother cue-bidding a singleton, though.   Thus 

^c 1@C  -  1@D  -  2@S(Delta)  -  3@C(Q or xx)     -  3@S(Repeat)  -  4@C   shows xx in Spades 

^c 1@C  -  1@D  -  2@H(Delta)  -  3@C(Qx or xxx)  -  3@H(Repeat)  -  3@S   shows a doubleton honour.

A repeat Delta in the same suit ALWAYS sets that suit as trumps.      However 

^c 1@C  -  1@D  -  3@C(Delta)  -  3@S(Hx/xxx)   -  5@C    is always "to play".        Similarly, 

^c 1@C  -  1@D  -  2@H        -      3@D(HH/Hxx)  -  5@H    is simply invitational to 6@H, no more.

Don't forget that after a 4-step or greater response to Delta, or after ANY response to a repeat Delta in the same suit, the suit is agreed as trumps, so a Relay in the next suit up will be the Relay Beta Ask.

We saw examples of that in both of the sequences shown here.|

I have changed them from being ^*b REAL ^*n alerts, that you should give to real opponents, and have replaced them with ^*b STUDY ^*n alerts.   Study alerts are only useful to students of Oliver's Precision.  Of course in many cases no changes were needed.   For example    1@c     16+ Any dist except 16-23 4441

It is particularly important that we make the alerts for  ^*b Asking bids and their responses^*n,  as clear as possible

	    ^c ^*b Study Alert ^*n           ^i ^*b Real Alert ^*n                ^o ^*b It would be great if you could add ^*n
     ^b      @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@- ^h       @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-   ^n       @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-
		^c Beta    Relay Beta ...          ^i Gen Ctrl Ask                    ^o A = 2,  K = 1 
		^c Alpha                           ^i Asking  in                      ^o Trump ...
		^c Gamma                           ^i Asking  in partners suit        ^o Trump ...
		^c Epsilon                         ^i Specific Ctrl Ask               ^o in ... 
		^c Hxx                             ^i Hxx                             ^o in ... 
		^c none  or  1st & 2nd             ^i none  or  1st & 2nd             ^o [xxx, AKx(x)]
		^c 3rd rd ctrl                     ^i 3rd rd ctrl                     ^o [xx, Qxx(x), Qx]
		
An easy mistake in reply to an Epsilon is when, say, you hold ^*b Q76 ^*n in the suit, and so give only ^*b Qxx ^*n in the alert.   THAT  IS  WRONG.  The agreement is ^*b 3rd round control ^*n and that is what should be told to the opps.   

The ^*b ethical ^*n problem with telling too much to your opps is that it disadvantages the other pairs who will play your opponents cards.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  A bit earlier, Eszter was clearly thinking about asking in @H rather than Clubs.

It's a tough choice: 3@C is cheaper than 3@H, but it's less likely that a negative response will allow a 3@H repeat, as compared to fitting in a 4@C repeat over a negative response to 3@H.

As there is only a 1 step between 3@C and 3@H, it is unlikely that a negative response to 3@C will allow 3@H.|
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  On the other hand, given the 2NT response to 2@S, it's very unlikely that West will have a SECOND singleton, void or doubleton.

So you might we well hope for the best and try 3@C.     See my point, everyone?

pg| ***** 128 ***** |


at|BECAUSE an opening  @D  ruff is so MUCH more likely in  6@H than a @H ruff is in 6@D, consider the lead of a singleton @d to the Ace,  this makes 6@D a considerably safer contract than 6@H. 

I would therefore prefer to see  3@D  Iota over  2@S  rather than a  3@H  Repeat Delta.

West can always jump-shift back into @H later on.|

cp|red|at|^*bOliver:^*n|cp||at|  Delta is a comparatively rare bird.   

As we'll see next week its siblings Theta and Iota are MUCH more common. 

We'll leave it there for this week. 


Thanks for coming and hope you've found the session useful.
