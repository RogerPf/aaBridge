cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Hi Everyone and welcome to today's Precision Club session, in which we'll be starting to have a look at what to do when opponents interfere during our Asking Bid Sequence.

We've touched on a few aspects of this over the weeks when we've been covering the Asking Bids, but now it's time to learn systematically how we deal with interference.

This is all too frequent an occurrence and you have to be prepared for it.

If you really get your act together with partner you can frequently turn ill-advised interference to your advantage.

In general, though, the aim is simply to conserve and reclaim as much bidding space as possible.

This is not an easy topic even if you are already reasonably comfortable with the Asking Bids that we've covered over the last couple of months, because most of the concepts will be new, so be prepared for a rough ride.

Some of the concepts that we'll be covering today, though, can be very useful, whatever system you play.

If you have not already done so, please have a look at the notes I have prepared on Precision Club bidding.

You can find these on: ^*h http://bbo.pigpen.org.uk ^*n The notes on Interference during Asking Bid sequences can be found at ^*h http://bbo.pigpen.org.uk/AskingInterference.php ^*n. 

If you are new to Asking Bids then there's no way you're going to absorb everything we cover tonight, so please do visit the site and read through the Asking Bid section at your leisure.

Ok, let's get started|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Introduction|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   If you start playing Precision regularly, you will find that opponents (especially good ones) tend to interfere a fair amount, especially during  1@C  sequences.

Many Precision pairs are not prepared for this and consequently allow their auction to be disrupted to a considerable extent or even have to completely "abandon" their sequences.

It is my intention that you should ^*b NOT ^*N fall into this category.   Clearly if the bidding starts something like 1@C - (5@S), there isn't going to be a whole lot of space for you to do much.

But even so, the methods I'm going to show you over the next few weeks will at least allow you a degree of control and the option of Asking further.|

fp|t-title|at|Divided  into  Sections|fp||at|^^^^|

^^
If you think that the order of those sections is a bit cock-eyed, you're right, but it's for a very good reason, which will become obvious as we progress.

We will be covering   |cp|h-highlight|at|^*bSection A^*n|cp||at| & |cp|h-highlight|at|^*bB |cp||at|^*n  this week,   |cp|h-highlight|at|^*bC^*n|cp||at|  next week  and   |cp|h-highlight|at|^*bD |cp||at|^*n the week after.

Each situation is completely different and the tactics employed in each situation are likewise completely different.

The first of these has already been partly covered when looking at the  1@C  Sequences:|

fp|t-title|cp|h-highlight|at|^*b[A.]^*n|cp||at|     Intervention immediately over a  1@C  Opening|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  When the opponents interfere immediately over the  1@C Opening, then
 
^c@2
^*bPass^*n           ^e   shows    ^*b 0 - 4^*n   hcp
^*bX^*n or ^*bXX^*n  ^e   shows    ^*b 5 - 7^*n   hcp

^b^*bany other bid^*n^e   shows    ^*b Positive response     8+^*n   hcp
^^^^
^bIf the interference is at the level of    ^*b2@H  or above^*n   (but ^*bYOU^*n decide where to draw the line), then 

^*bPass^*n           ^e   shows    ^*b0 - 7^*n   hcp
^*bX^*n              ^e   is a  ^*bPositive Double^*n  showing  ^*b8+^*n  but with no good bid at the moment.

^bSo
1@C  -  (pass)  -  1@D     ^h   always  shows   ^*b0 - 7^*n      (no interference)
1@C  -   (??)    -  Pass   ^h   always  shows   ^*B0 - 4^*n
1@C  -   (??)    -  X / XX   ^h   always  shows   ^*b5 - 7^*n 
^b@2
But remember the change when the interference is at or above the 2@H level where your  ^*bDouble^*n  becomes a positive response.   Thus:
^c@2
1@C  -  (2@S)   -  Pass        ^hshows any  0-7

1@C  -  (2@S)   -  X           ^h@2shows 8+ with nothing particular to show at this stage.   You may not have a 5+ card suit to show and may not have a good enough holding in their suit to bid No Trumps.|

fp|t-title|cp|h-highlight|at|^*b[A.]^*n|cp||at|     Intervention immediately over a  1@C  Opening|fp||at|     continued^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  One upshot of this is that the sequence 
^c@2
1@C  -  (X)  -  1@D       is a  POSITIVE (8+)  response in Diamonds.
^b@2
Here  1NT  is now a low-level Beta, exactly as it would be without intervention as in  1@c  -  1@h/@S   -   1NT

Similarly, as a double over pre-emptive interference shows 8+, you now treat 
^c@2
1@C  -  (2@S)  -  X       as a  POSITIVE (8+)  response, so  new suit bids are still Alpha.
^b@2
Please note, however, that there is  ^*bno scope^*n  for a low-level Beta Ask over a  ^*bpositive double^*n.

Don't forget that if you have a  POSITIVE 4441  hand, then all the arrangements over interference have now changed, depending on whether or not your potential response has been disturbed.  So:
^c@2
1@C  -  (1@H)  -  2@H      is  STILL  4144  with 8-11 points.

^bBut if the bidding goes 

1@C  -  (2NT = both ^*bMinor^*ns)   -   ???        now:
^b@2
a  ^*bDouble^*n  will be any  8-11  hand (Positive Double)  
^cOR  possibly a  12+  4441 hand  with a Major suit shortage.
^cWith the 4441 hand and a minor singleton you can ^*b cue bid the Minor^*n  to show the shortage there.


Any questions on what we do when there's interference immediately over the  1@C Opening?      ok|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Intervention immediately over an ASKING BID.

We're now going to introduce you to a couple of acronyms, (which you may already know): 

DOPI & ROPI.   DOPI stands for   Double Zero Pass One    and   ROPI  stands for   Redouble Zero Pass One.

What we are using here isn't quite  DOPI  &  ROPI,  but very close (more like  D1P2  &  R1P2).

The point is that we can now use ^*b Double ^*n and/or ^*b Pass ^*n as responses to the Asking Bid.  So:

^c^*bDouble^*n / ^*bRedouble^*n ^h shows the   1 step   response
^c^*bPass^*n                    ^h shows the   2 step   response   (hence D1P2 and R1P2) 
^c^*nthe next bid up^*n           ^h shows the   3 step   response,  etc

DOPI and ROPI are not a concept confined to Precision and many people who use Blackwood also use DOPI & ROPI (or their cousins DOPE and ROPE [odd/even])

DOPI and ROPI are very useful with Asking Bids, as you can save up to ^*b 2 steps ^*n in your response and reclaim some space.  For example:
^c@2
1@c  -  1@H  -  1NT(Beta)  -  (2@D)       now 
^d@2
Double ^fshows ^h0-2  ^ictrls,
Pass ^fshows   ^h3    ^ictrls 
2@H ^fshows    ^h4    ^ictrls, etc, and you've reclaimed  ALL  of the space lost due to the intervention.
^b@2|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |

fp|t-title|cp|h-highlight|at|^*b[B.1]^*n|cp||at|   Intervention immediately over an  ASKING BID |fp||at|     continued^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  To recap,  
^c@2
^*bDouble^*n  or  ^*bRedouble^*n ^h show    the  1 step  response to the Asking Bid
^*bPass^*n                        ^h shows  the  2 step  response
^*bThe next bid up^*n             ^h shows  the  3 step  response, etc
@b^b@2
This is especially effective when the opponents  DOUBLE  the Asking Bid, because you actually GAIN space by this method.

Please bear in mind that PASS is  ^*bnot always an option^*n, (for example when partner has ALREADY passed over some interference which, as we'll see next week, can itself be an Asking Bid),

but  ^*bDouble^*n  or  ^*bRedouble^*n  will still be available in those circumstances to count as the 1 step response, and now 1 actual step would become the 2-step response  etc.

For example...
^c@2
1@C            -  (pass)    -    1@H    -    (pass)
1@S(Alpha)   -   (X)      -    ??? 

^bNow the alpha responses keep their normal steps but have different bids to represent them:

Re-Double ^f1 step   ^h shows ^j No @S support   and   0-3  controls  
Pass ^f2 steps  ^h shows ^j No @S support   and    4+  controls 
1NT  ^f3 steps  ^h shows ^j       @S support   and   0-3  controls    etc etc

^bso we've GAINED some space.
^b@2|

fp|t-title|cp|h-highlight|at|^*b[B.1]^*n|cp||at|   Intervention immediately over an  ASKING BID |fp||at|     continued^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Another Example
^c@2
 1@C  -  1@H  -  2@D(Alpha)  -  (2@S)  -  ??? 
^b@2
^bOnce again the alpha responses keep their normal steps but have different bids to represent them:
^c@2
X    ^e 1 step ^h shows ^j       No @D Support   and   0-3   controls   
Pass ^e 2 steps^h shows ^j       No @D Support   and   4+    controls      
2NT  ^e 3 steps^h shows ^j             @D Support   and   0-3   controls      
3@C  ^e 4 steps^h shows ^j             @D Support   and   4+    controls
3@D  ^e 5 steps^h shows ^j GOOD @D Support   and   4      controls  
3@H  ^e 6 steps^h shows ^j GOOD @D Support   and   5      controls    etc
^b@2
So there we recovered ALL of the space lost due to the interference.
Sometimes we have still lost SOME space, but we're able to limit the damage to our seuqence, as in
^c@2
1@C             ^g   -    (pass)     -     1@H    -    (1@S) 
Pass(Gamma in @H)    -    (pass)     -     ??? 
^b@2
Here the Gamma responses keep their normal steps but have different bids to represent them:
^c@2
X    ^e 1 step ^h shows ^j     no Top Honour in @H 
1NT  ^e 2 steps ^h shows ^j     a 5-card suit with 1 Top Honour in @H, etc etc.
^b@2
So here, because partner's Pass was Asking, a Pass wasn't an option for us, (it would pass out the aution) so we can only reclaim 1 step with a double.

Bear in mind that we've actually gained a whole round of bidding because of partner being able to Pass to ask about our Hearts. so we're already ahead of the game.                                                 Let's look at an example hand|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at| Any Questions ?

^*bkritter2:^*n  Why is it called   Relay Beta   rather than just   Beta?
 
  
|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at| It is just a name we gave it way back in the mists of time and it's stuck to differentiate it from any other time that beta is used.

A Relay in the next suit up (not counting the agreed trump suit) is ALWAYS available as Beta when we've just agreed trumps by means of an Asking Bid sequence.   Hence the name.

^^^^^c|fp|t-title|at|^*bMM:^*n            Up a bit Beta     v     Relay Beta |fp||at|                a difference in name only ^^^^|
at|^d@2^w@3
^*bMM:^*n   I find it clearer to think of it as  ^*bUp a bit Beta^*n  rather than  'Relay Beta'.    IMO the rules for where it falls are more complicated than implied by calling it a 'relay bid'.

For example Oliver is incorrect above where he says  "... Relay in the next suit up ...",  sometimes  ^*bUp a bit Beta^*n  will be in  No Trumps  and sometimes  No Trumps  will be skipped.  

( If the next  ^*bbid^*n  up is 3 No Trumps and if the agreed trump suit is a Major then 3 No Trumps is  ^*bUp a Bit Beta^*n.  If the agreed suit is a minor then  3 No Trumps  is a valid stopping point. )

The rules for  ^*bUp a bit Beta^*n  (Relay Beta) are scattered through out these chapters.  The Chapter on  Eta  is particularly pertinent.|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Pre-emptive Intervention immediately over an ASKING BID.

If the interference is of such a nature that it jumps AT LEAST 1-round of bidding to a level at or above 3NT, then we need to do something slightly more extreme to conserve space.

What follows are simply suggestions.

You can come up with different ranges if you like: 

Before I outline the different actions with different Asking Bids, let me mention something: 

There has been some discussion behind the scenes about REDUCING the level at which this (and some other aspects of our defence to pre-emptive interference) kicks in.

Nothing has been decided as yet, but the 3NT level  ^*bmight^*n  change at some point in the future.

Now, hopefully you will see why in ALL situations, a Double by Responder is the WEAKEST option, as it allows Opener to pass the double for penalties if they deem it sensible.

Let me show you a hand.|

ht|d|at|^^|
cp||at|^*bMM:^*n|cp||at|  We all know we have to alert when playing  'proper'  bridge.

The laws of the game say that what we have to put in the alert is  ^*b our agreement with partner ^*n about that bid.

While creating these bridge movies, I have gone through and added to, or amended, many of the alerts that were in the original text.

I have changed them from being ^*b REAL ^*n alerts, that you should give to real opponents, and have replaced them with ^*b STUDY ^*n alerts.   Study alerts are only useful to students of Oliver's Precision.  Of course in many cases no changes were needed.   For example    1@c     16+ Any dist except 16-23 4441

It is particularly important that we make the alerts for  ^*b Asking bids and their responses^*n,  as clear as possible

	    ^c ^*b Study Alert ^*n           ^i ^*b Real Alert ^*n                ^o ^*b It would be great if you could add ^*n
     ^b      @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@- ^h       @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-   ^n       @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-
		^c Beta    Relay Beta ...          ^i Gen Ctrl Ask                    ^o A = 2,  K = 1 
		^c Alpha                           ^i Asking  in                      ^o Trump ...
		^c Gamma                           ^i Asking  in partners suit        ^o Trump ...
		^c Epsilon                         ^i Specific Ctrl Ask               ^o in ... 
		^c Hxx                             ^i Hxx                             ^o in ... 
		^c none  or  1st & 2nd             ^i none  or  1st & 2nd             ^o [xxx, AKx(x)]
		^c 3rd rd ctrl                     ^i 3rd rd ctrl                     ^o [xx, Qxx(x), Qx]
		
An easy mistake in reply to an Epsilon is when, say, you hold ^*b Q76 ^*n in the suit, and so give only ^*b Qxx ^*n in the alert.   THAT  IS  WRONG.  The agreement is ^*b 3rd round control ^*n and that is what should be told to the opps.   

The ^*b ethical ^*n problem with telling too much to your opps is that it disadvantages the other pairs who will play your opponents cards.|

The point is that you will have 4 discards on the long Diamonds, and it's impossible for West to have 7-card Clubs  (5-card @H and @DAx so it doesn't matter WHAT  West's  Club holding is)  if you don't need to ask, don't Ask.

tu|y|
ht|f|at|^*bMM:^*n  Back in  deal Practice 2   I was challenged by Oliver to bring in the Grand Slam.  

I did not manage it     BUT YOU CAN     perhaps with a little prompting from me.    :)

On each of the following pages I will present the deal with same opening lead  @C7

But each time with a bit more of a hint.     But first I need to show you how to get ^*b aaBridge ^*n to PLAY the cards.


|fp|t-title|at|^- IMPORTANT   you need to read the next two pages ^-|fp||at|

When the deal is showing,  in the bottom right hand corner is the    { ^*bEnter  the Deal^*n }    button.  You need to click it.

then on the left, on the green baize, are three blue buttons:  
^c@2
{    ^*bEdit^*n    }

{    ^*bPlay^*n   }

 ^*bReview^*n               (this  'Review'  button  will start  'clicked'  and so shows differently.)
^b@2
 
|cp|red|at|^*bYou need to click^*n|cp||at|    {    ^*bPlay^*n   }   and  then click on the |cp|red|at|^*b card ^*n|cp||at| you want to play from dummy.


|fp|t-title|at|OR|fp||at|  click   {    ^*bEdit^*n   }   then  you will  ^*bget to see all four hand^*n  and will need to pick EVERY card,     Use  {  ^*bPlay^*n  }  :)|
pg| ***** 129 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|
mn| No Cheating    :) |
tu|y|
ht|f|at|^*bMM:^*n  I know it would not really be cheating.   :)

But if you have the same idea that   Uof FL Jen   had in the class then I want to ignore that possibility as being outside the scope of this problem.

( Please click forward and look at the hand and bidding and then click or better still  ^*bmouse wheel^*n back here. )


The thought goes like this  -  West has bid  @h's  and so must have at least five.  That means that East has at most one.   If West as both the Jack and the 10  then we can double finesse in hearts for the  13th trick.

In terms of this problem this is  "cheating" :)   but if you really want to do it  -  then aaBridge as a feature to defeat you

In the column exposed by the  right-hand slider  select the ^*b AutoPlay ^*n tab 
^l and check the box marked   ^*bMake your finesse is mostly fail^*n.

Now when you try and  'cheat'  and take the finesse it will always fail.  :)    Best to ^*b un-check that box^*n  when done.


Jen's  idea of understanding the heart situation is a good one  -  please take that as your first hint.

If you have used any other  ^*baaBridge^*n  features  then  please in  right-hand panel  select the ^*b Seat Choice ^*n tab, and click the  ^*bApply Defaults^*n  button.   You do not want to start by seeing all the cards do you.  :) 

   |cp|r|at|I know sometimes  ^*baaBridge^*n  does not put up the best defense,    You always can use { Edit } and play both sides.|cp||at|

|cp|h-highlight|at|After this deal is finished there is a final page on how you can get  ^*baaBridge^*n  to help you practice squeeze play.|

mn|Using  aaBridge  to  Practice Squeezes|
tu|n|
ht|f|at|^*bMM:^*n  On the aaBridge  ^*bWelcome^*n  page is a button marked   ^*bPlay Bridge and show Deal Choices^*n   click that.

    ( You can have two copies of  ^*baaBridge^*n  open at once  -  one reading this, the other following along. )
	
In the right hand column the  ^*bNew Deals^*n  tab will now be showing.  

Click on the final radio button    -       33+  7NT  HARDEST

Next click the   { ^*bNew Board^*n }   button  center left.  

You will often have only 12 top tricks.   Squeeze possibilities will frequently provide the 13th. 

The  small slam  options,  which can generate trump contracts,  can also be used in this way.

|cp|r|at|^*baaBridge^*n  has a couple of built in tutorials on squeezes.   See : |cp||at|   

^d Menu bar           ^g ^*b Books ^*n    >    Watsons  -  Play of the Hand             >    Part 2 - 7

	                  ^g ^*b BooksL ^*n  >    Lessons  -  Declarer Play Lessons    >    squeezes   (bottom left column)


One  on-line  starting point is   ^*h http://squeeze-analysis.blogspot.co.uk/2005/06/introduction.html ^*n

Back in the 80's Terence Reese produced a series of books on Squeeze Play.  Many can be found  2nd hand  you really want the  ^*bSimple Squeeze^*n  book  before any of the others.

Your motto really needs to be  ^*bLearn the simple squeezes^*n  first.   |
