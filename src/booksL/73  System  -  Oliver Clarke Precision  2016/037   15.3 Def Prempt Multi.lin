cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Hi Everyone and welcome to today's session, in which we're going to continue looking at various artificial defences.

Specifically, we're going to look at Defences to Pre-empts, Defences to Transfer Pre-empts, Defences to 2-suited Overcalls, and Defences to the Multi 2@d.

Some of these situations may be comparatively rare for you but it's worth being prepared nonetheless.

Needless to say, these defences can apply and be used whatever system you yourselves are playing.

Similarly, these defences do not come as a "job lot", and I make no claims that these are definitely "the best" available in a given situation. 

You are free to cherry-pick any that you feel have worth to you and your partner.

If you have not already done so, please have a look at the notes I have prepared on Precision Club bidding.

You can find these on:   ^*h http:bbo.pigpen.org.uk ^*n   

You might want to have these on screen in the background for reference during the session.

The notes on these defences can be found at ^*h http://bbo.pigpen.org.uk/Defences.php ^*n|

lg|c|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   The first Defence we're going to look at is a defence to Pre-empts.

I would guess that most of you just double for take-out, anything else is natural and that's about it.

Indeed that's how *I* play most of the time.

However just occasionally, you might find yourself in a situation where Opps are vulnerable and you are not. 

They pre-empt, and you're sat with a trump stack and a biggish hand and would REALLY like to be able to double for penalties.

If that's the case then FILM-X is the convention for you!!! 


FILM-X is a combination of two different defences to Pre-empts: "FIshbein", and "Lower Minor".

^c^*bFishbein^*n     ^g NEXT SUIT UP  over a pre-empt is for  Takeout.
|n^|5|at|
^c^*bLower-Minor^*n  ^g cheapest  MINOR  suit over the pre-empt is for  Takeout.


The combined scheme for FILM-X is as follows:|

^c ^*b2nd-in-hand^*n  ie: sat ^*n OVER ^*n the  pre-empt:

^d@.   Double is always  100%  for PENALTIES 
^d@.   Ne@2xt suit up is for takeout, BUT...
... If the Next suit up is a ^*b Major ^*n THEN  you promise at least a ^*b 4-card ^*n holding in the suit,
Otherwise ...
^d@.   Lower Minor is for takeout.

^c ^*b4th-in-hand^*n  ie: sat UNDER the pre-empt  FILM-X does ^*b NOT ^*n apply, so 
^d@.   3NT/4NT are "to play"
^d@.   Double (Sat UNDER the pre-empter) is always 100% for TAKEOUT
^d@.   Overcalls are just overcalls

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Note that  FILM-X   only  applies in 2nd seat,  ie: over the pre-empt 
|lg|j|n^|4|at|
If Opps pre-empt with  3@c  then 
^c 3@d   is ALWAYS for takeout
^c  ^*bX^*n     double is for penalties
^c          anything else a natural overcall with 5+ cards 

If Opps pre-empt with  3@d  however, 
^c 3@h   is for takeout, but promises at least 4-card Hearts, 
^c 3@s   a natural overcall with 5+ and 
^c 4@c   is ALSO for takeout but DENYING 4-card Hearts

Similarly over a pre-empt of 3@h
^c 3@s   is for takeout but promises 4-card or longer Spades, 
^d ... otherwise ...
^c 4@c   is ALSO for takeout.

Hopefully you've got the idea by now.
|n^|9|at|
So FILM-X gives up on some NATURAL overcalls by 2nd-in-hand in order to give you a penalty double and a more flexible, informative take-out scheme.|

lg|c|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   The reason I don't automatically play FILM-X is that Opps rarely pre-empt at red vs green and that's normally the only time I'd really miss having a Penalty double.

At white vs red, however, it's worth considering using FILM-X, even if the opportunities will be few and far between.

In other circumstances I find it's difficult to get rich defending when they've pre-empted and normally you have something better on your way (eg: 3NT)

You can play FILM-X over 4-level pre-empts too: One modification there you might consider is that over 4@s, 
or over 4@h when you don't have 4-card Spades, play 4NT for takeout rather than 5@c

Any questions or comments about FILM-X or generally about defending against pre-empts?
|n#|5|at|
^*baflac: ^*n When you say red vs green ? 

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Yes: I mean it's worth considering using FILM-X in situations where THEY are vulnerable (red) and YOU are not vulnerable (green).

That's the most likely time that you'll get a decent penalty rather than playing in a game yourselves.
|n#|5|at|
^*bP0STM0RTEM: ^*n Will playing this affect decisions in the balancing seat when the direct seat passes ?

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   No. FILM-X doesn't apply in 4th seat over the pre-empt, because you are sat UNDER the pre-empter and as such it's much LESS likely that you're in the right place to penalise them.|

fp|t-title|at|Defending  against  Pre-empts    -    FILM-X|fp||at|      continued^^^^|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   But in practice, I find that most people rarely pre-empt in circumstances like that anyway (ie: at red vs green).

^^^*bP0STM0RTEM: ^*n   So a hand most overcallers would make with a 5+ card next suit beyond the preempt would be forced to pass in 2nd ? 

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Well, I as I said, you give up some natural overcalls to give partner a little more information about the takeout

^c (3@d)   -   3@h     doesn't GUARANTEE 5 card @h, but it does promise AT LEAST a 4-card @h suit.

^c (3@d)   -   4@c     doe@B@2sn't  PROMISE  a 4+ card Club suit,
|n^|9|at|
^*bBUT ^*n @b@2is does DENY having 4-card @h or 5-card @s and it's for takeout, 
so the likelyhood of your having a 4+ card @c suit is very strong 
so you're not really giving up much.

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   So if you're 4th-in-hand over the pre-empt, better to double when you have a hand for a takeout and so give-up having a Penalty double available.
FILM-X only applies in 2nd seat over the pre-empt and I think you'd only want to use it at FAVOURABLE vulnerability unlikely though it is that most people will pre-empt at UNFAVOURABLE vulnerability.
Any more questions ?|

lg|c|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Next up is a defence to Transfer Pre-empts.

This is a convention I created and licensed in the UK back in the 1980's when 3-level transfer pre-empts were quite popular.

4-level ones have always been popular and remain so (ie: Texas and South-African texas).

Although they are not quite as "in vogue" as they used to be you will still occasionally come up against transfer pre-empts at the 3-level.

As with the Dixon defence to Multi 2@d (which we'll be coming to) the possible actions are different for 2nd-in-hand (who is guaranteed another chance to bid) and 4th-in-hand (who is NOT guaranteed a second bite at the cherry).

Terminology for this section: 

^c@.   ^*b Transfer ^*n ^f Suit  is the suit Opps have actually   BID 
|n^|9|at|
^c@.   ^*b Pre-empt ^*n ^f Suit  is the suit they've actually     SHOWN

for example

If  3@c  shows a  Diamond  Pre-empt  then:
|n^|9|at|  
^c the ^*b Transfer ^*n Suit is  @c's   and   @d's  is  the ^*b Pre-empt ^*n Suit|

lg|c|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  As another example
|lg|h|at|
If your RHO bids 3@c showing a Diamond Pre-empt, then
|n^|9|at|
^*b  2nd-in-Hand ^*n 
^c Double   is a 3-suited takeout of Diamonds (@d)
^c Pass then Double   is a ^*b penalty ^*n double of Diamonds
^c 3@d shows ^*b both Majors^*n, and a bid of ^*b either Major ^*n shows that suit and Clubs (@c)
^c Pass and then a bid of any of the three other suits shows a  single-suited  hand
|n^|9|at|
^*b  4th-in-Hand ^*n is very different: in that 
^c Double  is strictly a takeout of the Pre-empt suit
^c everything else is natural.
|lg|c|n^|5|at|
4th-in-hand can't really use the full Clarke defence because 
^c (a)   they're sat UNDER the Pre-empter, so unlikely to want a penalty double (pass then double) and 
^c (b)   they're NOT guaranteed 2 chances to bid, because Opener will normally pass the transfer.
|n^|5|at|
Having said that, you could, I suppose, take everything ELSE from the Clarke defence except pass then double being for penalties, but I always found it best to keep things simple for 4th-in hand when partner had already passed over the transfer pre-empt.
|n^|5|at|
Worth noticing that if 2nd-in-hand passes initially, LHO completes the Transfer, it is ^*b not right ^*m to play FILM-X by 4th-in-hand since they are then sat UNDERNEATH the pre-empter.
|n^|5|at|
You'll most often encounter transfer pre-empts in the form of 4@c and 4@d Openings being "strong" Major suit pre-empts at the 4-level Not many people use transfer pre-empts at the 3-level these days.

Any questions or comments about defending against Transfer Pre-empts in general or about my defence to them in particular ?|

fp|t-title|at|Defending  against  the Multi 2@d|fp||at|      ^^^^|
lg|c|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Next up is how to defend against a Multi 2@d Opening

You may not play against many Multi 2@d if you concentrate on ACBL events, but the Multi remains very popular in the REST of the world (it's only unpopular in the USA and UK,  "thanks to"  the ACBL and EBU).

Consequently it is worth knowing how it works and how to defend against it.

Multi's come in a number of guises, the main common-denominator being that one of the options is always a weak 2 in either Major.

Sometimes that's ALL it shows but usually there is a "strong" option as well, sometimes strong balanced, but Precision Pairs often use it for a strong 4441 hand (The "complex" version of my system does, for example).

Multi uses a kind of "Oliver's Twist" in that the rationale behind the responses are that responder bids the cheapest suit he would not support at a higher level, So over 2@d  
|n^|5|at|
     2@h is "to play" if Opener has a weak 2 in @h's (but might have game interest opposite Spades.
|n^|5|at|
     2@s is "to play" if Opener has a weak 2 in @s's, but WILL have definite Game interest if Opener has a weak 2@h's.
|n^|5|at|
     2NT shows a strong hand and is forcing on Opener to show their Hand-type and Range.

Defending against Multi is a little like defending against a transfer pre-empt and, just as over my suggested defence to those, 2nd-in-hand has far more options than 4-in-hand, since they ARE guaranteed a second opportunity to bid (but bear in mind that, especially if Opener will always have a weak 2 in a Major and there is no strong option, Responder may pass with a weak hand and long diamonds).|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  In practice, 4th-in-hand's options are often limited by RHO's action.  So

If the bidding starts 
^c (2@d)   -   p   -   (2@s)   -   ???  ^L the weakish t/o of @s is not @2available, because 3@h by 4th  is now the jump-rebiddable @h suit 
^c (2@d)   -   p   -   (2@h)   -   2@s  ^L is still available as a weakish takeout  of @h
^c (2@d)   -   ^*bX^*n                         ^L is  11-15  for takeout
^c (2@d)   -   p   -   (2x)   -   p   -   (p)   -   ^*bX^*n  ^L is  16+  for takeout
^c (2@d)   -   2@h/@s    ^L are weakish takeouts of the  OTHER  Major
^c (2@d)   -   2NT       ^L is  16+  balanced, and
^c (2@d)   -   3x        ^L shows about 15-16 with a long strong suit
|lg|c|n^|0|at|^b@2
Dixon makes it relatively easy to defend against a Multi 2@d.

The ACBL and EBU get their knickers in a twist over the Multi, but, in reality, it's not that fearsome a weapon, especially if you are  ^*b2nd-in-hand^*n.

You are then usually guaranteed a 2nd chance to bid once you know what RHO has, and usually it's then just as if they'd opened a Weak Two in a Major.

If they show a strong option, then the chances are that you'll not be wanting to interfere anyway.|

lg|h|n^|0|at||
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  If you're  ^*b4th-in-hand^*n,  it's a little more tricky, since you are NOT guaranteed a 2nd chance to bid, but Dixon does help smooth the way.

Any questions or comments about Dixon or generally about defending against the Multi 2@d

The time to be careful is when there is NO strong option.

Some pairs just play 2@d as a weak two in either Major with no other option.

In those circumstances, it's not a true Multi and is normally NOT treated as forcing, so ^*b 2nd-in-hand ^*n is ^*b NOT ^*n guaranteed a second chance to bid.

So if that's the case, I would ditch Dixon entirely and just play naturally.   Responder is allowed to pass with a weak hand with long Diamonds.

Another example hand.|

fp|t-title|at|Defending  against  2 Suited Overcalls   -   Bergin|fp||at|      ^^^^|
lg|c|n^|0|at||
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Lastly, we come to defending against 2-suited overcalls, which we all tend to come up against every time we play Bridge.

2-suited overcalls such as Michaels, Unusual 2NT, Ghestem etc, can be difficult to defend against.

|fp|t-title|at|Bergin|fp||at|
|n^|5|at|
Bergin is a convention which gives you a bit of a structure to work around.
|lg|f|n^|0|at|
^*nBergin only applies ^*n when
^c^*bPartner ^*n has made a natural opening in a  ^*bSUIT^*n  and 
^bAND  
^c^*bOpps^*n  have overcalled showing a ^*b 2-suited hand ^*n with  EITHER
       ^e^*bone ^*n of the 2 suits specified 
^d OR  
       ^ewith ^*b both ^*n suits specified
|lg|c|n^|0|at|
Over partner's 1NT Opening and an overcall showing 2 different suits, best to use a different method
(eg: ^*b Lebensohl ^*n), because we don't even know if partner HAS a 5+ card suit, let alone which one it might be.

Knowing which suit partner has (and the Opps HAVING a suit) is crucial to how Bergin works.

Worth noting for Precision users that Bergin can be used only after a 1@h, 1@s or 2@c, Opening, NOT over a 1@d Opening, because that doesn't normally promise a Diamond suit (but if you play that it DOES promise Diamonds, then you can).|

lg|c|n^|0|at||
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  @2Bergin works on the basis that when Opps have shown a 2-suiter, with both suits specified, it's unlikely we're going to want to compete in either of those suits, so our options tend to be limited to 
^c@.   supporting partner, 
^c@.   showing the 4th suit, or 
^c@.   taking a penalty.

The scheme for Bergin when ^*b BOTH ^*n of Opps suits are known is as follows:

fp|t-title|at|Defending  against  2 Suited Overcalls   -   Bergin    BOTH  known|fp||at|      continued^^^^|
lg|c|n^|0|at||
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  The scheme for Bergin when ^*b BOTH ^*n of Opps suits are known is as follows: 
|n^|5|at|
^b  @.   DOUBLE is ostensibly for PENALTIES, showing values for defence and no fit for Partner's suit.
|n^|5|at|
^b  @.   CH@2EAPEST  available cue-bid shows a LIMIT or a FORCING raise in Opener's suit   (Opener assumes the limit raise and bids accordingly. If Opener signs off and Responder has the forcing raise, they bid on).
|n^|8|at|
So if partner opens 1@h and their LHO bids 2@h showing Spades and Diamonds, then a 2@s cue-bid of their @s suit shows either   a limit  OR  a forcing   raise  in partner's Hearts.        Partner assumes the limit raise and either eccepts the invitation or not.
|n^|8|at|
If Opener declines the invitation, then responder can bid on if they have the "forcing" raise.
|n^|5|at|
^b  @.   MORE EXPENSIVE  cue-bid is  EITHER  an invitational raise in Opener's suit  OR,  more commonly, a strong forcing bid showing length and strength in the 4th (unbid) suit.
|n^|8|at|
So in that sequence just above, partner opens 1@h and their LHO bids 2@h showing @s and Diamonds.
Now 3@d from Responder shows EITHER a definitely invitational raise in @h OR, more commonly, a FORCING hand with CLUBS.
|n^|8|at|
So if you have the invitational hand with support for Partner, this is a STRONGER "invitation" than the merely limit raise (the cheaper cue-bid) again, partner assumes the invitational raise in their suit and you convert to Clubs if you have the forcing raise in Clubs.
|n^|5|at|
^b  @.   BID of the ^*b 4th suit ^*n  is merely competitive and direct suit raises of Opener's Suit are merely competitive
     or pre-emptive.  So
|n^|9|at|
1@h  -  (2@h[Michaels])  -  3@h/4@h   are merely COMPETITIVE or pre-emptive in Hearts    and 
1@h  -  (2@h[Michaels])  -  3@c          is  merely COMPETITIVE in Clubs.

^bSo when BOTH of Opps' suits are known, we have LOTS of options available.|
