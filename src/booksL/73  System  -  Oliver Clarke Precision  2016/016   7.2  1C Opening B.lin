cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Hi Everyone and welcome to today's Precision Club session, in which we'll be continuing our look at the Precision 1@C Opening & Responses.

During the last session we looked at the requirements for the 1@C Opening, the negative, positive 4441 positive responses.

I'll be recapping the main points from that session again in a minute or so.

Tonight, the main 2 things we will be looking at in a bit more detail are two things I mentioned briefly last week, 4441 positive hands, and the Cambridge Heart Complex.


If you have not already done so, please have a look at the notes I have prepared on Precision Club bidding.

You can find these on: ^*h http://bbo.pigpen.org.uk/index.php ^*n

The notes on 1@C Openings can be found at ^*h http://bbo.pigpen.org.uk/1c.php^*n


You might want to have these on-screen in the background for reference during the session.|

fp|t-title|at|Re - cap|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Okay, a brief recap of what we covered in the last session: The 1@C Opening takes care of ANY hand which contains more 16 or more HCP.

The only exception (in this system) are hands in the 16-23 point range with any 4441 distribution, which are opened with 2@D (which we'll cover NEXT week).

The 1@C Opening shows 16+ points.  It says absolutely nothing about the Club suit and must be alerted.

The opening is unconditionally FORCING for ONE round.  In the event of a 1@D Negative response, subsequent bidding is normally natural and non-forcing.

Any response other than 1@D is a "positive" which makes the sequence Game-forcing.

The 1@D response shows 0-7 points and is a "negative" response.

Subsequent bidding is natural and non-forcing, although the 1@C Opener is obliged to respond to the 1@D response.

If the 1@C Opener has an absolute rock-crusher of a hand, they can jump-shift over the 1@D Negative.

This makes the sequence game-forcing, but Opener should bear in mind that partner may have nothing at all, so this move normally shows 24+ points with a decent suit.

Once we start using Asking Bids, this jump-shift into a new suit over the 1@D negative response is the only way Opener can force an Asking Bid sequence over a negative.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Positive Responses|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  The bids  1@H, 1@S, 1NT, 2@C and 2@D  are all positive responses showing 8+ points.

Show a 5-card Major before a 6-card or longer minor suit.

These responses are all game-forcing so although subsequent bidding is natural, it can be constructive with no need to jump to show extra strength.

Please note this: In this system we SWAP the 1@S and 1NT responses unless there is interference, so  

^c1@C - 1@S  ^fshows 8+ ^*bbalanced^*n     
^c1@C - 1NT  ^fshows 8+ with 5+ @s^*bSpades^*n@s.

5332 - shape hands almost always show a positive response in the long suit, especially if it is a Major.

Semi-balanced hands with a 5-card MINOR that are only marginal positives (8 - 10) will, as matter of course however, often use the 1@S response (^*bbalanced^*n 8+) because it is so much cheaper.

Ok, that recaps briefly what we covered last time apart from what I'll be covering in more detail tonight.

fp|t-title|at|Cambridge Heart Complex|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Let's start off looking at the Cambridge Heart Complex in a little more detail.

As we've seen our opening 1NT Bid is  10 - 12  when not vulnerable and  13 - 15  when vulnerable, balanced intermediate hands of the "wrong" range being opened  1@D.

1@C - 1@D - 1NT  shows  16 - 18  balanced and the continuations are identical to those over an Opening 1NT, except that since responder is KNOWN to be in the  0 - 7  range, we tend not to use the jump-shift responses.

So what do we do with 19+ balanced hands? One of the problems with Standard American, 2/1, Acol etc is that very strong balanced hands are not properly catered for.

20 - 22  point hands can be opened  2NT  and 23+ balanced hands with 2@C, but these waste a lot of space, especially when responder has some values.

If you are lucky enough to pick up a 26+ point balanced hand, SAYC or 2/1 has no precise or space efficient way to show that range.


|fp|t-title|at|History|fp||at|^^^^|
at|Back in the 1970's, my younger brother and I came up with something called the Cambridge Heart Complex.  

(The name comes from the fact that Paul was living in Cambridge at the time and I was visiting him LOL) for showing 16+ balanced (or semi-balanced with a 5-card Minor) hands.


^*bMM:^*n  That would be the Cambridge in England, of course.^*n|

fp|t-title|at|Advantages|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  This has a multitude of advantages: 

^c@.   Balanced hands up to 29 HCP are catered for in sensible ranges (up to 33 HCP with the Complex Sys).

^c@.   This is accomplished without "losing" any other bids.

^c@.   Since@2 ALL 16+ balanced hands are opened with 1@C, we lose no bidding space when Responder has a POSITIVE rather than a Negative response.

^b@2We achieve this "precision" by making 1@C - 1@D - 1@H  a  TWO-WAY  bid, showing either ...

^c(1)   Any 16+ hand with 5+ Hearts (and without same length or longer Spades), or ...

^c(2)   19+ balanced or semi-balanced with a 5-card Minor.

Responder normally makes an automatic relay in 1@S.

There are exceptions, when you are  0 - 4  with a Lo-o-o-o-o-o-ng Minor (Bid 2@C or 2@D), or when you are  5 - 7,  with 5-card Hearts  ^*bAND^*n  an outside Singleton (Bid 1NT with a Minor suit singleton and 2@H with a Spade Singleton).

A long Spade suit is less of a problem, since you can transfer into it and leave Opener there if necessary, without the sequence getting too expensive.

Over the 1@S Relay, Opener rebids as follows: 

^cwith  19+ balanced,   they rebid in NT's (more details of that in a minute).

^cwith   Hearts     ^g   they rebid something else (Not NT's) to describe their hand further.|

^b@2So you can see we're only rebidding  2NT  with  22+  balanced.  All the more expensive ranges are 2-points only.

So responder is in a good position to decide how high we can go.  The "Complex" (original) version of the system also has ways to show 30 - 31 and 32 - 33 point balanced hands.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  In case you're wondering why CHC stops at 29 HCP ?  The reason is that those methods do not form part of the core system these days as they are part of Multi-style openings that the ACBL do not permit at all, and which the EBU also dislike except in long team matches.

That's not a problem for me, since I never venture into ACBL land and the EBU has almost no "presence" on BBO.

Any questions so far on the CHC? 

ok, 


|fp|t-title|at|Continuations over Openers  NT  Rebids|fp||at|^^^^|
at|Let's look at responses over Opener's rebids.

Over the 1NT Rebids, the normal scheme of responses applies (Stayman, 4 - suit Transfers, 2-way 2@D, INTRO etc).

Over the 2NT and 3NT Rebids, we play PUPPET Stayman and 4-suit transfers.

This means that raises to 3NT have to go via Puppet Stayman.  

So that Opener can show a 22+ balanced Opening with a semi-balanced hand  ^*bcontaining a 5-card MAJOR^*n.|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Puppet Stayman|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  I don't propose to explain Puppet Stayman in great detail: 


... 2NT - 3@C  asks if Opener has a 5-card Major ?

^c3@h,  3@s   opener shows the 5-card Major if they have one

^c3@D      denies a 5-card Major but promises ^*bat least^*n  one 4-card  Major

^c3NT    denies holding a 4 or 5-card Major

Over   ...2NT - 3@C - 3@D, Responder bids the suit they  ^*bhave not got^*n  ie: 3@H with a 4-card SPADE suit, 3@S with a 4-card HEART suit   ^*BOR^*n   bids 4@D with 4-card suits in BOTH Majors.   

Now Opener bids the Major with a fit or 3NT otherwise.

This ensures that Opener declares the hand.

fp|t-title|at|Continuation Summary|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  The critical thing to take away from today is the fact that   1@C - 1@D - 1@H   is a TWO-way bid.

Responder almost always bids the 1@S Relay and now Opener clarifies their hand-type.

A bid in NT's shows a 19+ balanced range, but anything  ELSE  confirms the Heart suit and is natural.  So -

^c1@C - 1@D - 1@H(2-way) - 1@S(Relay) - 2@D    shows a @H/@D  2-suiter 

^c1@C - 1@D - 1@H(2-way) - 1@S(Relay) - 3@C    shows an upper-range (19+) @H/@C 2-suiter, at least 5 - 5+


As I said last week, there are some hand-types that do NOT bid the 1@S Relay: 

^c1@C - 1@D - 1@H(2-way) - 1NT  ^k5 - 7  HCP, 5+ Hearts and a Minor-suit shortage

^c1@C - 1@D - 1@H(2-way) - 2@C  ^k0 - 4  HCP  and 6+ @C

^c1@C - 1@D - 1@H(2-way) - 2@D  ^k0 - 4  HCP  and 6+ @D

^c1@C - 1@D - 1@H(2-way) - 2@H  ^k5 - 7  HCP  5+ Hearts and a Spade shortage

We don't have the time today to go into continuations over these exceptions.   They are all documented on my Precision website.

Essentially most of the bidding is natural and non-forcing.


Time for the first example hand.|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Obviously when Responder shows a Spade shortage, there's no need for any special mechanisms like that and the bidding just proceeds naturally.

As you can imagine, when Opener has a Heart suit as well, there's no need for any different mechanisms than these..

fp|t-title|at|Positive (8+) 4441 hands|fp||at|^^^^|
at|Last week I explained briefly how we handle POSITIVE (8+) 4441 hands.

This part of the system changed relatively recently to get rid of the old "Impossible Negative" and Semi - Positive responses and devote the 2@H, 2@S and 2NT Responses to 1@C to showing 4441 positives in the 8 - 11 point range.

^c1@C - 2@H   ^g8 - 11, exactly   4144   shape (Singleton Heart)

^c1@C - 2@S   ^g8 - 11, exactly   1444   shape (Singleton Spade)

^c1@C - 2NT   ^g8 - 11  ^*beither^*n    4414  ^*bor^*n  4441   shape (Minor suit Singleton)

^c1@C - 3@c@d@h@s    ^g  12+     ^*bany^*n      4441   shape, bidding the suit BELOW the singleton.

The  2@H  and  2@S  responses are just about the ONLY place in the entire system (except for cue - bids in natural sequences) where we show a shortage by bidding the short suit itself.|
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


bt||
nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Positive (8+) 4441 hands           cont|fp||at|^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|     The general scheme of continuations is as follows: 


|fp|t-title|at|Asking Bids NOT in use|fp||at|
^c@2Opener sets the suit, bids 3NT or can bid the KNOWN singleton suit (ie: a Major) as Blackwood (or whatever).

Over   1@C - 2NT - 3@C/@D,   if Opener has hit Responder's singleton, Responder bids 3NT.

If a fit has been identified, however, Responder can start cue - bidding or sign off.
^^
^b|fp|t-title|at|Asking Bids ARE in use|fp||at|
Opener sets the suit with an Eta Ask followed by Relay Beta or Epsilon, or can merely sign - off in No Trumps.

Opener can bid 2NT as Beta.

Over ^e1@C - 2NT - 3@C        ^iand
^e1@C - 2NT - 3@D,            ^d@2^iIf Eta is in use, an additional 1st step response is inserted to show a singleton in that suit rather than a 4-card holding.

^c@2If Responder shows a singleton, subsequent bidding is natural, except that Opener may make an Eta Ask in a SECOND suit as long as they can do so BELOW game level.

So  1@C - 2NT - 3@C(?) - 3@D(@Cx) - 3@S  is now Eta in Spades 

^b@2Redbird44:  In these sequences is opener bidding 4 card suits? 

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|     not necessarily but they're bidding RESPONDER's known 4-card suits.  Hence the use of Eta rather than some other Trump Asking Bid.               Ok, that covers the basic scheme of 4441 Positives and continuations.|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Interference over the  1@C  Opening|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|     What do we do, however, if Opps interfere immediately over the 1@C Opening ?

For the most part it depends on whether or not  2@H, 2@S and 2NT  are still at least a raise of the suit or a jump-shift.

After ^d1@C - (X)    - ???
^d1@C - (1@D) - ???
^d1@C - (1@H) - ???    our 4441 Positives are unaffected 

^b     (So ^d1@C - (1@H) - 2@H    still  shows 8-11, 4144 (Heart Singleton), etc.)

Over   ^d1@C - (1@S) - ???      2@H   is @2now required to show a Heart Positive, so the 2@S Response does "double duty" to show a singleton in either MAJOR suit.

^b@2Eta is still available in any of the 4 suits, but the extra step (to show a singleton) is available over Eta in either Major.

^b     (So ^d1@C - (1@S) - 2@S(8+, 4441, Major singleton)  -  3@H(Eta)  -  3@S      shows a @H singleton,

I know we've not covered the Asking Bids yet, but essentially the same mechanism serves if you're NOT using the Asking Bids.

Over ^d1@C - (1NT) - ???       2@H  and  2@S  are both required for Suit Positives.|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|     Over    1@C - (1NT) - ???       2@H  and  2@S  are both required for Suit Positives.

Depending on what the 1NT intervention shows:  Responder bids the cheapest 4-card MINOR they have, AS LONG AS it is NOT a suit that Opps have PROMISED.

So if 1NT shows "Both Majors or Both Minors", Opps have NOT specifically promised ANY particular suit, so Responder bids their cheapest 4-card Minor as a positive.

Clearly this will be indistinguishable from a 5-card Positive in that Minor, so Opener needs to be aware of the possibility of Responder only having a 4-card suit.

We've not changed the "minimum length" for Gamma in these sequences, so Responder just has to "lie" and treat their 4-card suit as a 5-card one.

If Responder cannot show a positive in a 4-card Minor, for whatever reason (eg: Opps have shown both Minors, or have shown one of the Minors and THAT is Responder's only 4-card Minor), then Responder either makes a trap Pass or a Double (showing 5 - 7), and later makes some kind of Impossible Negative response to show the suit below their singleton, or perhaps passes a re-opening double for penalties.

Time for some example hands (not just of interference).|

With no AB's, over 3@H setting the suit, South would cue bid their @D Ace and RKCB would get them to 6@H.

fp|t-title|at|2 Level  Interference  over  1@c|fp||at|^^^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Over  1@C - 2x,  none of our normal methods for showing 8 - 11 point 4441's are available,

^dand the 12+ 4441 positives will only be available as a jump-shift (perhaps at the 4-level).


Responder therefore uses one of the following methods (whichever seems most appropriate): 

^c@.   A cue bid of their suit (or one of Opps suits) at the 3-level
^fALWAYS shows a 4441 Positive (8+ unlimited) with a singleton in THAT suit.

^dSo    ^e 1@C - (2@D = Majors) - 2@S     shows 8+ unlimited, 4441 with a singleton Spade.


^c@.   Over ^e 1@C - (1NT) - ???                (ie: Trap Pass, Double or a 4-card positive in a Minor).

^dthus  ^e 1@C - (2@H = Majors) - 3@C    @2might be a normal 5+-card Positive, but could also be used with a 4441 hand with 4-card Clubs and a singleton Diamond (because if Responder had a Major suit singleton, they'd more likely cue - bid that Major).

^d@2So in these kinds of sequences, the ABSENCE of a cue - bid is quite informative.|

ht|d|at|^^|
cp||at|^*bMM:^*n|cp||at|  We all know we have to alert when playing  'proper'  bridge.

The laws of the game say that what we have to put in the alert is  ^*b our agreement with partner ^*n about that bid.

While creating these bridge movies, I have gone through and added to, or amended, many of the alerts that were in the original text.

I have changed them from being ^*b REAL ^*n alerts, that you should give to real opponents, and have replaced them with ^*b STUDY ^*n alerts.   Study alerts are only useful to students of Oliver's Precision.  Of course in many cases no changes were needed.   For example    1@c     16+ Any dist except 16-23 4441

It is particularly important that we make the alerts for  ^*b Asking bids and their responses^*n,  as clear as possible

	    ^c ^*b Study Alert ^*n           ^i ^*b Real Alert ^*n                ^o ^*b It would be great if you could add ^*n
     ^b      @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@- ^h       @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-   ^n       @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-
		^c Beta    Relay Beta ...          ^i Gen Ctrl Ask                    ^o A = 2,  K = 1 
		^c Alpha                           ^i Asking  in                      ^o Trump ...
		^c Gamma                           ^i Asking  in partners suit        ^o Trump ...
		^c Epsilon                         ^i Specific Ctrl Ask               ^o in ... 
		^c Hxx                             ^i Hxx                             ^o in ... 
		^c none  or  1st & 2nd             ^i none  or  1st & 2nd             ^o [xxx, AKx(x)]
		^c 3rd rd ctrl                     ^i 3rd rd ctrl                     ^o [xx, Qxx(x), Qx]
		
An easy mistake in reply to an Epsilon is when, say, you hold ^*b Q76 ^*n in the suit, and so give only ^*b Qxx ^*n in the alert.   THAT  IS  WRONG.  The agreement is ^*b 3rd round control ^*n and that is what should be told to the opps.   

The ^*b ethical ^*n problem with telling too much to your opps is that it disadvantages the other pairs who will play your opponents cards.|

at|           Good practical decision, May   as West is bound to have spade honours.

With all the wasted values in @H, 3NT much better than hoping for the @SA and some miracle fit to make 6@D.

Indeed, East might just use  Beta 2NT  over 2@H and then sign off in 3NT
^rAny questions?|
