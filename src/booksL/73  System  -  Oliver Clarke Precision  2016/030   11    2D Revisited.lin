cp|red|at|^*blute57:^*n|cp||at|   One final point about Responder's nebulous  2@H  Inquiry bid is it always ^*b DENIES ^*n having a Super Bid.
^^

^*b 3NT ^*n ^e 14+ points with at least 4-cards in ^*b BOTH ^*n Minors
^b@2
There is  ^*b NO ^*n  super bid with Showing 4 Hearts and 4 of a minor.    So such hands have to use the 2@h Inquiry.
Distributions of  5-4  or  5-5  are better but are not needed for any of these Super Bids.
However with better than  4-4  shape you can shade the  14+ hcp  requirement to match your distribution.  So the 14+ points level is sometimes referred to as  'notional'.
|n#|9|at|Since 2013, despite only promising 14 points, should responder ever need to answer a Beta Ask then they use the ^*b Strong Scale ^*n (0-4 first step) normally only used by 16+ point hands.

Let's look at each of these Super Bids in more detail:|

^s(An Extract from the Lesson)^^^^|
Lg|b|n#|4|
cp|red|at|^*blute57:^*n|cp||at|   3NT is the easiest of the three Super Bids to wrap your head around.

Responder's  3NT ^f Super Bid promises:   14+ HCP  and at least  4-4  in the ^*b Minors^*n,    ( 4 @d's   &   4 @c's )

^*bOpener bids her best 4-card minor^*n.     That bid is a ^*b Gamma ^*n Ask in the suit.

Responder uses Gamma stepped responses (using minimum expected length of 4-cards).

Opener can continue the Asking Bid sequence using Relay Beta and/or Epsilon Asks.
^^
With the 3NT Super Bid  ^*b Opener ^*n is always the ^*b Asker ^*n (the one doing all the Asking).

^*bResponder ^*n will be always be ^*b Teller ^*n (the one doing the stepped responses).^^|

^s(An Extract from the Lesson)^^^^|
Lg|b|n#|4|
cp|red|at|^*blute57:^*n|cp||at|   2NT is the next of the three Super Bids.

Responder's  2NT ^f Super Bid promises:   14+ HCP  and at least  4-4  in the ^*b Majors^*n,    ( 4 @s's   &   4 @h's )

Opener's response (and the subsequent Asking Bid sequence) depends upon where her singleton lies.

This also determines who is  ^*b Asker ^*n and who ^*b Teller^*n.
^^
^*bOn hearing the  2NT  Super bid: ^*n

|cp|u|at|^d(so Openers response of a minor promises (that minor) and 4-4 in both Majors)|cp||at|

Responder can make a subsequent Eta Ask in the best of his two 4 card majors.

Responder can continue the Asking Bid sequence using Relay Beta and/or Epsilon Asks.
|lg|c|at|
Responder can also make an immediate Short Beta Ask in Opener's known Minor suit singleton; but if he goes this immediate route, he must then place the final contract.

Using the Short Beta Ask ^*n later ^*n (as opposed to immediately) keeps the Asking Bid sequence ON.|

cp|red|at|^*blute57:^*n|cp||at|    Remembering that:

|cp|u|at|^d(so Openers response of a Major promises (that Major) and 4-4 in both minors)|cp||at|

As this action promises only one 4-card Major, it is treated drastically differently from that of having both Majors.
^^
Opener's bid is a |cp|red|at|^*b Gamma Ask ^*N|cp||at| in ^*b that Major ^*n (the bid Major, in which Opener has 4 cards).

Now, the roles are reversed  (v. minor suit singleton).   Opener becomes  ^*b Asker ^*n and Responder becomes ^*b Teller^*n.

Responder now makes a ^*b Gamma ^*n response (minimum length 4).

Opener can continue the  Asking Bid  sequence using  Relay Beta  and/or  Epsilon Asks.|

^^
^*bOn hearing the  3@s    Super bid: ^*n
|n#|8|fp|t-tile|at|  Opener treats this bid of  3@s  as ^*b Eta ^*n   BUT   adds in an additional response.|fp||at|

|n^|3|at|^cThis additional response, which is ^*b always ^*n added and says |fp|t-title|at|  -   Your (@s) bid hit my singleton.|fp||at|

|n^|8|at|^e( T@2his follows the same pattern used in the sequence   1@C  -  2NT  -  3@C/3@D(Eta),  where 
again the  Eta Ask  could land on the singleton  and the extra step is always added. )
^c@2
As the   1st  step  Eta response  is modified to show a singleton,
the        2nd step  response  now has the normal first step meaning (Jxxx / xxxx),  etc.
^b@2

|n#|3|at|If Opener responds ^*b 3NT ^*n     (saying    'you hit my singleton'):
|n#|8|fp|t-tile|at|  Responder continues by bidding his unspecified Minor as an ^*b Eta ^*n Ask|fp||at|

ht|f|at|^*bMM: ^*n Oliver is still away moving house and home and without internet connection.  So this week I am starting with the class that Oliver gave last year.  I will then switch to John Lute's class which has a far more detailed approach in the examples, but but being a talk based lesson has much less text for me to show you.


|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Hi Everyone and welcome to today's Precision Club session, in which we'll be taking a second look at 
the 2@d Opeing now that we have started using Asking Bids.

If you have not already done so, please have a look at the notes I have prepared on Precision Club bidding.

You can find these on: ^*h http://bbo.pigpen.org.uk/index.php ^*n

You might want to have these onscreen in the background for reference during the session.

The notes on 2@d can be found at ^i ^*h http://bbo.pigpen.org.uk/2d.php ^*n

fp|t-title|at|2@d  Opening  Revisited|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Ok, we've already looked at the 2@d Opening, which shows  16-23 point  hands with ANY 4441 distribution.

In most of the sequences the only Asking Bid that is available is Beta, asking about opener's general level of Controls.

The reason for this is that unless Responder is quite strong, Opener shows their shape and range and then responder decides the final contract.

The  2@d Opening is forcing Responder to bid but we have no guarantee that they have any HCP or even a fit with any of our suits, so we have to give them the ability to sign off at as low a level as possible.

So the   2@d - 2@h   sequences are geared mainly to that.    So if responder bids 2@h over 2@d, Opener then shows their  Range  and  Shape  and because Responder can be very weak we cannot allow asking bids except for Beta in the declared singleton suit.

There are, however, 3 responses where Responder shows 14+ (notionally) and now we are usually heading for an Asking Bid sequence, since Opener is 16-23.

I say notionally 14+ but this can be shaded if Responder has a distributional 2-suited hand and feels that slam likely given that Opener must have a fit for at least one of their suits.


The 3 responses where Responder shows a decent hand are what we're going to concentrate on tonight: |

cp|red|at|^*blute57:^*n|cp||at|  Although the system's 2@D Opening promises 16-23 HCP and 4441 distribution, there are only three Responder SUPER bids which can give rise to OCP's famed Asking Bid sequences .

|fp|t-title|at|2NT,   3@S   and   3NT|fp||at|

Before we get to these very strong bids, let's have some examples of general hands opposite the 2@D opening.|

fp|t-title|at|2@d  Opening  Revisited|fp||at|^^^^|
Lg|d|n#|4|
cp|red|at|^*blute57:^*n|cp||at|   It is true that Responder's nebulous 2@H Inquiry bid does allow a possible future Short Beta bid but if Responder goes that route, Responder must subsequently set the final contract.

It matters not whether Opener responds weakly with 2@S (further limiting the opening to 16-19 HCP) or whether Opener responds strongly with 2NT through 3@S (promising 20-23 HCP and a singleton in the suit above) to Responder's 2@H Inquiry bid.

Responder simply cannot initiate any Asking Bid sequences after his/her nebulous  2@H  Inquiry bid.

The logic here is Responder 2@H Inquiry bid might have to be made when Responder has (zero) 0 HCP.

Responder's options  2@S, 3@C, 3@D and 3@H  bids promise weak hands with a 6-card suit.

And as mentioned, Responder's  2NT, 3@S and 3NT  options are the SUPER bids.

So lacking a 6-card suit, Responder has no way to show an extremely weak hand except by merging their pathetic hand type into the nebulous  2@H  Inquiry bid.

Therefore, after Opener further describes his hand, Responder must set the final contract.

There are ^*b NO ^*n Asking sequences.

     more examples...|

There is  ^*b NO ^*n  super bid with Showing 4 Hearts and 4 of a minor.    So such hands have to use the 2@h Inquiry.
Distributions of  5-4  or  5-5  are better but are not needed for any of these Super Bids.
However with better than  4-4  shape you can shade the  14+ hcp  requirement to match your distribution.  So the 14+ points level is sometimes referred to as  'notional'.
|n#|9|at|Since 2013, despite only promising 14 points, should responder ever need to answer a Beta Ask then they use the ^*b Strong Scale ^*n (0-4 first step) normally only used by 16+ point hands.

Let's look at each of these Super Bids in more detail:|

Lg|d|n#|4|
cp|red|at|^*blute57:^*n|cp||at|   3NT is the easiest of the three Super Bids to wrap your head around.

Responder's 3NT Super Bid promises:    14+ HCP and at least  4-4  distribution in the Minors.

^*bOpener bids her best 4-card minor^*n.     That bid is a ^*b Gamma ^*n Ask in the suit.

Responder uses Gamma stepped responses (using minimum expected length of 4-cards).

Opener can continue the Asking Bid sequence using Relay Beta and/or Epsilon Asks.
^^
With the 3NT Super Bid  ^*b Opener ^*n is always the ^*b Asker ^*n (the one doing all the Asking).

^*bResponder ^*n will be always be ^*b Teller ^*n (the one doing the stepped responses).
^^
Example time ...
^^

^c^*bMM:^*n  @2One problem at about this point is that the audio recording of John's voice failed at around this point so you will have to put up my analysis of the hands.

Lg|b|n#|4|
cp|red|at|^*blute57:^*n|cp||at|   2NT is the next of the three Super Bids.

Responder's 2NT Super Bid promises 14+ HCP and at least  4-4  in the ^*b Majors,^*n    ( 4 @s's   and   4 @h's )

Opener's response (and the subsequent Asking Bid sequence) depends upon where her singleton lies.

This also determines who is  ^*b Asker ^*n and who ^*b Teller^*n.
^^
^*bOn hearing the  2NT  Super bid: ^*n
|n#|8|fp|t-tile|at|  If Opener's singleton is in a Minor suit  then ^*b Opener bids the |cp|red|at|other|cp||at| Minor^*n|fp||at|

|cp|u|at|^d(so Openers response of a minor promises (that minor) and 4-4 in both Majors)|cp||at|

Responder can make a subsequent Eta Ask in the best of his two 4 card majors.

Responder can continue the Asking Bid sequence using Relay Beta and/or Epsilon Asks.
|lg|c|at|
Responder can also make an immediate Short Beta Ask in Opener's known Minor suit singleton; but if he goes this immediate route, he must then place the final contract.

Using the Short Beta Ask ^*n later ^*n (as opposed to immediately) keeps the Asking Bid sequence ON.

If partner does have the 4 then just asking with 5NT would commit us to 7@H and that can't be an 80% chance from what we (as North) know.  On a bad day we could be down in  6@h  if partner has only 2 controls.  So I am going for ...|

As partner is unlikely to ^*b also ^*n have the singleton @sK  then their hand will be   @sx   @hK??x   @dAK?x   @cKQJx   which accounts for all 16 points that South has promised with the 2@d opening.   If we assume a 3-2 split in @d's and @c's  we can count   1@s  2@H  4@d  4@c  giving 11 tricks.  In addition we can try for either two spade ruffs or two heart ruffs.  Even so as 13 tricks are not at all certain I would stick with 6.   But I will let you play it in ...|

We have 8 spades between us with one top honour missing.  We also have a total of 10 controls.  Which are, given the reply on the spades, likely to be the two (unseen) Kings,  @sK @dK.  So the choices are stop here in 5   or   go straight to 6.   Your call is ?|

Lg|c|n#|4|
cp|red|at|^*blute57:^*n|cp||at|   Direct use of  ^*b Short Beta ^*n

Responder ^*b can make ^*n an |cp|red|at|^*b immediate |cp||at| Short Beta Ask ^*n in Opener's known singleton 
^f^*b BUT ^*n if he goes this immediate route, he must then place the final contract on hid next bid.

The above logic stems from Opener's perspective.

If Responder fails to establish trumps first,  how can Opener know  whether  Responder's subsequent bid after the immediate Short Beta is sign-off   OR  an Asking Bid ?        Opener cannot possibly know.

But what if Responder first establishes the trump suit ?
^e In that case, Asking bids remain ON and  Relay Beta  becomes the Beta of choice in most cases.

However, when the singleton suit is known, one should be aware there can still exist a Short Beta (singleton suit) that can be accessed for Repeat Beta if the Relay Beta response was ambiguous.   Eg:

^c2@D   -   3@S   -   3NT[singleton hit]   -   4@D[Eta]   -   4@S[Hxxx]   -   4NT[Relay Beta]   -   5@C[0-4 ctrls]    -   ???

Here Asker can use  5@S  as ^*b Repeat Beta ^*n (but beware the Weak Response Scale used for Repeat Beta can be very expensive). ^g Change the example slightly: 

^c2@D   -   3@S   -   3NT[singleton hit]   -   4@D[Eta]   -   4@S[Hxxx]   -   4NT[Relay Beta]   -   5@D[5 controls]   -   ???

Now Responder's (Asker's)  5@S  bid becomes an ^*b Epsilon Ask ^*N (using the Epsilon response scale reserved for ^*b singletons ^*n in 4441 hands) as there is no ambiguity in the Beta response.|

cp|red|at|^*blute57:^*n|cp||at|   ^*n Relay Beta ^*n  versus ^*n  Short Beta^*n 
^^
Which has priority when BOTH exist at the same time?   Relay Beta, becomes the Beta of choice in most cases.

In some cases, BOTH manifest themselves in the same bid.     Eg:

^c 2@D   -   3@S   -   3NT[singleton hit]   -   4@D[Eta]   -   4@H[xxxx/Jxxx]   -   4@S[Relay Beta/Short Beta]

There is one case where Short Beta wins out over Relay Beta.  This is when the Short Beta is the next suit up
ie: the suit ^*b one above ^*n the Relay suit.

It would be a waste of bidding space to have two Beta bids existing at the same time in the auction where they were essentially adjoining each other.
^w@3
^e( T@2his is similar to last weeks class where we discussed interference immediately following a positive response to a strong 1@C opening.  In that situation, Opener's Pass is normally Gamma but having natural Gamma one above takes precedence. )  
^b@2^z@3
So where Short Beta is ^*b one above ^*n the Relay suit,  the Relay suit become a natural  Epsilon Ask
^q and ^*b Short Beta ^*n is the ^*b Beta of choice^*n.

^d Time for more examples...|

ht|d|at|^^|
cp||at|^*bMM:^*n|cp||at|  We all know we have to alert when playing  'proper'  bridge.

The laws of the game say that what we have to put in the alert is  ^*b our agreement with partner ^*n about that bid.

While creating these bridge movies, I have gone through and added to, or amended, many of the alerts that were in the original text.

I have changed them from being ^*b REAL ^*n alerts, that you should give to real opponents, and have replaced them with ^*b STUDY ^*n alerts.   Study alerts are only useful to students of Oliver's Precision.  Of course in many cases no changes were needed.   For example    1@c     16+ Any dist except 16-23 4441

It is particularly important that we make the alerts for  ^*b Asking bids and their responses^*n,  as clear as possible

	    ^c ^*b Study Alert ^*n           ^i ^*b Real Alert ^*n                ^o ^*b It would be great if you could add ^*n

		^c Beta    Relay Beta ...          ^i Gen Ctrl Ask                    ^o A = 2,  K = 1 
		^c Alpha                           ^i Asking  in                      ^o Trump ...
		^c Gamma                           ^i Asking  in partners suit        ^o Trump ...
		^c Epsilon                         ^i Specific Ctrl Ask               ^o in ... 
		^c Hxx                             ^i Hxx                             ^o in ... 
		^c none  or  1st & 2nd             ^i none  or  1st & 2nd             ^o [xxx, AKx(x)]
		^c 3rd rd ctrl                     ^i 3rd rd ctrl                     ^o [xx, Qxx(x), Qx]
		
An easy mistake in reply to an Epsilon is when, say, you hold ^*b Q76 ^*n in the suit, and so give only ^*b Qxx ^*n in the alert.   THAT  IS  WRONG.  The agreement is ^*b 3rd round control ^*n and that is what should be told to the opps.   

The ^*b ethical ^*n problem with telling too much to your opps is that it disadvantages the other pairs who will play your opponents cards.|

cp||at|^*bMM:^*n|cp||at|  If we decide to continue (and not stop in 5@d) we are committed to  @d6  so the ONLY REASON to continue is to try to bid the 7D Grand Slam.   But wait we already know that we have exactly  9 @d's  between us  AND are ^*b missing ONE ^*n of the top 3 honours.  Even assuming that this is the @dQ  that means there will be a loser just under half the time (@d's break 3-1 and @dQ is not singleton  PLUS  half the time they break 4-0 )    =   50% * 3/4 + 10% / 2  =  42.5% for GOING DOWN.    Grands need to be 90% plus to make sense.   I vote 6@d.|

We are missing the  @s  OR   both minor Kings.   Where are we going to get 12 tricks from ?   Assuming partner has the minor kings then    4@h  2@d  3@c  and say two @s ruffs    that gets us eleven but if missing the kings ?
But I admit there is a good case to be made that I am too pessimistic here.    But can  YOU  make that case ?|
