ht|f|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Well time to make a start.

Hi Everyone and welcome to today's Precision Club session, in which we'll be taking a look at the Precision 2@H and 2@S Openers, and at the modified 2NT Opening used in my version of Precision.

You can find these on:  ^*h http://bbo.pigpen.org.uk ^*n  You might want to have these onscreen in the background for reference during the session.



|fp|t-title|at|2@H and 2@S Openings|fp||at|^^

Okay, the Precision 2@H and 2@S Openings shows 5-9 points and a 6-card suit.            Note:  5-9  ^*bnot^*n  6-10 

They are weak 2's just like you use when playing Standard American or 2/1.

Ideally, your points should be concentrated in your long suit for greater playing strength, but this is not always able to be the case.

The optimum time to use a weak 2 Opening is, like when pre-empting, when you are 3rd-in-hand after 2 passes.

This is because partner is a passed hand (so you're definitely NOT making life difficult for them) and your Left-hand Opponent is probably a fairly strong hand (so you ARE making life more difficult for THEM!!).|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  The worst position in which to pre-empt is when you are 2nd-in-hand.

Now your RHO is known to be reasonably weak, so you have a 50% chance that it's your PARTNER you are pre-empting rather than your opponents.

1st in hand isn't ideal, but at least now you have only a 33% chance that it's your partner who has a strong hand.

Similarly, pre-empting when 4th-in-hand is normally a bit silly (who are you pre-empting?), UNLESS you have a BURSTING MAXIMUM weak 2 (ie: it's almost intermediate rather than weak).

In this system a 4th-in-hand 2@H or 2@S Opening is treated as GOOD intermediate strength, not weak.

Similarly, having 4-card length in the OTHER Major is sometimes viewed as a minus factor.

I would never say "never" in this regard, though.

If partner HAS already passed then the chances of missing a better contract in the other Major is very low (because if you don't open your weak 2, the chances are that your side side might not get into the bidding at all) but if you are the dealer or 2nd-in-hand I would tend to be more cautious.

3rd-in-hand, after 2 passes, though, (and especially at favourable vulnerability) I would tend to take ANY opportunity to make life difficult for Opps ...so having a poor weak 2 or a 4-card Major alongside it wouldn't stop me What you ought to be a little more careful about is the vulnerability.

Using a Weak 2 Opening at FAVOURABLE vulnerability is the best time (ie: they are vulnerable and you are not) and at Love All is also fine.

At Game All I would be a little more circumspect and it would be a rare occasion indeed that I opened a weak 2 at UNFAVOURABLE vulnerability, when we are vulnerable and they are not.|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  So the ideal hand for a weak 2 Opening of  2@H  or  2@S  is 
^c@2
@.   3rd in hand after 2 passes 

@.   FAVOURABLE Vulnerability

@.   Points concentrated in your long suit

@.   No 4-card length in the OTHER Major, especially if the first point doesn't apply (ie: Partner not a passed hand).
^b@2
As I said you cannot always wait for the perfect situation where ALL of the above apply, but if 2 or more of the above do not apply, then that may be a good indication that now is not the right time.
^^
Any questions or comments on the requirements for a weak 2 and the do's and don'ts of when to open one?

ok
^^

So the requirements for a Precision Weak 2 opening are little or no different to those in other systems.

What you WILL find is different are the responses and continuations.

If you want to play your "normal" methods (eg: 2NT as Ogust or "asking for a feature") then that's fine but, particularly once you've got the rest of the system under your belt, the methods I'm about to outline sit better with the overall system.

There is no reason why (with a little adaptation) you can't play these methods with any other system, of course.|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  The 2NT Response to a 2@H or 2@S Weak 2 is LEBENSOHL, forcing a 3@C relay from Opener after which Responder will sign off in a suit or 3NT or invite in Opener's Major.

This always gives partner an exit route if they really cannot tolerate your Major and feel they have something better to offer.

What partner bids after the  2NT - 3@C  relay is 100% NON-FORCING unless it's obviously invitational. eg a non-game level jump in some other suit, such as     2@H - 2NT - 3@C - 5@S - ???

Direct suit raises of Opener's Major are PURELY, 100%, pre-emptive, and at the 3-level are NOT invitational in any way.

Obviously a jump to the 4-level in your Major might well be concealing a decent hand, but one not interested in slam A Relay in the NEXT SUIT up  (ie: 2@H - 2@S and 2@S - 3@C)  are a special Forcing Enquiry asking for a further description of Opener's hand.

This is probably the most common route Responder will use to explore for game.

I will go through those two in detail in a minute.

A Relay in the SECOND SUIT up  (ie:  2@H - 3@C   or    2@S - 3@D)  is Gamma in Opener's Major, an Asking Bid asking for information about Opener's Major.

I'll not deal further with this now as we'll cover it when we look at Asking Bids in a few weeks.

Suffice it to say that this unconditionally agrees Opener's Major as trumps and we're now in an Asking Bid sequence.

If you're using these methods with a different system than Precision, you'll have to figure out some alternative use for these bids and continuations over them (eg: Ace-Asking, Asking for cue-bids or whatever).

Responses other than this are deprecated (ie: we strongly suggest you don't do it LOL) but are natural and 100% forcing.|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


qx|R1,wide|
nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  If Responder has a weak hand then they either pass or use Lebensohl to sign off.

With a strong hand they more normally take control of the auction using one of the methods outlined, most frequently the Forcing Enquiry.

Bear in mind that if Responder has a strong hand but not much support for Opener's Major, it will usually be better to play in Opener's Major (the weak hand) in order to get SOME use from their hand (which will likely be largely useless if the hand is played in any other suit).

This, of course, applies in many other situations, but it almost always holds true UNLESS you have game in your own hand and a distinct shortage in partner's suit.

Any questions on the general scheme of responses before we look in particular at the Forcing Enquiry sequences?


A Relay in the next suit up is, as I've said, a forcing enquiry asking Opener for a further description of their hand.

Opener rebids along the following lines: 


^c^*bRule 1^*n       With  ^*ball^*n  MINIMUM  hands Opener rebids    2NT  (over 2@H - 2@S)   or   3@S (over 2@S - 3@C).


^*bAny responses other than the two above show    upper range   hands^*n

thus

2@H - 2@S - 3@D   shows a Spade shortage, and

^bOver a 2@S Opening, the scheme is slightly different:

at|    Naughty East at unfavourable vul LOL.

Here, obviously, East would just PASS given North's double with any lower range hand.

In our system we use bids in any KNOWN short suit to ask about Controls.  So normally this (3@d) would be Beta (when Asking Bids are in operation), but for tonight we'll treat it as RKCB 0314.|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  So here West can be sure that East has the K@H and an outside Ace in a Black Suit, and little else apart from their Diamond shortage but the fit looks perfect 23 - HCP small slam, not bad.

It would be not quite as good if East had the @SA rather than the @CA, but that's less likely given the double by North.

So here, identifying the Diamond shortage in East's hand was enough to allow West to safely explore for slam.|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  If East had shown up with, for example, a Club shortage, West would probably just sign off in game.

For those not at all familiar with this system, we tend to show shortages by bidding the suit BELOW the shortage, specifically to allow CHEAP Control asking bids in the short suit, as just shown here.

Bidding the shortage to  ASK  runs right through the system.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Now to :

^c^*bRule 3^*n       A 3NT @2rebid shows an upper range hand with more scattered values and most likely 6322 distribution (eg: 2@H - 2@S - 3NT    and     2@S - 3@C - 3NT).
^b@2
^^
ian302:   is the response for a void the same as singleton? 

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Yes BUT If you have a VOID anywhere, then you, almost by definition, have a second suit of at least 4-card length which brings me nicely to...
^^
^c^*bRule 4^*n       4-level @2new suits (and  2@H - 2@S - 3@S)  show a 2nd 4-card or longer suit in the suit bid
^h    (eg:    2@H - 2@S - 4@C,     or         2@S - 3@C - 4@D).
^b@2

Clearly these hands will ALSO have a shortage, but better to show the second suit if it is 4-card or more.
^^
So it's more CONSTRUCTIVE to show a second suit rather than showing a shortage.
^^
Partner will know you have a shortage in at least ONE of the other 2 suits, but now they have more of an idea how the hand is fitting.

So if the 2nd suit was a very weak one (xxxx) then I might show a void in preference, but if it was Hxxx, I'd always show the suit rather than any shortage.|

If Opps intervene over the Forcing Enquiry, Opener generally bids using the   ^*bRules^*n   if they can still do so.  

If they cannot complete their normal response, then PASS shows a lower-range hand and Double or Redouble shows an upper-range hand (or perhaps lower-range but with a shortage in a suit Opps have bid).


If Opps intervene directly over the Weak 2 Opening, then Responder's actions are along the following lines:
^c@2
@.   Direct-suit raises are purely pre-emptive

@.   New Suits are forcing

@.   Dou@2ble (or 2NT in the sequence 2@H - (2@S) - 2NT)  is Lebensohl, forcing a relay in the next suit up by Opener, after which bids in new suits are non-forcing and "to play", and bids in Opener's Major are invitational

^c@.   Bids of 3NT are natural and "to play" A redouble over a t/o double you can treat as the Forcing Enquiry, if you like.

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Any questions in interference?  or on the responses to the Forcing Enquiry 


lute57:  what would Opener bid with a minimum if   2@H - (X) - XX?

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Pass sounds good :)    but 2NT is systemic.   After all, Partner might have an absolute monster and be looking for slam regardless.


lute57:  Do we use fast/slow 3NT here, over an overcall 

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  2@S-(2@S)-2NT is Leb, so a SLOW 3NT will always be "to play".

I suppose in theory a FAST 3NT would be natural but without a @S stop, but I can't imagine ever using it, since the Weak 2 Opener can hardly be relied on to have good enough Spades sat underneath the 2@S bidder 
2@S - (2@S) - 2NT   is Leb,    so a SLOW 3NT will always be "to play".


kritter2 (shirl):  would   2@H - (X) - XX - 2NT   be Lebensohl to show lower range and relay to 3 clubs to sign off in^^^e 3 hearts?

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Shirl, 2NT is simply showing a minimum.  It's NOT Lebensohl   You might decide to pass the XX, but systemically you can still show your minimum hand and probably should do so.

The only time I might consider passing the XX is at unfavourable vul, when redoubled overtricks are SO lucrative.

Any more questions on 2@H and 2@S Openings?


Okay, next up is the 2NT Opener.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|2 No Trump   Opener|fp||at|^^
|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  In "Classic" Precision, the  2NT Opener  shows a strong balanced hand in the 20-22 range and continuations can be whatever you like.

In my view this is a complete waste of a bid and the system I teach would open such hands with 1@C and we have methods to show different ranges of 16+ balanced hands.

In the system I teach, 2NT is a Multi-style Opening showing one of the following hand-types: 

^c@.  A pre-empt in Clubs 

^c@.  5-9 points and AT LEAST 5-5 in the Minors  

^c@.  11-15 points and EXACTLY 5-5 in the Majors
^^

This Opening (2NT), solves a number of problem areas for the system: 


^cFirstly,      it @2gives us a Club pre-empt that we don't have otherwise.   
(In this system the 3@C Opening is 11-15 with 6-card Clubs and a 4-card Major).

^cSecondly, the Intermediate hand with both Majors makes life easier for Responder when Opener shows a
 Major 2-suiter after a 1@S Opening.

^cLastly,      the "unusual" hand with 5-5+ in the Minors is VERY pre-emptive.|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


qx|RA,wide|
nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  If you've not used Multi-style Openings before, please do not be put off by the apparent complexity, because the Responses are surprisingly simple to understand: 

Those of you who are familiar with what we've been calling "Oliver's Twist" will recognise the logic behind the scheme of responses to the Multi 2NT Opening.


^c^*bRule A^*n     With @2a hand that has no game interest opposite the Minors or a Club Pre-empt, Responder gives their preference between the Minors at the 3-level.
^b@2

Responder should always give preference to CLUBS when even-suited or nearly so (in case Opener has the Club pre-empt).

So partner ASSUMES you have the weak Minor 5-5+ hand and assuming partner has no game interest opposite the Minors or a Club Pre-empt she then chooses between the Minors.

If Responder has game interest ONLY opposite the Majors then she will also go this route, since Opener will relay in 3@D or 3@H up to show the Majors. (2NT - 3@C -  3@D shows an upper range hand with both Majors and 3@H shows lower range).

So   2NT - 3@C - 3@D   and   2NT - 3@D - 3@H   both show the Major 5-5 hand.

Otherwise Opener passes with the Minor 5-5+ hand (or the Club pre-empt if Responder bids 3@C), or bids 3NT to show the Club pre-empt over   2NT - 3@D 
^^

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  This leads us to 

^c^*bRule B^*n    If @2Responder has an INVITATIONAL hand with good support for at least one Minor and at least one Major, then they will tend to give preference between the MAJORS at the 3-level.
^b@2
Now Opener passes or bids 4 of the Major with the Majors (depending on range), bids 4@C with both Minors, or 3NT with the Club pre-empt.|
pg| ***** 106 ***** |


at|^^^^^^With a strong balanced hand wanting to play in 3NT opposite the Club Pre-empt or both Minors, and to play in (at least) game opposite the Majors, Responder bids 3NT.

Now Opener passes with the Club pre-empt or both Minors, bids 4@C with both Majors and 4@D/4@H with a very distributional hand with both Minors (one really unsuitable for 3NT).

Over the 4@C rebid there is a 4@D Forcing Enquiry, details of which can be found on the website.


So 2NT-3NT is just "to play" if Opener has Clubs or both Minors, but FORCING is they have both Majors 


now to a third (similar) example|

Lute57:  Is Hxx also considered good support regarding those invitational hands with good support in one Major and one Minor? 

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   In extremis, yes, but I'd rather have 4-card support.|
pg| ***** 112 ***** |


bt||
nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Now for the slightly more complicated case ...

With a strong DISTRIBUTIONAL hand, which is unconditionally forcing on Opener to show their hand-type and range, Responder bids 4@C and now a 4@D Rebid from Opener shows the Majors, 4@H shows the Minors, and 4NT shows the Club Pre-empt.

There are further specified continuations, but these mainly come into play once we've started using Asking Bids.

Again, we'll revisit these sequences once we've got Asking Bids under our belt later in the year.

The 3NT and 4@C Responses are quite rare and most often Responder simply chooses between the Minors at the 3-level, perhaps showing interest if Opener then shows the Majors.


|fp|t-title|at|ACBL  Land|fp||at|^^
If you play in ACBL-land, by the way, you will NOT be able to use the 2NT Opening as I have described it ...as it's definitely mid-Chart, if not higher but I think I'm right in saying that playing it solely as "Unusual" with weak Minors is not a problem.

Easy enough to absorb the hands with both Majors into the 1@S Opening but you will have to give up on 3-level Club pre-empts (no massive loss).

If you want any advice on playing this system in ACBL-land, best to contact either Dianas or nfmfl, who have played good level Pairs tournaments in the USA using this system.  Maybe some others have navigated the ACBL waters as well, but I'm not aware.

Diana and David prepared a special version of the system that DID definitely comply with the way ACBL insisted on having things (and did pretty well with it, as I recall).|

fp|t-title|at|3-level  and  4-level  Opening  Pre-empts|fp||at|^^
|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   3-level and 4-level Opening Pre-empts in Precision are no different than in any other system.

You are free to play your 4-level pre-empts as you like it.

My system uses 4@C and 4@D as "South African Texas", showing "good" 4-level pre-empts in Hearts and Spades respectively.  Also called Namyats (Stayman backwards).

We use 3@C as an intermediate opening.  Yes There is a "Complex" variant of my Precision system which has 2 and 3-level Openings that are TOTALLY different to what I've outlined today.

I'm not going to cover these today, but they will be dealt with briefly towards the end of the Series.

...or rather, after the end of the series, but on Thursday evenings any questions on what we've covered tonight?

ht|d|at|^^|
cp||at|^*bMM:^*n|cp||at|  We all know we have to alert when playing  'proper'  bridge.

The laws of the game say that what we have to put in the alert is  ^*b our agreement with partner ^*n about that bid.

While creating these bridge movies, I have gone through and added to, or amended, many of the alerts that were in the original text.

I have changed them from being ^*b REAL ^*n alerts, that you should give to real opponents, and have replaced them with ^*b STUDY ^*n alerts.   Study alerts are only useful to students of Oliver's Precision.  Of course in many cases no changes were needed.   For example    1@c     16+ Any dist except 16-23 4441

It is particularly important that we make the alerts for  ^*b Asking bids and their responses^*n,  as clear as possible

	    ^c ^*b Study Alert ^*n           ^i ^*b Real Alert ^*n                ^o ^*b It would be great if you could add ^*n
     ^b      @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@- ^h       @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-   ^n       @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-
		^c Beta    Relay Beta ...          ^i Gen Ctrl Ask                    ^o A = 2,  K = 1 
		^c Alpha                           ^i Asking  in                      ^o Trump ...
		^c Gamma                           ^i Asking  in partners suit        ^o Trump ...
		^c Epsilon                         ^i Specific Ctrl Ask               ^o in ... 
		^c Hxx                             ^i Hxx                             ^o in ... 
		^c none  or  1st & 2nd             ^i none  or  1st & 2nd             ^o [xxx, AKx(x)]
		^c 3rd rd ctrl                     ^i 3rd rd ctrl                     ^o [xx, Qxx(x), Qx]
		
An easy mistake in reply to an Epsilon is when, say, you hold ^*b Q76 ^*n in the suit, and so give only ^*b Qxx ^*n in the alert.   THAT  IS  WRONG.  The agreement is ^*b 3rd round control ^*n and that is what should be told to the opps.   

The ^*b ethical ^*n problem with telling too much to your opps is that it disadvantages the other pairs who will play your opponents cards.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
at|btour:  what is the logic again that the 3@H shows clubs short, please

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  So here East bids 3@H to show the @C shortage   (3@C would show a @D shortage, 3@D a @S shortage and 3@H a @C shortage, suit below the shortage on the wheel of suits).|
pg| ***** 133 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  This way we can always stop in 3@H if necessary.  That's the logic.

Here East decided to show the Club shortage rather than the Diamond SUIT,  with 4@D Personally, I'd have bid 4@D every time

Now West knows East has a maximum of 3 cards in the Black suits, so no losers there, and has Diamonds that can be ruffed in Dummy so a perfect fit. |
pg| ***** 134 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
at|kritter2:  If Eszter shows 4 diamonds ... what would John bid next? 

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Probably 4@S cue.  .. or even a direct 6@H

lute57:  but no need if able to recognize the hidden inference of only 3-cards in black suits remaining.
