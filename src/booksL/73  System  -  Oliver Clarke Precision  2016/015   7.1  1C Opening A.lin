cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Lots to cover tonight, so let's get started...

Hi Everyone and welcome to today's Precision Club session, in which we'll be taking a close look at the Precision 1@C Opening & Responses.

Over the previous sessions we've covered all the Intermediate (11-15) Openings, so now it's time to study what gives this System its name.

If you have not already done so, please have a look at the notes I have prepared on Precision Club bidding.

You can find these on:  ^*h http://bbo.pigpen.org.uk/^*n

The notes on 1@C Openings can be found at  ^*h http://bbo.pigpen.org.uk/1c.php^*n|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Okay, the 1@C Opening.

Over the past few weeks we've mostly looked at the intermediate Precision Openings: 1@D, 1@H, 1@S, 1NT, 2@C, and 2NT ...all of which show 11-15 points.

Yes, the 2NT Opener is a Multi but one of its options is 11-15.  We also looked at the Weak 2 openings, the Multi 2NT Opening and Pre-empts, which takes care of the 0-10 end of the spectrum.

Now we go to the opposite end: The 1@C Opening takes care of almost ANY hand which contains more 16 or more HCP.

The only exception (in this system) are hands in the 16-23 point range with any 4441 distribution.   These are opened with 2@D (which we'll cover later in the series).

Just as Precision has a big advantage over other systems where the intermediate openings are concerned.

There is much less pressure on partner to come up with a response knowing Opener is only 11-15.  

The 1@C Opening always being 16+ also helps us considerably, because Responder knows immediately that Opener has a strong hand.


The 1@C Opening shows 16+ points.

It says absolutely nothing about the Club suit and  ^*bMUST^*n  be alerted.

The opening is unconditionally FORCING for ONE round.

In the event of a 1@D Negative response, subsequent bidding is normally natural and non-forcing.

time for the first example|

at|  So here the 2@D is natural.

As West can see no real advantage in mentioning their very weak @H suit, and since they have some Diamond support but no controls, they just pass 2@D.

Any response other than 1@D is positive and game-forcing.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  If you have a nice 7-count or a poor 8-count and are in serious doubt about whether to  show a negative or a positive, bear one thing in mind: Game-forcing means just that.

It's not something that can be undone.

You can show a negative response and them jump to game or bid more strongly later on, but doing something like passing a bid from partner that is forcing destroys partnership confidence.

So if in serious doubt about showing a negative or a positive response, probably better to show a negative response and then bid more strongly later on.

Any questions thus far? 

ok


The 1@H, 1@S, 1NT, 2@C and 2@D responses are all positive responses showing 8+ points.

We show a 5-card Major before a 6-card or longer minor suit.

These responses are all game-forcing so although subsequent bidding is natural, it can be constructive with no need to jump to show extra strength.

Remember that  1@C  followed by a Positive Response makes the whole sequence game-forcing, so there is NO need for anyone to start leaping about with jump-shifts.

For example (if no Asking Bids are in use):    1@C - 1@H - 2@H 

The  1@H Response is game-forcing and  2@H  agrees Hearts as trumps, so now with a minimum Positive Responder might sign off in 4@H, but otherwise can start cue-bidding side-suit controls.|

at|  South might well take a chance on 7@H here, hoping not to find North with @Dxxx, but in practice will probably settle for 6@H.

So here, South only had to bid 2@H to agree Hearts and invite cue-bids So we start our slam exploration at the 2-level In most other systems, South would have to leap all over the place to create a forcing sequence.

We didn't need the space here, but sometimes it's crucial.|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   In the absence of immediate agreement of Responder's suit as trumps, bidding continues naturally (the sequence is GF, remember) until a suit is agreed or a sign-off in NT's is passed.

As above, Asking Bids change all that, since Opener will ALWAYS take charge of the auction (initially, at any rate).|

at|    Now West has to sign off in 6@S, as there is probably a @D loser, knowing the @H cue from East was a singleton or void.

Using Asking Bids we could get to the superior contract of 7@C, of course :) but it is almost impossible to do that without Asking Bids.

Any questions on the swap between 1@S and 1NT Responses?|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


bt||
nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  I often get asked why we don't simply play "transfer" positive responses to 1@C.

Jason Hackett and I tried this for a short while but found one significant drawback, which is that it "pushed" our Heart positive to  1@C - 2@D  (a pretty expensive response) and because we were often "hiding" our 5-card Minor suits (if the hand was semi-balanced), it was more important to keep the Major suit positives cheap.


Continuations over  1@C - 1@S  are mostly natural until we start using Asking Bids.

For example, if Opener is also balanced then the next move is often a rebid of  ^*b1NT^*n.   After that  2@C  Stayman is available to Responder.

Once Asking Bids are being used, however, a  ^*b1NT^*n  rebid by Opener becomes the Beta Asking Bid and Opener now controls the auction thereafter.

Before Asking Bids are being used the main effect of the swap of the  1@S  and  ^*b1NT^*n  Responses is to increase the number of times when Opener becomes Declarer so  -

^c1@C - 1NT - 2@S   agrees Spades and 

^c1@C - 1@S - 1NT   implies Opener is balanced or semi-balanced with no 5-card Major.

If opener is not balanced, then bidding proceeds naturally.

A Jump-Shift by Opener would show a largely solid  6+ card  suit and invite cue-bids, but the 1@S Response is Game-forcing, so strictly there is no need to jump-shift.|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |

bt||
nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Captaincy|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  The  1@C  Opener is by definition the Captain of the hand to start with, but can "hand over the Captaincy", normally by a bid of  1NT  or  2NT  eg:  

^c1@C - 1@S - 1NT

^c1@C - 2@C - 2NT

This normally shows a relatively minimum balanced hand, but may simply show no good support for partner's suit and be a "waiting bid" to give partner the chance to show any additional strength/features or a 2nd suit.

As we saw before, it might just be showing ANY range of balanced hand.

Handing over the Captaincy does not make the sequence non-GF.

After  1@C - 1@S (8+ BALANCED) then a  1NT  rebid by Opener is a convenient way of checking for 4-card fits, as normal practice would be for responder to use Stayman with at least one 4-card Major.

As we saw earlier, systemically, the 2NT bid is often specifically used as a way to "escape" from an Asking Bid sequence and revert to natural bidding.

We'll look at that in more detail when we start looking at Asking Bids.

Handing over the Captaincy doesn't have a huge amount of relevance UNTIL we are using Asking Bids.

Any questions on Captaincy?

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Given that  1@C - 1@D  is any 0-7,  1@C - 1@S  is a balanced positive  and  1@C - 1@H/1NT/2@C/2@D all show 5+-card suits, how do you show an 8+ responding hand that is not balanced, yet has no 5-card or longer suit (ie: 4441 positive hands)?

Positive 4441 hands are not catered for by the 1@H, 1@S, 1NT, 2@C and 2@D responses (they have no 5-card suit and are not balanced).

In the past we used something called the "Impossible Negative" for showing positive 4441 hands, but this part of the system was changed completely a few years ago.     Now...

^d@2 without Asking Bids  -  Opener @2can now set the suit (after which cue-bidding can ensue), bid NT's, or use Responder's singleton suit for RKCB.

1@C - 2NT - 3@C    and  
1@C - 2NT - 3@D   
^dan extra [first] step is inserted into the Eta responses to show that Opener has found Responder's singleton.

^*b(4)^*n ^c1@C - @23x      all show 12+ (unlimited) points and 4441 shape, in each case Responder bidding the suit BELOW their singleton (1@C-3@S showing a Club singleton).

Now bids in one of Responder's known 4-card suits are all Eta, and a bid of the singleton suit is Beta.

Again, when not using Asking Bids, bidding follows naturally, since Responder's exact shape is now known That's all simple enough (!!!).

^b@2The situation When Opps interfere, especially when they interfere immediately over the 1@C Opening, gets a LOT more complex, though, and we do not have the time go go into that today.

fp|t-title|at|Cambridge Heart Complex     showing a balanced hand opposite a  1@d  negative|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   So in the event of a NEGATIVE Response to 1@C, How does Opener show a strong balanced hand?

The answer is something my brother and I invented back in the 1970's called the Cambridge Heart Complex (we were at my brother's house in Cambridge when we developed it LOL).

The was this works is that after  1@C - 1@D,  1@H is a 2-way bid showing EITHER 5+ Hearts OR a strong balanced range.

The 1@H Rebid by Opener forces a 1@S Relay from Responder (there are exceptions which you can view on the website.  ^*bMM:^*n  Also covered in Graphical Summary  ^*gCamb,here^*n) and now ANY bid in NT's by Opener shows a strong balanced range and any OTHER bid confirms the Heart suit.      

For brevity,  CHC  =  Cambridge Heart Complex

The scheme for balanced hands is as follows:
^c@2
1@C - 1@D - 1NT ^L 16-18  balanced 

1@C - 1@D - 1@H(CHC) - 1@S(forced) - 1NT ^L 19-21  balanced
 
1@C - 1@D - 2NT ^L 22-23  balanced
 
1@C - 1@D - 1@H(CHC) - 1@S(forced) - 2NT ^L 24-25  balanced
 
1@C - 1@D - 3NT ^L 26-27  balanced 

1@C - 1@D - 1@H(CHC) - 1@S(forced) - 3NT ^L 28-29  balanced
^b@2
The great advantage of this method is that Opener ends up rebidding 1NT on hands with 20-21 points when people playing other systems will often be opening 2NT, so when Responder is very weak, we are a whole level of bidding lower.|

Opener just takes control at a low level without showing their hand-type, again saving bidding space.

Any questions on the Cambridge Heart Complex where it relates to showing strong balanced hands?|


bt||
nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   As I said before, there are certain hand-types where Responder breaks the 1@S forced relay.  

Those are fully explained on the website.            ^*bMM:^*n and ^*gCamb,here^*n


Once Opener rebids in NT's (whether the CHC used or not) developments are IDENTICAL to those over 1NT ie: 

^c4-suit transfers, ^j Stayman       ^o Texas Transfers at the 4-level,      
^cINTRO             ^j Transfer Leb  ^o NT raises at the next level via Stayman
^c2-way 2@D Response [over 1NT] ^j etc ...

Similarly over an eventual 2NT rebid by Opener, Responder has Puppet Stayman and Transfers available (So with 22+ semi-balanced with a 5-card Major, Opener can start off showing a balanced hand rather than showing their Major).

When Opener has 5+ Hearts they simply rebid naturally over the 1@S Relay.  Thus 

^c1@C - 1@D - 1@H(CHC) - 1@S(forced) - 2@C/2@D ^m shows a   Heart plus a Minor  2-suiter

^c1@C - 1@D - 1@H(CHC) - 1@S(forced) - 2@H ^m shows a   6+ Heart suit.

With a semi - balanced 5332 hand with Hearts (and less than 22 points), Opener will normally rebid their cheapest 3-card Minor.|
pg| ***** 110 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   After 1@C and a Positive Response in a suit, classic Precision uses continuations that are largely natural.

The advantage has been gained by creating a Game - Forcing sequence at a very low level, and this gives more room to explore for the right game or slam cheaply.

Thus after a sequence like  1@C - 1@H - 2@H,  the partnership can start cue-bidding at the 2-level if necessary.

This does not mean that no thought needs to be given to developments, however.

You can develop your own agreements whereby the Captain of the hand can ask about distributional features in responder's hand, for example.

Similarly, some pairs use positive responses that are mostly transfers to maximise the likelyhood of the 1@C Opener playing the hand.

Thus  1@C - 1@H  might show a Spade suit,  1@C - 1@S  might show 8+ balanced, etc.

Alternatively, other pairs simply swap the 1@S and 1NT bids round, so that  1@C - 1@S  shows a balanced positive and

1@C - 1NT  shows a Spade positive.

It is this last method that I suggest you start off with.

(I already covered why I dislike transfer positives).  Some pairs even develop methods that employ very low-level Ace-Asking in a way distinct from Asking Bids as such.

eg:  1@C - 1@S - 2@S   might agree Spades as trumps and asks for Aces.

These are all possibilities, but you are best developing your own style once you have mastered the basics.|

fp|t-title|at|Asking Bids   for the Future|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   My system relies heavily on the use of Asking Bids after a positive response.

We will start looking at those the week after next.


I am not going to cover Asking Bids today, since they take a number of months to deal with and form the second half of this course.

They add enormous power and more precision to slam exploration.

Like Blackwood, they are also great for keeping you OUT of poor slams!!!.


If anyone feels they have mastered basic Precision and feels they want to press on with more complex sequences, then you will find that the web site covers the Asking Bids in exhaustive detail, as do the downloadable System Notes.

The section on Asking Bids can be found at  ^*h http://www.bbo.pigpen.org.uk/AskingBids.php ^*n 

Please be aware, though, that the Asking Bids I use are quite heavily modified & expanded and that this is far from being a "basic" topic.

Please make sure that you are really comfortable with basic Precision bidding before you try to move on to Asking Bids.|

fp|t-title|at|Interference  over  1@C|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Next we will look briefly at what to do if opponents interfere over the 1@C Opening (which happens with considerable regularity <grin>).

If Opponents intervene immediately over the 1@C Opening, then responder's initial action is as follows: 
^c@2
Pass   ^h 0 - 4  hcp 
Double/Redouble ^h 5 - 7  hcp
any other bid ^h   8+   hcp           a positive GF response.
^b@2
So       1@C - (X) - 1@D     is a POSITIVE response in Diamonds.

If Opponents intervene at the level of   ^*b2@S or higher^*n   then this action is tweaked as follows: 

^cPass shows             ^h  0 - 7        ^j hcp
^cDouble is "positive"   ^h    8+         ^j hcp                with no "good" bid
^cSuit bids are positive ^h    8+         ^j hcp                     as normal

One upshot of this is that once Asking bids are in use, with a sequence like  1@C - (2@S) - X - ??,  because the Double is a "positive", the next bid by Opener is likely to be an Asking Bid.

Where you draw this line ...is entirely up to you.

Some pairs start using positive doubles over interference of 2@H, for example.  

The availability of a positive double does NOT, by the way, mean you have to double to show a positive response.  It merely implies that you have no "good" bid at the moment but need to show 8+ hcp.

There is a HUGE amount more to show you about interference, but we need to get the Asking Bids under our belts before we get to that stage, since that covers interference during the middle of an Asking Bid sequence or immediately over a Positive response to 1NT.|

ht|d|at|^^|
cp||at|^*bMM:^*n|cp||at|  We all know we have to alert when playing  'proper'  bridge.

The laws of the game say that what we have to put in the alert is  ^*b our agreement with partner ^*n about that bid.

While creating these bridge movies, I have gone through and added to, or amended, many of the alerts that were in the original text.

I have changed them from being ^*b REAL ^*n alerts, that you should give to real opponents, and have replaced them with ^*b STUDY ^*n alerts.   Study alerts are only useful to students of Oliver's Precision.  Of course in many cases no changes were needed.   For example    1@c     16+ Any dist except 16-23 4441

It is particularly important that we make the alerts for  ^*b Asking bids and their responses^*n,  as clear as possible

	    ^c ^*b Study Alert ^*n           ^i ^*b Real Alert ^*n                ^o ^*b It would be great if you could add ^*n
     ^b      @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@- ^h       @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-   ^n       @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-

		^c Alpha                           ^i Asking  in                      ^o Trump ...
		^c Gamma                           ^i Asking  in partners suit        ^o Trump ...
		^c Epsilon                         ^i Specific Ctrl Ask               ^o in ... 
		^c Hxx                             ^i Hxx                             ^o in ... 
		^c none  or  1st & 2nd             ^i none  or  1st & 2nd             ^o [xxx, AKx(x)]
		^c 3rd rd ctrl                     ^i 3rd rd ctrl                     ^o [xx, Qxx(x), Qx]
		
An easy mistake in reply to an Epsilon is when, say, you hold ^*b Q76 ^*n in the suit, and so give only ^*b Qxx ^*n in the alert.   THAT  IS  WRONG.  The agreement is ^*b 3rd round control ^*n and that is what should be told to the opps.   

The ^*b ethical ^*n problem with telling too much to your opps is that it disadvantages the other pairs who will play your opponents cards.|

at|    Here 1NT was showing 19 - 21 balanced                    2@D was 2 - way

East completed the transfer and now 4@H is showing 6+ @H        3@H would still be 6+ @H, but only invitational

This hand would probably better qualify for 4@D  Texas Transfer to 4@H.   No shape and the J@D arguably not worth much.  Ambitions to go further|
