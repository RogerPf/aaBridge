To recreate the table in your mind,  learn the pattern of the  ^*bControl^*n  column  (described above),  then:
  
When partner reports, for example  ^*b2nd^*n and ^*b3rd^*n,  you just, bring to mind the  |cp|r|at|^*bthree card^*n|cp||at|  sequence (ending with  '^*bx^*n')  that gives this level of control,  eg:   ^*bKQx^*n     this is always the value in the  |cp|h-highlight|at|middle|cp||at|  column.  

IF  you can remove any of the  '^*bx^*n's  and still have the same level of control (this time via ruffing),  eg:   ^*bKQ^*n    THEN  this is the value in the  |cp|h-highlight|at|second|cp||at|  column.

Starting from the previous value, remove an honour (replacing it with an  '^*bx^*n'  if need be) of course keeping the same level of control, eg:   ^*bQx^*n     this is always the value in the the  |cp|h-highlight|at|first|cp||at|  column.|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Hi Everyone and welcome to today's Precision Club session, in which the plan is that we'll be continuing our look at Precision Asking Bids.

Specifically, tonight we're going to look at Epsilon, which is the "lowest" Ask on our totem pole.

This is certainly not a "basic" topic and familiarity with the earlier material is essential.


If you have not already done so, please have a look at the notes I have prepared on Precision Club bidding.

You can find these on:  ^*h http://bbo.pigpen.org.uk ^*n  


You will DEFINITELY want to have these on screen in the background for reference during this session.  :) 


The notes on Epsilon can be found at  ^*h http://bbo.pigpen.org.uk/Epsilon.php ^*n


If you want download one of the Precision system documents on the site    eg:  Precision Teaching.pdf

fp|t-title|at|The  Epsilon  Ask|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  The Asking bid we're going to deal with today is called Epsilon.

Epsilon asks about the  SPECIFIC DEGREE OF CONTROL  that Responder holds in a SIDE suit.

It is only ever used AFTER trumps have definitely been agreed using an Asking Bid sequence, or when trumps have been definitely agreed in a natural sequence and a high-level Beta has been used.

If we don't know what trumps are, we can't ask about side suits.

Once trumps have been agreed using Asking Bids, however, then ANY bid in a SIDE-SUIT is, by definition, Epsilon, UNLESS it is Beta    (eg:  4@C  and  4@D  Beta takes precedence over 4@C and 4@D Epsilon), 

Or unless the Captain jump-shifts into a new suit (which is normally to play, as we discussed in a previous class).

So let me stress this:  ^*bEpsilon is not normally available UNLESS we've agreed trumps using Asking Bids^*n.

Even then, Beta takes precedence over Epsilon.

Once we have agreed trumps, though, Epsilon is pretty much the only Asking Bid available, except for repeat Trump Asks in the agreed suit, and Beta if required.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|    Take the following sequence:    

^c 1@C  -  1@H  -  1NT(Beta)  -   2@D(3 ctrls)   -   2@H(Gamma)  -  2NT(Hxxxx)  -  3@D...

^d here  3@D  is Epsilon in Diamonds.

Hearts have been firmly agreed by the use of Gamma, so 3@D is Epsilon rather than a trump asking bid.  Indeed, a sequence that ended  3@C  or  3@S  would ALSO be Epsilon Asks.    Contrast this with the following sequence: 

^c 1@C  -  1@H  -  1NT(Beta)  -  2@C(0-2 ctrls)  -  2@H(Gamma)  -  2NT(Hxxxx)  -  3@C...

^d here  3@C  is  ^*bNOT^*n Epsilon.

Instead it is the  Relay Beta  over the "positive" response to the  2@H  Gamma Ask.

Responder's exact level of controls is not yet known, so the Relay Beta takes precedence over Epsilon (General Controls are more important that suit-specific controls).

Lastly Now look at the following sequence: 

^c 1@C  -  1@S(bal)  -  2@C(Alpha)  -  2@H(Neg, 0-3)  -  2@S...       Here  2@S  is NOT Epsilon.

Since 2@H is a NEGATIVE response to the 2@C Alpha Ask, trumps have not yet been agreed.

2@S is, therefore, the trump Asking bid Iota (which we'll come to in a couple of weeks).


Any questions thus far on when a bid CAN and CANNOT be Epsilon?

Alright, let's move on...|

nt|^z@3^b@2|
ht|a|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  As I said above, Epsilon asks about the specific DEGREE of control held in a side-suit and is just as interested in shortages as in honours.

With Epsilon we are interested  in: ^j    3rd ^k    round control   (Doubleton  or  Queen), 
                                    ^j    2nd ^k    round control   (Singleton   or  King)
                                    ^j    1st ^k    round control   (Void          or    Ace)      ^*bAND^*n     all combinations.
^b@24th round control counts as  ^*bNo^*n control.


|fp|b-bigTitle|at|Epsilon  First  Response^*n|fp||at|    ^k    |cp|u|at|(shortage)|cp||at|

^c 2                        ^g 3rd              ^l   xx          ^n   Qxx ^o    (x) ^q   Qx        ^t     2
^c 3                        ^g 2nd              ^l   x           ^n   Kxx ^o    (x) ^q   K         ^t     3
^c 4                        ^g 2nd + 3rd        ^l   Kx          ^n   KQx ^o    (x) ^q   KQ        ^t     4
^c 5                        ^g 1st              ^l    -          ^n   Axx ^o    (x) ^q             ^t     5
^c 6                        ^g 1st  + 3rd       ^l   Ax          ^n   AQx ^o    (x) ^q   AQ        ^t     6
^c 7                        ^g 1st  + 2nd + 3rd ^l   AK          ^n   AKQ ^o    (x) ^q             ^t     7

Except for the doubling up of  1st + 2nd round control  with  None (^*bNo^*n control),  it is an entirely logical and progressive sequence.

We double up on  0 / 1+2  to save space and because it is normally possible for the asker to know immediately which of those two it is.

Where there are alternatives above, the first shows  MIN LENGTH  (shortage), the second an  EXTRA HONOUR, and the third shows  BOTH   Min Length (shortage)  AND  the Extra Honour.

The importance of this will become apparent in a minute.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|
ht|a|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  So take   3rd round control  (2 Steps)  as an example,  the entry reads     ^*bxx     Qxx     Qx^*n
 
The 3rd rd ctrl will be one of   ^*bxx^*n   a shortage,    ^*bQxx^*n   an honour  and      ^*bQx^*n    both a shortage AND an honour.

But bear in mind that a singleton Queen counts as a SECOND round control as would, for example, a singleton Two.  

Eg:

^c1@C  -  1NT(@s's)  -  2@S(Gamma)  -  3@C(5-card, 1 Top H)  -  3@H(Epsilon in @H's)  -  4@C  shows  2nd  rd ctrl.

And

^c1@C  -  1@H  -  1@S(Alpha)  -  2@S(Good Sup + 4 ctrls)  -  3@C(Epsilon)  -  3@D  is  1st + 2nd  ^*bOR^*n  No control  of Clubs.


It is worth stressing at this stage that (4 steps)   ^*bKx^*n   is   2nd + 3rd   round control, not just  2nd  round control.

Similarly (6 steps)   ^*bAx^*n   is    1st + 3rd    rather than just   1st.

Showing those two holdings as    only "2nd"    and as   only "1st"    are two of the more common mistakes by those getting used to Epsilon.



Any questions on the stepped responses to Epsilon and the different kinds of holding each stepped response can show?|

In practice, Zeta probably wouldn't be my favourite choice of route here since we NEED  @S 3-3,  OR  for East to have help in Clubs or a ruffing value there.|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|     We've not had the space to find out much about East's hand.
^^One disadvantage of using Zeta is that we can NEVER find out what partner's trump holding is (except perhaps by a process of elimination with multiple Epsilons) but on this hand I suspect West will ALWAYS be struggling for the space to agree Diamonds as trumps by any other means, AND to ascertain East's Club holding with any certainty.
^^Any questions?|

pg| ***** 63 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|
ht|a|at|^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  If we START asking in @D ANY response South makes will take us past 4@H, so our next will have to be 5@H

However, if we ask about @H first, this has two advantages.   Firstly, if South doesn't have the K@H, their response will likely be 1 or 2 steps only, which means our next ask can be 5@D (one bid CHEAPER, not more expensive).  

Secondly, we don't really WANT partner to have the  King of @H's.|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  We'd much rather they had the DIAMOND king because that fits better with out hand.
^^So if South SHOWS the @H king, that more expensive response will be something of a warning to us, especially if they have something like  Kx  (generating a 4-step Epsilon response),  which will mean that we (North) can't ask about @D with 5@D's.|

However, the ONLY Grand Slam we can make is 7@D,   everyone follow?    7@S can't make here.

^*bkritter2:^*n(Shirl)   Declarer has to have spades to discard losers because the @C ruff is in the hand with the longer trumps, so the Club ruff gains us nothing.|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Exactly Shirl,  whereas in 7@D, we can ruff the Club in the South hand and still have a long trump in the north hand, giving us our 13th trick, and the losing @H goes on the long spade  

^*bRedbird44:^*n   Oliver I see that you will know this from the bidding.   Not sure i would recoginze it myself.

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Let me change the hand a little in your imagination: 

Suppose South did NOT have the Jack of @d's, but a small one.   Now his response to the repeat Epsilon would be 7@C How to play in 7@D NOW?

For most purposes a 3rd bid in an Epsilon suit is always "TO PLAY".|

nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Let me just repeat the stuff about repeat Epsilons:     Just when you thought it was safe to uncover your ears, let me tell you that you can have REPEAT Epsilons.


The stepped responses to a repeat Epsilon are: 
^c@2
1    step     ^f SHORTAGE  (Min Length)   ^l    -,  x,  xx,  Kx,  Ax 
2    steps    ^f HONOUR                   ^l    Qxx,  Kxx,  Axx,  KQx,  AQx
3    steps    ^f BOTH                     ^l    Qx,  K,  AQ,  A
4    steps    ^f Suit (4+)  NO  Jack      ^l    Qxxx(x),  Kxxx(x),  Axxx(x)
5    steps    ^f Suit (4+)    +   Jack    ^l    QJxx(x),  KJxx(x),  AJxx(x)
^b@2

An exception is where the first Epsilon response showed   No Control   OR  1st AND 2nd,  in which case it is  
^c@2
1   step      ^f No Control,^i  
2   steps     ^f Stiff Ace  ^i (shortage - min length), 
3   steps     ^f AKx        ^i (honour)
4   steps     ^f AKxx(x)    ^i (Suit minus the Jack)
5   steps     ^f AKJx(x)    ^i (Suit with the Jack)
^b@2
So you cannot have  1st & 2nd  round control and "both"  min length  and an  extra honour.    As an Example - 

^c 1@C  -  1@S  -  1NT(Beta)  -  2@D  -  2@S(Gamma)  -  3@D  -  3@H(Epsilon)  -  3NT(3rd)  -  4@H(Rep)  -  ???

^d 4@S ^f shows ^i a small doubleton in Spades (xx).
^d 4NT ^f shows ^i Qxx, 
^d 5@C ^f shows ^i the doubleton Queen, 
^d 5@D ^f shows ^i Qxxx(x) 
^d 5@H ^f shows ^i QJxx(x)|
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


bt||
nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Worth noting also that the repeat ask doesn't have to follow IMMEDIATELY on from the first Epsilon ask.

^d 1@C                 ^i -      1@H 
^d 1NT(Beta)           ^i -      2@D 
^d 2@H(Gamma)          ^i -      2NT 
^d 3@D(Epsilon)        ^i -      3@S(3rd) 
^d 4@C(Epsilon)        ^i -      5@C(1st) 
^d 5@D(Repeat Epsilon) ^i -      5@H(@Hxx)...

I would expect that you're reeling a bit by now.

There is provision for an Epsilon Ask in the Singleton Suit when a 4441 hand has been shown by responder.

I'm not going to cover that here and now, but it is covered in the Notes on the website.      (^*bMM:^*n And in first section)

The responses distinguish between small and honour singletons.

So there you have Epsilon.

The main thing to remember about Epsilon is that it is NEVER available UNLESS and UNTIL we've agreed a trump suit using Asking Bids, or UNTIL we've agreed trumps naturally AND used a High-level Beta (by the strong hand).

Similarly, Once those conditions HAVE been satisfied, Epsilon is the ONLY Asking bid still in the game except for repeat asks in the trump suit or Relay/High Beta is that's still required.

Lastly, Epsilon is the "lowest" Asking Bid in the pecking order, so remember that 4@C/4@D Beta and Relay Beta ALWAYS take precedence over Epsilon (General controls more important than specific Controls).|

ht|d|at|^^|
cp||at|^*bMM:^*n|cp||at|  We all know we have to alert when playing  'proper'  bridge.

The laws of the game say that what we have to put in the alert is  ^*b our agreement with partner ^*n about that bid.

While creating these bridge movies, I have gone through and added to, or amended, many of the alerts that were in the original text.

I have changed them from being ^*b REAL ^*n alerts, that you should give to real opponents, and have replaced them with ^*b STUDY ^*n alerts.   Study alerts are only useful to students of Oliver's Precision.  Of course in many cases no changes were needed.   For example    1@c     16+ Any dist except 16-23 4441

It is particularly important that we make the alerts for  ^*b Asking bids and their responses^*n,  as clear as possible

	    ^c ^*b Study Alert ^*n           ^i ^*b Real Alert ^*n                ^o ^*b It would be great if you could add ^*n
     ^b      @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@- ^h       @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-   ^n       @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-
		^c Beta    Relay Beta ...          ^i Gen Ctrl Ask                    ^o A = 2,  K = 1 
		^c Alpha                           ^i Asking  in                      ^o Trump ...
		^c Gamma                           ^i Asking  in partners suit        ^o Trump ...
		^c Epsilon                         ^i Specific Ctrl Ask               ^o in ... 
		^c Hxx                             ^i Hxx                             ^o in ... 
		^c none  or  1st & 2nd             ^i none  or  1st & 2nd             ^o [xxx, AKx(x)]
		^c 3rd rd ctrl                     ^i 3rd rd ctrl                     ^o [xx, Qxx(x), Qx]
		
An easy mistake in reply to an Epsilon is when, say, you hold ^*b Q76 ^*n in the suit, and so give only ^*b Qxx ^*n in the alert.   THAT  IS  WRONG.  The agreement is ^*b 3rd round control ^*n and that is what should be told to the opps.   

The ^*b ethical ^*n problem with telling too much to your opps is that it disadvantages the other pairs who will play your opponents cards.|

cp|red|at|^*bOliver:^*n|cp||at|    One point I was going to make earlier is that when you KNOW there's a @D fit, and you can agree @D cheaply, better to do so, that go looking for a second fit in a major.

Okay, we're definitely going to leave it there for tonight. 


I apologise for giving you all headaches 4 weeks on the trot. 

All I can say is that next week WILL be a lot easier. ^o ^*bMM:^*n   He said that last week,  he realy did.   :)



Please do check out the notes on the website.  The  PrecisionTeaching.doc  and PrecisionTeaching.pdf files that can be downloaded are the full description of what I teach on BBO. 

These notes cover the Asking Bids in considerably more detail  than I've been able to do today.
