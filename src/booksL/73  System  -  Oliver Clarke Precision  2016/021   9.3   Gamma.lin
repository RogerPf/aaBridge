cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Hi Everyone and welcome to today's Precision Club session, in which the plan is that we'll be continuing our look at Precision Asking Bids with a look at Gamma, an Asking Bid that asks about RESPONDER's 5-card or longer suit (normally 5-card or longer, anyway).

Once again, this is certainly not a "basic" topic.

If you're not completely familiar with "basic Precision Openings and responses, then this will be a very difficult session for you to follow to get anything from.

The same applies if you were not here for the last few weeks' sessions.

If you have not already done so, please have a look at the notes I have prepared on Precision Club bidding.

You can find these on:  ^*hhttp://bbo.pigpen.org.uk^*n

You will DEFINITELY want to have these onscreen in the background for reference during this session <grin>.

The notes on Gamma are at  ^*hhttp://bbo.pigpen.org.uk/Gamma.php^*n  

If you are new to Asking Bids then there's no way you're going to absorb everything we cover tonight, so please do visit the site and read through the Asking Bid section at your leisure.

If you want download one of the Precision system documents on the site  "PrecisionTeaching.doc"  or the pdf.

They are fairly large (around 500k) but cover this stuff in more detail. ^*h http://bbo.pigpen.org.uk/Documents.php ^*n|

nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|The Gamma  Ask|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   The rule of thumb here is that in  ^*bANY^*n  Asking Bid Sequence where we've not yet agreed a suit as trumps,  then ^*b ANY^*n  Ask in Responder's suit is Gamma.

The only time this is NOT true is when Responder is KNOWN to have EXACTLY a 4-card suit, in which case the Asking Bid is Eta rather than Gamma (but, as we'll see tonight, Eta is a "length-known" Gamma in any case).

If another suit HAS been agreed as trumps already, then an Ask in Responder's suit is generally Epsilon, asking about the specific level of control held in that suit, but it can be Beta (4@C or 4@D).

If another suit has been agreed as trumps, a bid of Responder's suit can NEVER be Gamma.

This system allows for Gamma over weak  2@H and  2@S Openings,  but here it is not a bid of Opener's Major that is Gamma but other specific bids, viz:    2@H - 3@C   and   2@S - 3@D   are Gamma  (in Hearts and Spades respectively).  

There are also other specific sequences where a bid is Gamma (eg: after  2@D  Openings and  2NT  Openings).

You can look these up at your leisure.

Looking at the first of those (briefly):

^c 2@D - 2NT(14+ Majors) - 3@H   is showing a Spade singleton and is Gamma in Hearts (4-card minimum length)

Worth noting that although Responder might only be 4-card, the ask is Gamma rather than Eta, because they might have ANY length in the suit On the other hand: 

^c 2@D - 2NT(14+ Majors) - 3@C(@D singleton) - 3@H   is Eta rather than Gamma, because Opener is KNOWN to

be 4441 shape.    Hopefully that will make sense to some of you :)|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|When  is  it  Gamma ?|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|    This system also allows for Gamma in Forcing No Trump sequences, by omitting the long-weak-suit type response   (eg: 1@S - 1NT - 2@C - 2@H)   altogether.

Instead a relay in the cheapest new suit over Opener's rebid is Gamma in their opening Major, and a relay in the 2nd-cheapest new suit is Gamma in their second suit if they have shown one.   So

^c 1@S - 1NT - 2@D - 2@H    is Gamma in Spades, and 

^c 1@S - 1NT - 2@H - 3@D    is Gamma in Hearts.

I would REALLY suggest that you give this method a try once you've got to grips with Gamma, because it is far more useful than the "long - weak suit" variety and really gives your slam bidding over 1@H and 1@S Openers an razor-sharp edge.

Thus the following bids are all Gamma: 
^c @2
1@C  -  1@H  -  2@H(Gamma)
      
1@C  -  2@C(Positive with @C's)   -   2@D(Beta)    -  2NT(4 controls)      -    3@C(Gamma)
      
1@C  -  1@H(Pos with @H's)          -   1@S(Alpha)  -  2@C(No Support, 4+ Controls)  -  2@H(Gamma)
      
1@H  -  1NT  -  3@C  -  3@D    is Gamma in Spades and 
      
1@S  -  1NT  -  3@C  -  3@H    is Gamma in Clubs.
^b@2
In each case where 1@C is opened and Responder shows a Suit positive, no other suit has been agreed as trumps, and Opener simply bids Responder's suit.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|    In the FNT sequences, Responder relays in a new suit over Opener's rebid and that is Gamma.

In other situations these are simply specific sequences where a bid is Gamma.

Any questions on WHEN a bid is Gamma? 
^^^^^^^^
|fp|t-title|at|Gamma  Agrees  Trumps|fp||at|^^^^|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|    Gamma asks solely about the length and quality of Responder's suit.

The mere USE of Gamma (or Eta for that matter) agrees the suit for the purposes of Asking Bids.

The Asker has ways to back out of the agreement, but if those are not used, then the suit is agreed as trumps for the purposes of subsequent Asks.

There are two main ranges, depending on whether the exact length of responder's suit is known or not.

In this version of the system, however, the  "length known"  scale is only found over 2NT Openings (unless you agree to play length-known Gamma over weak 2's or unless the bid is an Eta Ask which, as I said above, is effectively a length-known Gamma).

The different scales are simply known as "length unknown" (the normal one) and "length-known", which occurs only occasionally.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Length  Unknown  Scale    (normal)|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   The first range is used where Resp's exact length is not known:
^c@2 
1   step   shows ^g  0  ^h    Top Honours ^L(^*bAny^*n length) 
2   steps  shows ^g  1  ^h    Top Honour  ^L(min len) 
3   steps  shows ^g 2-3 ^h    Top Honours ^L(min len) 
4   steps  shows ^g  1  ^h    Top Honour  ^L(min len ^*b+ 1^*n) 
5   steps  shows ^g  2  ^h    Top Honours ^L(min len ^*b+ 1^*n) 
6   steps  shows ^g  3  ^h    Top Honours ^L(min len ^*b+ 1^*n) 
7   steps  shows ^g  1  ^h    Top Honour  ^L(min len ^*b+ 2^*n),
... (repeating)
^b@2
I think the record for Gamma currently stands at a 13 - step response So after a positive response in a suit over a 1@C Opening the minimum length is 5.

After a 2@H or 2@S semi - positive opening, the minimum length is 6.

In sequences such as 2@D - 2NT, however, the minimum length would be 4 if Opener ends up asking about one of Responder's suits.

You may, of course agree that weak 2's are ALWAYS a 6-card suit, in which case you will be using the "length known" scale So 1@C - 1@H - 2@H(Gamma) - 3@C shows a 5-card suit with 2 or all 3 of the top honours.

1@C - 2@D - 2@H(Beta) - 2NT(3 controls) - 3@D(Gamma) - 4@D shows a 6-card suit with 2 of the top 3 honours.

Time for an example|

pg| ***** 16 ***** |


bt||
nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  It doesn't matter WHAT the minimum possible length of the suit is in a given circumstance, the structure of the first three steps remains:
^c@2
1. ANY length            No   Top Honour

2. Minimum length      1     Top Honour

3. Minimum length,    2-3   Top Honours
^b@2
So 

^c 1@H - 1NT - 3@H - 3@S   is Gamma in Hearts with a 6-card minimum length. 

Now  4@D  shows 6-card length exactly with 2 or 3 top honours in Hearts. 

This is because after   1@H - 1NT - 3@H    the "minimum length" is now 6,  given the jump rebid in  @H  by Opener.


Everyone follow?
 
Anyone struggling?|

fp|t-title|at|Length  Known  Scale|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  The other scale is used when responder's length IS known: 
^c@2
1   Step  shows ^g  0 ^h Top Honour 
2   Steps shows ^g  1 ^h Top Honour 
3   Steps shows ^g  1 ^h Top Honour    AND the Jack 
4   Steps shows ^g  2 ^h Top Honours 
5   Steps shows ^g  2 ^h Top Honours  AND the Jack 
6   Steps shows ^gall 3^h Top Honours
^b@2            ^g
This scale is NOT open-ended, and does allow partner to show or deny the Jack.  Thus, in practice, the responses to a "Length Known" Gamma are indistinguishable from those for Eta.

The difference (immaterial, really) is that we call it Eta when the suit is KNOWN to be 4-card length and Gamma when it's KNOWN to be exactly 5 or 6-card length.

There are no situations where we can have a suit that's "known" to be 7+-card in length.  Thus 

^c 2NT(Multi) - 4@C(GF) - 4@D(Majors) - 4NT is Gamma in Hearts using the length-Known scale, 

since Opener is KNOWN to be exactly 5 - 5 in the Majors (not allowed to be 5-4 or 6-5, MUST be exactly 5-5).  So

^c 2@D - 2NT(14+ both Majors) - 3@C(@D singleton) - 3@H is Eta in Hearts   but 

^c 2@D - 2NT(14+ both Majors) - 3@H      is a length-unknown Gamma with a 4-card minimum length, since

Responder might have 5-card or longer Hearts. |

fp|t-title|at|Repeat  Gamma Asks|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Let's deal with REPEAT GAMMA Asks.  A repeat Gamma is normally available BELOW game level to clarify responder's exact holding: If Responder has shown NO top honours, then they simply show additional length with extra steps, Thus: 
^c@2
1  step     shows minimum length 
2  steps   shows minimum length  ^*b+ 1^*n
3  ...

^bIf Responder has shown  ONE  top honour, then: 

1  step     shows   ^g Q   ^hor   KJ 
2  steps   shows    ^g K   ^hor   AJ
3  steps   shows    ^g A   ^hor   QJ
^b@2
(think of the sequence as a circular one and it's easy enough to remember)

If Responder has shown  TWO  top honours, then:
^c@2 
1  step  shows ^gKQ  ^hor   AKJ 
2  steps shows ^gAQ  ^hor   KQJ
3  steps shows ^gAK  ^hor   AQJ
^b@2
(Again this is circular if you analyse it) With both of the above.   If Responder has already shown or denied the Jack (ie: a length-known Gamma), then he simply shows which Top Honour (or combination) they hold (ie: the first of the two alternatives above).

If Responder has shown all 3 top honours, then the (VERY rare) repeat relates solely to possession of the Jack (1 step denies, 2 steps promises).

So nothing else needs to be asked at this point.   Does everyone see how there is no need to ask about the @D?

We know that South has 3 controls and we know that one is the K@S (the Repeat Gamma Response) then then other two must be the  A@d.        South cannot possibly have the K@H as that would leave an impossible 'missing' control. |

fp|t-title|at|Forcing-No-Trump  Gamma  sequences|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  In the Forcing-No-Trump Gamma sequences, if Opener rebids  2@C  or  2@D  over the 1NT Response, this MIGHT be only a 3-card suit.

If Responder subsequently uses a relay in the second-cheapest new suit to make a Gamma ask in the Minor, this uses a 1-off special Scale for Gamma: Now the 
^c@2
1  step   shows any 3-card holding (and a further Relay asks again with Length known Gamma Responses).
2  steps starts a normal "length unknown" Gamma scale with 4-cards as the minimum length.  So
^b@2
In these circumstances the suit is NOT considered agreed when Opener shows a 3-card holding UNLESS Responder makes the second Relay.
^c@2
1@S - 1NT - 2@C(might be 3-card) - 2@H(Gamma in Clubs) - 2@S(3-card @C) - 3NT    is natural and "to play", whilst
  
1@S - 1NT - 2@C(might be 3-card) - 2@H(Gamma in Clubs) - 2@S(3-card @C) - 3@C      is now a length-known Gamma
^n (3-card length known), and Clubs are agreed as trumps.

1@S - 1NT - 2@C  -  2@H  -  2NT   shows 4+-card Clubs, but no top honour 

1@S - 1NT - 2@C  -  2@H  -  3@C    shows Hxxx in Clubs 

1@S - 1NT - 2@C  -  2@H  -  3@D    shows HHxx  or  HHHx in Clubs etc, as per the "length unknown" Gamma scale

^bSimilarly 

1@S - 1NT - 2@D(might be 3-card)  -  3@C(Gamma in @D)  -  4@C  is showing a 5-card Diamond suit with ONE top

^h@2honour in the suit (3@D shows 3-card length and 4-card min length thereafter, so the 4-step response shows min length +1 and one TH).|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


bt||
nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Gamma  first  at  times|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  When responder makes a positive in a suit and you have a good tolerance (Hx or better) for their suit it will normally be good tactics to use Gamma in their suit, especially if you are very strong or their response to a low Beta suggests a possible slam.

You can always use Epsilon to ascertain their holding in YOUR suit and jump - shift into it later to cancel out the suit - agreement which the use of Gamma automatically generates.

The nice thing about Gamma is that its use AUTOMATICALLY agrees the suit as trumps, which means you are almost guaranteed a relatively cheap sequence thereafter Over ANY use of Gamma.

When partner's exact controls are not yet known a Relay over the response (not in trumps) is the Relay Beta (except when partner has shown a 3-card holding in a Forcing No Trump sequence).

When you are intending to use Gamma it's sometimes best to make a low-level Beta FIRST.

This will usually save space but, especially when Responder is a passed hand and even the special weak-scale Beta might be expensive you can, as an alternative, use Gamma first and then a Relay Beta immediately over the Gamma Response.  Thus
^c@2
pass  -  1@C  -  2@C  -  (2@S overcall)  -  ??? 

^bso here

^*bDouble^*n  ^e would be Alpha in @H
 
^*bPass^*n   ^e would be Alpha in @D
 
^*b3@C^*n  ^e would be Gamma but the response will be expensive.  So  3@C  Gamma over 2@C (and the overcall)
                              ^s then a  Relay Beta,  is better.|

fp|t-title|at|Practice / Demo  Hands|fp||at|^^^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  As I said earlier, the mere use of Gamma automatically agrees the suit as trumps for the purposes of the Asking Bid sequence.

If, however, partner shows no Top Honours or only 1 top honour and MINIMUM length (ie: a 1 or 2 - step response), then an immediate bid in NT's normally cancels out that trump agreement and is "to play"  OR  is handing over the Captaincy, depending on the circumstances.

As I said before, please do not worry if you can't recall the ranges in detail.

Have a read through the notes on the Website and perhaps print them out.

Gradually they will make sense and settle down in your memory.

Any questions on Gamma???            You've all been suspiciously quiet :)

ht|d|at|^^|
cp||at|^*bMM:^*n|cp||at|  We all know we have to alert when playing  'proper'  bridge.

The laws of the game say that what we have to put in the alert is  ^*b our agreement with partner ^*n about that bid.

While creating these bridge movies, I have gone through and added to, or amended, many of the alerts that were in the original text.

I have changed them from being ^*b REAL ^*n alerts, that you should give to real opponents, and have replaced them with ^*b STUDY ^*n alerts.   Study alerts are only useful to students of Oliver's Precision.  Of course in many cases no changes were needed.   For example    1@c     16+ Any dist except 16-23 4441

It is particularly important that we make the alerts for  ^*b Asking bids and their responses^*n,  as clear as possible

	    ^c ^*b Study Alert ^*n           ^i ^*b Real Alert ^*n                ^o ^*b It would be great if you could add ^*n
     ^b      @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@- ^h       @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-   ^n       @-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-@-
		^c Beta    Relay Beta ...          ^i Gen Ctrl Ask                    ^o A = 2,  K = 1 
		^c Alpha                           ^i Asking  in                      ^o Trump ...
		^c Gamma                           ^i Asking  in partners suit        ^o Trump ...
		^c Epsilon                         ^i Specific Ctrl Ask               ^o in ... 
		^c Hxx                             ^i Hxx                             ^o in ... 
		^c none  or  1st & 2nd             ^i none  or  1st & 2nd             ^o [xxx, AKx(x)]
		^c 3rd rd ctrl                     ^i 3rd rd ctrl                     ^o [xx, Qxx(x), Qx]
		
An easy mistake in reply to an Epsilon is when, say, you hold ^*b Q76 ^*n in the suit, and so give only ^*b Qxx ^*n in the alert.   THAT  IS  WRONG.  The agreement is ^*b 3rd round control ^*n and that is what should be told to the opps.   

The ^*b ethical ^*n problem with telling too much to your opps is that it disadvantages the other pairs who will play your opponents cards.|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Nicely done, you two.   Needs 2 @C ruffs in the East hand  BUT  on a trump lead, you need get the @H's right.
^^Hopefully that hand has served to emphasis why it is often best to use Gamma in partner's suit FIRST, with or without a low Beta, rather than Alpha in YOUR suit first.

I mentioned the order of the Epsilons before.   If you think ahead about possibly needing to ask in BOTH red suits...|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Asking in @H FIRST, will almost certainly allow a 5@D Epsilon Ask, but if you ask in @D first, your second Epsilon will be 1 step higher.     It's only 1 step difference, but that step can be crucial at times.   Suppose West had

^c @SQxxxxx   @Hxxx  @DKx  @CAx

Now the hands are not fitting as well.  You might have 2 @H losers.|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  But, as I said, it doesn't matter here, since a  5@S  response to a  5@H  Epsilon would still allow you to stop 

low if you didn't fancy it, so it doesn't matter on this particular hand.

Any questions or comments?|

at|^^^^Remember that since West is 14+, we treat them as 16+ for the purposes of Relay Beta, so the STRONG scale is used here.

The upshot of this is that if you have a very "quacky" 14+, perhaps better to treat it as a 2@H response rather than 2NT.|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  So we know about the @SAQ and now the 6@C response means that West should have the two red suit
^^Kings in addition, but in practice it's enough to know they have @DKx or KQx.
^^East can't afford to ask in @H, and since West cannot have the A@H, it's not worth it even if you could ask.|

cp|red|at|^*bOliver:^*n|cp||at|  Okay, we're going to leave it there for tonight. I apologise for giving you all headaches 2 weeks on the trot. 

All I can say is that next week WILL be a lot easier.

Please do check out the notes on the website. The Precision.doc and Presicion.pdf files  that can be downloaded and are the System description of what I play with one of my Precision partners.   

These notes cover the Asking Bids in considerably more detail than I've been able to do today.

Next week we'll be having a look at Epsilon, the suit-specific control asking bid we use once trumps have been agreed.

The notes on the website cover will cover these, so please try to have a look at them before next week.


Eszter5: thanks Oliver
