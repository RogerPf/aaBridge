cp|red|at|^*bOliver:^*n|cp||at|     Hi Everyone and welcome to today's session, in which we're going to take a brief look at defensive carding techniques rather than anything to do with bidding.  |cp|red|at|^*bFirst some NEWS^*N|cp||at|

John Lutes  EXCELENT  book on  ^*bOCP ^*n(Vol 1)   is now published and available from  Amazon (.com AND .uk)

|n^|0|at|
Today we're going to take a quick look at four very specific areas where I think most players can sharpen up their act somewhat: 
|lg|k|n^|9|at|^c@2
1.   Honour Leads, Strong Tens and Coded 9's & 10's 
2.   Attitude or Count? 
3.   Odd/Even (Roman) signals and discards 
4.   Giving COUNT accurately when it matters
|lg|8|n^|1|at|^b@2
The website does have some notes that cover some of tonight's topic.

You can find these on: ^*h http://bbo.pigpen.org.uk/index.php ^*n 

The section on Carding can be accessed from there ^*h http://bbo.pigpen.org.uk/Carding.php ^*n 

It doesn't cover everything I'm dealing with tonight but there are some notes on "strong tens" and odd/even carding.
|n#|8|at|
Ok, let's make a start: |

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|     I'm sure most of you, like me, were brought up on the idea of leading the higher of 2 touching honours, 4th highest and either "Top of Nothing", MUD or "perhaps even lowest from 3 small".
|n^|3|at|
Nothing wrong with that but there are some circumstances where the first of those doesn't always get you the right result.
|n^|3|at|
Suppose you hold the following hand:
|n^|9|at| 
^d@2@s Axx 
@h Jxx 
@d K8xxx 
@c xx 
|n^|9|at|^b@2
The bidding goes 1NT on your left and 3NT on your right ends the bidding.

Partner leads the @dJ.    Dummy goes down with: 
|n^|9|at|^d@2
@s Kxx 
@h Qxx 
@d x 
@c KQ10xxx 
|n^|9|at|^b@2
The question is do you go up with the King of Diamonds at trick 1 or not? 
|n^|7|at|
If partner has led the Jack from  J10x  then there is no future in covering with the King and you're best to duck otherwise you may end up promoting an additional trick for declarer in the suit.
|n^|7|at|
If, however partner has led the Jack from  AJ10x  then it could be vitally important that you rise with the King and return a second Diamond to capture declarer's Queen and claim your 6 tricks before declarer runs another 8 tricks in Clubs and Hearts.
|n^|7|at|
Everyone with me thus far?|

lg|c|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|     The idea of  'Strong Tens'  is this:  ^p(normally played against NT contracts) 
|n^|5|at|
^b   @.^cThe lead of the  ^*b Jack  ^*n categorically  DENIES  having ^*b ANY ^*n higher honour.
|n^|9|at|
^b   @.^cTh@2e lead of the   ^*b 10  ^*n(unless High/Low from 10x or from a singleton)  GUARANTEES 
possession of the   9 OR Jack   AS WELL AS   the 10 
AND at least one non-touching honour HIGHER than the Jack  (in what is known as an interior sequence).
|n^|5|at|^d@2
^b       This means:  Lead the 
|n^|9|at|
      9  ^ffrom     10^*u9^*nx
    10   ^ffrom     Q^*u10^*n9   K^*u10^*n9   A^*u10^*n9   KJ^*u10^*n   AJ^*u10^*n    and perhaps even from     AK^*u10^*n9 
  Jack   ^ffrom     ^*uJ^*n10x
|n^|5|at|
^b@2Using these methods partner is NEVER in doubt as to whether to rise with their honour or not, depending on what they can see in Dummy and their own hand.

The sharper amongst you may have noticed that I left out  KQ109  in that list.  There's a good reason for that.

Especially against NT's, lead the QUEEN from  KQ109(x)  rather than the King or the 10.  

Leading the Queen specifically asks partner to UNBLOCK the Jack if they have it.   If you lead the 10 and they can see the Queen in Dummy and they have the Ace or the King, they KNOW to let the Jack ride if Dummy doesn't cover.

If, on the other hand, Dummy has nothing in the suit and they have the Ace or King, they KNOW to rise with their honor in the knowledge that Declarer has the Queen and you have the other remaining honour higher than the Queen.

lg|c|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|     Very similar, but subtly different are "Coded 9's and 10's".    ^r(normally played against NT contracts) 

^b   @.^cAs with 'strong 10s',  the ^*b Jack ^*n  categorically  DENIES  having ^*b ANY ^*n higher honour.
|n^|9|at|
^b   @.^cThe lead of a  ^*b9^*n or ^*b10^*n   shows: 
|n^|3|at|
^c^*b    No^*n  higher honour     
^b     |n^|4|at|or|n^|3|at| 
^c^*b    Two^*n  higher honours, including the next highest honour.

^cThis means: Lead of the 
|n^|9|at|^d@2
|n^|b|at| 
      9  ^ffrom     ^*u9^*n8x      Q10^*u9^*n     K10^*u9^*n     A10^*u9^*n
    10   ^ffrom     ^*u10^*n9x    KJ^*u10^*n      AJ^*u10^*n 
|n^|9|at|  
  Jack   ^ffrom     ^*uJ^*n10x
|n^|9|at|
Queen    ^ffrom     ^*uQ^*nJ10    (and from   K^*uQ^*n109   if you want partner to unblock with the Jack).
^b@2
The idea with Coded 9's and 10's is that if you can "see" the next highest honour in dummy or in your own hand, assume partner has nothing higher, but otherwise assume that partner has it and a higher honour.

So if partner leads the 10@h against a NT contract and you have  Kxxx  and dummy goes down with xx, then assume partner has  AJ^*u10^*nx(x)  and rise with the King to return the suit, but if Dummy goes down with  Jxx, then play low, because partner has probably led from  ^*u10^*n98x.

Let's look again at the previous hand and bidding, this time, playing coded 9's and 10's.|

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at| I prefer Strong 10's, Plenty of people prefer coded 9's and 10's.

^dWhat you learnt first.
^dWhat you think works best most frequently.
^dHow much you want to be different within the (good player) crowd.  (IMO) Strong 10's are less common.

^*bRuah: ^*n Alerting ? 

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|     I think you should tell Opps you're playing Strong 10's (or Coded) when you exchange info about your carding methods at the start of play.

The way I always alert my system and carding when I sit down to play against anyone is along the following lines:  
|n^|6|at|
^c Hi opps, wlc.
^c Precision this way.
^c Our 1NT is 10-12 nv & 13-15 Vul.

fp|t-title|at|Carding        Honour Leads |fp||at|      ^^^^|
lg|c|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|     Next up is honour leads.    
|n^|5|at| 
Once again, I suspect most of you were brought up with the mnemonic "Ace for Attitude, King for Count" or something similar when considering what to lead from AK???, depending on what kind of signal you want from partner.
|n^|0|at| 
Personally this idea has always seemed completely cock-eyed to me: You will mostly lead the King from KQ??? and normally you will be wanting an attitude signal from partner in those circumstances depending n whether they have the Ace and/or the Jack or not.
|n^|0|at| 
It therefore makes MUCH more sense to me to use the Ace from AK to ask for COUNT, and the King from AK or KQ to ask for ATTITUDE.
|n^|0|at| 
Lead the Queen from QJ OR from KQ when you want partner to unblock the jack if they hold it (ie: from KQ109??).
|n^|0|at| 
Lead the Jack ONLY from J10 with no higher honour than the Jack.
|n^|0|at| 
That system of honour leads combined with Strong Tens (or Coded 9's and 10's, but I've always had a preference for Strong 10's) is a robust system of honour leads that has enough "system" in it to give you an edge without becoming overly complex.
|n^|0|at| 
I've tried Roman leads and the full set of "Journalist" leads in the past but never ended up seeing any great advantage in them.|

lg|c|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|     Any questions on Leads from Honours or interior sequences? 


^*bIsabelle10: ^*n  I have it that Ace asks partner to play honour if they have one.

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|     I don't play that, but I have seen that in use.

I think you have to give partner enough credit to unblock the Ace, King or Queen from  Hx  if the situation seems right.

Asking for the unblock of the JACK if partner has it when you lead the Queen from KQ109(x) is much more useful.

ok?.

The next thorny question is whether to show attitude or count at any particular stage.

There is no "right" answer to this and one of the reasons I have raised this is related to the next topic (Odd/Even signalling).

Here (over the page) are two guidelines that might help you and your partner|

nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|Carding        Lead Guideline 1     Ace King combinations|fp||at|      ^^^^|
lg|c|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|    1. When leading out AK combinations 

When leading out AK combinations, especially at trick 1 against a suit contract, most people use the King if they want Kount and the Ace if they want Attitude.

As I said before, I feel this is the wrong way round.

At the risk of repeating myself: If you're leading the King from KQxx(x), NOW you want Attitude from partner (ie: you want them to encourage if they have the Jack and/or Ace), 

So lead the Ace from AK if you want partner to give COUNT and the King from AK if you want an attitude signal.

Now the lead of the King (from AK or KQ) is ALWAYS asking for attitude.

Of course, one of the best ways to play is always to give partner the signal you think will be of the most use to them so you might end up giving them a COUNT signal if they've asked for attitude,

but Dummy's holding makes it clear that Count is going to be more useful to them Moreover, lots of really good pairs hardly ever play attitude signals on the basis that  Counting the hand  is the most useful thing for you and partner.

But people of that standard have usually worked out half the hand before the opening lead and that's far beyond you and me :)|

fp|t-title|at|Carding        Lead Guideline 2     Take the Bidding into Account|fp||at|      ^^^^|
lg|c|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|    2.  When partner leads, take the bidding into account when considering how to play (assuming you're not required to try to win the trick).

Suppose partner deals and the bidding goes    1@h   -    (x)   -    4@h   -    (4@s)    -    p    -    (p)   -    p

Partner leads the  @hK  and Dummy goes down with   @hAx   and you hold   @hJxxxx

What do you do ?  Lowest to show Count   OR   a clear high card to encourage a continuation when Dummy's Ace takes the trick ? 

Fact is, the right answer could be EITHER and might be NEITHER: 

If declarer follows to this trick it is surely his last Heart so you might play LOW to show ^*b COUNT ^*n and the bidding will make it clear to partner that you likely have 5 Hearts and therefore there is no point in continuing.

Alternatively you might hold length in the trump suit and see a chance to force declarer and make them lose trump control, in which case you might give an ^*b ATTITUDE ^*n signal to encourage a continuation.

Lastly, though, you might even give a ^*b SUIT PREFERENCE ^*n signal.  (Perhaps you hold AQJ over a King of Dummy's in another side-suit and can direct partner to lead that suit at their next opportunity).

How is partner supposed to know?

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|    How is partner supposed to know?
 
Well it's a fairly common thing to give a suit preference signal when there's clearly  no point  in continuing with a suit (or when you've giving partner a ruff) and given the start of the bidding    1@h   -  (X)  -   4@h ...    it's likely you have 4 or more probably 5 Hearts.

So it's unlikely that a second round of Hearts will get you a trick.  So Partner needs to be alert to that and EXPECT a suit preference signal from you.

Obviously if you're playing Odd/Even signals, you can often give  Count,  Attitude AND  Suit Preference   all at the same time.

The thing is for you and partner to be alive to the three possibilities and for both of you to be "switched on" 
enough to 
|n^|6|at|
^c@.   think of giving the most appropriate signal     AND
|n^|b|at|
^c@.   partner being "aware" enough to take the right inference and act upon it when they next have the lead.


That can take us  to guideline number 3|

^c    |fp|t-title|at|HIT  PARTNER  OVER  THE  HEAD  WITH  THEM |fp||at|


In the example I gave earlier, if you want a Diamond lead, then play the  @hJ  under Dummy's Ace to ask for a Diamond next time they have the chance.

Signalling with the 6 and expecting partner to consistently guess that that is a high (or low) card is unrealistic.

Sometimes you may have no choice, but if you can make it more  OBVIOUS for partner, then do so.

Subtle signals usually end up getting missed unless you and your partner really are on identical wavelengths.

Personally I use o/e signals and discards throughout given a choice Signals and Discards.

There are many different methods of signalling and discarding.  I'll play any of them, but my preference, by a country mile, is for o/e signals and discards.

If you have another favourite and that works for you, then that's great, but I OFTEN find myself stuck playing other signalling methods than o/e, but it's VERY rare for me to get "stuck", playing o/e.


This brings me nicely into the next topic, which is a plug for Odd / Even (AKA Roman) signals and discards.|

lg|c|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|    This is one defensive tool I really urge you to consider using.

Odd / Even signals often remove the doubts and difficulties outlined above.

For some weird reason the ACBL have a real DOWN on o/e signals, but most of the rest of the world think they're fine.
|n^|5|at|
The scheme is as follows and this caters for BOTH signals AND discards: 
|n^|7|at|
    @.   An   ODD   card (3, 5, 7, 9, J, K)    ^*bEN^*ncourages  in ^*b THAT ^*n suit.
|n^|7|at|
    @.   An  EVEN  card (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, Q)  ^*bDIS^*ncourages  in ^*b THAT ^*n suit   AND
|n^|c|at|
^d^*bAND^*n    is NORMALLY (not always) a McKinney/Lavinthal-style   SUIT PREFERENCE SIGNAL.
|n^|7|at|
^c   Thus a  LOW  EVEN  card asks for a lower-ranking suit and a  HIGH  EVEN  card for a higher-ranking suit.
^b@2
You give ^*b Count ^*n in the normal way ('peter' with an even number and low-high with an odd number of cards).

So when signalling you can sometimes give  Count  AND  Attitude  at the same time (sometimes even all 3) and you should usually aim to give partner as much information as possible (bearing in mind, however, that you are giving declarer the same information).

So if partner doesn't need to know (perhaps you can tell he will have no decisions to make) then feel free to deceive declarer all you like <grin>.

By the way, that is good approach whatever methods you are using.  If it cannot possibly make the slightest difference to partner, then feel free to lie your head off in the hope that Declarer might be misled.|

lg|c|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|    If you find that you do not have the right cards to be able to signal accurately then two things will help:

^b   @.   If @2you want to ENCOURAGE but have no odd cards to do so,  then ask for an UNLIKELY suit. (Perhaps you are sat under dummy, which has AQJxx in a suit.)   So ask for THAT suit and partner will hopefully work it out.

^b   @.   When your partner is signalling, you have to be alive to how much of a choice he has of what card to play:
If you have  AK863  in a suit and dummy holds  J742  in that suit, when you lead the Ace and partner plays
the 10, this is not necessarily a request to switch to the higher-ranking suit.
|n^|7|at|
Her choice as to which even card to play and even what card to play at all is constrained here.
|n^|7|at|
Between you and dummy you hold the 2, 4, 6 and 8, so the 10 may simply be giving count or just discouraging and not particularly telling you what suit to switch to.
^b@2
No system of signals and discards is absolutely all-encompassing and never leaves you stuck for a signal, but Odd/Even signals are the closest I have ever come across.

Some people only use O/E discards on the FIRST discard.
|n^|5|at|
This is okay, but sometimes it can help to be able to signal twice, so I personally do not play that.
|n^|5|at|
One thing: As I said before, for some weird reason the ACBL have their knickers in a twist about Odd/Even Signals, so if you're playing in one of their tourneys you will not normally be able to use them, except perhaps on the FIRST discard.
|n^|5|at|
Just something to be aware of.     Again, the rest of the Bridge world generally has no problems with o/e signals and discards.

Any questions on o/e signals? |

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|    Giving Count accurately when declarer is leading from their own hand or from dummy can be VERY important.

This can tell partner whether or not to hold up an honour and generally give them information about the distribution of the hand and enable them to count the hand.

^^No pause for thought: put on the most bored expression you can and play low.
|n^|5|at|
If you stop and think about it, even for an instant, declarer will rumble you.
|n^|5|at|
The key here is partner playing low, suggesting 3 cards in the suit.
|n^|5|at|
You know that dummy has no outside entries so you must blank your  K@d  in the hope that declarer returns to hand and repeats the finesse a second time.
|n^|5|at|
If partner carelessly plays the card nearest their thumb and happens to suggest only 2 cards in the suit that means declarer has 3, so no point in your holding up  -  better to win and lead a Heart in the hope that partner has something like the K@c.
|n^|5|at|
Similarly, if you think AT ALL about which card to play, Declarer may twig that you are holding up with the King and now they have no option but to cash the Ace and drop your held-up King.|

lg|c|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|    Similarly if you hold xxx in a suit.

Partner leads the Ace of that suit against a NT contract.

and dummy goes down with something like Jxx.

Very important that you give Count (ie: lowest) so that partner knows to play a small one at the second trick, keeping communication between the hands open, 

whereas if you hold only 2, important to tell partner as now they can play King and another and give you a suit-preference signal on the 3rd trick.

This is partly what I meant about really good pairs using almost exclusively COUNT signals, because partner can normally work out your attitude from everything else they can see.

Once again, feel free to try to mislead Declarer as much as possible when it cannot possibly make any significant difference to partner.

lg|c|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|    Suit preference signals are VERY important, as I've mentioned in a few places tonight.

Effective communication between defenders is a prerequisite to effective defence.

Sometimes you can use odd/even or lavinthal (or natural or udca) signals and discards to tell each other what you want partner to know.

Sometimes that's not enough.

Most of you will, for example, try to give suit preference signals when giving partner a ruff to give your partner a clue as to where they can get back into your hand to give them another ruff.

There are many other instances however, where this kind of suit preference signal should be uppermost in your mind.

I say that because it's not much help giving a suit preference signal and partner not being aware that that is what it is.

Partner leads the K@h and Dummy goes down with @sA98x, @hAxx, @d109xx, @cxx.

at|^^^^If partner has the  @hQJ  she will probably continue the suit regardless, but if Declarer started with @hJxx (a Bath Coup).     It is now essential to get partner to lead a Spade at trick 2 so that you can gain the lead quickly and fire through a second Heart from your side.

So on the first trick you need to play the  10@h  to suggest a Spade switch, but partner also needs to be alive to the likelyhood that in the event of Declarer ducking in Dummy at trick 1, you'll try to give a suit preference signal if you're not encouraging a continuation.

Also, worth noting that you want to play the 9 or 10 on the first trick to try to avoid blocking partner's suit if Declarer is holding up with @hJxx in hand.

This sort of thing applies whatever signals and discards you're playing.|

at|^^^^If you lead  anything other than the  2@h  (to suggest a Club return), then you are missing the plot.

If Declarer has the  A@h,  then the likelyhood is that you're not going to defeat this contract.

It's essential to get your 3 quick tricks if they're there to be got and then you can sit back and wait for the  K@s.

Once again, don't try to be subtle or to play it safe when signalling for a suit switch In that situation about, Declarer might have the A@h (in which case they'll surely play it whatever Heart you lead), but if partner has the A@h, it's surely the only chance you have of getting a Club ruff from partner, so MAKE SURE they understand.

If you play safe and lead the K@h, will partner overtake holding  @hA10xx?  Maybe, maybe not, but if you lead back the  @h2,  then the message is unmistakeable.|
