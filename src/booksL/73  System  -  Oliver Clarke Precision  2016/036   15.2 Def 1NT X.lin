lg|c|	
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Hi Everyone and welcome to today's session, in which we'll be taking a look at how to cope when Partner's 1NT Opening is doubled for penalties.

As you will see, the main emphasis here is on achieving two things: Firstly, we NEVER play in 1NT doubled, and Secondly we either: 
|lg|m|n^|9|at|^c@2
1.  Play in a 7-card or better trump fit       ^n OR
2.  Play in 1NT REDOUBLED (which is a game),   ^n OR
3.  We persuade Opps to play the hand rather than defending.
|lg|k|n^|9|at|^b@2
There is no real incentive for us to play in 1NT Doubled.
If we make it the rewards are not that great because it's not a game.
On the other hand if we go off the penalties can be very severe.
Either way it's an anti-percentage spot to play in.
|lg|b|n^|9|at|
If, however, we can find a suit fit with partner, this gives us easier access to each other's hand and increases our trick-taking potential and it also makes Opps much more wary of doubling us for penalties at a low level, especially in a Major and sometimes, even when we haven't found a great fit, THEY blink and decide to take the bidding over.

We don't mind them gaining +140 or thereabouts for a part-score, but -500 is something we definitely want to avoid :) The end result of this is that sometimes we will play in 2 of a suit (doubled or otherwise), but hopefully making more tricks than we would have in 1NT, or Opps will decide they are better off bidding, which let's us off the hook.

Either way we do NOT play in 1NTX which, as I've said, is an anti-percentage spot, especially at IMPs.|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   If you have not already done so, please have a look at the notes I have prepared on Precision Club bidding.

You can find these on: ^*h http://bbo.pigpen.org.uk/1n.php##INTRO ^*n  You might want to have these onscreen in the background for reference during the session.

The other notes on defences can be found at ^*h http://bbo.pigpen.org.uk/Defences.php ^*n

^*bkuphrer:^*n  may i ask why you said especially in IMPs? 

|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  because -500 can be a complete event-changer at IMPs, whereas in a Pairs game (MP), it's only ONE board and that makes less of a difference over the course of an event.

You could just as easily get a zero on a board for scoring -100 rather than -90 at Pairs, but -500 rather than -120 (for example) could set a whole Team match in jeopardy.

There are MANY defences to 1NT Doubled (Wriggle, Helvic, Truscott, BidPig, Hyashi, Swine, to name but a few).

You can Google all of those, but tonight I'm going to show you my own favourite, which is, I feel, the most comprehensive:  ^*b Modified INTRO ^*n.

As I've said, this is just my personal preference.

If you use a different widget that does what you want and works well for you, then that's great..|

fp|t-title|at|Defending  1NT  X|fp||at|      ^^^^|
lg|c|n^|4|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   What's important is to have SOME kind of defence to 1NTX (especially if you play a weak or mini 1NT), because it's NOT a good spot to play in.

If you don't like the sound of INTRO, then go and research something else.

It's less critical is you play a strong 1NT (15-17 or 16-18), because Opps will generally recognise that it's difficult to take a decent penalty against a strong.  1NT INTRO achieves our objectives as I set them out above, in that we almost NEVER play in 1NT Doubled.

We either play in 1NTXX, or in something else, or Opps play the hand.

The key bids for INTRO are the Pass and the Redouble by Responder when the 2nd-in-hand over the 1NT Opening, Doubles for penalties.

The exception (when we might play in 1NTX)  is when 1NT is doubled by 4th-in-hand and Responder decides to stand the double rather than taking it out. 

INTRO's weak spot, if you like, is that it only really caters for penalty doubles by 2nd-in-hand over the 1NT Opening.

That is because INTRO relies on a Pass by Responder being forcing on Opener, which obviously cannot be the case when Responder is 4th-in-hand over the Penalty Double:

^c 1NT   -   (p)   -     p     -   (X)
^c   p      -   (p)   -   ???

Here a Pass from Responder cannot be forcing, because if they pass, the Auction ends.|

fp|t-title|at|Defending  1NT  X|fp||at|      ^^^^|
lg|c|n^|4|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   There are some alternative widgets which DO cater for 4th-in-hand doubles, so you could consider playing INTRO over 2nd-in-hand doubles and something else over 4th-in-hand doubles, because INTRO (especially Modified INTRO) has a lot of advantages over most other widgets of this type when it comes to 2nd-in-hand doubles INTRO allows us to show a variety of hand-types: 
^c@2|n^|5|at|
@.   Relatively balanced hands strong enough to want to play in 1NT Redoubled (or to take a penalty from Opps).
|n^|5|at|
@.   Weak hands with a 5+-card suit.
|n^|5|at|
@.   Weak hands with 4432 distribution.
|n^|5|at|
@.   Weak hands with 4441 or 4333 distribution.
^b@2
MODIFIED INTRO also gives us the ability to show  unbalanced invitational hands where we don't want to risk 1NTX, but do have the values and long suits to potentially reach game.

We can show invitational 1-suiters, 2-suiters, and 3-suiters using Modified INTRO.

I discard on the basis of probability the possibility of Responder having a GAME-FORCING hand opposite a 1NT Opening that's been doubled for penalties.

It could happen, but very very rarely.  The only likely scenario is when 2nd-in-hand is doubling on the basis of a solid 7+ card suit, and we have everything else, and Modified INTRO will likely cater for that.

Having said that, the opportunities to show an invitational hand are quite rare, and normally the emphasis is solely on escaping from 1NTX.

The modifications to the normal scheme are fairly intuitive and easy to understand.|

nt|^z@3^b@2|at|^^^^|
fp|t-title|at|INTRO|fp||at|      ^^^^|
lg|c|n^|4|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   INTRO operates when the hand to the LEFT of the 1NT Opener doubles for penalties.

If the double is a DONT, Brozel or Suction-style Double showing a 1 or 2 suited hand, then INTRO does not normally apply.

As I said before:   One area that INTRO does not really cater for is when RHO doubles partner's 1NT Opening NOT for penalties, but you are weak enough that it's quite possible that the artificial double will be PASSED for penalties by 4th-in-hand.

So if it's a DONT Double, for example, it's just showing a single-suited hand, but if you as Responder have nothing at all, the likelyhood is that your LHO will pass this double for penalties.

INTRO doesn't apply, because it's not a penalty double Here the advice is to run if you have a long suit, redouble to show STRENGTH and VALUES (ie: you envisage the possibility of taking a penalty from Opps) and to pass with a balanced hand not strong enough to redouble and hope that Opps take over the bidding, but you and partner MUST be on the same wavelength here (ie: it's critical to establish what kind of Double it is).

Sometimes you are just fixed  -  one of the risks of playing a weak or mini 1NT, but the advantages greatly outweigh the disadvantages, IMHO This gives the 1NT Opener a reasonable idea of what to do if 
^c@2
(a) Their RHO DOES pass the double for penalties     ^*bOR^*n 
(b) RHO bids something.
^b@2
Responder might also pass, however, with decent values, wanting to find out what Opps have before committing themselves via Transfer Lebensohl, Lebensohl, or whatever.|

fp|t-title|at|INTRO|fp||at|      continued^^^^|
lg|c|n^|4|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   The beauty of having Leb or Transfer Leb available is that there's no reason to leap into the bidding over a DONT or Brozel-style double if you think you have the balance of the points.

If that's the case, there's almost a zero chance that'll be passed for penalties, and now you can wait to see what RHO's suit is before deciding what action to take.

AND have a full range of options available to you at your next turn to bid When 4th-in-hand over the 1NT doubles for penalties this is one of the few times when we potentially allow ourselves to play in 1NT Doubled.

This allows us Redouble as a balanced escape mechanism.

(or play something else other than INTRO when 4th-in-hand doubles, as I said before.)

^*IThe critical thing is that INTRO ^*bdoesn't^*n ^*I really apply when the double of 1NT is NOT for penalties ^*n
|n^|9|at| 
(eg: DONT or Brozel) or when Responder is in the protective position over the double.

Now you need to have a different mechanism for Responder coping with weak hands that have no long suit.

If Responder has a decent hand, then it's easy enough to WAIT and come in later, or to punish Opps later.

Any questions?.

 ok, let's look at Modified INTRO in a bit more detail...|

lg|c|n^|4|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   If either Opponent Doubles for penalties and you have a 5-card or longer suit (especially a Major), the likelyhood is that you are better off playing in that suit.   So after:

^c 1NT   -   (X)   -     ??
^b   or
^c1NT   -   (p)    -      p   -   (X)
^c   p     -   (p)    -     ??

lg|c|n^|4|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   So weak 5+-card suits are easy - we just bid our suit at the 2-level over the double. 

If you have a distributional single-suited hand worth an invitation you can bid it at the 3-level.

Don't shrink from making an invitation, for the following reasons:

It's worth bearing in mind that you or partner have a BIG advantage in this kind of a situation in that you pretty much KNOW where all the outstanding high cards are.

Easy to know which finesses to take and which to avoid.

It is often the case that the defender with all the points will continually find themselves endplayed to make disadvantageous leads.

Ideally you want GOOD Controls and decent intermediates in this kind of situations, therefore.

Aces, Kings, 10's and 9's are great but suits headed by Queens and Jacks are less good if RHO doubled for penalties.

On the other hand if LHO doubled for penalties (sat underneath the 1NT bidder) Queens and Jacks are not so bad, because you can take finesses THROUGH the strong Opponent's hand.

So with an invitational single-suited hand, just bid it at the 3-level over the double but if you have scattered values and an invitational hand (especially a Minor), the chances are that it's more prudent to seek a penalty from Opps 

The thing is that if you have a distributional (but invitational) hand with a marked weakness in one or more suits, THAT is the time to consider a 3-level jump over the double.|

cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Any questions on dealing with single-suited hands?    ok,   let's move onto 2-suited hands.

Playing INTRO  a:  

  ^*bPASS ^*n by Responder over a 2nd-in-hand penalty double is artificial, instructing the 1NT Opener to  ^*bRedouble^*n.

This can be either:
|n^|9|at|
^c  ^*bStrong: ^*n A hand wanting to play in 1NTXX or envisaging a penalty from Opps, 
|n^|9|at|
^c  ^*bWeak:   ^*n with 4432 distribution (ie: two 4-card suits).

So playing INTRO, after 

^c 1NT   -   (X)   -   Pass(forcing a XX)   -   ??? 

Psychology comes into play here, in that Opps will often run into a suit rather than risk your playing in 1NTXX even when you actually have the weak alternative. (You'd be surprised how often that happens).

So if Responder has the strong alternative, they simply pass the redouble.

It is not entirely unknown for Responder with nerves of steel to pass the redouble with a WEAK hand, thereby putting a LOT of pressure on RHO to run (they may assume partner has made a sub-minimum penalty double).

Normally, however, if Responder has the weak 4432-shape hand they bid the LOWEST of their 4-card suits and we bid 4-card suits "upwards" until we reach at least a 4-3 fit.

lg|c|n^|4|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Any questions thus far?

Sometimes it's easy to get to a 4-4 fit, particularly when the bidding starts 
|n^|9|at|
^c 1NT   -   (X)   -    p(forces XX)   -   (p)
^c  XX     -   (p)   -   2@h
|n^|9|at|
here Responder clearly has two 4-card Majors so Opener with 4-card Spades and 3-card Hearts is safe bidding 2@s.
So although I said we normally are satisfied when we reach a known 4-3 fit, we can bid on if we KNOW there's a 4-4 fit available as well.

Similarly when the bidding starts 
|n^|9|at|
^c 1NT   -   (X)   -   p(forces XX)   -   (p)
^c  XX     -   (p)   -   2@d
|n^|9|at|
and Opener has two 4-card Majors, they know Responder must have at least ONE 4-card Major.

Generally, however, we settle for a 4-3 fit and a majority of trumps.   The accent here is on escaping from 1NTX.

Playing  Modified INTRO  Responder, with a distributional 2-suiter (at least 5-5) and  ^*binvitational^*n  values, can jump, over the forced redouble, to the 3-level in their LOWEST 5-card (or longer) suit.

|n^|9|at|
a bid of 3@d would show a preference for Diamonds over Clubs but no interest in game if Responder has both Minors.

After that sequence, however, a bid of 3@s would show a preference for Spades over Clubs, but no game interest in either, but Game interest if Responder's second suit is Diamonds or Hearts (because they bypassed the red suits).

Any questions? okay, 

That that takes care of weak 4432 2-suiters, and distributional (5-5+) invitational 2-suiters now let's move onto the last category, 3-suited hands of any strength and weak 4333 hands.|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |

fp|t-title|at|Modified  INTRO  -  Three Suited   and   4333  Hands|fp||at|      ^^^^|
lg|c|n^|4|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Playing INTRO an ^*b immediate ^*n  REDOUBLE   after a 2nd-in-hand penalty double is showing a (usually) weak hand with
|n^|9|at|
^c 4333  distribution 
^*B  or^*n
^c 4441  distribution.
|n^|5|at|
The redouble instructs Opener to start bidding 4 card suits upwards and, once again, we generally stop when we've found at least a 4-3 fit (because there is no guarantee of a 4-4 or better fit, remember).

So whereas a pass forces a redouble and now Responder starts bidding suits if they are weak with 4432 shape, the immediate redouble tells OPENER to start doing the suit-bidding.

Having said that, it's often easier to diagnose a definite 4-4 fit, because Responder will ^*b ONLY ^*n disturb the suit Opener bids if they have a 4441 hand and Opener has hit their singleton.
|n^|5|at|
(we stop when we reach a known 4-3 or better fit, remember).

The one time INTRO can be expensive is when Opener is 4333 with 4-card Spades.
|n^|5|at|
Now they'll bid 2@s over the Redouble and if responder is 1444 with a singleton Spade you'll end up playing at the 3-level in Clubs on a 4-3 fit.
|n^|5|at|
Needless to say, this might be expensive but it's not exactly a common occurrence.

You can reduce this problem somewhat by Responder showing a TWO-suited hand when they are 1444 (ie: Pass forcing a Redouble and then bid 2@c), because if Opener is 4333, they'll pass 2@c.

The downside is that you might miss a better fit in a Red suit, of course.

Any questions thus far on dealing with WEAK 4333 or 4441 hands?.|

fp|t-title|at|Modified  INTRO  -  Three Suited  Invitational  Hands|fp||at|      ^^^^|
lg|c|n^|4|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   Playing Modified INTRO, we can introduce ^*b invitational ^*n 3 suiters into the equation (ie: 4441 hands) as well as the weak  4333 / 4441  hands.
|n^|5|at|
     (Obviously with an invitational 4333 hand we simply pass and then pass the redouble as well)
|n^|5|at|
Now, instead of bidding the next suit up or passing over Opener's first suit bid, Responder with an invitational 3 suiter will raise the suit if Opener has hit one of their 4-card suits, or bid 2NT if Opener has hit their Singleton.

Leb doesn't apply here and can be passed by Opener if no suit fit is apparent and they'd not accept an invitation.

More on Leb in a minute.

Alternatively if Opener has bid a Minor and Responder's singleton is in the next suit up, they can bid the next-but-one suit up to show an invitational hand with a singleton in the next suit up.

For example, suppose the bidding starts.
|n^|5|at|
^c1NT    -   (X)    -   XX    -   (p)
^c2@c    -   (p)    -     ?            
|n^|5|at|
^c    2@d  ^e a weak hand with a singleton @c and 4-card suits elsewhere
^c    2@h  ^e the INVITATIONAL 4441 hand with a singleton @d
^c    2NT  ^e an @2invitational hand with 4441 and a singleton Club Opener can pass, or bid ANY suit other than @d's at an appropriate level, depending on whether or not they would accept an invitation in that suit.
|n^|5|at|
^c    If Opener bids a Major suit initially, however, 2NT shows the invitational 3-suiter with a singleton in that Major.
|n^|5|at|
^bOnce again, Opener can pass or bid on, showing in the process whether or not they'd accept an invitation.|

lg|c|n^|4|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   About Leb: If we've started bidding suits "upwards" over an immediate redouble, then Leb is available to OPENER, but NOT to Responder      (because Responder needs to have 2NT available to show a singleton in the suit Opener bid and an invitational hand) so...
|n^|5|at|
^c 1NT   -   (X)   -   XX    -   (p)
^c 2@d     -   (p)   -   2@h   -   (p)
^c 2NT
|n^|5|at|
the 2NT here is ^*b Leb ^*n

but if Responder bids 2NT  over 2@d, that is NOT Leb.

Any questions?.

fp|t-title|at|Modified  INTRO  -  Summary|fp||at|      ^^^^|
lg|c|n^|4|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   As you can see, the modifications to the standard INTRO scheme are all more properly EXTENSIONS to the scheme, so you can play all or none of them, or cherry-pick which ones you adopt, if any, without changing the underlying INTRO scheme at all.

The modifications are all fairly common-sense and intuitive, and generally there is no need to adopt any complex scheme of responses.

Let me stress one thing: Where an invitational 3 suiter has been shown by a suit bid at the 2 level, we are (when it's Opener's turn to bid) potentially in  "Leb in Competition"  country, which gives us additional nuances we can inject into our bidding.

Note that Leb does NOT apply when the bidding starts    1NT - (X) - XX - (p)    -   2x - (p) - ???      because we need 2NT available to show an invitational 3-suiter when Opener has hit our Singleton.

Please feel free to investigate and pick one of the other defences to 1NTX I've mentioned at the start.

Pick what works for you.

Most of them simply use different methods to achieve the same ends as INTRO, but for the most part not quite so comprehensively, in my view.

Very few of them cater for 3-suiter hands specifically or was well as INTRO One advantage that SOME of those other defences (eg: SWINE) do have is that they cater for 4th-in-hand doubles a little better than INTRO does (INTRO pretty much ignores 4th-in-hand doubles).

So you might want to consider playing INTRO over 2nd-in-hand doubles and SWINE over 4th-in-hand doubles of 1NT.|

lg|c|n^|4|
cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|   I really would suggest, however, that you play SOME kind of defence to 1NTX, especially if playing a weak or intermediate 1NT, where a Penalty Double is more likely.

Even if playing 15-17 or 16-18, though, Penalty Doubles are not unknown, and you can potentially get into even more trouble with 16 opposite 3 than you can with 12 opposite 7.

Being able to cross to Dummy once or twice is a great advantage rather than never having any possibility of doing so.

So I would research and arrange a defence to 1NT WHATEVER strength of NT you are playing.

Hope you've found this session useful.

Let's practice some hands.

at|    Again, West is stuffed here.     Playing in a Major might be better for them, but they're powerless. to act      +1160 not to be sniffed at on a hand where 9 tricks in NT are not certain but knowing East has everything, they'd probably make 10.
It's worth bearing in mind that Opps rarely, if ever, have any defined defence to something like INTRO, where they're both balanced and one hand has nothing at all, as here.            |

Just pick a suit and bid them like a weak single-suiter, as Roger has done here.|

at|^^4@c may well go off here unless EW does some fancy footwork and NS fall asleep but 2@s does the trick.
1NTx is a mile off, but 2@s is making.|

at|^^The message from 3@h here is unmistakeable.   Again, East MUST have an invitational 3-suiter, and MUST be short in @s, or otherwise they'd likely double 2@s for penalties.   So the Club fit is assured and 3@h is just trying for something better.|

at|   Opposite a 13-15 1NT,   South can be sure that NS easily have the balance of the HCP.
So here  ^*bI^*n  would be very tempted to go for a  PASS  so  forcing a redouble and then passing the redouble.

2@c will make easily, but so will 1NT.|

at|^*blute57: ^*n  So I should  pass and not bid 2@c.
|cp|red|at|^*bOliverC:^*n|cp||at|  Yes, because with at least 22 HCP between the 2 hands, you know East will have pretty much everything.  I know, 1NTXX not utterly guaranteed to make, but it's a decent shot East has to make the opening lead up towards North's hand and your 6-card @c suit is looking good :)    Even if North only has xx in the suit (duck first round entirely and then take the @c finesse on the second round).|

at|South might come back into the bidding here but 2@s NOT doubled is MUCH better for EW than 1NTX even if 2@s is going off.
As we can see South has no way to reach the North hand.

Any questions ?|

I hope you've found this session useful and that it will give you something to use to get yourselves out of 
trouble after  

^c 1NT   -   (X)   -   ???

Next week's session will be looking at Defences to Pre-empts, Transfer pre-empts, 2-suited overcalls and to Multi

Hopefully See you then.
