^b@2^Y@3Marty Bergen has just released an excellent new book, Slam Bidding Made Easier. Howard BBO nickname "hondo717" had the privilege of being one of the editors, and he highly recommends it.   

He held the first of a free 4 week lesson series on slam bidding on Tuesday January 27, 2009. The second lesson was on February 2, 2009 on BBO at 10 PM Eastern. And there will be 2 more lessons on the following Tuesdays. The material for the lessons is from Marty Bergen's excellent new book.  This Tutorial is based on Howard's second lesson.|cs|2|ht|o|va|6|at|^c{ |ht|w|at|^y

^c@e@2^z@3My Dear Fellow-Students:

Under Howard's supervision and mentoring I have been making  BBO teaching movies which you have been receiving one or two weekly.  I do not intend to tell you how much time I spend on each work as for me it has been a great learning experience and a labor of love. What I like to tell you is the tremendous time and expertise Howard is devoting to production and completion of each movie. And this is in addition to his great live teaching sessions on BBO. The current presentation which you are about to review is a good example.

I prepare the movies because they help me learn bridge better and others have enjoyed and learned from them. But, each work goes through his planning instructions, supervision on accuracy of bridge material and tedious and  time consuming  editing before it is released for your review. I know how difficult it is because, it is a real pain even for me to edit my own work.  Howard, however on each movie, patiently reviews, edits and answer my questions without even once showing any displeasure.

This past weekend he must have spent several hours to review and make corrections on two huge "workout" sections which you will see soon in this movie. And that was on top of hours he devoted earlier in helping me to plan and structure them. They are great teaching material. Because of his generous efforts in this movie the Bergen's hand evaluation method is fully explained. Further, you get to practice Bergen's method AND proper bidding all in one as a bonus. After you have reviewed them I am sure you would agree with me.

Now then, here I like to express my heart-felt thanks and I would like each one of you who reads these lines to do the same.

qx|B01,A Note by Kia|
HT|E|AT|
^c@2^y@3What you will view next is my best attempt to bring you Howard's second session on slam bidding. Here again, my priority has been to highlight most important parts of his teaching and repeat them often. Further, as in the first one, great effort has gone into preparing a large number of hands for practicing the hand evaluation. For your convenience I divided them into Workout I and II sections(I like workout better than quizzes.) Moreover, I have tried to make the presentation as close to the live event as possible. 

In spite of my utmost effort I am sure there would be a few errors or glitches. The workout sections are more prone to have errors and typos as it is extensive and difficult to program. Unfortunately, I cannot afford a professional editor or proof reader. Please, contact me if and when you find an error. I am grateful to those who did so with the last presentation. As usual Howard graciously have assisted me in this work. I hope that I have succeeded in my attempt. I would be delighted to receive your kind critique and suggestions by emailing them to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.

Last but not the least, as I mentioned, my main goals are to present Howard's teaching in a fashion which grasps your full attention. Repeat the critical points often so it would stay with you and finally, present a huge number of hands for practice. To that end, in this presentation I am following a different style. As a warm up I like to give you a brief starter on Dummy and Declarer Points before presenting Howard's lesson. This should serve two goals. One you would be ready (or warmed up if you may) to fully absorb his teaching. Two, later it would help me with the workout sections setup. Now, without further ado let us move to the next section.

Okay, we learned that. What is next?|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


AT|

Simple, you are either a Dummy, or a Declarer, or defending. You should re-evaluate your hand's value after each bid.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


AT|

Who is Dummy?|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


CP|5|AT|

The hand which raises partner's suit and that suit becomes trump will become the dummy and should upgrade the value of the hand because there is a fit. The result is the Dummy Points|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


CP||AT|

Please define Dummy Points.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


CP|5|AT|

The sum of Starting Points and Short-Suit Points is the Dummy Points.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


CP||AT|

We already know the Starting Points. Explain the Short-Suit Points please.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


CP|5|AT|

The Short-Suit Points are the values assigned to Voids, Doubletons and Singletons in Dummy's hand according to schedule recommended by Marty Bergen.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


CP||AT|

Next, let us look at his recommended schedule.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT||

%%%%
HT|f|CS|4|FP|1|AT|^-{ Dummy Points }
^-|HT|g|FP|2|AT|^c@2^Y@3
Dummy's Short- Suit Points|FP||AT|
^d1. One point (1) for each doubleton;|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


AT|
^d@2^Y@32. Two points (2) for each Singleton with 3-card trump and three points (3) with 4+card trump;|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


AT|
^d@2^Y@33. For void add 1 point for each trump card. You count 5 if you have 5 trumps.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


AT|
^C@2^Y@3So it is very simple. You raised partner's suit and that suit is the trump. You already have counted your Starting Points. Now, your hand is the dummy and needs to be upgraded. Then, count the Short-Suit points if any and add them to the Starting Points. Now you have an accurate value of your hand and can go further if your Dummy Points warrants.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


AT|

So, what Bergen is recommending is:|
CP||CS|4|fp|2|AT|
^-
{ Dummy Points IS THE VALUE OF THE DUMMY'S HAND AFTER A FIT IS ESTABLISHED }
^-|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


CP||CS||FP||AT|^c@2^Y@3
You have it. Further he has the following important messages.
|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


CP||FP|2|CS|4|AT|
^-{ When you have a fit in a major suit the number of HCP are not relevant }

{ When you have a fit the value of dummy's void is equal to the number of its trumps }
^-

^b@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is the second of my 4 part lesson series on slam bidding, based on Marty Bergen's book ^*ISlam Bidding Made Easier^*N. Last week's lesson was on what is known as "Starting Points", how to evaluate your hand prior to the auction. This week's lesson is a continuation of last week's material. It is on Dummy Points and Declarer points, which is how to change your hand evaluation once you find a fit. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


cp|5|AT|
^b@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me quickly review last week's lesson to set the stage for this week. Last week we talked about Starting Points, how to evaluate your hand prior to the auction. There were 5 rules we discussed.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


AT|

- The first was raw high card points, the usual Ace = 4, K = 3, Q = 2, and J = 1. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


AT|

- The second rule was suit length, 1 point for each card over 4 in a suit, hence 1 point for a 5 card suit, 2 points for a six card suit, etc. Those are the two most important.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


AT|

- The next rule was dubious singletons and doubletons. That is you subtract one point for each singleton K, Q, or J and one point for all doubletons containing a Q or J and not the Ace.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


AT|

- The 4th rule was quality suits. You add one point for each 4+ card suit with 3 of the top 5 honors, such as AK10x or QJ10xx. note that the 10 is considered an honor. |
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


AT|

- And the final rule is the most complicated, but fortunately it does not affect the hand evaluation much of the time. It has to do with the fact that the traditional 4-3-2-1 point count under values Aces and Tens, and, more importantly, over values Queens and Jacks (derisively called "|cp|5|at|quacks|cp||at|" by many experts). You count the number of Aces and Tens, and also the number of Queens and Jacks. If the number of Aces and Tens exceeds the quacks by 3 or more but less than six, you add a point. Conversely, if the number of quacks exceeds the Ace/Ten count by 3 or more but less than six, you subtract a point. Kings are valued exactly correctly at 3 points and they are not affected by this rule.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


nT||
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
HT|E|AT|
^c@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||CS|4|at|So these five rules ^-

{          RAW HCP          }

{          LENGTH          }

{          DUBIOUS HONORS         }

{          QUALITY SUITS          }

and

PG| ***** 29 ***** |

%%%%%%%%%%%
HT|E|cp|5|at|^c@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|CP||AT|This week, we will discuss how you adjust your points even further, once you find a fit.
|cp|5|at|^-
DUMMY POINTS
^-|cp||at|^c@2^Y@3is the first to discuss. If partner opens a suit, and you have a raise, you will be dummy, and you can add extra points to your Starting Points. Dummy Points are actually very easy to calculate. You only add for shortness in other suits. For example, when you have:|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


AT|

- a doubleton, you add 1 to your Starting Points;|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


AT|

- a singleton, you add 2 to your Starting Points with only a 3 card raise. With a 4+ card raise, you add 3 points. So a singleton results in your adding either 2 points or 3 points to your hand depending on how many support card you have; and finally|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


AT|

- a void which is obviously the most valuable asset. With a void  you add one point for each trump you have. For example, with  3 trumps your void is worth 3 points, with 4 trumps it is worth 4 points, with 5 trumps the void is worth 5 points.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


cp|5|at|
^c@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|CP||AT|So that is it for Dummy Points. To quickly review, add:|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


CP|5|AT|^-

1 point for each doubleton|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


CP|5|AT|

2 points for each singleton, 3 if dummy has 4+ trumps  

|CP||AT|and |
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


CP|5|at|

1 point for each trump for voids.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


CP||NT||
%%%%%%%%%%%%%
HT|E|cp|5|AT|
^c@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you can see, doubletons are only marginally valuable, singletons are much more valuable, and voids are really great assets. Now, let us practice a few hands, just counting short suit points, not total Starting Points. In all hands assume your partner opens 1 heart. For now we practice only counting short suit points. I show you the hand, give you a few moments to count then I will give you the correct answer with the explanation if any.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |

HT|k|Va|8|cp|5|AT|
^K@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3 is correct. You have 3 trumps, so the void is worth 3, the number of trumps you have.|

HT|n|cp|5|AT|
^K@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4 is correct. You count 1 point for the doubleton, and 3 points for the singleton, since you have a 4 card raise (if 3 card raise, only 2 points for the singleton.)|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Board 3
HT|r|cs|2|3d|5|at|^b  {|ih|pS7654HAQ62CAK543|at|} |

HT|q|cp|5|AT|
^K@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4 is the correct answer. You have a void, so you add the number of trumps you have, 4 in this case. Note, we are counting only short suit points.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Board 4
HT|U|cs|2|3d|5|at|^b  {|ih|pS76HAQ62D75CAK543|at|} |

HT|t|cp|5|AT|
^K@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2 is correct, one for each doubleton.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


AT| 
^K@2^Y@3In a minute we will practice adding Starting Points and Short Points. But first, I want to discuss the different ranges of hands you can hold.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT||

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
HT|E|cp|5|AT|
^c@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because Marty Bergen adds lots of extra points for length, shortness, and high card quality, the ranges of hands are upgraded when you are deciding how good your hand is. So, using Marty Bergen's methods:|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


CP|5|AT|
^D@2^Y@3- a 6-9 Dummy Points hand is a weak raise;
- a 10-12 Dummy Points hand (including Dummy Points) is considered a limit raise;
- a 13-16 Dummy Points hand is a minimum game forcing raise;
- a 17-19 Dummy Points hand is an intermediate game forcing raise, possible slam if partner has more 
^D      than a min opener, and;|AT|^D@2^Y@3
- a 20 Dummy Points raise is a likely slam hand, assuming you have enough controls.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


CP||AT|

I am sure that you noticed I used "Dummy Points" in all the above ranges, that is the Starting Points plus the short suit points if any.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


AT|

^c@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, to bid game (majors), you need at least 26 Total Points, not 25. To bid small slam, you need at least 33 Total Points between the two hands. Again, remember, because Marty Bergen adds many upgrades, you have to upgrade the number of points you need to bid game or slam. Next, we will practice counting the Dummy Points.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
HT|E|cp|5|AT|
^c@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For the next few hands, you open 1@C and partner bids 1@H. Decide how many Dummy Points you have for each hand (Starting Points + Short Points) and decide what your bid is.|

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Board 5
HT|I|cs|2|3d|5|at|^b  {|ih|pSK2HAQJ8D972CK973|at|} |
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


HT|H|cp|5|AT|
^K@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For Starting Points you have 13 raw HCP + 1 for the quality heart suit, for a total of 14 Starting Points. Once partner bids 1@H, you can add 1 more for the doubleton spade, so your hand is worth 15 Dummy Points. That is a minimum opening hand (13-16), so you bid 2@H.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Board 6
HT|o|cs|2|3d|5|at|^b  {|ih|pSQ943HAK64CAK764|at|} |
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


HT|n|cp|5|AT|
^K@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We have  17 Starting Points plus 4 for a void, (4 trumps.) So the hand is worth 21 Dummy Points. Since partner has at least six, you have at least 27 between the 2 hands, so you should bid game. We have not yet talked about splinters, but the correct bid on this hand is 4@D, which says "I have heart support, 20+ points, and shortness in diamonds."  |
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


HT|T|AT|

^C@2^Y@3If you don't know about splinters, then you would bid 4@H. The 4@D or 4@H bid is not a shut out. It says, "partner I have a great hand -- 20 or more points." If responder has 13 or more, they should definitely be interested in slam. On the other hand  1@C-P -1@H-P-3@H is not forcing. It is just invitational. The hand evaluation can be used both in SAYC and 2/1. Let us look at a few more hands.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
HT|E|cp|5|AT|
^c@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Again, you open 1@C and partner bids 1@H. Decide how many Dummy Points you have for each hand (Starting Points + Short Points) and decide what your bid is.|

HT|G|Va|8|cp|5|AT|
^K@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You have 19 Raw HCP, minus 1 for @SKQ Dubious Doubleton and minus 1 because quacks exceed Aces/Tens by 4. So there are 17 Starting Points. Now once partner bids 1@H, the doubleton is still worth 1 point. So you can add a point back, for 18 Dummy Points. The hand is not nearly as good as it looks at first. Therefore you bid 3@H over 1@H, which shows 17-19 Dummy Points.

HT|m|cp|5|AT|
^K@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The hand has 17 Dummy Points (12 HCP, + 1 quality club suit + 1 for 5 card club suit = 14 Starting Points.)  Once partner bids 1@H, you can add 3 points for the singleton @S, giving you  17 Dummy Points. So you bid 3@H  showing 17-19 Dummy Points. You cannot splinter, because  this hand is not strong enough to splinter. In contrast to the hand before, where the 19 points were only worth 17, this hand upgraded from 12 HCP to 17.|

^K@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The hand is worth 13 Starting Points (12 HCP + 1 length point.) And assuming you decided to raise hearts, your hand is worth 14 Dummy (+ 1 point for @S82 doubleton.) 2@H tends to show 4, but can be done with 3 card support on appropriate hands. Typically, you do that when you have 3 to an honor, and shortness somewhere, including a weak doubleton. With @HKQJ, virtually every expert would have no problem raising 1@H to 2@H. |

Declarer points according to Bergen has two parts, (a). Starting Points and  (b). Additional Points from the fit. Therefore, first count the Starting Points which was covered in the first part of these series. Then, add additional points because there is a fit. This is how it is done.|

^C-- A Singleton is a two points assets.

Please note that a "^*B5-card quality suit ^*N" is particularly valuable in declarer's hand after a fit. Such holding, originally contributes 1 point for length and 1 point for quality to the Starting Points calculation. Then, after the fit declarer adds another point for a 4+ card side suit. Therefore, a 5-card side suit of good quality add 3 points to the value of declarer's hand in addition to its Raw HCP.|

^c@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, it is time to address our next topic which is Declarer Points  also called "Bergen Points" in the book. You count Declarer Points once partner has raised your suit, because you will be the declarer. You begin with your Starting Points, and add the following upgrades:|
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


AT|
^D@2^Y@3- for each trump above 5, you add an additional point, so 1 point for six trumps, 2 point for 7 trumps, etc. This is in addition to the length points you added originally for your Starting Points. So, yes, you are double counting your length.
- 1 point for 2 doubletons, 
- 2 points for a singleton,  
- 4 points for a void, and finally
- 1 point for any 4+ card side suits.|
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


AT|
^C@2^Y@3Voids are very powerful, so Bergen adds an extra point for them above the 3 points many people recommend. To summarize, when partner raises, to calculate your Declarer Points, you begin with your Starting Points and add the following:
^D- extra points for 6+ trumps, 
^D- extra points for short suits, and 
^D- extra points for 4+ card side suits |

There are 2 Additional points after the raise, 1 for 2 doubletons and 1 for 4+ diamond side suit. That is 20 Bergen Points. The partnership has 20 + max of 12 which is only 32, so you should just bid 4@H. Please note that when counting Dummy Points you add 1 for each doubleton. However, for calculating Declarer Points, 2 doubletons are worth 1 point, 1 doubleton is not worth anything extra. |

^c@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I recommend you use it even if partner does not know it. Your hand evaluation is really independent of whether partner knows the Bergen system or not. Your hand is worth the same, whether or not partner is knowledgeable about it. I have been using it since I read the book, even with partners who do not use it, and it really helps. It will take you a while to get used to counting the points, so start with the easier rules first. Start with, for example, Raw HCP + length + quality suits. Then add Dubious Doubletons. save adjust-3 for way later. |
PG| ***** 103 ***** |

Now, let us look at a few more examples. The auction goes 1@D by partner, 1@S by you, 4@S by partner. How many Declarer Points, and what do you bid?|

Don't worry about 2 diamond losers, since partner opened 1@D. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| The fit is established. Opener is the dummy now and has 18 dummy points, 15 Starting Points + 3 for singleton @C. So the correct bid is 3@S showing 17-19 Dummy points.|MB|3SP|

^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| Okay, back to the responder.  How many Declarer Points, and what is the bid?|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| We already decided responder had 14 Starting Points.  You can now add 2 for the singleton, plus 1 point for 4+ hearts.  So total is 17 Declarer Points. Since opener showed 17, there are enough points for slam, assuming you are not missing 2 Aces. So 4N is the bid.  As a reminder, as declarer, you only add a point for 2 doubletons, not one doubleton.|
PG| ***** 119 ***** |

PG| ***** 121 ***** |


SK||nt||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So responder bids 4N, and opener bids 5@H (2 Aces, no Q of spades), and responder bids 6@s.  And if you look at the two hands, 6@S is a great contract, with only 26 Raw HCP.  BTW, if you are off a point or so, it really doesn't much matter. The idea is for you to figure out how to upgrade your hands appropriately. The point is that you can bid slams with good fits, even with not that many high card points.|

^c@2^Y@3Movie Maker: Because of sheer numbers, the hands for practice are divided in two sections, Workout I and II. This section is Workout I. There are no particular pattern. Some of the hands were used by Howard during his lesson. Further, you will notice a "?" mark in each bidding box. It is intended to quiz you for the proper bidding after you have completed the hand evaluation.  

Therefore, in the following examples please calculate the value of the hand based on the auction presented. The auction will set whether the hand is Declarer or Dummy. After you have completed the hand evaluation you would be quizzed on the bidding. Again, please note that as usual there may be other correct bids beside what has been presented here. Howard would be glad to answer your questions.

However, it does not have to. Sometimes you can do it with good 3 card heart support (at least one high honor -- A, K, or Q -- or 2 honors), if your hand is likely to be better in a suit contract. Often this means you have shortness somewhere, particularly in spades. This hand is a perfect 2@H raise, and will be more encouraging to partner than rebidding your suit or bidding NT.

^B@2^Y@3I loved the first seven chapters ^*Ifrom Slam bidding Made Easier^*N by Marty Bergen. The entire book great but for now what I need is a reasonably easy but accurate hand evaluation method. Bergen's method is easy to understand but difficult to remember its five components. I had to find some way to overcome my senior momentosis and remember them. Half way through the first 7 chapters I came with a "FORMULA" which could help me remember them all. I sent my formula to Howard for review and second opinion. He modified it and my final formula became:|CP|5|AT|
^-
(A + L + Q) - D = SP
^-|CP||AT|
Howard liked the idea and I started preparing a movie on it for its release after his lessons. However, the "Adjust-3" became hard to deal with. As you notice, Howard, in his lesson, placed Adjust-3 last in the list. He in fact suggested that for early on not to worry about it because it is hard to deal with and hands needing Adjust-3 appears infrequently. I agree with the last two premises but.

But, I feel different on how to deal with Adjust-3.  Early and quickly, I like to deal with it if there is a problem or a difficulty. Just as in bridge I like to lose the tricks I must early rather than late. Therefore. I combined the first two of his components (Raw HCP and Adjust-3) in one and called it "adjusted HCP count" or "|cp|5|at|A|cp||at|" which is the Raw HCP after gone through the process of Adjust-3. You can call it "laundered HCP" if you will. The rest are easy. I have to remember that "|cp|5|at|L|cp||at|" stands for (|cp|5|at|L|cp||at|)ength point, "|cp|5|at|Q|cp||at|" stands for (|cp|5|at|Q|cp||at|)uality suit point and finally "|cp|5|at|D|cp||at|" stands for (|cp|5|at|D|cp||at|)ubious honors -Dubious Doubletons/Singletons. 

I am sure Howard would allow a report from the minority (real minority) bench and as I have spent a lot of time preparing the movie on my formula and as long as I have a captive audience I would like to share it with you. |

Here, let me quote Howard as his explanation would make understanding this rather confusing subject very simple.|
PG| ***** 363 ***** |


AT|

"Although the traditional 4-3-2-1 method for counting high card points is simple and reasonably accurate, there are certain adjustments that can be made to increase its accuracy. In particular, Aces are undervalued, Queens and Jacks ("quacks") are over valued, and no value is placed on Tens. A more accurate point count system is:^-

{ A = 4.5, K = 3, Q = 1.5, J = .75, 10 = .25 }
^-|
PG| ***** 364 ***** |


AT|

"If you are mathematically inclined, you can count your high card points using the suggested fractions. However, most of us would find this rather complicated. So, there is a simplified method you can use. First, count the number of your ^*Iundervalued^*N honors (Aces and 10s). Then count the number of your ^*Iovervalued^*N honors (Queens and Jacks.)" |
PG| ***** 365 ***** |


AT|

"If the number of ^*Iovervalued^*N honors exceeds the number of ^*Iundervalued^*N honors by 3 or more but less than 6, then add 1 HCP to your hand (because your hand is worth more than simple HCP indicate.)"|

CP||at|^B@2^Z@3"Similarly, if the number of ^*Iundervalued^*N honors exceeds the number of ^*Iovervalued^*N honors by 3 or more but less than 6, subtract 1 from your hand (because your hand is worth less than simple HCP indicate). For example, if you have five Aces and Tens, and two or less Queens and Jacks (quacks), you should add 1 to your HCP. Similarly, if you have 4 quacks and no more than 1 Ace or 10, you should subtract 1 from your HCP. Note that on rare occasions, the difference will be six or more (for example you have 6 quacks and no Aces or Tens). In that case you add or subtract 2 points either way. Marty Bergen terms this method (Adjust-3)."|
