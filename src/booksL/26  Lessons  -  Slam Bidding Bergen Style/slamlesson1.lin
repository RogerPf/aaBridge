^c@2^Y@3Marty Bergen has just released an excellent new book, Slam Bidding Made Easier. Howard BBO nickname "hondo717" had the privilege of being one of the editors, and he highly recommends it.   

He held the first of a free 4 week lesson series on slam bidding on Tuesday January 27, 2009 on BBO at 10 PM Eastern. And there will be 3 more lessons on the 3 following Tuesdays. The material for the lessons is from Marty Bergen's excellent new book.  This Tutorial is based on Howard's first lesson.|

^c@2^x@3What you will view next is my best attempt to bring you Howard's first session on slam bidding. It is not easy to edit and summarize several thousand chat lines into informative and pleasing presentation of this size.  Further, in this presentation my object has been  to use all means to bring out the most important part of the his teaching and repeat them as often as possible. Further, great effort has gone into preparing a large quiz section to practice the hand evaluation based on Bergen's method.

Further, I have tried to make the presentation as close to the live event as possible. Again, please note that I spent my resources mainly to bring you the real message and the spelling and the grammar have not been my concerns. 

As usual Howard graciously have assisted me in this work. I hope that I have succeeded in my attempt. I would be delighted to receive your kind critique and suggestions by emailing them to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.

^B@2^z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is the first of 4 lessons on slam bidding, based on Marty Bergen's excellent new book, Slam Bidding Made Easier. If you have not obtained it yet, I suggest you do so. You can go to my web site, ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge^*N, to see the lesson outline, chapters covered, and to purchase the book. The 4 lessons will be as follows: 

^b@2^z@3The first lesson, tonight, will be on starting points, that is figuring out how good your hand is prior to the auction
^b@2^z@3The second lesson is on declarer and dummy points, which is re-evaluating your hand once the auction starts.

The first two lessons are the most important. They apply to all hands, part scores and games, as well as slams.

The third lesson will be on the specific slam bidding techniques of control bids and Roman Key Card Blackwood.

The 4th. lesson will talk about 2 common conventions, Splinters and Jacoby 2N, which are useful in getting you to slam.

Tonights lesson is on "|cp|5|at|Starting Points|cp||at|", chapters 1-4 in Bergen's book.|

^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Suppose for the moment, we changed the rules of bridge, so that partner could tell you exactly what he had in his hand. For example, suppose partner could say "I have AK32 of spades, QJ104 of hearts", and so forth. That would make the game a lot less interesting, for sure. However, you would not need to count partner's HCP to figure out where you wanted to play. You would simply look at what you had combined with what partner had, and figure out the best contract. Obviously that is against the rules in bridge. So, you have to use the bidding to describe what you have in your hand. But, there are billions of possible bridge hands, and only 38 legal bids. Therefore, you cannot possibly tell partner exactly what you have with the bidding.  But, what you can do, is give him an idea of how strong your hand is, and what your distribution is. So, the idea behind hand evaluation is to figure out how good your hand is and communicate that to partner. |
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


cp|5|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I assume all of you are familiar with basic hand evaluation.  That is HCP, A = 4 points, K = 3 points, Q = 2 points, and J = 1 point. And also distribution. either shortness (void = 3 points, singleton = 2 points, doubleton = 1 point) or length (1 point for each card over 4.) That is actually a pretty good system, and works well on a lot of hands. But, it is not perfect, particularly because the value of your hand changes as the auction proceeds. What I have been teaching you thus far is how to apply judgement, and upgrade or downgrade your hand based on the auction. What Marty Bergen has done, even better, is to come up with some rules that allow you to quantify how many points to upgrade and downgrade your hand.|

^K@2^Y@3I don't know how many times I have heard someone say, "I cannot believe they made game against me with my 20 HCP."  HCP per se do not take tricks. Good fits and distribution are what counts. Having said that, let us discuss how you figure out how good your hand is before the auction begins. In order to do that we need to find out the hand's |cp|5|at|Starting Points|cp||at|.|

cp|5|AT|^K@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|To do so, Marty Bergen presents several Rules. I will go over each one in turn, and present examples. The first 2 rules are the easiest, and the ones most of you are familiar with. They are |cp|5|at|HCP|cp||at| and |cp|5|at|Length Points|cp||at|.|

FP||CP||AT|^B@2^Y@3
For example, Qx and Jx are clearly Dubious Doubletons.  Kx is not a Dubious Doubleton, because the K is not forced to be played under the ace. Other examples of Dubious Doubletons are KQ,  QJ, and KJ.  Basically, as I said, Dubious Doubletons are defined as any doubleton with a Q or J and not the ace. According to Bergen's method you deduct one point for each |cp|5|at|Dubious Doubleton|cp||at| or |cp|5|at|Singleton|cp||at|. Let us practice Starting Points calculation with added parameter of Dubious Doubletons/Singletons.|

^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We have learned 3 rules thus far -- raw HCP, length, dubious singletons/doubletons. There are 2 more rules to go.  The 4th. rule is "|cp|5|at|quality suits|cp||at|" which  is defined as a 4 card or longer suit which contains 3 honors (and the 10 counts as an honor.) So KQ10x is considered a "quality suit" but KQ10 is not (only 3 cards.) You should add one point for each quality suit in your hand. That is a fairly easy rule. And let us quickly look at some example again. I post the hand on screen and a few seconds later I will give you the correct answer.

HT|E|FP||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The last rule is the most complicated. If you find this rule too complicated, you can skip it, because it more often than not does not apply to most hands. However, the basic concept is good to know. The basic idea is that the 4-3-2-1 method for counting points is not completely accurate. With the help of computer, some smart people have done mathematical analysis and come up with more accurate point counts. Using a 10 point system, more accurately these are the point counting based on computer calculations:|cp|5|at|

A = 4.5,  K = 3,  Q = 1.5,  J = .75,  10 = .25

PG| ***** 39 ***** |


cp||
cp|5|AT|
^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, most of us would have trouble figuring out our points using this set of points count. The beauty of 4-3-2-1 is it is relatively easy. Marty Bergen came up with a way of approximating these points count, which he calls "adjust-3" and is much easier to use. The idea is, with the standard points count, aces and 10s are under valued, and queens and jacks are over valued. Therefore, if your hand contains lots more aces and 10s, you should add something and if it contains lots more Queens and Jacks, you should subtract something. This is how adjust-3 works. Count up the number of aces and 10s, count up the number of queens and jacks.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


FP|2|CP|5|AT|^-
If the number of Aces and 10s is greater by 3 but less than 6 (for example you have 4 Aces 
and 10s and only 1 queen), you add (adjust) 1 point to your hand.
|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


AT|
Similarly, if the number of queens and jacks exceed the number of Aces and 10s by 3
but less than 6 (say you have 5 Queens and Jacks, and 2 Aces), you subtract (adjust) 1 point.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |

If the difference is 6+ in either situations add/subtract (adjust) 2.

HT|E|cp|5|AT|
^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| This is rather most difficult part of Bergen's method. If you don't want to bother, most of the time it wont make a difference. What you can do instead is look at your hand. If there are lots of queens and jacks, or lots of aces and 10s, then you can try to apply adjust-3, otherwise don't need to bother.  In other words,  if Aces+Tens outnumber quacks by 3 or more add a point.  If Quacks outnumber Aces+tens by 3 or more, subtract a point. Adjust 2 if one group or the other outnumber by 6+. So, let us practice a few hands and figure out the Starting Points for each.|

HT|u|AT|^B@2^Y@3Currently, I do not have enough experience with this type of hand evaluation and the rule of 20 to give a definite recommendation. However, I will tell you my current style. I am going to try for a while determining my hand values using only the HCP, Quality suits, Bergen Adjust-3 and Dubious shortness and not length. Then if my points and the two longest suits is 20 or more, I will open. With that in mind and ignoring the length,  the last hand is only 8 Starting Points. Therefore, I would not open it using Rule 20 because 8 + 4 (Hearts) + 6 (Diamonds) = 18. I will open the last hand 2@D.|

Let me show you a few examples. First, we should count the QTs and then the Losers. We can open the hand 2@C if both conditions are present.|

^- 
^B@2^Y@3In each panel you see a hand quiz on Starting Points. Choose your answer by clicking the appropriate box or hit the "tell me" box to see the correct answer. In the answer panel you will find the correct count. For your reference there is a summary of Bergen's guideline on how to count Starting Points. The hands are random and there is no theme or pattern. I suggest you do a portion at one time as the number of quizzes may overwhelm you at first.

Please click the forward arrow and good luck.|
