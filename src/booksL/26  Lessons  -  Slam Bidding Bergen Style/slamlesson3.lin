^b@2Marty Bergen has just released an excellent new book, Slam Bidding Made Easier. Howard BBO nickname "hondo717" had the privilege of being one of the editors, and he highly recommends it.   

He held the third of a free 4 week lesson series on slam bidding on Tuesday February 10, 2009. The first lesson was on January 27, 2009 and the second was on February 2, 2009 on BBO. There will be one more lesson on the following Tuesday. The material for the lessons is from Marty Bergen's new book.  This Tutorial is based on Howard's third lesson.|

HT|E|AT|

^b@2 What you will view next is my best attempt to bring you Howard's third session on slam bidding. Here again, my priority has been to highlight most important parts of his teaching and repeat them often. Moreover, I have tried to make the presentation as close to the live event as possible. 

In spite of my utmost effort I am sure there would be a few errors or glitches. Unfortunately, I cannot afford a professional editor or proof reader. Please, contact me if and when you find an error. I am grateful to those who did so with the last presentations. As usual Howard has graciously assisted me in this work. I hope that I have succeeded in my attempt. I would be delighted to receive your kind critique and suggestions by emailing them to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.

Last but not the least, as I mentioned, my main goals are to present Howard's teaching in a fashion which grasps your full attention. Repeat the critical points often so it would stay with you and finally get you prepared for his lecture before hand.

To that end, in this presentation as in the previous you will find a brief starter on Control Bids and Blackwood as a warm-up before joining Howard in the lecture hall. I hope that you like it. Now, without further ado let us move to the next section. 

BTW, You can down load the movies covering his previous two sessions from his site at ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge   ^*N.

{          TWO MINUTE WARM-UP          }
^-
As a warm-up, let us review a few important points in control bids before joining Howard. The material is from Bergen's book. |
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


FP|2|AT|^c@2^Y@3

In a game forcing auction, after a major is agreed, a bid in another suit shows a control in that suit. It is either Ace or King. Could be void or singleton. |
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


AT|

Aces and voids are first round controls. Kings and singletons are second round control.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


AT|

Control bids are bid up the line.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


AT|

If a player bypasses a suit, he denies a control in that suit.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


AT|

A control bid promises a control in that suit whether first-round OR second-round.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


AT|

A control bid at 5 level shows first-round control.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


AT|

A control bid in partner's long suit (usually partner opened that major) promises the Ace or King.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


AT|

After a Jacoby 2NT, a new suit by opener shows shortness at 3 level or a great suit at the 4 level. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


HT|y|va|4|FP||CP||AT|
One more item. I am sure that Howard is going to discuss point ranges to determine when you can use control-bids and 4NT. So let me repeat what he said last session on this issue.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |

HT|g|va|4|cp|5|AT|
^c@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because Marty Bergen adds lots of extra points for length, shortness, and high card quality, the ranges of hands are upgraded when you are deciding how good your hand is. So, using Marty Bergen's methods:|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


CP|5|AT|
^D@2^Y@3- a 6-9 Dummy Points hand is a weak raise;|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


AT|
- a 10-12 Dummy Points hand is considered a limit raise;|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


AT|
- a 13-16 Dummy Points hand is a maximum game forcing raise;|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


cp||AT|

- a 13-16 Starting Points hand is a minimum opener;|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


AT|
- a 17-19 Starting Points hand is a medium opener;|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


AT|^D@2^Y@3
- a 20+ Starting Points hand is a maximum opener. |
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


CP||AT|

^c@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, to bid game (majors), you need at least 26 Total Points, not 25. To bid small slam, you need at least 33 Total Points between the two hands. Again, remember, because Marty Bergen adds many upgrades, you have to upgrade the number of points you need to bid game or slam.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


HT|y|FP||CP||AT|
Now, with "open eyes" let us go to the Chat Room and listen to Howard's lecture on control bids and 4NT.|

^c@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This week's lesson is on the two most important slam bidding conventions. They are:|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


HT|H|CP||FP||AT|
{              Control Bids              }|CP||FP||AT|^land|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


CP||FP||AT|^o{          Roman Key Card Blackwood          }|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


CP||FP||AT|

In the last two lessons, we learned how to evaluate your hand, both before the auction starts, and how to add additional points once you find a fit. Based on the bidding, if you determine that the partnership's combined point count is 33 or more, you know that you are in the slam range. However, 33 points by itself is not sufficient to bid slam.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


AT|

Upon opening carefully listen to partner's response and count the total value of the partnership before further bidding. As opener, your hand falls into one of 3 ranges:|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


AT|

- a minimum opening hand, is |CP|5|AT|13-16 Declarer Points|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


CP||AT|
- a medium opening hand is |CP|5|AT|17-19 Declarer Points|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


CP||AT|
- a maximum opening hand is |CP|5|AT|20+ Declarer Points|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


CP||AT|

As responder, your hand falls into one of 3 ranges:|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


AT|

- a minimum response is |CP|5|AT|6-9 Dummy Points|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


CP||AT|
- an invitational response (such as a limit raise) is |CP|5|AT|10-12 Dummy Points|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


CP||AT|
- a maximum response is |CP|5|AT|13+ Dummy Points.|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


CP||AT|

With a maximum response, you must force to game. Note that until you find a fit, you use Starting Points to evaluate your hand. Once you find a fit, you use the Declarer and Dummy addon points. Therefore, your hand can increase in value (and hence change which range it belongs to) once a fit is established. |
PG| ***** 45 ***** |

HT|f|cp|5|AT|
^c@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Game Force Response, "GF" means, if partner opens, and you have 13-16 Dummy Points, you know you should at least be in game. On the other hand, If both partners have medium hands, you are in the slam range since 17 + 17 = 34, And, if partner opens (which shows at least 13 Starting Points), and you have 20+ Dummy Points, you are in slam range, since 20 + 13 = 33. |
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


CP||AT|
^-
{ HAVING 33 POINTS IS A "NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT CONDITION" FOR SLAM }
^-|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


CP||AT|

The other thing you have to make sure is that you do not have 2 losers off the top.  We all know some form of Blackwood, which allows us to check to make sure we are not missing two Aces. Obviously, if we are missing two Aces (assuming no voids) we cannot bid slam, even if the combined hands have 33 points or more. However, we might only be missing one Ace and still not make slam. That is because we might be missing both the A and K in one particular suit, and neither partner has a singleton.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


AT|

So, in order to bid slam, we have to make sure we have "|cp|5|at|control|cp||at|" in every suit. We can either have |cp|5|FP|2|at|FIRST ROUND CONTROL|cp||FP||at| or |cp|5|FP|2|at|SECOND ROUND CONTROL|cp||at|.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


CP|5|AT|

FIRST ROUND CONTROL |CP||FP||AT|means we can take the first trick when a suit is played. That means we either have the |cp|5|FP|2|at|ACE|cp||FP||at| or a |cp|5|FP|2|at|VOID|cp||FP||at| in the suit.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


CP|5|FP|2|AT|

SECOND ROUND CONTROL |CP||FP||AT|means we have the |FP|2|AT|KING|FP||AT| or a |FP|2|AT|SINGLETON|FP||AT| and that the opponents cannot take the |FP|2|AT|FIRST TWO TRICKS|FP||AT|. They may take the first trick, but we can take the second trick.|

IS TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE AT LEAST

^-|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


CP||FP||AT|^c@2^Y@3That is done by using a convention known as "|cp|5|FP|2|at|CONTROL BIDS|cp||FP||at|" which work as follows:|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


FP|2|AT|

Once a game force is established, if one of the partners bids a suit other than trumps, that is showing a control, |FP||at|For example, suppose the auction goes |HT|r|AT|

{|ia|,1cp1sp3sp?|at|} |
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


HT|S|AT|^n@2^Z@3
Although that does not strictly establish a game force, once the 1@S bidder makes another bid, the partnership is committed to game. Because you are already at 3@S, so any other bid takes you past 3@S, you must go to at least 4 spades. Now, on that auction, the 1@S bidder knows that opener is showing 17-19 Dummy points.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


HT|X|AT|
^C@2^Y@3So, if he has 16 points or more, slam is likely, since 17 + 16 = 33. On the other hand, if responder has 13 or a bad 14, slam is not likely, because your side does not have 33 points. |

HT|f|cp|5|AT|
^c@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us review what responder's bid is promising in the following auctions:|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


HT|I|cs|2|at|^C{|ia|,1cp1sp3sppp|at|}|HT|h|at|^n@2^z@3In this auction South is indicating less than 8 or so points and passes. South knows game is unlikely, since the combined hands do not have 26 points.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


HT|n|AT|^C{|ia|,1cp1sp3sp4sppp|at|}|HT|m|AT|^N@2^z@3With 9 to a bad 14 responder (South) simply bids 4@S, game, since slam is unlikely. |
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


AT|

However, if slam is likely, then responder can bid a new suit. And, if you play control bids, that new suit is what is known as a "control bid", showing first or second round control of that suit. Therefore, in the next auction,|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


HT|u|AT|^C{|ia|,1cp1sp3sp4c|at|}|HT|t|AT|^N@2^z@3the 1@S bidder is showing first or second round control of clubs and interest in slam.|

HT|f|cp|5|AT|
^c@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The rules for control bids are as follows:|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


cp|5|FP|2|AT|
Most importantly, you bid your cheapest control first. |
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


CP||FP||AT|So, in the next auction,|

FP||CP||HT|J|cs|2|AT|^C{|ia|,1cp1sp3sp4d|at|}|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


HT|I|AT|^N@2^Z@3the 1@S bidder (South) is denying first or second round control of clubs because if responder had first or second round control of clubs, then 4@C would be the bid. Thus, if in this auction the 1@C bidder (North) does not have first or second round control of clubs, then slam is not possible, because partnership has no club control. |
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


ht|O|AT|^CEven if South has the K of clubs and the A of diamonds, and the auction goes|HT|P|Va|6|AT|^c{|ia|,1cp1sp3sp?|at|} |
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


HT|O|at|
^N@2^Z@3South must bid 4@C. If South bids 4@D, he/she is explicitly denying first and second round control of clubs. It is imperative that you bid your cheapest control, because if you skip a suit, that means you don't have a control. Any singleton K is a second round control due to the fact that it is a singleton.  The fact that it happens to be the King does not matter for the purposes of control bids.|

^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@C. The first thing to do is count declarer points in this hand, which responded 1@S. You have 13 starting points (11 HCP + 2 length points) + 2 declarer points (1 for 6th spade, and one for 2 doubletons.) So you have 15 declarer points total, since partner has at least 17, you are in slam range. And 4@C is the correct bid, showing the first or second round control of clubs. The @CK is 2nd round control. You are basically worried about diamonds. Partner now can make a control bid. If partner bids 4@H, denying a diamond control, then you simply stop in 4@S, since you know you have 2 diamond losers. However, if partner bids 4@D, you can then bid Blackwood to make sure you have enough key cards to be in slam because you have hearts controlled.

^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||fp||at|You can bid 4@D, which by implication shows a spade control. The reason it shows a spade control is because partner denied a spade control when he bid 4@C.  So, if you do not have a spade control, you know that you have 2 spade losers, and therefore must stop at 4@H. The point of control bids is to determine that you at least have second round control in all suits. If you know for sure that you lack second round control in a suit, then you should stop in game right away.  If partner explicitly skips a suit when making a control bid, that denies a control in that suit. If you also lack a control in that suit, you know you cannot be in slam.

In this auction (1D-1H-3H-4C), partner explicitly denied a spade control. Therefore, if you do not have a spade control, you must bid 4@H. On the other hand, if you do not bid 4@H, you must have a spade control.

As I said before you should not bid shortness as a control in partner's suit. You should only show high cards to partner. If partner bids a suit, and you make a control bid, you are explicitly showing the Ace or King, not shortness. So, 4N is the bid, since you know you have control of all suits. Let me repeat, shortness is partner's suit is not as useful as a high card, so Bergen feels that you should only control bid high cards in partner's suit. But, in other suits, shortness is helpful, so you can control bid shortness.|ht|i|va|6|cs|2|at|^B{|ia|,1hp1sp3sp4cp4dp4n|at|}|

^b@2^y@3That was great. He is going to discuss Blackwood next. However, I have a little treat for you which I have adapted from Bergen's book. First, I have to share a little bridge secret with you. Not too long ago soon after I learned the regular Blackwood when I was playing in the local club one of the opponents bid 4NT and his partner alerted that they were playing RKC and said something which sounded more Greek to me than bridge.|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |

So, as soon as I got to my laptop I Googled "|cp|5|at|KFC|cp||at|" to learn more about it.  No that was not a typo. I clearly understood the gentleman explaining how "|cp|5|at|KFC|cp||at|" was working. When my wife noticed my utter frustration mixed with bewilderment she told me, "Honey, it was RKC and not |CP|5|AT|KFC|CP||AT| and we have not bought fried chicken from KFC lately."|

PG| ***** 191 ***** |


AT|

With Roman Key card Blackwood, there are 5 Key cards, the 4 Aces plus the K of the agreed trump suit. If partner bids 4N, responses are as follows;|
PG| ***** 192 ***** |


AT|
- 5@C = 1 or 4 Key cards, |
PG| ***** 193 ***** |


AT|
- 5@D = 0 or 3 Key cards, |
PG| ***** 194 ***** |


AT|
- 5@H = 2 or 5 Key cards without the Q of trumps, and |
PG| ***** 195 ***** |


AT|
- 5@S = 2 or 5 Key cards with the Q of trumps|
PG| ***** 196 ***** |


AT|

That is known as 1430, some people reverse 5@C and 5@D. If you play 5@C = 0 or 3, and 5@D = 1 or 4, that is known as 0314, but most people play 1430. |
PG| ***** 197 ***** |


AT|

One thing to remember is, once you bid 4N, you are responsible for placing the final contract. Your partner just answers your questions, and should not override your decision. Therefore, you need to know what you are going to bid over any response, before you bid Blackwood. Basically, you should bid slam if you are not missing any Key cards, or if you are missing one Key card and not the Q of trumps. Your decision making as the Blackwood bidder is very straight forward.|
PG| ***** 198 ***** |


CP|5|FP|2|AT|

Bid slam if missing no Key cards, or 1 Key card and not the Q of trumps. |CP||FP||AT|And,|
PG| ***** 199 ***** |


CP|5|FP|2|AT|
You should not bid Blackwood unless you are sure you have all suits controlled, usually by using control bids. |
PG| ***** 200 ***** |

Let us look at a couple of examples. The same drill: evaluate the hand and choose your bid before I give you the correct answer.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4NT is the correct bid. Here you know you have enough points for slam, and you have controls in all suits.
 
One rule that Bergen cites is, "He Who Knows, Goes", and that means if you know you have all the suits controlled, and enough points for slam, you can bid Blackwood. In this case, you have all the suits controlled, and plenty of points for slam, just bid 4N. Let us contrast this with the next example.

^c@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once the Blackwood bidder receives a response to 4N, he may then bid 5N as a King ask. There are two variations to the K response. The variation I have a preference for is to respond with the number of Kings (obviously not counting the K of trumps).|
PG| ***** 210 ***** |


AT|

- 6@C = 0 Kings, 
- 6@D = 1 King, 
- 6@H = 2 Kings, 
- 6@S = 3 Kings. |
PG| ***** 211 ***** |


AT|

The other variation is "specific Kings". If you play that, then you respond with the cheapest suit in which you have an outside K; if you do not have an outside K, you bid six in the agreed upon trump suit. |
PG| ***** 212 ***** |


AT|

The main complication playing specific Kings is if your specific King is in a suit higher than the agreed upon trump suit. I play that you should respond with your specific King even in that case (partner needs to be prepared for that response), but some people play you can only respond with a specific King if it is in a suit lower than your agreed upon trump suit.|
PG| ***** 213 ***** |


AT|

Also, most people play that if the Blackwood bidder bids 5N as a King ask, that guarantees your side has all 5 key cards. That allows the responder, on rare occasions, to bid seven if he has a hand with an undisclosed feature that will most likely allow seven to make (such as a long solid side suit, which will generate many tricks).|

^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||fp||at|5@H is the correct answer. 5@D is asking about the Queen of spades, since you have it, you bid 5@H, your cheapest King. The rule is you make the cheapest bid you can make to show your King. And 5H is certainly cheaper than 6C. Granted, the example is unusual in that it is rare you can show your cheapest King without forcing the hand to slam, but the rule still applies. If you bid 6C, you are denying the K of hearts. It is really no different in concept than control bidding, where if the auction goes, for example, 1D-1H-3H, your cheapest control bid is 3S (not 4C), and if you bid 4C, you are denying a spade control.

^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||fp||at|6@C is the correct answer. In this case, having the 5th spade is as good as having the Queen of trumps. Because you know you have ten trumps between you. You only promised 4 trumps with the 2N bid, but you have 5. And since you have the A and K and a 10 card fit, the Queen will drop most of the time, when the suit breaks 2-1. So, you respond positively to the Queen ask when you either have the Queen of trumps or extra trump length.

HT|H|cp|5|FP||AT|
^c@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The final topic today is how to respond to Blackwood with a void. A void does not count as an Ace. It just counts as a void.|
PG| ***** 253 ***** |


AT|

- if you respond 5N to 4N Blackwood, that shows 0 or 2 key cards, and a void
- if you respond six of a suit to Blackwood, that shows one or 3 Key cards, and a void in the suit you bid.|
PG| ***** 254 ***** |


AT|

However, if your void is in a suit higher than the trump suit, then just bid six of the trump suit, as you don't want to go past six.|
PG| ***** 255 ***** |


AT|

Additionally, you need to use your judgement. If your void is not useful (for example, it is in partner's suit), you should not show it. Also, if your hand is not really suitable for slam, it has lots of quacks and few controls, you should also not show your void. The reason you need to use your judgement is that if you show a void, you are committing your side to slam. So you better be pretty sure you want to be in slam.|

Again, it is time for a few examples.|

The rule for deciding what suit is the key card suit is either the first suit bid and raised, or the last suit bid if nothing was raised.

And if the trump suit is hearts, and partner bids 5D, you cannot do the Queen ask without committing to small slam. But, playing 1430, you have more hands where you can do the Queen ask when hearts are trumps. That is the only reason 1430 was invented.|

^B@2^Z@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@C. The first thing to do is count declarer points in this hand, which responded 1@S. You have 13 starting points (11 HCP + 2 length points) + 2 declarer points (1 for 6th spade, and one for 2 doubletons.) So you have 15 declarer points total, since partner has at least 17, you are in slam range. And 4@C is the correct bid, showing the first or second round control of clubs. The @CK is 2nd round control. You are basically worried about diamonds. Partner now can make a control bid. If partner bids 4@H, denying a diamond control, then you simply stop in 4@S, since you know you have 2 diamond losers. However, if partner bids 4@D, you can then bid Blackwood to make sure you have enough key cards to be in slam because you have hearts controlled.

He might very well bid RKCB regardless. 4@H implicitly shows both @H and @C because if he does not have a club control, we have 2 club losers and no chance to make slam. So there is no reason to go beyond 4 spades.

^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||fp||at|You can bid 4@D, which by implication shows a spade control. The reason it shows a spade control is because partner denied a spade control when he bid 4@C.  So, if you do not have a spade control, you know that you have 2 spade losers, and therefore must stop at 4@H. The point of control bids is to determine that you at least have second round control in all suits. If you know for sure that you lack second round control in a suit, then you should stop in game right away.  If partner explicitly skips a suit when making a control bid, that denies a control in that suit. If you also lack a control in that suit, you know you cannot be in slam.

In this auction (1D-1H-3H-4C), partner explicitly denied a spade control. Therefore, if you do not have a spade control, you must bid 4@H. On the other hand, if you do not bid 4@H, you must have a spade control.

^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||fp||at|4NT is the correct bid. As I said before you should not bid shortness as a control in partner's suit. You should only show high cards to partner. If partner bids a suit, and you make a control bid, you are explicitly showing the Ace or King, not shortness. So, 4N is the bid, since you know you have control of all suits. Let me repeat, shortness is partner's suit is not as useful as a high card, so Bergen feels that you should only control bid high cards in partner's suit. But, in other suits, shortness is helpful, so you can control bid shortness.

^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| In this case, you should bid 3@S, because you need to know if partner has a club control. If partner does not bid 4@C over 3@S, you stop in 4@H. Basically, if you know you have enough points for slam, and you know you have all suits controlled, you can bid Blackwood. Otherwise, start control bidding.

^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||fp||at|6@C is the correct answer. In this case, having the 5th spade is as good as having the Queen of trumps. Because you know you have ten trumps between you. You only promised 4 trumps with the 2N bid, but you have 5. And since you have the A and K and a 10 card fit, the Queen will drop most of the time, when the suit breaks 2-1. So, you respond positively to the Queen ask when you either have the Queen of trumps or extra trump length.

^B@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||fp||at|The important point here is the heart void is probably not useful. So, in spades, you have 2 key cards and not the Queen of trumps, so 5@H is the best bid, as opposed to 5N. @S is the trump  because it was the last suit bid. The rule for deciding what suit is the key card suit is either the first suit bid and raised, or the last suit bid if nothing was raised. The 4N bidder may choose not to play in spades, but the Blackwood responder must assume spades is trumps for now.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, 14 Starting Points is correct (12 Raw HCP + 2 for length in @S and @H) and 1@S is the correct response.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, re-evaluate opener's hand and pick the proper bid.|
PG| ***** 468 ***** |


NT||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| The fit is established. Opener is the dummy now and has 18 dummy points, 15 Starting Points + 3 for singleton @C. So the correct bid is 3@S showing 17-19 Dummy points.|MB|3SP|

SK|N|cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| Okay, back to the responder.  How many Declarer Points, and what is the bid?|
PG| ***** 470 ***** |


cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717:^*N|cp||at| We already decided responder had 14 Starting Points.  You can now add 2 for the singleton, plus 1 point for 4+ hearts.  So total is 17 Declarer Points. Since opener showed 17, all suits are controlled, there are enough points for slam, assuming you are not missing 2 Aces. So 4N is the bid.  As a reminder, as declarer, you only add a point for 2 doubletons, not one doubleton.|

SK||nt||cp|5|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So responder bids 4N, and opener bids 5@H (2 Aces, no Queen of spades), and responder bids 6@s.  And if you look at the two hands, 6@S is a great contract, with only 26 Raw HCP.  BTW, if you are off a point or so, it really doesn't much matter. The idea is for you to figure out how to upgrade your hands appropriately. The point is that you can bid slams with good fits, even with not that many high card points.
