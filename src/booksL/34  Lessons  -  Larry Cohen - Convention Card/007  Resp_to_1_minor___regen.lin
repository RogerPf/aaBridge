cp||at|Note: Not everyone agrees with these ranges. Some people prefer to use 2NT as forcing (13+) to game. In that case, a 3NT response is probably 16-18. You have to make sure with your partner whether 2NT is 11-12 (invitational) or forcing. There are arguments in favor of either treatment. I will give my standard answer: Just pick one, make sure both partners remember, and live with it. (Also, be sure to discuss what 2NT means in competition@-after an overcall, and after a double.)|

cp||at|1)Cohen correctly asserts that most people who play 2 over 1 game forcing treat a 2@c response to 1@d as game forcing. However, I personally do not like to play that. I prefer that 2@c over 1@d has the same meaning as if you were playing SAYC -- 10+ points and 5+ points (e.g. it only promises an invitational hand). Otherwise you have an awkward time bidding invitational hands with clubs when partner opens 1@d. The reason this problem exists is because 1NT forcing is not available over 1@d.|

If you know you will get to bid twice, you can bid your diamonds first (even with 4-4 in diamonds and the major). When using this style, after the partnership starts 1@c-1@d, the opener should rebid 1NT with any balanced hand (even with a 4-card major). He can do so safely with the knowledge that a 4-4 major-suit fit won't be missed.|
