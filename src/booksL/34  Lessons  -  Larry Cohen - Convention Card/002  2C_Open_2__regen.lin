at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bHave you heard of "fast arrival?" This principle says: "Once you are forced to game, jumping to the game is actually weaker." The "fast arrival" into game (4@h) says: "Partner, I am dead minimum, interested only in game. If you bid again, do so because you have extras." Accordingly, the slower bid of raising to 3@h shows extras and slam interest. The logic is that with slam interest you should leave the most room for exploration.|

cp|6|at|If you want to play the complete set of 2nd negatives recommended by Larry Cohen (3@c over 2@h or 2@s, 3@d over 3@c, and 3@h over 3@d) that is very reasonable. But I have a slightly different approach. I do like 3@c as 2nd negative over 2@h or 2@s. But I play there is no way to show a bust hand over 3@c or 3@d.|
at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bFirst of all, I strain not to open 2@c and then rebid 3 of a minor. I will usually either rebid 2N or not open 2@c. So, for me, the auctions 2@c-2@d-3@c and 2@c-2@d-3@d almost never come up. And second of all, because the auction is already at such a high level (our first natural bid is at the 3-level) I think it is more important to be able to bid naturally and preserve space. |

at|^^|cp||at|^bSo I am willing to give up the ability to show a bust hand. Bust hands, even over 2C openers, are pretty rare. So I don't worry about the very rare case where there is a 2@c opener followed by a 3 of a minor rebid and responder has a bust hand. |

at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bI just bid naturally over 3 of a minor. If responder has a bust hand, so be it. You are still more likely than not to end up in the right place because responder can bid natural suits.|

cp||at|Know what you play after a 2@c opener. I recommend 2@d waiting. Remember that 2C is not 100% forcing to game. The approach listed here is not complete, but more than sufficient for any players not competing in National Championships.
