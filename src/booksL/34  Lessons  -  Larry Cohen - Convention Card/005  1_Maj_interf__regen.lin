at|{|ia|-1h1s3h|at|}|at|^l@2|ht|p|cp|6|at|^lIn "Standard" this would be a limit raise. The modern (better) treatment is to use this jump as weak (4 trumps and at most 7 points in support). I'd make this bid with something like: @s5 2@hK J 6 5@d9 8@c7 6 4 3 2|
at|^b@2|ht|s|cp||at|^bWhat do you do if you really have a limit raise (@sA 2@hK J 6 5@d9 8@cQ 6 5 3 2)?|

at|{|ia|-1h1s2s|at|}|at|^l@2|ht|t|cp||at|^lCue-bidding the opponent's suit should show a limit-raise (or better) in support. It shows at least 3 trumps and 10 in support. Opener can attempt to sign off in 3 of the major with a minimum. Of course, this cuebid says nothing about spades@-it is just a coincidence that you have the ace in this example. If the cue-bidder has the "or better" he bids again after opener tries to sign off.|

In recent years, the idea has been expanded so that all bids starting with 1NT (after they double 1-MAJ) are artificial. 1NT shows clubs, 2@c shows diamonds, etc. The one-under bid is still a good raise, and the direct raise is still weak. This "expanded Bromad" is sometimes called "transfers after opponents' takeout double."|

at|^^|cp|6|at|^bIf you want to limit Bergen Raises in competition to auctions where an opponent makes a takeout double, that is fine. But I also play Bergen is on with some other auctions. If the auction starts 1@h-2@c-? or 1@s-2@c-? I still play Bergen Raises are on. So 3@c, 3@d, and a jump raise to the 3-level still have the same meanings as if there was no 2C overcall. Also, if it goes 1@h-1@s-?, I play Bergen Raises are on. Again 3@c, 3@d, and 3@h retain the same meaning as if there were no 1@s overcall. I also now play 2@s shows a 3-card limit raise.

cp|6|at|What Larry Cohen recommends is very reasonable and if you want to base your bidding on his recommendations that if fine. And whether or not you want to use his "BROMAD" treatment is up to you. But I use a different method for raising partner that I feel is easier to remember and just as effective.|

at|^^|cp|6|at|^bOver a double, I play Bergen Raises are still on. Assuming you play Reverse Bergen, say the auction starts 1H-dbl-?. If responder bids 3@h that is a weak jump raise, 0-6 with 4-card support, 3@d is 7-9 with 5-card support. 3@c is 10-12 with 4-card support. Since Jordan 2NT is no longer needed to show a 4-card limit raise, I use 2NT over a takeout double to show a 3-card limit raise.|
