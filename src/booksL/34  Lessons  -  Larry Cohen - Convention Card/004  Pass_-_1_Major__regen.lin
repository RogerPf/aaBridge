Last month, when responder was an UPH ("unpassed hand") there were all sorts of strong possibilities (such as a Jacoby 2NT raise, Splinter bids, 2/1 Game-force responses). Now, the responder has at most 11, maybe 12 points. Everything is different. |
cp||at|^*bEverything, that is, except a single raise. 1@h-2@h and 1@s-2@s should retain the same meaning as by an UPH.^*n|

cp||at|Cohen did not touch on whether or not 1NT should still be forcing by a passed hand. I suspect that he would say it is "semi-forcing" (meaning opener can pass with 5-3-3-2 distribution and 12-14 HCP). I personally think it should still be forcing. One reason is that you need it forcing so responder can bid 1NT followed by 3 of opener's major to show a 3-card limit raise (unless you play Drury). In general, I prefer to keep things simpler by playing that bids by responder have the same meaning whether or not they are a passed hand. The only exception is that 2 over 1 bids are no longer game forcing, simply natural bids showing invitational strength.|

cp||at|A 2NT response can no longer be a Jacoby 2NT raise (game forcing). You can use it as natural (11-12, balanced, probably a doubleton in support). Or, you could define it as something special. Rather than use anything complex, I'd recommend that most intermediate players leave it as undefined. I prefer a passed-hand 1NT response to be up to 11 (maybe a terrible 12) points.|

cp||at|Although Larry Cohen is basically right that, since responder is a passed hand, it is very unlikely that responder can make a Jacoby 2N bid (game forcing raise with 4+ card support), it is possible. Suppose, for example, opener has 10 HCP with 5-4-2-2 distribution. That is not quite an opener. However, now responder can now count 13 dummy points -- 10 HCP, 1 length point, and 2 points for the 2 doubletons. That is enough for a Jacoby 2NT bid. So I recommend that 2NT still be Jacoby 2N, even by a passed hand.|

cp||at|I prefer that Bergen is still on by a passed hand. I see no reason not to play that. You get many more Bergen raise hands than hands that qualify for the fit-showing jump shift that Cohen recommends. (I would bet you would be lucky if you made that bid more than 2 or 3 times a year.) I don't particularly like Drury (especially because I don't think opening light in 3rd seat is that great an idea) so I still play that 3@d (Regular Bergen) or 3@c (Reverse Bergen) shows a limit raise.|

cp||at|I'm not a convention pusher, but this one is in my top dozen. After a 3rd- or 4th-seat major-suit opening, I strongly recommend using 2@c as an artificial raise. It shows 3+ trumps and 10+ points in support (counting shape). This allows your partnership to stop on the 2-level if the opening was light. Without Drury, the responder would have to make a limit 3-level raise and get your side to the three-level (too high) when opener is on the light side.|
