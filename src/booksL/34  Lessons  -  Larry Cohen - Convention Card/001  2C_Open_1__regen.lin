cp||at|What should your HCP requirements be for a 2@c opener? Again, with a balanced hand, there is no decision. With unbalanced hands such as A,B,C, it is a matter of personal preference. Some people count losers or quick tricks. Others insist on having a certain number of aces or HCP. I tend to open 2@c more than most people, fearing that my one-level opening could be followed by three passes. I'd probably open 2@c with all of these hands. That doesn't make it right; many experts would open 1@s with all three hands. All of those hands are much too strong for a 4@s opening.|

cp||at|Personally, I think a strong-club system (such as Precision) is best. Good hands (16+) start with 1C. That means all other openings are fewer than 16 HCP. This makes bidding so much easier. Any time you open, say 1H, partner knows you are limited to 11-15 HCP. This avoids the need for awkward topics such as reverses. If I were to teach beginners, I would forgo "Standard American" and teach Precision. Is it hard to make the switch? Not too hard. Probably 5-6 hours of reading and work would be enough to get started. If anyone cares, by my estimate, 4 of the top 5 American pairs from 2000-2007 used a strong club system. |
