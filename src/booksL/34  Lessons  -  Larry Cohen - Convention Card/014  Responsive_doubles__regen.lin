at|^^|cp||at|^b^*bIf you are new to responsive doubles and want to try them out, then he suggests you only play them when the opponents bid and raise. So ot the auctions 1@h-1@s-2@h-x and 1@h-x-2@h-x, the double of 2@h is responsive. But on the auction 1@h-x-1@s-x, the double of 1@s is not responsive. If you are unsure about whether or not to play responsive doubles, Howard suggests you not play them.^*n|
