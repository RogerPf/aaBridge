at|^^|cp||at|^bIt doesn't matter how Opener's RHO came to make that bid in the suit below, but when there is no room for any other kind of game try, opener has to be able to bid 3-of-his-major to compete for the partial, while also having available a double to try for game opposite a maximum raise.

cp||at|. It shows 3-card support for Responder's suit. It says nothing about HCP. So, if opener has:|

cs|1|ht|s|cs|1|cp||at|^m{}|
at|{|ia|1dp1s2cx|at|}|at|^b@2|ht|x|cp||at|^bThe Double simply announces any opening bid with exactly 3-card spade support. If Opener has extra strength, he can divulge it later. If Opener eschews a Support Double and instead raises to 2S, it promises 4-card support.|

cp||at|There are many other doubles (Snapdragon, Card-Showing, Lead-Directing, and on and on). Perhaps at the end of this series I will fill in some of the more esoteric doubles such as these. For now, the most important thing I can say is that almost all doubles on the 1- and 2-level should NOT be for penalty. When in doubt, assume a low-level double is anything but a PENALTY double. As my good friend, the late Bernie Chazen loved to say, "The Penalty Double has Died and Gone to Heaven."|

ht|d|cp||at|^aHere is Howard's feeling about maximal doubles. They are a nice convention but can be confusing if not well understood. In particular, you have to understand they only apply over 3@d when your suit is hearts and over 3@h when your suit is spades. Thus, for example, on the auction 1@s-2@d-2@s-3@d-dbl, the double is not maximal. Note that 3@s over 3@d is still a competitive bid, not a game try. You can make a game try  over 3@d by bidding 3@h. As to whether you should play them or not. I tried them and no longer play them with many of my expert partners. I don't particularly miss them. If you want to play them, I think that is fine. But I don't think you should go out of your way to play them, especially with partners who tend to forget conventions or are easily confused.|

at|^^|cp||at|^aHere is Howard's feeling about support doubles. They are useful and help in Law of Total Tricks calculations since they differentiate between 3-card support and 4-card support. But you have to understand when they apply. They  can only be made by opener after responder has bid a new suit at the 1-level. And they can only be made when responder' is only promising a 4-card suit. So, for example, if the auction goes 1@c-P-1@s-2@h-dbl, that is a support double showing 3-card support in spades. Responder is only promising 4 spades. But if the auction goes 1@c-1@h-1@s-2@h-dbl, that is not a support double. Responder has promised a 5-card spade suit. Similarly if it goes 1@d-1@h-2@c-2@h-dbl, that is not a support double. The 2@c bid is not at the 1-level and it also promises a 5-card suit. So, bottom line is, if you understand when a double is a support double, they can be useful. I slightly favor playing them. But again, if you are playing with a partner who tends to forget conventions, I suggest you don't play them.|

at|^^|cp||at|^aAs to Cohen's contention that "all doubles at the 1-level and 2-level are not penalty", I don't agree with that. In particular, I have been very successful in match points at doubling opponents at the 2-level vulnerable. Beating them 1 for +200 is usually a top board. I have found that, because the modern style is to compete vigorously, opponents often get overly aggressive and bid poor 4-card suits at the 2-level when they should not. When I have length and strength in their suit, I am very willing to double them. So if a double is not takeout, negative, support, or responsive (assuming you play responsive doubles), assume it is penalty even at the 1-level and 2-level. Having said that, I will say that most experts agree with Cohen.|
