at|^^|cp||at|^bFirst, let's review the obvious. With balanced hands lacking a 5-card major (4-3-3-3, 4-4-3-2, 5-3-3-2), we will always open 1@c or 1@d (unless, of course, the hand falls into an opening range for 1NT or 2NT). So, presuming 1NT is 15-17 and 2NT is 20-21, our opening of 1@c or 1@d when balanced will mean we have either 12-14 or 18-19.|

While 1@d could work better (especially if partner is on lead), I'd open 1@c. Other than when holding really lopsided honor differences, I prefer 1@c on 3-3. That way, partner knows I have four diamonds if I open 1@d.|

at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bAre there any other ways to handle these minor-suit openings? Yes, but I would stick to the method discussed above. A few players aren't happy with the fact that 1@d could (3% of the time) be a 3-card suit. Accordingly, they won't open 1@d when 4=4=3=2. With that pattern they open 1@c and their partner announces "could be short." This strikes me as a shortsighted method: in order to raise the probability of 4 diamonds from near-certain (97%) to absolutely certain (100%), the proponents of this method must now cope with the possibility that a one-club opener may contain only a 2-card suit. Even worse, they have to make that annoying announcement and confuse most other players. It's not worth the hassle.|

cp|7|at|What about 4-4 in the minors? There are three differing schools of thought, but no right answer. Some experts espouse opening 1@c (to leave the most room). Others advocate 1@d (to be able to bid clubs next without reversing), while still others open the stronger (most honors) minor with 4-4. I have no recommendation on this@-other than it isn't very important.|

at|{|ih|pS5H874Dajt5Cak876|at|}|at|^^|cp||at|^b^-|
at|^b@2|ht|s|cp||at|^bThere is no "right" answer. Many experts open 1@c and then have to figure out how to cope with a 1@s response by partner. They either rebid 1NT (with a singleton@-ugh!) or repeat the 5-card club suit (also ugh!). They certainly can't rebid 2@d, which would be a reverse, promising extra values (even more ugh!). I prefer to avoid the potential rebid problem by opening 1@d. When partner (you know how disappointing partners are) answers 1@s, I am ready. I rebid 2@c. It's true that I have lied by bidding my longer suit second. However, I have shown both minors and am willing to live with the fact that partner won't know which is the 5-card suit and which is the 4. I've managed to show both minors and have avoided rebidding notrump with a singleton. Neither approach is perfect@-choose your poison. Of course, if you have 5 clubs with 4 diamonds and are strong enough to reverse, then you can start with 1@c without worries.|

cp||at|With 5-5 in the minors, always open 1@d. Even with extras, don't ever open 1@c, intending to reverse into diamonds. Bid diamonds, then clubs, then clubs again if you get the chance. With 5 clubs and 5 spades, some people open 1@c and then bid spades twice. These days, most players open 1@s with that shape. With a 6-card minor and a 5-card major you have a tough decision. If the major is spades, I recommend opening in the minor and then trying to bid spades twice. If the major is hearts it is tougher--since you may have to reverse after a 1@s response. So, unless you have extras, with five hearts and a 6-card minor, it is probably better to start with 1@h.|

at|^^|cp||at|^b1) I absolutely agree with him about the short club. It is really not necessary to play that because, as he said, you will only have 3 diamonds on 3% of your 1@d openers. So partner can assume you have 4 diamonds. To take care of 3% of the cases by playing a short club makes little sense. But if you choose to play a short club, as responder you still should pass with fewer than 6 points, regardless of how many clubs you have. Do not panic if you only have 1 or 2 clubs.  Over 80% of the time, as Cohen points out, partner will have 4+ clubs. If you bid with fewer than 6 points, you most likely will get yourself into more trouble than simply passing 1@c.|

at|^^|cp||at|^b2) I have a slight preference for playing "better minor" than opening 1@c with 3-3 in the minors. That does change the odds of your having 4 diamonds from 97% to around 87% but it also increases the odds of your having 4 clubs when you open 1@c. The reason I prefer better minor is, if I don't get a chance to bid again, I would rather bid a suit that I prefer partner to lead. In fact, one of the best players in New England plays that he just about always guarantees an honor in whatever minor he opens. So for example if he has Kx in diamonds and 3 small clubs, he would open 1@d! I think this is a little extreme, but it does show you that there is an advantage to opening a suit where you have values. However, if you prefer always opening 1C with 3-3 in the minors, that is fine.|

at|^^|cp||at|^b3) I very much disagree that, with a minimum opening hand and 4 diamonds and 5 clubs, you should open 1@d. As Cohen points out, if you play that, then partner never knows which your longer minor is. If it goes 1@d-1@s-2@c, you could have 5 diamonds and 4 clubs or 4 diamonds and 5 clubs and partner will never know whether or not to take preference to diamonds. So just open 1@c and rebid 2@c if 1NT is not a viable rebid. Yes, you might only have 5 Clubs, but so long as partner knows that, it will work out most of the time. Otherwise, it will often be impossible for partner to determine whether 2@c or 2@d is the better contract. I have never quite understood Cohen's argument because with 5 clubs and 4 hearts you must open 1@c and if partner bids 1@s you have to rebid 2@c. And I don't see much difference between a hand with 5 clubs and 4 hearts and a hand with 5 clubs and 4 diamonds.|
