|ht|i|at|
^d@2^W@3In his excellent book, "^*ISlam Bidding Made Easier^*N", Bergen defined a new hand evaluation which required changes to the point count for the bids and to the hand evaluation in the quiz section in the original movie.

His book is available for purchase from Howard's web site. Further, Howard recently offered a 4 week series of lessons on slam bidding. The material for the lessons came from Marty Bergen's new book. You can download BBO movie of each of his lessons from his web site at ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/^*N in the "Slam Bidding Lesson Series" section.|HT|X|AT|^C@2Please click the "|CP|8|AT|HELP|CP||AT|" icon if you need help viewing this presentation.

hT|e|
CP||fp||at|^-First, a brief explanation of Bergen Raises by Howard.
^-^B@2^Y@3"Bergen Raises are used by responder after partner opens one of a major and responder has 4 cards in the opener's suit. ^*BReverse Bergen Raises^*N, which I recommend, works as follows. Responder must have exactly 4 card support. The point count specified is (Dummy Points), as defined in Bergen's book Slam Bidding Made Easier."|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


CP|8|FP|2|AT|

- with 5-6 points, responder jumps to 3 of the major (more on this later), |
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|
- with 7-9 responder bids 3 diamonds (known as a "constructive raise"), |
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


AT|
- with a 10-12 responder bids 3 clubs (known as a "limit raise"), and |
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|
- with 13 or more responder bids 2N or Splinter (the usual Jacoby 2N raise played by many
^b  partnerships)."|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


FP||CP||AT|

"One of the important advantages of Bergen Raises is the preemptive jump raise (with 5-6 points). Modern competitive bidding theory says it is safe to compete to the 3 level with a 9 card fit, and Bergen Raises allow you to do this in a way that preempts the opponents."|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


FP|2|CP|8|AT|^-

{"If the intervening opponent bids, Bergen Raises no longer apply."}|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT| 

^-|CP||FP||AT|"I suggest you play the following methods over interference. If the opponent bids a suit, 
- a cue bid shows a limit raise (10-12) with 4 card support. 
- a jump raise shows less than a limit raise (6-9) with 4 card support.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


AT|

Over a takeout double, 
- 2N shows a limit raise or better with 4 card support (this convention is known as Jordan 2N), and a 
- jump raise still shows less than a limit raise (6-9) with 4 card support."
|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


NT||
HT|E|at|^B@2^Y@3"Some people play regular Bergen rather than Reverse Bergen. The idea is basically the same, only the meaning of the 3 club and 3 diamond bids are reverse, 3 clubs showing 7 to 9 and 3 diamonds showing 10-12. The reason I prefer Reverse Bergen is that you want to explore for game more often over a limit raise than a constructive raise, and Reverse Bergen gives your partnership more room to explore. However, if your partner insists on playing regular Bergen, most of the value of Bergen Raises still applies."|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


CP|8|FP|2|AT|

"And finally, yes, I still play Bergen by a passed hand. I cannot think of any good reason why Bergen would be off with a passed hand." |
PG| ***** 11 ***** |

What you will read next is an attempt to give you most common Bergen Raise treatments in a table. I used the table from Bridgehands as a template and made the upgrading using Bergen's book and Howard's teaching on the topic. The table contains the common treatments in Bergen Raises. The treatment for rare hands and situations which would be the topic of debates between experts are not included. A thorough discussion with your partner is a must before adopting all or part of Bergen Raises.

It can either show 5-6, and partner should raise to 4 with 18+. Or it shows 0-5, and partner must pass virtually all the time. The only possible exception being she/he is very distributional with long spades and a 5 or 6 card 2nd suit.  --  if she/he didn't open 2@C, then game is very unlikely.

- Partner opens 1@H/1@S
- You have 4-card support
- You have a singleton (it could be an honor) or void. 
- You have 13-16 Dummy Points. Remember, with 17+ Dummy Points you bid Jacoby 2NT even if you  have a singleton or a void.|

Now, time for a few quizzes on Bergen Raises. You are sitting South and your partner opens one of a major. Further, please note that there may be more than one good answer. I have updated the original version to comply with Bergen's new hand evaluation technique. No details on counting the hand values are given here. For that information review either his book or Howard's lessons from his web site.|

^b@22@S is the correct bid.
South hand value = 6 Dummy Points (5 Starting Points plus 1 Dummy Add-ons). Let me quote Howard on this issue, "I really dislike the idea of 1@S-2@S or 1@H-2@H being a constructive raise with 3 card support; most modern players agree with me. So, if the auction goes 1@H/1@S-1N-2@C/2@D-2@S, that shows exactly 2 spades. If you have 6-9 with 3 card support, it is best to raise immediately, as it has both preemptive and informative value. |
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


at| Further, Bergen plays "semi-constructive raises to 2" where with a very bad hand and 3-card support he will first bid 1N and then correct to 2 of the major." |

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|The hand is officially only worth 12 Dummy Points, not 13, as you need to subtract 1 for the KJ of spades. However, because partner bid spades, I think it is wrong to subtract the 1 point, as the J of spades will most likely prove very useful.

So, you should bid 4@D, to make sure you have hearts controlled. If partner bids 4@H, you can then bid 4N. Then, if you are missing one key card, bid 6, if missing no key cards you can bid a grand slam. Basically, you can picture 12 tricks, since you know partner is 5-5 in hearts and clubs. However, if partner bids 4S, you must pass, because you know you have 2 heart losers.

First of all, we need to agree that South should splinter in diamonds. 3@D  bid IS not a splinter, merely a game try in hearts, with diamond cards. Partner does not know South has such a good hand, since 1@H can be made on 6 points. Therefore, 4@D is a diamond splinter, since it is an "unnecessary jump." As to whether you are too strong. The hand is worth 17 declarer points. However, partner is limited to 16, so in this case, a 4@D bid is warranted, because you are not really taking up too much room. What you are trying to convey is interest in slam if diamond shortness is valuable. Without the diamond shortness, slam would be extremely unlikely.

|hf|P|lb|*BNow, What bid would you make?^^4h|HT|q|fp|2|at|^c@2^y@34@h is the correct answer. First remember that 4C means pard has 4 spades, 20+ dummy points, and club shortness. So, slam is quite possible. the only fly in the ointment is that you might have 2 diamond losers. So, you bid 4@H. partner knows that you are interested in slam, but don't have a diamond control. Partner will bid 4@S with no diamond control, otherwise 4N or another control bid with a diamond control. Therefore, your 4H conveys the exact message you want to send.

HT|S|CP|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3I am sure you noticed that Hands A-27 and A-28 are indeed the same hand. |CP||AT|The difference is in the auction. In A-27, the auction goes 1@H-1@S-4@C, which devalues the 1@S bidder's hand quite a bit, due to the club points. In A-28, the auction goes 1@H-1@S-4@D, which improves the value of the 1@S bidder's hand quite a bit, since he has only small diamonds (the J is not worth much). So, in A-27, the 1@S bidder should simply close out in game by bidding 4@S. In A-28, the 1S bidder should look for slam. He can do that by either bidding 4@H (control bid), or jumping right to 4N, since he knows that all suits are controlled (partner has diamonds controlled, and he has hearts and clubs controlled)|

|HT|P|AT|^c^*BWe said this hand is worth  |CP|8|AT|(16)|CP||AT|  Bergen Points ^*N and below Howard makes his point.

^B@2"Bergen points are harder to count on this hand. Theoretically, 12 starting points. Once there is a spade fit, you add 2 for the singleton and 2 for each of the 4 card suits giving you 16. And that is reasonable. However, if you want to get a little more sophisticated at counting Bergen points, you should not deduct 1 for the singleton HQ because partner bid the suit. But you should deduct 1 for the DJ once partner shows diamond shortness. So you end up with the same 16 declarer points, but for a different reason than you might think."
