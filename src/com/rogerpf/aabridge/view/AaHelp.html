<p class="style4">Welcome to the <span class="style5">aaBridge</span> help file. </p>
<p class="style4">aaBridge is a simple Bridge playing app written by Roger Pfister see <a href="http://RogerPf.com">http://RogerPf.com</a> </p>
<p class="style4">aaBridge is in tended for use by those new to the game of Bridge and by others who want practice at the rapid evaluaton of hands.. It <strong>always</strong> gives you good cards to play. :) aaBridge has been designed to be self documenting and all the features are intened to be discoverable just by using them, hence this help file is very short. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style2">TIP - everytime you see an interesting hand, click on the <span class="style7">Quick Save</span> button. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="style4">You can open a saved  <strong>.aaBridge</strong> hand using - Menu Bar - File - Open.</p>
<p class="style4">The thick bars (right and bottom) are 'splitters', drag them to reveal the many dealing options. </p>
<p class="style4">Above all please remember to enjoy using the app, that after all is why we play. </p>
