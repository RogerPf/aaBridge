Stayman uncovers the spade fit and then responder can bid game.

This time however spades is not the best contract when both opener (East) and responder (West) are precisely 4333 shape.

Stayman followed by a new suit at the three level (3@c) would be forcing .

East has a strong hand but not good enough for slam so 'retreats' to 3NT.

Stayman is used first to try to uncover a major suit fit.  When this does not happen, repsonder continues with 3@c showing a strong hand with clubs (and probably spades).  With good stoppers in the red suits opener (north) retreats to 3NT.

First Stayman is used which uncovers the spade fit and then west raises to 3@s inviting game.  East, with a minimum, declines.

This time while responder has 4333 opener has a doubleton and there is value in being in the major suit fit.

When no such fit is found, responder offers 2@s showing a weak-ish hand with a five-card suit (and by inference) four hearts.
