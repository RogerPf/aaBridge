You, South, are the declarer in 6@H on the somewhat ridiculous auction shown above.|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


pc|DT|nt|West's opening lead is the @D10 and, when the dummy comes down, you can see that the bidding is not the only thing about this deal that is ridiculous. Your contract appears to have absolutely no chance. We promise that it is possible to make 6@H, however, if you play correctly. When you go on to the next page you will be able to play whatever cards you want from your hand and the dummy.|

Click on the cards you want to play for the declarer and the dummy. The  ^$6  button on the toolbar below can be used to take back the last card you played. When you have finished playing this deal click the  ^$40  button on the toolbar to read the explanation of the correct line of play.|pf|y|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


pf|n|hs|nh|hs|sh|nt|The first thing you have to figure out is how it is possible to avoid 2 trump losers. It is impossible to avoid 2 trump losers by leading trumps. Therefore,  in order to make your contract, you need to find a very specific lie of the East-West hearts and to come down to a very unusual end position. |
