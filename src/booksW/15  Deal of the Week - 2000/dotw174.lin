This week's deal took place at the World Championships in the first round robin match of the Bermuda Bowl and Venice Cup. The deal has been rotated to make South the declarer. At least 2 declarers found the winning line of play, America's Chip Martel and France's Christian Mari.

Both Chip and Christian have been among the best players in the world over the past 20 years and both have won multiple World Championships during that time. We will follow the action from Chip's point of view, but Christian played this deal card-by-card the same as Chip. Chip was playing with long time partner Lew Stansby when this week's deal was played.|
