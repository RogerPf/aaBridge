Fred was playing with Joey Silver on the Canadian Team when this week's deal was played during the 8th round robin match. Their opponents were Argentina's Leonardo Rizzo and Alejandro Bianchedi. The deal has been rotated to make South the declarer.|

After Alejandro dealt and passed, Fred opened 1@H as South and Joey's 2@H was a "constructive raise", suggesting 8-10 dummy points in support of hearts.|

nt|Fred jumped to 4@H which became the final contract. 4@H was perhaps a slight overbid. A "natural game try" in clubs or a "short suit game try" in spades could lead to a more "accurate" auction. Fred believes, however, that the precision you gain in being delicate in game try situations does not compensate for the information that game tries give to the opponents. Not all would agree.|

Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|sd|nt|Fred resisted the temptation of immediately cashing the @SK for a diamond discard. Fred was worried that releasing control of the spade suit might allow the defense to defeat the contract via a forcing game or trump promotion on some layouts. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sc|ls|ns|ls|sd|nt|Fred knew that he could later gain access to the @SK through the certain dummy entry in the club suit. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|ns|hs|sd|at|There was no rush to take the @SK immediately as Fred had the diamond suit well under control.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|sd|nt|This is a complex deal and the correct line of play is far from clear (to us at least). Fred's line seems like a good one and he did manage to make the contract where most declarers in the Bermuda Bowl went down. |

ls|sh|pc|HK|pc|HQ|at| He was pleased to see Leonardo follow with the @HQ (a possible falsecard, but much more likely to be a singleton @HQ). |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sh|nt|There were 2 certain trump losers as well as the @CA. Fred realized that it would be futile to attempt to draw trump. The defense would gain the lead 3 times and would have the tempo to force Fred twice in spades, establishing a 3rd trump trick for Alejandro.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|hs|sc|hs|nc|nt|The time had come to play on clubs and Fred realized that the suit would probably have to break 3-3 in order for him to have a chance. Fred led the @CK out of his hand in an attempt to drive out the @CA.|

pc|CK|pc|CA|pc|C7|pc|C3|nt|Leonardo (who knew very little about the deal - one of the benefits of not making game tries) won the @CA. As we will see shortly, it would not have helped Leonardo to duck this trick, but winning the @CA made Fred's task somewhat easier.|

up|32|ls|ws|ls|wd|ls|eh|hs|ns|nt|That was a very complicated deal and we have not come close to covering all of the possible variations.  A couple of points are worth noting.  First, Fred could have cashed the @SK at trick 2 and still made his contract (we will leave the details to you). |
