nt|Fred was playing with ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N Vice President ^*BSheri Winestock^*N in the annual intercity IMP match between Toronto and Montreal when this deal was played.  Sheri was the dealer and both sides were vulnerable (the vulnerability in indicated in the upper left corner above - red is vulnerable, white is not vulnerable).|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


nt||lb|*BWhat call did Sheri make?^^1H|
hs|nh|mb|1H|

nt|We like Sheri's choice of opening 1@H (which should come as no surprise as half of "we" is Sheri and the other half is Fred). Sheri had only 9 HCP, but she judged that her playing strength, quick tricks, good defensive values, and good spot cards made her hand well worth opening at the 1-level.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|In her partnership Sheri could not open 2@H (too many hearts and tricks), 3@H (too many Aces), or 4@H (not enough playing strength). Her only realistic alternative was to pass and Sheri doesn't like to pass unless she really has no choice!|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


ls|nh|hs|nd|mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|2S|
nt|East overcalled 1@S, Fred bid 2@D, and West raised to 2@S. Fred and Sheri play that Fred's 2/1 in competition was forcing, but did not promise a rebid (unless Sheri cuebid spades or bid the 4th suit). Sheri's fit for Fred's diamond suit certainly improved her hand, but she still had a difficult bidding decision to make.

|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


ls|nd|lb|*BWhat call did Sheri make?^^3d|
hs|nd|mb|3D|
nt|Sheri chose to bid 3@D and again we like this choice. 3@D did not promise any extra values (as it was non-forcing) so Sheri did not have to be concerned that she was overbidding. The danger of bidding 3@D here was that Sheri might later have trouble "catching up" in hearts. She correctly judged that this risk was worth taking.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|Sheri knew from her own hand and from West's raise to "only" 2@S that either Fred or East (or both) had  been dealt a good hand. She knew there would be more bidding. If East was about to bid 4@S (or anything else for that matter) Sheri thought that it would be more important for Fred to know about her diamond fit than her long hearts.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


ls|nd|hs|nh|nt|On the actual deal it was Fred, not East, that held the good hand. Fred forced with 3@S, giving Sheri another chance to rebid her hearts. At this point Sheri was very happy with how the auction had gone and she thought Fred would be in a good position to decide between playing 4@H and 5@D. |mb|P|mb|3S|mb|P|mb|4H|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ls|nh|mb|P|mb|6D|mb|P|mb|P|mb|d|an|Lightner double|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Fred actually  jumped to 6@D, passed around to East who doubled (a Lightner double asking for the lead of dummy's first bid suit). 6@D doubled was the final contract. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


sk|s|pc|HJ|

at|West led the @HJ . You can now see Fred's hand (yes, he was a chicken not to redouble!). Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on. You can assume that East has the @CA and a strong heart holding.|
