Michael, having bid out his hand, settled for 5@H, but Zia went on to slam on the strength of his major suit holdings. 6@H was the final contract.|

nt||pc|d7|nt|Nanev found the interesting lead of the @D7!

6@H was not a very good contract. Zia needed trumps 3-2 for there to be a chance and there was still lots of work to do. Zia's first problem came at trick 1.|

lb|*CWhat card did Zia play?^^d3^da3|
nt||ls|nd|pc|d3|nt|Zia passed the first test by playing low from the dummy at trick 1. Winning the @DA might have been necessary if Mihov had been dealt both the @DK and the @CA and if the spades were worth 5 tricks. There were at least 2 good reasons for Zia to come up with the winning decision here.|

^y@3^b{ 1.  @2Ducking the first trick was clearly the percentage play. Zia's play needed both the @DK onside and something good to happen in ^*Beither^*N clubs or spades. Playing the @DA required something good to happen in ^*Bboth^*N clubs and spades.}|

hs|ns|hs|sh|nt|Zia could establish the spades with a ruff in his hand, but he would still need to build another minor suit trick. |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|sh|hs|nc|hs|sc|at|From Zia's point of view, it appeared that the club suit offered the only real chance - if Mihov had been dealt the @CA, Zia could make his contract simply by leading up to his @CK. |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|nd|hs|sd|hs|wd|nt|Little did Zia know that he had to cash the @DA at this point in order to make his contract. Nanev's @DK would fall under the @DA and Zia's @DQ would be his twelfth trick. The problem with this line was, that in the much more likely event that the @DK was still protected, Zia would be left with no play for his contract.|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|ls|wd|hs|ns|hs|sh|nt|Zia therefore ruffed a spade in his hand, deciding to put his faith in the club suit. |
