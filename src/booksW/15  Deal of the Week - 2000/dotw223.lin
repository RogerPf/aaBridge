^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 223 - December 18, 2000^*N }
^-
This week's deal is a declarer play problem that our friend ^*BJohn Gowdy^*N showed us.

There is a lot of software news coming from ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N these days. We recently released a new product intended for intermediate to advanced players:

|cs|1|at|^-{ ^*BPlay and Defend with Eddie Kantar^*N }
^-
This product is a collection of 100 bridge problems. 50 of these are declarer play problems and the other 50 are defensive problems. The defensive problems are based on the same deals as the declarer play problems, giving the user a unique opportunity (at least as far as educational software is concerned) to study technique both from offensive and defensive points of view.

Eddie Kantar's sense of humor and clear explanations of difficult bridge concepts have helped to make him one of the most popular bridge authors in history. You can buy this program for only $34.95 US (plus $5.00 for shipping) through this web site. Additonal information about ^*BPlay and Defend with Eddie Kantar^*N can be found at:

nt|We have also finished the development of 2 other educational software products based on original material by 2 more of the world's outstanding bridge authors:

|cs|1|at|^-{ ^*BConventions and the Judgment to Make Them Work by Mike Lawrence^*N } 

|cs|2|at|{ ^*BCavendish 2000 Day 1 by Kit Woolsey^*N }
^-
In ^*BConventions^*N, Mike Lawrence introduces the reader to dozens of popular conventions. There are hundreds of example deals and thousands of interactive quizzes that are designed to give the reader a full understanding of the proper way to use these conventions. More important, the reader's bidding judgement is certain to improve through Mike's clear explanations of expert hand evaluation and the theory behind the conventions he presents. 

This is the 5th program that we have created with Mike Lawrence (information about the first 4 Mike Lawrence programs is available through this web site). ^*BConventions^*N, which is based on well over 1000 pages of typewritten material, is Mike's most ambitious project yet. We expect to have this product in stock in early January.

In ^*BCavendish 2000^*N, Kit Woolsey takes the user through all of the deals of the first day of the 2000 Cavendish Invitational Pairs. With over $1 million in prize money, the Cavendish is by far the biggest money bridge tournament in the world. Not surprisingly, most of the world's strongest partnerships play in the event in the hope of winning some of the prize money. Kit Woolsey is a great analyst and a very successful tournament player and author. His insights into what it takes to win an event like the Cavendish make for fascinating reading. We expect to have this product in stock within the next week or so.|

nt||cs|4|at|Finally, we have almost completed work on the latest sets of extra deals for ^*BBridge Master 2000^*N. 30 new deals will soon be available at each of the 3 most difficult skill levels of this program (levels 3, 4, and 5).  These sets of extra deals will be named ^*BD3^*N, ^*BD4^*N, and ^*BC5^*N.

We apologize to our many loyal customers who have waited a long time for new ^*BBridge Master^*N deals. Our committment to using only the highest quality deals, clearly written bridge movies to present the correct lines of play of these deals, and (most important) teaching ^*BBridge Master^*N to defend these deals perfectly makes the creation of new ^*BBridge Master^*N deals a very slow process.

^*BBridge Master 2000^*N, our most popular product, will improve your declarer play regardless of your current level of ability. If you are not familiar with ^*BBridge Master 2000^*N, we suggest that you read more about this product and download the free demo version at:

^-{ ^*Hwww.bridgebase.com/software/bm2000.html^*N }
^-
Clicking in the purple area above will take you to this web page in a new browser window.

If you are currently using ^*BBridge Master for Windows^*N, we suggest that you consider upgrading to ^*BBridge Master 2000^*N.  ^*BBridge Master 2000^*N is much easier and more enjoyable to use than the previous version and the new sets of extra deals can only be used with ^*BBridge Master 2000^*N. We offer a special upgrade price for ^*BBridge Master for Windows^*N users. You can find out more about our upgrade policies through the web page listed above.

|cs|1|at|^-{ We will announce the availability of these new products both through 
^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N and on the main page of this web site }

nt|You are the declarer in 6@S after a 2NT opening and Smolen sequence. If you are not familiar with the Smolen convention, you can learn all about it in our latest program with ^*BMike Lawrence^*N,  ^*BConventions and the Judgment to Make Them Work^*N. Try moving your mouse over the circled bids in the auction above.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|The basic idea behind Smolen is that after a 1NT or 2NT opening bid, a Stayman enquiry, and a 2@D or 3@D response by opener (to deny a 4-card major), responder can bid 3 of either major (note that this would be a jump in the case of a 1NT opening bid) to show a game forcing hand with 4 cards in that major and 5 or more cards in the other major.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|In the above auction, for example, 3@H showed 4 hearts and at least 5 spades. Smolen fits very well with Jacoby transfers and has a similar advantage: Smolen, like Jacoby, allows the notrump opener to declare the contract if an 8-card (or longer) major suit fit is found. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|Smolen has other advantages as well, especially if the partnership using this convention has spent some time discussing followup auctions. ^*BMike Lawrence^*N offers some excellent advice about what should happen after a Smolen bid along with dozens of example Smolen deals and quizzes in his new ^*BConventions^*N program.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||pc|D2|
at|If your partnership had any detailed agreements about followups to Smolen, you probably wouldn't end the auction with an abrupt jump to 6@S as North did in this week's deal. Then again, a more scientific auction might have resulted in a less friendly opening lead than the @D2 (4th best). Think about how you would play as declarer in 6@S before reading on. |

pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|Ss|ls|nh|ls|Sh|hs|nc|hs|Sd|nt|For example, it is hard to be too critical of a simple line like winning West's diamond opening lead discarding a club (or a heart) from dummy |

hs|ss|at|and laying down the @SA at trick 2. If declarer is going to play the trump suit himself, it is clear to start the suit with the @SA. This will allow declarer to pick up @SQxxx with West, while starting with the @SK will not help if East was dealt @SQxxx.|

pg| ***** 16 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|Sh|at|If a trump loser is revealed then declarer must hope to find the @HQ. |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt|The 2-way finessing position in hearts means that declarer can play either defender for the @HQ. In practice, a strong declarer will be able guess the position of the @HQ over 50% of the time by obtaining at least a partial count of the East-West hands and playing the defender who rates to be longer in hearts for the @HQ. |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|On the actual layout, where West was dealt 3 spades and East was dealt 1 spade, South would usually play East for the @HQ. |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|hs|ns|hs|sc|hs|sd|at|Declarer should try to learn more about the East-West minor suit distribution before making his decision in hearts. In fact, it might have been better for declarer to find out more about the minor suit layout by taking some early ruffs in the dummy.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


ls|sd|ls|sc|hs|Ss|hs|nh|hs|Sh|up|11|nt|It is difficult to compute the exact probability that declarer will be able to pick up one of the major suit Queens by playing in this way, but we suspect that a strong declarer would succeed by playing in this general manner well over 80% of the time (roughly 57% for no spade losers, plus more than half of the remaining 43%). |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|Strong declarers hate guesses, however, even educated guesses. Can you see any attractive line of play that gives South a good chance to make 6@S without having to guess to whom the @SQ or the @HQ was dealt?|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|ls|nh|ls|Sh|hs|nc|hs|sd|nt|We found 2 other reasonable lines of play, but the math is too complex for us to tell you whether these lines are better than simply trying to play the major suits for 1 loser. In both lines declarer starts as before, by discarding a loser from the dummy at trick 1. |
