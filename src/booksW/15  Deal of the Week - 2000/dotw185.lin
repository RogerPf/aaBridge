^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week #185 - March 27, 2000^*N }

This week's deal took place during the recent ACBL North American Championships in Cincinatti. Complete coverage of this tournament, including ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N, of the Vanderbilt Final is available through:

This week's deal features a pretty defense found by ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President Fred Gitelman and his partner, Brad Moss. This deal was played during the first qualifying session of the North American Swiss Teams. Fred and Brad, along with teammates Reese Milner, Marc Jacobus, and Mike Passell, eventually finished 5th in this event.

There are a few minor changes to the ^*BDeal of the Week^*N software this week. The most noticable change is that a small message will appear when you move your mouse over one of the buttons on the toolbar below. Hopefully this feature will make the software easier to use. If you are interested in licensing this software to create presentations like ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N and ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N on your own web site, please e-mail:

nt|South dealt and opened 1@S and North's questionable preemptive raise to 3@S became the final contract. We consider 3@S questionable because of North's flat distribution and his high defense to offense ratio. We prefer a simple 2@S regardless of what The Law of Total Tricks has to say about the matter.|

hs|ws|hs|wh|hs|wd|hs|wc|nt|Brad had to decide on an opening lead and had very little to go on from the auction. What card do you think Brad led from the West hand? Fred and Brad use 3rd and 5th best leads against suit contracts.|

ls|ws|ls|wh|ls|wd|ls|wc|

pc|D5|

nt|Brad characteristically chose to make an aggressive opening lead, the @D5. Some players would think that a heart or a club lead would be safer than a diamond. Some players would lead a trump in an attempt to be completely passive. There is no right or wrong answer here, but Brad prefers to lead from his strength against auctions such as this one. It turned out that his diamond lead was the start of a very pretty defense.|

ls|nd|pc|D2|hs|ed|at|and Fred had to decide which diamond to play from the East hand. Think about which card you would play as East. |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


lb|*CWhat card did Fred play?^^dq^daq94|ls|ed|pc|DQ|pc|D8|
nt|Fred chose to play the @DQ which won the trick. Fred knew that the declarer could not have a singleton @DK since the @D3 was missing and Brad would have led that card (or the @DJ) if his diamond holding had been @DJ10853. There was no danger of losing to a singleton @DK, but there were 2 good reasons for Fred to play the @DQ at trick 1.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||cs|1|ht|e|at| { 1. @2If Brad was dealt the @DK (as was in fact the case) then Fred's play of the @DQ would let Brad know that Fred could win the second round of diamonds if the play developed in such a way that this seemed like a good idea. If Fred had won the @DA instead, then Brad would not know about the location of the @DQ.}|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||cs|2|ht|e|at| { 2. @2If declarer was dealt the @DKx then Fred's play of the @DQ would establish the @DJ as an entry to Brad's hand. Brad would later by able to gain the lead in diamonds to play a club through the dummy. This is the main reason why the @DQ was the right card for Fred to play at trick 1.}|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


hs|es|hs|eh|hs|ed|hs|ec|nt|Fred also had an interesting problem as to what card to lead to trick 2. Think about the card you would return as East. |

pc|S4|at|Fred chose to return the @S4 at trick 2. Fred was able to find this play because he could see that there was a danger if he made the "obvious" diamond continuation. Can you see why a trump return worked well and how a diamond return would have likely been less effective? Watch how the play continued and you will understand (if you don't already).|

hs|wd|hs|wh|hs|wc|nt|The defense had reached another critical point. This time it was up to Brad to figure out what the deal was all about and what card he could return to defeat the contract. Think about which card you would play as West.|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


lb|*CWhat card did Brad lead?^^cj^hj97cj954dk3|

nt||ls|wc|ls|wd|ls|wh|

pc|CJ|
nt|Brad found the excellent play of leading the @CJ (the @C9 would also work). Brad could also feel the danger that Fred had sensed. He knew that he would not have a chance to lead again and needed to make this lead count. The big question is how did Brad know to lead a club instead of a heart?|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|The answer is that Fred's play of the @D4 on the second round of the suit told Brad to play clubs and not hearts. The @D4 was a suit preference signal requesting a club shift. Fred would have followed with the @D9 (and not the @D4) if he was dealt the @HAQ instead of the @CAQ.|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|Fred and Brad are not one of those pairs that almost always signal suit preference. Their defensive carding philosophy is more along the lines of "tell partner what you think he needs to know". Fred knew that Brad needed to know which suit to switch to. He said "Clubs!" with his @D4. Brad trusted Fred to be giving him the information that he needed and defended accordingly. Partnership trust is a wonderful thing!|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sc|hs|Ec|nt|Fred's carding in diamonds told Brad which suit to play. His choice of the @CJ (instead of a conventional low club) catered to the exact layout that was dealt.  Note that if Brad had returned a small club the declarer could get home by playing low from the dummy. Fred would win the @CQ, but declarer could later lead low to the @C10, holding himself to 2 club losers.|

pg| ***** 70 ***** |


up|35|
nt|In order for the defense to prevent this endplay it was necessary for both Fred and Brad to spot the danger early in the deal and to defend accordingly. It is not always easy to construct the unseen hands, project how the play might go, and come up with the appropriate counter-measures.|
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


nt|It makes it easier if you have been a victim of this sort of enplay in the past. Fred and Brad have been playing bridge long enough that they have seen deals like this one before. As soon as they saw the dummy they knew that there was a potential endplay and that their mission was to find a way out of it. Bridge problems are much easier when you have faced similar problems before.|
