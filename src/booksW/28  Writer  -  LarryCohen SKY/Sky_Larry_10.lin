pg| ***** 3 ***** |


mb|1d|nt||ht|c|at|Your partner opens 1@D |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


mb|1s|at|and RHO overcalls 1@S.   |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|What should you do? |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|You could bid 3NT (you have enough points), |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|but it usually pays to look for a 4-4 fit in a major.   |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


mb|d|nt||ht|c|at|You should make a negative double. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


mb|p2c|nt||ht|c|at|LHO passes and partner rebids 2@C. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


mb|p|at|Now what? |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


mb|3n|nt||ht|c|at|Now is the time for 3NT. There is no 4-4 fit in a major and you have enough points for game with a good stopper(s) in the opponent's suit. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


mb|ppp|nt||ht|c|at|Everyone passes |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


pc|s7|at|and the @S7 is led. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|What do you think of partner's 2@C rebid? |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Very sexy, if you ask me. |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


at|He didn't want to bid 1NT without a spade stopper, and didn't want to rebid his 5-card suit. |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|So, he improvised by treating his very impressive 3-card club suit as a 4-card suit. |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


at|This turned out to be a good decision as it made it easy for you to bid 3NT without worrying about the lack of a club stopper. |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


pc|s|nt||ht|c|at|On the first trick, |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


pc|sq|nt||ht|c|at|East plays the @SQ and you? |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


at|This is the time for a hold-up play. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|At notrump you should count WINNERS.  |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


hs|ec|nt||ht|c|at|You have 3 clubs, |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


ls|ec|hc|hak|at|2 hearts, |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


lc|hak|hs|ws|at|and it looks like 2 spades for sure. |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


ls|ws|hs|edwd|at|You will need to set up diamonds. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


ls|edwd|nt||ht|c|at|Your fear is that LHO will win the first diamond and clear spades. |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


at|Then RHO could win the next diamond and his spades will be good-down one.  |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


sk|y|nt||ht|c|at|Let's look at the full deal:|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |

pg| ***** 51 ***** |


hs|nhncnd|nt||ht|c|at|LHO is out of spades, so the defense can never set up the suit. |
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


ls|nhndnc|nt||ht|c|at|For advanced players: |

up|10|hc|s9|at|Note that RHO can foil this plan by playing the @S9 at the first trick!  |
