pg| ***** 3 ***** |


mb|1c|nt||ht|c|at|Your partner opens 1@C  |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


mb|1h|at|and RHO overcalls 1@H. And you?  |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||cq|3|lb|*mYour call is?^Pass~Double~1@s^3|mb|d|nt||hs|ss|ht|c|at|In "Standard," a double after a 1@H overcall promises exactly ^*B4 spades^*N (not 5, not 3).|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


ub|1|mb|1s|nt||ht|c|at|Conversely, a bid of 1@S guarantees at least 5 cards in the suit.  |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


ls|ss|nt||ht|c|at|Accordingly, I love it when my opponents overcall 1@H. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|I get to convey right away whether I have only 4 spades, or as in this case, 5+ by bidding 1@S. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


mb|p3s|nt||ht|c|at|LHO passes and opener raises to 3@S. |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


mb|p|nt||ht|c|at|After RHO's pass, what do you do? |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||cq|3|lb|*mYour call is?^Pass~4@s^2|nt||ht|c|at|Partner is inviting game and you have an unclear decision. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


hs|sh|at|You have a little extra and well-placed hearts (behind the overcaller). |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


ls|sh|hs|ss|at|Your trumps (since you already promised 5 cards) are poor. |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


ls|ss|sv|ns|nt||ht|c|at|If vulnerable at IMPs, |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


at|I'd surely take the push (it is important to be aggressive in that situation). |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


sv|0|nt||ht|c|at|Here, it is borderline. |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt||ht|c|mb|4sppp|at|Let's say you do bid 4@S and everyone passes. |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


pc|h9|nt||ht|c|at|West leads the @H9 - what are your thoughts?|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|In suit contracts I like to count losers. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


hs|nsnhsssh|nt||ht|c|at|You will surely not lose any tricks in the majors (barring anything ridiculous). |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


ls|nsnhsssh|hs|ncsc|nt||ht|c|at|In clubs you have to lose two tricks. |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


ls|ncsc|hs|ndsd|nt||ht|c|at|In diamonds, if the ace has the decency to be with the overcaller, you will lose only one trick. |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


ls|ndsd|nt||ht|c|at|So, is this an easy one? |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|It turns out,|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


hc|h8|at| the key to this deal is your @H8 and you must play correctly to trick one.|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


lc|h8|nt||ht|c|at|Let's look at all 52 cards. |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |

pg| ***** 30 ***** |


hc|da|nt||ht|c|at|As you can see, the @DA is wrong.  |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


lc|da|hs|ncsc|nt||ht|c|at|As soon as you draw trumps and work on clubs,|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


ls|ncsc|hs|ed|nt||ht|c|at|East will play a diamond and you will lose 4 tricks. |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


ls|ed|hs|nhsh|nt||ht|c|at|However, you can prevent the loss of 2 diamond tricks if you make use of your heart spots. |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


ls|nhsh|hc|hq|nt||ht|c|at|At trick one, play the queen from dummy. |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


lc|hq|pc|hq|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


up|1|at|If you don't play the queen,|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


pc|h|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


hc|h4567|at| East will play low on the nine|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


lc|h4567|pc|h|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


hc|haj|at|and you will get only your jack and ace. |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


lc|haj|up|2|nt||ht|c|at|When you play the queen, |

pc|hq|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


hc|hk|at|East has to cover. |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


lc|hk|pc|hk|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt||ht|c|hs|nhsh|at|Now, you can see the importance of your @H8. |
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


ls|nhsh|hc|ha|nt||ht|c|at|You win the @HA |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


lc|ha|pc|ha|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |

pg| ***** 51 ***** |


pc|skhss|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


hc|h3|at| Now you play another heart from dummy |
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


lc|h3|pc|hh|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


hc|h8|at|and take the sure finesse (East bid the suit and West would not lead the 9 from 10-9). |
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


lc|h8|pc|hh|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


hc|hjd72|nt||ht|c|at|Then, you can throw one of dummy's diamonds on your hearts. |
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


lc|hjd72|pc|hddh|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Now you lose only 2 clubs and a diamond and make your contract.|
