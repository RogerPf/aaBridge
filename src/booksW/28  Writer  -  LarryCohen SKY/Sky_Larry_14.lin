mb|p2s|an|game try suit|at| LHO makes a natural game try with 2@S  |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


mb|p3hppp|at|and RHO signs off in 3@H, buying the contract.  |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


pc|sa|nt||ht|c|at|Partner leads the @SA. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|What are your thoughts about dummy's bidding? |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Dummy might have made a counter-try (I like 2NT), |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|but maybe he didn't like his flat shape and lack of 10's or 9's. |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


hc|s8|nt||ht|c|at|Assuming "standard," you play hi-lo to show a doubleton. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


lc|s8|pc|ss8s|at|See my article here - ^*Hwww.larryco.com/BridgeArticles/ArticleDetails.aspx?articleID=263^*N on signaling. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|The ace lead is obviously from ace-king (nobody lays down aces without the king). |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|Your signal is not really "count," but attitude. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


at|If you had the Queen, you'd also want to encourage, so your 8 would be the proper play from Q82 (assuming that high means you like the suit). |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


pc|sk|nt||ht|c|at|Partner continues with the @SK. |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


pc|sss|at|He knows from your hi-lo that you are encouraging spades. |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


pc|s2s|nt||ht|c|at|He plays the @S2 |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


hc|h2|at|and you ruff. |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


lc|h2|pc|h2s|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


pc|sa|nt||ht|c|at|Now what?|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt||cq|1|lb|*CWhat do you play now? ^^c6^cjc6djd2|at|Partner's @S2 is a suit-preference signal. |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Whenever partner is giving you a ruff, he should indicate where his side strength lies. |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


lc|hakq|at|Since he played his lowest spade, you should return the lowest-ranking suit, clubs. |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


pc|c6|nt||ht|c|at|I like the @C6 - you want partner to take his presumed @CA and play another spade. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


up|1|pc|cj|nt||ht|c|at|Leading the @CJ could tempt him to duck. |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |

nt||ht|c|at|I guess East did well not to go to 4@H. On the other hand, he might have done well in notrump with a diamond lead. What happened in SKY CLUB's tournament in BBO:
