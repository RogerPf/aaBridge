mb|pp2n|an|20 - 21|nt||ht|c|at|East opens 2NT (20-21) in 3rd seat |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


mb|p3ntppp|at|and LHO raises to 3NT.  |

nt||cq|1|lb|*CWhat would you lead? ^^s3^dts3h2|hc|dt|at|I suppose the @D10 could work out, |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


lc|dt|hc|s3|at|but I prefer 4th from my longest and strongest. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


lc|s3|nt||ht|c|at|Also, dummy didn't use Stayman, |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


pc|s|at|so spades surely won't be LHO's suit (while diamonds might be). |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


hc|s9|nt||ht|c|at|Dummy plays the 9 |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


lc|s9|pc|s9|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


pc|ss|at|and partner plays the deuce. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|What should that mean? |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|In "Standard," partner tells you if he likes or dislikes the suit you've led. |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


at|If low is discouraging, you can assume he doesn't like spades. |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


up|2|pc|s6|nt||ht|c|at|If you play the opposite way, assume partner played the 6 (high would be discouraging). |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |

pg| ***** 30 ***** |


pc|d|at|partner discards the @D2. |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


at|What is that? |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|In Standard, he is telling you his attitude about diamonds. |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


up|d2|pc|d8|at|Low discourages (if you play the opposite way, then he would play the @D8-this is called "Upside Down Attitude" in America, but is actually Standard in most other countries. Confusing, I know). |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


up|1|pc|d2cq|nt||ht|c|at|Declarer puts up the @CQ and since a hold up can't do much good, |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


hc|ca|at|you might as well take your ace. |

nt||cq|1|lb|*CWhat would you play? ^^h2^c5dth2s7|at|Partner doesn't like spades or diamonds, so let's try a heart. |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


sk|y|nt||ht|c|at|Full deal:|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


hs|nh|nt||ht|c|at|As you can see from the full deal, partner will cash 5 heart tricks to defeat the contract 2 tricks. |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


ls|nh|at|Why didn't partner give you a clearer signal by throwing an encouraging heart? |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


up|3|pc|h9|nt||ht|c|at|A heart signal would have been with a trick. |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


up|1|pc|d2|at|By discouraging spades and diamonds, he trusted you to figure out the heart switch. |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


up|10|nt||ht|c|at|Did you validate your partner's confidence in you? |
pg| ***** 46 ***** |
