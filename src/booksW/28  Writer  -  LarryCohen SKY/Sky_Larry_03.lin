^-
|fp||at|In the first four weeks of this series (see previous two weeks)  we will be facing a preempt by partner. When your partner preempts, you have an easy decision. If you are interested in game (rare), then bid accordingly. But, if you are ^*Inot^*N interested in game, just raise to the level of your side's number of trumps.

pg| ***** 3 ***** |


mb|2s|nt||ht|c|at|At favorable vulnerability (white versus red), your partner deals and opens 2@s. |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


mb|d|at|RHO doubles and it is up to you.  |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||cq|3|lb|*mYour call is?^Pass~Redouble~3@s~4@s^4|nt||ht|c|at|Since you have no game interest, this is an easy decision. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Your side has 10 trumps, |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|so you should bid to the 10-trick level - bid 4@S |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


mb|4s|at|(Yes, it is game, but you are not bidding it to make game - it will surely be a good sacrifice if you are allowed to play there - and you are protected by the ^*BLAW of Total Tricks^*N). |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Your LHO does not look happy, |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


mb|5h|at| but decides to bid 5@H |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


mb|pp|at|which is passed back to you.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Are you done? |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


mb|5s|at|It could be right to bid 5@S |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


at|(especially if 5@H is making), |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


at|but a good rule of thumb is this: |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


at|Make your Law of Total Tricks bid, let the opponents guess and hope they are wrong. |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


ub|1|mb|p|nt||ht|c|at|Don't bid again.|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Lets' hop over to declarer's seat and play 5@H: |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


sk|a|pc|sa|nt||ht|c|at|The opening lead is the @SA and a very suitable dummy appears.  |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|As to South's decision to bid 5@H |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


at|- well, it would have been nice to bid only 4@H, |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


at|but they don't allow that over 4@S.|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|What should your trick-one thinking be?|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|At suit contracts, count LOSERS. |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


hs|nsss|at|Surely you have to lose a spade trick, |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


ls|nsss|hc|djt9832|at|the only way you can go down is if you lose TWO diamond tricks.|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


lc|djt9832|nt||ht|c|at|What is the right way to play this diamond suit?|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Proper is to take two finesses,  |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


hc|dkq|at|losing only when East has BOTH the king and queen.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


lc|dkq|nt||ht|c|at|Your chance of success is 75%. |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


pc|ss9s|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


pc|sk|nt||ht|c|at|LHO leads a second top spade |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


pc|ssh|at|and you ruff. |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Now what? |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|You have a sure line of play |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


at|- you won't even need a diamond honor to be onside.|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


hs|nhsh|nt||ht|c|at|You should draw trumps |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


ls|nhsh|pc|hhhah|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


hs|ncsc|at|and in the process ruff out the clubs.|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


ls|ncsc|pc|ccckc|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


pc|cccac|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


pc|cchc|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


hc|d32|nt||ht|c|at|Once the trumps and clubs are drawn you end in your hand to play a diamond towards dummy. |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


lc|d32|pc|dd|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


pc|dtdq|nt||ht|c|at|When West plays low you put in dummy's 10 |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


mc|11|at|and claim.|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


pc|dk|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


hs|edndsd|nt||ht|c|at|East has to either play another diamond |
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


ls|ndedsd|at|or give you a ruff-sluff; |
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


at|11 tricks either way.|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|This might look easy, |
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


at|but you'd be amazed at how many people will go down in 5@H. |
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Actually, there is a way to defeat it legitimately. |
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


up|24|nt||ht|c|at|At trick two, |
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


hs|wd|at|West has to shift to diamonds. |
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


ls|wd|pc|d|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


at|Declarer has to finesse, |
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


at|but at this early stage, East can win the diamond |
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


pc|ddqd|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


hs|es|at|and exit safely.|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


ls|es|pc|s|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|He sits back and gets a second diamond trick. |
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


up|5|nt||ht|c|at|How should West know? |
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|From the bidding, he expects declarer is ruffing the second spade. |
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


at|How would West find a diamond as opposed to a club shift? |
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


at|This is not easy. |
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


up|2|nt||ht|c|hc|s964|at|In general, East's signal at trick one is attitude (about spades). |
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


lc|s964|at|But, in this case, with the spades somewhat known, |
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


hc|sq|at|a high spade from East should ask for the highest-ranking side suit (diamonds). |
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


pc|sq|nt||ht|c|at|Maybe East could hit West over the head with the unusual play of the Spade QUEEN at trick one. |
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Maybe West would get the message. |
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


up|3|lc|sq|nt||ht|c|at|Anyway, this is pretty high-level stuff. |
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


at|I'm happy if East raises West's preempt to 4@S-easy to please. |
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Next week, we will get our fourth and final chance to "^*BFollow the LAW^*N" after partner preempts. |
