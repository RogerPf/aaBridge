pg| ***** 3 ***** |


mb|1h|at|your partner deals and opens 1@H. |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|You are about to respond 1@S, |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


mb|2s|at|but RHO surprises you by bidding 2@S himself! |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|What should you do?|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|The first thing to do is remain calm. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|Don't make faces. Don't ask questions. Don't look surprised. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|Even if you are playing on-line, try to keep a poker face.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|The one thing you cannot say is "double." |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


at|You play negative doubles-for better or for worse. If you double, your partner will not know to pass. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|When playing negative doubles, you can have your cake and eat it, too. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


mb|pp|at|As long as you manage to pass without giving away the show, |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


mb|dp|at|your partner is likely to reopen the bidding with a takeout double. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Any time he has shortness in their suit (even with a minimum), he should double to cater to your having a penalty pass. |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


at|If you don't have spades, you'll take out the double and hopefully survive. |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


mb|p|an|Penalty|nt||ht|c|at|Here, you are delighted to convert the double for penalties |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


mb|pp|at|and 2@SX is the final contract.|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|What should you lead? |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt||cq|3|lb|*CWhat do you play now? ^^h4^s4h4c3d4|nt||ht|c|at|This one is easy. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Two rules both point to the same conclusion.  |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


at|One: Against a trump contract, when in doubt, lead a singleton in a side suit. |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


at|Two: Lead partner's suit. |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


pc|h|nt||ht|c|at|So, you lead a heart and see:|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


hc|h6|nt||ht|c|at|On the first trick dummy plays low, |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


lc|h6|pc|h|at|partner the nine |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


pc|h9|at|and declarer wins the ace. |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


pc|ha|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


pc|d|nt||ht|c|at|Next comes a diamond. |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


hs|ed|at|Which one do you play? |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


ls|ed|nt||ht|c|at|This is a situation for count, and in "standard count," low shows an odd number in the suit. |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


hc|d4|at|Since you have three of them (an odd number), you play a low diamond. |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


lc|d4|pc|d4dq|at|Most of you probably got that right just by playing closest to your mouse. |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


pc|da|nt||ht|c|at|Partner captures dummy's queen with the ace |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


pc|hj|at|and plays the @HJ next. |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


pc|h|at|Declarer follows low.|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|What is the heart situation and what is partner trying to tell you? |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


at|You know that partner has the KQJ9 in hearts (since the 9 forced the ace at the first trick). |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


at|Why is he playing back his lowest from KQJ? |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|He is giving you a suit preference signal to tell you he has a high club. |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|If he didn't have the @CA he would play the @HK (of course, you have to trust he knows what he is doing). |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


at|What will you do? |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


hs|ed|nt||ht|c|at|You might as well throw a diamond |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


ls|ed|pc|dh|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


at|- and hope to throw a diamond on another heart. |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


pc|hqh|nt||ht|c|at|Sure enough, another heart comes (the queen) |
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


pc|dh|at|and you throw another diamond. |
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


pc|dd|at|Now, partner gives you a diamond ruff. |
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


pc|sd|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|After you ruff, what next? |
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


at|Partner has signaled you for clubs, he must have the ace. |
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


hc|ck|at|You could lay down the king first, |
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


lc|ck|pc|ck|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


at|but it isn't like to make a difference. |
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


up|1|at|Let's say you lead a low club to partner's ace. |
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


pc|cccac|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


pc|hk|nt||ht|c|at| Now comes another high heart |
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


pc|c|at|on which declarer throws a club. |
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


hc|c8|at|You also throw a club. |
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


lc|c8|pc|ch|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Isn't this fun? |
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


pc|s|at|Partner now plays a spade |
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


pc|sksas|at|to declarer's king and your ace. |
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|If you are counting, you know declarer is down to all trumps. |
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


hs|ec|at|It can't hurt to exit in clubs. |
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


ls|ec|pc|ckcc|
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


pc|s|nt||ht|c|at|Declarer ruffs |

pc|s|at|forcing declarer to ruff. |
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


sk|y|nt||ht|c|at|You still get another trump trick for down 4, +1100. |
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


up|44|nt||ht|c|at|That will teach North to get frisky against you!|
