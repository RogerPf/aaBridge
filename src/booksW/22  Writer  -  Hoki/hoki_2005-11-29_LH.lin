nt|Would I double with the East cards?
|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


at|
It's certainly a bid worth considering. My partner and I were E-W on this hand - and partner decided to pass.|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|What a double has going for it: the vulnerability, the shape of the hand.
|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


at|
What is not so nice about a double is: three points in clubs|
hc|cQJ|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


at| may not be pulling their full weight, maybe one club too many instead of an extra red card. So it's 50-50.|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


nt|Let's say that a double is not wrong, but since it doesn't affect the outcome here I'll just go along with a gentle pass (also not wanting to put my partner off her bidding - since she's sitting in the gallery today).|
lc|cQJ|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |

nt|A bid of 3@D by South would be my way of checking whether partner has raised to 2@S on three-card or four-card support.|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


at| Here, though, South has five spades|
hc|sKT854|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |

nt|4@S is a reasonable contract but it may well fail because of the 4-0 trump split.

Q: No Dbl by West?
|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


at|
A: NO WAY - please excuse my shouting.|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


nt|I double for penalty only when I can see the contract going two down. That way, if one trick gets lost in the wash, we are still okay.
|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


at|
I should set up those last two comments as a macro - since I have to make them every week, lol.
|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


nt|The idea is that if you can get the opps down, you are heading for a good score anyway.
|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


at|
At the same time, a double tells them how to handle the trump suit.
|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


nt|West has only two sure tricks - I would need five tricks before I double.|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


at|  Even if partner had doubled 2@S, I would play partner for two more tricks, giving us a total of four on defence.|
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


at| I would not wish to jeopardise a score of +50 in the hope of increasing that to +100 when it risks achieving a result of -590. The simple odds are way against that being a good move.|
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


pc|HT|
nt|In fact, BBO declarer misplayed the trumps. It was great to see that today's BIL declarer handled the trumps correctly.|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


at| I also very much liked our volunteer's opening lead. It's a tough hand to lead from.|
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


at| A red card looks right - and from three to an honour I would lead small. But it's debatable whether a 10 should be counted as an honour card or not. I feel that a small heart  would really promise a picture card in the suit.|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


nt|Our volunteer declarer put too many eggs in one basket by ducking this in dummy.|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


at| If West had held four hearts to the @hQ, a small heart lead would have been much more likely. Only if West holds Q-10-9-[x] is the @h10 the right lead.|
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


pc|HK|
nt|So let's win this one in dummy.
What should East play? We play standard carding.|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


at| 
Very, very briefly: high is encouraging and low is discouraging.
|
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


at|
Come to think of it, that is also the long version.|
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


pc|H9|
nt|So a high @h (as high as East can afford) says that she likes @h.|
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


pc|H3|
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


nt|Our declarer now played the @sA off dummy - and that is always wrong. Whichever way you decide to play trumps, it is mostly correct to start with a small one - playing towards an honour.|
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


pc|S3|

Our volunteer did that very well here - by leading the @s3 off dummy.|

nt|What card should West play?
|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


at|Kibitzer: Ace
And why, please?
...
Two reasons for going up with the ace - both lie in the cards partner (East) has played.|
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


nt|In particular, the @h9 (showing the @hQ) at trick one must work as an encouragement for a heart continuation.
|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


at|Then partner has discarded the @c2, so declarer (too) knows that East does not have the @cA.|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


pc|CA|pc|C5|pc|C3|
at|
Of course, it looks as if it makes no difference whether we take the ace or not - since declarer now gets a pitch for the losing @h.|

nt|Maybe it's not a good idea for East to discard a @d - but the other options may also backfire.
|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


at|With South having pitched a high @h, it's clear that South is now out of hearts. So a @h discard is safe.|

nt|Wow, wonderful: 4@S bid and made.
|
pg| ***** 100 ***** |


at|
Anyway, our declarer made 4@S even by misplaying trumps. When I ducked the club play, it was all over - because the @d10 drops on the third round of @d, making declarer's @d9 a good card.|

nt|I propagate playing sound overcalls - bidding on hands that are close to an opening bid.|
pg| ***** 132 ***** |


at|

Remember, it is not easy to lose hands and tournaments by passing.|
pg| ***** 133 ***** |


nt|The unusual 2NT shows at least 5-5 in the two lower unbid suits (@d and @h). However, those suits should be respectable.|
pg| ***** 134 ***** |


hc|sKcKJ|
at|  The South hand in play here today has most of its values hidden in the black suits.|
pg| ***** 135 ***** |


lc|sKcKJ|
at|  2NT might still have been an attractive option at favourable vulnerability. But this is the worst vulnerability imaginable, so the thought of bidding 2NT would not even enter my mind.|
pg| ***** 136 ***** |


at||
mb|p|
sk|W|mb|1D|
pg| ***** 137 ***** |


sk|N|
nt|If North wanted to show a weak two-suiter after this start to the auction, the best way if the suits were spades and hearts (the two unbid suits) is via a "sandwich" 1NT overcall -  at least 5-5 in the two unbid suits.|
pg| ***** 138 ***** |


at|  However, clubs have been bid - so North can not show a two-suiter including clubs.|
pg| ***** 139 ***** |


nt|Maybe a weak jump overcall of 2@S is the best that North can do.
|
pg| ***** 140 ***** |


mb|2S|
at|
Once the opponents have bid @c semi-naturally, you can't show six spades and five clubs anymore.|
pg| ***** 141 ***** |


sk||
mb|2N|
nt|Q: How do you know how good West’s diamonds are in order to justify bidding 2NT?
|
pg| ***** 142 ***** |


at|
A: East's points are all in controls (aces) rather than quacks and spaces.
West has bid 1@D, so East knows that partner can stop diamonds.|
pg| ***** 143 ***** |


nt|If West has only 6 points, 2NT may only be one down while 2@S is sure to make.
|
pg| ***** 144 ***** |


at|
If West is very weak with long diamonds, West can retreat to 3@D - so 2NT is not too unreasonable.|
pg| ***** 145 ***** |


nt|Q: West could have xxx xx Kxxxx Kxx. With xx in diamonds East’s 2NT bid looks dangerous?
|
pg| ***** 146 ***** |


at|
A: As I said, East has key cards (aces) and when bidding under pressure you sometimes have to take a position. If they can make 2S, then one or two down in 2NT should not be a disaster.|
pg| ***** 147 ***** |

nt|West has a good six-card suit and raises to game in the hope that the suit will run.
|
pg| ***** 149 ***** |


at|
Both East and West have stretched marginally to reach this rather thin game. Is it worth the chance when white?|
pg| ***** 150 ***** |


nt|Well exactly, each undertrick is only 50. So it must be worth going for +400 rather than conceding -140 which is what happened at our volunteer table.|
pg| ***** 151 ***** |


at|

Risking -100 (two down) must be worth the chance of gaining +400.|
pg| ***** 152 ***** |


nt|I hear: some of the teachers say in white not worth taking risks in red push as you gain more.
|
pg| ***** 153 ***** |


at|
That applies when it comes to deciding whether to bid game or not.|
pg| ***** 154 ***** |


at|
Here it is a question of selling out to 2@S or making one further attempt to win the bidding auction.|
pg| ***** 155 ***** |


nt|If East had passed 2@S, West would bid 3@D and East might then decide to take the bull by the horns and punt 3NT.|
pg| ***** 156 ***** |


at||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|
pg| ***** 157 ***** |


nt|Okay, now I hear: I meant the 3NT bid not the 2NT: with 2NT I agree - refers to taking a risk when white against red.|
pg| ***** 158 ***** |


at|
The six-card suit might mean six tricks - and surely that makes game a dead cert. 
East needs only have the @dJ for six tricks to be solid.|

nt|If you play the @dA (or the @d10) you are assured of four @D tricks. That plus three aces and the @hQ gives you a total of 8 tricks.

It is true that you can afford to lose one @d (you only need five @D tricks to make the contract), but you can afford to cater for the actual layout where the suit splits 5-0.|

nt|Now when North shows out, the situation is clear.|

If this trick had lost to North and the suit had split 4-1, you STILL get the rest of the diamonds - since South's remaining three diamonds all drop under the A-K-Q.|

Good try - thanks to all volunteers.|
pg| ***** 209 ***** |


nt|It was interesting to observe the developments at the volunteer table - both in the bidding and play.
|
pg| ***** 210 ***** |


at|
Starting off by attacking @c on defence made me wonder whether continued @c plays defeat 3NT (the E-W clubs are 3-3).
|
pg| ***** 211 ***** |


nt|I think after that start that it may need almost double dummy declarer play to allow South to cash @c - and then be endplayed in @h. South needs to find three discards on the run of the @d.|

nt|As West, I prefer to show the shape of my hand - essentially balanced - than rebid the @d. A diamond rebid in my book would tend to show either a sixth @d or a singleton somewhere.|

nt|While happy with notrumps (a balanced hand), East feels like checking back on whether West mightn't after all have three-card @h support.
|
pg| ***** 219 ***** |


at|

"New minor forcing" helps East do that.|
pg| ***** 220 ***** |


mb|2C@|an|new minor forcing|
nt|Such a bid must be alerted - as it does not necessarily promise a @c suit.
It is forcing on West to bid again.
|
pg| ***** 221 ***** |


at|
It appears that some tutors in the BIL call the 2@C bid "Checkback Stayman".|
pg| ***** 222 ***** |


nt|While we are agreed on the meaning (looking for three-card @h support), we disagree as to the terminology. In the US, this is always called "New minor forcing".
|
pg| ***** 223 ***** |


at|
I think the use of the term "Stayman" is very confusing since we use Stayman to explore for a 4-4 fit in the majors, which is not the case here.|

nt|2@D now shows the fifth @d and denies three @hs.
|
pg| ***** 226 ***** |


at|
In fact, West now confirms exactly a doubleton @h because with a singleton West would have rebid 2@D earlier.
|
pg| ***** 227 ***** |


nt|Note how this sequence tells East a lot more about West's hand than an initial 2@D rebid would have done.|

nt|With only a doubleton @s honour, South needs to "unblock" here.
|
pg| ***** 237 ***** |


at|
North's lead must be from Q-J-10 ... or Q-J-9, so South must get out of partner's way.
|

pc|SK|
at|
The king can't cost - and if West ducks, South can continue playing @s through declarer.|
pg| ***** 239 ***** |


nt|With the @s9 on view in dummy, South knows that North holds Q-J-10.
|
pg| ***** 240 ***** |

With Q-J-x-x-x the correct lead is a small one (against a NT contract) - the Q only against a suit contract.|

One to Kasey (for being first - knowing South has no more spades).|

One to Diana for a very good comprehensive reply.|

And one to D/Trafalgar for mentioning the "Rule of seven".|

pg| ***** 251 ***** |


cs|2|
at|
Then you subtract that number from  { 7 }  and that tells you how often to duck.
|
pg| ***** 252 ***** |

So 6 from 7 leaves one. You duck once.|
pg| ***** 253 ***** |


lc|sA83976|

nt|This assumes that the opening leader has started with a five-card suit.|
pg| ***** 254 ***** |


at|
If North had six @s, it would be even better because South would have had the king singleton - and would now have had to switch.|
pg| ***** 255 ***** |


at|
If we duck again, we'd need to worry about getting a @c switch and losing lots of @c tricks once the @h finesse fails.|
pg| ***** 256 ***** |


nt|However, without that knowledge I'd suggest ducking once is enough (and "normal"), so we'll win this trick and take the @h finesse.
|
pg| ***** 257 ***** |


at|
If the @h finesse (known in Europe as "impass") works, then we can expect to make quite a few overtricks.|

nt|So 3NT made two overtricks, but it's not that easy on a @c switch.
|
pg| ***** 268 ***** |


at|
Even so, it shows the value of ducking @s once - and noting the need for South to cover the @sQ opening lead.|
pg| ***** 269 ***** |


nt|Q: What happens if South switches to a club at trick 2?
|
pg| ***** 270 ***** |


at|
A: I agree that an immediate switch (South could play a @c at trick 2) makes declarer's task much harder.|
pg| ***** 271 ***** |


nt|DF (Deep Finesse) says 3NT still makes - since South has major discarding problems on the run of the @d suit.
|
pg| ***** 272 ***** |


at|
I think it's right for South to continue @s - maybe North held @DQ as an additional entry later. Maybe West would duck again?|
pg| ***** 273 ***** |


nt|So for the sake of partnership harmony, it can not be a gross blunder to continue playing partner's suit.|

nt|I'm over my time allocation anyway, but I am happy to finish off the explanations associated with this deal. It came from a late-night, high-stake team game and was reported by Martin Hoffman.|

nt|This is the sort of hand you might expect East to hold for such a dramatic action.|
mb|4H|
pg| ***** 300 ***** |


at|
This is a weak bid, whereas a jump to 2@H is a strong jump shift being almost slam forcing.|
pg| ***** 301 ***** |


at| The 4@H jump shows at least 7 cards (more usually 8) in @h - and almost no outside strength. It is a preemptive response, trying to keep N-S out of a @s game.|
pg| ***** 302 ***** |


nt|It doesn't matter whether you are preempting your partner or not. You are describing exactly this sort of hand.
|
pg| ***** 303 ***** |


sk|S|
at|
Now if West's clubs were hearts (almost impossible), then West is still entitled to explore for slam.|
pg| ***** 304 ***** |


sk||
nt|We normally don't like to be talked out of games and with such a good hand as this South one, 4@S can't be such a bad contract.
|
pg| ***** 305 ***** |


at|
Either it makes or is only one or two down, in which latter case 4@H would surely be making.|
pg| ***** 306 ***** |


mb|4S|
pg| ***** 307 ***** |


sk||
mb|p|mb|p|
pg| ***** 308 ***** |


nt|Using the same reasoning as South (either we'll be one down at the five level and 4@S makes - OR we'll make our five-level contract) I'd bid again. As East I would be most reluctant to sell out to 4@S.|
mb|5D|
pg| ***** 309 ***** |


nt|I hear some comments about 5@H.
|
pg| ***** 310 ***** |


at|
5@D offers more flexibility than 5@H. Obviously partner (West) has the option to correct to 5@H when that looks right.|
pg| ***** 311 ***** |


nt|I'm just making this suggestion since I don't believe it's right to let South play unmolested in 4@S.
|
pg| ***** 312 ***** |


at|
But actually I wanted to come back to our initial 4@S contract, which our volunteer declarer got so close to making.|

nt|This is NOT my recommendation!
|
pg| ***** 314 ***** |


at|
Remember, I believe you should have five tricks in your hand before making a penalty double.|
pg| ***** 315 ***** |


nt|But I'd just like to follow Martin Hoffman's article where in the actual late-night, high-stake game the West player believed a penalty double would work.|
pg| ***** 316 ***** |


mb|p|mb|p|
nt|As East I would still now bid 5@D or 5@H.
|
pg| ***** 317 ***** |


at|
That is why playing doubles as takeout, even at the four level, is probably a more useful tool than being just purely greedy and wanting blood.|
pg| ***** 318 ***** |


nt|On this hand, it is East-West's blood that is on the operating table.|
pg| ***** 319 ***** |


at|  Against 5@D by West, if N-S attack in the black suits, declarer can promote two heart tricks by taking a ruffing heart finesse against South and ruffing three black cards in dummy.|
pg| ***** 320 ***** |


mb|p|
nt|And this contract should make - or what says DF?
|
pg| ***** 321 ***** |


at|
Well, DF was right and wasn't.
|
pg| ***** 322 ***** |


nt|DF was not right because South should have made 4@S (except on double-dummy defence - underleading the A-K of diamonds!!!).
|
pg| ***** 323 ***** |


at|
DF was right because the declarer blew the play utterly - and went three down for -800.|
pg| ***** 324 ***** |


pc|DA|
nt|Leading the @dA is what allows the contract to make|
pg| ***** 325 ***** |


at|, but only someone who can see through the backs of the cards would know that a low diamond to partner's @dQ - and a heart switch is needed to defeat the contract.|

at|  We should, of course, have pulled one round of trumps earlier - just in case the suit was splitting 2-1.|
pg| ***** 332 ***** |
