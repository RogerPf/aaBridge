^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 227 - January 15, 2001 ^*N }
^-
We left you hanging last week as we were unable to find a "clearly correct approach" to the deal that was presented. We received about a dozen e-mails from our readers with suggestions concerning the best line of play in ^*BDeal for the Week 226^*N. Most of these e-mails contained some good points, but only France's ^*BVincent Labbe^*N was able to provide us with a sense of closure on this difficult deal. Vincent works for ^*BLe Bridgeur^*N magazine, one of the most respected bridge publications in the world, so it is no surprise that he was able to find the line that he did.

We will present a summary of Vincent's approach soon, but make sure you keep reading after that! Later in this week's deal is the answer to a suit combination problem that we posed to those of you who receive ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N by e-mail. Finally we will present a deal that ^*BBill Barkley^*N played very well. Thanks to Bill for sending us this deal and for all of our readers that took the trouble to e-mail us their thoughts concerning last week's deal.

ls|sd|up|43|hs|ec|nt|Vincent's analysis went even further, but given that this was last week's deal we are going to move on now. It is sufficient to note that the line of play just presented will make the contract as long as East has no more than 3 clubs (presuming that there is only 1 trump loser). Given East's 1@D opening, we like this approach very much. Thanks Vincent for sharing your analysis with us!|

Those of you who receive ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N by e-mail were presented with this suit combination last week and a promise that the solution would be presented in this week's deal. If you are not interested in these sorts of problems please skip over the next few pages in order to see the deal that Bill Barkley sent us.

You must play this suit for 2 losers. When you lead the @S2 from the dummy East follows with the @S10 or @S9. Do you play the @SK or the @SJ from your hand? You can assume the defenders play (and falsecard) perfectly as this problem is impossible to solve accurately if "human factors" (such as the possibility of misdefense) are taken into account.

To begin with, your play is irrelevant if spades are 5-1 or 6-0. If spades are 3-3 you are on a complete guess - the @SK will be the winning play if East has @SAxx and the @SJ will be the winning play if East has @SQxx. The 4-2 breaks are the key to solving this problem. Furthermore, it is only when East has 2 cards in the suit that your play will matter.

Suppose you try the @SK and it loses to the @SA with West. Your only remaining chance will be that East was dealt the doubleton @S109 (you can continue by leading the @SJ on the second round).

If instead you try the @SJ on the first round, you will still pick up the @S109 doubleton with East, but you will also succeed when East was dealt a doubleton @SQ10 or @SQ9. This suggests that the @SJ is the correct play on the first round of the suit.

Unfortunately this problem is more complicated as it is correct for East to falsecard with the @SQ on the first round when he is dealt a doubleton @SQ10 or @SQ9, playing the same card as he would from doubleton @SAQ! Furthermore, when you cover East's @SQ with the @SK, West should duck from @SA10xx or @SA9xx in order to give you a chance to go wrong (by ducking the second round - playing East for doubleton @SAQ).|

Declarer should not be fooled by this strong defense as there is only 1 @SAQ doubleton, but 2 holdings of @SQ10 and @SQ9 doubleton. It is still correct to cover the @S10 or @S9 with the @SJ on the first round of the suit. In a perfect world, however, when the @SQ is played and the @SK holds, declarer should continue by leading the @SJ on the second round. The only relevant holding that this plan loses to is a doubleton @SAQ with East, whereas playing the @SK on the first round loses to doubleton @SQ10 and @SQ9 with East.

East could have given West a diamond ruff at trick 2 to defeat the contract, but he did not know whether Bill or West was dealt a singleton diamond. East thought the defense was likely to prevail even without a diamond ruff.|
