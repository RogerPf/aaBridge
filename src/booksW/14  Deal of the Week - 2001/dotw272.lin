^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 272 - November 26, 2001^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played by both ^*BBridge Base^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N and Vice President ^*BSheri Winestock^*N during the first semi-final session of the Reisinger Board-A-Match Teams during the ACBL Fall North American Championships in Las Vegas. The deal has been rotated to make South the declarer.

In board-a-match scoring (like in matchpoints) overtricks are very important. The contract and the opening lead were the same when Fred and Sheri played this deal, but Sheri had a more difficult time winning the maximum number of tricks due to the stronger defense that she received.

We are happy to report that Fred (along with partner ^*BBrad Moss^*N and teammates ^*BRoy Welland^*N-^*BBjorn Fallenius^*N and ^*BHoward Weinstein^*N-^*BSteve Garner^*N) ended up winning the 2001 Reisinger! This was Fred's first victory in one of the major North American Championship events after coming close a few times (including second place finishes in both the 2001 Spingold and the 1999 Life Masters Pairs).

Winning is always fun, but unfortunately this year's Reisinger was decided by a very complex appeal between Fred's team and the (mostly Italian) team captained by ^*BGeorge Jacobs^*N. In a very sporting gesture, George and Roy Welland (the captain of Fred's team) agreed to declare the result of the contentious deal a tie, but the Tournament Directors could not allow that according to the conditions of contest. The appeal had a happy ending for Fred and his team, but it is always a shame when a bridge tournament has to be decided in this way. We would like to thank the Jacobs team for being such good sports about the whole thing.

nt|Although Fred knew that only one defender (the one who held heart length) could be squeezed on this deal, his line of play involved what was essentially a double squeeze (because it would work regardless of whether East |

nt|One necessary characteristic of both simple and double squeezes is that both of these positions will operate only if the declarer has exactly 1 loser remaining. At Fred's table East rectified the count to 1 loser for Fred when he won the @CA. |

up|4|md|0,ct,,hj|hs|wc|ls|sc|at|At the point where Sheri exited in clubs, there was a concern that West might have been dealt the @C10 and would be able to win the rest of the tricks. Do you know why Sheri was able to read the end position with reasonable confidence?|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


hs|eh|nt|Actually there were a few reasons. First of all, if clubs had been 3-3 all along then East would have been dealt 5 hearts and he probably would have discarded from that suit early in the play. |
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


ls|eh|at|Second, Sheri knew that the odds were on her side - 5404 is a more common pattern than 5503 (check the ^*BOfficial Encyclopedia of Bridge^*N for the odds of various hand patterns). |
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


md|0ct,c2|hs|sc|nt|Finally, Sheri suspected that East would not discard the @CA as East could not know whether Sheri or West had been dealt the @C10. If Sheri had been dealt that card then discarding the @CA would present Sheri with all 13 tricks and a certain losing board for East-West. |
