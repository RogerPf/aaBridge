^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 238 - April 2, 2001 ^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played by our good friend ^*BGeoff Hampson^*N during an early round of the recent Vanderbilt Knockout Teams at the ACBL Spring NABC in Kansas City. Full coverage of this tournament, including ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N of the Vanderbilt final, is available through:

Geoff was playing with his regular partner, ^*BEric Greco^*N, when this week's deal was played. Geoff is still in his early 30s, but he has already established himself as one of the most successful professional players in the ACBL. Eric is even younger than Geoff and together they form one of the best young pairs in the world today. In this week's deal Geoff made use of both his strong technical skills and excellent table presence to bring home a difficult slam contract.

In last week's deal we left you with a declarer play problem. The solution to that problem will be presented at the end of this week's deal. 

A new computer program is now available that we think will be of interest to OKBridge players as well as serious students of the game. The name of this program is ^*BBRidgeBRowser^*N (^*BBRBR^*N for short) and it was developed by ^*BStephen Pickett^*N, a very experienced programmer and online bridge player from Vancouver, Canada

^*BBRidgeBRowser^*N is a Windows program that acts as a searchable database of bridge deals. This program is capable of managing a database of over 18,000,000 deal records that were played on OKBridge over the past 3 years (representing over 250,000 deals that were each played between 50 and 100 times). To the best of our knowledge, this is by far the biggest database ever assembled of duplicate bridge play records.

The most impressive feature of ^*BBRBR^*N is how quickly and easily this program allows the user to search this mass of data using various criteria. Searches can be performed according to which players were involved, the contract, vulnerability, high card points, final result, and any combination of these (and several other) factors. A few seconds after such a query is made, ^*BBRBR^*N starts to list the records from its database that match the conditions that the user specificied. The user can then examine the matching deal records in detail and/or export them to various file formats (including text and .pbn) for later study. Once the user has defined a subset of the records in the database ^*BBRBR^*N is extremely fast when it comes to searching through that subset (obviously it takes longer to search through an entire 18,000,000 record database).

Regulars on OKBridge can use ^*BBRBR^*N to track their own results and the effect that these results have on their Lehman ratings. They can also use ^*BBRBR^*N to see how other players (including the many world class players who use OKBridge) handled the same deals. Bridge players who are interested in analysis will find ^*BBRBR^*N's  powerful search facilities to be useful in determining which bridge strategies and bidding agreements are effective in real life play.

^*BBRBR^*N in a very complex program with many functions, but its user interface is well designed and intuitive to use. The program comes with extensive and well written help files. The only warning we have about this program is that storing the records of millions of bridge deals can take up a lot of hard disk space. Given the usefulness of the information in the ^*BBRBR^*N database, we think that many bridge players will find that these are megabytes well spent.

Geoff would soon play on hearts, but he chose to play on this suit in a most unusual manner. Can you see how Geoff played the hearts and why he chose to do so?|

hs|eh|hs|wh|nt|Those of you who are at all mathematically inclined will realize that Geoff's line of play on this deal was well against the odds (as compared to leading a heart toward the @HQ at the critical point). Geoff knew this too, of course, but he correctly judged that East was a strong favorite to hold long hearts headed by the @HK. Can you see how Geoff figured this out?|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt|Geoff thought that it was very strange that East chose to discard a heart on the third round of trump. Geoff's play of cashing a second high spade before playing a third round of trump made the spade layout very obvious to the defense. He correctly judged that East did not discard a spade because East didn't have any more spades to discard!|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt|When East later turned up with 4 diamonds, it looked very much like East had been dealt 2542 distribution. If this was the case then Geoff's line was roughly twice as likely to succeed than the obvious alternative of leading a low heart toward the @HQ on the first round of that suit. |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt|Of course, it was always possible that East was playing a very deep game and that he had discarded a heart for the purposes of giving Geoff a losing alternative. Fortunately, there are not too many defenders that play that well. Otherwise the Geoff Hampsons of the world would find it much harder to make a living playing bridge!|

pg| ***** 34 ***** |


pc|sk|at|West's opening lead is the @SK. Think about how you would play as declarer. An unusual hint: the defenders are using standard signals on defense.|

pg| ***** 38 ***** |


ls|sh|pc|h4|pc|h7|hs|nh|at|Furthermore, when West follows small, we think that it is correct to finesse dummy's @H9! |

ls|nh|pc|h9|sk||hs|eh|hs|wh|
at|This unusual play would have worked very well, given the actual layout of the heart suit when this deal was dealt in the NABC Swiss Teams in Kansas City. |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|The first thing you should realize is that East has the @HA. West would have opened 1@S, not 3@S, if he had been dealt the @HA in addition to a strong 7-card spade suit. The next thing you should realize is that running all of your trumps immediately is not going to accomplish anything. You can try this out yourself at the end of our analysis of this deal.


|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|It is easy to look at the East-West hearts and say that West ^*Ishould^*N split his honors on the first round of the suit, but the fact is that defenders usually signal honestly in situations like this. There is a good chance that your typical West, playing standard signalling methods, will give correct count from @HJ10x if you play a heart at trick 2. |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


ls|wh|ls|eh|md|0,dq,,c3|hs|wd|hs|ed|nt|Granted that the @H9 is not particularly likely to force the @HA, but the recommended play has almost nothing to lose. If the @DQ is doubleton then the heart suit is irrelevant - South will not have any diamond losers and he will not need dummy's hearts to provide a discard. |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |

ls|ed|hs|eh|nt|Even if the @DQ is singleton, South will be able to recover if the @H9 loses to the @HJ or @H10. |
