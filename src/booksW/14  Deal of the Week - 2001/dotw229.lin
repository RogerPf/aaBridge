^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 229 - January 29, 2001 ^*N }

The ^*BCap Gemini Ernst & Young World Top Invitational Pairs^*N is often referred to as "The Wimbledon of Bridge". This event is held every January at the beautiful ^*BHotel Des Indes^*N in The Hague, The Netherlands. The organizers of the Cap Gemini invite 16 world class partnerships to compete in this event each year and the field is always very strong.

Full coverage of the 2001 Cap Gemini, including ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N of every deal at all 8 tables, is available through:

This year's Cap Gemini was the 15th running of this event. For the first time in history the defending champions, ^*BZia Mahmood^*N and ^*BAndrew Robson^*N, were able to retain the title. The fact that Zia and Andrew are not a regular partnership makes this accomplishment all the more impressive.

Zia and Andrew share several characteristics that we admire very much. They are both natural bidders and great card players and they have both contributed a great deal toward helping to publicize bridge. You have to be a highly competitive person to succeed in the international bridge circuit, but Zia and Andrew are still able to be courteous and fun with both their partners and their opponents.

nt|Zia Mahmood has the reputation (which he fully deserves) of being one of the trickiest and most creative bridge players in the history of the game. This week's deal is a good example of the type of magic that Zia is capable of at the bridge table. This deal was from the final round of the 2001 Cap Gemini when Zia and Andrew faced ^*BKrzysztof Jassem^*N and ^*BPiotr Tuszynski^*N of Poland. Jassem-Tuszynski are one of the great partnerships in the world today. Last week's deal was played by Jassem in the 2001 Cap Gemini. If you have not seen last week's deal yet you should definitely have a look after you have finished with this week's deal!

At the time that this week's deal was played, Zia and Andrew held a slim lead over Americans ^*BHoward Weinstein^*N and ^*BSteve Garner^*N in the standings of the Cap Gemini. The 12 IMP swing that went to Zia and Andrew on this deal was critical in allowing the defending champions to hold on to first place. This deal has been rotated to make South the declarer.

We are pleased to announce that a new set of extra deals is now available for ^*BBridge Master 2000^*N, a highly acclaimed educational software product that was developed by ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N The new set of deals is entitled ^*BD2^*N and it consists of 30 instructional deals from the second difficulty level of ^*BBridge Master^*N. Level 2 hands are too easy for most of regular readers of ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N, but we also sell several sets of extra deals at the higher skill levels (including the recently released sets ^*BD3^*N, ^*BD4^*N, and ^*BC5^*N).

Click on the yellow rectangle below to find out more about  ^*BBridge Master 2000^*N and to download a free demo version. If you appreciate the free online content we provide (like ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N and ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N) you can support these efforts by purchasing our software.

pg| ***** 8 ***** |


sk||hs|es|hs|ws|hs|eh|hs|wh|hs|ed|hs|wd|nt|As you can see by the very friendly lie of the defenders' spades, hearts, and diamonds, any reasonable line would have met with success. Given that we told you that Zia and Andrew won a sizable swing on this deal, you probably figured out that they found a way to defeat 6@S. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ls|es|ls|ws|ls|eh|ls|wh|ls|ed|ls|wd|nt|Tuszynski is a very careful player and he certainly did not do anything stupid as the declarer on this deal. Instead, the defense found a way to lead him astray. With all the cards in view, can you think of any logical sequence of plays that would lead to 6@S going down?|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


hs|ss|nt|Tuszynski made a very reasonable play when he started by laying down a high trump from his hand. |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


ls|ss|pc|SK|hs|ws|at|Zia immediately recognized that this trick presented him an opportunity to execute a classic swindle so he dropped the @SJ under Tuszynski's @SK!|

pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt|^*BTerrence Reese's^*N writings on falsecards from holdings like J9 and Q10 doubleton are well known to every serious student of the game. Tuszynski knew that Zia was capable of the playing the @SJ from his actual holding, but even at the highest levels, you don't see falsecards like this happen very often in the heat of battle. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


hs|ed|hs|wd|hs|sd|hs|nd|nt|Tuszynski thus decided to take Zia's @SJ at face value. He realized that, assuming the @SJ was really a singleton, there was a line of play available that would ensure the contract as long as the defenders' diamonds were divided no worse than 4-2. |

hs|sd|hs|ns|at|When both followed, Tuszynski thought he was home. He ruffed the third round of diamonds with dummy's @SA to establish that suit in case the East-West diamonds had been divided 4-2. |

hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|Tuszynski then returned to his hand by finessing the @S8, fully expecting to be able to claim the rest of the tricks when that finesse won. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|pc|S3|pc|S6|pc|S8|

hs|ws|at|As you can see, Zia was able to win the @S9 to take the setting trick for the defense! |

mc|11|nt|Declarer claimed the rest of the tricks, but the damage had been done. The swing that Zia and Andrew won on this deal was enough to ensure the second straight Cap Gemini championship for this pair. You can bet that Zia, who lives for winning bridge tournaments and for tricking the opponents (among other things), was one happy man after this deal!|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|up|27|nt|Only 2 of the other 8 pairs who held the North-South cards when this deal was played in the Cap Gemini managed to reach the good 6@S slam. |
