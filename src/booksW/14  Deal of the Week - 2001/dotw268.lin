^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 268 - October 29, 2001^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played by ^*BSimon de Wijs^*N, a young Dutch star, in the round robin phase of this year's ^*BTransfer Solutions Meesterklasse^*N tournament. Simon's partner was ^*BBauke Muller^*N, a member of the Dutch team that won the 1993 Bermuda Bowl World Championships. The deal has been rotated to make South the declarer.

The Meesterklasse tournament is the official yearly Dutch Team Championships. 12 teams from various parts of The Netherlands qualify to play in this event. These teams play a complete qualifying round robin followed by a knockout phase to determine the champions. The finals of this year's Meesterklasse will take place in December. Complete coverage of this event, including ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N, will be available through:

Although Simon is still in his 20s, he already has an impressive bridge resume.

He won the 1999 edition of the Meesterklasse. Simon works as a computer programmer, but he is also an accomplished bridge journalist.|

sk|s|nt|Simon was dealt the South cards with only his side vulnerable (you can tell who is vulnerable by the graphic in the top left of the diagram above - red means vulnerable, white means not vulnerable). West dealt and opened 3@C. Bauke doubled for takeout and Simon contented himself with 3@D - a good decision as it turns out as the alternative of 4@D might not have worked well. |

ls|sd|hs|ss|mb|P|mb|3H|mb|P|mb|3S|

nt|Bauke showed a strong hand by correcting to 3@H and Simon chose to improvise with 3@S, hoping that Bauke would bid 3NT. Simon realized that this call was not without risk, but he took some solace in the fact that he would have usually bid 3@S in preference to 3@D if he had been dealt a 4-card spade suit (even with longer diamonds).|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


mb|P|mb|4S|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|nt|When Bauke raised to 4@S, Simon chose to pass and 4@S became the final contract. As it turns out, Simon's pass was another excellent decision, but he was going to have to play his cards very well in order for his bidding judgment to be rewarded. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


ls|ss|pc|H8|
hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|West's opening lead was the @H8. Simon must have been quite pleased with his contract when Bauke's dummy came down. 4@S appeared to be by far the best game contract on the North-South cards. Think about how you would play this deal as declarer before reading on. |

pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt|The early play had marked West with only 2 red suit cards (both hearts). Furthermore, it was clear that the @CA and the @CK were split as West would have laid down a high club at some point if he has been dealt both high honors. Simon knew that the defense could have defeated 4@S by taking 2 club tricks and a second diamond ruff. Watch how he made the defense pay for this error.|

pg| ***** 37 ***** |


ls|ed|ls|eh|hs|wc|at|A winkle is a squeeze that takes place with at least 2 losers in a suit which the defense is forced to block, leaving declarer in a position to either build a trick in that suit or to arrive at a successful endplay position. |

nt|Note that after West made the mistake of exiting in hearts (instead of taking 2 club tricks and a second diamond ruff), Simon played his cards in the only manner that would allow him to make his contract on the actual layout. |
