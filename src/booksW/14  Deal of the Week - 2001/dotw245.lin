^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 245 - May 21, 2001 ^*N }
^-
|cs|1|at|^-{ ^*BSPECIAL!!! There are 2 Deals of the Week this week!^*N }
^-
Both deals are declarer play problems that took place at the recent ^*BCavendish Invitational Pairs^*N tournament in Las Vegas. To the best of our knowledge, only 3 declarers at the Cavendish solved the first problem and nobody solved the second problem. See if you can do better.

^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N has recently launched a new online bridge service named ^*BBridge Base Online^*N (BBO). You can download a program to install BBO on your PC through:

|cs|2|at|^-{ ^*Hwww.bridgebase.com/online^*N }
^-
Clicking on the blue rectangle above will take you directly to the BBO download page in a new browser window.

BBO is very different from any of the other existing online bridge services. Playing online bridge is just one of the many features that BBO has to offer. Some of BBO's other features are a ^*BBridge Library^*N where you can read various articles about bridge (including almost 100 past ^*BDeals of the Week^*N), a ^*BVugraph Theatre^*N where you can watch the trick-by-trick play of dozens of major tournaments, a ^*BPartnership Bidding^*N area where you can practice bidding constrained random hands with your partner, and ^*BChat Rooms^*N that are specifically designed for talking about bridge.

You, South, deal and Pass. West opens 1@S, your partner doubles and East raises preemptively to 3@S. You are playing IMPs and only your side is vulnerable. Would you bid 4@H or Pass?|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


nt||lb|*MWhat call would you make as South?^4 Hearts~Pass^1|mb|4h|nt|We think it is pretty clear to bid 4@H here. The knowledge that partner has at most a singleton spade has made your hand much better. Think about some random hands for partner with 1444 distribution and only 11 HCP or so and you will see that it doesn't take much to make 4@H an attractive proposition (especially vulnerable at IMPs).|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|If you pass here there are many hands in which partner will not have the strength to reopen and 4@H will be either laydown or very good. The fact that any finesses you might require rate to be working is another reason to bid aggressively in this position. Don't worry about partner burying you for bidding 4@H - he knows that this is a pressure situation.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


ls|sh|mb|P|mb|4N|mb|P|mb|5D|mb|P|mb|6H|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|
nt|OK - so it is possible that partner will bury you if you bid 4@H. On the actual deal it is entirely possible that partner will drive to slam via Blackwood. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


pc|SQ|at|That may not be such a bad thing, however, as 6@H is a pretty reasonable contract (especially given the bidding which marks the @CK with West). West's opening lead is the @SQ. Think about how you would play before reading on.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


sk||hs|eh|hs|wh|nt|Given that West must have almost all of the outstanding high cards for his opening bid, East likely has a singleton somewhere to justify his 3@S call. East's singleton is most likely to be in hearts (because North-South have more combined cards in hearts than any other suit). You should plan to finesse West for the @HJ on the second round of trump. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|ls|eh|ls|wh|hs|ns|hs|ss|
nt|It would be an unnecessary risk to overtake dummy's @SK with your @SA in order to take a first round finesse against the @HJ (as you would lose to a singleton @HJ with East). It is certainly correct to win dummy's @SK at trick 1, |

nt|In this week's second deal ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N found himself in 3NT after opening 1NT as South. Fred's partner, ^*BBrad Moss^*N, had bid 2@C Stayman along the way, doubled by East to suggest a club opening lead. |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


pc|C8|
hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|West obediently led the @C8 and, although Brad put down a nice dummy, 3NT was far from laydown. It looked like Fred would have to develop a second spade trick to make 3NT and prevent the defenders from winning 5 tricks in the process. Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on.|

nt|Fred did not play this deal correctly (neither did anyone else in the Cavendish as far as we know). His line of play was interesting, however, so we will show you how he went down. Fred knew that  ducking the first round of clubs was out of the question as a heart shift would leave him with very little chance. He therefore chose to win dummy's @CK |

nt|It is not 100% clear that declarer would always read the position after finding the fine play of a low spade toward the dummy at trick 2, but we expect that most declarers in the Cavendish would be able to work things out after passing the first hurdle. To the best of our knowlege nobody made 3NT on this deal. Note that after a heart opening lead 3NT has no chance on the actual layout.|
