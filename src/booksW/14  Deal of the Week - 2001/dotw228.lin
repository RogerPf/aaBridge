^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 228 - January 22, 2001 ^*N }
^-
In the last few years ^*BKrzysztof Jassem^*N and ^*BPiotr Tuszynski^*N of Poland have emerged as one of the strongest pairs in the world. They played a key role when Poland won the Silver Medal in last year's World Teams Olympiad in Maasticht.

Poland has been one of the strongest bridge playing nations in the world for over 20 years. There are many great players from that country and several world class partnerships. Our friend Krzysztof Jassem is not only one of Poland's finest, he is also an excellent bridge journalist, has done some work on bridge web sites, and works as a professor of computer science.  Krzysztof is also responsible for distributing our ^*BBridge Master 2000^*N software product in Poland. If you are from Poland and if you are interested in getting a copy of this product, please e-mail  Krzysztof:

This week's deal was played by Jassem in the recent ^*BCap Gemini Ernst & Young World Top Invitational Pairs^*N in The Hague, The Netherlands. Jassem-Tuszynski faced ^*BWubbo De Boer^*N and ^*BBauke Muller^*N of The Netherlands when this week's deal was played. Jassem-Tuszynski finished a strong 3rd in this year's Cap Gemini (they were 3rd last year as well).

Third may not sound very special, but the Cap Gemini is widely considered the strongest invitational pairs event in the world. Only 16 pairs are invited to compete in the Cap Gemini and the organizers make a serious effort to ensure that they invite partnerships that are at the very top of world bridge. This year's Cap Gemini was the 15th running of the event and the winners, for the second year in a row, were ^*BZia Mahmood^*N (of no fixed address) and Great Britain's ^*BAndrew Robson^*N. Full coverage of this year's Cap Gemini, including ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N of every board at all 8 tables, is available through:

nt|Jassem, South, dealt and opened with a Polish 1@C (several possible hand types). The rest of the auction was entirely natural. Jassem ended up as declarer in 4@S after De Boer, West, had bid both minors and Muller, East, had raised clubs.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


pc|CK|hs|nc|hs|sc|nt|De Boer led the @CK and Tuszynski's values were such that 4@S was far from laydown, especially since the bidding suggested that suits would be breaking badly. The @CK held the first trick |

pg| ***** 9 ***** |


sk||hs|ns|hs|ss|hs|es|nt|Jassem was not taken in by the fact that the trump finesse had won. The bidding suggested that Muller probably held long spades headed by the @SK. This was actually the case and it would have been fatal for Jassem to play a second round of trump at this point. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|ls|es|nt|Even with all 4 hands in view it is not easy to see how declarer can come to 10 tricks, but Jassem found the only successful sequence of plays at the table. |

nt|Muller was now endplayed and Jassem, who was obviously playing in great form, actually claimed his contract at this point! For the sake of us lesser mortals in the audience we will go into some more detail as to why Jassem's claim was genuine. |mc|10|

ls|es|up|40|nt|At 7 of the 8 tables in the Cap Gemini 4@S was declared by South. At the 8th table, the winners of the event, Zia Mahmood and Andrew Robson, played in 4@H which was much easier to make on the actual lie of the East-West cards. |

pg| ***** 42 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|hs|es|nt|All 7 declarers in 4@S continued by taking a spade finesse and all 7 Easts ducked their @SK. |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|ls|es|pc|sq|pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s4|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


at|The only declarer besides Krzysztof Jassem to make 4@S was Italy's ^*BAntonio Sementa^*N, who is, in our opinion, one of the strongest players in the world today. It is unclear from the record on ^*BBridgePlaza^*N whether Sementa duplicated Jassem's line or whether the defense slipped at some point. |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|In fairness to the other declarer's at the Cap Gemini, very few had as much information as Jassem did as most Souths opened 1@S and most Wests overcalled 2@C. That doesn't take anything away from Jassem's fine effort on this deal, of course.|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


up|1|hs|es|nt|One last interesting point about this deal: if East had won the @SK on the first round of trump |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |

hs|es|hs|ed|at|and returned either a trump or a diamond, declarer would be left without recourse (we won't go into the details here, but you can trust us on this).|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


ls|es|ls|ed|nt|We found it quite remarkable that all 7 Easts who faced this test in the toughest pairs event of them all were unable to come up with the right solution! We have to admit that ducking the @SK looks like a very natural play. Sometimes this game is just too tough for even the best bridge players in the world.|
