bt||nt||cs|1|at|
^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 251 - July 2, 2001 ^*N }
^-
This week's deal was analyzed and sent to us by long time ^*BDeal of the Week^*N reader ^*BSriram Narasimhan^*N. As you will see, Sriram has a talent for spotting interesting bridge deals. The end position that was reached when Sriram was kibitzing this deal is unlike anything we have seen before. The declarer misplayed the ending at the table, but Sriram later figured out that the contract should have been made. 

If you would like to see one of your favorite deals appear as a future ^*BDeal of the Week^*N, e-mail all of the relevant details to:

|cs|2|at|^-{ ^*Bfred@@bridgebase.com^*N }

^-World headquarters of ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N will be closed until July 5 as President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N and Vice President ^*BSheri Winestock^*N (our entire staff) will be playing in a tournament in Biarritz, France. Fred and Sheri will be playing together in the Open Pairs and Fred will be partnering the great ^*BZia Mahmood^*N for the first time in the Swiss Teams. There are sure to be some interesting deals in Biarritz that will be featured in future ^*BDeals of the Week^*N.

This week's deal has been posted 5 days earlier than scheduled. Next week's deal (number 252) will be posted on the expected date, Monday, July 9.

hs|nd|nt|North-South were playing the ^*BPrecision^*N bidding system where it is perfectly acceptable to open the bidding 1@D with a balanced 11-count. This style can be dangerous in a natural bidding system where opening bids of 1 of a suit already have a very wide range. This is not a problem in Precision where all hands with 16 or more HCP are opened with a strong 1@C.

ls|sh|hs|wd|mb|P|mb|P|mb|2D|at|This was passed around to West who balanced with 2@D (safer than you might think - in Precision North's sequence does not promise more than 2 cards in diamonds). This turned out to be a good decision as both 1NT and 2@D probably would have made.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


hs|wc|ls|wd|hs|sc|nt|This was passed around to South, who in turn made the good decision to compete to 3@C, ending the auction. West certainly expected to beat 3@C, but we agree with his decision not to double. The auction had gone well from West's point of view. He already had positive equity on the deal and it would be greedy to risk that by doubling.|
