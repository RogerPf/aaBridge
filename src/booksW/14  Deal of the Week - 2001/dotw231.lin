3d|5|rh||ah|Deal of the|ah|Week #231|
bt||nt||cs|4|at|
^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 231 - February 12, 2001 ^*N }
^-
|cs|1|at|^-{ ^*BSPECIAL!!! There are 2 Deals of the Week this week!^*N }
^-
Both of these deals are declarer play problems that are somewhat less difficult than most of the material that we present in ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N (that's why you get 2 of them).

The first deal was shown to us by our friend ^*BRoy Hughes^*N. Roy is been the Captain of our team in the IMP league at ^*BKate Buckman's Bridge Club^*N in Toronto. Not only has Roy done an excellent job organizing the team and producing great results with his partner, ^*BJim Green^*N, we have also enjoyed the customary (in Canada at least) after-the-match beer and discussion of the boards with Roy. Although Roy is not well known outside of Canada, he is a gifted player with great insights into the game. Roy and Jim are working hard on their partnership and we expect they will soon be representing Canada in international events.

The second deal is based on a hand that ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N misplayed at the table. The second deal will be presented after the solution to the first deal is explained.

Reminder: You can now receive ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N by e-mail. In order to do so download ^*BBridgeVu^*N, our free bridge movie viewer through:

hs|sh|nt|You are the declarer in 4@H after East has opened the bidding with a weak 2@D. |
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


ls|Sh|pc|DQ|at|West's opening lead is the @DQ. You can assume that trumps are 2-1 (otherwise the contract is probably doomed). Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sc|nt|Assuming there is no trump loser, the only danger to the contract is that 3 club tricks could be lost. Unless you guess very badly, you can always hold your club losers to 2 by playing on that suit yourself, but there is no need to guess on this deal. Proper technique will guarantee the contract regardless of the distribution of the missing club honors.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|nd|nt|It may seem natural to duck the first trick, but this would be a mistake. For one thing, West may switch to a low club from @CAxxxx or @CQxxxx and the contract would be down if you misguessed the club position. Even if West were to continue diamonds you would be left with no way to avoid having to guess the clubs. |

sk||hs|ed|hs|es|hs|sh|at|The defense cannot afford to break clubs (or you would lose 2 clubs tricks at most) so they will continue either diamonds or spades for you to ruff. That suit will then be eliminated from the North-South hands.|

hs|nc|hs|sc|hs|ec|at|You are now in a position to guarantee only 2 club losers regardless of the layout of the honors in that suit. You can lead any club from your hand and pass the trick to East (unless West covers in which case playing the @CK from dummy will make things easy). |

ls|ec|ls|nc|hs|ed|hs|sc|hs|nh|at|and a diamond return will concede a ruff and discard. In either case only 2 club tricks will be lost and the contract will be made.|mc|10|

nt|Note that the danger of ducking the first trick is more serious than the risk of the defense scoring 2 club tricks and a ruff at once. |

hs|nh|hs|sh|at|The only way you can get back to the dummy to eliminate diamonds is in trump, but you would exhaust your trump supply in the process. |

at|West's opening lead of the @DQ is overtaken by East with the @DK. Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on.|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


sk||hs|ws|hs|wd|nt|The distribution you should try to guard against is the one shown above - where one of the defenders was dealt 3 spades and 4 diamonds. If either spades or diamonds divide evenly the contract will be easy and if spades are 4-0 the contract is likely to fail. |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


ls|ws|ls|wd|hs|sd|hs|ns|at|You should aim to ruff your 4th diamond in the dummy eventually, but it is important to time the play carefully. |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |

hs|ns|hs|ss|at|If you draw 2 rounds of trump, West will be able to draw a third round when he gains the lead in diamonds. If you play a third round of diamonds before drawing any trump, the defense will will get a trump promotion as before. |

hs|es|hs|ed|hs|ws|nt|The only danger of the recommended line is that East might have been dealt 5 diamonds and 3 spades. On the above layout a diamond return by East at trick 2 will leave South with no chance. |
