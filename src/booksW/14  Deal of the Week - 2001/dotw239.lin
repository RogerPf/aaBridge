^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 239 - April 9, 2001 ^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played by ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N in a recent matchpoint game at ^*BDoubles Duplicate Bridge Club^*N in Toronto.

^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N is pleased to announce the release of our latest educational software product:

|cs|1|at|^-{ ^*BPlay Bridge With Larry Cohen^*N 
 ^*B1999 Life Master Pairs - Day 3^*N }
^-
This product, the third in the ^*BPlay Bridge with Larry Cohen^*N series, presents all 52 deals from the final day of what is arguably the strongest matchpoint event on the bridge calender. In each deal, Larry has the reader sit in the seat that faced the most interesting problems when that deal was played. He evaulates all aspects of each deal in an "over-my-shoulder" manner and presents the reader with quizzes (what bid would you make? what card would you play?) at the critical points of each deal. After each deal, the reader is able to compare the result he would have achieved against the actual matchpoint scores from the 1999 Life Master Pairs final.

Larry Cohen has been one of the most successful matchpoint players in bridge during the past 15 years or so. His insights into what it takes to win at pairs will be invaluable to tournament players of all levels of ability. Larry expresses himself very well in writing and this has helped to make him one of the most popular bridge authors in the world today.

sk|w|nt|Fred was the declarer in 3NT after East had opened 1@D in third position. Put yourself in the West seat for a moment and think about what card you would select as your opening lead.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||lb|*cWhat card would you lead?^^dq^s8754hj8752c86dq3^dq|hc|dq|nt|There is really no ^*Icorrect^*N solution to this problem, but we would lead the @DQ. In general we strongly believe in the concept of leading partner's suit. The fact that partner opened the bidding with 1@D in third position should give you an additional reason to lead his suit. Do you know why?|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|The reason is that, if partner has a marginal opening bid (entirely possible given the bidding and your hand), he may have decided to open for the purpose of directing the lead. You should not disappoint him. The strange lead of the @D3 could turn out to be the winner and we have some sympathy for that choice.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


lc|dq|hs|wh|nt|The actual West chose to lead a 4th best @H5. We have very little sympathy for that choice. If you chose to lead a heart and want some sympathy, it might make you feel better to know that many players would prefer to lead a heart as well.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


ls|wh|pc|H5|sk||hs|wd|hs|ed|hs|ec|hs|nc|hs|sc|nt|As you can see by looking at all 4 hands, the lead of the @DQ would have defeated 3NT - declarer cannot come to enough tricks without the clubs, but then East would take his @CA on the first round of the suit and cash 4 diamond tricks to defeat the contract. Not that this proves anything about the ^*Icorrect^*N opening lead from West's hand...|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


ls|ec|ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|nd|nt|At first glance it appears that the @D3 would be an equally effective lead. On that lead, if declarer plays the @D2 from dummy, East could insert a middle diamond and 3NT would fail.  Note, however, that if declarer plays the @DJ from dummy there would be no way for the defense to unravel the diamond suit.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


ls|wd|ls|nd|ls|ed|hs|ns|nt|Before we get into how the play actually went on this deal, what do you think of the concept of opening the North hand with a weak 2@S? |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt|Again there is no right or wrong here. The issue of whether the North hand should be opened 2@S or not is mostly a matter of partnership style. We have no problem with 2@S, especially at matchpoints. If North-South were vulnerable, if North did not have the @S109, or if North had 5332 distribution we would not open 2@S in second position, even at matchpoints. |

pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|3NT was not in any danger, but, since Fred was playing matchpoints, it was important for him to try to score as many overtricks as possible. Winning 11 tricks would be especially rewarding as it appeared that any pairs who played in spades would have a good chance to hold their losses to  just the @DA and the @CA.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |

ls|eh|
pc|H4|hs|sh|at|and Fred was at the crossroads. Do you think he took the heart finesse? |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||lb|*mDid Fred finesse in hearts?^Yes~No^2|ls|sh|pc|hq|hs|wh|nt|Fred chose to play the @HQ. He strongly suspected that West had been dealt 5 hearts headed by the @HJ. Fred thought that if he took the heart finesse, West would win the @HJ and return a diamond to East's @DA, holding Fred to 10 tricks. Meanwhile, Fred saw that he had a good chance to win 11 tricks by rising with the @HQ. |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


hs|wh|nt|West followed with the @H2, confirming that he had been dealt 5 hearts. |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


ls|wh|pc|H2|pc|H6|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


at|It is true that East could have prevented Fred from winning 11 tricks in a number of ways (by ducking the first round of clubs, by returning a club, or by returning a low diamond). It is hard to blame East for his actual defense - he (wrongly) trusted his partner to have a good reason not to lead a diamond.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|Given the way the play had gone so far, there was nothing the defense could do to prevent Fred from winning 11 tricks from this point. There were only 10 obvious tricks (5 spades, 2 hearts, the @DK, and 2 clubs). Can you see where Fred's 11th trick came from?|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |

pg| ***** 48 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|wd|up|43|
hs|nd|hs|sd|nt|We find it strange that North-South inevitably wind up taking 2 diamond tricks on this deal after the play to the first few tricks. The variation where East discards the @DA is particularly strange - North-South do not have to lose any diamond tricks in the process of winning 2 tricks in that suit!|
