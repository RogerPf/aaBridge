^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 232 - February 19, 2001 ^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played by ^*BBarry Rigal^*N, originally from London and now living in New York City. Barry was playing with ^*BGertrude Plosky^*N at ^*BHonors Duplicate Bridge Club^*N in New York when this week's deal was played.

Barry is one of the best and most prolific bridge authors in the world today. His articles frequently appear in several major bridge magazines and he has authored or co-authored many excellent bridge books. Barry is also one of the best vugraph commentators there is. If you have ever sat in the vugraph theatre at a North American or World Championship, chances are pretty good that Barry was one of the people at the microphone. Barry's quick and accurate analysis, his familiarity with a wide variety of bidding methods, and his witty comments all contribute toward making vugraph more enjoyable and educational for those in the audience.

Barry is also a very strong player. His work frequently prevents him from playing in major events, but when he gets a chance to play in such events, he is often in contention. Barry won his first North American Championship last summer when he was part of the team that won the ^*BMasters Mixed Teams^*N at the ACBL Summer NABC in Anaheim, California.

Barry's next work assignment is at the ^*BForbo-Krommenie Teams^*N in The Netherlands next week. ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N was invited to play on the North American team in the prestigious ^*BNations Cup^*N event at the ^*BForbo^*N. Complete coverage of this tournament, including ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N, will be available through:

4-3 fits (also known as Moysian fits after ^*BSonny Moyse^*N, a former Editor of ^*BThe Bridge World^*N magazine) provide some of the most interesting and challenging declarer play problems. In this week's deal Barry found himself in a 4-3 fit and proceeded to make his contract, despite the fact that trumps broke 5-1. Barry did receive a little help from the defense, but the sequence of plays required to defeat the contract was not easy to find. See if you can spot how the defense could have prevailed as you read through this week's deal.

hs|wd|hs|nh|hs|sh|nt|Barry was the declarer in 4@H after West had opened the bidding with 1@D and Gertrude had made an aggressive takout double. Barry expected 4@H to be a reasonable contract so he bid what he thought he could make in an attempt to conceal the nature of his hand from the opponents. |

ls|wd|ls|nh|ls|sh|nt|A more scientific sequence might have ended in 3NT (which, as it turns out, would have been a much easier contract than 4@H). Fortunately for us,  Barry and Gertrude avoided 3NT and played in 4@H so that we did not have to find another deal for this week's ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N.|
