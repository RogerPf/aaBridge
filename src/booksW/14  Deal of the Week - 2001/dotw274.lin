^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 274 - December 10, 2001^*N }
^-
|cs|2|at|^-{ ^*BSpecial!!! There are 2 Deals of the Week this Week!^*N }
^-
Both of this week's deals feature hot defenses that were found during recent major tournaments. 

This week's first deal took place near the end of the Bermuda Bowl semi-final match between Norway and Poland in Paris. Two of the world's top pairs are featured, ^*BAlfredo Versace^*N-^*BLorenzo Lauria^*N of Italy and ^*BGlenn-Grotheim^*N-^*BTerje Å^*N of Norway. Norway went on to win this match, but lost in the final to team USA II. This deal has been rotated to make South the declarer.

This week's bonus second deal was the final deal of the Reisinger Board-A-Match Teams at the recent ACBL North American Championships in Las Vegas. This deal features ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N and his partner ^*BBrad Moss^*N on defense. We could not find a copy of the hand records from this session so the deal you see here may not be exactly the same as the one that was played. Fred and Brad were part of the team that won the Reisinger and they would not have won this event without their fine result on this board. The second deal will appear at the end of the presentation of the first deal.

pg| ***** 6 ***** |


pc|D2|pc|DJ|at|and Lauria played the @DJ to the first trick. Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on. Keep in mind that Italy was losing the match and running out of boards. It is entirely possible one or both of the defenders has made an unusual bid in the hope of generating a swing.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|Å gave the matter considerable thought before playing a card to trick one. He realized that there was no way to come to 9 tricks without playing on spades. The problem was that he would have to give up the lead to the @SA and the defenders would then be able to cash out the diamond suit. Å needed a specific layout of the defenders cards to make 3NT. Do you know what it was?|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|sk||hc|sa|hs|wd|hs|ed|nt|In fact, the layout that Å required was very close to the layout that actually existed. He knew that Versace had been dealt 3 diamonds while Lauria started with 5 cards in that suit and that 3NT could be made only if Versace held both the @DA and the @SA. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ls|ed|ls|wd|lc|sa|hs|sd|nt|He therefore allowed Lauria's @DJ to win the first trick |

ls|eh|ls|wh|lc|sa|up|7|
hs|nc|hs|ns|nt|Å realized, of course, that discarding a heart from dummy would leave him with no hope. His only alternative was to discard one of dummy's black suit winners. He actually chose to discard a spade (a club discard would lead to the same result). |

pg| ***** 30 ***** |


up|23|hs|ed|nt|Watching this great battle unfold on vugraph was very exciting and we expect that this deal will be remembered for many years by those of us who were lucky enough to be in the audience! Give Lorenzo Lauria a lot of credit on this one for his enterprising 2@D overcall - a call that would not have occurred to us, but was instrumental in generating a much-needed swing.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


ls|ed|pn|South,Fred,North,Brad,South,West,North,East|md|3S865HKJ8742DQ9C94,SA42HT5D87643CT82,SJ93HA9DAKJ2CAJ73,SKQT7HQ63DT5CKQ65|sv|b|mb|1D|mb|1S|
hs|es|nt|Here is this week's second deal. North opened 1@D and ^*BBrad Moss^*N chose to overcall 1@S as East. Fred and Brad do not overcall 4-card suits very often, but Brad's decision was influenced by his strong spades, the board-a-match scoring, and because he correctly judged that his team needed a good result. |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


ls|es|mb|P|mb|2S|hs|ws|nt|South chose to pass (we would have made a negative double) and Fred raised aggressively to 2@S. |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


ls|ws|mb|P|mb|P|at|North, with a good hand, but no good bid had to pass and Brad passed as well. |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


hs|sh|hs|nh|at|South balanced with 3@H which North raised to game. 4@H was the final contract. |mb|3H|mb|P|mb|4H|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|hs|ws|nt|Fred chose to lead a low spade. While the underlead of an Ace against a suit contract is generally frowned upon in bridge literature, Fred and Brad are not adverse to making such leads from time to time. This seemed like the right time to Fred. On this particular deal, the net effect of this lead was to make the rest of the defense more difficult (versus the lead of the @SA)!|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt||ls|ws|pc|S2|hs|es|at|Brad played the @S10 to the first trick (giving Fred a split second of terror) which won the trick (phew!). |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


ls|es|pc|S3|pc|ST|pc|S5|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


hs|es|at|Brad now made the very thoughtful return of the @SQ |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


ls|es|pc|SQ|pc|S6|hs|ws|at|and Fred had to figure out what to make of that. What message do you think that Brad was trying to get across?|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|Fred knew that Brad knew that Fred had been dealt the @SA (Fred would have led a high spot if he lacked an honor in the suit). If Brad (who clearly new more about the deal than Fred) had wanted to retain the lead he would have led the @SK to the second trick. If Brad wanted Fred to win the @SA and switch (to a club presumably) he would have led a low spade to Fred's @SA at trick 2.|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|There was only one other thing that Brad could possibly want Fred to do - overtake the @SQ with his @SA |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


ls|ws|pc|SA|pc|S9|

hs|ws|at|and return the suit. |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |

ls|wc|ls|sh|pc|HK|pc|c2|at|the declarer claimed down 1 (dummy's diamond suit would provide a discard for declarer's club loser). |mc|9|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


up|21|nt|While it is true that the declarer might have gone down in 4@H anyway on a less spectacular defense, we suspect that he probably would have made his contract. In any case, it was nice for Fred and Brad not to have to find out as their defense left declarer with absolutely no chance to win 10 tricks.|
