bt||nt||cs|3|at|
^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 265 - October 8, 2001^*N }
^-
^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N and Vice President ^*BSheri Winestock^*N spent most of last week in San Jose, California helping team USA II prepare for the upcoming ^*BBermuda Bowl^*N World Championships in Paris, France. Team USA II consists of ^*BRose Meltzer-Kyle Larsen^*N, ^*BAlan Sontag-Peter Weichsel^*N, and ^*BChip Martel-Lew Stansby^*N.

All of these individuals and partnerships have enjoyed considerable success both at the ACBL Nationals and in international competition. Despite the great experience of this team, some of their opponents in Paris will be playing systems and conventions that the members of team USA II have rarely (or never) had to face before. The primary purpose of last week's training was to practice playing against these conventions.

One of the main techniques we employed was to use a computer to generate random deals in which these unusual conventions would arise. Each partnership on team USA II would then bid their hands while Fred, Sheri, and ^*BJan Martel^*N supplied the bids for their opponents. Jan and Chip had worked very hard to prepare defenses to these conventions and this was an excellent opportunity to test the effectiveness (and ease of memorization) of these countermeasures.

After each set of deals was bid, we used a computer equipped with a projector to display the deals and the auctions for each pair. The entire team (along with Fred, Sheri, and Jan) then discussed these deals. The discussion focused mostly on defensive bidding, but some deals (such as this week's ^*BDeal of the Week^*N) turned out to be fascinating from a card play point of view.

nt|It was a wonderful experience for Fred and Sheri to be able to spend a few days talking and studying bridge with all of these great players. Here are some of the insights we gained into the members of team USA II and why they have been so successful over the years:

Chip Martel is perhaps the leading theorist of this group. He has a remarkable mind (not only for bridge) and we believe that there are only a handful of players in the world that have the ability to think about the game on the level that Chip does. Lew Stansby, Chip's longtime partner, is known for having great judgment and the perfect temperment for high-level bridge. Their partnership is extremely strong and we do not recall these 2 having a single bidding misunderstanding during the time we spent with them.

Alan Sontag and Peter Weichsel are another partnership with a lot of history. Peter is very strong when it comes to theory. He is extremely careful and tough at the table. Alan is a true natural when it comes to bridge. Alan is somehow able to play bridge very quickly and very well at the same time! This partnership have made significant contributions to the development of the Precision bidding system over the years and their current system is the result of many years of hard work.

Rose Meltzer is one of the few female bridge players in the world who has achieved great success in open events. Rose will be the first woman to represent the United States in the Bermuda Bowl in many years and she has really earned this distinction. Rose's partnership with Kyle Larsen is relatively new, but these two played a starring role in their team's victory in last year's Spingold. Kyle is another example of a natural bridge player. Besides his ability, Kyle brings a great attitude to the bridge table and this helps Kyle to bring out the best in his partners.

All of the members of team USA II are very nice people and we wish them all the best in Paris!

nt|Imagine that you hold the South cards. East opens the bidding with a multi 2@D, showing a weak 2-bid in either hearts or spades. Although multi is a very popular convention throughout much of the world, you don't see it very much in North American tournaments (which is why team USA II wanted some practice defending against it).

mb|2N|an|16-18|

nt|On this particular hand, the multi 2@D opening does not present much of a problem for the defense that team USA II is using. South has a perfect 2NT overcall which, according to these methods, suggests a balanced hand with 16-18 HCP. |

mb|P|mb|3H|an|Transfer|mb|P|mb|3S|
nt|Each partnership on team USA II had agreed that in this situation, they would use the same methods they would normally use after a 2NT opening bid. North's 3@H was thus a Jacoby Transfer and South completed the transfer with 3@S. |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |

at|North's 3NT offered South a choice between 3NT and 4@S. What choice do you think team USA II preferred? |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


lb|*MWhat call did USA II prefer?^Pass~4 Spades^1|

nt|Team USA II unanimously thought that, despite holding 3-card spade support, passing 3NT was the percentage action with the South hand (we agree). South's flat distribution, the danger of a defensive heart ruff, and the possibility of a bad spade break all point toward 3NT. Still, this is a close decision as South's weak heart spots (and weak clubs) could represent a threat to 3NT.|

hs|ss|nt|It turns out, however, that 4@S presents a much more interesting card play problem than 3NT would. Suppose therefore that you bid 4@S which becomes the final contract. |

ls|ss|pc|H9|
at|West's opening lead is the @H9. Yes, we know you would rather be in 3NT, but think about how you would play in 4@S before reading on. You can assume that East was dealt a 6-card heart suit. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |

ls|ns|ls|ss|hs|nd|hs|sd|hs|nc|hs|sc|at|you will have to hold your minor suit losers to 1 in order to make the contract. That doesn't rate to be easy. In fact, you are in big trouble!|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|nh|nt|First things first, play a low heart from the dummy. If you play the @HQ, |

sk||hs|wd|hs|ed|hs|wc|hs|ec|nt|Here is one interesting layout of the East-West hands that is similar to the one that the players and coaches of team USA II discussed. It took this group a few minutes to figure out what could happen on this layout. As you will see, it would not be practical to try to analyze all relevant layouts of the East-West cards.|

ls|ec|ls|wc|ls|nc|ls|sc|up|28|

hs|ec|hc|dqck|nt|4@S can be made in a similar fashion if West exits with either the @DQ or the @CK instead of a low diamond. In both of these variations East will be caught in a similar strip squeeze that will force him to lead away from the @CJ in the end game. |
