nt|Wow do you have a good hand! We sometimes present quizzes in ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N, but given that most of the readers of this feature are advanced players, we have never felt the need to present the following kind of quiz in the past...|

nt|This hand has 30 HCP. That's the most that we have ever seen! We cannot offer you any words of wisdom with respect to how this hand ^*Ishould^*N be bid, but this week's deal is really about the play. Suppose you open 2@C and rebid 4NT over partner's 2@D response. Partner makes the first 5-level Jacoby transfer in history and raises your 5@S to 6@S.|

nt|West leads the @CJ and partner puts down a very suitable dummy. You are in a fine contract and you can think about how you would play this hand as declarer if you want, but... |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


sk||hs|ws|at|on the actual deal trumps were 5-0 and we suspect that the line of play you thought of didn't cater to this (in fact, if it did then you misplayed the hand). |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


ls|ws|nt|Instead of thinking about how you would play this hand as declarer, try thinking about whether or not it is possible to make 6@S on this layout against best defense. When you go on to the next page you will be able to experiment with how the play of this deal could go.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


pf|y|nt|You can now experiment with how the play of this deal could go by clicking on the cards you want to play for all 4 plays. When you are done click the  ^$40  button on the toolbar below to read the answer. The  ^$6  button on the toolbar can be used at any point to take back the last card that you played.|

up|40|ls|ws|ls|ns|hs|ss|nt|Now let's back up to trick 2 and see how South can emerge with 12 tricks. There is some room for flexibility with the first few tricks, but the critical move is to start the trump suit by leading the @S8 (and not the @SA) on the first round of the suit. The @S8 lead is a very nice play with all 4 hands in view, but it would be a very poor play on a single dummy basis.|

hs|ss|at|Again, there are a variety of ways that 12 tricks can be made from this point, but the key is to refrain from playing the @SA from your hand until the endgame. |
