bt||nt||cs|4|at|
^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 270 - November 12, 2001^*N }
^-
One of the first bridge players that ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N ran into after arriving at the recent World Championships in Paris, was his Brazilian friend ^*BMarcelo Branco^*N. Marcelo, who has been one of the world's best players for over 20 years, loves a good bridge problem and he quickly handed Fred a scrap of paper that contained a declarer play problem that Marcelo had solved at the table. 

Fred knew from past experience that when Marcelo Branco gives you a bridge problem it is certain to be a good one. Fred was not disappointed. This week's deal is based on that problem. See how you do...

hs|sh|sk|s|nt|East dealt and opened 1@S and you, South, overcalled 2@H. You may not like 2@H or some of the other calls that were made, but this is how the bidding happened at the table and it is relevant to the play problem. |

hs|nc|nt|West's opening lead was the @C8. Marcelo began, "I played low from dummy |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


ls|nc|pc|C5|pc|CA|pc|CJ|at|and East won the @CA as I falsecarded with the @CJ, of course." It took a moment to sink in, but Fred realized that the @CJ was the only club that Marcelo could have played in order to keep the position in that suit unclear to East. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


pc|D5|
at|"East put the @D5 on the table immediately," said Marcelo. "How would you play from here?"|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|West's double of 3@D along with East's immediate switch to the lowest outstanding spot card in that suit strongly suggested that the diamonds were 6-1. The fact that West chose to lead a club (instead of a spade) made it likely that the clubs were 5-1 as well. East's opening bid with at most 10 HCP (assuming the @DK is with West) further suggested that East had good distribution.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


sk||hs|ec|hs|wd|nt|For a player of Marcelo's calibre, it was not difficult to figure out the entire distribution of the deal. West had been dealt 3361 and East's pattern was 5215. We don't think there is any other layout that is consistent with the bidding and the early play. Even with all of the cards in view, however, it is not easy to see how you can win 10 tricks against best defense. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt|You now have a chance to experiment with how the play could go from this point by clicking on the cards you want to play for all 4 players. Click the  ^$40  button on the toolbar below when you want to read the answer. The  ^$6  button on the toolbar can be used at any point to take back the last card that you played. |ls|wd|ls|ec|pf|y|

nt|Marcelo cleared the first hurdle by winning the @DA (had he played low on this trick the defenders would have won the @DK and the next 2 tricks with ruffs to defeat the contract). |

hs|eh|hs|nh|hs|sd|at|but he would then be left in a hopeless position. He would still have a diamond loser in his hand and, with East able to overruff the dummy and no squeeze possibilities, the contract would be doomed. |

hs|es|hs|sh|hs|wh|nt|Marcelo therefore decided that it would be best to draw trump immediately. West followed 3 times, as expected, and East discarded a spade on the third round of trump. |

ls|nc|ls|ns|hs|es|hs|ec|at|East was caught in a most unusual squeeze on this trick and his choice of discards would determine how the rest of the play would go. |

hs|wd|at|West would then have to find a very counterintuitive diamond return. Not even the great Marcelo Branco could have found a way to win 10 tricks after that defense!|
