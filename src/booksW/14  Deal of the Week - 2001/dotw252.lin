^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 252 - July 9, 2001 ^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played last week by ^*BZia Mahmood^*N at the International Festival of Bridge in Biarritz, France. ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N was playing with the legendary Zia when this week's deal was played. This deal took place in the team event in Biarritz. Fred and Zia, along with Americans ^*BGeoff Hampson^*N and ^*BReese Milner^*N, led the field for most of the event, but faltered down the stretch to finish 4th. 

It was a great experience for Fred to play with Zia. Fred expected the bridge itself to be exciting and he was not disappointed. What impressed him most about Zia, however, was how good he made everybody (opponents, kibitzers, and his partner of course) feel about bridge. Zia is not only one of the very best bridge players in the world today, but he is also blessed with great charisma, warmth, and humor. Zia naturally makes people enjoy bridge. A character like Zia has the potential to do for bridge what ^*BMichael Jordan^*N did for basketball and what ^*BTiger Woods^*N is doing for golf.
 
Zia Mahmood is a real credit to our game and it was a privilege and an honor (not to mention a great deal of fun and a tremendous learning opportunity) for Fred to have a chance to play with Zia in Biarritz.

The Biarritz Festival is an anual event that we highly recommend. Biarritz itself in a beautiful place. The tournament itself is very challenging as many foreign stars and top French experts always attend. At the same time the atmosphere is very sociable and the playing schedule is quite relaxed, leaving plenty of time for everyone to enjoy Biarritz.

nt|After East dealt and opened 1@C, Zia overcalled 1@D as South. The theorists out there might scoff at the 1@D overcall on a marginal hand with a marginal suit, but Zia cares more about practice than theory. In his experience bidding (as opposed to passing) on marginal hands has been a winning strategy over the years. |

ls|Wd|ls|nd|at|In this amazing end position Zia can overruff East and win the last 3 tricks (with the help of a finesse against West's @DJ if East chooses to ruff the @SJ with the @DQ).|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt|Every serious student of the game is familiar with the ^*BDevil's Coup^*N end position, but for almost all experts this position is little more than a curiosity. This ending is so rare that a great player could play a lifetime of bridge without ever seeing it arise at the table. |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt|For most bridge players, the successful execution of a ^*BDevil's Coup^*N would be a very serious thing and represent a great moment in their bridge careers. Zia, of course, was able to make light of the situation. In fact, about 4 tricks prior to this position he asked Fred, "Have you ever seen a ^*BDevil's Coup^*N before?"|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|The question was directed at Fred, but the opponents (and kibitzers) heard it too, of course. This kind of talk in the middle of a hand is very rare in serious international bridge tournaments. It is a good example of how refreshing and fun it can be to have Zia at the table!|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|When Fred answered that he had never seen a ^*BDevil's Coup^*N before (except in books) Zia told him that he was about to see his first one! When Fred later asked Zia if he had ever seen this position occur at the table before, Zia responded that he had seen another declarer achieve this coup, but that he had never previously done so himself. |

nt|Much to Zia's credit, he found it very amusing that West had found the ^*BDevil's Coup Denial^*N play of ruffing with the @DJ. The average bridge player would be disappointed after being denied the chance to make a once-in-a-lifetime play, but Zia's attitude toward the game is not that of an average bridge player. We are all fortunate that Zia Mahmood loves the game so much!|
