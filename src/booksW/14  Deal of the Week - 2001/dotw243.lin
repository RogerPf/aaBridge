hs|ss|nt|South dealt and opened with a weak 2@S and all passed. We don't mind the concept of opening the occasional weak 2 with a 5-card suit, but we wouldn't do it on this hand (the spades are too weak) despite the position and vulnerability (only East-West are vulnerable - in the graphic in the upper left corner above red means vulnerable and white means not vulnerable).|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


ls|ss|hs|ed|hs|wd|nt|Sheri started with a high diamond, of course. This was not the best lead double dummy, but in our view, it is the only reasonable lead from her hand. Fred followed with his singleton @DJ, but Sheri could not read this as a singleton. Fred and Sheri play upside down count and attitude signals and Fred would play the @DJ from a holding like @DJ53.|

hs|eh|hs|wh|hs|nh|nt|Sheri found the best defense of a heart shift. Her lead of the @H7 (3rd and 5th best) was ducked in the dummy and Fred won his @HK. |

nt|It was certainly cute that Fred and Sheri were able to get a ruff in a suit in which they each started with 4 cards, but 3 mistakes were made along the way. The declarer made 2 mistakes and Fred made 1 mistake. Can you see what those mistakes were?|mc|7|

hs|eh|hs|nh|nt|Strangely enough, even though it was vital for declarer to get the @HA out of the way himself, Fred's mistake was that he should have also taken out dummy's @HA (instead of his actual club return) after he won the @HK! |

hs|nd|hs|nc|nt|The declarer would  be left in a familiar position. Regardless of whether he led a diamond or a club to get off dummy, the defense would prevail. Do you find it paradoxical that both the declarer and the defense must strive to get the @HA out of the dummy on this deal?|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|nd|up|16|hs|eh|hs|nh|nt|So far we have seen that Fred made a mistake by returning a club instead of a heart after he won the @HK. Fred's error gave the declarer a chance to make his contract, but he gave it right back by not cashing the @HA himself. Declarer actually made an earlier error that would have left the defense with no chance at all. Can you see it?|
