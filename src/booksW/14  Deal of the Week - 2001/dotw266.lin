nt|Fred was fortunate enough to hold the South hand when this week's deal was played. Fred was the dealer and both sides were vulnerable. Fred was playing IMPs and both of his opponents were excellent players. What call do you think Fred made?|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


lb|*bWhat call did Fred make?^^1s|
hs|ss|mb|1S|
nt|Fred chose to open 1@S. Fred certainly had the playing strength for a 2@C opening, but he did not have sufficient high card and defensive values to make him comfortable with 2@C. This is really a matter of partnership style.There is nothing wrong with opening 2@C on hands like this if that's what your partnership wants to do, but for Fred and Sheri this hand is a 1@S opening.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|The most important thing to understand about this hand is that it is unlikely that you will ever be able to describe it accurately to your partner, regardless of what you open. Furthermore, partner could have some very bad hands in which slam is layown and some very good hands where slam is very poor or has no chance at all. |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|Do not expect a scientific auction when you pick up a hand like Fred's as you are most unlikely to see one take place. It is very likely that you are going to have to decide on your own at some point just how many spades you should bid. Opening 1@S rates to maximize the amount of information you will receive, which will increase the chances that your enventual guess will be correct.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


ls|ss|mb|P|mb|1N|an|Semi-forcing|
nt|West passed and Sheri responded with a semi-forcing 1NT. Sheri and Fred played that a 2/1 response forces the partnership to game - their 1NT response to a major suit opening could thus contain up to a balanced 12 HCP. The opener would normally bid over the 1NT response, but will sometimes pass with minimum values and 5332 distribution.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


mb|2H|mb|?|
nt|If East had passed over 1NT, Fred was planning on rebidding 3@D (a game force). East overcalled 2@H, however, giving Fred an entirely different problem. Fred felt somewhat lucky that the opponents had remained relatively peaceful up until this point, but he got the feeling that this was about to change. What call do you think he made now?|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^3H|mb|3H|hs|sh|
nt|Fred chose to cuebid 3@H, suggesting a very strong hand with long spades. The fact that Fred had been dealt a singleton @HA did not come into play in Fred's partnership with Sheri - 3@H said nothing about hearts - it just showed a great hand for spades. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ls|sh|hs|sd|nt|Fred considered various tactical choices (such as 3@D) instead of 3@H, but he decided it would be a good idea to let Sheri in on his secret (that he had a great hand). 3@H had the further advantage of creating a forcing situation in case the opponents decided to bid some more. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


hs|sc|hs|sh|hs|sd|at|A 4@H ^*Bautosplinter^*N (a splinter in support of yourself) was another consideration, but Fred did not like any of his side suit holdings for this call.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


ls|sh|ls|sc|hs|ss|nt|Fred and Sheri do play that 4@D would be natural and forcing here, but the disparity between Fred's 2 suits was far too great for him to seriously consider this call. In the style that they play, a 4@D jump shift here would always be based on 2 strong 5+ card suits. Fred and Sheri use double as takeout here, suggesting a good hand with no good bid.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


ls|ss|ls|sd|mb|P|mb|3S|
nt|West passed and Sheri bid 3@S. The 3@S call doesn't mean much here, but it did deny a heart stopper as Fred's 3@H would sometimes be based on a hand with interest in 3NT. Sheri's 3@S also denied a source of tricks in one of the minors - she would bid her long suit at the 4-level with that. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


mb|4C|mb|?|at|East came back into the auction with 4@C and Fred had yet another decision to make...|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^4h|
mb|4h|hs|sh|nt|Fred chose to bid 4@H to show both genuine slam interest along with a heart control. |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


ls|sh|hs|sd|at|Perhaps 4@D (which should probably suggest some length in that suit) would have been a better choice, but Fred knew that Sheri did not need him to tell her that diamond values would be helpful. |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt|Furthermore, Fred thought that Sheri might read 5@D as a (length-showing) attempt to help her out with a 5-level decision (rather than as a hand with genuine interest in slam). |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


ls|sd|hs|sh|at|He liked 4@H because it delivered a very clear and simple message: "Despite the fact that you have shown me nothing, I think we might have slam!"|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


mb|5C|mb|D|mb|P|mb|?|
ls|sh|nt|West now came to life with 5@C and Sheri doubled, a strong suggestion to defend. Sheri would have made a forcing pass if she thought it might be right for Fred to go on to the 5-level (or higher). Perhaps the time had come for Fred to make the "informed final decision" that he had spent the auction trying to prepare himself for...|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^5S|
hs|ss|mb|5S|
nt|Fred chose to pull to 5@S (you probably worked that out since we told you that Fred was the declarer of this deal). Sheri's double suggested enough strength in the club suit that 5@C was very unlikely to be making. Still, Fred did not expect 5@C to necessarily fail by much. Fred judged that he was still a favorite to be making 5@S, but that he should give up on slam. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


mb|D|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|nt|West doubled, suggesting that he disagreed with Fred's assessment, and 5@S doubled became the final contract. Note that Fred's slow approach to the South hand was not very successful in terms of helping him to know how high to bid. Maybe the information that he had learned would help him in the play of the hand... |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


ls|ss|pc|H3|
hs|ns|hs|nd|nt|West's opening lead was the @H3 (3rd and 5th best) and Sheri put down some nice cards in the dummy (probably more than Fred deserved). Sheri's spade and diamond holdings were enough for her to think that 5@S might be making, |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|nd|hs|nc|at|but her clubs gave her reason to believe that the penalty against 5@C doubled would represent adequate compensation for her side's game.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


ls|nc|nt|Sheri's 1NT response with "only" 5 HCP was quite aggressive, but Fred and Sheri do not pass each other's opening bids very often (partly because this makes life harder for the opponents, but also partly because Fred and Sheri obviously open some very strong hands with 1 of a suit!).|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


pc|H2|pc|HQ|hs|sh|nt|East played the @HQ to the first trick and Fred won his @HA. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


ls|sh|pc|HA|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|at|Obviously the contract is secure unless 3 diamond tricks have to be lost. Think about how you would play this hand as declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt|When Fred played this deal he chose to play a diamond towards dummy's @DQ at trick 2. |

hs|wd|hs|ed|hs|es|hs|ws|at|Given the actual lie of the defenders' spades and diamonds, there was no way for them to prevent Fred from eventually ruffing the 4th round of diamonds in the dummy. |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |

nt|The mathematics that would be required to choose between the 3 lines of play on this deal would not be trivial, especially as "human factors" must be considered. For example, Fred based his final decision largely on West's double of 5@S. Fred thought that West must have the diamonds locked up - if West's values were in hearts or clubs he would not have doubled 5@S.|
pg| ***** 95 ***** |


hs|eh|hs|wh|ls|nd|ls|sd|ls|wd|ls|ed|nt|We do not mean to suggest that we agree with West's double of 5@S, but Fred's assumption that this double was based on diamonds seems reasonable. While we are on the subject of West's bidding, we would have bid 4@H over 3@H with West's hand. It turns out that East-West should be bidding to at least the 5-level on this deal, but they should be playing in hearts, not clubs. |
pg| ***** 96 ***** |


hs|nc|nt|5@H would make on a good day, but fails by 1 trick on the actual layout due to the North's club holding. In fact, par on this deal is 6@H doubled by East, down 500 (against 5@S which makes against any defense). |
pg| ***** 97 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|wh|hs|ec|hs|wc|at|Despite the 5-0 trump break, 5@C doubled would have been down only 2 or 3 tricks (depending on whether Fred figured out to lead to a low diamond at any point in the play).|
pg| ***** 98 ***** |


hs|wh|ls|nc|hs|eh|nt|West probably expected his partner to be at least 5-5 for his 4@C bid. Otherwise, given West's pass over 3@H, it is surely better for West to bid 4NT (as a choice between hearts and clubs) instead of 5@C. East would bid 5@C over 4NT with 5-5 distribution, but he would bid 5@H with his actual hand, finding the superior trump fit. |
pg| ***** 99 ***** |


ls|wh|ls|wc|nt|There is a strong case to be made for East's 4@C bid "promising" at least 5 cards in that suit as East could bid 3NT instead of 4@C to suggest long hearts with a 4-card minor on the side. This sounds good in theory. In practice, however, East really wants to let his partner know what his second suit is. An "unusual 3NT" does not get the job done (although it might work on this deal).|
