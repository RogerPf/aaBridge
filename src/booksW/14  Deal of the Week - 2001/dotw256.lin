bt||nt||cs|3|at|
^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 256 - August 6, 2001^*N }
^-
This week's deal is a declarer play problem based on a deal that was randomly dealt on ^*BBridge Base Online^*N, the new ^*Bfree^*N online bridge game that was developed by ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N This particular deal took place in a duplicate IMP game (duplicate matchpoints, rubber, total points, and minibridge scoring are also available on ^*BBridge Base Online^*N).

As you will see, our random deal generator is capable of producing some fascinating deals, but ^*BBridge Base Online^*N also allows for the play of non-random deals. The software allows you to play prepared lesson deals or the deals that were played in major tournaments. In the later case, you can IMP your results against those that were originally achieved.

East opens 3@C at unfavorable vulnerability (the vulnerability is shown in the graphic at the top left - red is vulnerable and white is not vulnerable). This is passed around to your partner who balances with double. What call would you make as South at IMP scoring?|

lb|*BWhat call would you make?^^3s|
hs|ss|mb|3S|
nt|We would bid 3@S in real life, but we would not be at all surprised if pass turned out to be the winning action at the table (or in a simulation). We are big believers in taking out partner's takeout doubles, but this may be partly a function of temperament. We can live without collecting the occasional +500 or +800, but it is really nice to never have to write down -670!|

ls|ss|nt|If you passed then you have our admiration and you would have achieved a fine result on the actual layout of the cards. However, you would have missed an interesting declarer play problem. |

pc|C2|
nt|West's opening lead is the @C2, suggesting 3 cards in that suit, but East is a very conservative player and you can assume that he has both the @CA and the @CK for his vulnerable 3@C opening. Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|This is a really complicated hand. Your general plan should be to try to draw trump and set up dummy's diamond suit, |

ls|ns|ls|ss|hs|sc|ls|nd|at|but the lack of entries to the South hand and the danger of losing some club tricks late in the play are serious concerns. |

ls|sc|hs|nh|hs|ns|nt|It could be right to either ruff the opening lead in dummy or to discard a heart instead. Strangely enough, it is the location of the missing diamond honors that determines the winning play at trick 1. |
