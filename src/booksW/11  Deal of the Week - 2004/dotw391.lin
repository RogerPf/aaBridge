^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 391 - March 8, 2004^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played on Sunday in the last segment of the ^*BCamrose Trophy Finals^*N, a yearly tournament involving England, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. This year's winner was England - congratulations!

The actual declarer did not find one of the winning lines of play. See if you would have done better.

The next ^*Blive^*N vugraph broadcast on ^*BBridge Base Online^*N (^*BBBO^*N) will be from the ^*BACBL North American Bridge Championships^*N in Reno, Nevada. At this point in time we are planning to cover only the ^*BVanderbilt Final^*N on March 27, but that could change. As more information becomes available it will be posted on the following web page:

|cs|2|at|^-{ ^*Hwww.bridgebase.com/online/vg.html^*N }
^-
The ^*BEuropean Championships^*N will be held over a 15-day period in June in Malmo, Sweden. We are planning on producing ^*Blive^*N vugraph broadcasts of every session of this event, but we are expecting our expenses to be in the range of $5000 (almost all of this goes to paying our vugraph operators' travel, hotel, and food).

We are trying to find a corporate sponsor to help cover our costs. In return we can offer a lot of publicity and the appreciation of many thousands of bridge players from all over the world. If you are involved in a company that might be interested, please e-mail me: ^*Bfred@@bridgebase.com^*N.

hs|sc|nt|In this week's deal the actual North-South pair was using a strong 1@C system. After East passed in first position, South's 2@C opening described a hand with 11-15 HCP and at least 5 clubs. |

ls|nd|ls|sc|pc|D4|pc|DT|pc|cj|pc|da|at|The good news was that the @DA came down |

hs|sc|nt|There are a few ways to make the contract. Here is the solution that I consider to be the prettiest: Instead of ruffing the third round of diamonds, |

ls|sc|Hs|sh|Hs|ss|at|The declarer should have discarded either a heart or a spade from his hand! |

ls|eh|pc|hj|hs|sh|at|and South must play his @HK as a spade lead from East's side of the table would be fatal. |

ls|ws|pc|sk|at|Can you see what the declarer has to do in order to make 5@C from here? |

mc|11|hs|nd|at|The defense is now dead as there is no way for West to prevent the declarer from setting up and cashing the dummy's diamonds. |

pg| ***** 68 ***** |


hs|ws|at|This line leaves the declarer firmly in control. In fact, West's situation is even more desperate this time. Leading the @SK has no real effect in this play sequence. |
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


ls|ws|pc|sk|hs|ns|nt|Having already ruffed a round of diamonds, the declarer does not have to duck the @SK anymore (but doing so would not hurt him). After winning the @SA, |
