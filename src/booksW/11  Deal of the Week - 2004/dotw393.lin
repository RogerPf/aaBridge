^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 393 - Final Deal of the Week^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
I am sorry to inform you that this may be the last ^*BDeal of the Week^*N. The main reason for this decision is that I have been writing this column for almost 8 years now and I am getting tired of it. Writing the ^*BDeal of the Week^*N was fun for years, but recently it seems more like a chore. I have not been satisfied with the quality of recent ^*BDeals of the Week^*N and I have been making more than my fair share of errors in analysis. On top of all of that, I have so much going on in my life these days that having a few extra hours each week is something I could really use.

I know this will not be a popular decision as many thousands of people view every ^*BDeal of the Week^*N and I have received a great deal of positive e-mail over the years. It is possible I will put out a "special edition" of ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N every once in a while or that eventually I will return to writing this column on a weekly basis, but that doesn't rate to happen any time soon.

Thanks to all of my faithful readers and to the many people who took the trouble to send me interesting deals or to let me know about errors in my analysis! Special thanks go out to ^*BSheri Winestock^*N who has been my editor since day 1 and to ^*BLex de Groot^*N who has translated over 200 past ^*BDeals of the Week^*N into Dutch and who has also been a big help in terms of editing.

Since this may be the last ^*BDeal of the Week^*N, I figured I should make it a special one. Thanks to my Bulgarian friend ^*BKalin Karaivanov^*N for showing me this beautiful deal. This week's deal is presented as a 3-part problem. Parts 1 and 2 are not very difficult, but part 3 is really something. In fact, I would say it is the nicest problem I have seen in years. Enjoy!

Do yourself a favor: if you do not ^*Bknow^*N you have the right answer, take some more time and try to figure it out. It is rare to encounter a bridge problem as wonderful as this one and, believe me, you will feel good about yourself if and when you figure out the solution! |
