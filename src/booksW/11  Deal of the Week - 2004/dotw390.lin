^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 390 - March 1, 2004^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
I was the declarer when this week's deal was played at an ACBL Regional tournament that took place last week in Houston, Texas. My partner was my good friend ^*BMarc Jacobus^*N when this week's deal was played.

Regular readers of this column know that I prefer to play relatively simple and natural bidding systems. Last week I tried something new - Marc and I played a strong 1@C system based loosely on ^*BPrecision^*N. The whole thing was Marc's idea and I have to admit that I was sceptical when he first suggested that we use a non-natural bidding system.

I know a lot of bridge players, but I know very few who are either as kind or as naturally gifted at bridge as Marc is. That in itself was enough to ensure that playing with him would be enjoyable,  but our bidding system experiment further enchanced the experience - I found myself in new situations facing new bidding problems that I had never had to consider before. 

It's not that bridge was getting stale for me or anything. I still feel that I learn something just about every time I play and I fully expect this to continue for as long as I can breathe. The Houston tournament was unusual in that I learned a lot in a relatively short period of time. I have Marc Jacobus and the bidding system that he wanted to play to thank for this.

The 3rd round of the Camrose Trophy will be broadcast ^*Blive^*N from Dundee, Scotland on March 6-7 on ^*BBridge Base Online^*N (^*BBBO^*N). This round will feature Scotland vs. England and Northern Ireland vs. Wales. One table from each of these matches will always be covered and expert commentary will be provided at both tables. Session starting times are posted on the following web page:

^-
Speaking of session starting times, it should be noted that the tournament organizers changed the session starting times in order to better accomodate online viewers in North America. To the best of my knowledge this is the first time that the schedule of a bridge tournament has ever been impacted by Internet vugraph considerations. Thanks to the tournament organizers (and especially ^*BMargaret Pemble^*N who has been the driving force behind the Camrose vugraph shows) for their thoughtfulness, support, and hard work!

Toward the end of March we will produce a vugraph broadcast of the Finals of the ^*BVanderbilt Cup^*N (and possibly earlier rounds) ^*Blive^*N from the ACBL North American Championships in Reno, Nevada. When more information is available it will be posted on the web page above and in upcoming ^*BDeals of the Week^*N. In order to watch any of the ^*Blive^*N broadcasts, you have to download and install the ^*Bfree^*N software for ^*BBridge Base Online^*N. This can be done through:

hc|hkjskjdkca|nt|The strong 1@C bidding system that Marc and I were playing had no impact on the auction of this week's deal. Marc and I were playing 14-16 notrumps, a slightly lower range than the 15-17 that I normally play, but this 15-count is a 1NT opening in either system. |

nt||ls|sh|pc|D3|hs|nh|Hs|sh|at|West's opening lead was a @D3 (the defenders were using 4th best leads). Mark put down a lovely dummy, but our hands did not fit very well and, although 4@H looked to be a favorite, it was not hard to imagine that I might go down. |

at|Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|Ss|nt|East's spade shift certainly didn't hurt me, but it didn't given away that much - I had more than one possible way to avoid losing a spade trick. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|hs|nh|hs|sh|at|It looked like I would have to either guess the position of the @HQ |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|hs|nc|hs|sc|at|or guess how to play clubs for 1 loser (if that was even possible) in order to make my contract. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|I found a nice line that largely eliminated the need for guessing. I continued with a strange finesse of the @SJ. I was certain that East held the @SQ (West would have played that card on the last trick if he had it) so there was no way this finesse was going to lose. |

nt|It may not be immediately obvious what the spade finesse had to gain. Actually I suspected it had nothing to gain since East's trick 2 return of the @S3 suggested that he been dealt a 3 or 4-card spade suit - it was unlikely that East would falsecard. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


hs|sd|hs|ns|at|Just in case East had 5 spades, however, I thought it would be a good idea to discard a spade from dummy on my @DK. |

pg| ***** 35 ***** |


ls|wc|hs|nh|hs|sh|hs|wh|at|There are a couple of ways this might work. For one thing I might have just cashed the @HA and @HK next, guaranteeing the contract against 3-2 hearts. That would have been fatal here. |

hs|es|hs|nh|hs|sh|hs|wh|At|and I would be left in a position where I would have to guess the location of the @HQ (or the location of the @S9) to make my contract. Would I have guessed right? I have no idea - I am glad I didn't have to!|
