bt||
ht|f|cp||at|^aTBONE - Warren Buffett, often called the "Sage of Omaha", a noted philanthropist and legendary businessman.

ht|f|cp||at|^aNotes for the user:|
at|^^|cp||at|^a|
at|^^|cp||at|^aIn order to encourage the user to try to evaluate, bid and play every hand yourself a few features have been added:|
at|^^|cp||at|^a|
at|^^|cp||at|^a   |
at|^a@2|cp||at|During the bidding only the actual hand (the one that is to bid) is displayed.|
at|^^|cp||at|^a|
at|^^|cp||at|^aAt the end of the auction only the hand of the leader is shown.|
at|^^|cp||at|^a|
at|^^|cp||at|^aDuring the play you can see only declarer's hand (and dummy, of course).|
at|^^|cp||at|^a|
at|^^|cp||at|^aYou can display any hand at any time if you click on the player's name.|
at|^^|cp||at|^aDouble clicking the name will show all hands.|
at|^^|cp||at|^a|
at|^^|cp||at|^aAfter the hand is played you can repeat it on your own playing all four hands, trick by trick.|

at|^^|cp||at|^aFRED: An exciting hand to start with! 6@d is an attractive contract here, but not easy to bid. On the actual lie of the cards, 6@d will fail but it would take a heart lead, a losing finesse, and a spade switch for that to happen. That would be unlucky!|

at|^^|cp||at|^aFRED: 4NT by Uday would mean "What is your minor?" - it could not logically be Blackwood in this auction (since Uday already signed off in 4@h). If Uday was 2344 for example, he would prefer to play in the 9-card minor suit fit at the 5-level versus the 8-card heart fit.|

ht|a|cp||at|^aUDAY: Partner will not assume I am bidding Blackwood, since I only bid 4H the last time. We both know that P has another suit and that I don't know what it is. Thus, I would hope that he would use the opportunity (on the way to 5H) to show his suit. He won't know why I am curious, and he won't care. Sometimes it might be better to play 5 of his suit (for instance, I might have had 3 hearts and 4-4 in each minor).|

at|^^|cp||at|^aFRED: Michaels is not really about points. And the type of hands you should bid Michaels with depends heavily on the vulnerability and partnership style. If not vul versus vul, you could easily bid Michaels with very few HCP (3 or 4) if you had a lot of distribution (like 6-6).|

ht|a|cp||at|^aFRED: Note Uday had "only" 14 HCP, but chose to open 1NT (15-17 in their non-partnership). It is common practice among experts to "upgrade" certain 14 HCP hands and open 1NT (same for certain 19 HCP hands and 20-21 2NT). The idea is that some 14 point hands are better than some 15 point hands.|

The 5-card suit, good spot cards, and lots of Aces make the first hand better than its point count suggests. The 2nd hand, with none of the above qualities, is worse than its point count suggests.|

ht|a|cp||at|^aQ: Why didn't West basically ignore the 1H overcall and bid @s?|
at|^^|cp||at|^aFRED: Here Sharon's DBL is called a "negative double". It is a convention that shows exactly 4-cards in spades. If Sharon had 5 or more spades she would have bid 1@s instead. This is a good hand for the negative DBL because it made Warren's rebid (his Pass) easy. Knowing his partner had only 4 cards in spades, Warren knew he should not raise with only 3-card support.|

at|^^|cp||at|^aFRED: Expect to stay confused - it is not so easy... But you can make some rules with your regular partnership. For example: all undiscussed doubles are for penalties. That is a useful sort of rule to have. Then you can decide which non-penalty DBLs you want to play. You already know about at least one of these I expect: the takeout double. Decide with your partner when it applies.|

ht|a|cp||at|^aFRED: For example: "If they open the bidding below 4@h, then DBL by us is for takeout". It takes some work before you and your partner are usually on the same wavelength at the table. For beginners I suggest forgetting about learning any really fancy DBLs. Penalty, takeout, and possibly negative are all you need for now. If you don't have a regular partner, try to talk with your teacher or mentor about coming up with some good rules for when DBL means what.|

at|^^|cp||at|^aSHARONO: A free bid of 2@c in that position should show at least 6-card suit.|
at|^^|cp||at|^aFRED: Often the best bid is Pass - Warren had nothing to say at his 2nd turn and that is exactly the message his Pass sent to his partner. He had already opened the bidding so he had no extra high card values in his hand. And he had no special distribution to mention either.|

ht|a|cp||at|^aQ: Why double with 3 weak spades? |
at|^^|cp||at|^aFRED: I like Sharon's action - nowadays especially it is important to get into the bidding quickly on such hands. So many people open light, respond on nothing, and preempt in many auctions that, if you don't bid aggressively in response you are in danger of getting shut out of many auctions.|

ht|a|cp||at|^aFRED: Also, when the opening bid is 1@c (as opposed to 1 of anything else) you can afford to be a little lighter for your takeout DBLs (because your partnership retains complete flexibility with respect to playing at the 1-level). If the opening bid had been 1@s instead, it would be much more dangerous to DBL with Sharon's sort of hand (because such a DBL forces partner to bid at the 2-level).|
