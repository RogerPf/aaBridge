ht|g|cp||at|^aOn August 31, 2008 the BIL was proud to Host the BBO founder for the 5th Birthday Celebration session.|
at|^^|cp||at|^a|
at|^^|cp||at|^aOur Guest was *FRED - Fred Gitelman - widely recognised as one of the world's top bridge players, he has been the winner of many prestigious events. Fred is special - his bridge programs have made a major difference to hundreds of thousands of bridge players. He has been active in promoting Junior bridge. He is a talented writer. He has served on many important bridge committees. He has coached some of America's international team. In 2005 he was made the ACBL Honorary Member of the Year. Fred began his programming career at age 12! It was from Fred's vision that BBO was conceived.|
at|^^|cp||at|^a|
at|^^|cp||at|^aFor this occasion a special BIL 5th Birthday INDY tourney "Think with Fred" was organised. Fred was playing and at each round change he commented on the previous board. The boards were randomly dealt. *FRED had not previously seen the boards and all his bidding comments are based on SAYC.|
at|^^|cp||at|^a|
at|^^|cp||at|^aThe top two Beginners and top two Intermediates received cash prizes in addition to BBO Masterpoints and a number of random cash prizes were awarded.|

Who would have thought it on that day you wrote and said "I have set up your Private Club". The members and I thank you for that - well LOL some days I am not so sure :).|
