For this occasion a special BIL 5th Birthday INDY tourney "Think with Fred" was organised. Fred was playing and at each round change he commented on the previous board. The boards were randomly dealt. *FRED had not previously seen the boards and all his bidding comments are based on SAYC.

The top two Beginners and top two Intermediates received cash prizes in addition to BBO Masterpoints and a number of random cash prizes were awarded.|

BILMANAGER: A very Warm WELCOME   FRED  it is wonderful to have you with us again today as we celebrate this special birthday - 5 years! Who would have thought it on that day you wrote and said "I have set up your Private Club". The members and I thank you for that - well LOL some days I am not so sure :).

FRED: Hi everyone! Thanks to all of you for helping to celebrate BIL's 5th birthday :).

You are all lucky that we have not added the ability to sing through BBO or you would all have to hear me sing Happy Birthday to Maureen and the BIL :)|

nt|It wasn't really convenient for me to talk about the last hand at the time, so we will start with that one first. You can see that 4@H is really the contract of choice here. NS are off 2 spade tricks and, with the diamond finesse losing, you REALLY don't want to go trying for slam and ending up in 5@H. So how should the bidding go?|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |

sk|W|mb|p|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


sk|N|
mb|2N|an|?|nt|I suppose some North's might look at their balanced 20-count and open 2NT...|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at| I would actually recommend that bid if the North hand was slightly different ie with 5332 distribution. I am a believer in opening 1NT with 5332 even if the 5-card suit is a major. Same goes for 2NT. But with 5422, I have a strong tendency to bid my suits. You can always get to notrump after opening 1@H, but it is a lot harder to get back to hearts after opening notrump :)|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


ub||
nt|So let's undo that 2NT opener and bid 1@H instead.|
mb|1H|

sk|E|mb|p|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


sk|S|at|
Now here is a mistake that I sometimes see new players make...
|mb|1S|an|mistake!|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|True, you have 4-spades and you might have a 4-4 spade fit but... I very much prefer to support right away with a hand like south's - you already KNOW you have a heart fit, so there is really no need to complicate matters by bidding the (yucky!) 4-card spade suit here.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


at||
ub||mb|2H|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


sk|W|mb|p|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


sk|N|nt|So now the question becomes.... Can North contain himself (or herself!) and not get too high despite having so many points?|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at| I think the answer should be yes - although North certainly is going to force to game...
The North hand has too many "holes" to really consider getting to slam despite all those points.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt|I am not sure how I can convince you of this except to ask you to think about whether or not you can possibly construct ANY hand for South such that:
1) 6@H is a good contract
and
2) Your partner made the correct bid with 2@H.

I am betting that you can't think of such a hand :)|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


sk|S|nt|Look at the actual South hand for example - it is very much a maximum for 2@H and almost all the high cards are pulling their weight, but it is not even close to being enough to produce a slam.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


sk|N|nt|This technique of "trying to think of possible hands for partner and then imagining how the play will go" is not something that new players are typically taught, but it is a very powerful method of figuring out how much a given hand *really* is worth. We are all taught to rely heavily on HCP count and to a certain extent that is a good thing but we have also all seen hands in which a great slam is present with only 25 points or a great game contract is present with only 20 points.|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|The fact of the matter is that, at the highest levels, HCP count is really only a guide
what really matters is tricks, not points. And the better you get at bridge, the more you will rely on "thinking about possible hands for partner" and the less you will rely on simply counting points.|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|In this particular case, point count will also get the job done - you *know* there can't be enough points for slam. But if I change things slightly....|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


md|0,,d2,sQ|
at| North has one less spade (get rid of @sQ) and one more diamond... That would be FEWER HCP, but the North hand would in fact be a stronger hand. Now you might imagine partner possibly having enough high cards in the right places for slam, even though the HCPs you supposedly need (33) are not really close to being there.|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|At this stage of your careers as bridge players I am not suggesting you get overly concerned with such things, but it will leave you in a good position for the future if you can appreciate some of the thinking patterns that go on inside the mysterious brains of expert players :)|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


md|0,,sQ,d2|
nt|Anyways, I am claiming that the correct bid on the actual North hand is....

pg| ***** 23 ***** |

Well that was a mouthful :)|

We saw many examples of this type of thinking today. For example...

"Is my hand strong enough to overcall?"
|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |

"Is my suit strong enough to preempt?"
|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |

"Should I open 1NT with a 5-card major?"
|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


at|
"What suit should I lead?"
|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


at|
I can offer you OPINIONs, but I am not quite arrogant enough to claim that my opinions represent FACTs (at least in most cases).

If you asked the same questions to a different expert, he or she might well give you different answers. Really the most important thing is that your partner is on the same wavelength.

Let me give you some examples....|

rh||ah|Board 01|
sv|n|pf||sk|N|nt|Here is the first board from our tournament. I personally believe in opening 1NT with the North hand, despite the beautiful 5-card major. I believe that nowadays most USA experts would agree with me, but there are parts of the world where the experts would all consider it heresy to open anything other than 1@S.|
mb|1N|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt|Really what matters is that you know what to expect from your partner. So if you start playing regularly with the same person... discuss these things!|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


sk||nt|Ask your partner: "Do you open 1NT with a 5-card major, always, never, or does it depend?"
If it depends, discuss what it depends on - maybe you will decide not to do it if your suit contains the AKQ (for example), or maybe you will only do it if your suit is very weak. Whatever you decide is ok - just decide something and stick with it.|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |

qx|B04, Board 04|
pn||st||md|2SJH57QKAD26JC2459,S24TQH49JD48TC7TK,S79KAH8TD5QC368QA,|
rh||ah|Board 04|
sv|b|pf||sk|N|mb|p|nt|On Board 4 there were a couple of situations like this... First, should North open 1NT?
|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


at|The hand has the perfect number of HCP and it is fairly balanced. So on a certain level it is hard to be too critical of the 1NT opening.|
mb|1N|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


ub||
nt|That being said, I personally believe that it is better to open 1@C on this particular hand. It is not the "2 doubletons" that bothers me for 1NT....|mb|1C|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


sk||at| The reason I like 1@C instead is because this rates to be an easy hand to bid if you open 1@C - you rate to be able to bid a very comfortable 1@S next...|
mb|p1Hp1S|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt|However... if the North hand had 4 hearts instead of 4 spades, it would be different (let South has a nice spade suit instead of a nice heart suit).|
ub|3|md|0sAK,,hAK|md|0s8,,,h7|mb|1sp|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


at| Now the North hand has a real bidding problem. As you will learn (if you have not already) to bid 2@H is a "reverse" - it shows more than 15 HCP.|mb|2H|an|mistake!|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


ub||
mb|2c|an|?|at| You could conceivably bid 2@C, but with such a ratty suit and with 15 HCP, that choice is not very appealling.|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


ub|5|mb|1n|
nt|Better to get your points off your chest and bid 1NT the first time. But really that should be seen as a opinion - not a fact (though in this particular case it is a pretty strong opinion!)|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


ub|1|md|0hAK,,sAK|md|0h7,,,s8|mb|1c|
sk|E|nt|Here is a less strong opinion that I have about this hand. It concerns the East hand - should you overcall 1@D or not?|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


mb|p|at| I can't say that I have any strong convictions that I am "right" but... on this hand I chose to Pass.|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|However... I suspect that roughly 50% of the world experts would disagree with me :). I personally like to have more than just a nice suit to make a vulnerable overcall. But I can tell you that those Italian who keep winning the World Championships would think that I was crazy if they heard me say this :).|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


sk||at| So I hope that none of them are in the audience!|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


%% ------------------------------

%% ---------- BOARD 07 ----------
qx|B07, Board 07|
pn||st||md|1S49H2359JD38TKC9K,S3HKAD467JAC2367Q,S78TQAH68TD259C4A,|
rh||ah|Board 07|
sv|b|pf||sk|N|nt|A few hands later I faced a similar problem.... Again we were vulnerable and again my partner was a passed hand.|mb|p1D|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


mb|1S|at| But this time I did overcall on a rather marginal hand.|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|In some sense this hand is better than the last one - it has more HCP for sure. But it is worse in the sense that I had 5332 distribution - the worst possible shape given that you have a 5-card suit (at least the other hand had the redeeming quality of having a singleton!). However, there are some additional reasons (in my opinion at least) for overcalling on this hand...|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|One is that 1@S is a more preemptive bid than 1@D - so there are more tactical advantages to bidding.|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


at| Another is, if the hand is to be a partscore battle, it is more important to bid majors than it is to bid minors: the majors tend to win such battles :).|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


at| Another reason is the side Ace - that means that should the opponents end up in notrump and should I be able to convince my partner to lead my suit I have an extra chance to be able to regain the lead and run my suit.|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


sk||nt|So in my mind I can justify overcalling with this hand and passing with the other hand. But it shouldn't really matter if you think my justification is valid or not. Make sure that your partner knows what the worst hand he/she can expect when YOU overcall - that is what matters.|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |

rh||ah|Board 05|
sv|n|pf||sk|E|mb|p|nt|One more example of the same type of thinking is on hand 5. Should East open 2@H?|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


at| If you were taught that a weak 2-bid shows 6-10 HCP and says nothing about suit quality, then of course!|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


at| But maybe you were taught by a particular teacher who advocates "You must have 2 of the top 3 honors!"|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


at| Or a different teacher who told you "You must have 3 of the top 5 honors!"|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


nt|Both of these teachers can't be right :) even though they both might be very good teachers!|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


at| Really the way to explain this is that neither of them is "right" because there is no "right" - there are only "agreements".|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


at| If you think your teacher is smart then by all means use the agreements that he/she suggests. But if you and your partner want to let your hair down a little and open 2@H more often than you are now, don't let your teacher stop you :).|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


mb|2h|nt|I personally think 2@H is a perfectly acceptable bid with the East hand, but only if not vulnerable. However, if I was playing with a partner who expected me to always hold 2 of the top 3 honors for a weak 2, then 2@H would be a TERRIBLE bid.|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


at| I would prefer to play with a partner who was less stringent about such things, but I have found that it is a useful quality as a bridge player to be flexible when it comes to making partner comfortable.|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


sk||nt|It turns out that on this particular hand 2@H hits a home run. West is actually in a position now to think that hearts should be trump - something it would be hard for him to imagine otherwise.
|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


at|But really the result is neither here nor there - one hand does not prove anything. Just because 2@H happens to be brilliant on this hand, that does not make it "right".
So another lesson that you will find valuable...|

pg| ***** 66 ***** |

qx|B02, Board 02|

rh||ah|Board 02|
sv|n|pf||nt|This was an interesting hand, partly because nobody real makes much of anything! Probably the best contract is a spade partial for EW on the 4-3 fit, but hard for me to think of a reasonable auction that will end up in spades...|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


sk|E|mb|1c|nt|I was sitting West on that one. My partner opened 1@C as East|
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


sk|S|mb|1h|at| and the next hand overcalled 1@H. True that it is nice to have a better suit than J9xxx for a vulnerable overcall, but the South hand had enough in the way of HCP to make up for the yucky suit :).|
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


sk|W|nt|Now I had a tricky problem... With 7 HCP I really wanted to make some bid, but all of my choices were flawed... Not enough spades for a negative double (or to bid 1@S if you don't play negative doubles) and 1NT was not too appealing for a few reasons:|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


nt|1) I did not really have much of a heart stopper!
2) I had a singleton in my partner's suit and normally I would have a more balanced hand for 1NT in this position.
3) I really was quite minimum in terms of HCP for 1NT.
|
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


at|So given all the other flaws I decided not to stretch. I therefore passed.|mb|p|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


sk|N|nt|At some other tables, that might have resulted in 1@H being the final contract, not a very pleasant spot to play in! But North at my table made a very brave call by bidding 1NT himself! Full marks to him for a bid that I have to admit that I would have been too much of a chicken to make myself.|mb|1nppp|sk||
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


nt|If there is no 1@H overcall, it is normal for the West hand to respond 1@D, but some prefer to bid the major first with hands like mine. Regardless of what West responds, however, East should rebid 1@S and that should end the auction I think. So it is possible for EW to get to their best fit (spades) but only if South doesn't overcall and I really think South should overcall with a full opening bid despite the poor heart suit.|
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


nt|A takeout DBL by South versus a 1@H overcall is not unreasonable, but it is not a bid for me. I tend to prefer overcalling (versus takeout dbl) when I have a 5-card major, but I suppose that is really a matter of partnership style.|

nt|I am not sure I want to say much more about that hand since I expect my face is still somewhat red given my embarrassing defense in front of dozens of kibitzers. But one thing about bridge that is SUPER important:
You need to be able to put your bad results in the past where they belong! Focusing on bad things can only hurt your performance on the next hand :)|

pg| ***** 81 ***** |


nt|You might be getting sick of my saying things like this but... Again I can't claim that my failure to bid Stayman was "right" with any great confidence. This is something I happen to believe in - don't bid Stayman with 4333 hands. But many good players would disagree.|
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


nt|You would think it would not matter whether I bid Stayman or not, but had I done so it would have been reasonable for  South to double my 2@C holding AQxxxxx. If that had happened, it would have been easier for North to stay on the spade lead which is hard to criticize, but is not good for the defense on this particular hand.|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


nt|Turns out my North was very clever and managed to stay off a spade lead without any help from partner! His heart lead kept the defense alive, but it was still hard for them to come out on top. In the end declarer prevailed and did very well to make his 3NT.|
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


nt|Good point by a kibitzer: not vulnerable I think it is very reasonable for North to show the majors over 1NT. Perhaps not a happy decision on this particular hand - if you do that you might well get doubled and go down a few tricks. Not that such a result would necessarily be a disaster - when the opponents are vul and might make a game, you can afford to go down a few tricks DBLed when you are not vul.|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


nt|That being said, if you want to wait for a better hand to act over the opp's 1NT, I can't say I blame you :). Being not vulnerable is not the same as being invulnerable :).

I would be happy to answer some questions for a little while.|

But I believe quite strongly that beginners and intermediates should spend less time learning
 about conventions and more time learning about things like how to count the hand and how
 to evaluate when their hand is worth more or less than their point count.

These are the skills that really matter in bridge.

Once you get good at that, you can spend the rest of your lives learning
whatever conventions you want.

And by then you will have developed the ability to decide for yourself
which conventions are good :).

mb|2H|nt|Given that East did bid 1NT... I think I would have Passed as South as well. 2@H is very dangerous with such a weak suit and with the @DK as a questionable value (because diamonds were bid on your left) you really wouldn't be happy to hear it go DBL-P-P after you bid 2@H - you could go down a LOT with the opps not making anything.|
pg| ***** 99 ***** |


mb|x|nt|And I suspect I would have bid 3@C, not DBL, on the West cards given the way the bidding actually started. In general you should have more than 2 trumps to make a penalty DBL at a low level like this.|
pg| ***** 100 ***** |


mb|p2Np3Nppp|nt|So overall I would say I am not enamoured with the bidding you presented :). But it does look like it is hard for the defense to beat 3NT. That's kind of a miracle as it turns out. So if I was sitting EW on this hand... and we failed to bid to our unbeatable 3NT... I would not lose any sleep over it :).|
pg| ***** 101 ***** |


nt|Q: Part of the reason you'd pass 1@S is that you'd expect your partner to double on shortage if opponent didn't raise @Ss?
A: That is part of the reason but... even if partner doesn't DBL, I will probably be happy having started with Pass. Sometimes partner won't have the right shape to reopen with DBL.|
pg| ***** 102 ***** |


nt|For example, he could be 2254 and with that it would be too dangerous to reopen with DBL - without heart support he should just Pass out 1@S. That would be just fine with me :). The opps would then have an 8-card heart fit and be playing in their 6-card spade fit instead with me having KJxxx over the spade bidder. Sometimes you don't need to double them in order to get a good board.|
pg| ***** 103 ***** |


nt|But another reason not to bid 1NT... When you do bid 1NT, partner will normally expect a more balanced hand. He might take out to 2@D expecting you to have at least 2-card support
and you really don't want him to do that. That is why I said I would be more inclined to bid 1NT if I had 5323 instead - I would then have the support for partner's diamonds that he would normally expect about reopening with DBLs.|
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


ub|13|mb|p1D1Spp|nt|Let's say the bidding starts this way (which I think is totally reasonable). I would not reopen with a DBL on the West hand even though I am short in spades.|
pg| ***** 105 ***** |


mb|2c|at I would prefer 2@C because, when you DBL, you do not know partner is going to Pass. Sometimes he will actually bid one of the suits you are supposed to have support for! And neither of us would be happy if I were to DBL and he was to bid 2@H.|
pg| ***** 106 ***** |


nt|This is one area of bidding that there is a lot of confusion among new players. In fact, there was recently a heated discussion on BBO Forums (^*Hforums.bridgebase.com/index.php^*N) about this very topic.
Some new players have been taught that opener ALWAYS reopens with DBL. Some have been taught that the ALWAYS is not quite so strong... ALWAYS REOPEN IF YOU ARE SHORT.|
pg| ***** 107 ***** |


nt|My personal view is this: reopen with DBL if you can handle whatever partner does :). On this hand I would not DBL because I cannot handle it if partner bids hearts. So I would bid 2@C instead :).
But let me emphasize, that we are back in the territory of "judgment" or "agreement" versus "right". I am sure there are plenty of good players who would disagree with me here.|
pg| ***** 108 ***** |


mb|p3c|nt|I think it is OK for East to bid 3@C. If this is how the bidding goes then West should Pass next. He has nothing extra for the bidding so far.|
pg| ***** 109 ***** |


nt|Q: Wouldn't it be better for West to pass 1st up and wait for one round - as it is a nothing hand, as it has no NT shape nor 6 cards in minors nor 15HCP nor 4-4 in majors?

A: It is an interesting idea but... once your hand is sufficiently strong in terms of HCP, you really have to open. Otherwise there is too much of a danger that there won't be a later :)|
pg| ***** 110 ***** |


nt|Q: Our E-W opponents bid and made 5@C, was it bad defence?

A: Bad defense with all the cards in view for sure :). But entirely possible that nobody did anything unreasonable just looking at their own hands. For example, it might take the @SA opening lead to defeat 5@C and that would be a tough opening lead to find!|
pg| ***** 111 ***** |


nt|If it turned out that North led a heart and that was the only "mistake" that NS made, I would say "unlucky" :). However, if the defense was given a 2nd (or 3rd) chance to take their @SA and failed to take it, that would be less understandable :).|
