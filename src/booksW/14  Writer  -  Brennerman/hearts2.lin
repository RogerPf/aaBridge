ht|f|fp||at|^b @2 ^z@3Our semester continues with Lesson 2.

Today we look at opening leads against suit contracts.

The title of this course is ^*uThe ACBL Heart Series - Defense^*  by Audrey Grant.

Her copyrights apply as 99% of what I present is her wording and property.

Her comprehensive text is appropriate for the advancing player.

It is well worth purchasing and I hope you do.There is much in it that I do not cover.

Please remember this is a lecture and can become lengthy.

Another thing you need to know is that this lecture abbreviates the Grant text.

It is more than an introduction, not something you read once and understand completely.

Good Bridge requires lots of study and work.|

ht|e|fp||at|^B@2^Z@3In ths lesson, we will look at making opening leads against a suit contract.

Many of the guidelines for selecting the card you lead in a suit contract 
are also used in leads against notrump contracts.

When selecting the suit to lead, however, there are some new considerations.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


AT|

You no longer focus your attention entirely on long suits.

After all declarer, chose to play in a trump suit so that you would not be able to enjoy winners in your long suits.

The presence of a trump suit has a great influence on the way declarer plays the hand
and it also influences the way the defenders try to defeat the contract.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


AT|

Your focus now shifts to the strength of your suits - the high cards you hold.

You want to try to get the tricks to which you are entitled before declarer can trump your high cards or discard cards that would lose to your high cards.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3In a suit contract, declarer usually plans to trump some of his losers in the dummy
or discard them on winners in other suits.

Of course, two can play that game.

The defenders have a chance to trump declarer's winners in a suit contract,
so short suits can become a source of tricks for the defenders.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


AT|

Let's start by considering how the defender on opening lead chooses the suit
that gives his side the best chance of defeating the contract.|

nt|^b@2^z@3 
Leading from a long suit|at| against a notrump contract is usually the best idea even if you sacrifice a trick in the process.|

Declarer can trump them.|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3 Notice that declarer would approach this suit from the point of losers rather than winners in a trump contract.|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


at|
When you are defending, you must be careful not to lead a suit that will help declarer eliminate some of his losers in the suit.|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3 As we pointed out in the previous lesson,  the defenders cannot see into each other's hands.|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |

That is why imagination, or visualization, has to play an important part.|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


md||Nt|^b@2^z@3Let's look at some suits and see whether or not you should lead them against a suit contract.|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3 When you are actually defending, you will have to imagine the layout of the remaining cards, but you may be able to establish some general principles.|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3 Compare what would happen if you lead each of the suits against a notrump contract
and against a suit contract (assuming another suit is trumps).|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3 Look at the number of winners you are likely to get if you lead the suit and the number of tricks you sacrifice by leading the suit.|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Would you normally lead the suit against a notrump contract, a suit contract, or both?|

pg| ***** 62 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Against a notrump contract, you are willing to sacrifice one trick since you can end up developing three tricks.|

Against a suit contract, however, you will have sacrificed that trick in vain.|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Declarer would have ended up with no losers in the suit, rather than the one he started with.|

Declarer can trump any further leads of the suit in his hand.|

By leading this suit, you are not helping declarer, since you are getting only the tricks to which you are entitled.|

PG| ***** 110 ***** |


at|^B@2^Z@3Against a suit contract, the emphasis is on developing tricks, from your strong suit
rather than long suits.

You want to avoid leading a suit which sacrifices a trick.

The best choice of suits is often the one in which the partnership has combined strength.

Since you cannot see partner's hand, suits in which you have a strong sequence are usually safe to lead.|

PG| ***** 112 ***** |


at|^b@2^z@3Although declarer's trump suit usually works to his advantage, the defenders can sometimes use the trump suit to their advantage by ruffing declarer's winners.

Leading a short suit-- a singleton or doubleton, hoping partner can return the suit for you to ruff is often a good choice against a suit contract.|
pg| ***** 113 ***** |


at|

Many players, including experienced players, automatically lead a singleton against a suit contract.

This is not always the best choice since leading a singleton involves some risk.

You may be helping declarer establish one of his suits.|
pg| ***** 114 ***** |


at|

Let's look at the type of conditions that make the lead of a singleton effective.|
pg| ***** 115 ***** |


md||bg||ha|Y|tu||nt||st||sv|0|rh||ah|Lesson 2|ah|Exercise 2|st||nt||bg||md|3,S874H3DJ873CT8652|
pg| ***** 116 ***** |


Nt|^b@2^z@3You are on lead after the bidding goes:|
pg| ***** 117 ***** |


ha||sd|s|mb|pp1sp2sp4sppp|
pg| ***** 118 ***** |


ha|y|nt|^b@2^Z@3Your Diamond and Club suits are not particularly appealing,  so you might consider leading your singleton Heart on this type of hand.|
pg| ***** 119 ***** |


Nt|^b@2^z@3For this to work, partner must be able to win a trick before all of your trumps are drawn and lead a Heart for you to ruff.|
pg| ***** 120 ***** |


at|

Let's see if that is a good possibility.|
pg| ***** 121 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3How many points do the opponents have?|
pg| ***** 122 ***** |


at|    Probably between 26 and 32.|
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


at|

How many points do you have?|
pg| ***** 124 ***** |


at|    One, plus one for the 5th Club.|
pg| ***** 125 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3How many points do you expect partner to have?|
pg| ***** 126 ***** |


at|    About 8-15.|
pg| ***** 127 ***** |


at|

Is it reasonable to expect partner to be able to take the first trick or an early trump so that he can lead a Heart for you to trump?|
pg| ***** 128 ***** |


at|     Yes.|
pg| ***** 129 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3So this would be a good time to lead a singleton Heart.|
pg| ***** 130 ***** |


at| 

You hope partner will win the first trick and lead a Heart for you to trump.|
pg| ***** 131 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3If he has another entry to his hand, you may be able to get a second ruff and defeat the contract, despite your lack of high cards.|
pg| ***** 132 ***** |


Nt|^b@2^z@3Now let's change the hand slightly and exchange your Spades for the KQJ.|
pg| ***** 133 ***** |

PG| ***** 134 ***** |


ha||mb|pp1sp2sp4sppp|
pg| ***** 135 ***** |


ha|y|ls|ws|at|^b@2^z@3 There are enough high cards missing that you could still expect partner to win a trick and give you a ruff if you lead your singleton.|
pg| ***** 136 ***** |


at| 

Will that gain anything to your side?|
pg| ***** 137 ***** |


at|    No. |
pg| ***** 138 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3You expect 2 trump tricks anyway.|
pg| ***** 139 ***** |


at|

There is not much point in leading a singleton when you have natural trump tricks.|
pg| ***** 140 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3You would be better off to lead another suit in an attempt to create tricks for the defense elsewhere.|
pg| ***** 141 ***** |


at|^b@2^z@3 

Let's look at another hand.|
pg| ***** 142 ***** |


nt||md|3,s874h3dja78cakqt8|
PG| ***** 143 ***** |


ha|Y|ST||nt|^B@2^Z@3The bidding proceeds: |bg||
pg| ***** 144 ***** |


ha||mb|pp1sp2sp4sppp|
pg| ***** 145 ***** |


ha|y|at|^b @2 ^z@3

Can you expect partner to have enough strength to win an early trick and give you a ruff before trumps are drawn?|
pg| ***** 146 ***** |


at|    No.|
pg| ***** 147 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Partner can have very few points since you have 14 HCP and the opponents have at least 26 points.|
pg| ***** 148 ***** |


Nt|^b@2^z@3 In this situation, leading your singleton would be a poor choice.|
pg| ***** 149 ***** |


at|

If partner can win a trick, you are likely to defeat the contract anyway and you just might help the declarer find some missing card such as the @hQ.|
pg| ***** 150 ***** |


hc|ca|Nt|^b@2^z@3 You have a much better choice in the @cA.|
pg| ***** 151 ***** |


at|

If that wins a trick, you can reconsider leading your singleton after looking at the dummy.|
pg| ***** 152 ***** |


lc|ca|nt|^B@2^Z@3More likely, you may be able to give your partner a ruff if he is short in Clubs!|
pg| ***** 153 ***** |


at|

Let's look at one more example.|
pg| ***** 154 ***** |


nt||md|3,s8742h3dj87cakqt8 |
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


ST||nt|^B@2^Z@3The contract is the same.|bg||
pg| ***** 156 ***** |


ha||mb|pp1sp2sp4sppp|
pg| ***** 157 ***** |


ha|Y|nt|^b @2 ^z@3The singleton Heart may again have some appeal, but when you have a lot of trumps, there is another consideration.|
pg| ***** 158 ***** |


at|

How many trumps is declarer likely to hold?|
pg| ***** 159 ***** |


at|    About 5.|
pg| ***** 160 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3If you start leading your high Clubs, either they will take tricks or declarer may have to trump to stop you from taking tricks.|
pg| ***** 161 ***** |


Nt|^b@2^z@3 How many trumps would declarer have left if he started with 5 and had to ruff one of your Club winners?|
pg| ***** 162 ***** |


at|    Four.|
pg| ***** 163 ***** |


at| 

So if he has to draw all of your trumps, how many will he have left?|
pg| ***** 164 ***** |


at|    None.|
pg| ***** 165 ***** |


Nt|^b@2^z@3 When declarer has no trumps left and your side regains the lead, you will be able to take any winners you have and declarer will be powerless to stop you.|
pg| ***** 166 ***** |


at|

Declarer may lose control of the hand.|
pg| ***** 167 ***** |


Nt|^b@2^z@3 So, when you have a lot of trumps, it is often a good idea to lead your long suit, rather than your short suit, and hope to run declarer out of trumps.|
pg| ***** 168 ***** |


at|

If you can force him to ruff a couple of times, you may end up with more trumps than he has.|
pg| ***** 169 ***** |


Nt|^b@2^z@3 Now that we have looked at why you might lead a singleton and why you might not, let's see if we can put the knowledge into practice.|
pg| ***** 170 ***** |


md||nt|^B@2^Z@3You are defending a contract of 4@s with no other suits bid during the auction.|
pg| ***** 171 ***** |

at|^b@2^z@3Often a singleton is a good lead against a suit contract.

However, before you automatically lead a singleton just because you have one, consider two things:

     (1) whether you can reasonably expect your partner to be able to return the suit before 
     declarer gets rid of your trump cards, and;

     (2) whether you will gain anything if partner can lead the suit back.

If you have natural trump tricks or a lot of trumps, you are probably better off to look elsewhere for your tricks.|

AT|^b@2^z@3You may have heard the expression ^*iwhen in doubt, lead trumps.^*


Actually, the opposite sentiment is probably more accurate.

You should lead trumps only when you have a reason for doing so.

There are two main reasons for leading a trump.|
pg| ***** 190 ***** |


at|

The first is that declarer will often want to trump some of his losers in the dummy.

He will need enough trumps in the dummy to do that.

By leading trumps, you start eliminating dummy's fuffing ability.

If you regain the lead, you may be able to lead trumps again - declarer may never be able to ruff enough losers.|
pg| ***** 191 ***** |


nt|^B@2
The other reason for leading a trump is because leads in all other suits appear to be unsafe.

As we saw earlier, you try to avoid giving up a trick when defending against a suit contract since you may never get the trick back.

If the opponents have shown strength in all the outside suits, it may be best to lead a trump.

That way you leave all the work to the declarer.|
pg| ***** 192 ***** |


at|

Otherwise, you should avoid leading a trump since it will probably help declarer.

Remember that the declarer usually wants to draw trumps before going about his business of taking his winners and discarding his losers.

Having the opening lead is an advantage for your side.

Do not lead a trump if there is anything better to do.|
pg| ***** 193 ***** |


at| 

How do you know if declarer is planning to trump some losers in the dummy?

Listen to what the opponents bid and try to construct a picture of their hands.

Some auctions will give us more information, some less, so you have to pay attention.|

at|^b@2^z@3As you start paying more attention to the auction, you will start to recognize the opportunities for leading trumps to prevent declarer from ruffing losers.

Otherwise, lead a trump only if everything else looks too dangerous.

Try not to be "in doubt" when you choose to lead a trump.|

at|^B@2^Z@3As we have just seen, sometimes the bidding gives you ideas about what suit to choose for the opening lead.

If your partner has bid a suit, either against a notrump or a suit contract, then you usually choose that suit to lead.

Otherwise, an unbid suit is still a good choice.|
PG| ***** 198 ***** |


at|

A suit with a strong sequence offers a good chance to promote winners for your side.

It is usually safer than leading away from an honor.

If nothing else looks attractive, you can lead a trump.|

at|^B@2^Z@3When you are making the opening lead, it may seem as if, all you have to go on are 13 cards you see.

After all, you are the only player during the hand who has to choose a card without seeing the dummy first.

However, the bidding often makes your decision easier.|
pg| ***** 218 ***** |

If partner has bid a suit, you can lead that.

Otherwise, you tend to lead an unbid suit preferably one with touching high cards.

Sometimes a singleton or a trump may be attractive.|

There are two main differencesa between leading against a suit and a notrump contract

Against ^*Bnotrump^*  contracts, you lead the top of a ^*Bthree-card^*  or longer sequence otherwise you lead a low card (fourth highest).

Against a ^*Bsuit^*  contract, you lead the top of ^*btwo-card^*  or longer sequences.|

at|^B@2^Z@3When leading against a suit contract choose the top card of a two-card or longer sequence. 

f your suit is headed by an Ace, lead the Ace rather than away from it.

When you are leading, use the information that the bidding gives you.

Generally it is a good idea to lead your partner's suit and to avoid the opponents' suits.|
pg| ***** 284 ***** |


at|

Favor your strong sequences.

You should also consider the lead of a singleton or a trump.

Make your best effort and remember that choosing the best lead is a guess at any time.

Even world champions would love sometimes to play the hand over again with a different opening lead.|
