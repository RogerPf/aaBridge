Her comprehensive text is appropriate for the advancing player.

It is well worth purchasing and I hope you do.There is much in it that I do not cover.

Another thing you need to know is that this lecture abbreviates the Grant text.

fp||AT|^b @2 ^z@3In this course, Grant spotlights defense, an area most players say is the most challenging.

You are trying to work together as a team to defeat declarer's contract yet you cannot see the cards in each other's hands.

It may seem as if you and your partner have to be clairvoyant .

The plan is not clear for the defenders, and when the hand is over you may ask yourself:|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


at|

"Could we have defeated that contract?"|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt||fp|2|at|^B@2^Z@3
This all begins with the opening lead. |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


fp||at|

In this course, we will look at ways you and your partner can work together effectively to defeat declarer's contract.|

at|^B@2^Z@3

The experts say opening leads can make the difference between winning and losing a world championship.

What a responsibility, especially when the lead has to be made before the dummy comes down and you can see only the thirteen cards in your hand!

Fortunately, there are some standard guidelines for opening leads.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


AT|

In this lesson, we will consider opening leads agains notrump contracts.

One of the guidelines for leading against a notrump contract is to lead the fourth highest, or fourth best, from your longest and strongest suit.

This is good advice, but like most advice, it works best when used at the right time and place.|

PG| ***** 23 ***** |


at|^B@2^Z@3One of the most popular maxims for leading against a notrump contract is to lead the fourth highest from your longest and strongest suit.

When defending against notrump contracts, it is a good idea to develop the longest suit in the defenders' ^*Bcombined^*  hands.

The longer the suit, the more winners can be developed.|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


at|

Since there is no trump suit, declarer cannot stop you from taking your winners once you get the opportunity to play them.

You are looking at only your thirteen cards when you make the opening lead, so it may be difficult to determine which is the longest suit in the combined hands.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


nT|^B@2^Z@3The bidding, however, may give you some information.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


at|

If your partner has bid, your first choice is to lead partner’s suit.

After all, if a suit is good enough to bid, it is likely good enough to lead - to say nothing of what it does for your partner’s appreciation of your thoughtfulness in leading his suit.

Partner will open or overcall his longest suit first, so that may be the longest combined suit.

In addition, if partner has bid, he is likely to have the entries needed to establish his suit and take his winners.|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


at|

You don’t want to give the opponents the same pleasure.

If they have bid a suit, it is best to stay away from it unless your cards are very strong. |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


aT|^B @2 ^Z@3

With nothing else to guide you, choose an unbid suit.

If you are on opening lead against a notrump contract and your partner has not bid, choose your longest suit, hoping it is the partnership’s longest combined suit.

With a choice of long suits, you normally choose the stronger, since it probably will require less help from partner to establish.|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Finally, it is important to consider the level of the contract which the opponents have reached.

If the opponents have arrived at a contract of 6NT and you have two Aces, take a page from declarer's book and ^*itake your tricks and run!^*|

At|^b @2 ^z@3The opening lead is your chance to get a head start in the race to establish enough winners to defeat the contract.

You try to open the suit with the best potential for your side.

Hopefully it is the suit partner bid or your longest suit.

Avoid leading a suit bid by the opponents; you will likely have difficulty in that suit.|

at|^B @2 ^Z@3
Once you decide on the suit to lead,  the specific card is important for two reasons: to send messages and to make trick-taking easy.

The defenders cannot see each other's cards, so beginning with the opening lead, messages are sent with chosen cards to make things easy.|

ls|es|md|1642,k8,jt5,aq973,|nt|^B@2^Z@3West must remember: just as declarer plays the high card from the short side so must the defender.|
pg| ***** 102 ***** |


at|

Defender does it blindly and with great trust in his partner.|
pg| ***** 103 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3When leading partner's suit, the ^*Bfirst suggestion^*  is to lead the ^*Btop of a doubleton,^*  which is effectively playing the high card from the short side.|
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


at|

Now let's change the layout slightly.|
pg| ***** 105 ***** |


nt||md|3sjt5,k42,aq973,86|
pg| ***** 106 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3If you are declarer sitting South how would you play this suit?|
pg| ***** 107 ***** |


at| 

You could start with the Jack or 10 because they are ^*Iequal^*  cards.|
pg| ***** 108 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3When defending, each card sends a message.|
pg| ***** 109 ***** |


md|386,sjt5,k42,aq973|
pg| ***** 110 ***** |


at| 
(Once again I rotated the cards).|
pg| ***** 111 ***** |


at|

Declarer could play either the Jack or 10, since they are ^*Iequal^*  cards.|
pg| ***** 112 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3However, as a defender lead the top of touching honors, the Jack.|
pg| ***** 113 ***** |


at|

This tells partner that you do not have the next higher card, the Queen in this example.|
pg| ***** 114 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3If you lead the 10, partner might think declarer holds the Jack, rather than you.|
pg| ***** 115 ***** |


wt|w|pc|sts|
pg| ***** 116 ***** |


at| 

East will probably play the Queen.|
pg| ***** 117 ***** |


pc|sqs|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3This may cost defense a trick later.|
pg| ***** 119 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3So the ^*Bsecond guideline^*  is to lead the ^*Btop of touching honors.^*|
pg| ***** 120 ***** |

If you do not have a doubleton or touching honors lead low. |
pg| ***** 121 ***** |


nt|^B@2^Z@3Let's change the layout again to see why leading low works best.|

Nevertheless, by leading low the defenders manage to trap declarer's Queen.|

nt|^B@2^Z@3So the^*B third guideline^*  is to lead ^*Blow from three cards,^*  if you have no touching honors.|

If this suit has a ^*Bthree-card^*  or longer sequence, lead the top card.

AT|^B @2 ^Z@3Against a notrump contract, with no help from the bidding, lead your longest suit.

With a choice of equal length suits, pick the stronger.

If you do not have a three card sequence, lead a low card, usually fourth best.

Now you know the origin of the guideline:^*i fourth best from your longest and strongest.^*n|
pg| ***** 349 ***** |


At| 

When you are deciding on the suit the bidding can often guide you.

The opponents describe their hands to each other to reach their best contract.

As they talk back and forth, there is nothing to stop you from listening.

The auction may tell you which suits to avoid and point you in the direction of the best lead.|
