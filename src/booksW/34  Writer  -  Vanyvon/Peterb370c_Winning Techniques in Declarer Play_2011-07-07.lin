at|Peter Brennan: The purpose of this course is to acquaint you with some useful tools when you declare a hand. Hopefully, by seeing a number of examples in random order you'll recognize these situations when they pop up in your game.  

Each hand features a common challenge of some sort:  dealing with bad suit breaks, handling tricky entry situations, making inferences from the bidding or play, counting enemy distribution and/or points, when to draw trumps, basic end plays, etc.

These hands should be played using IMP or rubber bridge tactics.  Don't even think of risking the contract to make a measly overtrick or two.

However with 3 red suit winners he might have doubled 5@c rather than bid 5@s.  If trumps are 2 – 1 (78%) you'll make partner look like a genius by taking 6 @ss, 1 @h, 2 @ds and 2 @d ruffs on the table but don't count on it.  Remember West bid NT.  Good luck!|

After discovering the 3 – 0 trump split we're quite grateful we didn't get a @h lead.  Since we're at the 5-level we can't afford to lose 2 @h tricks and the @sQ.  Is there a way to dump a @h loser?|

All would be well if the @dQ dropped in 3 rounds or less.  After unblocking the @dAK we'd maneuver a @d ruff in dummy and hope to see the @dQ fall.  But that's only a 34% chance.  Can we do better?  Everybody OK with this so far?|

Besides, how else can we get South to declare a NT contract?  :)
There are 10 top tricks, 2@ss, 4@hs, 3@ds and the @cA.  @s could produce 1 or even  2 extra tricks and there's the @c suit.  @c will produce 2 tricks even if the @cK is offside.  Good luck in the play!|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |

There is a way to play @s to make 3 tricks.  That's a guaranteed 3 tricks against any @s distribution; 100% of the time there are 3 @s tricks.|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


at|
There is a different @s play that will make 4 tricks almost 40% of the time.  Which play should we use?|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


at|
The correct answer is we don't know yet.  It will depend on the @c finesse.|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|If we lose the @c finesse we can't afford a @s loser, so we must play for the 40% chance.  If the @c finesse succeeds we can play @s for 3 tricks and claim our slam.  Everybody understand this point?|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |

First we try the @c finesse.|

If the @s9 loses to East's @s10 we have no worries.  That means @s are 3 – 2 and the @sQ will fall under North's @sK.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt|We see West has the @sQ10 remaining.  We cash the...|

pc|SK|pc|C3|pc|S7|pc|ST|sc|y|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


at|
Playing at Match Point scoring most declarers would take the @s finesse anyway looking for the overtrick.  If they cashed the @sK and led a low @s towards the @sAJ they would lose 2 tricks with this layout.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


at|
Better to take the finesse immediately.  It loses to West's @sQ but if declarer cashes the @sA and discovers the 4 – 1 split he has a tenace position with the @sK9 behind West's @s10x.|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


at|
One final point – how do we play @s to make 4 tricks (40%)?|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt|Basically, we play East for the @sQ.  Why only 40% and not 50%? East will hold the @sQ half the time, but with certain hands like @sQ10xx declarer will lose a trick anyway.|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


at|
The best shot is to lead low to the @sJ and hope East began with @sQx or @sQxx.|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


mc|12|at|
Here's the lesson text:  This hand presents a common theme we see all the time.  The way we play one suit depends on what happens in another suit.  Here when the @c finesse wins we can play @s for one loser.  Cash the @sA and lead towards the @sK9 intending to cover West's card.|

pg| ***** 40 ***** |


at|
This hand was played in a BIL practice session recently.  I don't remember if the declarer took the winning line of play but I saved the hand because it is a textbook example of a squeeze play.|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


at|
All of the elements required for a squeeze are here.  Declarer is one trick short and one defender must guard two suits.|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


at|
Also the declarer's “threat cards,” the @sJ and the 4th @h are in different hands.  Strictly speaking, this is not required but it makes the play easier.|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|A squeeze play operates when one defender (West in this hand) has to guard 2 suits.  Eventually, one of those suits has to be unguarded and declarer is able to pick up the needed extra trick.|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


at|
A squeeze requires declarer to “rectify the count.”  That means we must lose any trick(s) before the squeeze can operate.  The best time to do that is right now.  We can just duck this first trick.|

...the @sAK next.  Maybe East has @sQx; if so we could just claim 12 tricks.  Now we run the minor suit winners being sure to end in our hand.|pc|S2|pc|S9|pc|SA|pc|S3|

pg| ***** 58 ***** |


at|
Because we cashed the @sAK earlier we just have to look at West's discard on the @dK.  If it's the @sQ, our last 2 winners will be the @sJ and the @hA.|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |

If West keeps the @sQ, then his other card will be a @h.  Our 2 winners will be the @hA and the @h5.|
