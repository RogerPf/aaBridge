nt|This hand comes from the 1988 Olympiad, Japan (N-S) vs. Belgium.  West led a heart, and declarer won dummy's @HJ and played on clubs.  West held up the @CA for two rounds, hoping for a useful discard from his partner.  Declarer could see East would surely signal for a spade on the third club, so he switched to spades, for a very lucky 12 tricks.|

nt|1997 European Championships.  Sweden vs. Germany.  North's double of 4@S proved very costly when it not only allowed E-W to recover from their misunderstanding, but also bid a cold grand slam!|

nt|In the 1963 Bermuda Bowl final Italy faced the USA.  This deal marked the start of a comeback by Italy.  South hoped his partner would have sufficient heart length to read 3NT as 'unusual', but the bid was very risky.  Belladonna, sitting West, was not deterred from the heart lead.  The Italians sitting N-S in the other room played safely in 5@C.|

nt|In the 1993 European Championships, Norway were N-S on this deal against Switzerland.  West's aggressive 3@C bid scored an unexpected goal.  Helness (North) ruffed the second club, drew trumps, and cashed the @SA and @DAK.  Placing West with six clubs for his jump overcall, he finessed the @S10 - reasonable, but disastrous.|

nt|1996 Olympiad.  Ukraine (N-S) vs. France.  In the other room, North opened 1@C, passed round to West, who bid 2@C as a game-forcing takeout, duly passed by his partner.  Ukraine played in a 3-1 fit at one table and a 3-0 fit at the other!|

nt|This deal comes from a 1981 Camrose match.  England were N-S against Ireland.  6@DX cost 1100 and 4@H would have been two down.  East was surely wrong to bid 5@D - vulnerable against not, you should always have some expectation of making your contract.|

nt|This is a famous deal from the 1981 Bermuda Bowl final, USA-Pakistan.  In the other room, E-W played in 4@D, just making.  Here, E-W were Meckstroth-Rodwell, making their Bermuda Bowl debut, and playing the aggressive, swingy style which has become their trademark.  West, with a very difficult guess on lead, chose a spade for -750.  A club would have given the N-S pair +2200.|

nt|1995 Bermuda Bowl, Canada vs. South Africa.  West led @DA and another diamond, for -1540.  In the other room, East-West bid 6@S and North led the @CK for -1460.  When both sides have a big fit in two suits, it pays to bid 'one more' as a safety precaution, as high-level contracts can make in either direction.|
