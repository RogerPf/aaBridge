nt|This hand is from the Iceland-Ireland match in the 1991 European championships.  East led a trump and West ducked, preserving the chance of over-ruffing diamonds.  Declarer led the @SQ and West went up with the @SA - not unreasonable, as declarer could have had a singleton @SK.  East is more to blame - a singleton trump is a poor lead against a small slam.  Had East led a straightforward @CQ, the problem would never have arisen.|

nt|In a 1933 England-USA match, Beasley-Domville were N-S against Culbertson-Lightner.  South bid 2@H to show a good hand with club support but North thought it was natural.  This misunderstanding was very costly because in 1933, vulnerable undoubled undertricks cost 250 each!|

nt|In the 1972 Olympiad the Multi-2@D was just making its debut and even top players had trouble with it.  E-W were Garozzo-Forquet for Italy, facing Flint-Cansino for England.  Forquet's 4@H bid was very impractical because there was a big danger partner might take it as natural.  6@c was bid and made at the other table.|

nt|This hand is from the 1997 European championships.  Iceland (E-W) faced Portugal.  North led the @cQ, got in with the @HA and underled the @DA, trying to reach his partner for a ruff.  This was unlucky - South was quite likely to hold the @DK - but it's worth remembering that such underleads do carry considerable risk.|

nt|In the 2007 Bermuda Bowl final, Zia-Rosenberg sitting E-W for the USA faced Helgemo-Helness of Norway.  Zia led a trump and declarer claimed 13 tricks.  This killed a promising comeback by the American team.|

nt|In the 1997 Vanderbilt final, Jimmy Cayne cashed a top diamond from dummy.  This caters to singleton @DQ offside but loses to @DQxxx onside - four times as likely.  The auction was confused and Cayne, thinking about what had gone wrong, didn't give the play his full attention.  The moral:- always concentrate on the contract you are actually playing!|

nt|In the 1995 English Spring Foursomes, all the players on this hand were top internationals.  North led the @SA and switched to a diamond.  South ruffed and drew trumps.  Declarer (Roman Smolski) was squeezed, for 9 down: -5200.  N-S at the other table bid the spade slam and were disappointed to lose 23 imps on the board.|

nt|This was the last board of the 2003 Bermuda Bowl final between Italy and USA.  North went four down in 4@h in the other room.  Here, East, disgusted with his partner's bidding, left the table.  North led the @cA, then switched to a heart.  Declarer took two ruffs then led the @SK.  East won and played another spade but declarer ducked without thinking, and was not allowed to change his card.  This cost 12 imps and Italy lost by 1 imp.|
