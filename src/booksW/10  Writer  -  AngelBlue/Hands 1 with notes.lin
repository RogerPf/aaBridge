nt|In the 1991 European Championships ^*iseven^*n teams bid these N-S cards to a grand slam.  (The Poles, striving for perfection, bid 7NT.)|

nt|In the 1989 Venice Cup semi-final Germany were about 30 imps up against Holland with 15 boards to go.  North thought 4@C was 'pass or correct' but South thought it was showing clubs.  On a spade lead declarer got two ruffs for 'only' -1700.  This board shattered the German morale and they eventually lost by 21 imps.|

nt|In the 1993 Bermuda Bowl semi-final, Brazil vs. Norway, Brazil were 9 imps ahead going into this, the last board.  West led the @HA, cashed the @CA and then switched to a spade.  5@CX made and Norway went into the final.|

nt|In the 1980 Junior European Championships, Peter Splettstosser of Germany played a comfortable-looking 3NT on this deal.  He won the diamond lead in hand, played the @CQ to @CA, @S10 to @SA, and ran the @HJ.  West won and returned a diamond, knocking out dummy's entry before the hearts could be unblocked.  One down.|

nt|In this deal from the 1998 Macallan Pairs Zia-Robson (N-S) faced Helgemo-Helness (E-W).  Declarer was a little unlucky, as the bidding wasn't too unreasonable.  The defence ran the diamonds, then the hearts, then the @CA.  Seven down, -2000.|

nt|In the 1998 Cavendish International Pairs Gitelman-Moss (N-S) faced Quantin-Abecassis (E-W) on this hand.  South led the @C10.  Declarer won the @CA, cashed the @HA and led a spade.  South won and continued with the @C7.  North assumed this was from @C10987 and ducked.|

nt|In the 1983 Bermuda Bowl final, Italy led USA by 8 imps with two boards to go.  N-S here were Belladonna-Garozzo, probably the best pair in the world at the time.  Belladonna thought that 3@S was a 'trump asking bid', and his 4NT was intended to show his spade holding, but Garozzo of course took it as Blackwood.  This disaster cost the championship.|

nt|This was the most spectacular board in the 1989 USA-Holland Venice Cup final.  West's double proved very costly when 7NT made.  (East avoided the spade lead, but when declarer ran the clubs West was squeezed in spades and diamonds.)  At the other table, the USA N-S scored +1390 in 6@C ^*i(N-S were actually vulnerable)^*n.  Doubling 7@D therefore led to a loss of 15 imps, when passing would have netted a gain of 17!|
