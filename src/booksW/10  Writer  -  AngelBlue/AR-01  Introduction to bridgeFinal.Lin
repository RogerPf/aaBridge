ht|h|at|^bIt is not my intention to tell you how bridge is fun, fascinating, pleasureful, delightful, satisfying,|   
ht|i|at|^bexciting, enjoyable, gratifying, skillful, beneficial, intelligent, social,  prestigious, universal…|  
ht|j|at|^beasy to learn.| 
ht|l|at|^bWhy? Because very soon you will discover that anyway.|
ht|n|at|^bOh, oh, I did it, didn’t I? Sorry, could not resist…|
ht|p|at|^bCould YOU resist talking about such an amazing gift?|
ht|r|at|^bAnd there is something I should mention: you must be familiar with high Math –|
ht|t|at|^byou must be able to count up to thirteen!!!|
ht|v|at|^bNow... where is that arrow when I need it? Oh well, click on yours then.|

When you play at home, each player deals the cards in turn, clockwise.
(On BBO the cards are dealt by the program. That's a good reason to play there).

Each of the four players is dealt 13 cards. This is the exact quarter of a deck.

The 13 cards held by a player is called a "Hand".

In turn, each player plays a card from his hand, clockwise. 

The highest card wins.

These four cards are called a "Trick". 

When playing to a trick, all players must follow the leader's suit if they have a card in that suit.

If a player runs out of that suit, and only then, may he discard 
a worthless card from another suit.
A card that has been discarded, cannot win a trick, no matter how high it is.
(Later I will show a second option of a play when a player is out of the suit that has been led.)

The player who wins a trick, leads to the next trick. 

The game is over when all the 13 tricks have been played.

In a bridge game, there is always one player who plays the hand.

This player is called "Declarer". In all my examples South will be declarer.

The partner of the declarer is called "Dummy".

Of course, that has nothing to do with his intelligence.

It just means that this player has to be silent during the game.

The player on declarer's left plays a card to start the first trick. This player is called "Leader" 

and the card that the leader plays to the first trick is called "Opening lead".

The dummy does not hold his cards like the others.

After the opening lead hits the table, he lays them down on the table, suit by suit, face up.

To prevent confusion, the red and black suits are laid down alternately, 
and if a suit contract is played, the trump suit is placed to dummy's right.

On BBO this is done by the program. Another good reason to play there!

A bridge contract is reached by an "Auction". 

A Bridge auction is a sequence of bids. 

A bid aims to pass information about the values of a player's cards.

This in order to help the partnership reach the 
optimal contract with the cards they have been dealt.

There are two different types of bridge contracts:

^g1. NO TRUMP contracts, in which all the four suits are equal 
and the highest card always wins.

^g2. SUIT contracts, in which one of the four suits is a supreme suit. 
We call it the "Trump suit".

This movie is not intended to teach you how to perform a bridge auction.

Therefore, all my notes will refer only to the 
general rules of the bidding procedure. 

And in my example hands I will set only the final contract.

As you already know, there are 13 tricks in a bridge game.


Since half of 13 is 6½, the bid starts by a commitment to a minimum of 7 tricks.


The first six tricks are taken for granted.


To make the bidding comfortable, the first six tricks stay unmentioned.


It is also to facilitate non math experts (like me).


Therefore, the bidding always starts at the seventh level.


And since the first six tricks are unmentioned, we use the 


numbers 1-7 to commit ourselves to 7-13 tricks respectively.

The auction is over after three passes in a row; 

and then:

If the last bid prior to the three passes was a suit, 

this suit becomes the trump,

and the player who first mentioned the suit, becomes declarer.

If the last bid prior to the three passes was NT, 

the game will be played in NT contract, 

and the player who first mentioned NT, becomes declarer.

A bridge teacher is called over to a table at one of his classes

but 4th hand had 17 high card points. 
"So why did you pass?" asks the teacher.

mn|The ruffing process|
bg|8|
ht|f|fp|1|cp|2|at|^bThe superiority of the trump suit is expressed by its ruffing-power potential. This potential can be|
ht|g|at|^bused after a side suit in a player's hand runs out of cards, and this side suit is played for the current trick.| 
ht|i|at|^bIn this case, this player may win the trick by using one of his trumps for a "Ruff".| 
ht|k|at|^bUsing the ruffing power is a privilege of all the three active players (dummy's cards are played by declarer).| 
ht|m|at|^bIt is real fun, but by no means a must! Actually, in some cases you may profit by avoiding a ruff|
ht|o|at|^bYou must bear in mind that your opponents can also use their trumps effectively. To prevent them|
ht|p|at|^bfrom doing that, you may consider drawing their trumps by playing the suit at a suitable moment.|  
ht|q|at|^bThe play of the trump suit must then obey the general rule as in "following suit".|
ht|s|at|^bNow, move to the next page to see illustrations of the ruffing process.|

In a beginners’ game declarer calls the teacher over to the table 
and tells him she is playing a slam contract and after she has won the opening lead 
she played the ace and ruffed a diamond, 
ruffed a heart and ruffed a diamond. The teacher, impressed by the brilliant play, 
asks her why he has been called over.  
The declarer replied: "because the contract is 6NT".

ht|f|fp|1|at|^dWinning bridge is first of all being a good partner. Pay attention to the following:|
ht|g|fp||at|^dDo not give lessons, unless you are being paid to do so.|
ht|h|at|^dNever say anything to your partner unless you would want him to say the same to you.| 
ht|i|at|^dNever criticize your partner for a normal action just because it did not work this time.|
ht|j|at|^dUnless your intent is to clear up a misunderstanding, avoid discussing the hand just played.| 
ht|k|at|^dRemember – you and your partner are on the same side.|
ht|l|at|^dDo not forget that your partner wants to win as much as you do.|
ht|m|at|^dDo not ever criticize or embarrass your partner in front of others.|
ht|n|at|^dRemember that bridge is only a card game.|
ht|o|at|^dHave a good time, and make sure that your partner does also.|
ht|p|at|^dTrust your partner; do not assume he has made a mistake.|
ht|q|at|^dThink twice before analyzing a hand. Do not embarrass yourself with a hasty, inaccurate comment.|
ht|r|at|^dNever side with an opponent against your partner. If you cannot support your partner, say nothing.|
ht|s|at|^dIf you think you are too good for a partner, and do not enjoy playing bridge with him, do everyone|
ht|t|at|^da favor and play with someone else. That is clearly much better than being a martyr.| 
ht|u|at|^dHowever, be careful before burning bridges – another player's grass may not be greener.|
ht|v|fp|1|at|^dAlways Remember the BIL’s Creed  –  "Cherish Your Partner and Respect the Opposition”

George, a good bridge player, was also a barber. 
One day with a customer in the chair, 
George gets a call from his bridge partner and they start talking over deal after deal. 
as the customer sits there stewing. 
Finally, he rips off the towel draped around him and dashes out of the shop. 
George runs after him shouting:  
"And don't you ever come back here again."

As you could see, bridge is a game you can play as soon 
as you acclimatize yourself to the basic procedure.

I hope this introduction to the fascinating world of bridge
has made you eager to learn more. 

It has been a great pleasure to create this movie for you. 

You should be alerted to the nature of bridge: 
Bridge is a rich, colorful and versatile game.
The more you play the more excited you become.
the more you learn the more you discover how much there is yet to learn.
The more you play the more addicted you become.

Get to know BIL and take the journey. You will find many friends along the way. 

They will soon become your extended and entertaining family.  

Use the BIL Library www.bilbridge.com to discover lessons,  articles and more bridge movies.  

And remember: if you want to study seriously to advance your understanding 
of the game quickly, you may apply for a Mentor to help you.

I am looking forward to see you online on BBO.

Success is not only measured by how many games and tournaments you win. 
In its purest sense, it occurs when you make an effort to be 
better today than you were yesterday and try to become even better tomorrow.
