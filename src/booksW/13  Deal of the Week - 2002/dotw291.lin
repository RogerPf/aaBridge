^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 291 - April 8, 2002^*N
^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
This week's deal is a defensive problem that I faced at the recent San Diego Regional. I was playing with ^*BSheri Winestock^*N in a knockout team match when this week's deal was played.

Sheri and I are pleased to announce that the World Headquarters of ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N will be moving from Toronto to Las Vegas some time in May. It may take us a little while to settle into our new home, update all of our web pages, etc. We apologize in advance if our service is slower or less reliable than usual during this transition period.

A lot of people have been asking us, "Why are you leaving Canada to live in the United States?" and "Why Las Vegas?". Bridge is a big part of the reason why we are moving to America. My regular partner, ^*BBrad Moss^*N, is an American and we would like to try to play together in future World Championships. That means we have to be living in the same country. Also, moving our business to the United States will be good for a number of reasons (lower taxes for example). Las Vegas is particularly appealing due to good real estate values, lots of friends living there, no state income tax, and good weather.

The concept of leaving Canada is strange for Sheri and me. We have both lived in Toronto all of our lives and both of our families live here. Most of my best bridge moments have come when I was playing for Canada (including my recent Gold Medal at the IOC Grand Prix in Salt Lake City). Sheri has also represented Canada in the World Championships. We will always be proud to say that we were born in Canada, but we will also be proud to call America our home.

South dealt and opened 1@S. Neither side was vulnerable and we were playing IMPs. I sure had good support for all the unbid suits. Do you think I made a takeout double?|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


lb|*MDid Fred make a takeout double?^Yes~No^2|mb|p|
nt|
Nope. I chose to pass. Do you think I considered making a takeout double?|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


lb|*MDid Fred consider making a takeout double?^Yes~No^1|nt|I must admit that I did consider it. I have made takeout doubles on 5440 hands with similar high card strength in the past. The fact that I had no sure defensive tricks certainly influenced my decision. Another reason was that I knew I would feel sick if North raised to 4@S and Sheri doubled (I try to avoid bids that might make me feel sick). The vulnerability was also major factor. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|I have heard some reasonable players make the assertion that "vulnerability is for children". That is completely absurd in my view. The vulnerability affects the scoring, which influences the expected outcomes of various bridge actions. In my view, being able to "play the vulnerability well" is a much underappreciated part of what it takes to win at bridge.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|When nobody is vulnerable, making an aggressive competitive bid is more dangerous than most players realize. If you get caught and go for a number it is almost always bad as the opponents'  300-point non-vulnerable game bonus is not worth that much. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|If it is your game bonus that is in question, it does not pay to stretch when you are not vulnerable (as the swing you gain when game makes is worth about the same as what you lose if game goes down). When you are vulnerable it is different as the 500-point game bonus makes it right to stretch to game contracts that are somewhat against the odds to make.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt|In my view, ^*BJeff Meckstroth^*N and ^*BEric Rodwell^*N understand the vulnerability better than anyone. I have learned a great deal about this aspect of the game by studying their moves. When nobody is vulnerable Jeff calls it, "the burn vulnerability". I think that sums it up very well - when you play with fire and nobody is vulnerable it is easy to get burned!|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


mb|3S|mb|P|mb|4S|mb|?|
nt|North raised to 3@S, a limit raise promising at least 4-card spade support, and South went on to 4@S. Did I consider doubling or bidding 4NT now? No. Double might give Sheri a choice between -590 and -800. I did not want to do that. Bidding 4NT rated to be very bad if 4@S was going down (and might work out badly even if 4@S was making).|

ls|ec|ls|sC|lc|ct|hs|wh|hs|wd|hs|ss|hs|nc|at|I knew that a heart or a diamond return would allow declarer to discard a club from the dummy while ruffing in his hand.

hs|ec|hs|wc|nt|Declarer's mistake of cashing both the @SA and @SK early in the play was forgiven because I had been dealt both the @CK and @CQ. If the @CK and @CQ had been split (as in the layout above), the line that the declarer took would have failed after a low club lead by me in the critical position.|

hs|nc|hs|sc|nt|There is an interesting way for declarer to recovery from the mistake of cashing both top trumps when clubs are 4-2 and the club honors are split. After stripping diamonds and playing a heart to dummy's @HA, declarer must play clubs himself! |

hs|ec|ls|sc|hs|ns|hs|ss|at|Note that declarer really should cash only 1 round of trump. If the @SA and @SK are both cashed, declarer can still get home by guessing well, but keeping trump control eliminates the need to guess the club position. |
