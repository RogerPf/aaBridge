^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 293 - April 22, 2002^*N
^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }

|cs|1|at|{ ^*BSPECIAL!!! There are 2 deals of the week this week!^*N }
^-
Both deals are declarer play problems. This week's first deal was played by ^*BBetty Ann Kennedy^*N, a bridge player who is famous not only for her skills and World Championship wins, but also for her smile and pleasant disposition at and away from the bridge table. Betty Ann played this deal in a knockout team match at the Shreveport Regional last week. Betty Ann's team ended up winning this event and one of her teammates, ^*BGreg Hinze^*N, thoughtfully forwarded this deal to us.

This week's second deal (presented after the first deal) was played in a duplicate IMP game on ^*BBridge Base Online^*N (BBO). This ^*Bentirely free^*N online bridge service has a lot more to offer besides online bridge. For example, almost 150 past ^*BDeals of the Week^*N (along with dozens of other bridge articles) are available through the ^*BBridge Library^*N area of BBO.

We are planning a series of live vugraph broadcasts through BBO in the upcoming months. Our next such production will be the ^*BCavendish Invitational^*N (both the pairs and the teams) from May 8-12. A variety of experts will provide live commentary and analysis. The Cavendish is arguably the toughest and most exciting bridge tournament there is so make sure that you don't miss this broadcast! Click on the blue rectangle below to be taken to a web site where the software to install BBO on your PC is available as a ^*Bfree^*N download.

pg| ***** 9 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|Betty Ann had won 3 tricks already and she still had 2 top winners in spades, |

ls|ns|ls|ss|hs|nd|hs|sd|at|3 in diamonds (by taking the marked finesse in that suit), |

ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|nc|hs|sc|at|and 3 in clubs. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|
hs|ns|hs|ss|at|At first glance it appears that declarer has to choose between the spade finesse |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|hs|sh|at|and playing for a 3-3 heart break in order to establish a 12th trick. Betty Ann chose to play for neither of the above.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|Betty Ann wisely reasoned that the known 6-0 diamond break made it unlikely that either major suit would be favorable for her. Furthermore, there was no hurry in deciding which major to play. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


ls|ss|ls|ns|ls|sh|hs|nd|hs|sd|at|She therefore finished the diamonds |

pc|CT|pc|H8|pc|CQ|pc|DT|at|East discarded a heart on the final club, giving Betty Ann a choice of winning plays. |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


sk||hs|sh|hs|eh|nt|She could have simply exited in hearts to East's @HK at this point to establish her 12th trick in that suit. Betty Ann is all about elegance, however, in terms of both her bridge game and her demeanor. She did not disappoint her fans on this deal, when she found a more elegant way to bring home her slam. |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


ls|sh|ls|eh|hs|ss|nt|Betty Ann cashed he @SA |

pg| ***** 28 ***** |


mc|12|hs|es|hs|ns|at|East was endplayed into leading a spade away from his @SQ into dummy's @SKJ. Betty Ann claimed the last 2 tricks and was happy to see that the @SQ was offside. Betty Ann's strip squeeze had been necessary to make the contract  - playing on either major would not have worked. |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |

hs|nh|hs|sh|hs|eh|hs|wh|nt|At the other table 6NT was also reached and West also led a diamond. The declarer at that table started the same way as Betty Ann. He won the diamond cheaply and played a heart to the @HA and a heart back to his @HQ.  He then chose to continue with a 3rd round of hearts. East was thereby able to take 2 heart tricks to defeat the contract.|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |

nt|On this week's second deal the final contract is 6@H. You may not like the bidding (and you may like it even less when you see the dummy), but, as this is a deal from ^*BBridge Base Online^*N, you would ^*Bnever^*N say an unkind word to your partner (at least that is how online bridge should be played - we are trying hard to maintain a pleasant atmosphere on BBO). |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt||pc|SJ|
hs|ns|at|West's opening lead is the @SJ and you send a nice "typ" message when you see the dummy; "typ" is an online shortform for "Thank you partner". You might as well try the @SQ, |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


ls|ns|pc|SQ|pc|SK|hs|ss|at|but East covers with the @SK and you win your @SA. |

at|Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sh|nt|The contract is not very good. The @HA has to be lost for sure, but you cannot afford to play on trumps immediately |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|hs|ns|hs|ss|at|as the defense would cash a spade trick. |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


ls|ns|hs|nc|at|The only chance is to get rid of your spade loser on dummy's clubs. |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


hs|sd|at|As dummy does not have enough clubs to take care of all 4 of your side suit losers, |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|ss|hs|nd|at|you will also need the diamond finesse.|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|nc|Hs|sc|nt|If clubs are 3-3 (and the diamond finesse wins) the contract will be easy. Proper technique will give you a slight extra chance to make the contract when clubs are 4-2. The correct play is to win the first round of clubs in dummy |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|
pc|CJ|pc|C2|pc|CA|pc|C7|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |

pg| ***** 46 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|ss|at|Now play the @C10, planning to discard a spade. If East's @C9 was a falsecard and the suit was always 3-3 you will be able to claim soon. |
