^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 328 - December 23, 2002^*N

This week's deal was played in the ^*BHolkar Pairs Finals^*N at the recent ^*BIndian Bridge Nationals^*N (the 44th running of this event) in Ludhaina, India. I would like to thank ^*BT.C. Pant^*N for sending me this deal and ^*BHoney B. Prabhakar^*N, one of India's top players, for his analysis of this fascinating deal. Most deals that appear as ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N start out with only 2 hands in view. This week's deal is not really meant to be a practical exercise so all 4 hands will be displayed right from the start. Try to figure out if the contract can be made against best defense.

I am very pleased to announce that the ^*BACBL^*N with be producing a live vugraph broadcast of the semi-finals and finals of the 2003 ^*BVanderbilt^*N through ^*BBridge Base Online^*N. As with all of the broadcasts that we make, access to this one will be ^*B100% free^*N. I am hopeful that this broadcast will be just the beginning and that we will be able to start broadcasting all of the major ACBL National events.

I would like to express my gratitude to all of the people who e-mailed the ACBL to request that they use our software for live vugraph broadcasts of their tournaments. Thanks also to the management of the ACBL for their interest in using out site for this purpose.

The 2003 Vanderbilt will not take place for a few months, but we have 2 live broadcasts scheduled on ^*BBridge Base Online^*N between now and then. Our next show will take place on January 11 at 3PM EST (21:00 GMT). At that time we will broadcast an 18-board exhibition match that will commemorate the 71th anniversary of the ^*BCulbertson-Lenz Match^*N.

This exhibition match is also the work of the ACBL and, once again, I would like to thank them for choosing ^*BBridge Base Online^*N for their coverage of this event. The original Culbertson-Lenz Match was front page news when it took place and I am hoping that this exhibition match will also generate a great deal of positive publicity for our game.

We will also be producing a live broadcast of the ^*BNEC International Bridge Festival^*N that will take place in Japan in early February. The exact times and dates of this broadcast will be announced through ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N, our web site, and ^*BBridge Base Online^*N itself as this event approaches. I normally provide live commentary and analysis during our broadcasts, but since I will be playing in the NEC tournament, I am unlikely to be available to help out with this particular live show. Other expert players will be on hand to provide their insights into the play-by-play from this prestigious tournament.

In order to watch any of these broadcasts, you will need to download and install the software for ^*BBridge Base Online^*N (which does a lot more than just allow you to watch live vugraph). The software you will need is available for ^*Bfree^*N through the following web site. Click on the blue rectangle below to be taken to this web site in a new browser window:

ls|ws|pc|s6|pc|st|pc|sj|hs|sd|at|In order to succeed he would have to ruff with his remaining high diamond. |

hs|wh|hs|nh|hs|sh|at|South can afford to lead one round of hearts now (West must not cover), |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


ls|sh|ls|wh|ls|nh|hs|nd|Hs|sd|at|but the ending is more interesting if the declarer runs the rest of his trumps at once. |

ls|nh|ls|Sh|ls|wh|pc|hq|pc|h8|pc|h5|pc|h6|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |

pg| ***** 36 ***** |


mc|11|hs|sh|hs|Sc|at|leaving the South hand high. |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


ls|sh|ls|sc|up|28|hs|wd|hs|wh|nt|That was certainly a pretty end position, but West could have prevented himself from being squeezed if he had returned either a low heart or his remaining diamond after he won the @DQ at trick 4. On either return, South would lack the necesary entries to both ruff dummy's last spade and to arrive at a favorable matrix for any type of squeeze ending.|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


ls|wh|ls|wd|up|9|hs|sd|nt|It turns out that the declarer cannot come to 11 tricks against best defense if he makes the normal play of ruffing the second round of spades with a small trump. ^*BHoney B. Prabhakar^*N came up with the brilliant thought of exploring play sequences in which the declarer makes the (admittedly, totally unrealistic) play of ruffing with the @DA or @DK on the second round of spades! |

hs|sd|nt|South's best chance against the actual layout is to lead a low diamond out of his hand as before. |

hs|wd|at|West must duck his @DQ in order to prevent the declarer from arriving at a successful squeeze ending like we saw before. |

hs|sd|nt|The declarer continues by leading another diamond |

pg| ***** 48 ***** |


ls|wd|pc|D7|pc|D8|pc|S5|

hs|nd|hs|wd|at|South's best chance now is to exit in diamonds to West's @DQ. |

pg| ***** 54 ***** |


ls|nd|hs|nh|hs|Sh|nt|The only way for the declarer to reach the dummy is with the @HA, but this move will destroy the delicate entry mechanism that the criss cross squeeze requires. |
