^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 326 - December 9, 2002^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
I always get a kick out of seeing a team of underdogs win a big event and that is exactly what happened in the 2002 Reisinger Board-A-Match Teams at the recent ACBL Fall National American Championships in Phoenix.

The winning team consisted of ^*BSteve Landen^*N-^*BPratap Rajadhyaksha^*N, ^*BAdam Wildavsky^*N-^*BDoug Doub^*N and ^*BDan Morse^*N-^*BBobby Wolff^*N. Although all 6 of these players have won North American Championship events in the past, Bobby Wolff would be the only member of this team that would be widely considered to be a superstar. In contrast, many of the other 9 teams that made it to the last day of the 2002 Reisinger contained several past World Champions. The week's deal was played by Bobby Wolff in the second Final session of the 2002 Reisinger.

Since my own team did not qualify for the Reisinger Finals, I decided at the last minute to try to broadcast this event live through ^*BBridge Base Online^*N. The ACBL and especially ^*BRick Beye^*N, the new Chief Tournament Director of the ACBL, were extremely cooperative in this regard. There is no way that the broadcast could have happened if it were not for the help and support that the ACBL provided. Despite the fact that we did not have time to announce this free live broadcast, over 200 people were watching for most of the day.

sk|s|nt|In this week's deal, ^*BBobby Wolff^*N, South, dealt with neither side vulnerable. He and his partner, ^*BDan Morse^*N, faced the great Italian pair of ^*BLorenzo Lauria^*N (East) and ^*BAlfredo Versace^*N (West) when this week's deal was played. |

nt||pc|D5|at|Lorenzo led the @D5 to the next trick. Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on. Keep in mind that board-a-match scoring is used in the Reisinger and this makes overtricks very important. 4@S is not going to go down, but you should set your sights higher than 10 tricks. How would you play to win 11 tricks as the declarer? |

ls|sh|up|40|

hs|eh|hs|ec|nt|There was some speculation in the vugraph theatre at the playing site that a heart or a club return by Lorenzo at trick 3 might have broken up Bobby's squeeze. |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|ec|Hs|ed|at|The commentators were not suggesting that East's actual low diamond return was a error, |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


ls|ed|hs|eh|hs|ec|at|but that leading another suit might have been more effective on the actual layout. |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


ls|eh|hs|sc|hs|nc|nt|It is not too hard to see that a club return by Lorenzo would not have changed anything. In Bobby's actual line, he eventually cashed the @CA and the @CK himself. Bobby would have to work a little harder for an 11th trick after a club return, but such a play by Lorenzo would not have disrupted the impending squeeze. |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


ls|ec|ls|sc|ls|nc|hs|eh|hs|sh|nt|If Lorenzo had returned a heart at trick 3, Bobby could still come to 11 tricks by winning the @HA and playing for a slightly different squeeze ending. |

ls|eh|ls|Sh|pc|ht|pc|ha|pc|h3|pc|h8|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


hs|nd|Hs|ss|at|In order to succeed, Bobby would have to ruff both of dummy's remaining diamonds in his hand |
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|ss|hs|nc|at|while making sure to preserve the @CK as a late entry to the dummy. |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


ls|nc|hs|sh|Hs|ns|nt|For example, Bobby could cross to the dummy by ruffing the @H5, |

hs|ns|hs|ss|at|He could then overtake his remaining spade honor with dummy's @SK |

pg| ***** 58 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ws|ls|sc|pc|st|pc|h6|pc|c4|pc|s8|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|sc|nt|On the lead of dummy's last spade, Bobby would discard another club from his hand |
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|sc|pc|s6|pc|h7|pc|c9|hs|wh|Hs|wc|At|and, as before, Alfredo would be squeezed in hearts and clubs. This end position is slightly different from the one that Bobby reached at the table, but the result is the same - any discard that Alfredo makes allows the declarer to score up an overtrick. |
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


ls|wh|ls|wc|up|31|hs|eh|hs|ec|nt|So either a heart or a club return by Lorenzo at trick 3 would not have helped the defense. |
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


up|4|at|It turns out that, if we go back one more trick, either a heart or a club return (and subsequent accurate defense) would make it impossible for even Bobby Wolff to come to an 11th trick. In the interests of time and space, you can work out the details yourself! |
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|ec|hs|ed|nt|This is not to suggest that Lorenzo was ^*Iwrong^*N to cash a second round of diamonds at trick 2. For one thing, it was quite possible that his partner had been dealt a singleton diamond (or some different hand with a doubleton diamond). Cashing a second round of diamonds turned out to be fatal for the defense on this deal, but Lorenzo's defense seems very normal to me!|
