^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 310 - August 19, 2002^*N
^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
When you lose a long team match by just a few IMPs, the natural reaction is to look no further than the last mistake that was made in an effort to find a way that the match could have been won. Of course there will be many deals that could have swung the match, but we otherwise rational bridge players tend to think irrationally in these circumstances.

This week's deal is one that has been torturing me for the last few weeks. From my point of view this was the critical late deal that gave me the opportunity to win in the round of 32 of the Spingold at the recent ACBL Summer NABC. I was the declarer in this week's deal and, if I had made my contract, my team would have won the match and advanced to the round of 16. As you will see, I did not make my contract and our team ended up losing the match by only 2 IMPs.

True, it is not rational or productive for me to suffer as a result of this deal (especially since I am quite sure that I took the best percentage play). Given that you are a bridge player and a competitor, however, I am sure you have been there before and that you can sympathize with the sleepless nights for me that have resulted from this week's evil deal.

sk|s|nt|I opened 2NT (20-21) as South in fourth position. My partner, ^*BBrad Moss^*N, checked for a 4-card major with his Stayman 3@C and signed off in 3NT after I denied a major with my 3@D. West, a very fine player from Sweden, thought for a good 30 seconds before he selected his opening lead. |
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


nt||pc|CK|
at|When West came out of the tank, he put the @CK on the table. |
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sc|at|That looked to be an excellent start for the defense - a low club lead would have been much more friendly! The length of time that it took West to find the @CK lead strongly suggested that his clubs were not headed by the @CKQ109, but that information was not particularly useful to me. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|hc|sadakca|nt|I had only 4 top tricks (the @SA, the @DAK, and the @CA)! |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


lc|cadaksa|hs|sh|at|It would be easy to establish 2 tricks in hearts by driving out the @HA, but that would raise my total number of tricks to only 6. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


ls|sh|hs|nd|hs|sd|at|It appeared that my only hope would be to unblock the diamonds |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|ns|hs|ss|hs|nd|at|and be able to reach the dummy's @DQ via spades. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


hs|sd|at|A 3-3 break in diamonds (or spades) might also be required...|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|nc|hs|sc|nt|Coming to 9 tricks was going to require some luck, and I would need some additional luck to be able to win 9 tricks without having the defenders win 5 tricks first (3 clubs, the @HA, and the @SK). I said goodbye to dummy's @CJ and chose to allow West's @CK to hold the first trick. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|



pc|CJ|pc|C6|pc|C2|at|East followed with the @C6, an upside down attitude signal suggesting dislike for clubs. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||pc|H9|pc|H4|pc|HA|
hs|sh|at|West's @H9 shift went to East's @HA and I chose to falsecard with the @HQ. I wanted to encourage East to play another heart (as opposed to reverting to clubs). The @HK felt too transparent, but maybe my @HQ would make East think that I had been dealt the @HKQ doubleton...|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |

pc|HQ|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


pc|CT|hs|sc|at| No such luck! East led back the @C10. Think about how you would continue as declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt|This turned out to be the critical point in the play. I gave the matter considerable thought and then ducked my @CA. This turned out to be the losing decision. Later I will discuss the reasoning behind my decision, but right now I will show you how the play actually continued. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


ls|sc|pc|C4|pc|C3|hs|nh|at|West followed with the @C3 and I discarded a heart from the dummy. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |

pc|H2|hs|sh|
nt|West came back the @H2, suggesting that he was out of clubs and that West had been dealt the @CKQ9xx. Things were looking up as I won the @HK in my hand. |

pg| ***** 18 ***** |


hs|sd|at|The @DK brought more good news. |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


ls|sd|pc|DK|pc|D8|pc|D3|pc|Dt|at|Both defenders played high diamonds to suggest an odd number of cards in that suit (as they were using upside down count signals). It looked like diamonds were 3-3.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


hs|sd|nt|I cashed the @DA |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


ls|sd|
pc|DA|pc|D2|pc|D5|pc|D4|hs|nd|at|and both defenders completed their high-lows. Relying on top-notch opponents to give you honest count signals is a dangerous business, but I strongly suspected that diamonds were 3-3 in this case. One of the defenders (the one without the @SK) didn't know that I had the @DA when I played my @DK. Surely he would give his partner an honest count signal...|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


ls|nd|hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|In any case, either diamonds were breaking or they weren't. Spades was the suit that really mattered right now. It looked like all I needed was to find West with the @SK. I led a low spade towards the dummy. |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt||ls|ns|ls|ss|pc|S4|pc|S8|
hs|ns|at|West followed with the @S8 in about half a second which did not make me feel very good. Looking on the bright side, I reminded myself that this West was capable of ducking from the @SK in about half a second. I therefore played dummy's @SQ with some hope. |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


ls|ns|pc|SQ|pc|SK|at|Hope dashed! |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|East won the @SK and I was now in serious trouble. It looked like the dummy would not be winning any tricks on this deal and that several vulnerable undertricks were likely. |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


pc|h6|hs|sh|at|East returned a heart and I won my @HJ. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |

pc|HJ|pc|H8|hs|ns|at|West followed and I discarded a spade from the dummy. |

pg| ***** 29 ***** |


hc|saca|at|I had won only 4 tricks and the @SA and @CA looked to be about it. Can you see any way to salvage a 7th trick? |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


lc|saca|sk||

hs|ss|hs|ws|nt|I was quite sure that West had been dealt 2335 distribution, so I cashed the @SA to eliminate his last card in that suit. |

pc|SA|pc|SJ|pc|S3|pc|S5|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


hs|sc|at|There were now 2 ways to come to a 7th trick, but I did not see the second way at the table. The method that I took was to exit with a low club. |

up|12|ls|ss|ls|es|hs|sc|at|The other method of salvaging a 7th trick involves cashing the @CA |

pg| ***** 46 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|wd|at|but he would have to lead a diamond to dummy's @DQ at trick 13. |mc|7|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


ls|wd|ls|nd|up|39|hs|sc|nt|We are now back at the point at which East led the @C10 and I had to decide whether to take my @CA or not. I ducked and went down. Can you see how I could have made 3NT if I had won this trick with the @CA?|

pg| ***** 69 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|hs|es|hs|ws|at|I could lead the @SQ through East to pin West's @SJ (not so difficult given West would not have ducked the @SK in this variation). Winning the last 2 spade tricks would bring my trick total up to 9 - just enough! |mc|9|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


up|35|ls|ss|ls|ns|ls|es|hs|ss|

hs|sc|ls|ss|nt|The line of play that I just described (which started with winning the @CA on the second round of the suit) appears to depend on West holding either the @SJ8 or @S108 doubleton. |
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


md|0,h2,,sj|hs|ws|at|The line just described would also work, however, if West was dealt any singleton spade (except the @SK) in a hand with 1435 distribution. |

md|0,sjsk,,h2c3|
ls|ws|hs|ec|hs|wc|hs|sc|nt|My actual line of play (the one that did not work) would have also worked on the above layout. Suppose that the clubs had been 4-3. After ducking the second round of clubs (as I did at the table), |

nt|I have to admit that I did not give the matter anywhere near this much thought at the table, but ducking the second round of clubs clearly seemed to be right when I faced this problem. My line still clearly seems to be "right" to me in the mathematical sense, but it is was certainly not right in the only sense that mattered!|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


ls|sc|up|8|nt|In any case, I think it's time for me to stop losing sleep over this deal. I am in the middle of playing 2 weeks of bridge at the World Championships in Montreal and I am sure I will find a whole bunch of new deals at this tournament that I relive in the middle of the night...|
