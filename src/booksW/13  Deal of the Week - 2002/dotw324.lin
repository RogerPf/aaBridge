^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 324 - November 25, 2002^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played by my close friend ^*BBrenda Jacobus^*N in a recent game that took place at ^*BReese Milner's^*N ranch near Los Angeles. The purpose of this game was for Reese and Brenda's husband, ^*BMarc Jacobus^*N, to get some practice in for the upcoming ACBL Fall North American Championships. Brenda's partner was ^*BGeoff Hampson^*N when she played this deal.

Both Reese and Geoff are former partners of mine and both have since gone on to win some big events. Reese (playing with Marc as his partner) was part of the team that won the 2001 Vanderbilt. The last time that I played on a team with Reese was in the 2000 World Transnational Teams in Bermuda. Marc was Reese's partner in this event as well. Our team did not quite win that one, but we did walk away with a Silver Medal.

Geoff and I were partners when we were both junior players living in Toronto. Geoff has since established himself as one of the best and most successful professional players in the United States. He has won several ACBL National Events as well as the 2000 Cavendish Teams and the 2001 World Transnational Teams. Geoff was the person who reported this week's deal to me.

My wife and business partner, ^*BSheri Winestock^*N, and I moved to Las Vegas (from Toronto) about 6 months ago. The move went about as smoothly as we could have hoped for and we really love living here. Marc and Brenda deserve a great deal of credit for this. Their help, friendship, and support made this transition much easier than it could have been. These 2 are great people as well as great bridge players!

sk|s|nt|Brenda is a very aggressive bidder, but even she could not have expected to end up as the declarer when she picked up her hand on this deal. In fact, Brenda made no aggressive bids at all in the auction, but she ended up as the declarer in a slam contract! How did this happen? |
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


mb|2C|at|As you might have guessed, it all started when her partner, Geoff, opened the bidding with 2@C. |
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


mb|P|mb|2D|an|Waiting bid|mb|P|mb|2H|an|Kokish relay|
nt|Brenda's 2@D response was an artificial waiting bid and Geoff's 2@H rebid was the ^*BKokish relay^*N. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


an|Kokish relay|mb|P|mb|2S|an|Forced response|
at|According to this convention, Brenda was forced to bid 2@S, and Geoff's next bid would describe the nature of his hand (either some hand with primary hearts or a balanced game force). |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


mb|P|mb|2N|an|Balanced game force|
at|When Geoff then bid 2NT, he suggested a balanced hand with at least 24 high card points. |

mb|P|mb|3N|at|and followed up with 3NT to offer Geoff a choice of game contracts. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


mb|P|mb|6S|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|at|Geoff had bigger things in mind, however, and jumped to 6@S which became the final contract. Brenda plays poker almost as well as she plays bridge and I suspect she was able to maintain a true poker face when Geoff unexpectedly put her in slam!|

Reese's opening lead was the @HJ and Brenda was pleased to see her partner's 28-HCP dummy. Her contract had a chance! Think about you would play as the declarer before reading on. |

pg| ***** 11 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|hs|sc|hs|nc|at|Brenda was faced with a lack of convenient entries to get to her hand to take finesses and clubs and spades. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|ls|ns|hs|nh|hs|nd|at|She was concerned about the possibility of either losing trump control or suffering an overruff if she tried to take too many heart and diamond ruffs in her hand. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|nd|ls|ss|hs|ns|nt|Brenda therefore made the good decision (which was essential on the actual lie of the cards) to give up on the spade finesse. She cashed the @SA at trick 2, hoping that either the @SK was singleton |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


ls|ns|pc|sa|hs|nc|hs|sc|at|or, more likely, that the club finesse was working and that something else good would happen to allow her to handle the 4th round of clubs. |

pg| ***** 21 ***** |


ls|ns|
pc|SJ|pc|S6|pc|S7|pc|HT|nt|Reese discarded another heart on this trick. The defensive carding in hearts strongly suggested that this suit had been distributed 4-4 between the East-West hands. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|Sc|at|Obviously Brenda needed the club finesse to have any chance of making her contract from here, but just the club finesse was not enough. How would you continue from this point? |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|nh|hs|ss|nt|Brenda ruffed a heart to get to her hand |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|ss|

pg| ***** 25 ***** |


hs|ss|at|She chose not to draw the last trump at this point (later we will explore what would have happened if she had played the @S10 here). |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


ls|ss|hs|sc|at|Instead, she chose to lead the @CJ to the next trick in the hope that Reese would be tempted to cover with the @CK. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


ls|sc|
pc|CJ|nt|This trick produced some good news and some bad news for Brenda. |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


pc|C8|at|The bad news was that, however tempted Reese may have been to cover with the @CK, he was able to resist his temptations. |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


hs|nc|at|The good news was that when Brenda called for the @C3 from the dummy, |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


ls|nc|pc|C3|pc|C4|at|the club that Marc played was not the @CK. |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


sk||hs|es|hs|nc|hs|sc|Hs|wc|nt|This is the position that remained. Superficially, Brenda had the rest of the tricks, but the combination of the blockage in the club suit and the fact that Marc still had a trump left, made it impossible for Brenda to win a trick with her long club. |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|ls|es|ls|wc|hs|nd|hs|sd|hs|wd|at|A winning diamond finesse was another option, but Brenda had only 1 hand entry with which to take 2 minor suit finesses. |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


ls|sd|ls|Wd|ls|nd|hs|ss|hs|es|nt|She was able to resolve this dilemna when she drew Marc's last trump. |

hs|sc|hs|nc|hs|wc|at|One of several roads to 12 tricks from here is to win 4 clubs tricks by leading low to dummy's @CQ. |
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|ls|wc|up|3|hs|wd|nt|Stronger defense would be for Reese to discard a diamond on Brenda's last trump. |
