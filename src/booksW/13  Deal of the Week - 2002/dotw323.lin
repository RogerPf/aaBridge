^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 323 - November 18, 2002^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
|cs|4|at|^-{ ^*BSPECIAL!!!! There are 2 Deals of the Week this week!^*N }
^-
Both of these deals were sent to me by e-mail. Actually, I have been receiving a lot of interesting deals by e-mail during the past few weeks. Thanks to all the people who make the effort to send me their favorite deals, but since ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N comes only once a week, I have to be very selective about the deals that I use. So many deals, so little time...

I am pleased to announce the release of ^*BMarty Sez...^*N, our latest educational CD-ROM. This CD is based on the best-selling book of the same name that was written by ^*BMarty Bergen^*N, an award-winning author and 10-time North American Champion. This is the 2nd CD that we have developed that was based on one of Marty's book. Our first joint effort, ^*IPOINTS SCHMOINTS!^*N, was released a couple of months ago and has been selling very well.

Both of these products are filled with practical advice on all aspects of bridge. Most of Marty's writing is intended for "average" players so the level of the material on these CDs is probably too basic for most regular readers of ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N. However, if you have a bridge-playing friend who does not play quite as well as you do, either of these CDs would make for a perfect (and affordable) Christmas gift.

Our company has produced over 20 educational CDs for bridge. Besides Marty, we have worked with several other top authors including, ^*BLarry Cohen^*N, ^*BAudrey Grant^*N, ^*BEddie Kantar^*N, ^*BMike Lawrence^*N, and ^*BKit Woolsey^*N. Regardless of your level of play or the area of the game that you would like to study, we are almost certain to have a CD that will be appropriate for you.

sk|s|nt|This week's first deal was played by ^*BPrahalad Rajkumar^*N (known to his friends as ^*BPrah^*N). Prah, who is only 18 years old, is one of India's brightest young bridge talents. He is currently attending college at the University of Maryland and he played this deal in a local club game. Prah stretched a little to open 2NT as South and his partner raised him to 3NT which became the final contract.|

at|Something strange was going on as neither defender seemed to hold the @S10!|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|Prah realized that one of the defenders was falsecarding. Either East had won the @SJ when he could have won the @S10 or West had played the @SQ on the second round of spades from a holding with included the @S10. The declarer chose to continue with a third round of spades |

nt|This week's second deal was played by our friend ^*BAndy Stark^*N, a Canadian who is now living in Ecuador. This deal was played in a recent tournament in Bolivia known as ^*BThe Bolivarianos^*N. This deal comes from the final of the team event between Ecuador and Colombia. Andy was playing with ^*BAlexander Dietrichson^*N (known as ^*BSasha^*N) when this deal was played.|

hs|wc|nt|The following is not intended to detract from Andy's fine play, but on a double dummy basis, some mistakes were made in the play of this deal. The first mistake came when West split his club honors. If West had made the highly unnatural play of the @C2 on the first round of the suit, subsequent accurate defense would have left Andy without recourse. |
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


nt|Once West reasonably chose to split his club honors, |
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


ls|wc|pc|cj|hs|nc|at|Andy could have come out on top with a highly unnatural play of his own - he had to not play the @CK from the dummy! |

pg| ***** 82 ***** |


hc|h9|at|East had to lead the @H9(!) for the defense to come out on top. |
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sh|nt|The defense has to break hearts on this deal in order to destroy the entries for the squeeze position that Andy was able to reach. The only way that they can safely touch hearts is for East to lead the @H9. |
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|Sh|lc|h9|pc|h9|hs|sh|hs|wh|hs|nh|at|The best Andy can do from this point is to cover the @H9 with his @H10 and win West's @HJ with the @HK. |

pg| ***** 86 ***** |


hs|nc|Hs|sc|Hs|Wc|nt|Suppose that Andy plays a club now to drive out West's remaining honor. |

pg| ***** 88 ***** |


hs|wh|at|West must continue the defensive heart attack in order to defeat the contract. |
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


ls|wh|hs|ws|hs|ns|hs|sc|at|If West errs by returning a spade, Andy could win in the dummy while discarding a club from his hand. |

pg| ***** 95 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|wc|hs|nh|hs|sh|at|were really about the control of the heart suit. |
pg| ***** 96 ***** |


hc|h9|at|The defense must lead hearts twice and their first heart play must be the @H9 from East. The declarer's mission is to try to prevent this. |
pg| ***** 97 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|Sh|lc|h9|hs|wc|hs|nc|hs|ec|at|Whether East or West won the first club trick for the defense turned out to be critical.|
