^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 313 - September 9, 2002^*N
^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
My team (myself and partner ^*BBrad Moss^*N along with ^*BRoy Welland^*N-^*BBjorn Fallenius^*N and ^*BHoward Weinstein^*N-^*BSteve Garner^*N) failed to qualify for the knockout phase of the ^*BRosenblum Cup^*N at the recent World Championships in Montreal. The field of this event consisted of approximately 150 teams that were separated into groups of 10 teams. Each group played a complete round robin of 20 board matches. The top 4 teams in each group qualified for the knockout phase.

The team that I was on got off to a great start. We won 25 Victory Points (the maximum) in both of our first 2 matches. The team was playing in great form and there was no doubt in my mind at this point that we would finish in the top 4. Unfortunately things did not go as expected. We suffered a small loss in the third match before getting killed in each of the next 3 matches.

We were in serious trouble going into the last 3 matches. Not only was our team sitting far from the last qualifying spot, we still had the best 3 teams in our group to play. We responded well with 2 big wins in matches 7 and 8 and it appeared that even a small win in the last match (against a very strong team from Poland) would make us favorites to advance to the knockouts.

When we compared scores in the last match of the round robin, we found that we had lost the match by 3 IMPs, thereby failing to qualify for the knockouts by a single victory point! Of course, any of the players on our team could have made the difference by making better decisions on any of several deals during the course of the round robin. This week's deal was the most painful for me, however, as it came near the end of the final match.

nt||ls|sh|pc|SQ|hs|nh|hs|sh|at|West's opening lead was the @SQ and, although Brad put down a strong hand as dummy (as I had expected), his hand was not very suitable for playing in hearts. |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|hs|nd|at|Still, 2@H was far from hopeless, especially considering that West was marked with the @DK for his 1NT bid and there was a good chance that the @HA was with East. |

nt|Think about how you would continue as declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


at|Hopefully one of the first things that you thought about was the distribution of the defenders' hands. You know that East began with 6 spades and 1 heart based on the play so far. East bid 2@C over Brad's double so he must have at least 4 cards in that suit. |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|If East was dealt 5 clubs (giving him 6115 distribution), he probably would not have sold out to 2@H. It is therefore very likely that East was dealt a 6124 hand. West certainly has the @DK for his 1NT bid. |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


sk||at|In fact, you can be nearly certain that the remaining cards are very similar to what you now see above. |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


hc|dt|nt|The location of one very important card, the @D10, was still uncertain. |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|at|I proceeded to lose a trick to that card, by taking a strange finesse of the @D9 at trick 5. This was not a success! |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |

pg| ***** 21 ***** |


at|I will explain why I made this play shortly, but first let me tell you what happened to me. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


hs|es|nt|After winning the @D10, East cashed the @SJ |

ls|es|pc|sj|pc|s9|pc|c4|pc|c3|

hs|ec|at|and returned the @CK. |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


ls|ec|pc|ck|hs|ec|hs|sc|hs|wh|hs|sh|mc|6|at|I had lost 4 tricks already and there was no way for me to avoid the loss of 3 more tricks (2 trumps and 1 club). I was down 2 in my 2@H contract for -100 -- not a good result. |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


ls|sh|ls|wh|ls|sc|ls|ec|up|9|md|0,dt,,d8|
hs|nd|Hs|sd|hs|wd|nt|Obviously I had been hoping that the @D10 had been dealt to West. Look at how nicely my finesse of the @D9 would have worked if whoever shuffled this hand placed the @D10 where it belonged! |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|ls|wd|
pc|D3|pc|D4|pc|d9|pc|d6|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


hs|nd|at|If my finesse of the @D9 had won, I would have continued by cashing the @DA |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


ls|nd|pc|da|pc|d8|pc|d7|pc|d5|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


hs|wd|hs|nd|hs|ss|hs|sc|at|and then giving West a trick with the @DK as I discarded one of my black suit losers. |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


ls|wd|ls|nd|ls|ss|ls|sc|pc|dq|pc|s7|pc|c5|pc|dk|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


hs|wc|hs|nc|nt|West's best defense would be to refrain from cashing both of his trump winners and to return a club to dummy's @CA instead. |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


ls|Wc|ls|nc|pc|c4|pc|ca|pc|c2|pc|c7|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|ss|hs|wd|at|I could then counter by cashing a diamond for another discard as West would be forced to follow. |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |

pg| ***** 36 ***** |


mc|8|hs|nd|hs|ss|hs|wh|at|My last black suit loser would go on the 5th round of diamonds. West would still score 2 trump tricks, but I would make my contract. |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|ss|ls|wh|up|20|

hs|wd|hs|nd|hs|sd|nt|If the @D10 had been on my left, a more normal finesse against the @DK would still have worked, of course, |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|ls|Wd|pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dq|pc|d6|at|but there would be no way to come to 8 tricks from this point. |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


md|0,d8,,dt|hs|ed|at|If the @D10 had been on my right, however, I would be ok. |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


hs|nd|at|I could continue with the @DA, dropping East's @D10, |

ls|nd|ls|ed|pc|da|pc|dt|pc|d7|pc|d5|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


hs|sc|hs|ss|hs|nd|hs|wd|at|and surrender a trick to West's @DK (discarding a loser) as before. |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


ls|sc|ls|ss|ls|nd|ls|wd|pc|dj|pc|s7|pc|c5|pc|dk|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


up|12|hs|ed|hs|nd|hs|sd|nt|To summarize, if the @D10 was dealt to East, I had to finesse either the @DQ or the @DJ in order to make my contract (playing the @DA on the first round of the suit would also work in this case). |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


md|0,dt,,d8|ls|ed|Hs|Wd|at|If the @D10 was dealt to West, however, I had to take a first round finesse of the @D9. |
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt|The reason that I chose to play West for the @D10 was mathematical in nature. I knew that West had started with 4 diamonds including the @DK. That meant that he had 3 small diamonds, any one of which could have been the @D10. |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


md|0,d8,,dt|ls|wd|hs|ed|at|East, on the other hand, was known to have a doubleton in diamonds so he had only 2 cards that could have been the @D10. |
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


ls|ed|hs|wd|md|0,dt,,d8|nt|The odds were therefore 3 to 2 that the @D10 was on my left and this made my first round finesse of the @D9 the correct percentage play. |
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


md|0,d8,,dt|ls|wd|hs|ed|at|On the actual deal, the percentage play did not work because the @D10 was on my right. My team was thereby eliminated from the 2002 Rosenblum Cup -- if I had made 2@H on this deal we would have qualified for the knockout stage! |
