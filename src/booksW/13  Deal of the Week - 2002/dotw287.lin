nt|Finally, for the first time in almost a week, some people were expecting Team Canada to win a match. Our team (myself and partner ^*BJoey Silver^*N along with ^*BNick Gartaganis^*N-^*BPeter Jones^*N and ^*BKeith Balcombe^*N-^*BGord Campbell^*N) led Poland by 47.5 IMPs at the half way point of the 48-board final of the ^*B2002 IOC Grand Prix^*N.

The match was by no means over, but our team was playing in excellent form. Between the last 24 boards of our semi-final match against Italy and the first 24 boards of the final against Poland, Canada had won 125 IMPs while losing only 22 IMPs!

Nick chose to have Joey and I sit out the 3rd quarter. There were rumblings in the vugraph theatre that this was a mistake. Joey and I were our most experienced pair and we seemed to be hot. Nick, however, had noticed that the other 2 pairs had been hot as well. Nick knew he wanted to play Joey and me in the 4th quarter and he wanted to make sure we were well rested in case the match became close.

How did I feel about this? Well, I would have preferred to have played, but Nick's reasoning did seem logical. It actually didn't matter if I had agreed with Nick's reasoning or not - he was the Captain and his decisions up until then had been double dummy. Nick had the confidence and respect of the other 5 members of our team and none of us would have questioned his decision.

It turned out that Poland outscored Canada 39 IMPs to 9 IMPs in the 12-board 3rd quarter. There was a lot of people in the vugraph theatre saying, "I told you so", but the 30 IMPs we lost had very little to do with who had been playing for Canada. Poland had taken a few aggressive positions, found some fortuitous layouts, and won a few swings. None of that mattered now anyway. What mattered was that there were 12 boards left and Canada still led by 17.5 IMPs.

In the fourth quarter Joey and I were back on vugraph where we would faced ^*BMichal Kwiecien^*N-^*BJacek Pszczola^*N, the reigning World Open Pairs champions. Keith and Gord sat down to play against ^*BCesary Balicki^*N-^*BAdam Zmudzinski^*N in the closed room.

This is about as good as it gets in tournament bridge - playing the last segment of a close match against a great pair in the final of a major tournament. I had been here before, but a number of factors made this opportunity especially exciting: we were serious underdogs, the press was everywhere, we were on vugraph, and it was my birthday! While we were waiting to receive the first board to play, I reflected on similar moments in my bridge career.

In the World Junior Teams Championships in 1991, I was part of the Canadian Team that had unexpectedly reached the finals. My partner, ^*BGeoff Hampson^*N, and I had played the last segment of a very close match on vugraph. We played well, but our team lost the match. At the time I don't think I appreciated the gravity of the situation. I recalled that my thoughts had been along the lines of "what a great experience this will be regardless of the outcome of the match". Loser!

In the Bermuda Bowl in 1995, I was part of the Canadian Team that had unexpectedly reached the finals. My partner, ^*BGeorge Mittelman^*N, and I sat on the bench during the last segment of a close match. Our Captain, ^*BIrving Litvack^*N, had wanted to play George and me, but I was terrified and told Irving that I was too tired to play (an excuse). The rest of our team played just fine, but our American opponents (especially ^*BJeff Meckstroth^*N and ^*BEric Rodwell^*N) played better and Canada lost the match. I am sure that our team would have lost even if I had been playing, but I hated myself for a couple of years after that for being too afraid to play down the stretch. I swore to myself that it would not happen again.

pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|
My current regular partner, ^*BBrad Moss^*N, and I had been in this type of position several times during this past few years. We lost in the finals of both the 2000 World Transnational Teams and the 2001 Spingold. In both of these events our team had not been expected to get that far and in both cases our team lost at the end.

The good news was that I had managed to get over my fear of playing in pressure situations and played the last segments of both of these events. I could have won the Transnational Teams (against a very strong team that included Adam and Cesary) on the third last board if I had bid a slam. There was no way that our team could have won the Spingold regardless of what I did. Our opponents (^*BRose Meltzer^*N's reigning Bermuda Bowl champions) just played too well that day.

Brad and I have also had a series of near misses in major pairs events, notably the 1999 Life Master Pairs (we finished 2nd) and several Cavendish Invitational Pairs (where we always seem to come close, but so far there have been no cigars). Brad and I finally won a big event in 2001 when we were part of the team that won the Reisinger. I felt absolutely no pressure when we played the last session of that event, but I suspect that was due to the fact that I had no idea that our team was in contention for the win.

When the first board of the last quarter of the 2002 IOC Grand Prix was placed on the table, I felt that I was ready. I felt the pressure, but I was not nervous. I was ready to play. I knew that my partner would be ready too. Joey is a born competitor and he had also been here many times before. Keith and Gord were new at this, but as far as I could tell, none of my "inexperienced" teammates had let the pressure get to them yet. I expected them to do fine, but there was no point in thinking about it - whatever happened at the other table was out of my control.

hs|ed|nt|There was some cause for concern on the first board of the fourth quarter. Jacek played in a vulnerable 4@H and Joey made the normal but unsuccessful lead of a diamond away from his @DK (he led the @D2 as we play 3rd and 5th best leads against suit contracts). |

nt|I knew that Keith and Gord would get to 4@H (or 4@S) on this deal, but unless they also received a diamond lead away from the @DK, it was not clear that they would win 10 tricks. The percentage play in hearts is to finesse twice, but playing the @HA on the first round is not much worse. I could only hope that our declarer would not think of a reason to reject the double heart finesse.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt|As expected, Keith and Gord did get to 4@H, but since they play a weak notrump system, South was the declarer. As such, it was impossible for them to get a gift on the opening lead, but Gord made the correct (and winning) decision in hearts to push the board at +620. Canada's lead stayed at 17.5 IMPs with 11 boards still to play.|

Even without the friendly diamond lead, declarer can always guess that suit to win 9 tricks. Not surprisingly, this board was another push at +140. Canada's lead of 17.5 IMPs was intact.|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


hs|nd|nt|I mentioned in the last edition of this series that European experts tend to lead more passively than North Americans. Here is another example. I would have led a heart from Jacek's hand (instead of a diamond). While we are on the subject, note Jacek's choice of diamonds - the @D5. The Poles lead middle from 3 cards and small from worthless doubletons.|

hs|wh|nt|I was hoping for 10 more boards just like the last one. Boring deals are very welcome when you are clinging to a lead. There was not much scope for action in the next deal.

ls|nc|ls|sd|ls|ws|up|23|hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|This felt like another "nothing board". 4@S was certainly a normal contract and, while it was possible to think of a play sequence that would result in 9 tricks for the declarer, it seemed highly unlikely that 4@S would fail in practice. At the other table Keith and Gord also played in 4@S and took 10 tricks for +620. Canada lost an IMP, but still led by 16.5 IMPs with 9 boards to go.|

nt|The next board also felt flat, but there was some chance that we would win a medium-size swing. Jacek and Michal stopped in 3@S and did not really have the values to play in game. 4@S was not a great contract or anything, but at least 10 tricks were certain on the actual layout. |

nt|I am not sure exactly what Jacek and Michal's bids meant, but I assume that 3@S was not invitational (or else Jacek surely would have bid 4@S). With my regular partners this would be an invitational sequence and I would, of course, accept with Jacek's hand. I believe that this treatment is common among North American experts.|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|There are other North American experts, however, who would not open the North hand with a weak 2@S. These people play a style in which a weak 2 bid at favorable vulnerability is primarily a destructive device. In this style, the actual hand that Jacek held would be ^*Itoo good^*N for a weak 2 bid given the vulnerability. They would either pass or open 1@S with Jacek's hand.|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|I don't think anyone "knows" what style is best here. In the style that I normally play, I would open 2@S, but if my spades were @SKQ109xx, I might open 1@S. Play whatever style you want, but just make sure your partner knows it. In Keith and Gord's partnership, Keith could not open 2@S (too strong) or 1@S (too weak). He therefore passed (this feels like the 3 bears).|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|The Polish East at the other table opened 1@H and it was now pretty much impossible for Keith and Gord to get to 4@S. 4@S is not a favorite to succeed, but on this layout 4@S has the all-important virtue of being cold. Keith and Gord were held to +170 when Poland took all of their tricks on defense. Canada lost another IMP to lead by 15.5 with 8 deals to go.|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |

mb|?|
nt|On the next board nobody was vulnerable. Jacek, on my left, opened 1@S and Joey overcalled 2@D. If you have been following this series, you will already know that Joey makes very sound overcalls. Michal passed and it was my turn. What call would you make?|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^3d|
hs|wd|mb|3D|

nt|I bid 3@D, but in retrospect I think I should have passed. I had so few high card points that I knew Joey had a big hand, but I did not like the look of my hand for playing either 3NT or 5@D. I should have known that if I raised to 3@D, then Joey would be likely to bid again and that we would get a minus score.|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


mb|P|mb|3S|mb|P|mb|?|
ls|wd|nt|And of course, what I should have expected to come next did, indeed, come next. Jacek passed and Joey cuebid 3@S. At this point I was thinking, "I will consider it a victory if we do not get doubled wherever we end up". The fact that what I should have expected to come next made me feel this way illustrates the poorness of my 3@D call. |
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt|Notice the thinking process that I am using in evaluating 3@D versus pass. It is not about "how many points you need for 3@D" or "how many points my hand is worth". It is about "what rates to happen next if I pass" and "what rates to happen next if I bid 3@D".|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^4D|
mb|4d|hs|wd|nt|Although Joey's 3@S did not explicitly ask for a spade stopper, my normal action would be to bid 3NT if I had one. I sort of had a spade stopper, but I did not think that it was likely that Joey had 9 tricks in his own hand. If my hand was all that he needed to make 3NT, then he would have bid his hand differently. I therefore retreated to 4@D and hoped for the best.|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|
hs|ed|sk||nt|The good news is that nobody doubled. Joey had a lot of points, as expected, but we couldn't make anything, as expected. He went down 2 in 4@D for -100 (he might have been able to get out for down 1 and -50). This was our first clear minus position of the set. It felt like we should have been able to find a way to go plus on this deal. -100 was no disaster, but it was not a good score.|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


ls|ed|ls|wd|hs|nh|hs|sh|nt|Adam and Cesary did get a nice plus for Poland when they held our cards. The auction started the same way, but Cesary smartly passed where I had bid 3@D. Keith, with a tough balancing problem with Jacek's cards, chose to double. Gord eventually played in 3@H and went down 4, -200 and 7 IMPs to Poland. Canada's lead was down to 8.5 IMPs with 7 boards to go...|

hs|es|hs|ws|ls|nh|ls|sh|nt|The next board was exactly the type of deal we wanted. 4@S is easy to bid and easy to make. We bid it and we made it and so would Adam and Cesary. My hand was unsuitable for an immediate 4@C splinter because of the disparity between my hearts and diamonds. My delayed 4@C showed, not only a singleton club and spade support, but my trick source in diamonds as well.|

pg| ***** 77 ***** |


nt|Joey and I play upside down attitude and count signals, but we have no firm rules about when to give attitude and when to give count. Unfortunately, my count and attitude did not match. If I wanted to give a count signal, I would follow with my @S6 (low-high to show an even number). If I wanted to give an attitude signal, I would play my @S8 (discouraging to deny the @SJ).|
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


nt|Our basic signaling philosophy is to tell partner what we think he needs to know, but it was not clear what Joey needed to know here. If he had the @SAxxx, he might need to know my spade count, but if he had the @SKxxx he would need to know my spade attitude (that is, whether or not I had been dealt the @SJ). |
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


nt|Joey and I have a few simple rules on defense. One of these is that we do not think for a long time before signaling (as doing so often gives partner an ethical problem).

hs|wh|hs|wc|sk|w|nt|The third last deal was exciting. Only our side was vulnerable and Joey opened 1@C as dealer. Michal overcalled 1@D and I bid 2@H, a ^*Bfit-showing jump^*N according to our partnership. That is, a forcing bid that shows at least 5 hearts, at least 4 clubs, and at least invitational values. Those of you who have been following this series will have seen the fit-showing jump before.|
pg| ***** 119 ***** |


nt|As I have said, I do not normally play fit-showing jumps and I do not really claim to understand them. Joey loves fit-jumps and that's good enough for me. I think I learned something about fit-showing jumps, however, in the course of this tournament: it is best if they are either made on limit raise hands or on very strong hand. Do not make them on in-between hands.|
pg| ***** 120 ***** |


nt|In other words, when you make a fit-showing jump, you should either be willing to relinquish control of the auction immediately or be willing to take control of the auction at a later point in the bidding. Joey and I have never discussed this principle, but I suspect that he would agree with me. Still, I don't claim to know much about fit jumps - I don't know if my 2@H was a "good bid" or not. |

bt||nt|
What happened next was that a whole bunch of Canadians became very excited! It was not just members of our team. Most of their wives, the members of the Canadian Women's Team, Canadian Bridge Federation President ^*BRay Lee^*N (who had been instrumental in putting our team together), and various other Canadian supporters (including my friends ^*BGeorge Mittelman^*N and ^*BEric Kokish^*N) also got into the act. Canada had never won a Gold Medal in a team event of this stature before. This was a great moment for Canadian bridge!

My only previous win in a major event had come a few months earlier in the Reisinger. This win felt much better. For one thing, it was not completely surprising that the team I had played on in the Reisinger had won the event. What happened in Salt Lake City was completely surprising.  In addition, a controversial appeal decided the Reisinger and left some very bad feelings in the air. There was nothing except good feelings in the air right then in Salt Lake City!

Our Captain and leader, Nick Gartaganis, had done a magnificent job steering the ship. His task was made easier because all of our members had played their best bridge, all of us had behaved like gentlemen, and there had been no acrimony between partners or teammates. Still, being Captain is never easy or fun and Nick had a lot of difficult decisions to make. The fact that he was able to both make effective decisions while playing as well as he did speaks volumes for Nick's bridge ability and character. Thanks to Nick, Peter, Keith, and Gord for helping to make the 2002 IOC Grand Prix one for the highlight reels!

And a special thanks to Joey Silver, my dear partner and dear friend. Joey was the one who really taught me to play this game. This win would not have meant quite as much if I had been playing with anyone else.|
pg| ***** 184 ***** |


nt|
Here are 2 important things that I learned from this experience. I had suspected that these things were true, but it was nice to get confirmation:

1. There are a lot of bridge players out there who, on any given deal, are capable of playing as well as any world class player. What separates the world class players from the masses is consistency. All of the players on my team were experts, but before the IOC Grand Prix, most of us would not be considered "world class". However, those players rose to the occasion. They played as well as they possibly could. It turned out that this was good enough to beat Italy and Poland. 

This win should be an inspiration to all aspiring bridge champions: it is possible to beat the best. All you have to do is not make very many mistakes and hope that you make more good decisions than the opponents. This is ^*Bmuch^*N easy said than done, of course, but you should take some comfort in knowing that it is possible!
|
pg| ***** 185 ***** |


nt|

2. That it is possible to win playing a natural system with very few agreements. Joey and I played ^*Bvery^*N few conventions and we had spent no more than half an hour discussing our system. As far as I can remember we did not have a single bidding misunderstanding. We had a lot of big hands to bid and I felt that overall we had done well.

In theory the IOC Grand Prix was a tournament where only simple systems were allowed, but in practice this meant that some of the partnerships could not play their preferred 2-level opening bids. The Poles still played their Polish 1@Cs. Their was an Australian pair playing the Symetric Relay. There were several Precision pairs, including Berkowitz and Cohen from the United States, playing a very sophisticated version. 

System is not what bridge is all about. Joey introduced me to this radical idea almost 10 years ago and now I know it is true. Winning is about making fewer errors and better guesses than the opponents. For me playing a natural system is very liberating and this allows me to focus on the other (more important) aspects of the game. Try it some time. It is a fun way to play and it works!|
