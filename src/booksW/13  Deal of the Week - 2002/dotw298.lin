^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 298 - May 27, 2002^*N
^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played by me (^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N) during the recent ^*BCavendish Invitational Pairs^*N. The deal has been rotated to make South the declarer. I was playing with my regular partner, ^*BBrad Moss^*N, when this week's deal was played. Most ^*BDeals of the Week^*N focus on card play, but I get a lot of e-mail requests to write more about bidding. The card play of this week's deal is interesting, but most of the writeup concerns bidding. If there are specific topics that you would like me to cover in future ^*BDeals of the Week^*N, please e-mail:

^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N is proud to announce the release of our latest educational software product:

|cs|2|at|^-{ ^*BThe Two Over One System^*N
 ^*Bby Mike Lawrence^*N }
^-
In this product, 3-time World Champion ^*BMike Lawrence^*N presents the Two Over One Game Force (or 2/1) bidding system to the reader. 2/1 is the system of choice for most North American experts and, in the last few years, this bidding system has been catching on throughout the world at a rapid pace. ^*BMike Lawrence^*N has already written several books on this subject and he has played 2/1 himself for almost 30 years. He really knows what he is talking about!

I have played 2/1 Game Force with all of my regular partners since the late 1980s and, in my view, this system provides an excellent balance between natural bidding and science.

Mike's writing style and unique sense of humor have made him one of the most popular and successful bridge authors in history. ^*BThe Two Over One System^*N is the 6th software product that Mike has produced in cooperation with ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N The graphics, interactivity, and volume of material that these products contain combine to make them more effective in terms of learning (and more fun) than reading a book.

^*BThe Two Over One System^*N contains hundreds of interactive quizzes and example hands. Mike also goes to great lengths to point out the weaknesses in 2/1 Game Force and suggests alternatives for getting around these problems. Whether you already play 2/1 or want to learn to play the system, this is a great product for you!

nt|In this week's deal nobody was vulnerable and Fred, South, opened 1@D in 3rd position. Fred and Brad were facing 2 great players in a new partnership when this week's deal was played. ^*BGeir Helgemo^*N of Norway was West and ^*BEddie Wold^*N of the USA sat East. Geir and Eddie finished in 8th place (of 60 pairs) in the 2002 Cavendish Pairs while Fred and Brad finished 15th.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


mb|P|mb|2H|an|Reverse Flannery Response|
ls|sd|nt|After Geir passed as West, Brad jumped to 2@H. Fred and Brad use the 2 cheapest jump shifts after a minor suit opening (1@C - 2@D or 2@H and 1@D - 2@H or 2@S) as conventional bids known as ^*BReverse Flannery Responses^*N. The fact that Brad was a passed hand did not come into play here. Fred and Brad use this convention irrespective of passed hand status.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|Before I go into detail about why this is a useful convention and how it works, it is important to mention that only serious partnerships should consider adopting ^*BReverse Flannery Responses^*N. As with any convention, unless you are prepared to thoroughly discuss the followups with your regular partner, you would be better off without it!|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|^*BBridge Base Online^*N contains a ^*BPartnership Bidding Area^*N that is ideally suited for practicing various conventions with a partner. By using this facility you can constrain the hands that will be generated for practicing bidding with your partner. This is an extremely effective and fun way to work on your partnership (and, like all aspects of ^*BBridge Base Online^*N, it is ^*B100% free^*N). |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|^*BWarning^*N: I am about to launch into some serious bidding theory. If you are not interested in this sort of thing, think that ^*BReverse Flannery^*N is a stupid convention, or find this convention too complex, then click the  ^$40  button on the toolbar below several times until I continue my discussion of what actually happened on this week's deal|

|cs|2|at|^-{ In the auctions above, South's 2@H and 2@S bids are ^*BReverse Flannery Responses^*N }
^-
There is no "standard" way to play the ^*BReverse Flannery Responses^*N convention or the followups to this convention. What you will read here is the way that I use this convention in my regular partnerships. Something else you should know is that, if you adopt this convention, you should do so over both 1@C and 1@D opening bids. 

|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|All of my examples will be based on 1@D openings. In some cases the response structure is slightly different when the opening bid is 1@C (I will mention these cases at the appropriate times). When 1@C is the opening bid, 2@D and 2@H are the ^*BReverse Flannery Responses^*N.

|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ The ^*Icheaper^*N ^*BReverse Flannery Response^*N (1@C - 2@D or 1@D - 2@H) 
 shows a hand with 5 or more spades, 4 or more hearts, and 5-9 HCP. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ The ^*Imore expensive^*N ^*BReverse Flannery Response^*N (1@C - 2@H or 1@D - 2@S) 
 shows a hand with exactly 5 spades, exactly 4 hearts, and 10 to a bad 12 HCP. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


at|A good question at this point would be: what is the benefit of being able to show these sorts of hand types in one bid?

|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt|
In fact, there are several benefits to playing ^*BReverse Flannery Responses^*N:

1. Suppose that you are not playing this convention. Responder (with 5 or more spades and 4 or more hearts) with respond 1@S to his partner's minor suit opening. Now suppose that opener rebids his minor as in the following auction:

|cs|1|at|^-{ |ia| 1dp1sp2dp?|at| }
^-
It is still very possible that the opener has a 4-card heart suit, but if responder also hold 4 hearts, it is too dangerous for him to bid that suit now unless he has substantial extra values (as 2@H is forcing and some partnerships even play that it is forcing to game). As such, a 4-4 heart fit easily could be lost.

This is not a problem playing ^*BReverse Flannery Responses^*N as a responder, with spades and hearts, will be able to show both of his suits on the first round of bidding.

|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


at|2. When the auction goes as above (and in several other auctions) and the responder does rebid 2@H, a smoother auction often results when ^*BReverse Flannery Responses^*N are being used. In the above auction, for example, ^*BReverse Flannery^*N makes it safe to play that responder's 2@H rebid is forcing to game. Without ^*BReverse Flannery^*N, this treatment also has advantages, but there are some serious drawbacks as well.

|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt|
Some more advantages to playing ^*BReverse Flannery Responses^*N :

3. Suppose the auction goes as follows:

|cs|1|at|^-{ |ia| 1dp!2hp4s|at| }
^-
2@H is a ^*BReverse Flannery Response^*N (showing in this case at least 5 spades, at least 4 hearts, and 5-9 HCP). Opener is going to want to bid 4@S (a signoff), for example, on a significant percentage of hands. Some of these hands will be balanced and some will be unbalanced (with shortness in either of the other 2 suits). Sometimes opener will have extra high card values and sometimes he will have no more than a good-fitting minimum.

Responder won't have any idea what opener's hand looks like, but it will not matter to him (since he is about to be the dummy). The opponents, however, may well find it difficult to make an effective opening lead and/or defend accurately given that they will know very little about the declarer's high card strength and distribution.

|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


at|4. This convention seems to work. Regular readers of ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N know that I do not endorse very many conventions, but my results on deals in which ^*BReverse Flannery Responses^*N have played a factor have been consistently good over several years.

|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|Here is the response structure that I use over a ^*BReverse Flannery Response^*N:

|cs|1|at|^b{|ia| 1dp!2hp?|at|} ^m{|ia| 1dp!2sp?|at|}

- In either of the auctions above, opener passes if he wants to sign off in the suit that responder bid and bids the other major at the cheapest level in order to sign off in that suit.

|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


at|- Opener can rebid 3@H or 3@S in the first auction and 3@S in the second auction in order to invite game in that suit. Note that opener has no way to invite game in hearts in the second auction).

|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


at|- If opener's rebid is a game contract, he is making a complete signoff. Responder must pass regardless of his high card strength and distribution. As you will see, opener has a way to find out about whether responder has a minimum or a maximum for the bidding or if he has extra shape.

|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


at|- Opener's 2NT rebid is artificial and it shows either a signoff in a minor or a slam try in a major. When the opening bid in 1@D and opener has the "signoff in a minor" hand type, he could either have long diamonds or have a 5+-5+ in the minors. Followup auctions will be described shortly.

|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


at|- Opener's 3@C rebid asks responder for more information about his hand. This bid can be used to invite game or to investigate which game is best. Followup auctions will be described shortly.

|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


at|- Opener's 3@D rebid shows a game force with 6+ cards in the suit that was opened. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|
When the auction goes as follows:

|cs|1|at|^b{|ia| 1dp!2hp!2np?|at|} ^m{|ia| 1dp!2sp!2np|at|}

Opener's 2NT rebid is either a slam try in a major or a signoff in a minor. If the opening bid is 1@C, then responder must bid 3@C and opener will either pass or bid 3 of a major as a slam try in that suit. Responder can then cuebid if he likes his hand for slam.

|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


at|If the opening bid is 1@D, then responder would normally bid 3@D over 2NT. He would bid 3@C only if he had longer clubs than diamonds (in case opener has a minimum hand with 5+-5+ in the minors). In either case opener can now bid 3 of a major as a slam try, pass 3@C or 3@D, or correct 3@C to 3@D in order to signoff in 3@D. |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|
When the auction goes as follows:

|cs|1|at|^b{|ia| 1dp!2hp!3cp?|at|} ^m{|ia| 1dp!2sp!3c?|at|}

Opener's 3@C rebid asks responder to further describe his hand. In either of the above auctions, responder can bid 3@D over 3@C to show a minimum hand for the initial response.

|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


at|In the first auction, responder can have either 6 spades or 5 hearts. He can bid 3 of a major over 3@C to show extra length in that suit and 3NT over 3@C to show maximum high card values in a hand with no extra distribution.

|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


at|In the second auction, responder has shown his exact major suit distribution already (exactly 5 spades and exactly 4 hearts). 3 of a major over 3@C now shows a maximum with a singleton in the corresponding minor (3@H shows short clubs and 3@S shows short diamonds). 3NT over 3@C shows a maximum hand with 5422 distribution.

|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


at|I am not claiming that this is the best or most effective response structure over ^*BReverse Flannery^*N (in fact I am sure that it is not as some sequences are not defined). In my experience, however, these followups have always managed to get the job done and I have found them relatively easy to remember.

nt|Back to this week's deal. Brad's 2@H bid was a ^*BReverse Flannery Response^*N, in this case showing a minimum response (roughly 5-9 HCP) with 5 or more spades and 4 or more hearts. That is not the call that I was hoping to hear with my particular hand, but I had a solution available. If you have been reading carefully you will know what it is!|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^2n|mb|2N|an|Signoff in a minor or slam try in a major|
nt|I bid 2NT (either a slam try in a major or a signoff in a minor). Obviously I had the "signoff in a minor" variety. It may have been a little bit pessimistic of me to give up on game with my hand. Still, Brad's known major suit length had made my hand worse and, given that we were not vulnerable, I thought that trying to get out in 3@D was the percentage action.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |

ls|sd|
pc|DQ|pc|D8|pc|S2|pc|H3|at|(which had been dealt to Geir) as Eddie discarded a heart on this trick. |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|The contract was safe as there was no way that I could lose more than 1 trick in each suit. The Cavendish Pairs is scored using IMPs so overtricks are not critically important, but they are definitely not to be sneezed at (especially given the strength of the field in this event). Do you see any chance of making an overtrick in 3@D?|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sh|nt|In fact, there is almost no legitimate technical chance to make an overtrick on this deal, especially against such strong defenders. I considered ducking a heart trick in an attempt to improve my squeeze chances. |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


ls|sd|ls|nh|ls|sh|hs|sd|at|I also considered running all of my trumps immediately. I just didn't think that either of these plays would work. |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


ls|sd|nt|I was able to think of a non-technical chance (that is, a swindle) that I thought was much more likely to work than any legitimate play. Can you think of what I did? |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


ls|sd|hs|nc|hs|sc|sk||hs|wc|at|I tried the effect of a low club toward dummy's @C10, hoping that Geir had been dealt the @CJ and that it would not be clear to him to win the trick with that card! |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt||ls|sc|ls|wc|ls|nc|
pc|C4|hs|wc|at|Geir gave my @C4 some serious thought, but he eventually made the very reasonable play of ducking his @CJ! |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


ls|wc|pc|C3|
at|If you think I am writing about this deal in order to show off for having tricked the great Helgemo, you have it all wrong. In fact, I probably would not have tried this swindle against most players, but Geir was certainly good enough to duck his @CJ if it looked like the right play. |
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


hs|nc|nt|So it was my profound respect for my left hand opponent that made me adopt this unusual line of play, but the same factor made it all the more satisfying when the @C10 won the trick! |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |

hs|ns|hs|ss|hs|es|at|I tried to sneak a spade through next, but Eddie (who had a much easier problem then Geir had on the trick before) went up with his @SA. |

ls|ns|ls|ss|ls|es|
pc|S3|pc|SA|pc|SK|pc|S6|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sh|nt|There was no way that I was going to avoid a heart loser against these guys so I claimed my contract with an overtrick for +130. The real purpose of this ^*BDeal of the Week^*N was to introduce the ^*BReverse Flannery Responses^*N convention, but I hope you enjoyed reading about the play of this deal as well! |mc|10|
