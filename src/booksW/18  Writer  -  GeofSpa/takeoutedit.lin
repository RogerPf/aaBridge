ht|g|at| @2While I was watching last weeks Fun Friday 12 Tournament I saw some atrocious doubles in the direct seat.  While I sympathise with you not wanting to pass an opening hand you will be misleading your partner if you double every time your RHO opens and you hold 12 - 14 HCP.|

The following pages suggest the hand shape and quality required to make a takeout double in the direct seat, how to respond (advance) to a takeout double and then finally how the overcaller (doubler) can continue the bidding.

To access the guidelines I am suggesting you will need to use the page forward ( ^$40 ) button once you have finished reading the current section|

at|I'm going to try and deal with the commonest convention in play today, the take out double. I'll start with when to make a double for take out at the one level, how to respond and how to advance. Firstly a shock to the system perhaps. Here are four hands. It's love all and right hand opponent bids 1@h. What do you do with each of these hands?

Okay, so it's an article about take out doubles. The answer is that you should make a take out double with ^*bnone^*n of these hands. ^*bHands 1-3^*n all have a clear pass of 1@h, while ^*bhand 4^*n has a very respectable 2@c bid.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |

Why start with four hands which are not take out doubles then? |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|

Simple - when played at the table hands like these all doubled 1@h for take out. If you thought double was right with any of these read on. |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt| @2
Classically the take out double is used to show one of three hand types. These are:|

{ ^*BTYPE 3) A balanced hand which is too strong to make a 1NT overcall (more than 17points).^*n}|

A quick word about what to do if third hand bids something rather than passing. After a redouble, for example, you are released from bidding but should try to help partner by bidding a 5 card suit when you have one. If RHO bids a suit, then you can bid in the same way as before, but you need some values to enter the auction. |

It's right to make a take out double when you hold one of three hand types; shortage with good support, strong balanced, and strong unbalanced. Following a takeout double you need to show which type of hand we have. |
