^-{ ^*bTake Out Doubles 1: When should you use them?^*n }
^-
|
pg| ***** 0 ***** |


at|I'm going to try and deal with the commonest convention in play today, the take out double. I'll start with when to make a double for take out at the one level, how to respond and how to advance. Firstly a shock to the system perhaps. Here are four hands. It's love all and right hand opponent bids 1@h. What do you do with each of these hands?

Okay, so it's an article about take out doubles. The answer is that you should make a take out double with ^*bnone^*n of these hands. ^*bHands 1-3^*n all have a clear pass of 1@h, while ^*bhand 4^*n has a very respectable 2@c bid.|

Why start with four hands which are not take out doubles then? |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|

Simple - when played at the table hands like these all doubled 1@h for take out. If you thought double was right with any of these read on. |

Classically the take out double is used to show one of three hand types. These are:|

{ ^*bTYPE 1) A shapely hand of around opening strength upwards which can play in one of three suits, while short in the suit doubled.^*n }
|

{ ^*bTYPE 2) A strong hand which is too good for a direct overcall - somewhere around 8 playing tricks.^*n }|

cs|2|
at|

{ ^*BTYPE 3) A balanced hand which is too strong to make a 1NT overcall (more than 17points).^*n}|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |

For example, each of these hands qualifies for a take out double of 1@h:

In essence a take out double followed by a new suit or NT shows a hand which is too good to bid the suit or NT directly.|

After double of 1@h, suppose partner had bid 2@c  |

^*bHand 7^*n should rebid 2NT (double and then NT = too good to overcall 1NT) showing a balanced hand of around 18-20 points. Double and then NT does not show a shortage in the suit partner bids. ^*bTYPE 3^*n|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |

The take out double is a valuable weapon when you know clearly what kind of hand partner will double on. Respond assuming that partner has support for your suit and around 14 points. More on how to respond later, but notice how you are thinking of your rebid before making the initial double. |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |

Take my advice and limit this take out double at the one level to show only these three hand types. Having an opening hand is not reason enough to double for take out. Shape is as important as points. |

A very sound rule is not to make a take out double when your hand is a weak no trump. (12-14 or weaker and balanced).|

^*bHand 9^*n has no support for diamonds and must not double despite the 12 points. Bid a constructive 1@s and be proud of the spade suit.|

^*bHand 10^*n has 17 points but still does not qualify for a take out double. Bidding 1NT announces 15-17 points and a balanced hand. If you can tell all this to partner in one bid why not make it! |

sb|sthis bid depends on our agreements|
lb|*bRHO opens 1H at love all what do you bid?^^2s^|at|
a) Bid 2@S (11-15 with 6 spades) ^*U(if you have that available)^*n or 1@S if you play a jump overcall as something else. There are not 8 playing tricks in this hand. Doubling and then bidding spades would suggest more.|

h) Double is best here. Bidding 1@s could work well, but the suit is poor. This time you have only 10 points, but great shape. This is going to play well in any suit other than hearts. About the minimum for a take out double.
