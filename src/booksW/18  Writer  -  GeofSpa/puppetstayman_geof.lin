3NT    I am not interested in 4 card majors
           this is "to play". 

In this case, Partner was testing to see if Opener had a 5 card major and would have played in a 5-3 fit.|

Responder with a 5 card major will show it via a transfer sequence.

3@d/@h ..........asking for transfer to @h/@s|

Responder with 5 Spades and 4 Hearts

Bids 3@s over 2NT.  This specifically shows a holding of 5 Spades and 4 Hearts|

Responder with 5 Spades and 5 hearts

bids 3@h over 2NT, and then bids 4@h over the forced 3@s|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |

Responder with 5 Hearts and 4 Spades

bids 3@d asking for transfer to 3@h, and then bids 3@s over the forced 3@h response.|

These last 2 sequences shows the difference with holdings of 5/4 and 5/5 in the majors, and avoids the danger of playing 4@h on a 4/2 fit|
