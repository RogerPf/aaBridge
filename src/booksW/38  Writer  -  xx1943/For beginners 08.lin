sb|sI like the lead. :)|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|Yes. It could have been a tougher one, like a club lead. What is your plan?
|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


sb|sI count 7 sure tricks.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


at|True. 2@s, 3@h, 2@c = 7 sure tricks. You need 9 for your bid. Where will you find the 2 missing tricks?
|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


sb|sI have a choice between the spade or diamond suits.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


sb|sThe diamond seems best as it requires only to force out the Ace and King.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|Correct again. To set-up the spades for 2 tricks you would need it to be distributed 3-3 and this is only a 36% probability. So, diamond is a better choice.
Now, last but not least... Do you take the lead in dummy or in your hand?|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


sb|sThis is an easy one. In dummy of course, to unblock the suit.|

pg| ***** 17 ***** |


sb|S|
at|You needed to plan entries to dummy. Good defenders will always hold-up once before cashing their diamonds honours. Therefore, you needed 2 entries to dummy: one to force out the 2nd honour (Ace or King) and the second to reach the dummy once the @d suit is established.

pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|Correct! Now, let me ask you again... Should you take the J@h lead in dummy?
|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


sb|sI see now. I needed to preserve my entry to dummy.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


at|Correct! It is usually right to unblock with Kx or Ax except when you are in need of an entry. Then, you play against the "stomach". First, you do not expect a problem from blocking the heart suit. Second, the only way you can make your bid is by preserving the dummy entry. Wait a moment while I go back to the first trick...|sb|s|

pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt|Count your tricks: 2@S+1@H+3@D=6. 3 more will come from @cs. 
But there is a problem: Opponents may get 4@h-tricks along with the @c A. 
Do you hold-up or not? Once, twice??|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


sb|s'Rule of 7' tells me to hold-up once with 6 cards (7 - 6 = 1).|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|Very good! By holding-up once you will break the communication between the opps when the distribution of missing @Hs is 5-2. If the distribution is 4-3, then your bid is safe anyway since you may lose only 3@hs and 1@c. 
So, hold-up the heart once and hope @cA is with East, if West has 5@hs.|

But you realize the @ds could be split 4-1. Would you not like to know how to ensure you make your bid against any distribution and increase the potential for over-tricks?|

sb|sOf course. What is the best way to play the suit?|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|We will discuss it but first tell me how you plan to handle the lead.|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


sb|s'Rule of 7': hold-up twice with 5 cards (7 - 5 = 2).|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


at|
Actually, you could hold-up and it could work out well. But with KQx, the best play is to take the lead and plan the play of the diamonds in such a way that you avoid the dangerous opponent (East). Why is East a danger?
|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


do|e|sb|sBecause if East gets the lead he will play a heart through my tenace.|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


at|Right you are! How can we prevent it? By making the @d finesse in such a way that if it loses, we do not lose it to East, the dangerous hand.|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


sb|sI got it. I need to finesse through East.|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


nt|So that it may only lose to West, if it loses.... Ok. Now you execute the plan.|

pg| ***** 72 ***** |


sb|sI have 5 sure tricks and I have to play both spades and hearts to get 4 more.|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


nt|Yes. @ss may give you 2 or 3 more and @hs 3 more. So, one suit is not enough. Which suit should you tackle first?|
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


sb|sSpades?|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


at|
Why spades? If West has both a @h and @s entry, the contract is doomed. When West has a single entry, you need to tackle his entry first. Therefore, you need to first play @h, then @s, because in spades only East (the non dangerous opp) will be able to take the lead. 
Now, what do you do with the lead? Hold up or not?|
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


sb|s'Rule of 7' tells me to hold up once (7 - 6 = 1).|
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


nt|It is correct to say that normally you need to hold up. However, here you need to worry about a shift to the club suit. You would then risk to lose 3@cs, 1@h, and 1@d. So, no immediate hold-up. But once you have removed West's entry, you will hold up (a delayed hold up) if opps play a second round of @ds. This way you make sure that if you lose the @s finesse to East, then East is not able to transfer the lead to West.
Does it make sense?|

sb|sIt looks very much like the previous hand.|
pg| ***** 105 ***** |


nt|Yes. It is a similar problem. You are still missing 4 tricks to make your bid and as in hand ##4 you need to make these tricks in both the spades and heart suits. So, which suit should you tackle first this time?|
pg| ***** 106 ***** |


sb|sHearts?|
pg| ***** 107 ***** |


at|
@hs? In your opinion the dangerous opponent is East or West?|
pg| ***** 108 ***** |


sb|sIt is West because he threatens to set-up possibly 3 diamond tricks.|
pg| ***** 109 ***** |


nt|Very good! So West being the dangerous one, we need to tackle his entry first. If West has both the @sK and the @HA, we are down. To make our bid, like it or not, we will need to make a @s finesse. Now, contrary to hand ##4, we are finessing into the dangerous hand, West.|
pg| ***** 110 ***** |


do|w|nt||sb|S|
at|Therefore, in case the finesse should fail, we need to tackle the finesse first while we are still in control of the @d suit. If West holds the @sK, no problem, as long as we are still controlling the @d suit. If the finesse works, no problem, since we can then set-up the hearts while still controlling the @d suit. So, you need to tackle the @s first. 
Have you decided how to handle the lead?

at|
Bad idea. You need 2 more tricks from @hs. No problem if the @hs are 3-2 but what if they are 4-1? If you need 3 tricks never think of playing the Q or J to finesse missing KT98. 
Never lead an honour when a small card would do. The proper method is to lead small towards your QJ combination. If the Q or J wins, you need to repeat the process. To increase your chances, think of playing the @hA first, just in case the missing King is a singleton.|

Well, East should answer this by the card he chooses to play. Let's see!|
pg| ***** 161 ***** |


pc|hhj|
nt|With only 3 small cards in dummy East would have played the Ace if he had it. So a holdup is not possible since this would allow East to continue the suit and lead through your heart tenace. In addition and more important is the fact that you have only 1 stopper in the other suits. By holding-up you risk a club or spade shift which would allow the opps to set-up their own long suit.|

hc|s2sAd6dKc9cQs5sQd7dQ|sc|y|nt|You need to plan the play more carefully. Let's look at all cards played. First, to be able to set-up the long suit in dummy you need to assume a 3-2 distribution. With xx in your hand you can reach dummy only twice and you have only one more entry to dummy, the @HA. Whenever you are short of entries, think of doing a coup en blanc. 
Now wait while I give you a 2nd chance at the play.|

}|ht|r|at|^b@2^z@3Both hands have in common they have 5 tricks from top and so you need to find 4 other tricks.|
pg| ***** 202 ***** |


at|
In both hands the conclusion is you have to find them tricks in in spades and in hearts.|
pg| ***** 203 ***** |


at|
A third common property of both hands is that West is the dangerous hand. |
pg| ***** 204 ***** |


at|
If both diamond guards @dAK are gone West will have 3 tricks in diamonds + 2 for regaining the lead twice makes 5 tricks to West. Down 1 for North/South. |
pg| ***** 205 ***** |

The distribution of cards in both hands is higly the same, but for being reversed, upside-down, for North and South as far as hearts and spades are concerned.|

So if the first finesse has to loose I would like it to loose it to West.|
pg| ***** 210 ***** |

Then I can still hope that the second finesse is going to East. |

So for both hands you play your first finesse into the dangerous hand WEST.|

Conclusion: in hand ##4 and ##5 you take the @dQ with @dK.|

In hand ##4 you start with @hJ and continue from there as long as the @hA does not come down.|

|
cs||cp||fp||ht|e|

at|^b@2Hi Ronald, hands ##4 and ##5 are the toughest, no doubt. This is my own summary for these 2 hands. I hope this helps.

^iBoth contracts 3NT, declarer South, lead @dQ

Hand ##4 ^mFacts: ^wHand ##5|
ht|i|at|{|ih|saqt9hjt2dk54c765,sj32hkq76da32cak4|at|}|
ht|i|at|^w{|ih|sj93hqj32dk4ck843,saqt2hkt4da32ca52|at|}|

ht|h|at|^e@2^y@3

1) The only issue here is which suit to lead first.
|
pg| ***** 218 ***** |


 
at|
2) In both hands West is the dangerous hand because West threatens to set-up @3 his long suit.
|
pg| ***** 219 ***** |


at|
3) The key difference between the 2 hands is that with hand ##4 you can finesse the spade suit into the Safe opponent East while in hand ##5 you cannot.
|
pg| ***** 220 ***** |


at|
4) We are concerned about the placement of two cards, the @SK and @HA. Let's call them the "concern" cards. 
|
pg| ***** 221 ***** |


at|
Principle (taken from book by Berthe and Lebely - Play at NT: When you are forced to set-up 2 suits and you hold 2 stoppers in the suit lead, you need to start by setting-up the suit which the dangerous opponent is most likely to have a winner. You will therefore remove his entry prematurely. 

Therefore based on the above facts, you select which suit to lead first.|
pg| ***** 222 ***** |


ht|h|at|^e@2^z@3@4

This is the easier of the two hands. Our priority is to work on removing relevant entry cards detained by West, the dangerous hand. Since the @SK can be finessed into the Safe opponent, it is clearly not a concern. Therefore the @hA is the "concern" card in hand ##4.
|
pg| ***** 223 ***** |


 
at|
If you were to finesse the @SK first and lose the finesse, you lose your bid when the @HA is with the West. However, playing on hearts first, you can't lose....... When you finesse the @SK later on after regaining the lead, you win 10 tricks if it wins. If it loses, you win 9 tricks. @0@1 |
pg| ***** 224 ***** |


ht|h|at|@4^a@2^z@3|
ht|h|at|^wHand ##5|
ht|i|at|^w{|ih|sj93hqj32dk4ck843,saqt2hkt4da32ca52|at|}|
ht|h|at|^b@2^w@3

Since you cannot afford to lose the spade finesse to the dangerous hand, you play it first. If the finesse wins, then you are OK. If you lose the finesse, then you need to have the @hA with East to make your bid. If West has both the @HA and @SK then you never had a chance anyway. In other words: you wish East to have both the @HA and @SK or West to have either the @HA or @SK.
|
pg| ***** 225 ***** |


at|
Since you have to try the spade finesse to set-up 2 spade tricks you need to play on spades first. If West happens to have the @SK then your only chance is to have the @HA with East. If East happens to have the @SK, you are making your bid, since you will remove the single entry with West (@HA) while still having control of all other suits.
