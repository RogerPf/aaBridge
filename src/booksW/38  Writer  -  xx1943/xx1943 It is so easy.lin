   This story happened in my local club a few days ago. I played with an expert partner. 
   Now please take his seat.

pg| ***** 1 ***** |


pn|You,West,xx1943,East|sb|SDone, thank you!|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


sb|s|nt|This is a nice hand, you count 19 HCP and 8 winners. 
While you are wondering which opening to chose (perhaps 2@c, the hand is soooooo beautiful), RHO opens .....|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


mb|1s|lb|*bWhat is your bid?^^x^|
nt|Your hand is too strong for 2@h or 4@h not to talk about 3@h which would show a weak jump overcall.
2@s is Michaels cuebid (showing a 2-suiter with @h), so there is no other call but double.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


mb|xp1NT|an|(7)8-10 HCP, balanced|mb|p|lb|*bWhat is your call now?^^3h^|
nt|2@h would show a good hand (about 1K or A better a normal double), but this hand is too strong. Your bid is 3@h forcing to game and setting the suit.|mb|3h|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


mb|p4hp|lb|*bWhat now???^^4NT^|
mb|4n|an|RKCB for !H|nt|Despite the danger that partner has his HCP in @s slam must have a chance, if partner holds an Ace.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


mb|p5c|an|1 or 4 keys|at|
Great news. Let assume partner holds a club honor along with this A. All finesses must be right.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


sb|sAnd here we go!!!|mb|p6hppp|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |

pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt|South has 5 losers in his hand. @d2 and 2 are covered by honors in dummy.|hc|d2c2dack|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


lc|d2c2dack|at|
The @s loser is inevitable. It will be lost in a flash. So our goal is to avoid the other 2 minor losers.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|
There is a great chance, that both minor Qs are with East. After all he opened the bidding. |sb|sOk let us try this one.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |

pc|hhhh|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


pc|hdsh|sb|sOne more trump doesn't hurt me and they have to discard once more.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


pc|hcss|sb|sThis were the easy ones. Now we have to start the finessing.|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


lb|*cWhich card do you play now?^^c2^hadkdjd2cacjc2|
sb|s|nt|In @c there is only a one way to finesse. We must hope, that East holds the @cQ, which is with the odds.|
pc|ccckc|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


pc|cccqc|sb|sBINGO!|at||
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


pc|cAccc|sb|s|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt||lb|*cWhich card do you play now?^^dk^hadkdjd2|
sb|sHmhhhh. Isn't this a pure guess, where to look for the DQ??|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


sb|sAnd didn't we say East (the opener) has probably all the HCP?|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


sb|s|nt|Didn't your teacher show you a method how to place cards except playing the "Coup de giraffe" (looking in opponents cards)?|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


sb|sYep. ................. He taught me:   count-count-count.|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt|Great. Let us start counting the HCP.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


sb|s|lb|*mHow many HCP you and dummy held from the start?^22~23~24~25~26~27^5^|
at|
Declarer: 0 + 10 + 4 + 5 = 19.|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


at| Dummy: 0 + 0 + 4 + 3 = 7.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


at| That sums up to 26. 
Therefore the opponents hold 14 HCP between them.|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


at|
East showed 10 HCP in @s and @cQ, which is enough for an opening, so West could hold the crucial @dQ.|sb|s|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


sb|sSo it is a pure guess with 50% chance to find the diamond Q?|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt|NOPE. The contract is 100% safe at this moment.
You learned not only to count HCP, but opponents distribution too.
I hope you watched their discards carefully??|sb|s|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt|What is the distribution of the @s-suit?|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


sb|sWest singleton and East 6|at| West: 1, East: 6|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


sb|s|at|
What do we know about the @hs?|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


sb|sWest had 2 hearts and East 3|at| West: 2, East: 3|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


sb|s|at|
Do you remember West's discards?|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


sb|sHmhh. He discarded 3 times. 2 diamonds and 1 club, if I remember correctly.|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


sb|s|at|
Correct, so how were the @cs distributed?|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


sb|sWest had 4 clubs and East 3|at| West: 4, East: 3|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


sb|s|at|
Please tell me about the @d distribution.|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


sb|sOnly West discarded 2 diamonds. Diamonds are not played yet. I have no idea.|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


sb|s|nt|Hmhh... Do you remember the magic number in Bridge?|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


sb|sYep, the 13.|
nt|Right. You counted East for 6@ss, 3@hs and 3@cs exactly. How many @ds must he hold????|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


sb|sEast started with a singleton diamond.|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


sb|s|nt|That's it. Congratulations!

Now it is plain sailing. Bang down @dK.|pc|dK|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


at|
Either the @dQ comes down from East in this trick, because he started with the stiff Q ......|pc|ddd|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


at|
or you can finesse West for that @dQ with 100% certainity.|
pc|dddts|sb|sBINGO! Many thanks! I got it.|
