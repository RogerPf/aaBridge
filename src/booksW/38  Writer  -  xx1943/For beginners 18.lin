{^c@2In this lesson we shall see a variant of Plan 3, the elimination play: 
It is described as the situation in which an opponent has to choose between 
leading towards a tenace or conceding a ruff and discard.  ^z}

cs|2|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |

{^c@2Questions you should always ask yourself before you adopt an elimination play:
^d1. Do I have a problem suit where I have to make a guess or where leading the suit (breaking it) may cost a trick?
^d2. Do I have enough trumps in both hands to make a ruff and sluff possible?
^d3. Is it possible to eliminate the side suits?
^d4. How will I put a defender on lead? ^z
}|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


at|
{^c@2Most elimination plays rely on a tenace in some suit. Often it is a holding which will benefit from a lead by an opponent. 
Let's see some examples:
^d1. Qxx  Jxx One trick is certain if suit is lead by an opponent.
^d2. AQT  xxx Two tricks are certain if neither opponent has a safe exit.
^d3.  AJx  KTx Three tricks are certain. ^z

{There are a lot of suit combinations, which you should avoid to lead yourself, but try to induce an opponent to do so:
AJx - K10x;   AJx - K9x;    A10x - K9x;   A9x -Q8x; A10x - Jxx;   Qxx - K109;   Q9x - K8x;    Jxx - Kxx;    Jxx - Qxx}|

pc|HHHkH|at|      but now the moment of truth has come:
What are the possible distributions of the critical @d suit?|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|1) If @ds were distributed 3-2 from the beginning, all is well.|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


at|
2) If West (who is on lead) held a singleton @d, he must give us now a ruff and discard.|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


at|
3) If East (not on lead) held the singleton @d, West has 3 alternatives:|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|West has 3 alternatives:
3)a) play a @h and give declarer a ruff and sluff|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


at|
3)b) play a low @d|pc|D|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


lb|*cWhich card do you play?^^dt^dkdtd2|up|1|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


at|
Did you find the right answer? Playing the King is obviously wrong as we would be endplayed. Playing the 2 would fail if wily West played low from QJxx. Playing the 10 is the right play as it wins whatever the distribution. If it loses to East, no problem as the @d distribution is 3-2 and we have only one loser in the suit. If we win the trick with the 10, we also make our bid.|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


At| 
3)c) play @d J or Q|pc|DJ|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


lb|*cWhich card do you play?^^d2^dkdtd2|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|Did you find the right answer? Playing the King is again obviously wrong as we would be endplayed. Also wrong would be playing the 10 because if  wily West started with QJ87 we are sure to lose 2 @ds tricks. The right play is to play the 2, keeping our tenace KT, in case West started with QJxx. If East can follow suit, then the distribution is 3-2 and all is well.|
