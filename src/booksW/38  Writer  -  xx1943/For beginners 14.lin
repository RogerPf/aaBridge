{^c@2Questions you should always ask yourself before you adopt Plan 2:
^d1. Is dummy's suit established or not?
^d2. Are those losers unavoidable or delayed?
^d3. Is there a dangerous opponent?
^d4. Are there enough entries? Do I need dummy's trumps as entries? ^z}|
cs|2|

at|

{^c@2The most important decision declarer has to make is: to draw opponent's trumps at once or postpone it.
There are 3 reasons to postpone:
^d1. You need dummy's trumps to ruff losers in your hand.
^d2. You need dummy's trumps as entries later.
^d3. You need dummy's trumps to be guarded against a ^*Bforcing game.^*N ^z}

I agree, the minor Aces take care of losers in the master-hand.
How many losers to get rid of?|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


lc|c6ad3a|sb|sOnly one. Surely you will ask now how I will do that?|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


at|
Grin.. was thinking about that. Tell us your thoughts, please.|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt||sb|sNo shortage in dummy.. so no ruffing in my dummy today|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


at|Ok.. surely you have more cards up your sleeve!|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


sb|sThere is a long suit in dummy. If I can establish diamonds I am home??|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


at|
Excellent.. How will diamonds most likely be distributed between opps?|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


sb|sThere are 6 cards out. 3-3 or more likely 4-2.|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


at|
Good thinking. You should plan for the most likely distribution, 4-2. |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


at|
Imagine the @dK or @dQ or the @dJ is at the head of the opp with 4 diamonds!!
How many times  do you have to lead diamonds?|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


sb|s4 times, and using DA as entry!|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


at|
Right on! How will you be able to lead a @d not one but 4 times?|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt||sb|sI can see 4 entries to dummy.|hc|sajcada|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


at|Well done.. what are you going to do with the lead?|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


sb|sYou taught me that a hold-up is sensible when they attack your weakest suit.|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


lc|sajcada|hs|shnh|sb|sHere a heart shift would result in creating two quick losers. So I must take the lead in dummy. |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


ls|nhsh|at|
Excellent! But if you take the lead in dummy, are you not using up one of your dummy entries? Remember that when you failed to make your bid in your earlier attempt you used the same plan and also took the lead in dummy. How will you play it this time to be successful?|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


sb|sHum... I see your point. If I do play the diamond Ace, followed by a small diamond...|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


sb|sI have 2 more trump entries to clear the diamond suit. |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


sb|sBut I need one more to reach dummy to use the last diamond. Can you help?|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


at|
Whenever you have an entry problem, a simple and effective technique should come to mind. We have used it in the past. Do you remember?|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


sb|sDucking also known as Coup à blanc?|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


at|
Yes. You will see that by using this technique you will be able to play the diamond suit 5 times, one more than in your first attempt.|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


sb|sOk. I will try starting with a Coup à blanc.|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|Do you draw trumps?|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


sb|sOf course not. Once on lead, defence could replay trumps to remove a dummy entry.|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


at|
OK.. let's go..|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


sb|s|pc|cacc|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


pc|dddd|sb|sCoup à blanc. As mentioned by Al, this will give me one more entry to dummy.|

sb|sIf I had drawn only 1 round of trumps; 1 entry gone.. bye bye contract|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt||at|Sure! And please remember your plan.. Keep playing diamonds!!! And use your entries well!|

You are welcome!|

I hope you kept count of how many trumps are with opps! And
how many times @d's are played already?|

To return to the counting.. You do not have to count all suits always.
On this board counting diamonds and spades would have been enough.|

pg| ***** 163 ***** |


sb|sAt least 2 heart losers, no losers in other suits.|
pg| ***** 164 ***** |

Correct! How can the number of heart losers be reduced ? Is it possible to set-up the suit or ruff losers in the short hand?|
pg| ***** 165 ***** |


sb|sNegative. In both cases we would still lose at least 2 tricks.|
pg| ***** 166 ***** |


sb|sThe only real possibility appears to be the Plan 2.|
pg| ***** 167 ***** |


at|
Very good! Do you have enough entries to protect against a probable 4-2 split ?|
pg| ***** 168 ***** |


sb|SYes. 3 entries are sufficient.|hc|skqdA|

I agree with you. What about drawing trumps?|lc|skqdA|

sb|s|at|
Yes. It does look strange. Could you have known about the danger of an over-ruff? Let me give you a useful rule to assess numerically the risks of an over-ruff.|
pg| ***** 181 ***** |

at|
{^a @2We add the total number of cards held in both hands with the number of the ruffing round. 
When this number reaches 10, there is a danger of an over-ruff. ^z}|
pg| ***** 182 ***** |


at|

For instance, here, the first ruff has a total of 9 (seven @ds cards in both hands + a ruff in the 2nd round) and is not dangerous.|
pg| ***** 183 ***** |


at|
But with the second ruff, the total is 10. So you know there is a high risk of over-ruff...|
sb|sThis will be useful indeed.|
pg| ***** 184 ***** |


sb|sTherefore with a Coup à blanc, the 2nd ruff will now have a total of 9....|
pg| ***** 185 ***** |


sb|swith only a slight risk of an over-ruff.|
pg| ***** 186 ***** |


nt|Great! You understood perfectly. Now you are ready to replay the hand.|
pg| ***** 187 ***** |

pg| ***** 190 ***** |


pc|ddsd|sb|sNow according to our new rule, this has a total of 9.|

Sounds like a good plan. Do you pull trumps?|
