Goulash hands show a lot of bidding principles just like a magnifying glass.

Here is the description from Wikipedia
^*Hen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goulash_(bridge)^*N
|fp|1|
at|
Goulash (also Ghoulie) is a style of playing the card game of bridge, normally in friendly play such as rubber bridge, in which the cards are not thoroughly shuffled between consecutive deals. The aim is to create deals where the suits are more unevenly distributed between the players, thus creating "wild" deals in order to make the game more vivid.

Goulash dealing has variations; basically, each player sorts the cards from the previous deal by suits, and all four hands are stacked back in the deck. The deck is then cut once or twice, and cards are then dealt in groups of 4-5-4 or 5-5-3, instead of one at a time as usual.

Some players play a goulash in rubber bridge only when the previous deal was passed out; others play full goulash rubbers. In both cases, at least a game must be bid in the goulash deal, otherwise, the partial (part score) contract is discarded and the goulash redealt.|

|fp|1|at|
When goulash dealing is in effect, many players adjust their bidding 
principles in some or all of the following ways in order to accommodate 
the anticipated wildness of the deal:

° Only five-card suits may be bid.

° Weak balanced hands (in 12-15 high card points range) are passed rather than opened.

° Preemptive openings are forbidden; instead, a high-level opening bid denotes the exact number of tricks the hand possesses.

° Conventions are highly reduced, as opponents will often interfere and break up the subtle information exchange.

° Doubles behind a bidder are for penalties, where they would usually be for take out.|

^*Hbridgehands.com/G/goulash.htm^*N
|fp|1|at|

It’s not uncommon for players to have 7 or more cards in a suit, or perhaps 
a two-suited hand. And yes, your opponent will often have surprising length 
in your suit, so beware! Needless to say, goulash dealing in not in 
accordance with the Laws of Contract Bridge, but when players are looking 
for some real action as a diversion from "real Bridge", goulash dealing can provide loads of fun – provided the players have a good sense of humor.|

rh||ah|Board 01|ah|Twilight Zone (1)|ah|No fit anywhere|
sv|0|pf||sk||
nt|This hand is a nightmare. There are too much possibilities. I composed it to demonstrate the danger (misfit) and the possible benefit of bicolor hands. If you fear a misfit, you should pass as soon as possible. But if you see a fit, bid boldly: when in doubt bid 1 or even 2 more.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


sk|n|mb|1s|nt|Never open a bicolor with broken suits with 2@c.
|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


sk|e|at|East must be alarmed. There is a great misfit in @S but partner may have the @h so bid them.
|mb|2h|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


sk|s|at|I personally tend to pass this South hand: void in partner's major and 6 cards in opp's suit... But 3@c is reasonable too.
|mb|3c|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


sk|W|at|Now everybody at the table heard the misfit.
|mb|3d|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


sk|n|mb|x|an|?|nt|Is a double from North for penalty now?|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


ub|1|mb|3s|an|?|at| This is reasonable but very dangerous.
Q: North's free bid 3@s is not wise... If partner has @Ss he can bid them.
A: You are right.
|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


sk|E|mb|x|an|penalty|at|I would double for penalties with the East hand now. You and your partner should know exactly which doubles are for penalty or not.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


sk||nt|OK, this hand is not to analyze. I've checked by "DealMaster Pro" software how many tricks could be made. It took about 5 hours to find out that North can make 7 tricks in @S.
VANYVON: West of all players should 'know' of a complete misfit and pass... Since South can not support spades then East has @hs and @Ss, therefore East can not support @ds... But not easy at the table.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt|Q: This analysis is for the bidding in goulash tourneys or in common ones?

A: The analysis is for every tournament. Be cautious with freakish hands, if you suppose there is a misfit. But bid boldly with a fit.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt|I'm astonished: the traveller shows only 4 doubles at 11 tables (4@hx East twice, 3@hx East once and 5@sx North once)! I thought there would be more doubles at least.
The highest contracts declared were 5@c South (bid once, down 4), 5@d West (once, down 4), 5@h East (once, down 6) and 5@sX North (once, down 6). Results are in the range from 4@hX E -5 (1100 points, score 14.40) to 5@sX N -6 (-1400, -17.00).|

rh||ah|Board 02|ah|Twilight Zone (2)|ah|Great fit everywhere|
sv|n|pf||nt|This hand is identical with B01 except that East and West hands are exchanged. Now N-S can make 13 tricks in @S and E-W are entitled to a grand in @c.
|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


sk|e|mb|1c|at|With bicolor I bid the longer minor before the major.
|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


sk|s|at|South has a perfect Michaels showing 5-5 in majors and below opening strength or 16+HCP or equivalent playing strength.|mb|2c|an|5+/5+ in majors|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


sk|W|nt|Now West sees a great fit, void in both opp's suits, @dA and @cK. I would bid at once as high I want to go. That is an old saying by great Edgar Kaplan: Bid at once as high as you want to go anyway.|mb|7c|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


sk|n|at| Now it is easy for North, knowing of at least a 12 card spade fit, to bid 7@S. When in doubt bid 1 more (with a great fit).|mb|7s|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


sk||nt|In this case 7@s is cold on a cross-ruff on any lead.
Q: Should E-W bid 7NT as sacrifice?
A: 7NT sacrifice is good. Down 8 (7 spades and @HA), doubled, nonvulnerable, is 2000 and grand slam in majors, vulnerable, is 2210.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|Q: If East opens 3@c then South with this hand doubles?
A: If East opens 3@c (which is a terrible bid imho) South should bid 4@c (Michaels Cue).

Q: What if East opens 2@h? Bad bid too?
A: Yep. Preemptive openings 3@c or 2@h are never bicolor.|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|At some tables N-S even didn't mention their 13-cards @S fit. One declarer made only 12 tricks in spades (didn't play on cross ruff).
The highest contracts declared were 7@c East (once, made) and 7@s by South and North (twice doubled, once undoubled, made).
Results are in the range from 7@sX N = (2470 points, score 17.70) to 7@c E = (-1440, -14.40)|

Results are in the range from 4@s E -5 (500 points, score 5.80) to 1NT W = (-90, -8.40)|

Q: Can N open with 25 HCP 3NT?
A: 3NT is AKQxxxxx in a minor as I play.|
pg| ***** 101 ***** |


nt|The highest contracts declared was 7@s by North, bid at 6 of 11 tables, made 3 times; it was defeated at 3 tables without the use of the Lightner double. Good Goulash thinking from the defenders!!!

Results are in the range from 7@s N = (2210 points, score 12.80) to 7@s N -2 (-200, -14.00)|

nt|This is the famous hand illustrating Marty Bergen's phrase "points schmoints". East-West, holding together 35 HCPs, can make 6@h, 6@d or 6@c, but North-South, holding only 5 HCPs, can make 13 tricks in @S against any defense. This is the minimum of HCPs you need to make a grand. But how to get there?|

nt|Another famous hand. With 13 spades in his hand West can bid safe 7@S, but North wins 7NT because poor East cannot lead his partner's suit.|
pg| ***** 144 ***** |


mb|2c|at|
West, of course, can bid 7@s at once, but going slowly with forcing bids he can provoke the penalty double by opponents and get the top score redoubling it.
But at the same time this is the only way for N-S to find 7NT.|
pg| ***** 145 ***** |


nt|I admit this hand is boring to analyse. Maybe it would be more interesting if North was the dealer.

There were only two contracts declared: 7@sXX by West (4 times) and 7@s West (7 times), all made (of course :)).
Results were 7@s W = (-1500 points, score 4.80) and 7@sXX W = (-2240, -8.40)|
