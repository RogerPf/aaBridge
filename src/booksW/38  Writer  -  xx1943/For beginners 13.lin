The play of a suit contract is in general much more complicated than to play a NT-contract. 
To get a better idea you might look up this page:
^*Hwww.albrecht-hollstein.de/Bridge/Lessons/Play a suit contract/How to play Suit-contract summary.htm^*N|

fp|3|cs|7|cp|9|at|

^c@2{This is a general rule in suit-contracts too:
Make your plan of play, BEFORE you touch a card in dummy!!! ^z}
|
cs|2|fp||cp||
at|
{^c@2In the last lessons we learned that in a suit contract we count primarily the number of losers, not the sure tricks. You count the losers of the main hand (which is generally that one with the more trumps.^z}|
cs|8|
at|

{^c@2The ways to avoid losers are:
^d Plan 1: Ruff with dummy's trumps.
^d Plan 2: Discard on dummy's long suit.
^d Plan 3: Make tricks with lower honors by finessing.
^d Plan 4: Score extra tricks in trumps
^d        (e.g. cross-ruff; dummy reversal; trump coup).

{^c@2In this lesson we shall see some more examples of Plan 2 again: 
Discard losers on dummy's long suit. }|

To get a better idea you might look up this page:
^*Hwww.albrecht-hollstein.de/Bridge/Lessons/Play a suit contract/How to play Suit-contract summary.htm^*N

{^c@2Questions you should always ask yourself before you adopt Plan 2:
^d1. Is dummy's suit established or not?
^d2. Are those losers unavoidable or delayed?
^d3. Is there a dangerous opponent?
^d4. Are there enough entries? Do I need dummy's trumps as entries?}|
cs|2|

at|

{^c@2The most important decision declarer has to make is: to draw opponent's trumps at once or postpone it.
There are 3 reasons to postpone:
^d1. You need dummy's trumps to ruff losers in your hand.
^d2. You need dummy's trumps as entries later.
^d3. You need dummy's trumps to be guarded against a ^*Bforcing game.^*N}
