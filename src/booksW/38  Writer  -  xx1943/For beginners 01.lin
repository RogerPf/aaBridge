at|^c@2{* Make your plan of play, BEFORE you touch a card in dummy!!!

* The plan for a NT contract consists of the following steps:
^d@21. Count your sure tricks in high cards.
2. Calculate how many additional tricks are needed to make your bid.
3. Decide from which suit these tricks may come from.
4. Be aware what can damage your plan.
    4.1 Can opponents do me any harm?
    4.2 Is there a dangerous opponent?
    4.3 Are there enough entries to my long suit (either in dummy or in my hand)
    4.4 Is there a danger to block suits?
    4.5 What do I discard, when a long suit is played?

^c@2* The Hold-up play is a great weapon to cut off the opponents communication 
^d(transportation).

* The RULE OF 7 tells how often you should normally hold up

pg| ***** 47 ***** |


at|There is one more question to ask: What damage can be done by defenders?|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


sb|SWhat damage can be done by defenders?|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|Defenders can cash 4@s tricks along with the @cA.|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


at||sb|SHow can I prevent this?|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|There are 13 @s-cards in the deck. You and dummy own 6 of them.
So defenders have got 7 @ss. These can be distributed 7-0, 6-1, 5-2 or 4-3.|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|Let us assume that West has led from a long @s-suit (4, 5, 6 or 7 cards).
There is no problem if the distribution is 4-3. They can only cash 4 tricks (3@s and @cA).
If @s are 7-0 or 6-1 and the @cA is with East, he cannot reach West to give him the lead to cash his high @ss.
The only critical situation is a 5-2 distribution with East holding @cA and exactly 2 @ss.|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


at||sb|SOhhhhhhhhhh, I guess I got it!|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


sb|SI have to refuse the first trick and destroy defenders transportation.|

pc|sQsssA|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


pc|cKccc|at|
Defenders are allowed to hold-up too LOL.|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


pc|cQccc|nt|Now the contract is safe as long as West holds the longer @s-suit.
If East has got another @s, that means the suit is distributed 4-3 and defenders make only 3 @s-tricks.
And if the suit is distributed 5-2, East has no other @s to return.|

Declarer mixed up "sure" tricks with "potential" tricks. After the first trick declarer had 1@h+6@c=7 sure tricks and 3 more "potential" tricks in the red suits.

Now declarer has 1@h+2@d+6@c=9 sure tricks.
Opponents can cash at most 2 red Aces and @sA and K.
So you can claim 9 tricks at once or wait for a defensive slip (maybe they present you with a 10th trick LOL).|
