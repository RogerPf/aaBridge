pg| ***** 35 ***** |


at| + 0@d|hc|d|

pg| ***** 38 ***** |


lc|sAkqhAkqdakqcAkq|at||sb|SHow many tricks are needed to make my bid?|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


at|
To make 3NT we need 9 tricks, so we need 9 - 5 = 4 more.|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


at||sb|SWhich suit(s) may provide this additional trick?|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


at|
@ss can make 1 additional trick. @hs can make no additional tricks.
@ds can make 5 additional tricks.
@cs can make 1 additional tricks, if the suit is divided 4-3.|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|So the best (only) chance for 4 additional tricks is the @d-suit.|

You shouldn't be a moneysaving housewife. You had to give up a potential overtrick to ensure your contract. You need an entry to the table ^*bafter^*n the @ds are established.|sb|s|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|Go back a few tricks and try again.|up|21|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


sb|sHow can i make an entry to dummy?|
%%%% Hi Yvon/Ronald take it from here

%%%% entry saved but wrong sequence
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


at| That's the right question!
answer: Only in @s's you can find an entry. If the @sK is gone and you can still reach the @sJ or @sQ you have your entry. Do not be greedy!! take over the @sT with your @sA.. Now your hand is unblocked.. whoever has the @sK can only take it, after which the @sJ is an entry or leave it, and then you are in dummy to play your @d's.|

pg| ***** 93 ***** |


up|23|nt||sb|s|
at|Very good!! Now the rule of 11 can help us.. if the @s5 was fourth from an honour and denying a sequence of three then there must be 11-5=6 spades higher than the 5 in the other hands:
|
pg| ***** 94 ***** |


sb|s|hc|sjak96|at|I see 5 of them.. leaves one with opps..|
pg| ***** 95 ***** |


pc|ss|at| And there is number 6!!  All the other high spades are with west. So after i have driven out the @dA, i take a sure finesse over west.|

ls|ndsd|
%%% card reading?? s8 from east can not be on-sign so is nearly sure a singleton?
%%%%%%
at|Not everybody plays 4th from top. Some play that small promises honour, denies (internal) serie. Your reasoning should be about the same. West leads from longest strongest and promises an honour. @sQ and @sT are out. There is more chance that the all important @sQ is with west if west opened really his longest/strongest. But in the end, playing West for the @sQ is really your only chance for making your bid!!!!|
pg| ***** 106 ***** |


nt|So therefore "cherchez la femme" with west|

sb|sso where do i find the three extra tricks i need?|
pg| ***** 115 ***** |


at|
Good question.. if @s's are 3-3 maybe 1 length trick there; but you have to give lead to the opps twice !! @h's?.. no chance for extra trick..|
pg| ***** 116 ***** |


nt||at|@c's? maybe one trick if you give opps two times the lead!!
@d's? @dQ and @d9 missing..@d's most likely distributed 3-2..You may hope that if @dQ  has fallen, the @d9 has also. @d suit is your best option. |
pg| ***** 117 ***** |

pg| ***** 118 ***** |

up|51|nt|Playing a holdup is good.. only if you need not to worry about weakness elsewhere in your hands..
|
pg| ***** 135 ***** |


hs|sh|at|Look at those @h's!! If @hA is gone the other @htricks are to opponents.. remember 8 hearts with opps.. 5-3 distributed.. 1 @htrick for you, 4 to opps. Exactly what happened !! So that's the first part of your plan. You cannot afford to hold-up since the opps could switch to @h and set-up their own long suit before you had the chance to set-up your @ds. Take that @sK with your @sA!|
pg| ***** 136 ***** |


nt||ls|sh|sb|sOk boss|
pc|ss8sa|
pg| ***** 137 ***** |


sb|swhat now?|hs|ndsd|
at|You still have to make your 3 extra tricks from @d's.
Let us assess the risks: no coverage in spades.. so if East or West comes to the lead you only can hope you lose 3 @stricks if @s's are distributed 4-3.|
pg| ***** 138 ***** |


at| And once @hA is gone... well you know ^*bthat^*n story.|
pg| ***** 139 ***** |


at|
Conclusion: if diamonds are not established when and if your @hA is gone.. you are gone.|
pg| ***** 140 ***** |


nt|You need 2 entries to establish AND enjoy the @ds. So don't be a scarcy  housewife. Overtake the K with the A.|
pg| ***** 141 ***** |


pc|dkddAd|sb|s|at|
Correct play! You still needed to overtake the @dk to preserve your entry to dummy.|

at|^c@2{Make your plan of play, BEFORE you touch a card in dummy!!! ^z}
#4{The plan for a NT contract consists of the following steps:
^d@21) Count your sure tricks in high cards.
2) Calculate how many additional tricks are needed to make your bid.
3) Decide from which suit these tricks may come from.
4) Be aware what can damage your plan.
^e@24.1 Have opponents a long suit to run before you run your tricks??
4.2 Is there a dangerous opponent?
4.3 Are there enough entries to my long suit (either in dummy or in my hand)
4.4 Is there a danger to block suits?
4.5 What do I discard, when a long suit is played? ^z}|

{^c@2As last time in this lesson we emphasize topic 4.3. ^z}
#4{Count how many entries to your long suit do you need to establish AND enjoy it. ^z}
#4{Be careful with your entries. Be sure, that you can reach dummy, ^*Bafter^*N you established
 a long suit. ^z}
#4{Learn not to be scarcy housewife. It often pays to give up 1 trick to gain 3 or more in return. ^z}
#4{It sometimes pays to play a unnecessary high card. ^z}
