sb|s"Coup en blanc"?? What is it?|nt|The key play is to lead a club at trick 2 and "duck" in dummy. This is called a "Coup en blanc". Not to be confused with a "Coup de blanc" which is a glass of white wine..lol|

sb|sok, let's try this.|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


pc|ccK|at| By ducking you have maintained the communication with the dummy. So that when you get back the lead you will be able to play a club to dummy's ace and assuming both opponents follow suit, you will be able to play a third club to set-up the suit.|

True. In that case you will not be able to set-up the suit against a good defence. But on the same line of thought, what can you do to protect against West holding @dQxxx?|

Well done! Needing only 4 tricks, you did not need to play the finesse right away. As you just did, you could concede a trick (coup en blanc) to protect against West holding @dQxxx. It is called a safety play.|sb|sThanks Al|

{The plan for a NT contract consists of the following steps:
^d@21) Count your sure tricks in high cards.
2) Calculate how many additional tricks are needed to make your bid.
3) Decide from which suit these tricks may come from.
4) Be aware what can damage your plan.
^e@24.1 Have opponents a long suit to run before you run your tricks??
4.2 Is there a dangerous opponent?
4.3 Are there enough entries to my long suit (either in dummy or in my hand)
4.4 Is there a danger to block suits?
4.5 What do I discard, when a long suit is played? ^z}|
