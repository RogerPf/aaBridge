The play of a suit contract is in general much more complicated than to play a NT-contract. 
To get a better idea you might look up this page:
^*Hwww.albrecht-hollstein.de/Bridge/Lessons/Play a suit contract/How to play Suit-contract summary.htm^*N|
at|

^c@2{This is a general rule in suit-contracts too: Make your plan of play, BEFORE you touch a card in dummy!!! ^z}
|
cs|2|
at|
{^c@2In a suit contract we count primarily the number of losers, not the sure tricks. ^z}|
cs|8|
at|

{^c@2The two most important ways to avoid losers are:
^d Plan 1: Ruff with dummy's trumps.
^d Plan 2: Discard on dummy's long suit.
{^c@2In this lesson we shall see some variations of Plan 2: Discard losers on dummy's long suit. }|
cs|2|
at|

{^c@2Questions you should always ask yourself before you adopt Plan 2:
^d1. Is dummy's suit established or not?
^d2. Are those losers unavoidable or delayed?
^d3. Is there a dangerous opponent?
^d4. Are there enough entries? Do I need dummy's trumps as entries?}|
cs|8|
at|

{^c@2The most important decision declarer has to make is: to draw opponent's trumps at once or postpone it.
There are 3 reasons to postpone:
^d1. You need dummy's trumps to ruff losers in your hand.
^d2. You need dummy's trumps as entries later.
^d3. You need dummy's trumps to be guarded against a ^*Bforcing game.^*N}

Reminder: In suit-contracts you count the losers in the master-hand (normally the hand with more trumps).|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


at|
The master-hand here is South.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


at|
South's losers are: 1@s |hc|s4|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at| + 2@d|hc|d36|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |

nt|Prospects seem bad: There is no shortness in dummy to ruff (except trumps LOL).
There are no lower honors or intermediates to try for a finesse or endplay.|lc|s4d36c7|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|
We can count the winners: 2@s+6@h+1@d=9 with the same result:
We are a trick short.|hc|sakda|hs|sh|

Seems there is no chance at all. |lc|sakda|ls|sh|
sb|sWait a moment. What about these nice little clubs in dummy?|hs|nc|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt|Yeah, you are right: The @c suit in dummy is a long suit. 
If the opponents @cs are distributed 4-3, you can establish an additional trick.

Go for it.|sb|s|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


sb|SWhat about entries to dummy's hand?|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt|You have 2@s+2@h+1@d=5 entries to the table. That is enough since you will lose the lead 4 times to set-up the @c suit. The last entry will allow you to use the last @c in dummy for a discard.|sb|s|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


sb|SDo I draw the trumps first?|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt|NOPE ..........................................It is needed as an entry to dummy.|sb|s|

South with the longer trump suit is obviously the master-hand.|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |

How many losers do you have?|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


sb|s1 heart (if the break is fair) + 2 spades + 2 diamonds = 5.|hc|h2s63dq9|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |

The @s lead is unlucky. Why?|lc|h2s63dq9|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


sb|sBecause we are faced with 4 quick losers.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


at|
How can we avoid at least one loser?|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


sb|sOn extra winners in the club suit.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


at|
Exactly. But first you need to consider the danger of a ruff. Do you play on trumps and how many rounds if you do?|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


sb|sWe play exactly 2 rounds. Hoping for a 3-2 split.|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


at|
Correct. And what do we hope for to make our bid?|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


sb|sThat the opp holding the last trump also has at least 2 club cards.|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt|In effect, you hope that the opps will be forced to ruff a @s loser, the one that will be discarded on the 3rd club..... 
Let's execute the plan... 
First hold up the lead just in case opponent cannot read partner's signal and misdefends.|

How could East take the lead?|

That would be bad play. East must play honour promoting his other honour in the suit. 
So, hoping for opponents to make a mistake is not a good plan. Any other idea?|
pg| ***** 99 ***** |


sb|SI give up. Please give me a hint.|
pg| ***** 100 ***** |


up|9|nt|Of course. Tell me, would it be easier for you if you can rid of one club, remaining with only two?|

So....| 
pg| ***** 103 ***** |


sb|SBut how? I can use only a diamond J, but East can have the Q!|
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


at|
Another hint: What is the lead?|
pg| ***** 105 ***** |


sb|SYes! West's K promises the Q, so I can play the J safely!|
at|
Fine... Now, the next step in the plan: do you have enough entries to the table?|
pg| ***** 106 ***** |


sb|SI need 3 entries to establish clubs and 1 more to enjoy them.|
pg| ***** 107 ***** |


sb|SI can use 3 trumps and the club K, so I have enough.|

What does it mean, should you draw trumps and if yes, how many?|
