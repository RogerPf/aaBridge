{^c@2In this lesson we shall see a variant of Plan 3, the elimination play: 
It is described as the situation in which an opponent has to choose between 
leading towards a tenace or conceding a ruff and discard.  ^z}
|
cs|2|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


at|
{^c@2Questions you should always ask yourself before you adopt an elimination play:
^d1. Do I have a problem suit where I have to make a guess or where leading the suit (breaking it) may cost a trick?
^d2. Do I have enough trumps in both hands to make a ruff and sluff possible?
^d3. Is it possible to eliminate the side suits?
^d4. How will I put a defender on lead? ^z|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


at|
{^c@2Most elimination plays rely on a tenace in some suit. Often it is a holding which will benefit from a lead by an opponent. 
Let's see some examples:
^d1. Qxx  Jxx One trick is certain if suit is lead by an opponent.
^d2. AQT  xxx Two tricks are certain if neither opponent has a safe exit.
^d3.  AJx  KTx Three tricks are certain. ^z

{There are a lot of suit combinations, which you should avoid to lead yourself, but try to induce an opponent to do so:
AJx – K10x;   AJx – K9x;    A10x – K9x;   A9x –Q8x; A10x – Jxx;   Qxx - K109;   Q9x – K8x;    Jxx – Kxx;    Jxx – Qxx}|

However if East has the 4th., there are 2 possibilities:
1) throw him in in @d, maybe he makes the mistake to give you a ruff and sluff. OR
2) Ruff the last @d go back to @hA and lead a low @c and hope the make a mistake and West wins that trick.|
