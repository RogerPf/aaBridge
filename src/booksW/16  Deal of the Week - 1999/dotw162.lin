bt||rh||ah|Deal of the|ah|Week #162|nt|
The 1999 China Cup International Bridge Championship was played last week in Shenzhen, China. This tournament is only 4 years old and has already established itself as one of the most presitigious and well run events in the world. The Chinese Bridge Association and Phillip Morris Inc. (the main sponsor) deserve a great deal of credit for running a sensational bridge tournament.

Fred Gitelman, the President of Bridge Base Inc., was fortunate enough to be invited to play in the 1999 China Cup as a member of the North American team. North America finished second in the 4 team event behind Europe (Magnus Lindkvist-Peter Fredin from Sweden, Soren Chrustiansen-Morten Andersen, and Jens Auken-Dennis Koch Palmund, all from Denmark).

The Women's Teams was won by the World Bridge Stars, Sabine Auken-Kirsten Moller (Germany-Denmark), Barbara Stawowy-Katrin Farwig (Germany), and Sylvie Willard-Benedicte Cronier (France).

Defending champions Fu Zhong and Ju Chuancheng of China truimphed again in the strong 32-pair IMP pairs event. Fred Gitelman playing in a first-time partnership with Denmark's Steen Moller (the NPC of both of the winning teams) finished a respectable fifth.

Thanks to everyone involved for making the 1999 China Cup such an enjoyable experience!

This week we are presenting three of our favorite deals from the 1999 China Cup. Some of these have been rotated to make South the declarer.|

See if you can do better. The final contract is 6@S.|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


pc|cj|nt|West's opening lead is the @CJ. 6@S is not a very good contract, but that is what you have to play. Think about how you would play before reading on.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


hs|ndsd|nt|South has 2 diamond losers to deal with. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


ls|ndsd|hs|nc|at|North's clubs will provide a parking place for 1 of these losers. |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


ls|nc|hs|nhsh|at|It looks like the heart suit will have to be played for 4 tricks (or guess the @HQ and play for a squeeze) in order to take care of South's other diamond loser.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


ls|nhsh|

hs|nc|nt|South can give himself an extra chance by playing a low club from dummy at trick 1. 

|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


ls|nc|pc|c|sk||hs|ecwc|at|Clubs were actually 6-2 when this deal came up and it was necessary to duck at trick 1 in order to make 6@S.|

pg| ***** 13 ***** |


hs|nhsh|hc|hq|at|After South draws trump he has some guessing to do in the heart suit, but the 6-2 club break suggests that East should be finessed for the @HQ.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


ls|nhsh|lc|hq|

nt|If the @CA had not fallen, South could later take a ruffing finesse against that card and be in roughly the same position as he would have been had he played a club honor from dummy on the first trick.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt|The analysis that is presented here is a little superficial as South does give up some of his squeeze chances by playing as suggested. On balance, however, we think that the unusual trick 1 duck is the correct play.|

pc|s|nt|West leads the @S9 in response to his partner's overcall. Think about how you would play before reading on.

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1c|mb|3s|an|Preemptive|mb|d|an|Negative|mb|p|nt|Sylvie opened 1@C in 3rd position and West preempted with 3@S. Benedicte made a negative double as North. What call would you make as South? |

mb|3n|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Sylvie, in a very uncomfortable situation, tried 3NT. Perhaps partner will have something in spades... |
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


sk||hs|nswses|at|Nope. This was the actual deal. As you can see the defense can win the first 7 tricks in spades. West, however, thought that Sylvie was likely to have the guarded @SQ.|

Sylvie had won 8 tricks, but she was through. -100 was a pretty good score, especially considering how other possible actions over her partner's negative double might have fared!|
