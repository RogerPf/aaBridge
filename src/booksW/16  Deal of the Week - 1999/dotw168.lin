bt||rh||ah|Deal of the|ah|Week #168|

nt|
Unfortunately Bridge Base Inc. employees had no high placings in last week's North American Championships in Boston. The story of this tournament was Rita Shugart and teamates Andrew Robson, Geir Helgemo, and Tony Forrester. The Shugart team won both the Open Board-A-Match Teams and the Reisinger (they were the defending champions in this event).

One of the nice things about bridge is that even if your results are terrible there are always plenty of interesting deals. This week's deal is a defensive problem that took place in the Blue Ribbon Pairs in Boston. Jill Meyers and John Mohan won the Blue Ribbon Pairs. Jill is the only woman to have won this prestigious event since Dorothy Truscott and B.J. Becker won the first Blue Ribbon Pairs in 1963.

Online vugraph of the Reisinger final will be available on the ACBL web site (www.acbl.org) within the next few days.|

hs|wh|nt|
South passes and you open 1@H as West. North-South are vulnerable (the graphic in the top left corner of this display illustrates the vulnerability).|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |

mb|2H|an|Michaels cuebid|

nt|
North's 2@H is a Michaels cuebid, conventionally showing 5 or more spades and 5 or more cards in one of the minor suits. |
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


mb|4H|an|Preemptive raise|

nt|
Your partner's 4@H bid is preemptive by agreement. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


mb|4s|mb|5H|at|South bids 4@S and you soldier on with 5@H. |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


mb|5S|mb|P|mb|P|nt|
West bids 5@S, passed around to you. Would you pass, double, or bid 6@H? 

|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|
Sorry, but we don't know the "right" answer here. North probably thinks he is making 5@S and you have no reason to believe he is wrong given your limited defense. The Law of Total Tricks suggests that 6@H will be a good sacrifice against 5@S.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|
Then again, bidding 6@H could push the opponents into a making slam. Although it is unlikely, 6@H could go down 4 tricks for -800. Also, it is possible that 5@S is going down. This is a very hard bidding problem.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


mb|P|nt|Suppose you choose to pass (most experts we talked to passed when faced with this problem). 5@S is the final contract.

|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


pc|HK|at|You choose to lead the @HK and North puts down a powerful dummy. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


pc|H2|pc|H9|pc|H8|

nt|Your @HK wins the first trick as partner follows with the @H9 and declarer plays the @H8. Your partnership has agreed to play suit preference signals in this type of situation.

|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


hc|da|at|Do you cash your @DA at trick 2? Remember, you are playing matchpoints.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


sk||nt|On the actual deal you had better cash your @DA or you will get a very poor matchpoint score. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sd|at|If you do not play your @DA then both of declarer's diamonds will be discarded on dummy's clubs. Notice that the winning action was for you to sacrifice in 6@H which would be down only 2 tricks for -300.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sd|

nt|You may have thought that dummy's menacing club suit makes it obvious to cash the @DA at trick 2. Indeed, many players would not even think about this problem if it arose at the table. If you think about it, however, it is far from clear to cash the @DA.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


md|0dq,,,dk|hs|ed|hs|eh|lc|da|nt|First of all, you should know that your partner does not have the @DK. If he was dealt that card he would have dropped his highest heart under your @HA as a "command" to play a diamond at trick 2. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|ed|hs|nc|hs|sd|md|0dk,,,dq|at|Cashing the @DA is not right because partner "might have the @DK" - you should know he doesn't have that card. Cashing the @DA can only be right because it is going away on the clubs.|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sd|

md|0d2,,,dj|hs|ed|nt|
Partner's @H9 looked like a "highish" heart, suggesting something good in diamonds, but not the @DK. Perhaps East was dealt the @DQ and @DJ. In this case it could be very wrong to cash the @DA at trick 2. |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


ls|ed|

md|0d63,,,s2hj|hs|nc|hs|sd|nt|
Suppose for example that declarer was dealt the above distribution (5143). Declarer can now disard only 2 of his diamonds on dummy's clubs. The defense will eventually come to 2 diamond tricks if you just sit back and wait. Exiting a spade or a club will defeat 5@S on this lie of the cards.|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


md|0s2,,,d3|nt|
On some distributions it will not matter if you play your @DA or not. On the above layout (6133), for example, the club suit will take care of 2 of declarer's diamonds, but he will be left with a diamond loser and your @DA will not go away.|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


md|0hj,,,d6|nt|
It turns out that the only distribution that makes it necessary to cash the @DA at trick 2 is the one that the declarer was actually dealt (6223). On all other distributions the @DA never gains - it can only lose.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sd|

hs|wc|hs|ws|lc|da|nt|So it is certainly reasonable to go passive and exit in spades or clubs at trick 2.

|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


hc|da|ls|ws|ls|wc|hs|eh|at|One final thought - perhaps East (who has a better idea that declarer might be 6223) should play his highest heart at trick 1, pretending to have the @DK so that partner will cash the @DA at trick 2.|
