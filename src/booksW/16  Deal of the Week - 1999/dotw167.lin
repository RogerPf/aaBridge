nt||bt||rh||ah|Deal of the|ah|Week #167|nt|
The 1999 Fall North American Championships are currently taking place in Boston. Bridge Base President, Fred Gitelman, and Vice President, Sheri Winestock, are playing in this tournament. Hopefully we will have some good results to report by the end of the week.

This week's deal was played by Sheri in the second qualifying session of the nationally rated Women's Board-A-Match Teams. Sheri was playing with Chicago's Judy Wadas when this week's deal was played. Sheri and Judy conducted an intelligent completely natural auction, which unfortunately landed them in a dicey contact. Sheri read the cards well, however, and showed good technique to make her contract and win the board for her team.

Reminder: The Deal of the Week software gives you the option of displaying bridge deals using either pictures of playing cards or hand diagrams. When you go on to the next page the deal will be displayed using hand diagrams. As soon as the button with the @SA becomes enabled you will be able to switch the display to pictures of cards (by clicking that button).|

The final contract of 2NT was not a thing of beauty, but we like Sheri and Judy's auction. The temptation to play in notrump at board-a-match (or matchpoints) can often be hard to resist.|

hs|ncsc|at|Sheri was unsure about the heart distribution and wanted to play on clubs without giving West a chance to gain the lead. She therefore tried a club to dummy's @C10 and East's @CQ.|

hs|ncsc|nt|Looking at all the cards we can see that Sheri could have now played a club to her @CK, dropping West's @CJ. The @C9 would then represent her 8th trick. |
