nt|
You are sitting South and pick up this strange hand. The opponents are vulnerable and you are not (you can see this with the indicator in the top left corner of the deal). You breathe a sigh of relief at being at favorable vulnerability.|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


mb|p|mb|p|mb|5c|nt|
After two passes East, a normally conservative bidder, opens 5@C.|

mb|6c|mb|p|mb|6d|mb|p|mb|6h|nt|
After a 5@C opening on your right, you choose to bid 6@C and correct your partner's 6@D to 6@H in order to show a strong major suit hand.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|
6@H is the final contract.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


pc|c|nt|
The opening lead is the @CJ and your partner puts down a very nice dummy. Try not to disappoint him. Think about how you would play before reading on.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


pc|cq|pc|ck|pc|h|nt|
Trick 1 seems easy. The @CJ is covered by the @CQ and @CK and ruffed in the South hand.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


hs|nhsh|nt|It seems natural to draw one round of trump before starting on spades.

|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


ls|nhsh|pc|h|pc|h|pc|hq|pc|c|at|Suppose you play a heart to dummy's @HQ. East discards a club, revealing the 3-0 trump break.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|It's time to turn your attention to spades.

|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


ls|nsss|pc|s|pc|s|pc|sa|pc|s|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


pc|sk|pc|s|pc|s|pc|c|at|East discards on the second round of spades, leaving West with 2 high spades.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


hs|ssnh|nt|
A spade is ruffed in the dummy.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


ls|ssnh|
pc|s|pc|s|pc|h|pc|c|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


hs|nhsh|nt|
You can get back to your hand in hearts |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


ls|nhsh|
pc|h|pc|c|pc|ha|pc|h|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


hs|ssnh|at|and establish the spade suit with another ruff in the dummy.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


ls|nhss|pc|s|pc|s|pc|h|pc|c|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


hs|ncsh|nt|
You now have the problem of getting back to your hand to draw the last trump. Ruffing a club would be dangerous - if East started with 9 clubs, West will score an overruff.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


ls|ncsh|hs|nd|nt|You therefore play a diamond from dummy, hoping that West will have to win the trick.

|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


ls|nd|pc|d|sk||hs|ec|nt|Bad news: Here are the remaining cards. East was, in fact, dealt 9 clubs.

|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


ls|ec|hs|ed|at|More bad news: East was dealt a top honor diamonds.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


ls|ed|
pc|dk|pc|d|pc|d|nt|
Terrible news: East is wide awake and hops up with the @DK to win the trick.|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


hs|ecwh|nt|
A club return by East will now promote a heart trick in West's hand.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


ls|ecwh|up|28|nt|
Let's go back to trick 2 where we have just ruffed West's club opening lead. Can you see where we went wrong?|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|
It is already too late. The fatal mistake came at trick 1. It is impossible to make 6@H from this point even looking at all 52 cards.|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


hs|nc|up|3|nt|
We have now backed up to trick 1. There are 2 keys plays that must be made. First, you have to play dummy's @C4 to the first trick!|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


ls|nc|pc|c|hs|ec|nt|
Suppose East makes the natural looking play of a low club.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


ls|ec|pc|c|

hs|sd|nt|
The other key trick 1 play is for South to discard his singleton diamond, allowing West to win the trick.|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


ls|sd|pc|d|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


hs|ndsh|nt|
The play will continue as before, the difference being that South will be able to use safe diamond ruffs as entries to his hand. |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


ls|ndsh|hs|edwd|nt|South's diamond discard is an example of a scissors coup, aptly named since this play cuts the defenders' diamond communications. |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


ls|edwd|hs|ecwh|at|As a a result East, is prevented from gaining the lead to play a club for a trump promotion.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


ls|ecwh|

up|2|hs|ec|nt|
Do you suppose that East can have the last laugh if he overtakes his partner's @CJ at trick 1? |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


ls|ec|pc|ck|hs|sh|at|South must ruff as a second round of clubs from East would end things quickly.|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


ls|sh|pc|h|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


hs|sh|nt|South can still get home, but he must be careful. He should start by cashing a high trump in his hand (other play sequences also work on the given lie of the cards).|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


ls|sh|pc|ha|pc|h|pc|h|pc|c|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


hs|ss|nt|
The top spades are cashed next |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


ls|ss|pc|sa|pc|s|pc|s|pc|s|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


pc|sk|pc|s|pc|s|pc|c|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


hs|ssnh|at|and a spade is ruffed in the dummy.|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


ls|nhss|pc|s|pc|s|pc|h|pc|c|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


hs|ncec|nt|A club is led from dummy, forcing East to cover (or South would pitch his diamond).  |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


ls|ecnc|pc|cq|pc|ca|hs|shwh|at|South must be careful to ruff high, intentionally promoting a trump trick for West.|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


ls|shwh|pc|hk|pc|d|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


hs|ssnh|nt|South ruffs another spade in dummy, establishing the suit. |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


ls|ssnh|pc|s|pc|s|pc|h|pc|c|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


hs|ncsd|nt|
Now North's club winner can be cashed for a diamond discard (cashing the @HQ first is also fine). |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


ls|ncsd|pc|c|pc|c|pc|d|hs|wh|at|West is welcome to ruff this trick.|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


ls|wh|pc|h|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


mc|12|nt|That will be the only trick for the defense, however.

So if you play correctly you can always make 6@H on this deal. Did you disappoint your partner?|
