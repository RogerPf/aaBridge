^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 360 - August 4, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
|cs|4|at|^-{ ^*BSPECIAL!!!! There are 2 Deals of the Week this week!^*N }
^-
Both deals were played by ^*BWang Jianping^*N, a self-described amateurish player from Wuhon, in Hubei Province, China. The 2 deals this week share a common theme. In each deal Wang played well as the declarer, but was foiled by sensational defense.

I am pleased to announce that from August 18 to 28, ^*Blive^*N vugraph of the ^*BWorld Junior Championships^*N will be presented through ^*BBridge Base Online^*N. Expert commentary and analysis will be provided in several languages. When we know the session starting times we will post them on the following web page:

sk|s|nt|I like the way that Wang described the setting for this week's second deal: "Here is a deal I played against ^*BMasood Salim^*N (^*BZia Mahmood's^*N Pakistani partner - an old and kind gentleman and the greatest player I have met in my life) in 1997 when I was working in Karachi, Pakistan".|
