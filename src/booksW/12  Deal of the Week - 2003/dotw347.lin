The Cavendish is not only the strongest invitational tournament in the world, it also offers far more prize money than any other bridge event. Every year dozens of top partnerships from all over the world come to the Cavendish to compete for over $1 million in prize money. The result of this equation is that the bridge in the Cavendish is always both exciting and of the highest standard. 

This week's deal was played in the 2001 Cavendish Teams.

sk|s|hs|sh|nt|In this week's deal France's ^*BPaul Chemla^*N became the declarer in 4@H after West, ^*BSteve Garner^*N of the United States, had made a weak jump overcall of 2@S over Chemla's 1@H opening bid. Chemla was playing with ^*BAlain Levy^*N and Garner was playing with ^*BHoward Weinstein^*N when this week's deal was played. |

Garner selected the @CJ as his opening lead. Think about how you would play this hand as the declarer before reading on. |

nt|Not to take anything away from the fine defense that Weinstein and Garner put up, but for Chemla (who happens to love cigars) this deal was a case of "close, but no cigar". Instead of leading a diamond to the 10th trick, a ruffing finesse against Weinstein's @CQ would have seen Chemla home. It was a most uncharacteristic error for Paul Chelma to miss the winning play.|
