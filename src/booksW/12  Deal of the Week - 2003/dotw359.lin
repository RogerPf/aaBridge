^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 359 - July 28, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played by my partner, ^*BBrad Moss^*N, during our round-of-32 match during the recent ^*BSpingold Knockout Teams^*N at the ACBL's Summer North American Championships in Long Beach, California. I wish I had some bridge triumphs to report from this tournament, but unfortunately my results were dismal.

Oh well - at least I enjoyed being the dummy when this week's deal was played...

The only good news I have from Long Beach is on the vugraph front. We set another record for attendance during our live broadcast of the Spingold Final as close to 1800 were logged on to ^*BBridge Base Online^*N (^*BBBO^*N) during this show. Also, for the first time ever at an ACBL Nationals, the ^*BBBO^*N software itself was used to present vugraph to a live audience at the playing site.

hs|nd|at|West's opening lead was a 4th best @D3. Brad tried the @D10 from the dummy |

ls|nd|pc|DT|pc|D8|pc|D4|at|which won the trick as East followed with the @D8 - a count signal suggesting that he was dealt an even number of diamonds. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|It appeared that West had started with 5 diamonds headed by the @DQ. Think about how you would play as the declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


hs|nd|Hs|sd|nt|West's diamond lead, by attacking dummy's entries, |

ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|ns|hs|ss|at|had effectively neutralized spades as a source of tricks for Brad. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|hs|nh|hs|sh|at|He therefore turned his attention to hearts and finessed the @H10 at trick 2. |

hs|sh|at|As the @HK easily might have been a falsecard, Brad probed the distribution of the hearts by cashing the @HQ. |

ls|sh|
pc|HQ|pc|H7|pc|H8|pc|S5|at|East discarded the @S5 on this trick. How would you continue as the declarer from here? |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


hc|dacak|nt|Brad had won 4 tricks already, but he had only 3 more winners in top cards (the @DA, @CA, and @CK). |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |

hs|sh|hs|sd|at|It might be possible to eventually throw West on lead in hearts, endplaying him to lead diamonds, but his 4 black suit cards would have to be removed first. Furthermore, an endplay against West would provide only trick 8 for Brad - where was trick 9 going to come from?|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


ls|sh|ls|sd|hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|Spades was the most obvious source for another winner, but the fact that West was long in both red suits suggested that East rated to be long in spades. That did not bode well for Brad trying to establish a trick in the spade suit. Still, Brad had a good reason for leading the @SJ to the next trick. Can you see what he was up to?|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|
pc|SJ|pc|S3|hs|ns|nt|West produced the @S3 and Brad called for a small spade from the dummy. |

sk||hs|ec|Hs|es|at|but Brad knew that East was out of red cards and he hoped that East's forced black suit return would give up a trick. |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


ls|es|hs|nc|At|That is exactly what happened when East chose to return a club which Brad ducked around to the dummy's @CJ. |

hs|es|hs|ns|nt|At the point where East led a club away from his @CQ, it would not have helped him to lead a low spade instead. In that variation, Brad would have won in the dummy |

ls|nc|up|12|nt|In the above position that Brad reached, East was endplayed. His actual choice of exiting in clubs allowed Brad to endplay West later in the play. |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


ls|ec|hs|Es|at|If East had exited in spades instead of clubs, there still would have been a second endplay, but in that case East would have been endplayed a 2nd time (instead of each of the defenders being endplayed once). |
