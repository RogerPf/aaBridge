^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 350 - May 26, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
I was the declarer when this week's deal was played on ^*BBridge Base Online^*N (^*BBBO^*N) and about 100 people were watching. Apparently a lot of these people were impressed with the technique that I used to make my contract as I received several e-mails and dozens of chat messages praising my play. I guess none of these people realized that I actually misplayed this hand! See if you can spot the mistakes that I made.

When this week's deal was played my partner was ^*BBrad Moss^*N and my opponents were ^*BRichard Pavlicek^*N and ^*BRoger Bates^*N. The 4 of us along with ^*BRuss Ekeblad^*N and ^*BRon Rubin^*N (our captain) will be playing in the ^*BUnited States Bridge Championships^*N in Memphis next week. If we happen to win this tournament (much easier said than done) then we will go on to represent the United States in the 2003 ^*BBermuda Bowl^*N World Championships.

It is not certain yet, but there is a good chance that the semi-finals and finals of the United States Bridge Championships will be broadcast ^*Blive^*N through ^*BBBO^*N. It is certain that the finals and semi-finals of the ^*BCanadian National Teams Championships^*N (which also takes place in early June) will be broadcast live through ^*BBBO^*N. Session starting times will be posted on the following web page. You can click the blue rectangle below to go to this web page in a new browser window:

When this week's deal was played, before I had a chance to count all my points, Brad and Richard had already passed....|

mb|p|mb|2S|an|8-11 Balanced|
at|Brad responded 2@S. In our system 2@S is an artificial bid that describes a balanced hand with 8-11 HCP. The reason we use this convention is we have found it to be helpful for the responder to be able to get a mild slam try off his (or her) chest immediately. This invention seems to work (famous last words).|

ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|nd|at|I am not sure what inspired Brad to treat his @DQ107 as a 4-card suit |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


ls|nd|hs|nc|hs|sc|at|or to play in 6NT rather than 6@C (a tough decision). Likely Brad and I will be doing some talking about these 2NT-4NT auctions...|

ls|nc|ls|sc|nt|
In any case, here I was in 6NT. Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on. |

nt|I am capable of getting all of that at the table. I am also capable of coming up with rough estimates of probabilities for the various relevant cases. These estimates really have to be rough because they are dependent probabilities (that is, the knowledge that hearts were 4-2 and diamonds were 2-5 comes into play). Dependent probabilities are beyond my brain's computing power!|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|Sc|nt|At the actual online bridge table, I didn't want to sit there and think about this problem for a long time so I just went with what felt right (finessing the @CJ). Subsequent analysis suggests that this was not the technically correct play. Playing the @CA on the second round of the suit is clearly superior to my play of finessing the @CJ.|

hs|ns|Hs|ss|hs|ws|nt|Retaining all 3 of dummy's spades pays off on this layout because this leaves the option of playing the @SA followed by another spade. Given that West will be known to be long in spades when the play goes this way, playing on spades in the endgame |

ls|sc|hs|sh|at|I could later discard a club from the dummy on the fourth round of hearts in order to keep as many options open as possible. |

at|If Richard had a diamond winner in the end game, my decision would be different (not that this could have mattered on the actual layout). Getting into this kind of mind game with ^*BRichard Pavlicek^*N might be fun, but I wouldn't like my chances!|
