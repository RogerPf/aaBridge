^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 343 - April 7, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
Norway's ^*BGeir Helgemo^*N is widely considered to be one of the world's best players and his brilliant exploits as declarer have appeared several times over the years in this feature. This week's deal is another Helgemo masterpiece. Geir was playing in a practice match with ^*BJimmy Cayne^*N (who has been winning major ACBL events for over 30 years) when this week's deal was played.

I would like to thank my friend ^*BGeo Tislevoll^*N for bringing this deal to my attention. Geo is another one of Norway's top players and he is also a gifted writer who has taken a special interest in Geir Helgemo's remarkable bridge talents. Geo is the author of the book, ^*IHelgemo's World of Bridge^*N.

This book contains dozens of beautiful deals that Geir was involved in, but it also contains Geo's personal observations about Geir himself. Geo and Geir began their friendship when Geir was only 12 years old and just starting out as a bridge player. For the past 20 years Geo has watched Geir grow into the champion and man that he has become today. In ^*IHelgemo's World of Bridge^*N Geo is thus able to offer a unique perspective on the talents and character of one of the greatest bridge players of our time.

I am confident that regular readers of ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N will enjoy reading ^*IHelgemo's World of Bridge^*N (published by ^*BFive Aces Books^*N and available through major bridge supply houses).

If Geo ever writes a sequel to ^*IHelgemo's World of Bridge^*N, you can bet that this week's deal will be included in it (you can also bet that I will buy such a book)!

I am pleased to announce the release of ^*ILearn to Play Bridge 2^*N, the latest computer program that I have developed. This program is available as a ^*Bfree^*N download through the web site of the ^*BAmerican Contract Bridge League^*N (ACBL). You can click on the yellow rectangle below to be taken to this web site in a new browser window.

The original ^*ILearn to Play Bridge^*N program was released in 1999 and it was also offered for free through the ACBL's web site. Over 250,000 people have downloaded this program and I have received a great deal of positive feedback from people who have used this program to either learn to play bridge or to brush up on their skills.

While both of these programs are available as free downloads, their development was quite expensive. Both programs contain the equivalent of about 500 pages of material and I spent 6 months of (very) full time work developing each of these programs. I am grateful to the ACBL and the ^*BACBL Education Foundation^*N for financing these projects in the hope of increasing the number of bridge players out there. My special thanks goes out to ^*BJulie Greenberg^*N and ^*BBetty Starzec^*N of the ACBL's Educational Department for the help and support they gave me while I worked on these programs.

The ACBL receives a lot of criticism these days, but they deserve nothing but praise for their involvement in this project. If you have a friend who wants to learn to play bridge or is an intermediate player who is eager to improve, please tell him or her about ^*ILearn to Play Bridge^*N and ^*ILearn to Play Bridge 2^*N!

hs|nd|hs|wd|at|Geir would be left with several winning options. He could, for example, duck a diamond to West's now singleton @DK, |

ls|ws|ls|nd|pc|S9|pc|DA|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|sh|hs|ws|at|Geir demonstrated that West's spade discard was not as safe as it had looked. He ruffed a spade with his last trump to remove West's remaining card in that suit |

up|24|hs|sh|nt|Not to take anything away from Geir's brilliant play of this deal, but it should be noted that, at the point when he ducked the first round of diamonds, he also could have succeeded by ruffing a spade with his last trump. |
