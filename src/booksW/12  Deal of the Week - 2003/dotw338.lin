Too bad this is the 338th ^*BDeal of the Week^*N - if it had been the 333rd, that would have been something really special!

This week's deal was played last Saturday by ^*BMorten Andersen^*N in the semi-finals of the ^*BDanish Teams Championship^*N. Morten was playing with ^*BSøren Christiansen^*N when this week's deal was played. The deal has been rotated to make South the declarer.

The entire semi-finals and finals of this event were broadcast live through ^*BBridge Base Online^*N. These broadcasts represented 2 significant firsts for our site. First, we were broadcasting live from all of the tables in play (up to 4 at a time) simultaneously. We have never broadcast more than one table at a time before. Second, the event resulted in a new record for attendance on our site. There were over 1200 people logged in at one point. The previous record was slightly over 900.

I would like to thank the ^*BDanish Bridge Federation^*N for their support of this production and ^*BThorvald Aagaard^*N (who was also playing in the event) for his iniative and hard work organizing the broadcasts and training the operators.

If you are involved in running a bridge tournament that you would like to see broadcast live through ^*BBridge Base Online^*N, please e-mail me (^*Bfred@@bridgebase.com^*N) for more information.

Another recent milestone for our company is that we had over 2 million hits on our web site for both January and February. We now average over 70,000 hits per day. It doesn't seem that long ago that I remember excitedly announcing having 5,000 hits in one day.

Finally, I am pleased to announce that for the first time in our 12 year history, we are lowering the price on one of our educational products (we have never raised a price before either). The product is called ^*BConventions^*N and it based on material written by ^*BMike Lawrence^*N, one of the most popular bridge authors in the world today.

^*BConventions^*N was released about 4 years ago at a price of $59.95. The price has now been dropped to $39.95. The program contains detailed descriptions of dozens of popular conventions along with hundreds of example hands and quizzes. This product is sub-titled ^*Iand the judgment to make them work^*N and this important philosophy is an integral part of Mike Lawrence's writing.

Click on the yellow rectangle below to learn more about and/or order ^*BConventions^*N (as well as various other educational software products that were created by ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N). Clicking either of the colored rectangles will open a new browser window on your computer.

pg| ***** 45 ***** |


ls|sh|up|16|hs|nd|nt|On this deal there were a couple of instructive points for the defense. One of these came when Morten led the @D10 off the dummy. |

pg| ***** 49 ***** |


ls|wh|md|0,hj,,hk|hs|eh|nt|I strongly suspect that Morten would not have allowed himself to fall into this trap. If East had been dealt the @HK then he would not have let the lead remain in the dummy - he would have covered the @D10 with the @DJ to ensure the defeat of the contract. |
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|sh|ls|nh|md|0,hk,,hj|up|23|at|The defense had only one legitimate chance to defeat 3NT on this deal. Do you know what that was?|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


hs|ec|nt|In order to defeat Morten's contract, East had to retain his @C9 at trick 1! When he chose to signal with that card there was no longer any way that the defense could prevail. If East had kept the @C9 (and if the defenders had played perfectly after that), eventually he could have gained the lead with that card thereby preventing his partner from being endplayed. Watch...|
