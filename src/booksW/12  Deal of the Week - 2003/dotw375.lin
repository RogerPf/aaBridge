^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 375 - November 17, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
This week's deal won the ^*BInternational Bridge Press Association's^*N 2003 award for ^*BBest Defense of the Year^*N. ^*BLarry Cohen^*N and ^*BAlan Truscott^*N won this award for their writeup of a sensational defense by American star ^*BEric Greco^*N.

The ^*B2003 World Bridge Championships^*N have just finished. Congratulations to the United States for winning most of the top honors! You can find out more about this tournament through:

Every session of these championships was broadcast ^*Blive^*N from Monte Carlo through ^*BBridge Base Online^*N (^*BBBO^*N). Whoever wrote the script for this tournament did a great job as far as online vugraph was concerned. The fate of the ^*BBermuda Bowl^*N final match between eternal rivals USA and Italy came down to the last board. It was still early in the morning in most of the United States, but there were still over 5400 people logged into ^*BBBO^*N (mostly to watch vugraph).

During the past 2 weeks, 67 expert players from all over the world have provided vugraph analysis on ^*BBBO^*N in 9 languages. Thanks to all of them and to ^*BRoland Wald^*N who scheduled and organized our commentators. Special thanks also to ^*BBénédicte Cronier^*N and ^*BHerve Lustman^*N who made it possible for us to broadcast this event in the first place. They, along with ^*BHenri Schweitzer^*N and ^*BAlfredo Conterno^*N, also did a fantastic job as vugraph operators in Monte Carlo. All of these good people were unpaid volunteers.

st||sk|w|nt|When this week's deal was played, ^*BEric Greco^*N was playing with his regular partner, ^*BGeoff Hampson^*N. Eric, West, was on opening lead against 3NT after the declarer had opened 1@D, raised his partner's 2@C response to 3@C, and bid 3NT over his partner's 3@S rebid. |
