^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 352 - June 9, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
Sometimes life and bridge can be unfair. Take Norway for example. Norway is a small country that just happened to produce the greatest bridge talent of modern times in ^*BGeir Helgemo^*N. I am sure that Norway is a lovely country and that Norwegians fully deserve to have a bridge superstar, but now it looks like they are going to have another one - ^*BBoye Brogeland^*N. That's not fair!

Boye seems to have all of the same qualities that have made Geir such a force in bridge. They are both fearless in the bidding and brilliant in the card play and they both possess perfect temperaments at the table. Boye was the declarer in this week's deal. His partner was English star ^*BTony Forrester^*N when this week's deal was played.

The last 4 segments of the Finals of the ^*BUnited States Bridge Championships^*N will be broadcast live today through ^*BBridge Base Online^*N. Today will also be the first of 3 days in which the ^*BCanadian National Teams Championships^*N will be broadcast as live vugraph through our site. Approximate session starting times can be found on the following web page:

Think about how you would continue as declarer before reading on. |

pg| ***** 17 ***** |


ls|sh|pc|H9|pc|H8|hs|nh|at|who followed small. |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


hs|nh|at|Boye played small from the dummy, not minding if East was able to win the trick with the @HQ (as East had no quick way to get to his partner's spades). |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


ls|nh|pc|H2|pc|H3|nt|East actually played a low heart to this trick, but it took him a while to make this play. |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


hs|eh|sk||at|Boye correctly concluded that East had made the fine play of ducking his @HQ from an original holding of @HQxxx. |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


ls|eh|hs|wd|at|Furthermore, he assumed that West had started with 4 diamonds or else there would be no problem. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


ls|wd|at|Can you see how Boye was able to come to 5 more tricks from here?|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


hs|sh|nt|Boye continued with the counter-intuitive (to me at least) play of leading the @H10 out of his hand. If he had led the @HK at this point he would not have been able to make his contract against best defense. |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


ls|sh|pc|ht|hs|ws|at|West discarded a spade on this trick |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


ls|ws|pc|S3|hs|nh|at|and, when Boye played low from the dummy, |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


ls|nh|pc|H4|hs|eh|at|East continued his good work by ducking his @HQ again. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


ls|eh|pc|H5|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


hs|wd|hs|sd|nt|Boye then cashed the @DQ to clarify the position in that suit. |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


ls|sd|ls|Wd|pc|DQ|pc|D8|hs|nh|at|He discarded a heart from the dummy |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


ls|nh|pc|H7|hs|ec|at|and East pitched a club, |

pg| ***** 34 ***** |


ls|sh|pc|hk|hs|ws|Hs|wd|hs|wc|at|West was caught in a strange 3-suit squeeze. |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


ls|ws|ls|wc|nt|A diamond discard was obviously unthinkable |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


ls|wd|hs|ws|at|and, if West had discarded a spade, |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


ls|ws|pc|s7|pc|hj|pc|h6|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


hs|wd|hs|sd|at|Boye would be able to safely surrender a diamond trick to West. |

pg| ***** 42 ***** |


hs|sd|hs|sc|mc|9|at|but then Boye would win the last 2 tricks with the @CA and a long diamond. |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


ls|sd|ls|sc|up|11|hs|wc|nt|West therefore discarded a club on the 3rd round of hearts. |

mc|9|hs|sd|hs|ws|Hs|Sd|at|and West was thus able to win the last 2 tricks to hold Boye to his contract. Nice defense by East for sure, but ^*BBoye Brogeland^*N deserves special credit for his fantastic play on this deal! Trust me on this - you are going to be hearing more and more of that name.|
