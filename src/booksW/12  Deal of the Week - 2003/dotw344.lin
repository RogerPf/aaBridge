^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 344 - April 14, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }

^*BBridge Base Online^*B (^*BBBO^*N), the ^*Bfree^*N online bridge service that was developed by my company, continues to grow at a rapid pace. As I type this there are close to 1000 people logged in to our site. Sundays are always a good day, but nowadays there are always more than 900 people logged in at the peak time of each day.

My friend ^*BUday Ivatury^*N and I are currently working hard to implement duplicate tournaments on ^*BBBO^*N. It is not clear when the programming and testing of this facility will be complete, but the development process is going very well. I am hopeful that we will be able to run our first duplicate tournament within a month and that the growth rate of ^*BBBO^*N will continue to accelerate once tounaments are available through this site.

One of the reasons that ^*BBBO^*N is getting more and more popular is that a lot of famous players have become regulars on this site. It is almost always possible to log in and kibitz at a table where various world class players are playing. 

This week's deal was played at such a table. All 4 of the players were famous experts. I have decided to leave their names out because, although the declarer played most of his cards with great skill, he did make a clear error at one point in the play. See if you can spot the mistake that was made.

at|West overcalled with a preemptive 3@H and, after North made a negative double, East raised to 4@H. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


hs|ss|at|South bid 4@S which became the final contract. |

pg| ***** 4 ***** |


ls|ss|pc|H4|nt|West (a disciplined bidder who was certain to hold a 7-card suit for her 3@H overcall) selected the @H4 as her opening lead. Hmmmm.... that's a strange looking heart. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


pc|H5|pc|HA|pc|H6|at|East won the first trick with the @HA |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


pc|HT|hs|ns|at|and, after great thought, returned the @H10 which the declarer ruffed in dummy. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


ls|ns|pc|H2|pc|H3|pc|S3|at|Think about how you would play this hand as declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


hs|nc|Hs|sc|nt|The actual declarer got off to a good start by leading the @C9 from the dummy and passing it. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|pc|C9|pc|C2|pc|C3|pc|S5|at|He was not surprised when West ruffed (the strange heart she led suggested that something unusual was going on). |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


pc|H8|hs|ns|hs|sd|at|West chose to lead back a third round of hearts, further threatening the declarer's trump control. Declarer ruffed in the dummy and discarded a diamond from his hand. |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|sd|pc|S9|pc|H7|pc|D5|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


hs|ns|nt|The declarer continued by cashing the @SK |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


ls|ns|pc|SK|pc|S4|pc|S2|pc|S7|at|(both defenders followed small). |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|at|A diamond to the South hand |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|pc|D4|pc|D2|pc|DA|pc|D3|at|also produced small cards from both defenders. |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


hs|ss|hs|nc|at|The declarer cashed the @SA next and discarded a club from the dummy. |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


ls|ss|ls|nc|pc|SA|pc|S6|pc|C5|pc|SJ|at|East followed with the @SJ. |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


at|How would you continue to play as declarer from here? |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


sk||hs|ws|nt|You can now see the remaining East-West cards. The @SQ was the only outstanding trump, but the declarer did not know which defender had been dealt that card. |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


ls|ws|hs|sc|at|He still did not know after the next trick when he made the fine play of leading the @CA |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


ls|sc|pc|CA|hs|wh|at|and West declined to ruff. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


ls|wh|pc|H9|pc|C8|pc|C7|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


hs|ss|hs|Ws|hs|nd|at|South then exited in spades and West won the @SQ as a diamond was discarded from the dummy. |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|ss|ls|ws|pc|S8|pc|SQ|pc|D8|pc|C6|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


hs|nd|Hs|sd|Hs|wd|Hs|ed|nt|If West had returned a diamond then the declarer's task would have been easy. As you can see, it was always possible for the declarer to play the diamond suit himself without losing a trick, but doing so would involve guessing. The declarer was now in a position where it was not necessary for him to guess anything. |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


ls|wd|ls|nd|ls|ed|ls|sd|hs|wh|nt|Of course West found the best defense of leading back yet another heart. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


ls|wh|pc|Hk|hs|nd|at|A diamond was pitched from the dummy |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


ls|nd|pc|D9|hs|nc|hs|ec|at|and East, who had to retain her club guard, |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


ls|ec|ls|nc|hs|ed|at|was squeezed down to a singleton diamond. |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


ls|ed|pc|D7|hs|ss|at|South ruffed to win the trick |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


ls|ss|pc|ST|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


hs|sd|hs|wd|Hs|ed|mc|10|at|and claimed the balance (he had a complete count on the hand and he knew that the diamonds would run). |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


ls|wd|ls|ed|ls|sd|nt|While the declarer certainly deserves some credit for making his contract without having to guess the diamonds, the line of play that he chose left some room for improvement. Did you spot the mistake that the declarer made? |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


up|8|hs|ss|hs|ws|nt|The mistake came at the point where the declarer played a spade to West's @SQ. |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


hs|sd|ls|ss|ls|ws|at|He should have cashed his remaining high diamond |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


ls|sd|pc|dk|pc|dt|pc|d8|pc|d7|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


hs|ss|hs|ws|at|before exiting in spades. |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


ls|ws|ls|ss|pc|s8|pc|sq|pc|d9|pc|c4|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


hs|wh|at|On the actual layout, West would have been forced to return a heart |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


ls|wh|pc|hq|pc|dj|hs|ed|Hs|ec|at|and East would have been squeezed as before. |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


ls|ed|ls|ec|up|10|md|0,dq,,sq|hs|es|Hs|wd|nt|The recommended play of cashing a second round of diamonds before leading the third round of spades gains on this layout (where East has the remaining trump and West was dealt the guarded @DQ). |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


ls|es|ls|wd|hs|sd|hs|ed|at|Here the @DK strips East's last safe exit card |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


ls|sd|ls|Ed|pc|dk|pc|dt|pc|d8|pc|d7|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


hs|ss|hs|es|at|and then a spade to East's @SQ |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


ls|ss|ls|es|pc|s8|pc|hj|pc|d9|pc|sq|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


hs|ec|Hs|nc|at|would force her to lead away from the @CQ. |mc|10|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


ls|ec|ls|nc|up|8|hs|ss|hs|es|nt|If the East-West cards had been distributed as above, then the declarer's actual line would have failed. East would have won the third round of spades with the @SQ |
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


ls|es|ls|ss|pc|s8|pc|hj|pc|d8|pc|sq|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


hs|ed|at|and got out of her own way by leading a diamond. |
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


ls|ed|pc|D7|hs|wd|Hs|nd|hs|sd|At|There would be no way for the declarer to avoid a diamond loser now and his contract would have failed. |mc|9|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


ls|wd|ls|nd|up|9|md|0,dq,,sq|

nt|Cashing the @DK in the above position actually guarantees the contract on the assumption that West was dealt a 7-card heart suit. There is no possible disribution in which one of the defenders was dealt both the @SQ and 3 diamonds to the @DQ. West would have to be 4730 (14 cards) or 3720 (12 cards) for the recommended play to cost. That makes it a pretty good play!|
