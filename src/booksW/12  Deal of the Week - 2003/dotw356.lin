^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 356 - July 7, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played by ^*BWayne Burrows^*N during a recent tournament on ^*BBridge Base Online^*N (^*BBBO^*N). The deal has been rotated to make South the declarer. Wayne, a strong player from New Zealand who uses the name ^*BCascade^*N on ^*BBBO^*N, has contributed greatly to the ^*BBBO^*N community through his volunteer work as an online teacher and director. Wayne has recently become a "Yellow person" on ^*BBBO^*N. We have several Yellow people from all over the world on our site and their mission is to help new players and to keep the atmosphere pleasant.

The latest version of the ^*BBBO^*N software makes it easy for members to set up team matches and tournaments. Both of these new features have been very popular and, like everything else on ^*BBBO^*N, access to team matches and tournaments is 100% free.

Every day there are over 100,000 log ins to our site. At peak times there are often more than 1400 people logged in and over 250 tables in play. Many of the world's best players are now playing and studying bridge through ^*BBBO^*N.

Besides the ability to play various forms of online bridge, ^*BBBO^*N offers educational and training facilities that are not available on any other online bridge site. Our live vugraph broadcasts of major tournaments are very popular. Join the 1000s of bridge players who are switching to ^*BBBO^*N by downloading our ^*Bfree^*n software through the following web page:
