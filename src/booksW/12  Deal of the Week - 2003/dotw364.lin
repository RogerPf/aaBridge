^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 364 - September 1, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played in the 13th round robin match of the recent ^*BWorld Youth Team Championships^*N. This deal has been rotated to make South the declarer. Since a good case can be made that this deal was both misplayed and misdefended, I have left out the names of the players that were involved. Congratulations to all of the teams that won medals in this event (Italy won the Gold, Denmark won the Silver, and USA 2 won the Bronze)!

The 64-board Semi-Final between Italy and the USA was arguably one of the most remarkable matches in the history of bridge. Italy led by over 100 IMPs at a point in which the match was more than half over, but the USA staged an incredible comeback which fell short by only half an IMP (half IMPs are possible due to carryover). All of the deals of this match, including 2 possible grand slams in the last 2 boards, were broadcast ^*Blive^*N through ^*BBridge Base Online^*N (^*BBBO^*N). The finish was so dramatic and exciting that anyone who was watching was left with no doubt that bridge could indeed be a spectator sport.

Our vugraph broadcasts of this event were a huge success. There were many commentators and operators who contributed greatly to this, but 4 people in particular deserve to be mentioned. ^*BBBO^*N members ^*BRoland Wald^*N (^*Bwalddk^*N), Bénédicte Cronier (^*Bpatapon^*N), and ^*BHervé Lustman^*N (^*BZmud99^*N) were instrumental in organizing these broadcasts (and they also acted as commentators and/or operators). Also, ^*BJosé Damiani^*N, the President of the ^*BWorld Bridge Federation^*N (^*BWBF^*N), provided great support for our presentations. Last but not least, the ^*BFrench Bridge Federation^*N (^*BFFB^*N) should be mentioned as they provided us with both computers and technical support.

nt|In this week's deal imagine that you are the dealer with both sides vulnerable. You pass as does West and your partner and East opens the bidding with 1@C. |
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|
at|Suppose that you pass again. West responds 1@H and your partner comes in with a takeout double. |
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


mb|2H|mb|?|an|Promises 4 hearts|at|East raises to 2@H, promising 4-card support. What call do you think that the player holding your cards made at the table? |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call was made when this deal was played?^^4s|hs|ss|mb|4S|an|Nice bid!|
nt|At the table, the actual South player chose to jump to 4@S, even though he and his partner were both passed hands! 4@S was a great bid in my view. Everything about this hand is golden - 5 cards in one of the suits that partner showed, |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


ls|ss|hs|sd|at|some useful honors in partner's other suit, |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


ls|sd|hs|sh|at|no wasted values opposite partner's known heart shortness, |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


ls|sh|hs|sc|at|and a guarantee of at most one loser in clubs. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


ls|sc|hc|sqdqjckq|nt|The 4@S bid that was made is an excellent example of the limitations of relying strictly upon point count for hand evaluation. Many of the bidding decisions that experts make are based on visualizing partner's (and sometimes the opponents') possible hands and visualizing how the play might go. This particular South visualized that 4@S would usually be a good contract.

pg| ***** 22 ***** |


hc|s9|nt|The actual declarer continued with the unusual play of leading the @S9 from the dummy. |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


lc|s9|pc|s9|pc|s8|hs|ss|at|When East followed small, he played low from his hand, |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


ls|ss|pc|s3|pc|sK|at|and West won the trick with the @SK. |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


sk||hs|wh|hs|ws|at|You can now see the rest of the East-West cards. In order to defeat the contract, West had to lead either a spade or a heart at this point. |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


ls|wh|hs|ns|nt|For the sake of argument, let's follow the rest of the play after a spade return to dummy's @SA. |

pg| ***** 28 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|hs|wd|hs|ed|nt|
The declarer's only chance from here would be to cash the @DA in the hope that the @D10 was doubleton. On the actual layout of the East-West cards, his contract would have failed. |mc|9|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|ls|wd|ls|ed|up|4|hs|wd|hs|sd|nt|At the table West chose to play the declarer for 4432 distribution. He returned a diamond in the hope of giving his partner a ruff. On the actual deal, the declarer (who really was 5422) was able to win the trick in his hand, |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |

hs|nd|hs|sh|at|and discard his remaining hearts on dummy's diamond winners. |mc|10|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sh|up|12|hc|s9|
nt|So, the way the play actually went, the defense had a chance to defeat 4@S, but they failed to take advantage. There are several ways that the declarer could have played from the point at which he led the @S9 from the dummy that would have left the defense no chance. I found some of the possible sequences to be interesting (which is why you are reading about this deal!).|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


hs|wh|hs|eh|lc|s9|nt|Before we get involved in what could have happened from here, consider what information the declarer had about the deal at this critical point in the play. It was likely that East still had the @HA, because West would have led a top honor if he had been dealt both the @HA and @HK and East would have led the @HK, not the @HQ, at trick 2 if his hearts were headed by the @HKQJ.|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|wh|hs|ec|hs|wc|nt|Declarer also knew that East started with 5 clubs to the @CA (or @CAJ) and the @DK. |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


ls|ec|ls|wc|hs|es|hs|ws|at|Therefore, It was likely that the spades were 2-2 (with East starting with 2425 distribution) and that West had been dealt the @SK (because if East had either a singleton spade or the @SK, he would have rebid 3@H instead of 2@H). |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt|I believe that the actual declarer drew these inferences about the likely 2-2 spade division and position of the @SK. However, it would appear that he had a blind spot that made him think that he needed both the @SJ to be on his right and the @D10 to be doubleton in order to have a chance to make his contract from the position that he reached. |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


ls|es|ls|ws|hs|nd|hs|sd|nt|Suppose that instead of leading the @S9 off the dummy, the declarer had crossed to his hand in diamonds. |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|dj|pc|d4|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|at|He could then cross back to the @SA (ruffing a heart also works) |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|sa|pc|s8|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


hs|nd|at|and lead the @DA from the dummy. |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


ls|nd|pc|da|hs|es|hs|ss|at|East must ruff and declarer overruffs. |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


ls|es|ls|ss|pc|sj|pc|sq|pc|dt|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


hs|sh|hs|ns|at|A heart is ruffed with dummy's @S9 |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


ls|sh|ls|ns|pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|s9|pc|h3|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sh|hs|ws|at|and declarer's last heart loser is discarded on a diamond as West ruffs with his @SK.|mc|10|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sh|ls|Ws|up|16|hs|nc|hs|ss|nt|Ruffing a club in the closed hand at the critical point would lead to the same successful ending for the declarer. |
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|ss|hs|nd|hs|sd|at|What is really strange (to me at least) is that this ending is so strong for South that, instead of unblocking the diamonds, he can afford to "eat his own children" by cashing the @DA! I am not suggesting this is a good play, just that it is a cool play!|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|pc|da|pc|d3|pc|dj|pc|d4|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


hs|nd|Hs|ss|hs|eh|nt|The declarer must then continue by ruffing a diamond. Assume that East discards a heart, as good as anything. |
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|nd|ls|ss|pc|d6|pc|h3|pc|s3|pc|dt|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


hs|sh|hs|ns|at|South must then ruff a heart in dummy (a spade to the @SA does not work in this variation) |
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


ls|sh|ls|ns|pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|s9|pc|ha|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


hs|nd|at|to play a winning diamond. |
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


ls|nd|pc|d9|hs|es|hs|ws|mc|10|nt|Regardless of which defender ruffs in (or if neither of them ruff), the declarer will be OK. The remaining position is not especially complicated and I am sure you can figure out the few possible variations from this point.|
