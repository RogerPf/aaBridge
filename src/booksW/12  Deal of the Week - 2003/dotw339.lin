^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 339 - March 10, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }

|cs|4|At|^-{ ^*BSPECIAL!!! There are 2 Deals of the Week this week!^*N }
^-
Last week I received an e-mail, "Please write about more deals containing x" (where x is some type of bridge problem or technique).

I just finished playing in the ^*BNational Open Pairs^*N in Philadelphia, the scene of the ^*BACBL Spring North American Championships^*N. My partner, ^*BBrad Moss^*N, and I finished somewhere between 30th and 40th - not good. The good news is that 2 hands containing x came up in the event. I am not going to tell you what x is because that would make it easier for you to solve these problems.

The semi-finals and finals of the ^*BValderbilt Cup^*N will be broadcast ^*Blive^*N through ^*BBridge Base Online^*N on March 14 and 15. When session starting times are known they will be posted at:

at|Brad, South, dealt and opened 1@H with both sides vulnerable. |
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


mb|1S|mb|D|mb|2S|mb|3H|
at|After Maks overcalled 1@S, I made a negative double, and Allan raised to 2@S, Brad made the unusual decision to rebid 3@H despite holding only 5 cards in that suit. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|I raised to 4@H which became the final contract. |mb|P|mb|4H|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|

pg| ***** 6 ***** |


pc|SK|pc|ST|pc|S7|pc|S5|at|Maks won the second trick with the @SK |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |

ls|sd|pc|D3|pc|D8|pc|DQ|at|as Allan followed with the @D8. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|Think about how you would continue as the declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sc|nt|Having lost 2 tricks already and with the @CA still outstanding, |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|nh|hs|sh|at|Brad would have to play the trump suit without loss in order to make his contract. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|hs|ss|at|He was always going to have to find a way to deal with his remaining spade loser. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


ls|ss|hs|nc|hs|sc|at|His first move was to drive out the @CA. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|
pc|C8|pc|CT|pc|CK|pc|CA|at|Allan won the next trick with that card as Maks followed with the @C10, suggesting he had an odd number of clubs. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


pc|SQ|hs|nh|nt|Allan continued with the strong defense of playing a third round of spades to force the dummy to ruff. |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


ls|nh|pc|S9|pc|S2|pc|H7|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sh|at|Brad was always planning on finessing Allan for the @HQ, but it appeared that he could no longer pick up a holding of 4 hearts to the @HQ in Allan's hand. To make matters worse, all indications were that Allan was dealt length in trumps.|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|Brad demonstrated that it was still possible to pick up @HQxxx in Allan's hand. He continued by passing the @HJ |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|pc|HJ|pc|H3|pc|H5|pc|H2|at|which held the trick. |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


hs|nc|at|Brad then cashed a high club |

ls|nc|
pc|CQ|pc|C6|pc|C4|pc|C3|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sh|at|and ruffed a club in his hand to shorten his trump holding down to Allan's expected trump length. |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sh|
pc|C2|pc|C9|pc|H9|pc|C7|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


hs|sh|at|Brad cashed a high heart from his hand |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


ls|sh|
pc|HA|pc|H8|pc|D6|pc|H4|at|as both defenders followed small. |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |

pg| ***** 28 ***** |


hs|nc|at|and played a winning club from the dummy. |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


ls|nc|pc|CJ|
hs|eh|sk||at|Here is the position that remained. As you can see, Brad had been correct in his assessment of the trump layout and his line of play had been necessary in order to make the contract. |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt|It would have been futile for Allan to ruff in here |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


ls|eh|hs|ed|at|so he discarded his last diamond. |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


ls|ed|pc|d4|hs|sd|at|Brad pitched his @DA |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


ls|sd|pc|DA|pc|S8|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|nd|hs|eh|hs|sh|at|and the lead remained in the dummy for the 12th trick. Brad was thereby able to pick up Allan's remaining @HQ6 through a ^*Btrump coup^*N to make his ambitious contract - well done partner! |mc|10|

nt|In this week's second deal Brad and I were playing against our friends and sometimes teammates ^*BMike Whitman^*N (North) and ^*BGrant Baze^*N (South). |

nt|When this went around to Brad he tried 3@C. |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


hs|sd|at|Grant took the push to 3@D, but Brad doubled for penalties. 3@D doubled was the final contract. |mb|P|mb|P|mb|3D|mb|D|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|

pg| ***** 43 ***** |


pc|D3|at|I returned the @D3. Think about how you would play as the declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


sk||hs|wd|at|Grant had been warned by Brad's double that trumps were breaking badly. It looked like Grant (who had lost a trick already) still had 3 certain trump loser and a sure loser in clubs. |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


hs|sd|nt|Watch how he managed to hold Brad to only 2 trump tricks. Grant ducked my trump return in his hand and Brad won the trick. |
pg| ***** 46 ***** |

pg| ***** 69 ***** |


up|43|nt|As you have no doubt figured out, the x that I was asked to write about in the recent e-mail that I received was ^*Btrump coups^*N. Perhaps Grant's play on this deal is more of a ^*Btrump endplay^*N than a ^*Btrump coup^*N, but whatever you call it, I call it a very nicely played hand! |
pg| ***** 70 ***** |
