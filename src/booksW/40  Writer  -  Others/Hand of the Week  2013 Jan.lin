West's 2H is a weak two-bid, showing a 6-card suit and around 5-9 points. Nowadays, players tend to open 1H when they hold 10 points and a fair 6-card major.|

mb|p|nt|^B@2
You have two tasks to perform when partner makes a take-out double. You must suggest a trump suit; you must also give some idea of the strength of your hand, so partner can assess the game prospects.|

NT||lb|*bPlease make a bid. Keep trying till you get the correct answer.^^4S|nt|^B@2
Let us look at your options.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|^B@2
Here you are very happy that spades become trumps. You would have to respond 2S even if you held just 1 or 2 points, so that would be a poorly judged response.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|^B@2
3S would be much better, but that is a non-forcing bid and you could easily miss a good game if partner passed.|

mb|P5Sp|nt||lb|*bPlease make a bid.^^6S|nt|^B@2
When the opponents have bid a suit a raise of the trump suit to the five-level (when trumps are one of the majors) carries a special meaning. It denies a contol in the opponents' suit and asks you to bid a slam if you hold one: Ace, King, singleton or void.|

Time to round up the wagons and assess the situation. In spades let us hope for no worse than 4-1 giving you one posssible loser. There are two heart losers, none in diamonds and one in clubs. That is a total of four possible losers and you can afford only one. For now let us win the opening lead in hand and decide he next move.|

nt||lb|*mWhich opponent for sure has singleton hearts?^East~West~I have no clue^1|nt|^B@2
That is a no brainer. West announced six hearts and you see six hearts between you and the dummy. Let us go to the next quiz.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT||lb|*mWhich opponent most like may have 4-card spades if there is a 4-1?^East~West~I have no clue^1|nt|^B@2
From the bidding and the fact that East has been silent throughout most likely he has the 4 spades if there would be such a break. But don't bet the barn on it. We will see soon.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


nt|^B@2
So it would be fair to play two round of trumps. But,|

NT||lb|*ydo you start trumps from your hand? ^^Y|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


^B@2
Of course. Low to Ace and the back to your hand is the best technique to gaurd against 4-1 break. Let us proceed.|

PC|S4S9SKH4|^B@2
You were correct all along. The crafty East has the 4-card spades and the singleton hearts. Also we know that West started with 1-6-??-??. WE can get more information by play a few rounds of diamonds.|

PC|DQDTH2H6|^B@2
Aha. So West started with 1-6-2-4 and east started with 4-1-4-4. The rest should be a piece of cake.|

Of course you play the @H3. BTW, it is not important what card East plays. he is entitled to one trick regardless.|

If you were watching some world championship and the declarer made 6S, following the line of play we have just seen, what would your reaction be? You would probably think, 'Well, that was quite easy.'  Easy for an top player, yes, but such deals require quite a bit of planning. Every step had to be taken in a particular order on this deal. There were plenty of pitfalls waiting for the unwary.
