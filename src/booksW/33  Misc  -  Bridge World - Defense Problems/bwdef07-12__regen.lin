cp||at|: WAIT AND SEE. West's problem is, after wining this trick--if he must, to figure out whether to lead a heart or a diamond to get East on lead for the club ruff that will be the setting trick. With a surplus trump, West should duck the first spade lead. Then, on the second spade lead, East can give an unambiguous signal to indicate the suit West should lead. It is then easy for West to lead a heart and get the club ruff.|

If East plays the ace of spades at trick one, depriving the defense of a later entry to play a spade through South, declarer can make the contract no matter how the subsequent defense goes. However, if East plays his queen of spades at trick one, the defense is in control. If South ducks, the continuation of the ace and another spade will set up four tricks for the defense while it still has a diamond entry. |

cp||at|There is an one advanced opening lead concept which is an exception to this rule. When declarer has bid a suit that is likely to be exactly 4 cards in length. and you hold 4+ cards in the suit with 2 honors (or even 1 honor and the 10 or 9), leading that suit, although a bit risky, can work out well. So, if West had started with A10xxx or Q10xxx of spades, a spade is probably the best lead. But with 10xxxx, although it happens to work out on this hand, it is normally not a good lead. |

Although it turns out I still should play the @sQ at trick 1, even if he has that holding, I easily might have played the @sA and then the @sQ. Having said that, the general principle of having the defense duck to preserve communications, particularly in NT, is a good principle to remember. It is mirror image of why declarer ducks. For the defense, ducking preserves communication, whereas for declarer ducking severs communication.|

cp|6|at|West discarded a lower spade than his lead. So based on West's carding (which, assuming a 4th best lead) this shows West had 5 spades. Therefore, an expert East can count out South's hand starting with 2 spades, 5 hearts, 2 clubs, and therefore 4 diamonds.|

cp||at|: NOW OR NEVER. The only hope for the defense is to cash three diamond tricks before declarer can discard another diamond on the fourth club lead. Therefore, East must ruff the third round of clubs and lead a low diamond to avoid blocking the suit for the defense. West must cooperate by winning the first round of diamonds with the ace, another unblock, and then returning the suit. Next you can play the entire hand double dummy.|
