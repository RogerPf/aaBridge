pc|S3|pc|SA|pc|S9|nt|This is an honor signal situation, and the 9 implies the Q since if declarer had the Q in hand he would let the lead ride to the closed hand.|

pc|DT|pc|CJ|nt|The J here announces a solid sequence - we signal with the loudest card we can afford, so West knows that East does not have the Q.|

pc|S5|pc|ST|nt|This is a count signal situation.  Dummy wins with a card smaller than the K, so 3rd hand signals count with the 2 showing 1, 3 or 5.|

nt|Can't be 5, so East must have 1 or 3@ss. |

pc|S3|nt|West must assume that East has 3, and that the small @s will knock out the A in the closed hand.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


pc|SJ|pc|S9|nt|East doesn't really need to unblock the 9, but it's a good habit to develop.|

pc|HT|nt|Either major could be dangerous, but one of them must be right.  @H is safer to lead from.
