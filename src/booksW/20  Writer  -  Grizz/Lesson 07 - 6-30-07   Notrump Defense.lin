Partner rates to have some stuff.  Here South needs only 1 trick from North.|

nt|Decision time for East.  If he can find West's entry, the defense wins big.  But if he tries to establish @S and hope that his @cQ will be an entry, he loses big.  West already signalled where his entry was, do you remember what it was?|

pc|C5|nt|On the second @H trick, won by South with the A, West played the 2.  He had lots of other cards to play, so the 2 was significant.  It showed an entry in the lowest side suit, @Cs.  So even though the @C suit in dummy looks ominous, East believes his partner and leads back a @C.|
