^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 383 - January 12, 2004^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played by ^*BJannes van 't Oever^*N in a recent mixed teams event in The Netherlands. Jannes, a regular reader of ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N, describes himself as "not a top ranking player (yet)". Apparently Jannes is confident in his own potential as a bridge player and, when you see how he played this week's deal, I think you will agree that he is right to be confident!

Still, Jannes has his work cut out for him if he wants to become one of the leading Dutch players. The Netherlands has more bridge players per capita than any other country in the world and, among them, there are dozens of world class players. You will have a chance to see Dutch bridge at its best January 24-25 during a ^*Blive^*N vugraph broadcast of the ^*BDutch Meesterklasse Final^*N on ^*BBridge Base Online^*N (^*BBBO^*N). Session starting times will be posted at:

hs|sc|nt|In this week's deal, ^*BJannes van 't Oever^*N, dealt and opened 1NT as South. Jannes' partner responded 2@S as a transfer to clubs. Jannes was playing in a first time partnership that had spent very little time discussing bidding. They had no agreements about the rest of the bids in the auction, but when the smoke cleared, Jannes was the declarer in 6@C. |
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


nt||ls|sc|pc|HK|at|The opening lead was the @HK and a first glance at the dummy suggested that the contract had no chance. |
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|at|Unless the @SK was singleton (yeah right), there was a certain spade loser |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|hs|nd|Hs|sd|at|and there was at least one certain diamond loser even if the @DK was singleton (sure). Can you think of any not completely miraculous layout of the East-West cards where 6@C can be made?|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|sh|nt|Jannes came up with a plan that would require considerable luck, but not so much as to qualify as a miracle. He won the first trick with the @HA |

pc|H8|pc|HQ|pc|CA|pc|HJ|at|(they were 4-4).|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sc|nt|Can you see what Jannes was trying to accomplish with all of those hearts ruffs? He had essentailly executed a ^*Bdummy reversal^*N by taking 3 ruffs in the long hand, but since he always could have ruffed a spade in his hand, the dummy reversal did not gain a trump trick. |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|sk||hc|skdk|nt|Jannes knew that his best chance to make 6@C was to eventually apply pressure to a defender who was dealt both the @SK and the @DK. In order for the ending that Jannes had in mind to function, the defender with the @SK and @DK would have to be stripped of his hearts. That's why Jannes got so involved in ruffing hearts.|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sc|lc|skdk|nt|The declarer continued by playing 2 more rounds of trump. |

pg| ***** 21 ***** |


ls|ws|at|Suppose he had made the mistake of discarding a diamond. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


ls|wd|pc|d7|hs|nd|at|Jannes would have discarded a diamond from the dummy, |

ls|ns|hs|nd|Hs|ed|hs|sd|mc|12|at|and East being endplayed into leading away from the @DK, the result would be that the declarer would win the rest of the tricks to make his contract. |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


ls|ed|ls|nd|ls|sd|up|5|hs|es|

pg| ***** 33 ***** |


ls|es|pc|sk|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


hs|ns|Hs|ss|hs|Es|at|Jannes would be able to counter by cashing dummy's @SQ (stripping East's last card in that suit) |

pg| ***** 41 ***** |


ls|ed|pc|d3|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


hs|nd|Hs|sd|Hs|ed|at|The declarer could then play a diamond to the @DA (if East unblocked the @DK it would be immediately fatal for the defense) |

pg| ***** 46 ***** |


hs|sd|at|Jannes' @DQ would be a winner |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


ls|sd|hs|es|hs|ns|Hs|ss|mc|12|at|and East would have to lead away from his @SK. |
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|ls|es|up|11|hs|ws|nt|At the table, West correctly discarded a spade (instead of a diamond) on Jannes' final trump. |
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


ls|ws|pc|s7|hs|nd|at|This play kept the defense in the game and, after a diamond was discarded from the dummy, |
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


ls|nd|pc|d5|hs|es|Hs|ed|at|the spotlight shifted to East. |
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


ls|ed|at|A spade discard would lead to a position that we have seen already, |
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


ls|es|hs|ed|at|but East chose his suit wisely and discarded a diamond. |
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


ls|ed|hc|d3|nt|Unfortunately for the defense, East did not choose his diamond wisely. He discarded the @D3 (do you see why East needs that card?). |
pg| ***** 54 ***** |

pg| ***** 55 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|at|Jannes was now able to make his contract legitimately. He played a diamond to the @DA. |

ls|nd|ls|sd|
pc|D2|pc|D7|pc|DA|hc|dk|at|East had the presence of mind to drop his @DK (otherwise he would be endplayed as before), but it was too late for him to get out of his own way.|

hs|nd|nt|When Jannes led the last diamond off the dummy, |
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


ls|nd|pc|d8|hs|ed|at|East followed suit with the @DJ |
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


ls|ed|pc|DJ|hs|sd|at|and Jannes allowed him to win the trick with that card!  |
pg| ***** 61 ***** |

pg| ***** 62 ***** |


hs|es|hs|ss|hs|ns|mc|12|at|East had won an unexpected (and unwanted) diamond trick, but he was now forced to lead a spade away from his @SK and Jannes was able to chalk up his ambitious slam. |
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|ls|es|up|9|hs|ed|nt|As you no doubt understand now, if East had discarded his @DJ (or @DK) instead of the @D3 on Jannes's last trump, |
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


ls|ed|pc|dj|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|Hs|ed|at|he could subsequently defeat the contract by dropping his remaining high diamond under dummy's @DA. |

ls|nd|ls|ed|ls|sd|pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|da|pc|dk|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


hs|ed|mc|11|at|There would be no way to endplay East with the lowly @D3 and the declarer would be left without recourse. |
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


ls|ed|up|35|nt|While East could have defeated 6@C, Jannes still should be applauded for reading the cards well in the endgame and for finding a line of play that would give him a chance. |
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


md|0,s4c5,,d94|hs|ed|hs|es|at|If, for example, East had been dealt 5 diamonds headed by the @DK along with the @SK, there would be no winning defense to counter Jannes' line.|
