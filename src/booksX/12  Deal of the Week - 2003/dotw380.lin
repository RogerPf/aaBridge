^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 380 - December 22, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
^*BMatthew^*N and ^*BPamela Granovetter^*N are partners in the true sense of the word. They were bridge partners when Matthew declared this week's deal. They are also partners in life as well as business. Their latest business venture is a terrific web site:

|cs|1|at|^-{ ^*Hwww.bridgetoday.com^*N }
^-
^*BBridge Today^*N, once one of the best and most popular bridge magazines in the world, is now out of print, but the magazine lives on through the Internet. Matt and Pam are prolific authors. Bridge players of all levels find their writing to be both entertaining and instructive. There is a lot of excellent bridge content available through bridgetoday.com and a lot of it is free.

The Bridge Today web site has more than just articles. It also contains an online bridge university. Visitors can register for courses taught by Matt, Pam, and other leading players (including ^*BPaul Soloway^*N and ^*BLarry Cohen^*N). Courses are designed for either beginner, intermediate, or advanced players and cover various areas of bidding, card play, and defense.

A lot of people have opinions on how bridge concepts ^*Ishould^*N be presented on a web page. I have considerable experience in this area and, for whatever it's worth, I really like the design of the Bridge Today site. The graphics are attractive and clear and the interactive quizzes are well done.

pc|C3|at|West's opening lead was the @C3. Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


hs|nc|nt|Matthew got off to a good start when he played the @C2 from the dummy at trick 1. While West might have been dealt the @CQ, East's takeout double made him a favorite to hold that card. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


ls|nc|pc|c2|hs|nc|ls|nc|hs|nc|at|Matthew knew that East was going to gain the lead sooner or later. The fact that Matthew had retained the @CKJ in the dummy would make it costly for East to lead clubs again.|

hs|sc|nt|East inserted the @C9 and Matthew won his @CA. |

hc|dt|at|He led the @D10 to the next trick (some random correspondent named ^*BEddie Kantar^*N suggested that the @DQ would have been a better card to play - West would be more likely to cover the @DQ than the @D10 and a cover would be most welcome given the lack of entries to the closed hand). |

ls|ns|hs|sh|at|and East's takeout double marked him with the @HA. |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt|The declarer's main problem was that he did not have an entry to his own hand. He could set up the @HK as a winner, but he could not get to it. |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


ls|sh|hs|nd|at|Matthew saw that if he ran dummy's diamonds, he would not have to depend on the heart suit to provide his 9th winner. |
