^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 354 - June 23, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
Canada will be represented by a refreshingly young team (Captain ^*BKamel Fergani^*N-^*BNick L'Ecuyer^*N, ^*BJurek Czyzowicz^*N-^*BDarren Wolpert^*N and ^*BGavin Wolpert^*N-^*BVincent Demuy^*N) in international competition during the next year. This team became Team Canada as a result of their recent win in the 2003 ^*BCanadian National Teams Championships^*N (CNTC) and their subsequent win in a playoff match against the 2002 CNTC winners.

Both Nick (in his early 30s) and Darren (27) have played on Canada's Junior Team (for players under 26) in recent years, but these 2 are almost ancient compared to Darren's younger brother Gavin (20) and Vince (19). It is strange that 2 of the members of Team Canada are not old enough to order an alcoholic drink in most parts of the country that they live in!

Early indications are that Gavin and Vince are going to set the world on fire (the bridge world at least). They work hard on their partnership and they have been playing in a lot of ACBL Regional tournaments during the past year. During the last few months, 4 of America's leading professional players (^*BRoger Bates^*N, ^*BBilly Miller^*N, ^*BPaul Soloway^*N, and ^*BEddie Wold^*N) have approached me out of the blue to tell me how well Gavin and Vince have been playing.

Gavin and Vince are 2 of the finest young men you could ever hope to meet and all Canadian bridge players should be very proud that they will be representing Canada in international competition during the next year. Our congratulations go out to the entire Fergani team for their recent accomplishments!

nt|This week's deal was played by ^*BVince Demuy^*N in the second segment of the 2003 CNTC Final. The deal has been rotated to make South the declarer. |

pg| ***** 3 ***** |


mb|p|mb|2S|hs|ss|nt|No doubt the transfer system that Gavin and Vince use after a 1@D overcall of a 1@C opening works rather well on some deals, but I am sure that on this deal Vince was wishing that his partnership had been using "normal" negative doubles. As it was, Vince was forced to bid 2@S with a 3-card suit |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |

at|What do you suppose happened to the defense? |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt|What happened was that East-West had a misunderstanding about the basic nature of an encouraging attitude signal. There are 2 reasonable interpretations of such a signal: "I have a key missing honor in this suit" and "I want you to continue playing this suit". Clearly East intended his @H2 to give the second message, but West thought the first message should apply.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt|When this deal was played, East-West were 2 of Canada's most successful players who were playing in a relatively new partnership. I have left their names out as to not cause them any embarassment. If these 2 could have a misunderstanding about such a basic signaling concept, perhaps you should resolve this issue with your regular partner!|

ls|nh|ls|ss|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|sT|
hs|ws|sk||nt|You can now see how the remaining cards were distributed when this deal was actually played. West had to overruff with the @SK (or else Vince would have his 7th trick in with the @DA and a trump trick still to come). |

pg| ***** 30 ***** |


hc|d9|ls|es|nt|In what seemed like about half a second to the audience watching the match being broadcast live through ^*BBridge Base Online^*N, Vince found the very pretty (and necessary) play of leading the @D9 from the dummy - this is not exactly the sort of play you see everyday! |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


lc|d9|pc|d9|hs|ed|at|He was happy to see East follow with the @D8. |

pg| ***** 34 ***** |


mc|9|hs|wd|hs|es|nt|Vince actually claimed 9 tricks at this point. He knew that West was endplayed into leading a diamond away from his @DK and that East's @S7 would be the last trick for the defense regardless of whether West led the @DK or a small diamond at this point. That was one fine piece of declarer play, especially when you consider that ^*BVince Demuy^*N is only 19 years old!|
