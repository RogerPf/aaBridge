^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 381 - December 29, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
This week's deal arose last week at an ACBL Regional in Reno, Nevada. Sorry that this week's deal is late, but between 3 sessions of bridge a day and the distractions of both the holiday season and being in Reno, I have not had much time. In case you were wondering, the ^*BDeal of the Week^*N is almost always written at the last minute :)

May 2004 be a year of good health, good times, and good bridge for you!

pc|HJ|hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|West's opening lead is the @HJ and your partner's dummy is a disappointment as usual. What is not usual is that this disappointing dummy is too good (you are used to dummy's that take no tricks). All you need is a 3-2 trump break to make 6@S |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|hs|nc|hs|sc|at|and 6@C is almost laydown. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|nh|nt|You mechanically call for a small heart from the dummy, |

pg| ***** 12 ***** |


hs|wc|hs|ws|mc|9|sk||at|As West has only 2 clubs to go with his 5 spades, there is no way to make 4@S. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


ls|ws|ls|wc|hs|nc|hs|sc|at|The good news is that 6@C would not have made either... |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


up|4|nt|Stop thinking about clubs! If you hadn't been thinking so much about alternative contracts and alternative bids when the play started |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|ns|hs|ss|at|you would have made 4@S. Do you see how you should have played after ruffing the second round of hearts?|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|The correct play is to win the first round of trump with an honor in your hand (instead of playing a spade to the dummy's @SA). |
