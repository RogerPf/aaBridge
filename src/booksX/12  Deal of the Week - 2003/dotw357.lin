^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 357 - July 14, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
I am grateful to the fine people at ^*BCassell Publishing^*N who, in association with ^*BPeter Crawley^*N, have produced an excellent collection of bridge books (entilted ^*IThe Master Bridge Series^*N) and who continue to send me free copies of their publications.

They must be hoping that I will review some of these books in ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N. Over 10,000 people read each ^*BDeal of the Week^*N on our web site and I send over 1000 people copies of each ^*BDeal of the Week^*N by e-mail attachment (e-mail me at ^*Bfred@@bridgebase.com^*N if you want to get on this e-mail list).

For the record, I do book reviews from time to time in this feature, but I am not paid for this. Furthermore, I only review books both that I enjoyed and those that I think readers of this column will enjoy. Several of the books in the ^*IMaster Bridge Series^*N satisfy these conditions, but the content of only a few of these books is appropriate for presentation in ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N.

^*IInspired Card Play^*N by ^*BDavid Bird^*N and ^*BMartin Hoffman^*N, 2 of England's most respected and prolific bridge writers, allows for presentation in this medium. The cover of ^*IInspired Card Play^*N prominently features the word "Intermediate". While I suspect that most intermediate players would enjoy reading this book, I considered most of the deals in it to be quite advanced. Having read plenty of books by both Bird and Hoffman, I was not at all surprised by the high quality of the deals that appeared in this book.

^*IInspired Card Play^*N consists of 12 chapters with titles like ^*IAvoiding Ruffs^*N, ^*IPreparing for a Squeeze^*N, and ^*IReading Declarer's Mind^*N. Each chapter consists of several challenging problems in play and/or defense. Each deal is accompanied by a well-written analysis and by a general tip that can be applied to similar deals in the future. This week's deal comes from the chapter of ^*IInspired Card Play^*N entitled ^*IHandling a Bad Trump Break^*N.

The offices of ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N will be closed from ^*BJuly 17^*N to ^*BJuly 29^*N during the ^*BACBL's Summer North American Bridge Championships^*N in Long Beach, California.

At least the Finals of the ^*BSpingold^*N (and perhaps the Semi-Finals as well) will be broadcast ^*Blive^*N from Long Beach through ^*BBridge Base Online^*N (^*BBBO^*N). The ^*BSao Paulo State Championships Final^*N will also be broadcast live in the upcoming weeks. A schedule of upcoming live vugraph broadcasts on ^*BBBO^*N can be found at:

|cs|1|at|^-{ ^*Hwww.bridgebase.com/online/vg.html^*N }

Both the software you will need to watch these broadcasts as well as access to the broadcasts themselves is ^*B100% free^*N. To download the software that will install ^*BBBO^*N on your PC, visit:

lc|ht|pc|HT|pc|HJ|hs|sh|at|The result is a matter of good news and bad news. The good news is that East covers with the @HJ. The bad news is that, after you win the trick in your hand, |

ls|ns|ls|ss|hs|nc|hs|nd|hs|wd|hs|wc|at|is to arrange to squeeze West in the minors. Careful timing is required in order to reach a successful squeeze position. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|nc|ls|wd|ls|wc|hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|Your first move should be to cross to the dummy in spades (can you see why it would be wrong to cross in diamonds?) |

ls|nd|ls|nc|nt|Discarding the @SK is obviously a bad idea |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


ls|ns|hs|nd|hs|wc|hs|wd|hs|nc|at|and a minor suit discard will destroy the threat in that suit, making it impossible to squeeze West. |

pc|H6|hs|nd|hs|nc|hs|wd|hs|wc|mc|12|nt|West will be caught in a ^*Bsimple squeeze^*N between diamonds and clubs on this trick. Whatever minor suit he discards will set up a winner in the dummy. You will discard from the other minor to score up your slam. |

hs|ns|hs|nd|hs|nc|nt|Unfortunately, the dummy would again be the victim of a 3-suit squeeze on this trick. |
