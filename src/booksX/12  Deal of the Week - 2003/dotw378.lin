nt|This week's first deal took place in the first final session of the ^*BReisinger Board-A-Match Teams^*N at the recent ^*BACBL Fall North American Championships^*N in New Orleans. One of the world's greatest players arrived in 3NT on the auction shown above. The actual declarer failed to spot the correct line. Would you have done better?

nt|Obviously the contract is secure, but since the Reisinger is a board-a-match event, overtricks are very important. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|at|The declarer had won 3 tricks already and still had 2 top winners in spades, |

pg| ***** 13 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|at|That's 11 tricks in total and there were chances in both black suits (not to mention plenty of squeeze chances) to come to a 12th trick. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|ls|nc|ls|sc|nt|
Can you see the best way to try to win a 12th trick on this deal? Think about how you would continue as the declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt|In fact, there is a relatively simple way to ensure 12 tricks regardless of the layout of the East-West cards. I found it interesting that neither the superstar declarer that played this hand nor any of the experts who were doing vugraph commentary when this deal appeared ^*Blive^*N on ^*BBridge Base Online^*N were able to spot the winning line. |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sh|nt|All the declarer has to do to ensure 12 tricks is to cash a third round of hearts |

hs|sc|at|When East follows small (if he plays an honor then you can win and set up your 12th trick in clubs), play the @C10 or @C9 from your hand. |

pg| ***** 22 ***** |


hs|ws|hs|wd|hs|wc|at|but he would then find himself endplayed in 3 suits. Regardless of whether West returns a spade, a diamond, or a club, and regardless of how the East-West cards are distributed, 12 tricks are certain - cool! |mc|12|

nt|This week's second deal was dealt in a game that took place on Saturday at ^*BBill Gates'^*N house in Seattle. I was Bill's partner when this week's deal was played, but we were unable to arrive at the contract that I am going to discuss. Bill and I were playing against ^*BWarren Buffett^*N and ^*BSharon Osberg^*N when this week's deal was played.|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|Besides being among the greatest businessmen in history, both Bill and Warren are avid bridge players. Warren has been playing bridge for many years. He is a solid player with excellent bidding judgment. He enjoys a successful partnership with his long time friend Sharon (a former World Champion as well as one super player).|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|Bill Gates has been playing bridge for about 5 years. He does not get to play very often due to the demands of his schedule, but Bill has spent a lot of his leisure time during recent years studying the game. It will come as no surprise to you to learn that Bill has an amazing mind for bridge. His rate of progress (especially given how little he plays) has been remarkable.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|A lot of people ask me what it is like to play bridge with men like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. It is refreshingly fun. Playing bridge with these guys reminds me of the joy and fascination I had with the game when I first started playing. I still love bridge, of course, but nowadays playing the game is part of my livelihood. It is not as much fun as it used to be.|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|Besides the bridge itself, it has been a wonderful experience to become friends with Bill and Warren (Sharon also happens to be one of my favorite people). I consider myself very lucky to have had the opportunity to have been part of this bridge group (I am also lucky to have the best wife, dog, and job in the world and I seem to win more than my fair share of finesses!). |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|P|mb|?|
hs|sc|nt|Back to this week's deal where I made a bid that was (perhaps deservedly) unlucky. I opened 1@C as South, Warren overcalled 1@S, Bill bid 2@D, and Sharon passed. This set up a nasty bidding problem for me. 3@C (and 2NT) would be non-forcing. I could have cuebid 2@S or bid a non-suit with 2@H, but I was concerned about the complications that might follow from these actions. |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt|My choice, an admittedly sick 3NT, didn't rate to result in any complications (it rated to end the auction), but I was concerned about missing slam. In retrospect, perhaps I should have bid 4@C with the intention of playing in either 5@C or 6@C, depending on how the auction continued. |mb|4C|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


at|On the actual deal, Bill would have likely jumped to 6@C which would have ended the auction. |mb|P|mb|6C|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt||ls|sc|pc|SJ|
at|Warren would have probably led the @SJ. Yes, he almost certainly had both missing Aces given his overcall, but Warren has been around long enough to know not to put all of his eggs in one basket by leading an Ace after an auction like the one shown above. Assume that Warren has the @DA and the @CA and think about how you would play as the declarer before reading on.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|First things first. You had better hope that spades are 5-2. If Warren has 6 spades then there is nothing you can do to prevent him from winning the @CA and giving his partner a spade ruff. There is a line of play that depends upon little more than spades being 5-2. Do you see what it is?|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


ls|ss|nt|I believe that the correct line of play is to win the first trick with dummy's @SA, |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |

up|8|hs|ss|hs|nc|at|You can prevent this by ruffing your remaining (winning) spade in the dummy. |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


ls|ss|ls|nc|hs|nh|hs|sh|nt|You are going to have to cross to your hand twice. Whether you should do this in hearts once |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|hs|nd|hs|sc|at|or with 2 diamond ruffs is a subject I will not discuss fully. Suppose you ruff a diamond next, |
