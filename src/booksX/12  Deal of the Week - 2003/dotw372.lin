^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 372 - October 27, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
I am told that there are approximately 100 million people in the world who know how to play bridge. This week's deal was played by one of my very favorite bridge players, ^*BBénédicte Cronier^*N of France. Béné played this week's deal on ^*BBridge Base Online^*N (^*BBBO^*N), the ^*B100% free^*N online bridge service that was developed by my company.

The fact that Béné is a world class bridge player who frequently plays on ^*BBBO^*N is not what makes her special - there are ^*Bmany^*N other great champions who have made ^*BBBO^*N into their online home for bridge. What makes Béné special is Béné herself - she is one of the most charming, enthusiastic, and fun bridge players I have ever met.

Béné cares deeply about the future of our game and I am fortunate that she has recognized the potential that ^*BBBO^*N offers in terms of helping to make bridge more popular. Béné was one of the main driving forces behind organizing our recent ^*Blive^*N online vugraph broadcasts of the ^*B2003 World Youth Team Championships^*N. She was also one of the key people in terms of arranging for our upcoming vugraph coverage of the ^*B2003 World Bridge Championships^*N.

These championships will take place in Monte Carlo from November 2 to 15. Every session will be covered ^*Blive^*N on ^*BBBO^*N and experts from around the world will be on hand to provide the audience with commentary and analysis in several languages. I am grateful to both Béné and her friend, ^*BHervé Lustman^*N, for making it possible for ^*BBBO^*N to cover this year's World Championships.

hs|sh|nt|In this week's deal, ^*BBénédicte Cronier^*N, South, ended up as the declarer in 4@H after a strong notrump opening followed by a Stayman sequence. |

hs|ss|hs|sd|hs|sc|hs|nh|hs|ns|hs|nd|hs|nc|at|The opening lead was the @CA and Béné's partner put down a nice 4333 hand, just like hers! What do you think about the concept of bidding Stayman when you are dealt a 4333 hand?|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


ls|ss|ls|sh|ls|sd|ls|sc|nt|Obviously one deal doesn't prove anything, but on this deal 3NT looks like a better contract than 4@H (as would usually be the case when both hands are 4333). My personal style is that I rarely bid Stayman when I am 4333, but there are plenty of very successful players who would disagree with my opinions in this area. |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|I will bid Stayman on a 4333 hand when I have the values to play in a small slam. The reason is that, if opener is also 4333, there will sometimes be extra chances to make 6 of a major (via an endplay for example) that would not be available in 6NT. If opener is not 4333, then the possibility of being able to take a ruff in his hand also favors playing in a suit contract.|

pg| ***** 19 ***** |


sk||
hc|skjdkj|nt|What Béné (correctly) made of that was that West rated to have most, if not all, of the outstanding high cards. There were 2 reasons for this. First, West's strange opening (the @CA from @CA10xx) becomes a little less strange. Second, East's trick 1 signal to encourage clubs with @C9xx suggested that he did not want West to switch to a different suit.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


hc|dqsq|nt|Inferring that her @SQ and @DQ were badly placed was only half of the battle. The other half, doing something about it, was not especially challenging for a player of Bénédicte's quality. |
