^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 377 - December 1, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
Once again I am sorry that this week's deal was posted late. I just got home from a 10-day trip to the ^*BACBL Fall North American Bridge Championships^*N in New Orleans and I was unable to work on ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N while I was away.

Since you patiently waited for both this week's and last week's deals, I decided to reward you.

cs|2|at|^-{ ^*BSPECIAL!!! There are 2 Deals of the Week this week!^*N }
^-
|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


at|Both deals were played at the New Orleans tournament and feature my regular partner, ^*BBrad Moss^*N, and myself on defense.

The big events at the ACBL Fall Nationals are all scored using either matchpoints or board-a-match. At both of these forms of the game, overtricks and extra undertricks are very important (these things are far less important at IMPs). In both of this week's deals it was easy for Brad and me to defeat the declarers' contracts, but we had to work hard to get a 2nd undertrick.

This week's first deal was played in the 2nd semi-final session of the ^*BReisinger Board-A-Match Teams^*N. This week's second deal was played in the 1st semi-final session of the ^*BBlue Ribbon Pairs^*N. Neither deal really lends itself well to being presented as a problem so I will show you all 52 cards at the start of each deal. Both of these deals were rotated to make South the declarer.

pg| ***** 6 ***** |


mb|2h|ls|ss|hs|wh|nt|With a nice fit for both of my partner's suits, I thought about getting busy, but given that Brad was a passed hand and that my singleton @CK rated to be worthless, I chose to bid a simple 2@H. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


mb|3h|ls|wh|hs|nc|at|North, with a big hand in support of his partner's club suit, cuebid 3@H |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


mb|p|mb|3n|ls|nc|hs|sh|at|and South made the questionable choice of bidding 3NT (questionable because he didn't really have a heart stopper). |

hs|wd|hs|wh|nt|3NT was the final contract and I had to choose between a normal heart and a "surprise" diamond as my opening lead. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


ls|wh|ls|wd|hs|eh|at|You might be thinking that Brad should have doubled 3@H in order to make my life easier, but we have found that doubling cuebids in these kinds of auctions often helps the opponents (by giving them 2 extra choices, pass and redouble, that they would not normally have). |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


ls|eh|hc|h3|nt|Fortunately (for our side at least) I chose to put my faith in my 5-card suit and lead a 4th best @H3. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |

We had already defeated the contract by one trick, but of course I wanted to score as many extra undertricks as possible. Do you know what suit I led now and why I played that suit? |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


ls|ws|ls|wc|nt|It may seem obvious to lead a diamond now. Not only had Brad suggested diamond length and strength in the bidding, but he had also made a strongly encouraging signal in that suit. Still, I suspected that, if I played a diamond, we would not win another trick on this deal. |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


ls|wd|pc|d2|hs|nd|Hs|ed|hs|sd|nt|If I had led a diamond then the dummy's @DQ would be covered by Brad's @DK and the declarer's @DA. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|ed|ls|sd|pc|dq|pc|dk|pc|da|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


hs|nc|Hs|sc|hs|wc|at|The declarer would then have to bring in the club suit in order to take the rest of the tricks. The percentage play with this club combination is to lead the @CQ from the dummy on the first round of the suit and finesse Brad for the @CK. |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|I knew, however, that if the play had continued as described, the declarer would know that taking the club finesse would be futile. Brad had already shown up with the @HAQJ and a diamond return by me would expose the @DK in his hand. |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


md|0,c3,,ck|ls|wc|hs|ec|at|If Brad had been dealt the @CK as well then he would have had at least 13 HCP and he certainly would have opened the bidding. |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |

If I had switched to diamonds after running the hearts, the declarer would have known to drop my singleton @CK. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


up|4|ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|ws|ls|wc|
at|I therefore switched to a spade instead of a diamond. |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


ls|ws|pc|s5|hs|ns|nt|Perhaps the declarer should have asked himself why I had not returned a diamond, but perhaps he was annoyed that he was going down in 3NT on a deal where 6@C is an excellent contract. He won my spade return in the dummy |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |

mb|P|mb|P|mb|1C|
hs|nc|nt|In this week's 2nd deal, North opened the bidding with a light 1@C in 3rd position after his partner had passed a hand as South that most would open. |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


ls|nc|hs|sc|at|South, with a big fit for clubs and something in each of the other suits, more than made up for his lack of aggressiveness on the first round of bidding by jumping all the way to 3NT at his 2nd turn. 3NT was the final contract. |mb|P|mb|3N|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|

lc|sakdakhk|hs|nc|hs|sc|at|and the declarer had only 7 top tricks (the @HA and 6 club tricks). He chose to run all 6 of the clubs immediately. Can you see how we were able to hold South to the 7 tricks he was dealt?|

lc|h3|pc|h3|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


hs|wh|at|Given that he had led a 4th best @H5, I now knew that Brad had been dealt a 5-card heart suit and that the declarer's @HA had been a singleton. |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


ls|wh|pc|C8|hc|d7|at|My first discard was my lowest diamond, an upside down attitude signal. |
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


lc|d7|pc|D7|pc|CT|hc|s3|at|Brad also discarded an (upside down) encouraging card on this trick - he played the @S3 to let me know he had the @SA. |

hs|sc|nt|When declarer led his 2nd last club, |
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


ls|sc|pc|CJ|Hc|dtd9|at|both of the defenders discarded diamonds. Brad's @D10 was a discouraging signal that denied the @DJ (he would have pitched the @DJ if he had been dealt both the @DJ and @D10). I parted with the @D9, clarifying to Brad that my @D7 (which might have looked like a high diamond from his point of view), had actually been a encouraging signal.|

hs|sc|nt|On the 6th and final round of clubs, |

ls|wh|pc|h6|pc|D8|

pg| ***** 63 ***** |


ls|wh|pc|h8|hs|nh|hs|wh|hs|eh|at|The declarer would then have to guess the position of the heart honors in order to go down only 1 in his contract. |
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


nt|The problem with this line of defense is that it would leave the fate of the 2nd potential undertrick in the hands of the declarer. |
pg| ***** 65 ***** |
