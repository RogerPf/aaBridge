^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 373 - November 3, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played by ^*BPierre-Yves Guillaumin^*N in partnership with ^*BJean-Paul Meyer^*N in a recent game on ^*BBridge Base Online^*N (^*BBBO^*N). Both Pierre-Yves  and Jean-Paul are among France's leading bridge players and journalists.

Every session of the ^*B2003 World Bridge Championships^*N (November 3 - November 15) will be broadcast ^*Blive^*N from Monte Carlo on ^*BBBO^*N. Expert commentary and analysis will be available in 9 (!) different languages. My thanks go out to ^*BRoland Wald^*N, who has arranged a remarkable group of about 50 leading players from all over the world to help us with commentary.

Pierre-Yves will be one of our French-language commentators.  Jean-Paul will be performing the same service for the vugraph audience at the playing site.

Other notable commentators for our ^*BBBO^*N broadcasts from Monte Carlo:

^*BPhilippe Cronier^*N, ^*BAlain Levy^*N, and ^*BJean-Christophe Quantin^*N (France), ^*BPer Olof Sundelin^*N and ^*BAnders Wirgen^*N (Sweden), ^*BMarcin Lesniewski^*N and ^*BKrzysztof Martens^*N (Poland), ^*BDano De Falco^*N, ^*BStelio Di Bello^*N and ^*BFabio Lo Presti^*N (Italy), and ^*BSøren Christiansen^*N (Denmark).  

^*BMichael Rosenberg^*N, ^*BRichard Pavlicek^*N and ^*BMildred Breed^*N are among dozens of star players who will provide commentary in English.
