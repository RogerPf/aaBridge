nt|In this week's deal, ^*BVince Demuy^*N, South, liked his 14-count enough to open a strong notrump in 3rd position. ^*BGavin Wolpert^*N, North, used Stayman and placed the contract in 3NT when Vince denied a 4-card major. |
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


pc|s5|at|The opening lead was the @S5 (the opponents were playing 2nd and 4th best leads - they would lead the middle card from a 3-card suit and low from a 4-card suit). |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|You can take a moment to think about how you would play this deal as declarer if you want, but I really have no idea what the right play to the first few tricks is. What is really interesting about this deal is the endgame that Vince reached so let's get to that point in the play. If you really want to think about how you would play as declarer, please do so now before reading on.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


hs|ns|nt|Vince chose to duck the first trick in dummy |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


ls|ns|pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|s3|at|and East's @S9 won the trick. |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


pc|c6|hs|sc|at|After considerable thought, East returned the @C6 and Vince's @C10 |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


ls|sc|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|c5|at|was taken by West with the @CJ. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


pc|s8|hs|ns|at|When West came back the @S8, Vince tried the @SQ from dummy, |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ls|ns|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s6|at|but East won the @SK - not a great start for the declarer! |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


pc|cK|hs|sc|at|Prospects improved when East returned the @CK, won by Vince with the @CA. |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |

hs|sh|nt|Vince tried the effect of leading the @HK from his hand |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


ls|sh|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h6|at|and West won the trick with the @HA. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|It was now West's turn to go into the tank. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


pc|c4|hs|nh|at|When he emerged, the @C4 was on the table. Vince discarded a heart from dummy. |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


ls|nh|pc|h8|pc|h4|hs|sc|at|East pitched a heart as well and Vince won the trick. |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


ls|sc|pc|c9|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


at|This is a good time to stop and think about how you would play from here. |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|Apparently West still had 2 spades left, but if this was the case then |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|hs|nd|hs|sd|at|the diamond finesse rated to be working (because West would have cleared the spades instead of returning a club if he had been dealt the @DK). As such Vince, who needed all 7 of the remaning tricks, had 6 winners |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|nh|hs|sh|at|and a finesse against the @HJ was the most obvious source for his game-going trick.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|Vince realized that, if the heart finesse was working, there was no reason to take it and he could give himself an extra chance to make his contract by not finessing in hearts. He therefore continued with a heart to dummy's @HQ |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h3|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


hs|nd|at|and led the @DQ from the dummy. |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


ls|nd|pc|dQ|pc|dK|hs|sd|at|East covered with the @DK and Vince won his @DA. |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


ls|sd|pc|dA|pc|d3|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


hs|sd|nt|Vince then cashed his @DJ. |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


ls|sd|pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|d6|at|When both defenders followed small, Vince knew that his extra chance (that West had been dealt a doubleton @D10) had not materialized. |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


hs|sc|at|He soldiered on by finishing the clubs. |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


ls|sc|pc|cQ|pc|c8|at|At the table West followed suit to this trick and showed Vince his hand. |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


sk||at|He knew enough about the deal to know that there was no way for Vince to make his contract anymore. |mc|8|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


hs|wd|nt|Suppose that, instead of a 3rd small diamond, |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


ls|wd|hs|Wh|md|0,hj,,d7|at|West had been dealt the @HJ (meaning that the heart finesse would have worked all along). |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


ls|wh|hs|nd|hs|nh|at|Vince would have to guess what to discard from the dummy on this trick. |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


ls|nh|at|If he chose to pitch a diamond, |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


ls|nd|pc|d9|pc|d7|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


hs|sc|at|then Vince's last club |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


ls|sc|pc|c3|hs|ws|hs|wh|hs|nh|hs|ns|mc|9|at|would squeeze West in the majors. |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


ls|ws|ls|ns|ls|nh|up|3|nt|Instead of playing West for the @HJ, |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


ls|wh|md|0,dt,,hj|hs|wd|at|Vince could choose to play West for the @D10 |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


ls|wd|hs|nh|at|by discarding the @H10 from the dummy on the second last club. |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


ls|nh|pc|ht|pc|h9|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


hs|sc|at|As before, Vince's last club |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


ls|sc|pc|c3|hs|ws|hs|wd|hs|ns|hs|nd|mc|9|at|would squeeze West (this time between spades and diamonds instead of spades and hearts). |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


up|3|ls|ws|ls|wd|ls|ns|ls|wd|ls|nd|md|0,d7,,dt|hc|dthj|at|As both the @HJ and @D10 had been dealt to East, Vince had no chance to make his contract in this 4-card ending. |
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


lc|hjdt|nt|
Vince had come very close to making 3NT. Do you know how he could have succeeded and where he went wrong? |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


up|6|hs|sd|nt|Let's back up to the point where Vince cashed his @DJ. This play turned out to be fatal, but it would have been necessary to spare Vince a nasty guess on a different lie of the cards. |
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


hs|sc|hs|nd|ls|sd|at|If instead Vince had cashed another round of clubs discarding a diamond from the dummy, he would have kept the ball in play. |
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


ls|sc|ls|nd|pc|cq|pc|c8|pc|d5|pc|d6|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


hs|sc|nt|On Vince's last club, |
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


ls|sc|pc|c3|hs|ws|at|West would have to keep both of his spades |
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


ls|ws|hs|wd|at|so he would pitch down to a singleton diamond. |
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


ls|wd|pc|d4|hs|ns|at|Vince could then afford to pitch the @S7 from the dummy |
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


ls|ns|pc|s7|pc|h9|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|At|and then a spade to dummy's @SA |
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|pc|s2|pc|st|pc|sa|hs|eh|hs|Ed|hs|nh|hs|sd|At|would squeeze East in hearts and diamonds. |
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


ls|ed|ls|sd|at|A heart discard would establish dummy's @H10 |
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|nh|hs|ed|at|so East would come down to one diamond, just like his partner had. |
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


ls|ed|pc|d8|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|Sd|hs|ed|Hs|wd|nt|
A diamond to the @DJ would take care of both of the defenders' remaining diamonds |
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


ls|sd|ls|ed|ls|wd|ls|nd|pc|d9|pc|dt|pc|dj|pc|d7|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


hs|sd|at|and Vince would win a glorious trick 13 with his @D2! |mc|9|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


ls|sd|up|12|nt|The 4-card ending that was reached with the hypothetical line of play just described is known as ^*Bnon-simultaneous double squeeze^*N (more technically an ^*BRFL double squeeze^*N for those of you who are familiar with ^*BClyde Love's^*N writing). This squeeze operates anytime East has the @HJ, irrespective of the position of the @D10. |
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


hs|eh|nt|While it is true that East was a favorite to hold the @HJ (because West was known to have length in both clubs and spades), it would be hard to figure out if the line of play just described is better than the one that Vince actually took (and I am not going to try!). |
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


ls|eh|nt|It would not be too difficult to calculate the odds of the double squeeze line working. The odds of success for Vince's line is much harder to judge because this depends partly on how well Vince would have guessed in the endgame (assuming there had been a winning guess to make).|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


nt|I am almost ready to put this deal to sleep, but let's think about the defense for a moment. East-West did almost everything right, but they could have left Vince without recourse. Do you see how the defense could have ensured the defeat of 3NT?|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


up|16|hs|wc|nt|At the point in which West led a club, |
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


ls|wc|hs|ws|at|a spade instead would have sealed the declarer's fate by destroying the ^*BRFL double squeeze^*N. |
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


ls|wd|hs|wd|at|A diamond return (less likely in practice) would ruin the ^*BRFL double squeeze^*N in a different way. I am not going to go into the details, but you can try to figure it out for yourself on the next page - enjoy! |
