^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 355 - June 30, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
|cs|4|at|^-{ ^*BSPECIAL!!! There are 2 Deals of the Week this week!^*N }
^-
I spent the past week playing bridge at the ^*BLas Vegas Regional^*N on a team with ^*BMike Bandler^*N, ^*BMike Katz^*N, ^*BBilly Miller^*N and ^*BPaul Soloway^*N. For almost all of the deals that I played in this tournament, my partner was Billy Miller. Billy has become one of my favorite partners and I have written about him in this column before. Besides being a top notch player and a very talented bridge writer, Billy is a fabulous partner and it is always a pleasure to play with him.

I played one 6-board Swiss Teams match with Paul Soloway as my partner (we won the match). Paul has won 4 World Championships and a whole bunch of North American Championships during a distinguished career that has spanned more than 35 years. Perhaps Paul's greatest claim to fame is that he is the ACBL's all time leading masterpoint winner.

Paul has amassed close to 60,000 masterpoints and I am happy to report that he won about 1000th of 1% of these with me as his partner! This was the first time that I had ever had the honor of being a partner or a teammate of Paul Soloway. Not only is Paul a complete class act, but he loves talking about bridge hands and I learned a great deal discussing the deals our team played with this great champion.

Thanks to Billy, Paul and the 2 Mikes for a thoroughly enjoyable tournament!

hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|Both of this week's deals feature Billy Miller and myself on defense against 2@S contracts. Neither of these deals really lend themselves well to being presented as problems so I will show you these deals with all 52 cards in view. In this week's first deal, South opened with a 15-17 1NT and played in 2@S after a Jacoby transfer sequence.

pg| ***** 10 ***** |


hs|ss|hs|ws|nt|At this point the declarer fell from grace when she led a 3rd round of spades. Billy took his @SA this time |

ls|ws|ls|ss|
pc|S4|pc|SA|pc|S7|hs|eh|at|and I discarded the @H2 on this trick. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


ls|eh|pc|H2|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


hs|wh|hs|sh|at|The declarer had given us a chance to defeat her contract, but we had to do everything right in order to take advantage of this opportunity. Billy found the first critical move when he exited in hearts, won by the declarer in her hand. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |

hs|ss|hs|ns|nt|In this week's second deal, the contract was 2@S (again) after South's 1@S opening was raised to 2@S by North. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|hs|ws|at|Once again Billy did well on his opening lead (something he excels at) when he selected a low trump. |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


ls|ws|

pg| ***** 31 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|
pc|C3|hc|c9|at|Billy followed with the @C9 on this trick and this turned out to be a critically important signal. |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


lc|c9|pc|C9|hs|wc|nt|Billy's @C9 told me that he had been dealt an even number of clubs. Furthermore, if that even number happened to be 4 (which seemed likely from my hand), the @C9 suggested that he had been dealt the @C8 as well. If Billy had not been dealt the @C8 (with @C9765 for example) he would have signaled with his 2nd highest club instead of the @C9. |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


ls|wc|hs|nc|hc|c2|nt|The declarer won the trick with dummy's @CK as I showed an odd number of clubs with my @C2. |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


lc|C2|ls|nc|pc|CK|pc|C2|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sh|hs|wh|at|A heart was led from the dummy and Billy took the declarer's @HK with his @HA. |

pg| ***** 37 ***** |


hs|ws|at|He continued by cashing his @SA |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


ls|ws|
pc|SA|pc|S6|hc|cq|at|and I discarded the @CQ (both to tell Billy more about my club holding and in an attempt to get out of my own way - you will see why soon). |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


lc|cq|pc|CQ|pc|S3|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


hs|ws|hs|ns|nt|Billy led a 3rd round of trump to deny the declarer a club ruff in the dummy |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


ls|ws|ls|ns|
pc|S4|pc|SQ|hc|d7|at|and I pitched an encouraging @D7. |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


lc|d7|pc|D7|hs|ss|at|South overtook the dummy's @SQ with her @SK |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


ls|ss|pc|SK|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


hs|ss|hs|ws|at|and drew Billy's last trump. |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


ls|ss|ls|ws|
pc|ST|pc|S7|pc|D4|hs|eh|hs|ec|hs|ed|at|I had to make another discard and, at this point, the deal becomes very complex. I am not going to go into all of the details, but the declarer can always prevail from here if she reads the position. |
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


ls|ec|ls|ed|nt|A heart discard was obviously out |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


ls|eh|hs|ec|at|and, while a (high) club discard may look "obvious", |
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


ls|ec|hs|ed|at|I thought I could make the declarer's life a little harder if I discarded another diamond. |
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


ls|ed|pc|D5|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


hs|sc|hs|ec|at|South led the @CA (a fatal mistake as it turns out) and I continued my unblocking (necessary for the defense to come out on top) by following suit with the @CJ.|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


ls|sc|ls|ec|pc|CA|pc|C5|pc|H5|pc|CJ|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


hs|ss|nt|The declarer was now in trouble, but she forced both Billy and myself to discard accurately when she found the good shot of leading her last trump. |
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


ls|ss|pc|S8|hs|wd|at|First Billy found the necessary diamond discard |
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


ls|wd|pc|D3|pc|H6|hc|ct|at|and then I made the necessary play of throwing away my @C10. |
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


lc|ct|pc|CT|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


hs|sh|at|South continued by cashing the @HQ |
pg| ***** 57 ***** |

pc|HQ|pc|H4|pc|H7|pc|HJ|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


hs|sh|at|before exiting with her @H3. |
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


ls|sh|pc|H3|hs|wd|nt|Once again Billy discarded accurately by pitching a diamond |
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


ls|wd|pc|D9|pc|H9|hs|eh|at|as I won the 3rd round of hearts. |
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


ls|eh|pc|HT|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


hs|ec|hs|wc|at|Thanks to all of my unblocking in clubs (which was a lot easier for me to do given Billy's early signal of the @C9), I was now able to exit with a low club to Billy. |
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


ls|ec|ls|wc|
pc|C4|pc|C6|pc|C7|pc|D6|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


hs|wc|hs|ed|at|We took the last 2 tricks with a winning club in Billy's hand and my @DA to beat 2@S by 1 trick. |mc|7|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


ls|wc|ls|ed|up|21|
hs|ed|hs|ec|nt|There are a lot of interesting variations to how the play of this deal could go from the point at which I had to select a minor suit discard on the 3rd round of spades. I am not going to describe these variations, but you will be able to do some experimenting on the next page. One thing to keep in mind is that the declarer could have succeeded from here against any defense.|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |
