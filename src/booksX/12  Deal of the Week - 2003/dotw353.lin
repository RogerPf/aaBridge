^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 353 - June 16, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
Regular and astute readers of ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N will have noticed that I have not written about any of the deals that I was involved in when I won the recent ^*BCavendish Invitational Pairs^*N (playing with ^*BBrad Moss^*N as my partner). Strangely enough, over the 5 sessions of bridge, despite playing against many of the best players in the world, there were no deals that we played that really were appropriate for this column.

I generally write about brilliant play and/or spectacular deals in ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N, but it seems that Brad and I won the 2003 Cavendish without doing anything really brilliant. I attribute our win to a combination of making few stupid mistakes, effective slam bidding, and some good luck (which is always important at IMP Pairs).

I found the deal that is featured this week to be one of the most interesting deals from the Cavendish, but it wasn't especially interesting when it was played at our table. When our opponents held the North-South cards on this deal, they stopped in a peaceful 4@H and ended up with an overtrick. 

At some tables the contract on this deal was 6@H. As you will see, 6@H was a very poor contract, but it was possible for declarer to win 12 tricks legitimately on the actual (very lucky) lie of the cards. See if you would have made 6@H. This deal has been rotated to make South the declarer.

hs|sh|nt|I am unable to construct a sensible auction to reach 6@H (which is understandable since 6@H is a terrible contract). Assume that you somehow end up as the declarer in 6@H |

pg| ***** 2 ***** |


sk||nt|OK - now that you have thought how you would play this deal as the declarer, you might want to consider how you can make 6@H against the actual layout of the East-West cards which is now shown above. You can assume you will receive the best defense - this is the Cavendish after all! Can you see a legitimate way to come to 12 tricks?|

ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|nd|hs|sd|at|and at least one certain loser in diamonds. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|ed|hs|ec|at|Your best chance is to hope that one of the defenders was dealt the doubleton @DK along with the @CK. In that case it may be possible to arrange for an endplay. |

hs|ed|at|By cashing the @DA early, you will make it more difficult for East to unblock his @DK from an original holding of @DK doubleton. On the actual layout, if East follows suit with his low diamond, you have a relatively easy route to 12 tricks. |

ls|nc|ls|ec|ls|sc|up|17|hs|ed|nt|This being the Cavendish, you can assume that East is made of sterner stuff. Despite your clever play of cashing the @DA early, he will unblock his @DK under the dummy's @DA. |

ls|nd|ls|sd|ls|Wd|hs|nc|hs|sc|hs|ec|at|and that East is sure to win a trick in clubs. Can you see any way to make your slam from here?|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|ls|ec|hs|ed|nt|While it is entirely possible that East was dealt a singleton @DK, of course, it is more likely that he still has a diamond left. |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


ls|ed|hs|ec|at|If this is the case then East is certain to have been dealt the @CK (since he would have no reason to throw away the @DK if he did not have the @CK). The inference about the position of the @CK gives the declarer a chance (without having to see all of the cards).|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


ls|ec|hs|eh|hs|wh|hs|nh|hs|sh|nt|It now becomes very reasonable for the declarer to draw 2 rounds of trump in his hand (which draws all of the outstanding trump on the actual layout), |

hs|wc|ls|ec|ls|nc|ls|sd|up|8|nt|If we back up to the moment of truth, we can see that the cashing the @DQ before playing a 2nd club is necessary when West was dealt a doubleton (or singleton) @C7 |

hs|sd|nt|I am sure you are dying to know if it is "right" to cash the @DQ at the critical point in the play. A fair bit of math is required to come up with the answer to this question (and I rate to get about 50 very long and boring e-mails from people attempting to do the necessary calculations). 
|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


nt|I have neither the time nor the desire to attempt to properly compute the odds of success of the 2 lines from this point, but both my instincts and some quick and dirty math suggest that it best for the declarer to not cash the @DQ before leading a 2nd club. All I can tell you for sure is that, in the Cavendish, it was very much in the declarer's best interest to cash the @DQ at this point!|
