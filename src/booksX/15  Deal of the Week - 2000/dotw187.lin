^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week #187 - April 10, 2000^*N }

This week's deal took place during the finals of the ^*BOrbis Bermuda Bowl^*N in January. Full coverage of this event, including ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N, is still available through:

The United States defeated Brazil by a wide margin in the Bermuda Bowl final, but this week's deal represented one of the high points for the Brazilians. This deal was played by ^*BRoberto Mello^*N and reported to us by ^*BBob Hamman^*N who, along with ^*BPaul Soloway^*N, had the misfortune of being Mello's opponents when this week's deal was played. Mello's partner was ^*BRicardo Janz^*N.

Both Mello and Janz have been mainstays of the Brazilian team for many years. Mello was a member of the Brazilian Team that won the 1989 Bermuda Bowl in Perth, Australia. As you will see from this week's deal, Mello is an outstanding technician as well as a great card reader. Thanks to Bob Hamman for sharing this deal with us. Hamman, the world's top ranked player, is an awfully good sport for sending us a deal in which he was squeezed once and then endplayed twice!

The ^*BGenerali World Masters Individual^*N will take place April 13-15 in Athens Greece. ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N will be representing Canada in this event. Full coverage of the ^*BGenerali^*N will be available through:

hs|nh|hs|es|hs|sc|nt|After Janz, North, dealt and opened 1@H, Hamman overcalled 1@S and Mello, South, bid 2@C. |

mb|P|mb|3S|mb|P|mb|4C|mb|P|mb|5C|hs|ns|hs|nc|ls|wd|at|Janz tried for game with 3@S and, when Mello retreated to 4@C, Janz raised him to 5@C. |

ls|ns|ls|sc|ls|nc|mb|P|mb|P|mb|D|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|at|Soloway offered a sporting double and 5@C doubled became the final contract.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


pc|H2|nt|Soloway selected the @H2, an obvious singleton, as his opening lead. Mello played the hand as if he could see all 52 cards so you might as well see them all too. Can you see how Mello was able to come to 11 tricks against any defense?|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sh|hs|eh|nt|Mello ducked the first trick in dummy and won Hamman's @H9 with his @HK. |

pg| ***** 7 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sc|hs|wc|at|Warned of the bad trump break by Soloway's double, Mello made the big play of a first round finesse of the @C9! If Mello had made the normal play in the club suit of cashing the @CA or @CQ first, he would not have made his contract.|

pc|CQ|pc|CJ|pc|D3|hs|es|hs|ed|hs|eh|at|Hamman was able to discard 2 spades and a diamond on the first 3 club tricks, but the fourth round of clubs subjected Hamman to an unusual 3-suit squeeze.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


hs|ss|hs|ns|ls|eh|ls|ed|nt|Another spade discard would make it easy for Mello to win his 11th tricks in the spade suit. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|ls|es|hs|eh|hs|nh|hs|sc|at|A heart discard was also out of the question as Mello would then be able to establish a heart trick by ruffing out the suit, using dummy's @SAK as entries. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sc|ls|eh|
hs|ed|at|Hamman was thus forced to discard a diamond. At the table he chose to discard the @D9, but, as we will see, it would not have helped him to discard the @DK instead.|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |

hs|nd|hs|sd|hs|ed|nt|Mello, reading the cards perfectly, exited in diamonds to Hamman's now singleton @DK. |

pg| ***** 19 ***** |


hs|eh|at|Hamman was now endplayed. He could not afford to exit in hearts (a low heart would give Mello his 11th trick at once and a high heart would set up a double ruffing finesse in that suit). |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


hs|es|ls|eh|at|It looked safe for Hamman to exit with the @SQ, but in doing so Hamman effectively set himself up to be endplayed a second time. |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |

pg| ***** 25 ***** |


ls|eh|pc|HJ|pc|H8|pc|D2|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


hs|es|hs|eh|at|and this time there was no escape. Whichever major suit Hamman elected to lead would give up a trick and allow Mello to make his contract. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


ls|eh|nt|Hamman could see that a heart exit would be fatal so he got out in spades in the hope that Soloway had been dealt the @S10. |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


ls|es|pc|S9|
hs|ss|at|Mello had that card, however, and he quickly put it up to win the trick. |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


ls|ss|pc|ST|pc|S6|pc|S4|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sd|at|Mello then claimed his doubled contract as dummy's @HA would provide a parking place for his remaining diamond loser.|mc|11|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sd|up|17|hs|ed|
nt|It is true that Hamman could have avoided this series of endplays by discarding his @DK (instead of the @D9) on the third round of clubs. |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |

pg| ***** 33 ***** |


at|Mello still could (and we are sure that we would) have made his contract had Hamman chosen this line of defense. Can you see how Mello can come to 11 tricks from this point?|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ws|nt|Mello could continue by cashing dummy's top spades, removing both of Soloway's cards in that suit. |
