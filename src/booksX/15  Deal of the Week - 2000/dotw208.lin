^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 208 - September 4, 2000^*N }
^-
The ^*BWorld Bridge Championships^*N are currently taking place in ^*BMaastricht, The Netherlands^*N. After a week of play the field in both the ^*BOpen^*N and the ^*BWomen's World Teams Olympiads^*N have been reduced to 16 teams. Full coverage of these championships, including ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N, is available through:

The Netherlands is a bridge player's paradise. The game is extremely popular in that country and is supported by both the government and the generosity of several major corporate sponsors. The Dutch have been known to host some of the best bridge tournaments in the world (including the yearly ^*BCap Gemini Pairs^*N and ^*BForbo Teams^*N) and it appears that ^*BMaastricht 2000^*N is following in the same tradition.

It is no surprise that both the Dutch Open and Women's Teams (the reigning World Champions) have qualified for the knockout stages of their respective Olympiads. This week's deal was played by Dutch Open Team member ^*BBauke Muller^*N in the 8th round of the qualifying stage. Bauke and partner ^*BWubbo De Boer^*N played for The Netherlands in 1993 when that country won the ^*BBermuda Bowl^*N. This long-standing partnership has also enjoyed many other successes in major events over the years.

Wubbo brings a great deal of natural flair at the table, but Bauke is a studious type who is well known for his precision as declarer. They are also our friends and we wish them continued success in the Olympiad!

hs|nc|hs|ed|hs|sh|nt|Wubbo opened 1@C as North and, after East overcalled 1@D, Bauke took a shot at 4@H. West doubled and 4@H doubled was the final contract.

The bidding was exactly the same when this deal was played at the other table (the play was not).|

nt|Believe it or not, Bauke still made his contract! He had some help from the defense, of course, but he certainly earned his success. Can you see what Bauke did to lead the defenders astray and how he then took advantage of their mistake?|

hs|es|at|From East's point of view it was entirely possible that the @D10 was an honest card. East knew very little about the distribution of the spades and diamonds around the table. He eventually chose to play a spade, hoping that the @SK would cash. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


ls|es|pc|s5|hs|ed|hs|sd|nt|Perhaps East should have figured out to continue diamonds (on the theory that West could have cashed a second spade trick himself if it was cashing), but Bauke's @D10 gave East a chance to go wrong. At the other table the defense began the same way, but South did not falsecard with the @D10. That made it easy for ^*BVincent Ramondt^*N and ^*BAnton Maas^*N to collect all of the their tricks and +300 for The Netherlands.|

ls|sd|ls|ed|nt|Bauke started out well by cashing the @HA and @HK, refusing to finesse in that suit. He correctly judged West's double made the @HQ a favorite to be on his left (and if East held the @HQ then it was probably not twice guarded). |

nt|Bauke's decision to finesse the @C10 would be an easier play to make if he was not doubled. Bauke knew that finessing the @C10 was his only chance for his contract, but he was going to give up a extra 200 point doubled undertrick if he was wrong. Bauke knew that the a priori odds of West being dealt both the @CQ and @CJ were roughly 3 to 1 against, but he suspected the IMP odds were in his favor.|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|Perhaps Bauke reasoned (incorrectly as it turned out) that 4@H doubled was not likely to be the final contract at the other table. 3@H down 1 for North-South and 3@S down at least 1 for East-West seemed more likely. If this was the case then the Dutch were already losing a sizable swing on the board and it would not be cost too many IMPs to go down an extra trick. |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt|Making 4@H doubled, however, would turn a the swing around completely. According to this reasoning there is so much more to be gained by the finesse of the @C10 than there is to be lost that this play becomes worth the risk. It may also be that Bauke read a "fear of clubs" into East's spade switch at trick 3. |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt|We don't know, of course, exactly what went on inside Bauke's head that led him to the winning decision on this deal. There is usually a lot going on inside this guy's head. The bottom line is that when Bauke Muller finishes thinking, the right card almost always appears on the table.|
