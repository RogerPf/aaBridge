^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 206 - August 21, 2000^*N }
^-
First of all let me apologize for the lateness of this ^*BDeal of the Week^*N (it is the first time we have been late in almost 4 years). The last few days have been really crazy for us and we simply have not had the time or energy to get ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N done. If you want to hear about the nature of the craziness read on. If you just want to see an interesting bridge hand click  the  ^$40  button on the toolbar below a few times.

I am ^*BFred Gitelman^*N, the author of ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N and the President of ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N I almost never write ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N in the first-person, but this week's deal is about me and my experiences at the recent ACBL North American Championships in Anaheim, California. Full coverage of this tournament, including ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N of the ^*BSpingold Final^*N (which I participated in), is available through:

Thanks to the ^*Bmany^*N people who phoned and e-mailed their congratulations for my success in Anaheim!

Getting to the last day of the Spingold was a pretty amazing experience. I was a member of the ^*BWelland^*N Team that was originally seeded 17th. Our Captain ^*BRoy Welland^*N of New York City deserves special credit. Roy had very little experience at this level and was playing in a new partnership (with ^*BMarc Jacobus^*N of Las Vegas). Roy and Mark played ^*Bvery^*N well against several of the best pairs in the world during the last few days of the tournament.

Our other teammates, ^*BMagnus Lindvquist^*N and ^*BPeter Fredin^*N of Sweden, are already widely recognized (and rightly so) as one of the world's top pairs. Brad and I have also had some success at this level, but Roy is new at this and was a big reason for our success in this event. Not only did our team play well as a team, but we also got along well. Everyone was supportive to one another throughout the event, regardless of the results (we all had our share of bad results of course). It was a real pleasure to play with these guys!

Our team was seeded 17th and had a very difficult draw. The first couple of rounds of the Spingold are supposed to be "easy" for the top teams, but we never had an easy match. On the first day we played a team of 2 young oriental pairs who had both come in the top 20 of the Life Master Pairs in the first week of the tournament. In the round of 64 we were very unlucky to face a very strong team that included Joey Silver-Debbie Rosenberg, Barry Rigal-Jeff Aker, and Michael Shuster-Joanna Stansby. In the round of 32 we met Brad's father, Mike Moss, playing with Bill Pollack and another top Swedish pair, Bjorn Fallenius and Johan Bennett.

Then things really got hard for us as we met the best team in the world in the round of 16. Nick Nickell-Dick Freeman, Eric Rodwell-Jeff Meckstroth, and Bob Hamman-Paul Soloway had won a remarkable 7 of the last 8 Spingolds (several of these with Bobby Wolff instead of Soloway). The round of 16 was the toughest that anyone could remember as the top 15 seeds in the event were all still alive at this point. Our team (who had beaten team 16 on the previous day) was the only exception. The strangeness of this did not go unnoticed and it occurred to me that perhaps we were a "team of destiny".

Beating the Nickell team after being down 26 IMPs at the half was my personal greatest moment in my bridge career. I have lost several times now in important events to these guys (including a Bermuda Bowl Final) and it was an amazing feeling to finally beat them. We took over the 1 seed, but the other 7 teams in the round of 8 were those seeded 2 through 8 originally. Everyone was saying it was the toughest Spingold ever and it was very exciting to be in the middle of the action!

Being the 1 seed didn't make the next day much easier as we had to face Richie Schwartz's team which included Zia Mahmood-Michael Rosenberg and David Berkowitz-Larry Cohen. The match was close at the half, but we won the 3rd quarter by 79(!) IMPs to win easily. In the semi-finals we played another great team, Americans George Jacobs and Ralph Katz playing with Italian stars Lauria-Versace and Bocci-Duboin. We led this match most of the way and survived a wild set of boards in the 4th quarter to win by 13. The Cinderalla Welland Team (that's what everyone was calling us) was in the final!

nt|Our opponents for the final were Rose Meltzer-Kyle Larson, Chip Martel-Lew Stansby, and Peter Weichsel-Alan Sontag. I thought we were going to win for sure. This was not out of any lack of respect for this fine team, but it just felt like our team was unstoppable.

It turned out that we were stoppable and the Meltzer team did not have much trouble stopping us. I am not sure why, but our team did not play well in the final. Our opponents, on the other hand, played very well. I was pretty happy with how I played in this match, but there was one deal that I failed in 3NT where I could have succeeded. I am still not sure if I "should" have made it or not. My head is still a little too groggy to do a proper analysis. That deal is presented as ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N.

It was very cool to come home and watch ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N of myself playing in the final through the ACBL web site. Unfortunately the ACBL made the mistake of switching Brad and I in the 4th quarter. I was actually East and Brad was West, but the ACBL had it the other way around. This turned out to be pretty embarassing for me as Brad had a rough session (not that his play affected the outcome of the match which was already out of reach). Hopefully ACBL will be more careful about this in the future.

The other big news from Anaheim was that ^*BBill Gates^*N came to the tournament and played in the ^*BMasters Mixed Teams^*N on a team that included my partner ^*BSheri Winestock^*N (and ^*BSharon Osberg^*N and ^*BHoward Weinstein^*N). Bill's team qualified for the Final which was quite an accomplishment given that this was Bill's first major tournament. I was originally supposed to be on this team (instead of Howard), but my unexpected long run in the Spingold made this impossible. Bill's presence in Anaheim has generated a great deal of positive publicity for bridge. Bill had a great time in Anaheim and I suspect that he will be playing in more tournaments in the future.
