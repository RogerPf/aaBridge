^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week #189 - April 24, 2000^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played by ^*BHuub Bertens^*N of the Netherlands during the recent ^*B14th Cap Gemini World Top Invitational^*N. Full coverage of the Cap Gemini, including ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N of every deal at every table, is still available through:

The Cap Gemini has been called ^*IThe Wimbeldon of bridge^*N for good reason - it is arguably the toughest pairs event in the world. The Cap Gemini is held every year in The Hague, The Netherlands and only 16 of the world's strongest pairs are invited. Bertens and partner ^*BBart Nab^*N have become a force in Dutch bridge in recent years.  Their 7th place finish at the 2000 Cap Gemini was very respectable. Bertens and Nab faced Bulgarians ^*BVladimir Mihov^*N and ^*BIvan Nanev^*N when this week's deal was played.

We are pleased to announce the opening of an Italian language version of this web site:

Do you play 2@D in this sequence as an artificial bid (like a Michaels cuebid, for example)? We, like Bertens and Nab, prefer to play 2@D as natural over a nebulous 1@D opening bid.|
