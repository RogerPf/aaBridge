The ACBL Summer North American Championships are currently taking place in Anaheim, California. Full coverage of this tournament, including ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N, is available through these web sites:

This week's deal was played by our good friend ^*BGeoff Hampson^*N on the first day of the Life Master Pairs in Anaheim. Geoff was playing with ^*BPerry Johnson^*N when this week's deal was played. The deal was reported by ^*BBarry Rigal^*N in Saturday's Daily Bulletin and has been rotated to make South the declarer.

Geoff Hampson (originally from Toronto, but now living in Los Angeles) is still in his early thirties, but in recent years he has established himself as one of the most successful players in North America. In our opinion Geoff and his regular partner, ^*BEric Greco^*N, are among the very best pairs in the world right now. Geoff has also had considerable success playing with other partners, including Perry Johnson. Geoff, Eric, and Perry were all members of the team that walked away with the ^*BCavendish Invitational Teams^*N earlier this year.

Thanks to the many people who made the effort to e-mail us their thoughts on the new "gray text" feature of the ^*BDeal of the Week^*N software. The response was overwhelmingly positive so it looks like the gray text is here to stay.

Many would prefer a 1@C opening, but we have a lot of sympathy for 1NT. There is no  clearly attractive rebid after 1@C-1@S. Also, opening 1NT has tactical advantages in making it harder for the opponents to get into the auction and to compete effectively.|

hs|nh|hs|sh|hs|es|hs|ws|hs|ed|hs|wd|nt|Geoff and Perry were already in a position to win most of the matchpoints on this deal. The opponents were certain to make either 3@S or 3@D and could win 10 tricks in either of those strains unless North-South found their heart ruff. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|ls|es|ls|ed|ls|wd|hs|ns|hs|ss|hs|sd|hs|nd|at|Furthermore, it looked like there was nothing to the play of 3@C. There were 2 diamond losers and 2 spade losers, given that West held the @SA sitting over Geoff's @SK.|

hs|ws|hs|ss|nt|Geoff correctly inferred that West was dealt the @SA as he presumed that East would have opened the bidding if he was dealt that card in addition to the @DA and @DK. Geoff knew that there was no technical chance to avoid 2 spade losers, but he came up with a brilliant swindle which resulted in an overtrick. Can you see how Geoff was able to trick the defense into letting him avoid 2 spade losers?|

hs|ss|hs|ws|at|If Geoff had been dealt the spade holding that West suspected then ducking the @SA would be necessary to ensure 2 more tricks for the defense. |

md|0h7s6,,,sqt|ls|ws|hs|ss|at|Geoff's actual spade holding was somewhat different than West was expecting, however. Geoff claimed his contract with an overtrick, conceding a spade trick to the defense.|mc|10|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


ls|ss|hs|eh|up|35|nt|Perhaps West should have figured out what was going on based on his partner's play of the @HQ on the third round of that suit (East wouldn't play the @HQ unless it was his last heart). In any case, Geoff certainly deserves full marks for giving the defense a chance to go wrong.|
