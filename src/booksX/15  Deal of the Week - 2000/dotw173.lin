This is a special Bermuda Bowl as it marks the 50th anniversary of this prestigious event. The World Bridge Federation wisely chose to hold this historic tournament at the place where it all started - in Bermuda.

This week's deal was played in 1975 during the 25th anniversary of the Bermuda Bowl (which was also held in Bermuda). This tournament included one of the most exciting and dramatic World Championship finals ever as Italy overcame a 78 IMP halftime deficit to defeat the United States by 25 IMPs over the 96-board final.

This week's deal helped contribute to Italy's amazing comeback. It was played by Giorgio Belladonna who, along with partner Benito Garozzo, formed one of greatest partnerships in the history of bridge. Their opponents, Americans Billy Eisenberg and Eddie Kantar, also deserve to be listed among the top pairs in history.|

nt|The final contract was 4@S by Belladonna (South). At the other table Hamman-Wolff, North-South for the United States, reasonably played in 3@D by North. Wolff, the declarer, wound up winning 12 tricks for +170 against less than perfect defense. Belladonna would win 6 IMPs for Italy if he could bring home 4@S, but lose 5 IMPs if 4@S failed.|

ls|nc|ls|ss|hs|nd|hs|sh|at|Belladonna, who had lost only 2 tricks, did not know spades were 3-3. He therefore played another diamond, discarding a heart, in an attempt to make his contract if spades were in fact 4-2.|

That was a well-played deal by Belladonna, but did you see the chance the defense missed?|

hs|nd|hs|sh|nt|Belladonna might well conclude that the spades were breaking 4-2. If so, he would continue playing dummy's diamonds to discard hearts from his hand. |

hs|ec|nt|This was really the only chance for the defense. If, for example, Eisenberg had returned a club (instead of a diamond) after winning the @HA (or if Eisenberg had ducked the @HA), Belladonna would not have been as seriously challenged.|
