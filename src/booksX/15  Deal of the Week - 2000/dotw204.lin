^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 204 - August 7, 2000^*N }
^-
There is a small but important change to the ^*BDeal of the Week^*N software and we need your feedback in order to know if we should stick with this change or not. The change is that text from "previous pages" will be displayed in gray instead of black. This is supposed to make it easier for the reader to follow the written text as the bidding and play advances.

Click the  ^$40  button on the toolbar below to go to the "next page".

at|You can now see the effect of the software change. The text you are reading now is in black and the text you just read is in gray. This change doesn't make much difference when a whole new paragraph is being displayed (as with here), but we think it makes the text much easier to read in other cases. We suspect that some readers, however, will find this change to be distracting. Let us know what you think so that we can make the right decision!

Any feedback on the Deal of the Week itself or the software design should be e-mailed to:

at|This week's deal is a declarer play problem that was sent to us by Poland's ^*BAndrzej Matuszewski^*N. ^*BAndrzej^*N is currently living in Mexico City and recently played a similar deal in a local duplicate (his partner was ^*BJorge Bouffier^*N). Thanks to ^*BAndrzej^*N, one of our more active correspondents, for sharing this deal with us.

If you would like to see one of your favorite deals appear as ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N, please send all of the relevant details to ^*BFred Gitelman^*N at the above e-mail address.

mb|1H|mb|2C|mb|3C|mb|P|
nt|We will start with a bidding problem. You, South, are the dealer with both sides vulnerable. You open 1@H, West overcalls 2@C, and your partner cuebids 3@C to suggest a limit raise or better in support of hearts. East passes and you must decide what to bid. Unfortunately you are not in a regular partnership.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||lb|*bWhat call would you make?^^3d|mb|3D|
hs|sd|nt|It is hard to say what the correct call really is. 3@S and 4@C both have a lot going for them as these bids are clear slam tries. 3@D would be very appealling if partner read this bid as a natural or help suit game try. Knowing partner's feelings about diamonds would definitely make your hand easier to bid. 3@S and 4@C do not exactly clue partner in that his diamond holding rates to be critical.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|The problem is that 3@D is the only bid available below 3@H. Perhaps 3@D ^*Ishould^*N just be a "general game try", not suggesting length in diamonds. What a bid "should" mean is not very helpful in the heat of battle - partner doesn't always see things the same way. We would expect diamond length for 3@D unless the partnership had a specific agreement to the contrary.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


mb|P|mb|4H|mb|P|
ls|sd|nt|Suppose you bid 3@D and your partner jumps to 4@H. Assuming your partner read your 3@D bid as "forward going with diamonds", he is likely to have a limit raise with a diamond fit. With more than a limit raise (or with a perfect fitting limit raise) partner would have cuebid on his way to game.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|These "limit raise of better" auctions can be very difficult because both partners are unlimited and must give each other space for possible slam tries. At the same time, opener cannot afford to cuebid on every hand that would accept a limit raise "just in case partner had slam interest". Even the most experienced partnerships have trouble with these auctions.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt|"Old fashioned" limit raises in competition with the cuebid reserved for a forcing raise works better than the "modern" style in this area. The modern style (where the cuebid is a limit raise or better and a jump raise is weak) has the advantage of allowing for a preemptive jump raise. We think the modern style is better because the auction is more likely to be "competitive" than "slammish" when the auction starts this way.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


mb|6H|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|
nt|We have been putting off the issue of what to bid over 4@H. 4@S is surely the correct technical bid. We don't think, however, you should ever stop below slam and it will be very hard to find out if partner has the right cards for a grand slam.  Bidding 6@H is certainly a practical shot (and avoids a likely tempo issue over 4@S-5@H). This is supposed to be a play problem in any case. Enough with the bidding.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||pc|CQ|
nt|West's opening lead is the @CQ and partner's dummy is not what you were hoping for. Perhaps your partner bid badly, but we have stopped thinking about the bidding. Think about how you would play as declarer. You can assume that West has 6 clubs for his overcall, but that East has the @CK given West's lead of the @CQ. West is therefore marked with the @DA and the @SK.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|nt|One of your primary goals is to play diamonds for 1 loser and the normal play in this suit is to start by leading low to dummy's @D10. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|ns|hs|ss|at|There will still be a spade loser, however, as that finesse is certain to fail. |

hs|nd|hs|sd|at|It is necessary to start the diamonds at a relatively early point in the play. If the @CA wins the first trick, you must then continue with a club ruff high followed by an immediate diamond play. |

hs|nc|nt|Leaving the @CA in dummy and ruffing the first trick high left some additional flexibility in the timing of the diamond suit. |

So you lead a low diamond towards dummy and West follows small. What card would you play from dummy?|
