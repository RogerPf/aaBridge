^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 220 - November 27, 2000^*N }

The ACBL Fall Nationals took place last week in Birmingham, Alabama. Full coverage of this tournament, including ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N of the Reisinger Final, is available through:

^*Be-bridge^*N, a new online bridge game, also provided extensive Birmingham coverage through:

This week's deal was played by Toronto's ^*BGeorge Mittelman^*N during the second qualifying session of the Open Board-A-Match Teams in Birmingham. George and partner ^*BPeter Nagy^*N were part of ^*BGeorge Jacobs'^*N team which finished a strong third in this tough event.

George and ^*BDianna Gordon^*N are the only Canadians to ever win a Gold Medal in a World Championship (the 1982 World Mixed Pairs). George played for several years with ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N. This partnership enjoyed many successes including a Silver Medal in the 1995 Bermuda Bowl - Canada's best ever finish in an open team World Championship.

As you will see from this week's deal, George is a very natural card player. His ability to win a lot of tricks (along with his excellent judgement in competitive auctions) has helped to make George one of the best board-a-match players there is. George has had numerous successes over the years in the 2 board-a-match events (the Open and the Reisinger) at the ACBL Fall Nationals.

Before we get into this week's deal, here is an interesting opening lead problem:

|cs|3|at|^C{|ih|pskth65cj6djt98742|at|}     |cs|1|at|{|ia|   2np3hp3sp4hp4sppp|at|}


You are sitting West with the above hand. South's 2NT opening showed 20-21 HCP. North's 3@H was a Jacoby transfer to 3@S. His 4@H followup showed 5-5 in the majors and asked South to choose a final contract of either 4@H or 4@S. North chose 4@S leaving you on lead. What card would you select as your opening lead?

|cq|4|lb|*CWhat would you lead?^^c6^skth65cj6djt98742|

hc|c6|at|We think the @C6 is the percentage lead! Leading a minor seems clear and the dummy is much more likely to be short in diamonds than in clubs. The @C6 is better than the @CJ in case dummy has the @CQx and the declarer has the @CA and @C10. If this is the layout of the club suit, then leading the @CJ will make things easy for declarer while the @C6 will leave declarer with a guess.|

nt|Back to this week's deal -- George was the declarer in 3NT and received the opening lead of the @D5 (4th best) from West. |

ls|nc|ls|sc|at|Overtricks are extremely important at board-a-match scoring. Before reading on, think about how you would play as declarer to try to come to an 11th trick. |

at|West followed suit to both of these tricks while East discarded a spade on the third round of diamond. |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


at|Can you figure out which cards the defenders have come down to and how you can win 3 more tricks from this point? Your opponents are experts and you can assume that they have discarded accurately.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


sk||hs|wh|hs|eh|nt|George thought it was strange that there had been only one heart discard (by West). He correctly inferred that both defenders were keeping their hearts for a reason - West must have still have @HQxx and East must be down to @H10xx (if East had discarded a heart at any point, George could have won a third heart trick by leading the @HJ through West).|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|wh|hs|ws|hs|es|nt|Since all of the diamonds and clubs in the deck had been played, George knew that both of the defenders had to have 2 spades left to fill out their 5 remaining cards. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


hs|ss|at|He therefore exited in spades, expecting that whichever defender won the second round would be endplayed into breaking the heart suit. |
