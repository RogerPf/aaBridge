bt||rh||ah|Deal of the|ah|Week #176|nt|The recent Orbis World Bridge Championships in Bermuda brought good news and bad news for Bridge Base Inc. The bad news was that Canada's Bermuda Bowl Team (which included Bridge Base Inc. President Fred Gitelman) finished near the bottom of the 20-team field, never threatening to qualify for the knockout stage.

Vice President Sheri Winestock's Canadian Venice Cup Team did much better. They qualified for the knockout stage, but lost to USA 1 in the quarter-finals.  Canada led by 43 IMPs at the halfway point of the 96-board match, but they could not hold the lead against the powerful USA team (who went on to win the Silver Medal, losing by less than 1 IMP to The Netherlands).

The best news we have to report from Bermuda is from the World Transnational Open Teams where Fred Gitelman and partner Brad Moss (along with Captain Reese Milner, Marc Jacobus, and Bobby Levin) lost a very close match in the finals (to Rose Meltzer, Cesary Balicki, Alan Sontag, Peter Weichsel, and Adam Zmudzinski). Fred has now come in second in 3 World Championship events.

This week's deal is a declarer play problem that Fred faced during the semi-finals of the Transnational Teams. The Milner Team faced the Bulgarian National Team when this week's deal was played. The young Bulgarians impressed many people in Bermuda. They narrowly missed qualifying for the knockout stage of the Bermuda Bowl and they won the round-robin stage of the Transnational Teams. Milner eventually won the 32-board semi-final 85-70 in a match that was decided on the last board.

Fred and Brad faced Vladimir Mihov and Ivan Nanev when this deal was played. The deal has been rotated to make South the declarer.|

ls|sd|pc|DQ|

nt|Mihov led the @DQ and Fred was not very happy with his contract. It looked like both 4@S and 5@C were better contracts than 3NT. Perhaps Brad should have rebid 3@S instead of 3@D. Perhaps Fred should have bid 4@C or 3@S at his 3rd turn. Perhaps you can't always get to the best contract... The Bulgarian North-South pair at the other table did well to bid to 4@S with these cards.|

Meanwhile there is nothing you can do about the contract anymore. Think about how you would play 3NT before reading on. |
