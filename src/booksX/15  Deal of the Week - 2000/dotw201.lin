^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 201 - July 17, 2000^*N }
^-
The Netherlands and The United States Womans Teams met in the Final of the most recent Venice Cup, held in January 2000 in Bermuda. It was the closest World Championship Final in history with The Netherlands winning by just one quarter of an IMP! Both sides had been assessed penalties for slow play. Although all accepted The Netherlands as worthy World Champions, it seemed a shame that time penalties could help decide the winner of such a close and important match.

In a magnificent gesture of sportsmanship, the Dutch Team invited the Americans to a rematch, which took place last week in ****, The Netherlands. Full coverage of this match, including ^*Bonline vugraph^*N of all boards played, is available through:

This 180-board challenge match was close all the way with the United States holding on to win 424 IMPs to 405 IMPs. Don't be shocked at the number of IMPs scored. Both teams consisted of 6 players and, in order to let all of the players play all of the time, 3 tables were in play. One of these tables was designated the anchor table. Results from both of the other 2 tables were IMPed against the result from the anchor table. Roughly twice as many IMPs are scored in this sort of 3-table match than you would expect from a regular 2-table team match.

This week's deal took play in the seventh segment of the challenge match. The deal has been rotated to make South the declarer. There are several interesting ways the play could go on this deal and tough choices for both the declarer and the defense. This is a complex deal and mistakes were made (at least in a double dummy sense) at all 3 tables at which the deal was played.|

hs|nh|nt|In order to make the contract legitimately from this point, declarer must discard from the dummy. The principle of restricted choice suggests this play, but there are factors from the bidding to consider as well. |

pg| ***** 47 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|hs|wh|at|The effect of North's Pass was that it made a heart opening lead more attractive to Janice Molson who was sitting West for the United States at this table (versus a diamond that the other 2 Wests led having heard North bid 2@H). |

The are many interesting play sequences on this deal. The bottom line is that declarer can make 4@S against any defense. The best the defense can do is to force declarer to guess the club suit.|
