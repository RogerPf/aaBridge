ht|d|at|The Java applet that is used to display ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N is constantly being improved. The latest version is being used for the first time in this week's deal.

Most of the new features in the latest version of the applet are related to displaying text in all sorts of fancy ways. For example, it is now possible to put text in ^*Bbold^*N and ^*Iitalics^*N and it is now possible to display text in columns (as you can see from this display).

^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N, the company that developed the applet that is used to display ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N, is now willing to license this software for use on other web sites.

As you will see from this week's deal, the applet is also able to display some types of bridge presentations that you have not seen before. In fact, just about any type of bridge article, deal, or quiz can now be displayed using this applet.

This week's deal is actually not a deal at all. It is a presentation of a new bidding idea that we think you will find interesting. Very few of the past ^*BDeals of the Week^*N have been about bidding.

cs|1|at|The convention we are about to present was developed by ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President, ^*BFred Gitelman^*N and his regular partner ^*BBrad Moss^*N. It is entirely possible (if not likely) that somebody else has independently come up with this idea before, but to the best of our knowledge what you are about to read is an original idea.

{ ^*BWarning!!!^*N } @2We think this is a great idea, but we do not recommend adopting this convention in a casual partnership or if you are an inexperienced player. If you decide that you want to try out this convention make sure you discuss the followup auctions thoroughly with your regular partner. The same general advice should apply to ^*Iany^*N new convention that you want to adopt.

The 2@H rebid has a very wide range. The first hand is a minimum in terms of point count and it is possible that none of its high cards will be working. The second hand is a maximum in terms of high cards, all of which rate to be working (there are some nice intermediate cards in this hand as well). The wide range of responder's 2@H rebid will often give opener a very difficult guess as to whether or not he should move towards game.|

Opposite the first hand 2@H could easily fail. Opposite the second hand 6@C is a big favorite to come home. This uncertainty makes opener's choice of calls on the next round very difficult. The wide range of responder's 2@H preference is the reason for opener's dilemma.|

Hopefully you have been convinced that there really is a problem with the auction that we have been discussing. Here is the solution:
^m@3
|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


ht|e|cs|1|at|With a ^*Bconstructive preference^*N make the same 2@H bid that you would normally make:

^-{|ia| 1hp1sp2cp!2h|at|}
^- @1^n@2
|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


ht|e|at|With a ^*Bweak preference^*N bid 2@D as a transfer back to 2@H which you can then pass:

^-{|ia| 1hp1sp2cp!2dp2hpp|at|}
^-
@0
|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


at|In the first auction the opener will know that responder's hand is a maximum (roughly 8 to a bad 10 points). Opener can thus move towards game with some comfort if he has extra values.

The second auction is more complicated as the 2@D bid could be based on two different types of hands. 2@D shows ^*Beither^*N a minimum preference (less than 8 points) ^*Bor^*N a hand that would have bid 2@D as ^*Bfourth suit forcing^*N in the absense of this convention. Opener relays with 2@H and responder clarifies (passing with the weak hand and making a natural forcing bid with a fourth suit forcing hand).

|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |

There are 2 main problems with this convention:

{ 1. @2The auction can get complicated if the opener's hand is too good to play in 2@H opposite the weak preference. In this case opener is afraid to complete the relay to 2@H for fear that his partner could pass. Opener has to bid something besides 2@H and you will then need to have some special agreements about how to distinguish the weak hand from a genuine fourth suit forcing hand. }
@0
Fortunately, this problem is not very serious as it is extremely rare for the opener to be strong enough to have game interest opposite a weak preference given that he was unable to jump shift on the previous round of bidding. Still, it is possible that opener has a hand like this and you need an agreement to cover this possibility. One reasonable solution is to play that a return to 3@H shows the weak preference and that any other bid is natural and shows a fourth suit forcing type hand. Another possible solution is that if responder follows with the cheapest bid he is describing the weak preference and any other bid is natural with a fourth suit forcing type hand. Each of these solutions has its problems.

pg| ***** 15 ***** |


cs|2|
at|{ 2. @2When the responder has the fourth suit forcing type hand, the opener will almost always bid 2@H. The responder will thus be deprived of the information that he would normally receive over fourth suit forcing in the absense of this convention. } @0
Again this is not a very serious problem as the bidding will be at a low enough level that it should still be possible to have a good auction. On some hands this will actually be an advantage as the opener sometimes has no good bid in response to fourth suit forcing (for example with 2524 and no diamond stopper). When the opener is dealt this sort of hand he will be happy to be playing this convention as he will not have to distort his hand as he would in a normal fourth suit forcing sequence.

In our view the advantages that this convention brings far outweigh these disadvantages. Our experience, so far, seems to confirm this. In the year or so that we have used this convention we have had several triumphs and no disasters. We can thus recommend this convention with confidence to any serious partnership that is prepared to put in the necessary work. We will let you know in a future ^*BDeal of the Week^*N if our results with this convention start to get worse!

cs|1|3d|5|at|Unfortunately, there is only one other fourth suit forcing auction in which this type of structure fits well:
^m@3
|ht|j|cs|1|at|^-{|ia| 1dp1hp1sp!2d|at|}
^- @1^n@2
|
ht|j|at|^-{|ia| 1dp1hp1sp!2c|at|}

In the first auction responder's 2@D preference is constructive. In the second auction responder's 2@C is a relay to 2@D, showing either a weak preference or a normal fourth suit forcing type of hand.
