3d|5|rh||ah|Deal of the|ah|Week #224|
bt||nt||cs|1|at|
^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 224 - December 25, 2000^*N }
^-
|cs|3|at|^-{ ^*BSeasons Greetings to all of our bridge friends!^*N 
^*BFrom Fred Gitelman and Sheri Winestock at Bridge Base Inc.^*N }

^*BRobert Sheehan^*N, one of England's strongest players for many years and the bridge correspondent for ^*BThe London Times^*N, has recently come out with a terrific book that we think you will enjoy:

|cs|2|at|^-{ ^*BThe Big Game^*N }
^-
This book is a collection of many fascinating bridge deals and stories from ^*BTGR's Bridge Club^*N in London, arguably the strongest money bridge club on earth. Some of the world's best players, including ^*BBob Hamman^*N and ^*BZia Mahmood^*N, are often found at TGR's £100 game. At those stakes you had better be good (or very lucky) as it is possible to lose a small fortune in a matter of hours.

Rubber bridge has declined in popularity over the years and most of today's duplicate players know very little about what rubber bridge is all about. Sheehan's book starts with a clear explanation of the rules and tactics of rubber bridge and Chicago (the form of bridge that is played in the high stakes games at TGR's). Not only is this information interesting, but it also may prove useful if you ever find yourself playing bridge for money.

Acol (with very few conventions) is the system of choice at TGR's. Sheehan carefully explains the many Acol sequences that are presented in his book and how they differ from those of Standard American. Acol is one of the oldest bidding systems there is and there are good reasons why this system has withstood the test of time: Acol is natural, relatively simple, effective, and fun to play. North American players in particular, especially those interested in bidding theory, will really enjoy this aspect of ^*BThe Big Game^*N.

The beautiful deals and educational value of ^*BThe Big Game^*N are more than enough to make this book a winner, but the human aspects are what really makes this a special book. Sheehan is not just a top bridge player, he is also a fine writer and he does an excellent job of portraying the regulars at TGR's. Most of them are true experts, but even the lesser players are fascinating characters. They all come to life in ^*BThe Big Game^*N, giving the reader valuable insight into what being a high stakes money bridge player is all about.

^*BMichael Courtney^*N, originally from Australia and now living in London, is one of the most colorful characters at TGR's. Michael is a regular winner at TGR's and he has a fine tournament record, but it is not widely known that he is one of the most brilliant and creative players in the game today. Sheehan praised Michael as the best declarer he has seen in the past 5 years and as a player similar in temperment and style to the legendary ^*BIrving Rose^*N (the first manager of TGR's and the source of that club's name - ^*BT^*Nhe ^*BG^*Nreat ^*BR^*Nose).

This week's deal was played by Michael Courtney in a high stakes game at TGR's and is just one of many fascinating deals from Sheehan's ^*BThe Big Game^*N. We strongly suggest you get a copy of this book (published by ^*BFive Aces Books^*N and available through all major bridge supply houses).
