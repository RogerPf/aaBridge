^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 217 - November 6, 2000^*N }

|cs|1|at|{ ^*BThere are 2 deals of the week this week! WOOHOO! ^*N }
^-
Both deals are declarer play problems based on deals that took place in recent online bridge games. We are not certain of the best line of play in either problem, but our suggested lines illustrate interesting points of declarer play technique.

The first deal was inspired by a problem that took place on the ^*BMSN Gaming Zone^*N (www.zone.com). ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N was responsible for much of the design and development work of Zone bridge, a free service that is by far the most popular online bridge game today.

The second deal will be presented at the end of the analysis of the first deal. This problem was inspired by a recent deal on ^*BSwan Games Online^*N (www.swangames.com). This free site is a relative newcomer as far as online bridge sites go, but we like what we see. The Swan interface is nice to look at and is rich in features. The free software is very easy to download and install - it is definitely worth a look!

nt|You are the declarer in 3NT. |
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


pc|S6|hs|ns|at|West's opening lead is the @S6.

Before we discuss the play of this deal, what do you think of your partner's decision not to use Stayman despite holding 4 spades?|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|We think North's direct 3NT was very reasonable. North has a little something in every suit and knows that the partnership has close to 30 combined HCP. Experience suggests that 3NT will almost always be safe under these conditions (not on this layout!). Meanwhile, if a 4-4 spade fit exists, 4@S might fail on a bad trump break or if the defense can win some tricks with ruffs.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|We would not go as far as to say that 3NT was clearly the correct call on the North cards. Bidding Stayman is certainly not unreasonable and we suspect that many strong players would prefer this action. If North lacked the @S10 then 3NT would be close to clear in our view (as the possibility of losing several trumps tricks would be greatly increased).|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


ls|ns|nt|On this particular deal, bidding Stayman would not have made any difference to the final contract, but it might have resulted in a different opening lead. Think about how you would plan the play as declarer before reading on. Keep in mind that we have yet to find a line that we consider to be "definitively correct". We suggest you don't try to find one either (unless you have a lot of time to kill).|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


hc|sakhakdakca|nt|Despite the impressive combined high card count, there are only 7 top tricks (2 spades, 2 hearts, 2 diamonds, and the @CA). The North-South hands mesh badly, but there are hopes for extra tricks in all 4 suits.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


lc|sakhakdakca|hs|ns|nt|Here is the best line we have been able to come up with. First of all, don't play the @SJ or @S10 from dummy in the hope that East might err by covering with the @SQ. East probably doesn't have the @SQ and he probably would not cover even if he did have it (unless he has 1 or 2 spades in which case you will still be better off playing small from the dummy).|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


hs|ss|nt|As you will see, both of dummy's spade honors could prove valuable. Play small from the dummy and, after winning the first trick in hand, |

ls|nd|ls|sd|pc|D6|pc|DT|pc|DK|pc|D8|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


at|If the @DQ had dropped doubleton then the contract would be certain. |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|If West had discarded on the second round of diamonds, then the lead would be well placed to lead a diamond toward the @DJ in order to establish an 8th trick in that suit. You would have to depend on one of the other suits to supply a 9th trick. If East had discarded on the second round of diamonds you would be in some trouble and need some good luck to make 3NT.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|nt|In the more likely event that both defenders follow small to the second round of diamonds, lead a 3rd round to establish your 8th trick in that suit, but make sure to unblock the @DJ from hand to create a late dummy entry in diamonds. |

pg| ***** 19 ***** |


sk||hs|eh|hs|ec|at|When East started with @DQxx he will win the trick, but find himself endplayed in a strange way. |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|A heart or a club return will give you your 9th trick at once. |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|ec|md|0,h8,,s7|hs|es|hs|ns|hs|ws|
at|East's only possible safe exit card is in spades, but if East has a spade to lead then the defense will have to set up a spade winner in the dummy. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


ls|es|ls|ws|ls|ns|pc|s|pc|h|pc|sq|pc|s|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|sd|hs|nd|at|The diamond suit will provide an entry to the dummy to cash this spade winner (good thing you unblocked so carefully). |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


up|4|ls|ns|ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|eh|hs|ec|nt|That is one of the reasons we like this problem. Two thirds of the endplay (the heart and club aspects) are material in nature - they give up a trick at once in the suit led. |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|ec|hs|es|hs|ns|at|The spade aspect of the endplay is non-material in nature - it does not give up a trick directly. Instead, a spade return sets up a winner in that suit when you did not have the requisite entries to set it up and cash it yourself.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|es|up|16|md|0,s7,,h8|
hs|nd|hs|sd|hs|ed|nt|A more straightforward approach to this deal, simply taking the diamond finesse, would also succeed on the given lie of the cards. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


ls|ed|hs|wd|md|0,dq,,dt|at|The advantage of the recommended line is that the contract will also be assured when West was dealt the doubleton @DQ. Just taking the diamond finesse could lead to trouble in this layout.|

hs|wc|hs|nc|hs|Ec|nt|If West is able to gain the lead in diamonds, a club lead through dummy's @CQ will likely place the fate of the contract on the position of the @CK. If East has that card then 3NT will probably fail. The main danger on this deal was a club shift by West. The recommended line minimizes the chances that West will have a chance to play clubs before declarer's 9th trick is established. |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |

nt|We like the recommended line, but there are too many other reasonable ways to play this deal for us to say with any kind of conviction that our line is best. The complication of 4-1 diamond breaks as well as "avoidance issues" based on some 3-2 layouts of the diamond spots makes this deal just too complicated for a full analysis (at least for us).|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


ls|ed|ls|wd|md|1sak2hak32dq2cakt9,sqt98hqt98d876c87,sj6543h654dk43c32|sk|s|sv|n|mb|2c|an|Strong and artificial|mb|p|mb|2d|an|2@D=waiting, 2@H would be negative|
nt|Here is this week's second deal. Once again you have a balanced 23 HCP hand and open 2@C. Your partner bids 2@D. Your agreements are that 2@D is a "waiting bid", but that it promises game-forcing values. Partner would bid 2@H as an artificial "second negative" if he had a "really awful hand".|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|In recent years the 2@H negative convention has become very popular in North America. We like this convention very much, but we think it is important to define what constitutes a "really awful hand". Most partnerships seem to use a standard like "less than 4 HCP or "less than a Queen and 2 Jacks". We prefer another approach.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|The way we prefer to define 2@H negative is: "a hand that, over a 2NT rebid by opener, would either pass or transfer to 3 of a major and pass". Not only does this seem like a "natural" definition to us, there are some clear advantages to this approach (you will see one very shortly).|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


mb|p|mb|2n|an|22-23 balanced|mb|p|mb|3h|an|Transfer to spades|mb|p|sk|s|
nt|Over your 2NT rebid partner bids 3@H, a transfer to spades. You have a very nice hand for spades. Are you tempted to "super accept" in some way by bidding something other than the expected 3@S?|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt||
lb|*BWhat call do you make?^^3S|mb|3s|nt|We don't think you should bid anything other than 3@S. Yes, you do have a very nice hand for the bidding, perhaps an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10. You could indeed make 4@S opposite some very poor hands. You could, however, have a better hand for spades (by exchanging your hearts and spades, for example).
|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt|Knowing that partner is not going to pass 3@S (because of the recommended definition of 2@H negative) takes all the pressure off. You can wait until you have a hand that rates a 9 or a 10 out of 10 to super accept. This will also make it easier for partner to evaluate his hand for a possible slam regardless of whether you super accept or not.|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


mb|p|mb|3n|mb|p|nt|
Partner continues with 3NT, to give you a choice between 3NT and 4@S. What call would you make now? |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt||lb|*BWhat call would you make?^^4C|mb|4c|hs|sc|nt|You should bid 4@C, a clear cuebid in support of spades (we think 4@C should also suggest a trick source in clubs). In theory, partner's 3NT denied slam interest, but a slam is still very possible (opposite, say, the @SQ, @DK, and @CQ). Partner already knows you don't have the "best possible hand" for spades. Your 4@C bid lets him know that slam is still a possibility.|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


ls|sc|mb|p|mb|4s|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Apparently your 4@C did not excite partner. He signs off in 4@S which becomes the final contract. |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


pc|c8|at|West leads the @C8 against 4@S. |

ls|sc|pc|ca|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


at|Think about how you would play before reading on, but again be aware that we are not sure how you are supposed to play this hand.|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


hs|ss|nt|When ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President Fred Gitelman played this hand he chose to cash the @SA and @SK immediately. Some have suggested that playing on diamonds first would have been better, but to us the correct start is far from clear. |

nt|When East discarded the @DJ on the second round of spades, Fred started to regret that he had cashed his top spades at once. Assume that East has the @DA for his violent signal and that West has a doubleton club at most. How would you continue?|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


hs|ss|hs|ns|nt|It looked like there were still 10 easy tricks (4 spades, 2 hearts, 1 diamond, and eventually 3 clubs). Fred realized, however, that if he played a third round of spades, the contract would be at risk. West would win the @SQ |

hs|ns|hs|Sc|nt|Fred would be unable to get to the dummy to draw West's last trump without destoying his third trick in clubs. It looked very much like the contract would fail from this point (and it would have failed on the actual layout against best defense).|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |

up|32|sk||ls|nd|ls|ss|hs|sc|nt|Fred was pretty pleased with himself at the time, but later realized that he had made a mistake.
