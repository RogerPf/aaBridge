This week's deal was played by ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President Fred Gitelman during the second qualifying session of the North American Swiss Teams. Fred and partner Brad Moss faced one of the world's top pairs, Chip Martel and Lew Stansby, when this week's deal was played. Chip and Lew's team ended up in second place in this event while Fred and Brad's team had to be content with a respectable 5th place finish. Fred and Brad had 2 other respectable results in Cincinatti. They came 4th in the Open Pairs and lost a close match in the round of 16 of the Vanderbilt.

This week's deal offers something on all aspect of bridge: bidding, opening lead, declarer play, and defense.

nt|Fred opened 1@H as South and Brad's 2@C response was a natural game force, suggesting at least a 5-card club suit. |
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


mb|P|mb|2D|mb|P|mb|3N|an|15-17 Balanced|at|Fred showed his second suit with 2@D and Brad's 3NT showed 15-17 HCP in a balanced hand without 3 hearts or 4 diamonds.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


mb|p|nt||lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^4D|mb|4D|
nt|Fred thought that 4@C and 4@D were both reasonable choices at this point. He was swayed towards 4@D by the relative quality of his minor suits. 4@C should not be considered a wrong answer and many experts would prefer that call to 4@D. Passing 3NT should be considered a wrong answer even though 3NT could be the best final contract. This hand has too much undisclosed offensive potential to pass 3NT.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


mb|P|mb|4H|mb|P|
nt|Brad tried to slow the auction down with a non-forcing 4@H, suggesting a non-spectacular hand that might play well with hearts as trump.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^6C|

nt|Fred chose to jump to 6@C in order to give Brad a choice of which small slam to play. Fred and Brad also use 5NT as a choice of slams in auctions like this one, but Fred thought that only 6@C would get the message of 3-card club support across to his partner. Fred was happy with how well he had been able to describe his hand and was confident that Brad would have enough information to select the best slam contract.|

pc|D8|

nt|Chip found the excellent lead of a trump. When the dummy came down Fred was pleased that Brad had understood the subtle inference of Fred's 4@D and 6@C bids. If you have to play a slam on these cards 6@D is clearly better than 6@C, but 6@D is still no bargin, especially given Chip's opening lead. Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on.|

nt||hs|nd|lb|*CWhat card did Fred play?^^DA^DAT|
ls|nd|nt|Fred won the first trick with dummy's @DA. He wanted to start playing hearts from the dummy and thought it would be a good idea to maintain some flexibility so that he could win the second round of trump in either hand. |

at|If you fancy your squeeze technique you might want to reconsider your plan at this point.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sc|nt|You need at least 3 club tricks to make the contract from this position. You should plan to take the club finesse and hope that either clubs are 3-2 or that some sort of squeeze develops in the event that Chip was dealt 4 clubs headed by the @CQ10.|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |

pg| ***** 27 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sh|nt|The 4-1 club break was a major setback, but the contract still had a chance. Fred could still get home with the help of a squeeze as long as Chip was dealt either the @SJ or the @HJ10. In order to preserve both of these chances Fred crossed to his hand in hearts |

hs|wh|hs|wc|hs|sd|sk||nt|Here are the remaining cards as they were actually dealt. As you can see, Chip was squeezed in hearts and clubs when Fred played his last trump. |

ls|sd|ls|wc|ls|wh|pc|DQ|
hs|wc|hs|nc|at|Chip could see that a club discard would set up Fred's 12th trick in the dummy. |

ls|sh|pc|H9|pc|CT|pc|C9|pc|H8|

at|Dummy's @CK was Fred's 12th trick and he was able to claim his vulnerable slam. Peter Weischel and Alan Sontag reasonably played 3NT as North-South at the other table so Fred and Brad's team won a large swing on this deal.|

pg| ***** 36 ***** |


up|20|
hs|sc|nt|Here was the actual position where Fred made the questionable play of cashing the @CA. Fred cashed the @CA in case Lew was dealt a singleton @CQ, but this play was not without risk. Can you see the downside in cashing the @CA at this point and the alternative line Fred might have taken?|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


md|0,sj,,hj|ls|sc|hs|ws|hs|eh|nt|Fred's line worked on the actual lie of the cards and would have also succeeded if Chip had been dealt the @SJ instead of one of his heart honors. On the above lie of the cards Lew guards hearts, but Fred's line would result in Chip being squeezed in spades and clubs.|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


md|0,h6,,sj|ls|ws|hs|wh|hs|es|

nt|Fred's line would have failed, however, with the heart honors split and the @SJ in Lew's hand. On this layout there is no simple squeeze present and the only chance for the contract (besides a strange play in the club suit) is a double squeeze.|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


ls|wh|ls|eh|ls|es|

ls|eh|hs|ns|at|A spade discard would establish dummy's @S10 as a winner |

pg| ***** 53 ***** |


up|16|hs|eh|hs|wh|ls|sh|nt|Taking the first round club finesse gains over cashing the @CA first in that it brings home the contract any time Chip was dealt 3334 distribution (unless Lew was dealt the singleton @CQ). |
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


md|0,hj,,h6|at|Fred's line would pick up the singleton @CQ in Lew's hand, but would fail against 4333 with Chip unless Chip's hearts were specifically the @HAJ10 (as they actually were at the table). |
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


md|0,sj,,hj|nt|Fred's line would also gain if Chip was dealt 4234 distribution with the @SJ. Taking the first round club finesse and then playing for a double squeeze would fail on the above layout (although seeing the @H10 discarded on the last trump might cause declarer to change his plan in midstream).|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


md|0,h6,,sj|

hs|sd|nt|Note that if the hearts are distributed such that a double squeeze is required, it is not strictly necessary to play clubs at all before playing the last trump. The double squeeze will still mature if the @DQ is cashing immediately. The problem with this line is that a club would have to be discarded from the dummy on the @DQ. The contract would then fail if the clubs turned out to be 3-2. It is surely best to test clubs before playing the last diamond.|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


ls|sd|ls|wh|ls|eh|md|0,hj,,h6|up|21|
hs|wh|nt|Suppose that Chip had decided to duck his @HA on the first round of hearts. |
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


ls|wh|pc|h|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


at|If Fred then crossed to the dummy in either trump or clubs for another heart play, the contract would have quickly failed (Chip would either win 2 heart tricks or give Lew a club ruff).|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sh|nt|If Fred was able to read the heart position, however, he would simply exit with a low heart. |
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|pc|h|pc|h|pc|h|pc|h|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


at|Chip would be forced to exit in diamonds and Fred would end up squeezing Chip as before. Assuming Fred would play in this way, Chip clearly made the right play in winning the @HA. His play gave the defense a chance if Lew had been dealt the @H9. This chance would be wasted if Chip had ducked his @HA.|
