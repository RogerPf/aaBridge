^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week #190 - May 1, 2000^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played by ^*BSue Ostrowski^*N during the semi-finals of the Flight A Knockout Teams at the recent Regional tournament in Hyannis, Mass. Sue and partner ^*BDarrell Gibson^*N, along with ^*BSheila Gabay^*N and ^*BRena Lieberman^*N, defeated the 1-seed in the semi-finals and went on to win the event. Sue and Darrell faced 2 of New England's finest, ^*BDoug Doub^*N and ^*BFrank Merblum^*N, when this week's deal was played.

We would like to thank Darrell for sending us this week's deal. If you would like to see one of your favorite deals appear as ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N please e-mail all of the details to:

Before we get into this week's deal, here is an interesting card combination for you to think about. The correct answer will be given in the introduction to the May 8 ^*BDeal of the Week^*N (please don't send us your answers by e-mail).

You are declarer in 5@C and have no losers outside the trump suit. Your trumps are:

|cs|3|at|^-{ @C^*B AQ108765^*N }
^-
Unfortunately the dummy is void in trump. After winning the opening lead you lay down the @CA and both defenders follow small. How do you continue?

After Doug opened 1@H as West and Frank, East, responded 1@S, Sue was faced with a bidding problem.|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


ls|wh|ls|es|nt||lb|*BWhat call did Sue make?^^p|
mb|p|hs|sd|nt|Sue chose to pass despite having enough high cards and enough diamonds for a 2@D overcall. We suspect that Sue would have overcalled had she been dealt stronger spot cards in her long suit. There is no right or wrong answer here. The requirements for a 2-level overcall are largely a matter of personal and partnership style. As you will see, Sue's judgement on this particular deal worked out just fine.|

Doug raised to 2@S, passed around to Sue.|

lb|*BWhat call did Sue make?^^3d|mb|3d|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|
hs|sd|nt|Sue wisely chose to balance with 3@D which became the final contract. As with all balancing situations, there was some risk associated with this call, but nowadays most good players go out of their way to balance when the opponents have shown a fit and stopped in 2 of a major. We like the way Sue bid her hand (and we ^*Blove^*N the way she played it!).|

hs|sd|at|Doug had found the most effective defense, making it impossible for Sue to execute either a ^*Bsimple squeeze^*N or a ^*Bdouble squeeze^*N. Sue demonstrated that her contract could still be made, however. The run of the diamonds produced a considerably more exotic end position - a ^*Bdouble guard squeeze^*N.|
