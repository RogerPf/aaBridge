^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 306 - July 22, 2002^*N
^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
This week's deal is a declarer play problem that was sent to me by my friend ^*BRoy Hughes^*N, a very fine bridge player from Toronto. As you will see from this week's deal, Roy is an excellent analyst. He saw this problem in a respected bridge publication and he disagreed with the solution that was presented. See what you think.

I have worked full time on bridge software since 1991. Before that I worked for 3 years for ^*BNetron Inc.^*N, a software company based in Toronto. Roy Hughes was my boss during much of that time.

Anyway, he has not been my boss for a long time so I don't have to say such nice things about Roy anymore, but Roy really deserves to have nice things said about him.|

at|How would you play from here? |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sh|nt|The main problem is that East's opening bid marks him with the @HA. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


ls|nh|hs|nc|at|North's 2 club winners will take care of 2 of South's hearts, but 2 heart losers will still remain. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


ls|sh|ls|nc|hs|nd|hs|sd|at|It appears that the diamond finesse will be required in order to come to 10 tricks (5 spades, 2 clubs, and 3 diamonds), but the dummy is depressingly low in the entry department. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|md|0,s9,,s3|hs|ns|hs|ss|hs|ws|sk||nt|The solution presented in the respected publication was for declarer to lead the @S2 for a first round finesse of the @S8! |

hs|nd|hs|nc|hs|sh|at|declarer is free to cash dummy's 3 winners in diamonds and clubs in order to discard 3 of his heart losers. |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|nd|hs|eh|mc|10|at|The defense will win a heart trick at the end, but the contract will succeed. |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|sh|at|There are 2 main flaws with the line of play that was just presented. Do you know what they are? |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


up|20|

hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|The most obvious flaw of this plan is that, when declarer leads the @S2 for a finesse of the @S8, |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|pc|s2|hs|ws|at|A clever West might play the @S9. |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |

pg| ***** 29 ***** |


ls|ns|pc|sk|pc|s3|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|at|the declarer is left with insufficient entries to both finesse in diamonds and to return to the dummy later. |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|up|3|hs|ws|nt|It should be admitted that plays like the @S9 from West's hand appear a lot more often as "what ifs" in bridge magazines than they do at the table. Almost all human Wests would follow small on the @S2. |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


ls|ws|pc|s5|md|0,s3,,s9|hs|ns|hs|es|at|The second flaw in the solution from the respected publication is more important - East might be able to win the @S9. It turns out that the spade finesse is an unnecessary risk. |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


ls|es|hs|ss|up|2|nt|Roy Hughes spotted a better line. Declarer should draw 3 rounds of trump ending in dummy, |

pg| ***** 41 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|ls|ed|
pc|D3|pc|D2|pc|DJ|pc|D7|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


hs|ss|at|South now plays his last trump which does some strange things to both of the defenders' hands. |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


ls|ss|pc|sa|hs|wd|hs|wh|nt|West is squeezed first. |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


ls|wd|at|He cannot bare his @HQ (a card you should know that he holds - East is known to have a balanced hand with the @HA, @DQ, and the @CAK yet he did not open 1NT). |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


ls|wh|pc|ht|hs|nd|hs|nh|at|If he does so you can discard whatever you want(!) from the dummy. |
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|nh|pc|da|pc|d9|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sh|hs|wh|Hs|eh|at|A heart lead will set up declarer's @HJ as his 10th trick. |
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


up|3|ls|wh|ls|nh|ls|eh|ls|sh|hs|wd|nt|Suppose then that West discards a diamond (instead of a heart) on the last round of trump. |
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


ls|wd|pc|D8|hs|nh|at|A heart is pitched from dummy |
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


ls|nh|pc|h6|hs|ed|hs|eh|at|and now East is squeezed. |
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


ls|eh|hs|nd|hs|sd|at|A diamond discard would allow declarer to overtake the @DK with dummy's @DA and score a trick with dummy's remaining small diamond. |
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|eh|ls|ed|nt|East therefore discards a heart to come down to a singleton @HA. |
pg| ***** 53 ***** |
