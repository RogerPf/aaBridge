^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 300 - June 10, 2002^*N
^*B300th Anniversary Edition^*N
^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }

|cs|1|at|^-{ ^*BSPECIAL!!! There are 2 Deals of the Week this week!^*N }
^-
Moving to a new city (let alone a new country) involves a lot of new things - new house, new friends, new bridge club. My wife and Vice President Sheri have experienced a lot of newness as a result of our recent move from Toronto to Las Vegas. Yesterday we played bridge for the first time at our new local bridge club, the ^*BDrawbridge^*N, which is located just a few miles from our new home. My partner was a new friend, ^*BJerry Weinstein^*N, while Sheri played with Jerry's wife ^*BSue^*N (one of the top woman players in the United States).

We have been in Las Vegas for only a little over a month, but various members of the bridge community here have really gone out of their way to make us feel welcome. We didn't know many people at the Drawbridge game, but our first experience at this club was a good one. The level of play was quite high for a club game. More important, the atmosphere at the club was excellent and the opponents that we faced were, for the most part, very pleasant both to us and to their partners. 

Both of this week's deals are near truimphs from my game with Jerry. You will see what I mean by "near triumphs" soon.

nt|On this week's first deal I was West. North opened 1@D and rebid 1NT over South's 1@S response. South's 3@H rebid was forcing to game and promised at least 5-5 in the majors. North jumped to 4@S to suggest 3-card spade support, but a poor hand for slam purposes. 4@S was the final contract. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


hs|wc|nt|I chose to start a club (the unbid suit) and, as Jerry and I had agreed to lead low from 3 small cards, the @C3 was the card that I selected for my opening lead. |

pc|S6|pc|D3|pc|D5|at|but declarer ruffed. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


pc|SJ|hs|ws|nt|After a few seconds thought, declarer led the @SJ out of her hand. Now would be a good time to think about your defense for the rest of this deal. Remember that this game is a pairs game and this looks like the sort of deal in which an overtrick will be worth a lot of matchpoints to the declarer. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ls|ws|hs|sh|hs|ss|sk||nt|At this point I was reasonably sure that there was no legitimate way to prevent declarer from winning 11 tricks. It appeared that South had been dealt 5503 distribution in a hand that include all the missing high honors in both major suits. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


ls|ss|hs|eh|ls|ws|hs|wh|hS|nh|hs|ns|at|Declarer would eventually ruff a heart in the dummy and, with that suit 3-3, 11 tricks would be easy. |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


ls|wh|ls|eh|ls|nh|ls|ns|nt|It seemed that my only chance was to find a way to deflect declarer from this line of play. I could see only one chance and this chance depended on declarer holding the @HAKJ9x. Can you see what I had in mind? |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


ls|sh|hs|ws|nt|I won my @SA |

ls|sh|
pc|HA|hs|wh|at|The play of the hand was going as I had been expecting. The time for my big play had come. I dropped the @HQ under the @HA in an attempt to create a losing option for declarer! |

ls|wh|pc|HQ|pc|H2|pc|H3|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


md|0,s9d2,,h8ht|hs|eh|hs|ws|hs|sh|hs|ns|
nt|Now look at things from declarer's points of view. If my @HQ was a true card then it would be dangerous for declarer to try to ruff a heart in the dummy as I rated to have the outstanding trump in this case and I would then be able to ruff the second round of hearts. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


md|0,h8ht,,s9d2|ls|ws|ls|sh|ls|eh|hs|ss|
hs|es|nt|I was hoping that declarer would buy into this illusion and draw Jerry's last trump. |

ls|ns|ls|ss|ls|es|pc|S7|pc|D7|pc|SQ|pc|S9|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sh|at|Taking the "marked" heart finesse against Jerry's "known" @H10 would then be a very reasonable play. |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|pc|H6|pc|H7|pc|H9|
hs|wh|at|I was very much looking forward to winning a trick with my @H10 to hold declarer to only 10 tricks, but my deception did not work out quite as I had intended... |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


ls|wh|up|7|ls|wh|md|0h5,,,h9|

hs|sh|hs|eh|nt|You see it was Jerry (and not declarer) who had been dealt the @H9. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


hs|wh|at|I am not sure whether declarer even considered that my @HQ might be a singleton. At the table she quickly cashed the @HK and, when both Jerry and I followed to this trick, |

ls|sh|ls|wh|ls|eh|pc|hk|pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|h7|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


hs|sh|hs|ns|at|declarer claimed the rest of the tricks for +450 (she would ruff a heart in dummy and later draw Jerry's last trump). |mc|10|

nt|Here is another deal from my game at the Drawbridge club with Jerry. I was the declarer in 3NT after East had made a weak jump overcall of 2@S over Jerry's 1@D opening. My 3NT call was not very brave, but Jerry had warned me that he sometimes opens light when he has a good suit and a distributional hand. |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt||pc|HA|
hs|nh|at|West's opening lead was the @HA (which gave me brief moment of anxiety). Jerry did have a light opening bid (to say the least!) as I had been hoping. Good news was that we had not missed a slam and that he had a heart stopper for me. Bad news was that 3NT was far from laydown. |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |

pc|H3|hs|nh|at|West exited with the @H3, an apparent suit preference signal for clubs (yuck!). I won dummy's @HJ |

ls|nh|pc|HJ|pc|C2|hs|sc|at|and East discarded a club (as did I). |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


ls|sc|pc|C5|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


hs|sc|hs|nc|nt|I was not about to take a club finesse into West's hand so I cashed the @CA and @CK with some hope that the @CQ would fall. |

pc|CT|pc|C6|pc|CA|pc|C4|at|Both defenders followed with small clubs on the first round of the suit. |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


pc|CK|pc|C7|hs|nd|at|I discarded a diamond from dummy on the second round of clubs (a spade pitch would be just as good). |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


ls|nd|pc|D2|pc|S8|at|I was disappointed, but not surprised, to see East discard (a spade) on this trick. |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


sk||hs|nd|hs|sd|hs|ed|hs|wd|
nt|I knew that East had 6 spades from the bidding and the early play revealed that East had been dealt 1 heart and 2 clubs. East was therefore marked with 4 diamonds. I could see a way to make my contract, but I would need West to hold the @DQ. My plan started with a finesse of the @DJ. |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|ls|ed|ls|wd|pc|D5|pc|D3|pc|DJ|pc|D6|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sc|nt|Assuming this won, I would cash the @DA and @DK, discarding clubs from my hand. |

hs|nd|hs|ed|hs|sc|at|I would then exit with dummy's last diamond and discard my remaining club. East would have to win this trick, |

ls|nd|ls|ed|ls|sc|
pc|D7|pc|DT|pc|CJ|pc|H6|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


hs|es|hs|ss|hs|ns|at|but he would then be endplayed into leading a spade away from his @SK. I would win 3 spade tricks in the endgame to make my contract. |mc|9|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|ls|es|up|13|

md|0,d6,,dq|hs|ed|nt|Unfortunately things did not go quite as I had hoped. East had been dealt the @DQ and my finesse of the @DJ lost to that card. |
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


ls|ed|pc|dq|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


hs|ed|hs|nd|at|The same endplay was now required in order to hold the undertricks to 1. East exited in diamonds to the dummy (a spade right away is no better). |

ls|ed|ls|nd|pc|dt|pc|c8|pc|d4|pc|da|

hs|nd|hs|ed|at|and surrendered the lead (and the setting trick) to East with the fourth round of diamonds. |

ls|nd|ls|ed|pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|cj|pc|h6|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


mc|8|hs|es|hs|ns|hs|ss|at|East was now endplayed into giving me a third spade trick, but the defense had won 5 tricks already. Jerry and I did not stay around to see the scores, but I suspect we did not win very many matchpoints on this board!|
