nt|In this week's deal neither side was vulnerable and Fred opened 2@S as South in third position. While Fred's spade suit was far from ideal for a weak 2-bid and his hand was strong enough for a 3rd position 1@S opening, Fred and Brad prefer to mix things up a little with preempts in this position. Bridge is a harder game when you don't know what to expect from the opponents.|

mb|D|mb|3H|an|Artificial invitation to 4@S|
nt|West doubled for takeout and Brad bid 3@H. Fred and Brad use transfers when they open with a major suit weak 2-bid and the next hand doubles for takeout. 2NT would show either long clubs or a spade raise with a lead direct in clubs. 3@C and 3@D would show the same thing with diamonds and hearts respectively. |
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|If Brad had bid 3@S instead of 3@H, then Fred would have had no rights to bid again, but Brad's 3@H bid brought Fred back into the game. 3@H carried the message, "I want to bid 4@S, but I am afraid to do so in case you have a really horrible hand" (it was well within the realm of possibility that Fred could have had a much worse hand for a 3rd seat non-vulnerable weak 2@S opening).|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|East passed and Fred had an easy 4@S bid as his hand was maximum, both in terms of high card strength and distribution. 4@S was the final contract. We don't recommend very many conventions in ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N, but this convention (transfers over doubles of weak 2s) has served us well. Standard disclaimer applies: discuss thoroughly with your regular partner before adopting!|mb|P|mb|4S|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|

hs|ns|at|West's opening lead was the @DA (Ace from Ace-King) and you can now see why Brad chose to use this convention. Brad knew that 4@S was very unlikly to make, but that it might be a good sacrifice if Fred had the right hand. Just bidding 4@S could be a disaster, however, if Fred held a 5-card spade suit and nothing special in terms of distribution.|

nt|Now suppose East really was dealt the @C108 doubleton. Just to make this problem a little (ok, a lot) more complicated, East should follow with the @C10 on the first round of the suit (or at least he should some of the time)! |

nt|Yes, this is a very interesting and complex club suit and we are not really sure what strategy declarer should adopt if East follows with either the @C10 or the @C8 on the first round of clubs. Fred was indeed lucky that a club layout existed such that the suit could be played for 1 loser, but he was also lucky that East chose to play the @C6 on the first round of the suit!|
