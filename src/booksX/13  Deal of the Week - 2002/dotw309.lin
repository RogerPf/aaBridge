^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 309 - August 12, 2002^*N
^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }

Regular readers of ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N know that I occasionally review new bridge books in this column. Apparently the people at ^*BCassell & Co.^*N, a British publisher, have noticed this because they keep sending me copies of books from their ^*BMaster Bridge Series^*N. Thanks!

Astute readers may have noticed that I never give a book a bad review. No, I am not being bribed by the publishers who send me these books. If I receive a copy of a book that I don't like, I prefer to not review it at all. Hopefully the people who send me books that I do review will get some good business as a result. About 10,000 people read each ^*BDeal of the Week^*N and another 500 or so get sent each ^*BDeal of the Week^*N by e-mail. If you would like to receive future ^*BDeals of the Week^*N by e-mail, please let me know by e-mailing me:

The first book that I reviewed from the ^*BMaster Bridge Series^*N was ^*IMasterpieces of Declarer Play^*N by ^*BJulian Pottage^*N. This week's deal was taken from another book in that series, ^*IBridge Over Troubled Waters^*N by ^*BDavid Bird^*N. So far I have been very impressed by both the content and the production quality of all of the books that I have seen in this series.

David Bird is perhaps best known for his stories about the Abbot and the other bridge playing monks of St. Titus. In my opinion, David Bird is the only bridge author other than the great ^*BVictor Mollo^*N who does a good job of writing about humorous characters playing bridge.

nt|^*IBridge Over Troubled Waters^*N is a series of 11 short stories that take place on a cruise ship (the King Harald III) through the South Pacific. The main character in these stories is ^*BRupert Knight^*N, the ship's bridge director. Knight is in some ways similar to Bird's Abbot character - he is capable of brilliance, but he is often shown up at the table by the other characters that he faces.

Bird does an excellent job in developing the characters of Knight and his supporting cast. The stories themselves are highly entertaining. I have always enjoyed Bird's unusual sense of humor and this book is no exception.

If you have read anything by David Bird in the past, it will not surprise you to learn that ^*IBridge Over Troubled Waters^*N is packed with fascinating bridge deals. Many of these contain complex squeeze endings, but there are also a lot of deals in which the solution is elegantly simple, but unintuitive at the same time. This week's deal is an example of this theme.

The bottom line is that I found the bridge, the stories, and the quality of the writing in ^*IBridge Over Troubled Waters^*N to be first rate. This is not a book for beginners, but I suspect that most players of at least intermediate level would really enjoy David Bird's latest effort.

If you have written or published a book that you would like to see reviewed in ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N, please send a copy to this address:

nt|This week's deal was taken from the story entitled ^*ITemple of the Breeze^*N from ^*IBridge Over Troubled Waters^*N. The story takes place when the King Harald III has docked in Osaka, Japan. Knight's partner's was Ikonishi, a Shinto priest who had studied bridge for over 50 years. Their opponents were Mark Rufus and Jonathan Parker, 2 of the best players on the cruise. |

ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|nh|hs|sh|at|In order for the contract to have a chance, he would need trumps to break 3-2 |

ls|nh|ls|sh|hs|ns|hs|ss|at|and he would have to play the spade suit for 1 loser. |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


at|He would need to find the @SQ with Parker, but it appeared that only a doubleton @SQ would give declarer a chance due to lack of entries to the dummy. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt|At first glance it looks right to take a spade finesse now in the hope that Parker had been dealt a doubleton @SQ. Ikonishi found a better line that would allow him to make the contract on layouts in which the @SQ was twice guarded. Can you see how he played?|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |

up|47|nt|After the hand Rufus exclaimed, "That was amazing, I think you found the only way to make it. If you play a spade from dummy at trick 3, I can exit safely in clubs when I take the second diamond." Ikonishi smiled and said, "An example of lateral thinking. With only 1 entry to dummy available, and 2 required, it was necessary to waste the first entry."|
