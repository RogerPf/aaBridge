nt|This week's first deal was sent to me by San Francisco's ^*BLen Vishnevsky^*N. Len was playing with ^*BWill Watson^*N of San Mateo, California in a Sectional tournament in San Jose when this week's deal was played. Watch how Len, West, and Will, East, both contributed to a pretty defense to defeat a world class declarer's 3NT contract. |

sk|s|nt|This week's second deal was sent to me by ^*BFrank Ayer^*N who also contributed the deal used in the July 24, 2000 edition of ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N. Frank, a resident of Calgary, Canada, played this deal in the Open Pairs event of a recent Regional tournament in Helena, Montana. His partner when this week's deal was played was ^*BLenze Walker^*N who lives in Helena. |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


mb|1S|mb|P|mb|1N|an|Forcing|mb|D|mb|?|

nt|Frank opened 1@S as South and Lenze responded with 1NT, a 1-round force according to this partnership's agreements. East doubled to suggest a sound takeout double of spades and Frank had a decision to make. What call would you make in his position?|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|I would have redoubled to show a strong hand and to invite a penalty double from my partner. West would probably bid 2@H or 2@D and, if my partner could not double that, I would bid 3@C at my next opportunity. |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|If East had passed over 1NT, Frank's hand is just about strong enough for a game-forcing jump shift to 3@C. East's takeout double makes the South hand even stronger since, if any minor suit finesses are required, they now rate to be working. |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt|However, there is a strong case to be made for the meaning of 3@C to change once East makes a takeout double. The reason is that hands with a lot of high cards can redouble in this auction. The implication is that a jump shift should show at least 5-5 with 2 good suits, but that this call should be invitational (as opposed to forcing, which it would have been if East had passed). |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


mb|2C|nt|Frank chose neither 3@C nor my choice of redouble. He decided to go low with 2@C in the hope of finding out more information. He also thought that his 2@C might cause the opponents to misjudge the auction and that they might commit some kind of indiscretion as a result. |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


mb|P|mb|3S|mb|P|mb|4S|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|
at|Lenze rebid 3@S to show a 3-card limit raise and Frank went on to 4@S which became the final contract. |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt||pc|H7|hs|nh|nt|West's opening lead was the @H7. Think about how you would play this hand as declarer before reading on. Keep in mind that you are playing matchpoints so overtricks are important (especially since it appears that any declarers who play in hearts will probably find a way to win 11 tricks). |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|Frank started well by refusing to take the heart finesse. The bidding marked the @HK with East. Frank knew that there was a good chance that the @H7 was a singleton and that, if this was the case, the defense would score a ruff if he finessed at trick 1. |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |

pg| ***** 49 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|at|Given that Frank was in the dummy for the last time, it looked like this was a good opportunity to lead a diamond toward his @DK. Frank rejected this play for 2 reasons. Do you know what they were? |
pg| ***** 50 ***** |

pg| ***** 54 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|ws|up|4|hs|nd|Hs|sd|at|Second, Frank saw a way to hold his diamond losers to 1 without having to play the suit himself. Can you see how he accomplished this?|

ls|ed|ls|sd|hs|nh|at|but it would not have helped East to hold on to a heart since dummy's remaining cards in that suit were high. |

up|43|at|It turns out that there is only one way for the declarer to come to 11 tricks after a heart opening lead on this deal. Frank found the exact play sequence that was required. Well done, Frank and thanks for sharing this deal with me!|
