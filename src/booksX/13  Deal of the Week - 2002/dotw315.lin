^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 315 - September 23, 2002^*N
^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
One of the side effects of there being a bridge World Championships every year is that there is also an annual ^*BWorld Championship Book^*N. Among other things, these books chronicle the play by play of all of the deals from the later rounds of the major events at each World Championships. There are 4 main reasons why I buy each World Championship Book soon after it is published:

1) I enjoy reading about what happened in these tournaments.

2) In my opinion, if you have serious aspirations about ever winning a World Championship, it is very useful to study how other players manage to win these events.

3) These books are important to bridge because they represent the only records of our World Championships that are maintained. The World Championship Books do not sell very well, however, and I believe that serious players should buy these books in order to help ensure that they will continue to be produced.

4) ^*BEric Kokish^*N is my favorite bridge writer and he has been one of the major contributors to all of the World Championship books for many years.

Eric Kokish is a man who wears many hats in the bridge world. Much to his credit, he wears them all with excellence. Besides being a great writer, Eric is one of the leading bidding theorists of our time. He is also arguably the most successful bridge coach in the history of our game.

I have had the good fortune to have been involved in Eric's coaching program myself. This (along with a lot of mentoring from Eric over the years) has in no small way contributed to the tournament success that I have had.

I was also a teammate (and occasional partner) of Eric's during most of my formative years as a player. Our Canadian teams had some truimphs (notably our Silver Medal in the 1995 Bermuda Bowl), but, like all bridge teams, we had plenty of disappointing performances as well. I can say without any doubt, however, that win or lose, I have never had a teammate who played (and behaved) as consistently well as my good friend Eric Kokish.

During his work on each World Championship Book, Eric will typically seek my opinion on a deal or two. This week's deal, which was board 30 from the semi-finals of the recent ^*BRosenblum Cup^*N in Montreal, is one of those deals. The deal has been rotated to make South the declarer.

Eric asked several other experts (including ^*BBart Bramley^*N, ^*BSami Kehela^*N, ^*BMike Lawrence^*N, ^*BJeff Meckstroth^*N, ^*BEric Rodwell^*N, ^*BJeff Rubens^*N and ^*BKit Woolsey^*N) how they thought the declarer should play on this deal. That's one impressive list of bridge players! The number of reasonable lines of play that were identified and the difficulty that these people had in deciding between them really illustrates what an amazingly difficult game bridge can be.

nt|Yes, bridge can be a very complicated game, but I am pleased to announce the release of a new educational software product by ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N that goes a long way toward simplifying and clarifying some aspects of the game.

The name of this product is ^*IPOINT SCHMOINTS!^*N and it is based on the best-selling book of the same name that was written by ^*BMarty Bergen^*N. This product is really intended for intermediate level players so if you are a regular reader of ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N (and regularly understand all of the deals) then ^*IPOINTS SCHMOINTS!^*N is probably too basic to be of interest to you. Still, you may have a friend who is a lesser bridge player than you are and Christmas is not that far away!

^*IPOINTS SCHMOINTS!^*N is filled with ^*Bpractical^*N advice on all aspects of bridge. Marty Bergen understands what it takes to win at bridge, having won 10 North American Championships himself. He is also a highly effective and entertaining writer. The book version of ^*IPOINTS SCHMOINTS!^*N is a past winner of the ^*BBridge Book of the Year^*N award that is presented by the ^*BAmerican Bridge Teachers' Association^*N. The software version is even more fun and effective than the book as the ^*IPOINTS SCHMOINTS!^*N CD-ROM is filled with highly graphical and interactive features that are not possible to have in a book.

If you appreciate ^*Bfree^*N online bridge content and services like ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N, ^*BBridge Base Online^*N, and ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N, you can support these efforts by purchasing our educational products!

nt|The bidding on this deal is worth an entire ^*BDeal of the Week^*N of its own, but I will not get involved in that here. The auction above did not take place in the World Championships. However, in a typical natural system, the bidding would go roughly as you see it. The final contract is 6@H and the opponents have passed throughout. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||pc|SQ|at|West's opening lead is the @SQ. Think about how you would play this hand as declarer before reading on. You should be warned that you are probably not going to figure this one out. Despite all of the feedback that we have heard from various top players, neither Eric nor myself are confident as to which of the several reasonable lines is best. Bridge is sometimes just too hard!|

ls|nd|ls|sd|ls|wd|up|27|nt|Well, ^*BMike Lawrence^*N, ^*BJeff Meckstroth^*N, and ^*BJeff Rubens^*N didn't see this as much of a problem. They all thought that the declarer's actual line was correct. Hopefully they have had second thoughts by now because, with all due respect, I am pretty sure you are wrong guys! |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|Here is a description of the line of play that I chose when Eric gave me this problem. I have no idea if this line is best, but I am quite certain that it is better than the line that was actually taken when this deal was played in Montreal. |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|sh|nt|Start by playing low from the dummy and ruffing in your hand. It is unlikely that the @SK will come into play regardless, but it certainly will not come into play if you waste it at trick 1! Trust me on this, in real life you do not see world class players leading Queens against slams when they were dealt the Ace in that suit.|

ls|ec|hs|nh|hs|sh|nt|Once the club finesse wins, you can draw the rest of the trump (if trumps are 4-1 you will need clubs to be 3-2). |

pg| ***** 37 ***** |


hs|es|hs|ed|mc|12|nt|On the assumption that East was dealt the @SA, you will make the rest of the tricks without having to guess the @DQ regardless of what East returns. It is worth repeating that this pretty endplay is not unique to my line. The same endplay operates when clubs are 4-1 and hearts are 3-2 in the line that the actual declarer took. |

hs|wc|nt|My line of play (which both ^*BBart Bramley^*N and ^*BKit Woolsey^*N supported to some extent) would not be a success if the first round finesse of the @CJ lost to the singleton @CQ with West, but that is the only layout in which my line loses and the simple line would succeed. |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


md|0,c3,,h6|nt|My line gains over the actual line on some not unlikely layouts in which the club finesse loses. |

pg| ***** 41 ***** |


hc|dq|hs|nd|hs|sd|at|In the simple line, if the declarer loses a finesse to the @CQ (after drawing trump and cashing the @CA), he will need to find the @DQ in order to make 6@H. Even if the declarer can make an informed guess as to the location of that card, he will still have to guess.|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|lc|dq|hs|eh|hs|wh|nt|When the club finesse loses in either line, you now need hearts to break 3-2 (since if hearts are 4-1, a spade return will spell certain defeat). When trumps are 3-2, however, |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


ls|wh|ls|eh|hs|ws|at|West may not realize that a spade return will be fatal for the defense. Even a world class defender sometimes will make the mistake of returning a spade in this position. |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


ls|ws|pc|s2|hs|sh|nt|If that happens, the contract is certain (presuming 3-2 clubs which are required in any event), on a dummy reversal. Ruff the spade in hand |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |

mc|12|hs|sd|hs|sc|at|The closed hand is now high. |
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


ls|sd|ls|sc|up|24|hs|ws|nt|So one of the advantages of my line of play is that, if the club finesse loses and West makes the mistake of returning a spade, the contract can be made without having to guess the @DQ. |
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


hs|wc|ls|ws|at|In addition, it may be possible to avoid the diamond guess if West finds the strongest defense of returning a club after winning the @CQ. |

pg| ***** 72 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|at|and hope that you can later guess the @DQ (or that East is caught in a spade-diamond show-up squeeze). My line does require a diamond guess in some circumstances, but it is not at all unlikely that my line will allow the declarer to avoid this guess.|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|up|27|

hs|nd|hs|sd|hs|wh|hs|wc|md|0,ht,,h6|nt|To summarize the analysis so far, I am quite certain that the line of play that I just presented is superior to that which the declarer took at the table. When the club finesse loses, my line gains by avoiding the diamond guess when either the @H10 is doubleton or when West makes the mistake of leading back a second round of spades after winning the @CQ. |
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


ls|wh|ls|wc|ls|nd|ls|sd|nt|^*BSami Kehela^*N, ^*BEric Rodwell^*N, and ^*BKit Woolsey^*N all came up with other interesting and unique lines of play for this deal. None of these even occurred to me. Due to considerations of my time, my sanity, and your sanity, I will not present their lines here. I will present one more line of play that both ^*BEric Kokish^*N and ^*BBart Bramley^*N thought was worthy of serious consideration.|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


nt|Before I do that, however, it should be pointed out that the only way to really solve a problem like this involves doing some pretty serious mathematical computations. Both Bart and Kit did attempt to do just that. I would certify both of these guys as geniuses, but neither of them were able to come up with any clearly definitive results. |
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


nt|In my view, the complexity of such computations and the difficulty of trying to factor in the chances of misdefense in various scenarios makes a problem like this essentially unsolvable. I am certain that there is no bridge player who has ever lived who could come close to solving this problem at the table. Of the players that I have mentioned, I doubt that any would really try.|
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


hs|sh|nt|Here is the idea behind the line that Eric Kokish, who contributed greatly to the lack of sleep in the expert bridge community in North America during the past couple of days, thought of. After ruffing West's spade opening lead in hand, |
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


ls|sh|pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|h3|

hq|dq|hs|nd|hs|sd|at|and try to guess the @DQ. |
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


nt|If you misguess the position of the @DQ then you will need to get lucky in clubs, but this line gains when you guess the diamonds correctly. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that you choose to play a diamond to dummy's @DJ and this wins the trick. |

pg| ***** 87 ***** |


nt|Of the roughly 7 reasonable lines of play that I have now seen for this hand, only Eric's line and a line chosen by ^*BSami Kehela^*N give the declarer a chance when the clubs are distributed as above (that is, when East has a singleton @C10 or @C9). |
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


nt|In Eric's line, once the @DQ has been guessed, the declarer can afford to play the @CK on the first round of the suit, noting the fall of the @C10 or @C9 from East. |
