This week's deal was played by ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N and is presented here as a play problem. Fred was playing with one of his favorite bridge partners, Montreal's ^*BJoey Silver^*N, when this week's deal was played.

nt|In this week's deal East dealt and opened 1@C, Fred passed as South, and West responded 1@D. |
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


mb|D|mb|P|
at|Joey, North, made a takeout double for the majors and East passed. What call do you think Fred made as South? Neither side is vulnerable, the game is IMPs, and your opponents are using a natural system based on strong 1NT openings and 5-card majors.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^2H|hs|sh|mb|2H|
nt|Fred chose to jump to 2@H. Although Fred had only 7 HCP, he knew that both the @SK and the @DA would be useful cards. His 5th trump was a huge plus value and he also liked his doubleton spade. 1@H is a bid that can be made here on a totally worthless hand (sometimes with only 3 hearts). Fred thought it was important to make a statement that he liked his hand.
|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|Devotees of the ^*BLaw of Total Tricks^*N might advocate jumping to 3@H (the correct Law-level) immediately. Fred and Joey sometimes use the Law to help them resolve close competitive decisions, but they do not base their bidding system on the Law. In their partnership, a jump to 3@H would be preemptive - a weak hand with a bad 6-card suit, inappropriate for a direct 2@H overcall.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


mb|3C|mb|3H|
nt|West competed with 3@C and Joey raised to 3@H (also competitive - Joey would have doubled again or bid 3@D if he wanted to make a game try). |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


mb|d|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|

at|East doubled for penalties in a quick and confident manner, and all passed. 3@H doubled was the final contract. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


ls|sh|pc|DJ|
at|West's opening lead was the @DJ (standard leads and carding). Think about how you would play before reading on. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|There is only 1 loser in spades |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|hs|nd|hs|sd|at|and there are no losers in diamonds. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|nc|hs|sc|at|It looks like it should be possible to hold the club losers to 1 (either with the @CA onside or by setting up the spades). |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|nh|hs|Sh|
at|You should therefore focus your attention on holding your heart losers to 2. That may not be easy as East's double strongly suggests that he was dealt all 4 outstanding trumps.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt|Assuming East has the @HKJ106, there are 3 natural trump losers and the only chance to make the contract is to arrange for some sort of trump endplay. The good news is that West's raise to 3@C was surely based on 4-card support. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|sk||hs|es|hs|eh|hs|ed|hs|ec|at|It is very likely that East was dealt exactly 3433 distribution and there are a couple of ways that you can succeed if this is the case. |

at|The time for the big play has come. Can you see what it is? |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|sh|at|It is vital to ruff a spade in the closed hand at this point, a very strange trump reduction play. Fred actually chose to ruff dummy's @SQ for aesthetic reasons (ruffing a winner to shorten one's trumps turns a normal trump coup into a grand coup!).|

pg| ***** 37 ***** |


up|12|ls|nh|ls|eh|hs|nc|nt|We are now back at the point where Fred made the critical play of ruffing a spade in his hand in order to shorten his trump holding. Watch what would have happened if Fred had cashed the @CQ (or the @SQ) instead of ruffing a spade. |

hs|nc|hs|sc|nt|Here is one final point of interest. We are still considering the line is which a club is led at trick 2, ducked by West, and a spade is led at trick 3, ducked by East. We stated that Fred would have to ruff a diamond in the dummy in order to make his contract from this point. Suppose that a club is led instead. Can you see how the defense can now come out on top? |
