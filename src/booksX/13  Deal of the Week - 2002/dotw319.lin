^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 319 - October 21, 2002^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
Regular readers of ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N will be familiar with the name ^*BGert-Jan Paulissen^*N whose exploits as declarer have appeared several times in this feature. This week's deal is another masterpiece that was played by my friend Gert-Jan in the recent ^*BModalfa Top 12^*N tournament in Amsterdam. The deal is presented as a declarer play problem.

In the last few years, Gert-Jan and his partner, ^*BBart Nab^*N, have established themselves as one of the very best pairs in The Netherlands. That says a great deal because, although The Netherlands is a small country in terms of area and population, it is one of the premier bridge-playing nations in the world. The Dutch take their bridge very seriously and that country has produced many fine partnerships and individual stars.

Each year 12 of the best pairs in The Netherlands are invited to play in the Modalfa Top 12 tournament. Gert-Jan and Bart won this year's Modalfa by a large margin and this week's deal is one of the reasons for their success in that event. 

I would like to thank ^*BJeroen Bruggeman^*N, another fine Dutch player who also played in this year's Modalfa tournament, for sending me this deal. If you would like to see one of your favorite deals appears as a future ^*BDeal of the Week^*N, please e-mail all the relevant details to:

nt|Both sides were vulnerable and West, the dealer, opened 1@S. Bart, North, doubled for takeout and East raised to 4@S. Gert-Jan, South, had a very nice hand! What call do you think he made? In case you think that the form of scoring might be relevant to this problem, the Modalfa Top 12 is scored using IMPs.|

pg| ***** 23 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|wc|hs|ws|hs|nd|at|and a spade return would yield a ruff and discard. |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sc|ls|ws|up|8|hs|sh|nt|Playing the @HA and another heart at the critical point looks attractive, but Gert-Jan found a good reason to reject this line of play. Do you know why Gert-Jan suspected that this line would not work and can you see the alternative line that he found? |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


ls|sh|hs|es|hs|eh|hs|ec|nt|Gert-Jan realized that the "normal" line would work only if East started with either 5413 or 5314 distribution. Given that East was vulnerable, that he was playing IMPs, and that he apparently had no Aces, Kings, or Queens, Gert-Jan thought that it was unlikely that East would jump all the way to 4@S unless he had been dealt more extreme distribution. |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


md|0,hjt9,,cjt9|nt|Gert-Jan deserves a lot of credit for drawing this inference especially since he happened to be correct! You can now see the actual layout of the East-West cards. Note that East was dealt a 5116 hand, making his 4@S bid more than reasonable. Can you see how Gert-Jan was able to come to 12 tricks on this layout of the defenders' hands?|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |
