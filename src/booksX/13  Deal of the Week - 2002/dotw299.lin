^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 299 - June 3, 2002^*N
^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }

|cs|2|at|^-{ ^*BSPECIAL!!! There are 2 Deals of the Week this week!^*N }
^-
Both deals were played at the recent ^*B2002 Junior Test^*N tournament held in Den Bosch, The Netherlands. In this tournament 4 of the world's strongest Junior Teams, Canada, The Netherlands, Norway, and the United States were invited to play a complete round robin of IMP matches over 3 days. The reigning World Junior Champions from the United States won the event in convincing fashion and were awarded the Carrousel Cup as their prize.

Complete coverage of the 2002 Junior Test, including ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N of every deal at every table, is available through the ^*BBridgePlaza^*N web site. If you click the green rectangle below you will be taken directly to this web site (which is one of my favorites) in a new browser window:

In several past ^*BDeals of the Week^*N I have asserted that The Netherlands is the best country in the world to play bridge in. Holland has the largest per capita bridge population of any country and the Dutch people seem to have a knack for running great tournaments and clubs. Every ^*BDeal of the Week^*N is translated into Dutch by my good friend ^*BLex De Groot^*N. Lex runs the ^*BBridge Base^*N office in Holland and he makes the Dutch version of each of our weekly deals available through:

Both of this week's deals are less less complex than your average ^*BDeal of the Week^*N, but we have been getting a lot of e-mail requests for simpler deals. Hopefully advanced readers of ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N will find these deals to be interesting, even though they are not as challenging as usual.

If you have any feedback as to what you would like to see in future ^*BDeals of the Week^*N (in terms of both level and content) please let me know by sending e-mail to:

|cs|1|at|^-{ ^*Bfred@@bridgebase.com^*N }

Here is a list of the upcoming live vugraph broadcasts that will be available through ^*BBridge Base Online^*N. The ^*BBridge Base Online^*N software and access to these broadcasts both are ^*B100% free^*N.

sk|s|nt|In this week's first deal, ^*BMaarten Schollaardt^*N of the Netherlands played in 4@S as South after opening 2NT in second seat. Maarten's partner, ^*BBas Drijver^*N, transferred to spades and offered a choice of games with 3NT. Maarten's 4@D was a nice bid that suggested a great hand with 3-card spade support and a source of tricks in diamonds. Bas signed off in 4@S. |

hs|es|hs|ws|up|43|ls|ns|nt|There was nothing particularly fancy about Maarten's play of this deal, but he did time things rather nicely in order to overcome the bad trump break.

hs|ss|sk|s|nt|In this week's second deal (also from the Netherlands versus Norway match of the 2002 Junior Test), a very good player got an "easy" hand wrong. See if you would have done better. West opened 1@C and South ended up as declarer in 4@S. I never include player names in ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N when an obvious mistake has been made. |

up|16|hs|nh|hs|sh|hs|wh|nt|Declarer could (and should) have avoided this fate by taking the heart finesse at the point in which he ruffed his club loser in the dummy. It is reasonable to assume that the heart finesse is working, not just because of the bidding, but because West would have switched to a heart earlier (and defeated the contract) if he had not been dealt the @HK.  |
