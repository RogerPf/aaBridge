East dealt and opened 3@D, presenting Anthony with a bidding problem. He did not want to pass (too strong) or double (too flat) |

pc|SK|at|West's opening lead was the @SK and Anthony's partner put down a sensational dummy ("bless him" as Anthony said in his e-mail to me). Think about how you would play this hand as declarer before reading on. |

hc|sahahkcq|nt|Anthony had won 3 tricks and he had 4 more top winners (the @SA, @HA, @HK and the @CQ). |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


lc|sahahkcq|hs|nh|hs|sh|at|He knew that he could come to an 8th trick in hearts without losing the lead as East (who was known to have 2 spades, 6 diamonds, and 4 clubs) was marked with a singleton or void in hearts. |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|Anthony realized, however, that losing a heart trick would not be such a bad thing (as long as he did not lose that trick to a singleton @HQ with East). Anthony found a neat way to make his contract regardless of what East's 13th card was. Can you figure out how he played? |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|Anthony made the very strong play of a heart to dummy's @HA |

nt|You can now experiment with how the play of this deal could go by clicking on the cards that you want to play for all 4 players. You might want to consider a diamond shift from West at trick 2. The
  ^$6  button on the toolbar below can be used to take back the last card that you played. When you are finished, click the  ^$40  button to go on to this week's second deal. |

sk|s|nt|On this week's second deal, East-West were vulnerable. ^*BGeoff Hampson^*N dealt and opened 1@D as South. West overcalled 1@S and ^*BEric Greco^*N, North, made a preemptive raise to 3@D. Geoff tried 3NT which became the final contract. |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


pc|SQ|nt|West's opening lead was the @SQ, suggesting a suit headed by the @SKQ10 and requesting that his partner play the @SJ if he had been dealt that card. |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


pc|S2|pc|S4|hs|ss|at|Obviously East was not dealt the @SJ, but he was dealt the @S4, presumably a singleton given West's 1@S overcall. Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on. |

pg| ***** 39 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|nc|hs|sc|at|Leading towards the @CK was the obvious road to trick 9, but West's vulnerable overcall made him a favorite to hold the @CA. |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


sk||hs|wc|at|Here is the actual layout of the East-West cards and, as you can now see, the @CA had been dealt to West. Can you see how Geoff was able to make his contract with all the cards in view?|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|Assuming that the @CA was wrong, Geoff realized that he was unlikely to have a legitimate play for his contract against best defense. |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|ls|wc|at|Under those circumstances it is a good idea to try to find a way to induce less than best defense and Geoff found a very pretty swindle that did just that. Can you see how Geoff talked the defense into helping him out? |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |
