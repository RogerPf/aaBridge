^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 327 - December 16, 2002^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
This week's deal was sent to me by my friend ^*BEugene Hung^*N. Eugene is a brilliant young man who is currently studying computer science at the University of California in San Diego. Between his talents for both bridge and computers, Eugene has helped me a great deal over the years in finding and fixing problems in the various software products that were created by my company.

Eugene played this week's deal in a matchpoint game on ^*BBridge Base Online^*N. Although he did not come up with the winning solution at the table, it did not take Eugene long to realize the possibilities that this deal presented. He thought that readers of ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N would enjoy this deal (I think he is right) so he sent it to me. Thanks Eugene!

^*BBridge Base Online^*N (^*BBBO^*N) is a ^*B100% free^*N online bridge service that was developed by my company. You can play various forms of online bridge through this site (including duplicate IMPs and matchpoints, rubber bridge, total points, mini-bridge, prepared lesson deals, and deals from major tournaments), but ^*BBBO^*N offers many other educational and social features that you will not find on any other online bridge site.

One of the most popular features of ^*BBBO^*N is the live broadcasts we present of major tournaments. Our next such broadcast will be on January 11th. We will be covering an exhibition match to mark the 75th anniversary of the Culbertson-Lenz match that is being presented by the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL). Thanks to the ACBL for making this broadcast possible! More details will appear in upcoming ^*BDeals of the Week^*N.

pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|Think about how you would continue as the declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|Let's think about what rates to be happening in each of the 4 suits. In the trump suit, East is likely to have at least 4 spades headed by the @SK and @SQ for his penalty double of 3@S. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|hs|nh|hs|sh|at|West should have a 7-card heart suit for his vulnerable jump to the 3-level, but there is a good chance that he does not have both the @HK and the @HQ since he did not lead that suit. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|hs|nc|hs|sc|nt|If West does not have both of the missing heart honors, then he is almost certain to have the @CA. If he did not have that card then he would not have much of a hand for a vulnerable 3@H overcall. |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|nd|at|In diamonds, all you really know is that East is likely to have both the @D9 and the @D8. If West was dealt either one of those cards he probably would have followed suit with it to the second trick. |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


ls|nd|sk||nt|Although none of the inferences just described is 100% reliable, there is a good chance that the outstanding cards are distributed something like what you now see above. When this deal was played on ^*BBridge Base Online^*N the East-West cards were in fact layed out like this. Can you see any way to come to 9 tricks with all of the cards in view?|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|es|hs|ss|nt|There is only one solution. You must start by taking a spade finesse (East must play low to give the defense any chance). |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|ls|es|pc|S4|pc|S3|pc|SJ|pc|S7|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


hs|sc|at|Lead the @CQ next (leading the @C2 would also work, but the @CQ play makes things a little more exciting). |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


ls|sc|pc|cq|hs|wc|at|West must duck his @CA (otherwise your heart loser will go away) |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


ls|wc|pc|C5|hs|nc|at|and you must now overtake your @CQ with dummy's @CK. |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


ls|nc|pc|CK|pc|C3|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|Can you see why it is so important to win the first round of clubs in the dummy? |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|ed|hs|ss|at|The answer is not immediately apparent, but it is neccessary to be in the dummy in order to take a double ruffing finesse against East's @D98. If you cannot see the relevance of this play, you will soon! |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|ed|ls|ss|
pc|D7|hs|ed|hs|ss|at|East must cover dummy's diamond and you win the trick by ruffing in the closed hand. |

ls|ed|ls|ec|hs|ss|nt|A trump return would allow you to avoid losing another trump trick. |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


ls|es|ls|ss|hs|ec|Hs|nc|hs|sh|at|If East returns a club then you could discard your remaining heart and lose only a trump trick at the end. |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


ls|ec|ls|nc|hs|ed|hs|nd|at|A low diamond return would also allow you to discard your heart loser so East's only (temporarily) safe exit card is his remaining high diamond. |

mc|9|hs|ed|hs|ec|hs|sh|hs|nd|hs|nc|nt|East will be down to 2 losing cards, one in diamonds and one in clubs. The dummy has winners in both of these suits so, regardless of which minor East chooses to lead, you can discard your heart loser to make your doubled contract. It is far from clear that this line is realistic with only 2 hands in view. My friend Eugene Hung can certainly be excused for failing to find it at the (online) table!|
