cp||at|: There was a time in which you would log in to BBO and there would be less than 20 people online - really :) chances were pretty good in those days that all 4 of us would be among those 20 players we have all been with BBO since day 1 and my opponents have been 2 of the very most important members on our site for many years.|

at|^^|cp||at|^a^*bRoland^*n|
cp||at|  needs no introduction for most of you I would guess since he is probably one of the most famous bridge players in the world Roland is the Howard Cosell (meant as a compliment) of bridge. His dedication to our game and to BBO vugraph in particular has made a LOT of bridge players happy over the years. I can't say enough about the great contributions Roland has made - if we gave out medals for service to bridge, then Roland would get a Gold for sure.|
at|^^|cp||at|^a|
at|^^|cp||at|^a^*bGerardo^*n|
cp||at|  is the man who makes sure that our servers stay up and running day and night. As I suspect most of you have realized, he does a sensational job - the amount of network problems we have is tiny compared to other online games (especially those with as many people as we have)|

at|^^|cp||at|^a^*bSheri^*n|
cp||at|  is my wife and she is prone to embarrassment so I won't say much in praise of her but I do have to say that without Sheri there would be no BBO - she does not get as much credit as she deserves :) and she is also a Life Master in the wife department -:).|

ht|e|cp||at|^a|
at|^^|cp||at|^aDuring this session I will try to "think aloud" hopefully you will get some sense as to what goes through the mind of a expert player when he is at the table a couple of things to look for:|
at|^^|cp||at|^a|
cs|1|at|^^|cs|1|cp||at|^a^-{1) I try to think about possible problems BEFORE they occur so that I can bid/play in tempo if and when the time comes}|
at|^^|cp||at|^a|
cs|1|at|^^|cs|1|cp||at|^a{2) More important, when I am playing or defending I am constantly counting the hands and trying to form a picture of what the other players have}^-|
at|^^|cp||at|^a|
at|^^|cp||at|^aThis is arguably the single most important skill that you need to master if you are to move beyond the intermediate stage to the players, sorry in advance if I seem to be playing slowly or if some of my chat->kibitzers goes to the table by mistake :)|

at|^^|cp||at|^aWhen I saw my hand I was anticipating doing a lot of bidding, but it may be that I never bid at all now! while it is possible that we should be playing the hand, Sheri's club preempt makes that somewhat unlikely but that depends partly on her style of preempting... just from a math point of view, it is unlikely we have a good fit in diamonds or hearts. |

at|^^|cp||at|^aSheri very likely has 7 clubs meaning she has an average of 2 cards in each of the other 3 suits, if she has secondary length (3 cards in this case) in any other suit it rates to be in spades - not one of my suits because I'm short in spades, she rates to be longer there.|

at|^^|cp||at|^aSo my judgment suggests that I forget about playing in a red suit - how about in clubs? suppose she has something like AQxxxxx or KQxxxxx of clubs - very likely holdings. We would then have 6 club tricks plus my @hAK-@dA that's 9 tricks and maybe one more is available in the wash. |

at|^^|cp||at|^aI won't DBL 3@s but I will DBL 4@s. OK I will go quietly - I'm guessing we are likely to beat this, but I am not confident enough to DBL, DBLing a partscore is dangerous business. If they go down 1 I gain 50 points by DBLing, but if they make I lose 300 points of so :) so you have to be careful when you DBL most partscores.|

at|^^|cp||at|^aI strongly suspect Sheri has 2 hearts at most, but she could have 109x still, I think I will take my club ruff (she has to have the @cA in our style) before I play more hearts I also know she likely has either 2 diamonds or a void :) if she had a singleton diamond she probably would have led that suit instead of hearts :). So I am guessing Roland has 6313 distribution :).|

at|^^|cp||at|^aNotice Roland's disciplined 3@s bid here - I am sure the thought of bidding 4@s crossed through his mind but I think his judgment was excellent. In a situation like this, it is practical bridge for Gerardo to play Roland to have something of value it is *possible* that Roland has a terrible hand with neither shape nor high cards, but it is not likely.|

at|^^|cp||at|^aI doubt Gerardo would have led a heart otherwise and on any other lead 6@s is easy Roland's DBL is not the sort of bid you would expect a beginner to find, but it is very instructive in my view. |

at|^^|cp||at|^aIt is "standard" among experts to use 3@s to say "do you have a spade stopper - I want you to bid 3NT if you do..." usually the 3@s bidder would have a long SOLID suit that being the case, our side will never want to play 3NT ourselves. So we can use the 3NT bid to mean "I have a strong hand for spades" - like a cuebid.|

cp||at|  I am obviously going to play on clubs which offers a good chance of producing 4 tricks. I still have chances if clubs break badly. Spades may be well placed this is a little annoying because I don't know how hearts are divided. The return of the 9 can be the only one Fred has or from J9x originally.If hearts are 5-3 which is quite possible I am in trouble if I play another club.|
