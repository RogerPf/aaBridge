cp||at|: It has been my distinguished honor to be your BBO Movie Maker for the past several years. This unique opportunity to re-enact Fred's teaching on BIL's eighth birthday is my crowning moment and my swan song. Several great men and women have assisted me in reporting this event as close to the live event as possible for which I am thankful. |

at|^b@2|ht|f|cp||at|^b^*bFred Gitelman^*n|
cp||at| is a leading American bridge player, as well as the co-founder, programmer, and President of Bridge Base Online. With a strong background in both computer science and bridge, Fred learned to program in BASIC when he was 12 years old and studied computer science at the University of Toronto.  Introduced to bridge at age 18, he was immediately captivated by the game. |
at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bConsidered one of the world's top bridge players, among his wins are the Gold Medal in the 2002 IOC Grand Prix and six North American Championships, including both the Rosenblum 2010 World Championship. In 2005, he was elected as the International Bridge Press Association's &##145;Personality of the Year.|
at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bAdditionally, he is well-known for the educational software he produces.  Funded by the American Contract Bridge League, he wrote Learn to Play Bridge, now studied by both beginners and intermediate players who want to learn the basics of the game.|
at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bIn 1992 he released the DOS version of Bridge Master, designed for players of all levels of ability.  Bridge Master is widely considered the greatest medium ever devised for learning declarer play technique and has been translated into several languages, including Dutch, Danish, French, German, and Italian. |
at|^^|cp||at|^b|
at|^^|cp||at|^bFor Fred, BBO is primarily a labor of love and, more importantly, a platform to promote the game of bridge throughout the world.  We thank him for his annual &##147;Think with Fred- teaching session and for the opportunity to present BIL Players with a very large classroom to learn the game. |

cp||at| There are those who would overcall 1@s with this hand, especially not vulnerable at Match Points. That is not really my style but I would not say it is a matter of right vs. wrong. If the opponents stop low (doesn't look like it will happen now!) I would consider balancing with 2@s. Generally in order to make a "light" overcall, I at least prefer to have a nice suit. If I had AQJ of spades and the same distribution with no other HCPs, I would overcall.|

Generally I am a big fan of leading the unbid suit (spades here) when not certain but there is a good chance that Sandy is short in spades (because she bid the other 3 suits). Still, it is not as if I have an attractive lead and maybe trumps are breaking badly - that suggests trying to force one or both of the hands to ruff. So a spade it is.|

Generally I am a big fan of leading the unbid suit (spades here) when not certain but there is a good chance that Sandy is short in spades (because she bid the other 3 suits). Still, it is not as if I have an attractive lead and maybe trumps are breaking badly - that suggests trying to force one or both of the hands to ruff. So a spade it is.|

cp||at| I can draw some inferences about declarer's distribution given that apparently he doesn't need 4 diamond tricks (because he overtook his own winner). It is kind of strange, because my queen of clubs suggests that declarer could have a club loser if he had 3 clubs and discarding 1 spade from an original holding of (say) xxx doesn't really help declarer - there is still a spade loser and no need to discard a spade at all if declarer has the King of spades. This all suggests declarer might have 2722 distribution, but hard to be certain of that - would not be surprised if I am wrong.|

cp||at| Well the 2 spades and 2 diamonds part is obviously right :). Now I know declarer started with 2524 - it all makes sense. That is why declarer didn't care about the third diamond winner - a club discard does him no good since he can always ruff a club in dummy.|

cp||at| Sandy - you should raise hearts immediately with your hand instead of bidding 3@c. The textbook bid is 4@h with your hand. The bidding sequence you used suggested an unbalanced hand - something like 1354 distribution. Both sequences show enough points to force to game. The difference is the distributional requirements. With 4-card support you should almost always raise immediately. That's all I have to say about this hand :).|

Because the alternative of a 3@c rebid would be game-forcing and you need roughly 19 HCPs to force to game opposite a simple response. Meanwhile, if I had about 10 HCPs, I would try to make some kind of encouraging bid. Perhaps by jumping to 3@d, raising to 3@c, or rebidding 2NT - all of these are invitational calls.|

cp||at| In classic Standard American, you should "never" rebid 1NT with a singleton. Most experts nowadays are more flexible than "never" but are only willing to rebid 1NT with a singleton as a last resort. Here there is a perfectly good alternative (2@c rebid) so no reason to rebid 1NT. |

cp||at| Hard to be specific zasanya - 19 HCP is generally enough, but with great distribution you can have less than that. Most important thing to keep in mind is that opener's jump shift rebid is FORCING TO GAME. With, say, AKQxxx of diamonds and AKxxx of clubs you have "only" 16 HCP but reasonable to force to game since you need so little from partner to give 5 of a minor a good play.|

And given that partner might have something like 3433 distribution, I don't think I should insist on clubs. I will bid a simple (Forcing) 2D for now, and see where that takes me. Hopefully the opponents bidding (or lack thereof) and partner's action will help me make an intelligent decision.|

cp||at| Sandy, about "losing trick count." The way I think about it is, it is a similarly useful tool to HCP count, the law of total tricks, etc. All of these methods of hand evaluation work well in some circumstances but all of them tend to be abused by those who believe in them. This hand is a good example. |

cp||at| Not in my view zasanya. For me DBL is a strong opinion that it is right to defend. With Qxx you have no idea. Pass means "I have no idea." So you should have a lot of strength in their trump suit to DBL in front of partner. Typically you need 2 honors and at least 1 sure trump trick. I suspect there would be more questions about this hand. It is a tricky one but let us move to the next board.|

cp||at| Hard to be too critical of East's choice of a diamond opening lead. "4th from your longest and strongest" has withstood the test of time. But with such a weak hand, there might be something to be said for trying to find partner's long suit. If that is what you are thinking, spades is your best bet.|

cp||at| Also note that it is likely that Patty has a good hand. I have only 4 HCPs, East is also a passed hand, and West's 2@c overcall puts some kind of a limit on her strength. So if I make a light raise, there is a good chance that partner (who raise to be strong) won't be able to take a joke!.|

cp||at| I could lead a spade in the hope of maybe getting a ruff eventually. But a forcing defense (i.e. making declarer ruff and eventually run out of trumps) is another possibility. Also, I know the opponents have at least 7 spades between them (since presumably partner doesn't have 5 spades). So declarer will eventually have to play spades for herself. After all said and done, a heart it is.|

cp||at| One thing you can see from this hand is that it would have been very wrong for me to either sit for partner's DBL of 2@c or to DBL 3@c myself. DBLing 3@c is really bad because, if it goes down 1 (not unlikely) I gain only 50 points (getting 100 instead of 50). But if it happens to make I lose 360 points (-470 instead of -110).|

cp||at| You have to be very careful about DBLing partscores, especially at IMPs or total points scoring. Also if you are vulnerable. Because you have more to gain there (200 instead of 100). Also more to lose (670 instead of 470). At Match Points it is different but still be careful please because if you are wrong you will very likely get a bottom board!|

cp||at| Possible I suppose, but my judgment suggested that unless Patty could act again herself. I would be better off trying to beat 3@c than to hope we could make 3H. Not sure I can explain it any better than that (sorry). Judgment is something you get from experience and the only way to get experience is to play a lot of hands! I have been playing a lot of hands every year for about 30 years now. So hopefully my judgment is pretty good about such things.|

cp||at| There is a good lesson in this hand that I get a chance to show you. I am going to open 1NT despite the less-than-ideal distribution. I will explain why in a minute. Had I  opened 1@c instead, it would be likely that my partner would respond 1S and I would then have a rebid problem. I am too strong for a 1NT rebid. My clubs are rather moth-eaten to rebid them and I am not strong enough to rebid 2@h (a reverse suggesting more HCPs than I have).|

cp||at| No bidding 2@s on 5 is perfectly fine. If Linda had passed, Patty would have transferred to spades and then passed. I don't think the fact Linda bid should really change much. Patty has enough to hope that 2@s will make even if I have only 2.|

cp||at| there is definitely a good case for Eileen to raise to 3@d, but I think she was unsure about whether or not 2D was conventional. Just about everyone seems to love to play a convention when the opponent opens 1NT and it is not as if my opponents had any time to discuss system or to make such agreements. |

cp||at| Normally no. I talked about that to the kibitzers partner which obviously you did not see. But the most important lesson of this hand is that my hand is a good hand to break the "no 2 doubletons" rule. Let me repeat what I said earlier: I have a tough rebid if I open 1@c and you respond 1@s. If my 4-card suit was spades it would be different. Then I have an easy 1@s rebid after a red suit response. And if you respond spades I can raise.|

Whether or not the 2@h rebid "promises" 6 is also a matter of agreement. In my preferred methods, the answer is no. 2@h on 5 is okay if you do not have a good alternative. But I would prefer a 2NT rebid with my partner's hand suggesting a balanced hand, only 5 hearts, and stoppers in the unbid suits.|

cp||at| Now to my partner. There is something to be said for ducking a diamond BEFORE drawing trump. As you saw your Ace of clubs entry to the dummy is vulnerable to attack. So even if the diamonds break you may not be able to get to them. But they can't really do anything about your Queen of trump entry. However the hand is a little more complex than that. As there is something to be said for playing clubs yourself early.|

cp||at| Maybe you will set up a club trick and, if not, maybe you will be able to ruff a club in the dummy. On the other hand, given Donnas's excellent opening lead I suspect that going after diamonds was your best play. A hard thing to learn is when to draw trumps because there are so many possible considerations. There are really no good rules available. But one time not to draw trump is when you know that you will need trumps for entries. This hand arguably falls into that category.|

cp||at| My decision to force to game was a bit aggressive but like the concept that "an opening bid opposite an opening bid should force to game." Therefore, if you play super-light opening bids, that concept has less value.|

cp||at| I would make the same 4@h bid (at least without prior discussion). Playing 2/1 GF, 2NT is certainly the right rebid with my partner's hand. Playing SAYC I am not so sure. I have to admit that I am not really familiar with all the ins and outs of such things in SAYC but I think 2NT rebid is supposed to show some extra values. I could easily be wrong about that.|

cp||at| But now it is hard for me to know what to do, partner has made a reverse (suggesting longer clubs than diamonds and extra HCPs). What to bid over a reverse is a different topic with no real "standard" answer as far as I can tell. For now I will rebid 2@h. Maybe partner has 3-card support. If not hopefully we can get out in 3@c. On the other hand, attempting to signoff in 3C myself (instead of bidding 2@h I mean) also seems very reasonable.|

cp|6|at| This is pretty hopeless - if I try to draw trump, even if I am lucky about the heart layout, the opponents will almost certainly be able to take a bunch of spade tricks. I am going to lead spades myself. That will either force them to let me ruff a spade in the dummy or force them to play trumps for me (which rates to be better than my playing trumps myself).|

cp||at| Okay, let's talk a bit about the bidding. "Reverses" are a scary topic for newish players and a difficult topic in general. Here the 2@d rebid was a "reverse" because diamonds is a higher-ranking suit than clubs. There is a bit more to it than that. 1@c-1@h-1@s is not a reverse even though spades is higher ranking than clubs. The 2@d bid is a reverse because it forces partner to go to the 3-level in order to support opener's first suit.|

cp||at| In "standard bidding" a reverse promises substantial extra values--about 17 HCPs--in high cards (or the equivalent in playing strength). My partner did not have enough to rebid 2@d. She would need roughly another King in order to have enough to reverse.  2@c is a better rebid with her actual hand.|

cp||at| Now what to do AFTER a reverse is much more difficult! For example, how does the responder attempt to signoff? With my hand some players would find my 2@h rebid to be normal while some would prefer 3@c (if that was non-forcing). And some play some kind of convention whereby either 2@s or 2NT is an artificial bid to say "I have a bad hand!"|

cp||at| In some parts of the world, the expert community favors opening 1@d with minimum hands and 4-5 in the minors so that you have a "prepared rebid." I am not a fan of that style of bidding but that does not mean I am "right." As I keep telling you there is a lot in bridge that is best discussed with partner (as opposed to being matters of right and wrong) even if what you decide is second best.|

cp||at| One is that you sometimes end up in a 4-2 fit :). For example, after 1@d-1major-2@c, partner would normally bid 2@d with a weak hand and 2-2 in the minors. My personal preference (a strong one given how strong the clubs are in the actual hand) is to open 1@c. 2@c rebid is fine, but I can also live with 1NT rebid (yes I know 2 doubletons). A hand like: void Axxx AKQx Jxxxx is an exception. With such strong diamonds and such weak clubs, I personally think it is the lesser of 2 evils to open 1D.|

Maureen's vision, still a work in progress, has offered beginners and intermediate players a &##145;safe haven' for learning and making friends for many years.|fp||

cp||at| In 2009 Sandy instigated and taught a series for Starter players which became known as Bridge 101 and gave rise to the program now referred to as the BIL's Beginning Bridge Program - a series of 4 preregistered courses taking the starter player through beginner and improving beginner levels. In addition Sandy has masterminded the Scribblers team (illustrated help for using BBO), the SET ( Special Events Team) can always  be relied on to help out.|

cp||at| (Kia) is our prolific Bridge Movie maker, The BIL Library's Nome collection numbers 330 movies. His crowning glory being the re-creation of Watson's famous Play of the Hand book ( Part 1) bringing the book alive and providing BIL members with an exceptional learning tool. He is taking time out now from the weekly grind, however we have reason to believe that work is continuing with Watson's Part 2.|
