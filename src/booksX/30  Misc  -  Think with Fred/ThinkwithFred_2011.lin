{               Fred Our Star               }
^-|cs||cp||ht|f|AT|^b@2^*BFred Gitelman^*N is a leading American bridge player, as well as the co-founder, programmer, and President of Bridge Base Online. With a strong background in both computer science and bridge, Fred learned to program in BASIC when he was 12 years old and studied computer science at the University of Toronto.  Introduced to bridge at age 18, he was immediately captivated by the game. 

Considered one of the world’s top bridge players, among his wins are the Gold Medal in the 2002 IOC Grand Prix and six North American Championships, including both the Rosenblum 2010 World Championship. In 2005, he was elected as the International Bridge Press Association's ‘Personality of the Year.

Additionally, he is well-known for the educational software he produces.  Funded by the American Contract Bridge League, he wrote Learn to Play Bridge, now studied by both beginners and intermediate players who want to learn the basics of the game.

In 1992 he released the DOS version of Bridge Master, designed for players of all levels of ability.  Bridge Master is widely considered the greatest medium ever devised for learning declarer play technique and has been translated into several languages, including Dutch, Danish, French, German, and Italian. 

For Fred, BBO is primarily a labor of love and, more importantly, a platform to promote the game of bridge throughout the world.  We thank him for his annual “Think with Fred” teaching session and for the opportunity to present BIL Players with a very large classroom to learn the game. |cp|8|at|

Movie Maker: |CP||AT|The Beginner Intermediate Lounge members are proud and privileged to have Fred as the star of the show on its 8th. birthday on August 28, 2011. Lime Goddess and favorite of Zeus has prepared this introduction.|

Fred: Maureen pretty much explained what you should expect. We are going to play several boards and I will try to describe my thinking process to you as we go along. During the play of the hands I will direct my chats only to the Kibitzers and at the end of the play the chats will go public. A couple of things to look for:
|HT|s|va|2|CS|6|at|^-{ when declarer or defender, I do a lot of thinking about counting the hand. If you do not know already that this 
is super-important in terms of advancing in bridge, you should.
 }|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


ht|u|AT|

{During the bidding I often try to visualize what my partner's hand looks like and from there think about how the
play might go in various contracts. Again this is an important skill to learn if you are going to become a strong player. 
 }^-|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


ht|x|va|8|AT|
Easier said than done - both of these skills take hard work and practice, but the more you practice the better you get at it and I can promise you it is worth the effort :). Anyway, let's hope the hands cooperate and that I have some good things to think about!|

Fred->Kibitzers:|cp||at| There are those who would overcall 1@S with this hand, especially not vulnerable at Match Points. That is not really my style but I would not say it is a matter of right vs. wrong. If the opponents stop low (doesn't look like it will happen now!) I would consider balancing with 2@S. Generally in order to make a "light" overcall, I at least prefer to have a nice suit. If I had AQJ of spades and the same distribution with no other HCPs, I would overcall.|

Fred->Kibitzers:|cp||at| What to lead? My sense is that it probably won't matter much what I lead given the opponents strong bidding. Generally I am a big fan of leading the unbid suit (spades here) when not certain but there is a good chance that Sandy is short in spades (because she bid the other 3 suits). Still, it is not as if I have an attractive lead and maybe trumps are breaking badly - that suggests trying to force one or both of the hands to ruff. So a spade it is.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |

pg| ***** 16 ***** |


pc|DJ|pc|D8|pc|DA|pc|D4|cp|8|at|
Fred->Kibitzers:|cp||at| I can draw some inferences about declarer's distribution given that apparently he doesn't need 4 diamond tricks (because he overtook his own winner). It is kind of strange, because my queen of clubs suggests that declarer could have a club loser if he had 3 clubs and discarding 1 spade from an original holding of (say) xxx doesn't really help declarer - there is still a spade loser and no need to discard a spade at all if declarer has the King of spades. This all suggests declarer might have 2722 distribution, but hard to be certain of that - would not be surprised if I am wrong.|

pc|DK|pc|D5|pc|S6|pc|DT|cp|8|at|
Fred->Kibitzers:|cp||at| Well the 2 spades and 2 diamonds part is obviously right :). Now I know declarer started with 2524 - it all makes sense. That is why declarer didn't care about the third diamond winner - a club discard does him no good since he can always ruff a club in dummy.|sk||

pg| ***** 25 ***** |


cp|8|at|
Fred:|cp||at| No you did the best you could Kia. Always a club loser and a heart loser. Let me address the bidding first.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|at|
Fred:|cp||at| Sandy - you should raise hearts immediately with your hand instead of bidding 3@C. The textbook bid is 4@H with your hand. The bidding sequence you used suggested an unbalanced hand - something like 1354 distribution. Both sequences show enough points to force to game. The difference is the distributional requirements. With 4-card support you should almost always raise immediately. That's all I have to say about this hand :).|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||at|
TwstofLime: Do you think one should show support for partner's suit right away?|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


cp|8|at|
Fred:|cp||at| With 18-19 balanced and 4-card support there are 3 schools of thought:
^C 1) always raise to 4
^C 2) always raise to 3
^C 3) judge between raising to 3 and raising to 4 based on the hand.
As far as I can tell, 1) is the mainstream approach in most of the world. Ideally it is something you should discuss with your partner. Most important thing is that you and your partner agree what to do with various types of hands :). |
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||at| 
msmaple: Would that be a shut out bid if East raises to 4?|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


cp|8|at|

Fred:|cp||at| Not a shutout bid - a descriptive. The responder should expect 18-19 balanced with 4-card support. If responder thinks slam is possible opposite such a hand, responder should bid on.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||AT|  
spinman: Could 3C or 3 of another suit be showing a singleton/void and support for hearts?|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


cp|8|at|
Fred:|cp||at| There is a nice convention known as "splinters" that can be used. In this case you double-jump in your singleton (to 3@S with the 1453 example). In general I do not like to recommend conventions to newish players. |CP|8|AT|Since I believe that most bridge teachers get far too involved in feeding conventions to their students. And many students gain the (false) impression that lots of conventions are important to good bridge.|CP||AT| But this particular convention (splinters) is a good one. However, like all conventions, it comes with a SERIOUS disclaimer: if you and your partner are not both comfortable with it and if either of you might forget you play it, then don't play it!|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT||at| 
gimit: Why did you say there is always a @s and a @c loser? If declarer plays the @DQJ (after removing trumps then he can discard 2 losers on the @DAK, right?|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


cp|8|at|
Fred:|cp||at| A club discard doesn't help declarer because he had 4 clubs - there is still a loser.|

Fred->Kibitzers:|cp||at| Not much to think about in the bidding here, but we can discuss later if you have any questions. I am hoping Mom will have some extra values and take another call since I have a near maximum hand for my bidding.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT||sk|S|mb|p|mb|2C|cp|8|at|
Fred->Kibitzers:|cp||at| Mom's 2C rebid has a very wide range - she has close to a minimum opening bid, but she could have up to 18 HCPs or so and still rebid 2C. Because the alternative of a 3@C rebid would be game-forcing and you need roughly 19 HCPs to force to game opposite a simple response. Meanwhile, if I had about 10 HCPs, I would try to make some kind of encouraging bid. Perhaps by jumping to 3@D, raising to 3@C, or rebidding 2NT - all of these are invitational calls.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


mb|p|sk|n|NT||cp|8|at|
Fred->Kibitzers:|CP||AT| So my hand, with 9 HCPs, is a maximum for my (non-invitational) bidding. If Mom is near the top of her range (say 16-18 HCP), she should take another bid after my 2@D|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


MB|2d|at|^*B as we could still have game. MANY newish players think that opener must do something violent with his rebid with (say) 17 HCPs and actually there are plenty of experienced players who never learn that this is wrong. Simple rebid of a new suit by opener (like Mom's 2@C here) does not deny a strong hand. it only denies the strength to force to game and you need a LOT to force to game, given that responder might have as few as 6 points.^*N|

PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||at|
wyoming33: Did you say that 3@C over 2@D is GF?|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
Fred:|CP||AT| In 1@D-1@S-3@C auction , 3@C is game-forcing. On the other hand, in 1@D-1@S-2@C-2@D-3@C auction, 3@C suggests at least 5-5 distribution and extra values (say 16-18 HCPs).|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT||at|
zasanya: Doesn't the opener's rebid depend on on your reverse strength? Isn't reverse generally 18+?|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


cp|8|at|

Fred:|cp||at| zasanya raises a good point about reverses because they sometimes come into play in auctions like this one depending on the specific suits. Here there is not a reverse available since Mom's 2nd suit (clubs) is lower ranking than her first suit--diamonds.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||at|
magpie15: Would a rebid of 1NT been wrong?|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


cp|8|at|

Fred:|CP||AT| In classic Standard American, you should "never" rebid 1NT with a singleton. Most experts nowadays are more flexible than "never" but are only willing to rebid 1NT with a singleton as a last resort. Here there is a perfectly good alternative (2@C rebid) so no reason to rebid 1NT. |
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT||at|
zasanya: In 1D-1S-3@c auction how many HCPs the 3C promises?|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


cp|8|at|

Fred:|CP||AT| Hard to be specific zasanya - 19 HCP is generally enough, but with great distribution you can have less than that. Most important thing to keep in mind is that opener's jump shift rebid is FORCING TO GAME. With, say, AKQxxx of diamonds and AKxxx of clubs you have "only" 16 HCP but reasonable to force to game since you need so little from partner to give 5 of a minor a good play.|

mb|1S|lb|*bPlease choose your bid before Fred does!^^2d|nt||cp|8|at|
Fred->Kibitzers:|CP||AT| Should I bid my diamonds or raise clubs (by cuebidding the opponents' suit)? It is really hard to know, especially since the opponents might be able to bid a lot of spades! And given that partner might have something like 3433 distribution, I don't think I should insist on clubs. I will bid a simple (Forcing) 2D for now, and see where that takes me. Hopefully the opponents bidding (or lack thereof) and partner's action will help me make an intelligent decision.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


mb|2D|mb|4S|mb|p|NT||cp|8|at|
Fred->Kibitzers:|CP||AT| partner should only DBL here if he has a strong spade holding, but that is not exactly a well-known fact among newish players. His Pass therefore denies having a lot of strength in spades and gives me hope that we make 5 (or 6 or 7) of a minor.|sk|S|

mb|p|nt||sk|N|lb|*bPlease choose your bid before Fred does!^^5c|cp|8|at|
Fred->Kibitzers:|CP||AT| There is no space left for me to investigate the proper level, so I am just going to raise clubs now - maybe we will miss a good slam, but there is a good saying that applies here, "You can't be perfect over preempts." Partner should know I have "only" 4 clubs and that I have longer diamonds. Because with 5-clubs I would have insisted on clubs myself on the first round.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt||cp|8|at|
Fred->Kibitzers:|CP||AT| I could gamble on slam here. If partner has as little as the AK of clubs and the Ace of hearts (only 11 HCPs) slam is probably excellent - requiring 1 of 2 finesses at worst.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|at|
Fred->Kibitzers:|CP||AT| I think this is a close call (whether to Pass or bid 6D) and a hard decision with a non-regular partner. No strong feelings, but I think I am going to Pass - one negative factor is that suits may be breaking badly. the opponents did bid to the 4-level vulnerable.|

TwstofLime: Fred, do you ever count your opener for 7 losers, add to yours, and subtract from 24?|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


cp|8|at|

Fred:|CP||AT| Sandy, about "losing trick count." The way I think about it is, it is a similarly useful tool to HCP count, the law of total tricks, etc. All of these methods of hand evaluation work well in some circumstances but all of them tend to be abused by those who believe in them. This hand is a good example. |
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT||cp|8|at|
Fred:|CP||AT|In terms of my decision about whether to bid 6D at the end or to Pass as I actually did by far the best way to make a decision like that is to think about various hands that partner could hold. Everything is a complete guesswork. I am not claiming my decision to Pass was "right" by the way. If I had this problem in a serious tournament I would have spent a lot more time constructing possible hands for partner. Note the nice bid by Firsty raising all the way to 4S with only 2 HCPs.|

zasanya: How strong spades holding for dbl? Is Qxx sufficient?|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


cp|8|at|

Fred:|CP||AT| Not in my view zasanya. For me DBL is a strong opinion that it is right to defend. With Qxx you have no idea. Pass means "I have no idea." So you should have a lot of strength in their trump suit to DBL in front of partner. Typically you need 2 honors and at least 1 sure trump trick. I suspect there would be more questions about this hand. It is a tricky one but let us move to the next board.|

Fred->Kibitzers:|CP||AT| I almost have enough to scrape up a raise to 2H here but I don't like it that most of my strength is in a suit bid by my opponent, especially when I also have length in that suit. There is a good chance my partner doesn't have very many clubs - if so then my @CK may be worthless on offense. And if partner has 2+ clubs, perhaps the opponents will be able to ruff out my King.|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


NT||cp|8|at|
Fred->Kibitzers:|CP||AT| Also note that it is likely that Patty has a good hand. I have only 4 HCPs, East is also a passed hand, and West's 2C overcall puts some kind of a limit on her strength.

Fred->Kibitzers:|CP||AT| I could lead a spade in the hope of maybe getting a ruff eventually. But a forcing defense (i.e. making declarer ruff and eventually run out of trumps) is another possibility. Also, I know the opponents have at least 7 spades between them (since presumably partner doesn't have 5 spades). So declarer will eventually have to play spades for herself. After all said and done, a heart it is.|

Fred:|CP||AT| One thing you can see from this hand is that it would have been very wrong for me to either sit for partner's DBL of 2C or to DBL 3C myself. DBLing 3C is really bad because, if it goes down 1 (not unlikely) I gain only 50 points (getting 100 instead of 50). But if it happens to make I lose 360 points (-470 instead of -110).|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


NT||cp|8|at|
Fred:|CP||AT| You have to be very careful about DBLing partscores, especially at IMPs or total points scoring. Also if you are vulnerable. Because you have more to gain there (200 instead of 100). Also more to lose (670 instead of 470). At Match Points it is different but still be careful please because if you are wrong you will very likely get a bottom board!|

If my 4-card suit was spades it would be different. Then I have an easy 1S rebid after a red suit response. And if you respond spades I can raise.|

Fred:|CP||AT| Yes, I see that. Let me address a couple of minor points.|
PG| ***** 190 ***** |


NT||cp|8|at|
Fred:|CP||AT| Ian, at trick 5, best to return the 7 of clubs (and not the 5) from that holding. I saw something similar on a previous hand. A player lead back the small card from 10x. I think the defense is supposed to come out on top on this deal. But it looks like you already figured that out :).|
PG| ***** 191 ***** |


at|

ian84: True, also I should put up my spade 10 on first lead of spades.|
PG| ***** 192 ***** |


NT||cp|8|at|
Fred:|CP||AT| Now to my partner. There is something to be said for ducking a diamond BEFORE drawing trump. As you saw your Ace of clubs entry to the dummy is vulnerable to attack. So even if the diamonds break you may not be able to get to them. But they can't really do anything about your Queen of trump entry. However the hand is a little more complex than that. As there is something to be said for playing clubs yourself early.|
PG| ***** 193 ***** |


NT||cp|8|at|
Fred:|CP||AT| Maybe you will set up a club trick and, if not, maybe you will be able to ruff a club in the dummy. On the other hand, given Donnas's excellent opening lead I suspect that going after diamonds was your best play. A hard thing to learn is when to draw trumps because there are so many possible considerations. There are really no good rules available. But one time not to draw trump is when you know that you will need trumps for entries. This hand arguably falls into that category.|
PG| ***** 194 ***** |


NT||at| 
eleno59: Could you have made a limit raise instead of the 2D bid?|
PG| ***** 195 ***** |


cp|8|at|

Fred:|CP||AT| My decision to force to game was a bit aggressive but like the concept that "an opening bid opposite an opening bid should force to game." Therefore, if you play super-light opening bids, that concept has less value.|

2 wee ones: What would have you bid had I bid 2NT partner?|
PG| ***** 197 ***** |


cp|8|at|

Fred:|CP||AT| I would make the same 4H bid (at least without prior discussion). Playing 2/1 GF, 2NT is certainly the right rebid with my partner's hand. Playing SAYC I am not so sure. I have to admit that I am not really familiar with all the ins and outs of such things in SAYC but I think 2NT rebid is supposed to show some extra values. I could easily be wrong about that.|

Fred->Kibitzers:|CP||AT| This is pretty hopeless - if I try to draw trump, even if I am lucky about the heart layout, the opponents will almost certainly be able to take a bunch of spade tricks. I am going to lead spades myself. That will either force them to let me ruff a spade in the dummy or force them to play trumps for me (which rates to be better than my playing trumps myself).|

Fred:|CP||AT| Okay, let's talk a bit about the bidding. "Reverses" are a scary topic for newish players and a difficult topic in general. Here the 2D rebid was a "reverse" because diamonds is a higher-ranking suit than clubs. There is a bit more to it than that. 1C-1H-1S is not a reverse even though spades is higher ranking than clubs. The 2D bid is a reverse because it forces partner to go to the 3-level in order to support opener's first suit.|
PG| ***** 218 ***** |


NT||cp|8|at|
Fred:|CP||AT| In "standard bidding" a reverse promises substantial extra values--about 17 HCPs--in high cards (or the equivalent in playing strength). My partner did not have enough to rebid 2D. She would need roughly another King in order to have enough to reverse.  2C is a better rebid with her actual hand.|
PG| ***** 219 ***** |


NT||cp|8|at|
Fred:|CP||AT| Now what to do AFTER a reverse is much more difficult! For example, how does the responder attempt to signoff? With my hand some players would find my 2H rebid to be normal while some would prefer 3C (if that was non-forcing). And some play some kind of convention whereby either 2S or 2NT is an artificial bid to say "I have a bad hand!"|

NT||cp|8|at| 
Fred:|CP||AT| In some parts of the world, the expert community favors opening 1D with minimum hands and 4-5 in the minors so that you have a "prepared rebid." I am not a fan of that style of bidding but that does not mean I am "right." As I keep telling you there is a lot in bridge that is best discussed with partner (as opposed to being matters of right and wrong) even if what you decide is second best.|

zasanya: What are the minus points for opening 1D with 4-5 in minors?|
PG| ***** 222 ***** |


cp|8|at|

Fred:|CP||AT| One is that you sometimes end up in a 4-2 fit :). For example, after 1D-1major-2C, partner would normally bid 2D with a weak hand and 2-2 in the minors. My personal preference (a strong one given how strong the clubs are in the actual hand) is to open 1C. 2C rebid is fine, but I can also live with 1NT rebid (yes I know 2 doubletons). A hand like: void Axxx AKQx Jxxxx is an exception. With such strong diamonds and such weak clubs, I personally think it is the lesser of 2 evils to open 1D.|

Fred:|CP||AT| Be careful when people use words like "wrong" instead of saying "in my opinion" :).|

tu||qx|3,A Note About Maureen and the Beginner Intermediate Lounge - BIL|cs|1|CP|4|AT|^-
{     The Beginner/Intermediate Lounge:  A History in Progress    }
^-|cp||fp|4|cs||at|^B@2^Z@3As a teenager, Maureen Hall thought about learning to play bridge but, as often happens, study/work/marriage/family put that aside for another day.  When that day came, bridge lessons went very well for Maureen.  “Well, relatively so,” she says.  She was soon off to a table at the local Bridge Club.  She only admits that all should feel sorry for the club director.  “The least said the better.” 

Maureen, not one to be defeated by 52 cards, decided she would learn to play “this game.”  She Googled ‘bridge’ and found a reference to Bridge Base with the keyword ‘educational.’  She opened the site, downloaded, and discovered  . . .

Four tables were at play in the Main Bridge Club—“all experts in my eyes.”  Yet, she continued to kib and play on occasion. As BBO continued to grow, Maureen felt the Main Bridge Club was and “continues to be a very scary place for beginners and even for some intermediates to try to play and learn and develop their game.

“I would no sooner find a few fellow beginners and they would be gone,” she recalls.

She posted an article in the Bridge Base Forum, expressing her view the Main Bridge Club be split so Beginner/Intermediate players might have a separate place to play and learn.  Fred’s reply made it clear he would be unable to address that in the near future as he and Uday were focused on development of a tournament facility. When the tournament room came into being, the BBO Forum Moderator for the Beginner/Intermediate section Inquiry (Ben) decided to hold a tournament for Beginners and Intermediates.  Alas, Ben’s tournaments, too, were overtaken by the Advanced players.

So Maureen polished off a proposal outlining her vision for the BIL, took a deep breath and clicked ‘send’. The very next morning, she opened her in box and found Fred’s response.  
^c@2^x@3^*IHi Maureen,  I am about to get on a plane and I may not be able to respond to e-mail until Monday, but what you are planning sounds great (I will respond in detail next week) and I have set up your private club.  Regards, Fred^*N 
|FP|4|at|^B@2^Z@3We will not describe the shock, tremor, and emotional earthquake Maureen experienced but will simply tell you on 3 September 2003, the Beginner Intermediate Lounge (BIL) was born. Maureen’s vision, still a work in progress, has offered beginners and intermediate players a ‘safe haven’ for learning and making friends for many years.

Maureen gives heartfelt thanks to the many volunteers who have “shared and worked shoulder-to-shoulder with me to achieve this dream.”

{     Introduction of the Cast    }
^-|CP||AT|

^*B(Sandy)^*n In 2009 Sandy instigated and taught a series for Starter players which became known as Bridge 101 and gave rise to the program now referred to as the BIL's Beginning Bridge Program - a series of 4 preregistered courses taking the starter player through beginner and improving beginner levels. In addition Sandy has masterminded the Scribblers team (illustrated help for using BBO), the SET ( Special Events Team) can always  be relied on to help out.

^*BNome^*n (Kia) is our prolific Bridge Movie maker, The BIL Library's Nome collection numbers 330 movies. His crowning glory being the re-creation of Watson's famous Play of the Hand book ( Part 1) bringing the book alive and providing BIL members with an exceptional learning tool. He is taking time out now from the weekly grind, however we have reason to believe that work is continuing with Watson's Part 2.

^*BArvina^*n (Arvina) Mentor, TD for 2 weekly Power of One T's, 2 Jackpot T's and the Saturday Convention Tourney and mastermind/creator of the new Bridge Movie Catalogues - a huge task. Thank you Arvina.

^*BMoonjohn^*n (John) has been TDing the BIL jackpot tourney for at least 5 years. ^*BFirsty^*n (Eileen) a former member of the Special Event Team and now BILHost3 for the new weekly Practice Sessions. Thank you John and Eileen.

The Practice Sessions were added to the BIL calendar in March this year. These one to two hour sessions are held in between the Open Teaching Sessions to help newcomers to get to know one another, to learn to use the BBO software and have a face to seek  advice from about the BIL and BBO.  We currently have a team of some 24 BIL Hosts.

^*BWyoming33^*n (Eileen) and ^*BRealrowdy^*n (Linda) both  long serving BIL Assist announcing the weekly teaching sessions and keeping the lessons flowing smoothly assisting the teachers with player changes and looking after the 'housekeeping' issues. ^*BMick357^*n (Patty) aka BILHost5 is one of our new team of Practice Session Host. Thank you Eileen, Linda, and Patty 

^*BDONNAS^*n aka BILHost2, ^*B2 Wee Ones^*n (Leigh) aka BILHost24 and ^*Bian84^*n (Ian) aka BILHost15 are all volunteer BIL Hosts who run several of the daily practice sessions in the BIL. Thank you Donna, Leigh, and Ian.|
