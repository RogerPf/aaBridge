nt||bt||rh||ah|Deal of the|ah|Week #169|nt|
This week's deal was played by Bruce Gowdy, one of Canada's all time great players. The deal was reported to us by John Gowdy. When he gets a little older we will refer to John as an all time great as well. For now John is just "one of Canada's top players" (as well as a great friend). John and Bruce are distant cousins who formed one of Canada's top partnerships of the 1980s. Although the Gowdys do not play as partners these days, both John and Bruce continue to be very active and successful in the Toronto bridge community.

Bruce Gowdy has been winning bridge tournaments since the late 1940s. He has always been known as more of a card player than a bidder. In this week's deal Bruce was faced with finesses in every suit. He carefully and correctly selected which finesses to take and thereby made his contract. There is nothing particularly fancy about this deal - just the good solid technique that has helped make Bruce Gowdy such a winner over the years.

There is something new in this week's deal - interactive quizzes. Hopefully you won't need any further instructions on how to answer these quizzes. However, there is a link to an instruction page below.

Bruce, South, was the dealer and nobody was vulnerable.|

lb|*BWhat call did Bruce make?^^1S|

mb|1s|nt|OK, that wasn't a very difficult quiz, but we wanted to show you how the new quiz facility worked. Once upon a time there were players that would open Bruce's hand with a weak 2@S, but nowadays 1@S would be a near universal choice.|

West's opening lead was the @S9. Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on.|

ls|ns|pc|SJ|pc|S3|pc|S4|nt|
Bruce carefully called for the @SJ from dummy. You will see in a moment why this was a smart move. East followed with a small trump as dummy's @SJ won the first trick. |

His next move was to surrender a diamond trick to the defense. West won the @D9 as East discarded a club.|

Bruce made the winning decision of ruffing West's diamond return high with dummy's @SK.|

nt|Bruce made another winning decision on the next trick, finessing against East's @SQ. You can now see why it was crucial to play the @SJ at trick 1. If Bruce had played the @S8 to the first trick the lead would now be in the dummy. Bruce's plan (which you are about to see) required him to be in his hand at this point in the play.|

hs|nc|hs|sc|at|Bruce was faced with the problem of avoiding 3 club losers. The club suit contained 2 finesses, one against the @CA with West and one against the @CQ with East.

ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|nh|hs|sh|nt|
Bruce managed to get home without taking any club finesses. He wisely chose to finesse in hearts instead.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|pc|H5|pc|H4|pc|HJ|pc|HQ|nt|Bruce led a heart from his hand and, when West followed small, he finessed the @HJ, losing to East's @HQ. If West had played a heart honor to this trick, Bruce would have won the @HA and exited with the @HJ, discarding a losing club from his hand. |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


sk||hs|ec|hs|eh|nt|Bruce had lost a trick in hearts (a suit in which he had no losers), but that trick came back with interest. East, with only hearts and clubs remaining, was endplayed. Not only was East forced to give Bruce access to the stranded @HA, he was forced to give up another trick in the process.|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


ls|ec|ls|eh|mc|10|nt|Bruce claimed his contract, conceding one club trick to the defense. This was a very well played hand by just about anyone's standards, but it was just another day at the office for Bruce Gowdy.

Thanks to John Gowdy for sharing this deal with us.|
