This week's deal is a declarer play problem.

If you like declarer play problems you should think about purchasing Bridge Master 2000. Bridge Master 2000 is an educational program that is designed to improve your declarer play.  All bridge players, ranging from novices to Deal of the Week regulars, will find their card play has improved after using this program.

The first version of Bridge Master was released in 1992 and is still widely considered the best medium ever devised for improving declarer play. The user interface has been completely rewritten for the 2000 edition of Bridge Master. Several new features and special effects have been added. The bottom line remains the same: Bridge Master is both good for your bridge and fun to use.

Bridge Master 2000 comes on a CD-ROM and is intended to be run under Windows 95, 98, or NT. Bridge Master 2000 will also run on a MacIntosh equipped with Windows 95 emulation software. A copy of the ACBL's free Learn to Play Bridge program (also written by Bridge Base Inc.) is included on the Bridge Master 2000 CD-ROM.

Additional information about Bridge Master 2000 (as well as other educational software products developed by Bridge Base Inc.) is available through this web site. If you have previously purchased an older version of Bridge Master you are entitled to a substantial discount on Bridge Master 2000.

You choose to overcall 3NT as South (we prefer double), which becomes the final contract.|

hs|ncsc|nt|You already know how the East-West spades and hearts are divided. By playing on clubs it will be possible to get a complete count on the hand. This should help you to know how to play diamonds to best advantage.|

sk||hs|wded|nt|
Given that West has 2 diamonds and East has 4, your best chance for an extra diamond trick is to hope that West as dealt a doubleton @D9 (leaving East with 4 diamonds to the @DQJ).|

Let's return to the first round of diamonds and give West a chance to make a clever falsecard. Suppose West plays the @d9(!) on your diamond lead towards dummy. |

You win the @DK as before and lead the @D10 from dummy, but once again East follows small. Any second thoughts about passing the @D10 now?|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


md|0,dq,,d2|hs|wd|nt|West's falsecard should give you second thoughts. Perhaps he was dealt @DQ9 |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


md|0,dj,,dQ|at|or @DJ9 doubleton. |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


ls|wd|hs|sd|at|In this case it would be a big mistake to pass the @D10. Going up with the @DA instead would land the contract if West was dealt honor-nine doubleton in diamonds.|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|
The answer depends on West's level of ability. Against most Wests you should take the play of the @D9 at face value and go up with the @DA on the second round.|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


md|0,d2,,dj|nt|If, however, you suspect West is a strong enough player to routinely find the play of the @D9 from @D9 doubleton, then you should pass the @D10 on the second round. There are 3 @D9 doubletons that West could hold and only 2 holdings of @DQ9 and @DJ9 doubleton.|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |

up|10|hs|ncsc|nt|On the given lie of the cards you also could have succeeded by winning the third round of clubs with dummy's @CJ.

pg| ***** 31 ***** |


hs|nd|at|The @D10 could then be led, pinning West's @D9 doubleton as before.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


ls|nd|

nt|There are 2 problems to this approach. First, by playing diamonds from dummy on the first round, you lack the entries to win a 3rd trick in diamonds when West began with honor-nine doubleton. This factor is especially important against a West player who is not strong enough to falsecard from @D9 doubleton.|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


up|4|md|0,c9dj,,d92|hs|ecwc|nt|The other problem with winning the 3rd round of clubs in dummy is that it might be West, not East, who was dealt 3 cards in clubs. |
