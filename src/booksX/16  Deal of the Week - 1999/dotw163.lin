nt||rh||ah|Deal of the|ah|Week #163|bt||nt|
This week's deal was played by Hong Kong's Sam Wan. Sam has been one of Hong Kong's strongest players for many years and he has represented Hong Kong in 2 World Team Olympiads. Sam is a very creative bidder and a highly skilled card player. There is nothing spectacular about the way Sam played this week's deal, but his technique and table feel were both impressive.

We have tried to improve the loading time of the Deal of the Week. If you have a fast internet connection you will not notice any difference. If you are using a standard modem, however, the software will load more quickly. The downside is that you will not be able to watch the deal using pictures of playing cards immediately. The deal will come up in hand diagram notation. Shortly thereafer the Display button will become enabled. At that point you can switch to pictures of playing cards if you prefer that display mode.

Several users (particularly those with MacIntosh computers) have reported problems with the new Deal of the Week software. We are working hard to try to find solutions to these problems. If you have any trouble using the new Deal of the Week software, please report the problem to:

West dealt and opened 1@S, Sam's partner doubled as North, and East raised to 4@S.|

This was passed around to Sam's partner who doubled again. According to their partnership agreements, the second double asks partner to bid if he has a distributional hand, but to pass with a balanced hand.|

Sam therefore bid 5@C which was doubled by West.|

5@C doubled was the final contract.|

West led the @SA (Ace from Ace-King) and North put down a reasonable dummy. At first glance it looked like 5@C should have good chances as there were only 2 obvious losers (one spade loser and the @CA).|

at|Think about how you would play before reading on.|

nt|Sam realized that he was in considerable danger. West was marked with 5 spades (from the bidding) and 4 clubs (from the previous trick). If West's remaining cards consisted of 1 heart and 3 diamonds the contract had no chance, unless West's singleton heart was the @HK.|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|Sam could succeed if West was dealt 4 diamonds and a heart void. In this case Sam would have to cash dummy's remaining diamonds, discarding hearts, before overtaking the @CJ. West would eventually win the @CA and be forced to give Sam access to the South hand to draw the remaining trump.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |

Sam's table presence told him that diamonds were 6-2 leaving West with 5224 distribution. Can you see what heart holding Sam needed West to have in order to make his contract?|

Sam needed West to have been dealt a doubleton @HKJ and that is exactly what he was dealt when this deal was played!|

Sam left the diamonds alone and continued with the @CJ, overtaking with the @CQ in his hand. |

hs|wh|nt|Superficially it looked like Sam now had to guess whether West's remaining heart was the @HJ or the @H9. You have probably seen by now that Sam is not a superficial player. He realized that if West had been dealt a doubleton @HK9 he had no chance - East would duck Sam's lead of the @H10 from dummy and West would later win a second trump trick.|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


ls|Wh|hs|nhsh|nt|
Sam therefore played a low heart from dummy to his @HQ and was quite satified to see West follow with the @HJ. |

Sam claimed the rest of the tricks and his contract. Nicely played Sam and thanks for showing us the sights and sounds of Hong Kong - one of the most remarkable places we have ever visited!|
