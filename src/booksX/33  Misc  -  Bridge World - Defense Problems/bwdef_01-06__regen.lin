cp||at|: KEEP IN TOUCH. East, reading the four-of-spades lead as a singleton or a doubleton, should realize that the contract cannot be set unless West started with a doubleton spade and a quick entry, such as the queen of diamonds. If East withholds the king and jack of spades from the first trick, West will have a spade left to lead when in with his entry card (the second spade lead clears the suit, so East can run the suit when in with the ace of diamonds). If East releases the king or jack of spades on the first trick, declarer should make the contract bid by ducking the first spade lead and winning the second.|

at|^b@2|at|^^|cp||at|^bGUARD THE QUEEN. The declarer cannot make the contract if West leads the jack of clubs when on lead with the queen of diamonds. This play is clearly indicated after analyzing declarer's possible club holdings. The concealed club holding must be something like Q-x, Q-x-x, K-x-x, or K-8-x; otherwise, declarer would have the rest of the tricks. Any club lead beats the slam if South has one of the first three holdings. The critical case is K-8-x, against which the jack of clubs is the only lead that will surely succeed. |

at|^b@2|at|^^|cp||at|^bUSELESS RUFF-SLUFF. East is faced with the crucial defensive play after winning the third lead of hearts and cashing his spade trick. The lead of a spade or a club, even though it gives declarer a sluff and a ruff, will surely defeat the contract. In contrast, if East leads any diamond, declarer can make the game. The key to determining the correct play is for East to count the suit distribution and calculate that South started with a four-card diamond suit; in that case, a sluff and a ruff cannot possibly hurt the defense. |

And East should overtake the second club to give the ruff. To make it easier for partner to do the right thing, with the cards as shown in the diagram West should win the first club with the king, then return the jack. Similarly, from king-queen doubleton West should play king-then-queen, to alert East to the need to do something unusual.|

cp||at|: FIRST THINGS FIRST. East should win the diamond lead and lead a heart at trick two. (It is essential to establish a heart trick for the defense before giving partner a diamond ruff. If East instead gives West a ruff at trick two, declarer can avoid the loss of a heart trick.) This line of defense will net four tricks--ace of spades, ace of diamonds, king of hearts and a diamond ruff.|
