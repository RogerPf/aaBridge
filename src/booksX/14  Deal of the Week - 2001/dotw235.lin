|cs|4|at|^-{ ^*BSPECIAL!!! There are 2 Deals of the Week this week!!!^*N }
^-
Both deals took place last Thursday night at ^*BDoubles Duplicate Bridge Club^*N in Toronto. The Thursday night game at Doubles offers significant cash prizes to the winners and many of the top players in the Toronto area are regulars in this game. ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N was playing with his friend, ^*BJohn Gowdy^*N, when these deals were played. The Thursday night games at Doubles are scored using matchpoints so overtricks are very important.

We have added a search function on the web page that lists the past ^*BDeals of the Week^*N:

nt|This week's first deal is a defensive problem that Fred faced. Remember that the scoring was matchpoints so overtricks are critical. This week's second deal will be presented at the end of the first deal. In the present deal John and Fred defended 3NT after South had opened 1@D and rebid 2NT to show a balanced hand with 18 or 19 HCP.|

nt||lb|*CWhich card would you play?^^ck^ckcj|ls|ec|pc|CK|
nt|Play the @CK. It is a near certainty that declarer has the @CAQ. If you play the @CJ then declarer will finesse the @CQ and, when that wins, he will suspect that you were dealt the @CKJ doubleton. If you play the @CK, however, declarer might think that you were dealt a singleton @CK and subsequently misjudge the play. |

pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||lb|*MWhat suit would you discard from?^Spades~Hearts~Diamonds^1|ls|es|ls|eh|ls|ed|pc|s2|
nt|Discard a small spade. You definitely want to keep all of your hearts, the suit that partner led. Furthermore, your small diamonds could well have some value (if you don't see why your small diamonds could be important you will understand soon). |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


hs|es|hs|ns|nt|The bidding, partner's opening lead, and the early play strongly suggest that declarer is 2344. Don't worry about keeping fewer spades than dummy. By discarding a discouraging spade you are suggesting that you can stand a heart continuation from partner.  You should expect your partner to continue hearts, leaving declarer without enough time to set up an extra spade trick.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|es|pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|ht|pc|h6|nt|John got the message (no surprise as he is an excellent defender). He continued with a small heart and declarer allowed Fred's @H10 to hold the trick. |

pc|C7|pc|S7|pc|C9|
at|Declarer continued with a club to the dummy as John discarded a spade. What do you think Fred discarded as East?|hs|es|hs|ed|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt||lb|*CWhat card did Fred play?^^dk^sq65dk65|ls|es|sk||nt|Fred chose to jettison the @DK and this proved to be a good thing as you can now see. Fred was certain by this point that declarer began with 2344 distribution. South was known to have been dealt the @HAQ, the @CAQ, and needed to have the @SA in order to have the 18 HCP that his 2NT rebid promised. |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


hs|wd|hs|sd|nt|The fact that declarer played a diamond to dummy's @DA at trick 2 suggested that he was dealt a fairly strong diamond holding. It was a near certainty that South was dealt the @DQ, but Fred suspected that John had been dealt the @DJ. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|There were 2 good reasons why Fred thought that John held the @DJ. First, if declarer had been dealt that card, he might have taken an early diamond finesse instead of leading to dummy's @DA. Second, John played his lowest heart on the third round of the suit - a suit preference signal that suggested a high card in diamonds.|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


ls|sd|ls|wd|nt|Fred obviously could not afford to discard a spade at this point, but he could not afford to discard a small diamond either. |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


ls|ed|pc|d5|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|at|Had he done so then the declarer could continue with a diamond to his @DQ (this declarer was not only a good player and a good guesser, but very aggressive in trying for overtricks as well). |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|dq|pc|d8|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


hs|sd|hs|ed|nt|He could then set up a further diamond trick while keeping John (who had a heart winner to cash) off lead. |

pg| ***** 32 ***** |


at|Fred gave up any chance there might be to defeat the contract, but this play ensured that the declarer would not make any overtricks (on the assumption that Fred was right about the position of the @DJ). It is not clear that Fred made the right play here, but discarding the @DK was certainly a fun play to make!|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|nt|The declarer actually continued by finessing Fred for the @DJ anyways! He could not come to 10 tricks regardless of how he played from this point and he thought that Fred might have discarded the @DK from @DKJxx in a desperate attempt to try to get declarer to cash out for +600. |

nt|Here is this week's bonus second deal. Fred was the declarer in 3NT after a 4th suit forcing auction. The East-West cards have been changed slightly so that the unusual squeeze that Fred was playing for would be legitimate.|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


hs|wh|nt|West's opening lead was a 4th best @H7. |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |

pg| ***** 41 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|at|The contract was secure, but there were 2 basic approaches to trying to win as many overtricks as possible. Both of these approaches revolved around the spade suit. Fred first considered playing on the side suits in order to try to get a count on the hand in case it was necessary to guess spades.|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


hs|es|nt|He abandoned this plan when he decided to play on spades immediately in the hope that he could cash 4 spade tricks and that the East hand might come under pressure in the process. This approach seemed like the right idea when East followed with the @SJ on the first round of the suit. |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |

hs|eh|hs|ed|hs|ec|at|but East seemed to be in serious pain when the fourth round of spades was cashed. This was appropriate as East was squeezed in 3 suits on this trick. |
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


ls|ed|ls|ec|nt|A discard from either minor would allow Fred to win all 13 tricks so East wisely chose to discard his remaining heart. |
