This week's deal is a nice defense by ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N and his partner, ^*BBrad Moss^*N, from the second final session of the ^*BNABC Open Pairs II^*N in Kansas City. Fred and Brad were in 4th place going into this session, but they subsequently scored poorly and finished in 18th place. 

The biggest ^*BBridge Base^*N success in Kansas City came when Fred and ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N Vice President ^*BSheri Winestock^*N finished in 5th place in the ^*BNABC Mixed Pairs^*N. That was fun!

At the end of this week's deal a declarer play quiz is presented. The answer to that quiz will be given in next week's ^*BDeal of the Week^*N.

nt|Brad, West, was the dealer and only East-West were vulnerable (the vulnerability is indicated in the top left of the diagram above - red is vulnerable and white is not vulnerable). What call do you think Brad made? Remember that the form of scoring was matchpoints.|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


nt||lb|*BWhat call did Brad make?^^3c|
hs|wc|nt|Brad chose to open 3@C, a call that is far from perfect, but the kind of call you sometimes have to make when a matchpoint event is coming to an end and when you need some big results in order to win. It is hard to know whether opening 3@C rates to be a winning or losing action, but we definitely like Brad's choice given the cicumstances.|mb|3C|

Over to Fred (pretend you don't remember what Brad's hand is). North Passed and Fred had to decide whether or not to bid 3NT. What call do you think Fred made? |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||lb|*MWhat call did Fred make?^3 Notrump~Pass^2|
mb|P|
nt|Fred thought that this was a close decision, but he chose to Pass. Fred reasoned that a plus score seemed likely in 3@C, but that 3NT could be down several tricks if Brad's club suit was not headed by the @CA. Meanwhile Fred had good defense if the opponents chose to enter the auction. On the actual deal 3NT would have been a big success.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|Fred did consider bidding 3NT for the same reasons that Brad used to justify his 3@C opening (that the partnership needed a good result), but he realized that Brad might have already taken an unusual position by opening 3@C. When both partners operate on the same deal, the patient usually dies so Fred thought that he should play the straight man on this one.|

South's balance of 3@S was passed around to Fred. What call do you think that Fred made now?

|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^p|mb|P|
nt|Fred chose to Pass and 3@S was the final contract. Fred liked his chances of beating 3@S, but he did not like them nearly enough to double (given that the opponents could make 5@S on some layouts). Meanwhile Fred thought that 4@C was unlikely to make (even with a likely spade lead) and not unlikely to get doubled (putting the disastrous -200 into play).|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


sk||nt|You can now see that Fred's judgment was not very good on this deal. 4@C might well have resulted in an overtrick (after a spade lead) and 3NT and 4@H were both likely makes as well (not that 4@H was ever in the picture once Brad chose to open 3@C). Meanwhile 3@S should also have succeeded, but Fred and Brad found a way to lead declarer astray...|
