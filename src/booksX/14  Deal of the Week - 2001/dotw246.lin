^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 246 - May 28, 2001 ^*N }
^-
|cs|4|at|^-{ ^*BSPECIAL!!! There are 3 Deals of the Week this week!^*N }
^-
The deals presented were played last Friday night at ^*BJohn Rayner's^*N bridge club just outside of Toronto. ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N had the pleasure of playing with ^*BLarry Cohen^*N, one of the great bridge players and writers in the world today. John Rayner and ^*BBarbara Seagram^*N (of ^*BKate Buckman's Bridge Club^*N) had brought Larry to Toronto for a series of lectures and special events. Fred and Larry had a very enjoyable game, despite getting bottom scores on 2 of the 3 deals reported here.

Fred and Larry have worked together to create 3 educational software products:

|cs|2|at|^-{  ^*BPlay Bridge with Larry Cohen
The 1999 Life Masters Pairs
Day 1, Day 2, and Day 3^*N }
^-
In each of these products Larry guides the user through all of the deals from a day of one of the toughest matchpoints events of them all. In each deal the user takes the seat of the player with the most interesting problems. Larry offers a detailed analysis of the bidding, play, and defensive problems that the user faces and presents hundreds of interactive quizzes to test the user's skills.

hs|wd|hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|In this week's first deal, Larry opened 1@D as West in third position, North made a very aggressive takeout double, Fred bid 1NT as East, and South's 2@S bid ended the auction.  Despite the fact that Larry found a very nice defensive play to hold 2@S to 8 tricks, -110 was a bottom board as every other East-West pair played in 1NT and went down 1 for -100.|

hs|eh|at|Fred thought it would be a clever idea to return a deceptive @H10 (instead of the normal @HJ). Fred wanted to make it look like he had @HQ109 in the hope that declarer might decide to play Larry for the @SQ.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ls|eh|pc|HT|nt|There are 2 things you should think about before making a falsecard. First, make sure you know why you are falsecarding - random falsecards sometimes help the opponents. Second, make sure that there is no danger of partner misdefending as a result of your falsecard. On this deal Fred could not think of a layout in which leading the @H10 would cause a player of Larry's calibre to go wrong.|

nt|On this week's second deal, Fred opened 1NT as South (the directions have been changed to make South the declarer). West overcalled 2@D to show diamonds and either major. Larry's 2NT was the Lebensohl covention, forcing Fred to bid 3@C. When Larry followed up with 3NT he promised a stopper in diamonds. 3NT was the final contract. |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


pc|S6|
nt|West's opening lead was the @S6 (fourth best). Before we get into discussing the play, notice Larry's decision to not look for a penalty at the 2-level despite his excellent defensive prospects. Larry knew he had a chance for a big number, but he expected the field to be in game and did not want to risk a bottom if only +500 was available. |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|Furthermore, Larry liked his equity with Fred on play in 3NT, especially given that West's 2@D bid would often make it easier for Fred to play the hand. Note also Larry's decision to not look for a 4-4 heart fit. Larry's anemic hearts, his extra high card strength, and the bad breaks suggested by West's 2@D all contributed to this decision.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


hs|ns|nt|OK - enough about the bidding. Your partner thinks that you rate to score a lot of matchpoints with you on play in 3NT. Try not to disappoint him. Think about how you would play as declarer. Your big decision comes at trick 1 with your play from dummy. |

hs|wd|Hs|nd|hs|sd|nt|Fred's contract would now be safe with 1 spade trick, 2 heart tricks, 3 diamond tricks (via the marked finesse against West's @D10 if necessary), and 3 club tricks. |

hs|es|hs|ns|nt|Note that on this layout it would be fatal to make the normal looking play of the @S10 from dummy at trick 1. East would cover with the @SJ |

ls|es|ls|ns|pc|st|pc|sj|hs|ss|hs|ws|hs|wd|at|and Fred would be left with no way of preventing West from winning 4 spades tricks and the @DA. |

ls|ws|ls|wd|ls|ss|up|2|hs|ns|hs|ws|hs|wd|hs|es|nt|Fred thought that the @SQ was the correct play on this deal because he thought that West was a favorite to hold both the @SA and the @DA given the bidding, but that East could easily hold the @SJ. |

up|15|ls|ws|hs|nh|hs|sh|nt|This was another bottom board since every other North-South pair bid and made either 4@H or 3NT. Larry's decision in the bidding and Fred's decision as declarer did not work out very well on this deal, but we certainly don't think they deserved to get a bottom!  Larry and Fred finally got a good result in this week's third deal which is presented on the next page.|

hs|ss|mb|1h|nt|East dealt and opened 1@H. Once again Fred and Larry were vulnerable against not. How many spades do you think Larry bid as South? |
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


lb|*MHow many spades did Larry bid?^One~Two~Three~Four^1|mb|1s|nt|Larry bid a simple 1@S and we agree with his decision 100%. Larry's hand is too good for either a weak jump overcall of 2@S or a preemptive 3@S and his hand lacks the playing strength for 4@S at this vulnerability. Larry thought it would be best to take things slow and hope to be able to judge well later in the auction. As you will see, this approach worked very well on the actual deal. |
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


ls|ss|mb|p|sk|n|hs|nc|nt|After West passed, Fred had to decide how many clubs to bid as North. Fred and Larry had agreed that 2@C would be forcing and that 3@C would be weak. They had not discussed what 4@C would mean. Think about what you would bid as North and try to forget that you already know what Larry was dealt. |
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


lb|*MHow many clubs did Fred bid?^Two~Three~Four~Five^1|mb|2c|nt|Fred chose to bid 2@C, following similar reasoning to what Larry used to select his 1@S overcall. Fred's hand was too good for 3@C, he did not even consider bidding an undiscussed 4@C, and 5@C was too big a position. He also thought it best to go slow and to hope to judge well later in the auction...|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


hs|sc|hs|ss|mb|2d|sk|s|nt|East bid 2@D and we are back over to Larry. Larry's hand had been greatly improved by Fred's 2@C bid. What call do you think that Larry made now? |
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Larry make?^^2h|mb|2h|nt|Larry chose to cuebid 2@H. He certainly could have bid 4@S at this point with reasonable expectation of success, but Larry thought that there was a good chance that there would be more bidding. He judged that it would be a good idea to let Fred know that he thought the hand belonged to North-South.|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


ls|ss|ls|sc|sk|n|mb|d|hs|nc|
nt|West doubled Larry's 2@H cuebid, making it Fred's turn to bid again. What call do you think that Fred made as North?|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Fred make^^4c|mb|4c|nt|Fred choose to bid 4@C. Usually when your partner makes a strength-showing cuebid that is ambigiuous as to distribution it is a good idea to give him as much room as possible to describe his hand. Fred thought that this hand was an exception to the rule and that it was time for him to make a statement about the playing strength and orientation of his hand. |
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


ls|nc|mb|4d|mb|4s|sk|s|hs|ss|nt|East was not through yet. He competed with 4@D and Larry bid 4@S. |
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


ls|ss|mb|5h|sk|n|at|West finally came out of the woodwork and bid 5@H. What call do you think Fred made as North?|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^p|mb|p|nt|Fred chose to pass. He didn't really care if Larry interpreted his pass as forcing or not - he figured that he had described his hand already and that Larry would be in a good position to know what to do. |
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


mb|p|mb|5s|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|sk|s|hs|ss|at|Larry did in fact know what to do! He went on to 5@S, passed around to East who doubled. 5@S doubled was the final contract. |
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


sk||nt|As you can see 5@S doubled made easily as only 1 heart trick and 1 diamond trick had to be lost. We do not think much of some of the East-West bids on this deal (we think West should have bid a preemptive 3@H on the first round and that East should have bid 3@D instead of 2@D), but we still think Fred and Larry deserve the good result that they had on this deal.|
