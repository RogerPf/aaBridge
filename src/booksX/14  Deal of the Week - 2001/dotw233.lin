^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 233 - February 26, 2001 ^*N }

The 9th ^*BForbo-Krommenie^*N took place last weekend in Scheveningen, The Netherlands. Complete coverage of this tournament, including ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N, is available through:

^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N was a member of the North American Team that won the ^*BNations Cup^*N event at the 2001 Forbo. Fred's teammates included his regular partner, ^*BBrad Moss^*N, and ^*BHoward Weinstein-John Carruthers^*N. Fred was not exactly expecting to do so well in this event as the other 3 teams represented 3 of the strongest bridge nations in the world, Italy, Poland, and The Netherlands.

This week's deal took place during the other event at the Forbo, the ^*BInternational Teams^*N (in which Fred's team did not score nearly as well). The Forbo International Teams is arguably the strongest Swiss Teams event in the bridge calender. Many of the best players from all over the world play in this event each year and the field is filled out by dozens of strong Dutch teams.

nt|The Netherlands is a very special place for bridge players for several reasons. First, Holland has the largest per capita bridge population in the world. Second, major Dutch corporations (like ^*BForbo-Krommenie^*N) have taken an interest in our game and the sponsorship of such companies has made it possible for the hard-working local organizers to run some spectacular bridge tournaments each year.

Something strange happened to Fred when he arrived in The Netherlands last Tuesday. Fred was planning on spending a couple of days staying with his friend ^*BKoen Gijsman^*N (the webmaster of BridgePlaza) in Amsterdam before the Forbo tournament began. Koen lives very close to Amsterdam's Central Train Station and Fred decided that he would not have any trouble walking to Koen's house from there (Fred had been to Koen's house several times in the past).

Well Fred, being a foolish Canadian, got lost among the canals of Amsterdam. Even more foolishly, Fred had not written down Koen's phone number or address. Fortunately a stranger approached Fred and said, "Are you that bridge player from Canada? You look tired and lost." He was right on all accounts. He then called Koen on his cell phone, received directions, and escorted Fred to Koen's house! We are quite certain that this true story could happen only in The Netherlands, which is truly a paradise for bridge players.

This week's deal was played by ^*BFemke Hoogweg^*N, one of Holland's rising stars of Women's bridge. Femke was playing with World Champion ^*BWietske van Zwol^*N against Fred and Brad when this week's deal was played.  This week's deal is not as difficult as most of our ^*BDeals of the Week^*N, but it does contain a theme we have never seen before. Others deals from the 2001 Forbo will be presented in upcoming ^*BDeals of the Week^*N.

Think about whether you would play the @HK or the @HJ from your hand. This is not a guess - there is definitely a correct answer to this problem. Would you play the right card for the right reason?|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt||lb|*CWhat card would you play?^^HJ^HKHJ|ls|sh|pc|HJ|hs|eh|hs|wh|sk||nt|Femke correctly played the @HJ from her hand. This proved to be a smart move as you can see by looking at the rest of the cards in this deal. With the @HQ on her right and the @HA on her left, Femke claimed her contract. Her aggressive bidding and strong play had earned a vulnerable game swing for the Dutch Ladies Team.|

nt|So do you understand why it was correct for Femke to play the @HJ at the critical point of this deal? Fred's vulnerable overcall and the theory of split Aces would seem to suggest that, once Brad leads the @SA, the @HA is more likely to be on her right (making the @HK the winning play).|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


ls|wh|ls|eh|ls|sh|hs|es|nt|The key inference that allowed Femke to come up with the correct solution to this problem had absolutely nothing to do with the bidding - it had to do with Fred's encouraging signal to the first trick. |

nt|On the above layout a heart switch would not help matters, |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


hs|sc|md|0cthq,c9hk|at|but, if Brad was dealt the @HK and Femke's clubs were stronger, a heart shift at trick 2 would be necessary to defeat the contract (otherwise 3 of dummy's hearts would eventually be discarded on declarer's clubs). |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


md|0hkc9,hact,,hq|ls|wh|ls|eh|ls|Sc|hs|es|up|3|nt|The bottom line is that this is a deal in which the defenders are in a terrible position. They are forced to either tell declarer how to make the contract on some layouts (such as the actual layout) or give up on defeating the contract on other layouts. Congratulations to Femke for figuring all of this out and for playing the right card for the right reason!|
