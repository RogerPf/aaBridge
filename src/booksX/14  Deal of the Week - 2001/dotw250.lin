sk|s|nt|East dealt and opened with a strong 1@C, showing 16+ HCP with any distribution, and Dalthor noticed that he was dealt a pretty strong hand himself. An experienced partnership might have a way to show various 2-suited hands over a strong 1@C, but Dalthor was playing online bridge with a pickup partner. Both sides are vulnerable. What would you do as South?|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


nt||lb|*bWhat call did Dalthor make?^^1h|mb|1H|
hs|sh|nt|Dalthor bid a simple 1@H as South. That may seem obvious, but consider the merits of passing (not that we suggest this without prior discussion with partner). 1@C is forcing so you will you get another chance to bid (at which time you will know more about what everyone was dealt). |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|We think it makes a great deal of sense to play that direct actions over a strong 1@C are used for the purpose of disrupting the opponents' auction. Hands with genuine game interest should pass over 1@C and then act on the next round of bidding (if it still seems like a good idea). Pass certainly has theoretic merit, but Dalthor's 1@H was a very practical choice given the circumstances.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


hs|sd|ls|sh|mb|p|an|0-5 HCP|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2D|
nt|West passed to show 0-5 HCP and, after Dalthor's partner passed, East balanced with 1@S and Dalthor took advantage of this convenient opportunity to show his second suit. |

ls|sd|hs|Sh|mb|2S|mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|
at|Everyone had something to say on the next round of bidding - West raised to 2@S, Dalthor's partner bid 3@H, East competed to 3@S, and Dalthor took a very reasonable shot at 4@H which became the final contract. |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||ls|sh|pc|S3|
nt|West's opening lead was the @S3. Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on. |

sk||hs|eh|hs|sd|hs|sc|nt|The actual layout of the remaining cards is shown above. East could have defeated the contract by returning his remaining trump as Dalthor would have no way of avoiding a loser in each minor. |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|sd|ls|sc|hs|es|hs|sh|at|East thought that it was safe to return a high spade however, and after ruffing this trick, Dalthor proceeded to show East why this was not a safe choice. |

pg| ***** 20 ***** |


hs|sd|hs|eh|nt|Dalthor made the necessary play of leading a high diamond from his hand while leaving East's last trump outstanding. East ruffed (it would not have helped him to discard instead), |

pg| ***** 27 ***** |


hs|sd|hs|nh|nt|Dalthor claimed the rest of the tricks to make his contract, stating that he would establish the diamonds with a ruff in the dummy. |mc|10|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


ls|sd|ls|nh|up|20|at|That was a very nicely played hand, but as we saw, East did have a chance to defeat the contract. Here is the position after Dalthor won the @DA. Can you see how he could have denied East the opportunity to defeat 4@H?|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


hs|sd|nt|In order to make his contract legitimately from this point, Dalthor had to make the unusual play of continuing diamonds from the top! |

hs|sd|hs|eh|nt|Dalthor could now get home by either leading his remaining high diamond at once (East can ruff and get out with the @HK, but Dalthor would later be able to establish and cash a spade winner for a club discard) |

hs|eh|hs|wh|nt|Those of you who want an additional challenge should verify that there is no legitimate way to make the contract against best defense if East was dealt the @HK73 or @HK72 (instead of his actual @HK32). |

At|Here is another interesting possible layout of the East-West cards. Now declarer can succeed by leading any of 5 different cards to the next trick. Can you see which cards they are?|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


hc|hth9h8cac6|nt|On this layout of the trump suit, declarer can succeed against any defense by leading either the @H10, @H9, @H8, @CA or @C6 from his hand at this point. In most continuations declarer will end up establishing the diamonds with a ruff in dummy before drawing trump to enjoy the 13th diamond.|
