In Toronto the ^*BGIB Team^*N will face the winners of the ^*BFlight B Grand National Teams^*N and in subsequent matches they will face stronger and stronger teams. We are hopeful that these matches will help generate some positive media attention for bridge.

sk|s|nt|Thanks for your patience! Here is this week's first deal. 

When this deal was played Fred was playing with ^*BZia Mahmood^*N in the team event at the International Festival of Bridge in Biarritz, France. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


hs|sd|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1d|nt|After 3 passes, Fred opened the South hand with 1@D (he and Zia had agreed to always open 1@D with 4-4 in the minors). |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


ls|sd|hs|ss|mb|p|mb|1h|mb|p|mb|1s|at|Zia responded 1@H and Fred rebid 1@S. Fred and Zia had agreed that, if a minor suit opener was dealt a balanced hand, he would always either raise responder or rebid in notrump (for example, Fred would rebid 1NT with 12-14 HCP and 4243 distribution). |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt|According to this style, Fred's 1@S suggested an unbalanced hand in his partnership with Zia (this would not be true in any "standard" bidding systems). |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


ls|ss|mb|p|mb|2c|mb|p|mb|?|at|Zia's rebid was 2@C. Fred and Zia had agreed to play that the bid of the 4th suit by an unpassed hand would be forcing to game, but they had not had any discussion about when a passed hand bids the 4th suit.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


hs|sc|mb|3c|nt|As such, Fred was not sure what Zia was up to with his 2@C call, but Fred's 3@C bid seemed like a good idea regardless of how Zia had intended 2@C. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


ls|sc|mb|p|mb|3d|mb|p|mb|?|at|Zia's next bid was 3@D. Fred presumed that Zia's hand was too good to bid a non-forcing 3@D on the round before. Fred, with a very solid opening bid, wanted to drive to game, but he was not sure if 3NT or 5@D would be better. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt|One thing was sure - if 3NT was the right contract then it would be best for Zia to declare (to protect his possibly positional holdings in spades, hearts, and clubs). |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


ls|sc|hs|ss|mb|3s|at|Fred chose to improvise with 3@S. He knew that Zia would expect a good hand for this call (otherwise Fred would have passed 3@D), and he was hoping that Zia would bid 3NT if that was right. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


ls|ss|hs|sd|mb|p|mb|4h|mb|p|mb|5d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|
Zia actually cuebid 4@H to suggest the @HA in a great hand that was unsuitable for notrump. Fred thought he had done enough bidding and signed off in 5@D which was the final contract.|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


ls|sd|pc|ct|
nt|West led the @C10. Although Zia's dummy contained some nice cards for Fred, his hand was not as strong as Fred had been expecting (Fred expected a similar hand with the @DQ and/or a 5th diamond). It turns out the 5@D was not a very good contract, but all this proves is that it is almost impossible for a new partnership (even 2 experts) to always be perfectly in tune in the bidding.
|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||pc|cj|pc|cq|pc|ca|at|
Dummy's @CJ was covered by East with the @CQ (rats!) and Fred won his @CA. Think about how you would play this hand as declarer. |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|This is an extremely complicated hand. We would need a computer and quite a bit of time to determine the best percentage play on this deal! Trust us on this: there is not a single bridge player in the world who is good enough to solve problems like these at the table. We cannot tell you what the best line of play is, but Fred's line was interesting (and successful).
|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


hs|scnd|nt|Fred started by ruffing a club in dummy |

hs|ndsd|at|in order to lead a diamond toward his hand. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


ls|ndsd|pc|d7|pc|dt|hs|sd|at|When East produced the @D10, Fred covered with the @DJ |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


ls|sd|pc|dj|pc|dq|at|and West won the @DQ (more rats!). |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|da|pc|d4|at|West returned a diamond to East's @DA |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


pc|hk|pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|ha|at|and Fred won East's @HK return with dummy's @HA. |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


hs|nsss|nt|Things were looking grim. Fred knew that he would need to finesse West for the @SQ in order to have a chance, |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


ls|ns|hs|sc|at|but he still had to worry about the 4th rounds of both the spade and club suits. At first glance it looked like Fred would have to find a way to ruff the 4th round of clubs in the dummy and then rely on a 3-3 spade break. Can you see how he made his contract from here?|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


sk||ls|sssc|hs|es|nt|Fred actually found a neat play that involved neither ruffing his last club in the dummy nor depending on a 3-3 spade break (which is just as well since East was dealt 4 spades). You can now see all 4 hands. Can you see how Fred was able to come to 11 tricks? There is only 1 solution on the actual lie of the cards.|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


ls|es|hs|nh|hs|sd|nt|Fred continued by ruffing a heart in his hand |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


ls|nhsd|pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|d6|pc|h6|

pg| ***** 32 ***** |

ls|ssnsws|pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sj|pc|s3|

hs|ndwd|nt|When Fred drew West's last trump with dummy's @D9, |

ls|ndwd|pc|d9|
hs|ehes|at|East was ^*Bsqueezed^*N in the majors. |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


ls|es|hs|nh|at|If East had discarded the @HQ then dummy's @H10 would win a trick. |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


ls|ehnh|hs|essc|at|East actually discarded a spade and Fred threw his @C8 |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


ls|essc|pc|s8|pc|c8|pc|d5|

nt|In this week's second deal, ^*BGeoff Hampson^*N opened  the powerful South hand with a strong, artificial, and forcing 2@C bid. Geoff was playing with ^*BReese Milner^*N in the pairs event in Biarritz. The fact that this event was scored using matchpoints certainly influenced Geoff's choices in the bidding of this deal. |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|There are plenty of experts in North America who would prefer to open 1@H (rather than 2@C) on Geoff's hand. This hand has the necessary offensive strength for a 2@C opening, but its defensive strength is questionable for 2@C. This makes some sense to us, in theory, but Geoff is what we would call a practical player and opening 2@C on these kinds of hands has worked well for him in practice.|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


mb|P|mb|2D|an|Waiting bid|mb|P|mb|3H|an|Sets hearts as trump|

hs|sh|nt|Reese responded with an artificial waiting 2@D bid and Geoff jumped to 3@H to set that suit as trump and to ask Reese to cuebid. |
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


mb|P|mb|4C|an|Cuebid|mb|P|mb|4N|an|Roman Keycard Blackwood|

ls|sh|at|When Reese cuebid 4@C to show the @CA, Geoff chose to make the unusual call of 4NT (Roman Keycard Blackwood) despite the fact that he held a void. |
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|Beginners are taught to ^*Inever^*N bid Blackwood with a void (because the response usually won't help you decide which Ace(s) are missing). Geoff correctly judged that 4NT would be safe on his particular hand with a void because he already knew his partner held the @CA. As such, Geoff would know which Ace(s) Reese had been dealt regardless of his response to 4NT.|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


mb|P|mb|5H|an|2 Keycards|mb|P|mb|7N|an|Optimistic!|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|
nt|When Reese showed 2 keycards with his 5@H, Geoff knew that Reese had to have the @DA as well as the @CA. Geoff could now count 12 top tricks (the @SA, 8 hearts, the @DA, and 2 clubs). As little as the @CJ in addition would give Geoff a reasonable play for 13 tricks. He therefore chose to take the (characteristically) aggressive path by bidding 7NT!

|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt||pc|DK|hc|da|hc|ca|at|West's opening lead was the @DK and Geoff was unlucky in that Reese's hand did not have much in the way of value beyond the 2 Aces that he had already shown. Still, with an expert declarer at the helm, it is often the case that 12 tricks can become 13. Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 53 ***** |

up|47|ls|ss|hc|sk|nt|Not surprisingly, Geoff and Reese had earned a top board for bidding and making 7NT on these cards. Also not surprisingly, East-West were not very happy with this result and blamed each other for discarding badly. In fact, the only "mistake" the defenders made on this deal came with the opening lead. The @SK is the only card that West can lead which would result in the defeat of 7NT!|
