 Some of the features of ^*BBridge Base Online^*N include:
@0

@0
   - @2Special ^*Bteaching tables^*N where bridge teachers can set up tables where they can do things like see all 4 hands, sit in more than 1 seat, and have their students play prepared lesson deals.
@0
   - @2The ability to create either ^*Bpublic or private bridge clubs^*N within BBO. "Real" bridge clubs, National Bridge Federations, and groups of individuals can use this facility to set up their own online bridge communities within BBO.
@0
   - @2A ^*BPartnership Bidding Room^*N. Partnerships can use this facility to practice bidding randomly dealt hands (with or without constraints) while online.
@0
   - @2A ^*BDouble Dummy Room^*N where visitors can experiment with the play of various double dummy problems. Deep Finesse, the highly acclaimed software that solves double dummy problems, has been integrated into various areas of BBO.

hs|es|hs|wh|nt|When this week's deal was played Americans ^*BRalph Katz^*N and ^*BSteve Garner^*N faced ^*BKrzysztof Jassem^*N and ^*BPiotr Tuszynski^*N of Poland. Katz, South, played in 3NT after Tuszynski, East, had opened 1@S in third position and Katz had made a semi-psychic 1NT overcall (over which Jassem, who had passed originally, competed to 2@H).

Even though Katz was -50 in his 3NT, USA won 3 IMPs on this board. They would have won 11 IMPs if 3NT had succeeded.|
