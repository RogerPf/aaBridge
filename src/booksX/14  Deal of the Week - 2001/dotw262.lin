^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 262 - September 17, 2001^*N }
^-
Our thoughts are with our many American friends and their families as a result of the horribly insane and tragic events that took place in the United States last week.  ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N was obviously not intended as a forum for discussing world events, but we have been deeply moved by what has happened. We hope we can speak for all of the world's bridge players in extending our most sincere sympathies and best wishes to all Americans in these difficult times. 

This week's deal was played by ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N on ^*BBridge Base Online^*N, the new online bridge game that was developed by ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N You can do a lot more than just play online bridge using this software. This program is ^*Bfree^*N and it is ^*Bmuch^*N better than any of the other online bridge games out there. Furthermore, the people who play on ^*BBridge Base Online^*N are actually nice to each other! Please give this program a try!

Fred and/or ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N Vice President ^*BSheri Winestock^*N are usually connected to ^*BBridge Base Online^*N and they will be happy to help anyone who has any questions or problems.

sk|s|nt|East opened the bidding with 1@C, but that was the only bid made by either East or West. Fred ended up as declarer in 4@S. |
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


pc|C7|at|West's opening lead was the @C7. Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|Oh, by the way, if you are wondering about the opponents carding agreements you will have to keep wondering for about 10 more tricks! Fred played this hand in a friendly online bridge game against 2 strangers in a pickup partnership. He knew they had not discussed their lead conventions and did not think it was fair to ask West about this.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|nt|As there are only 15 outstanding high cards points, East is almost certain to have the @DA for his opening bid. As such, there are 2 top diamond losers and the third round of that suit could be a problem as well. |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|nh|hs|sh|at|At first glance it appears that the contract will depend on playing hearts for 1 loser. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|hs|ns|hs|ss|at|If there is a trump loser the contract will have no chance. |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sh|ls|ns|ls|ss|nt|We are sorry, but we cannot state with any confidence what the "correct" line of play is on this deal. Fred's basic plan was to find out as much information as he could about the other 3 suits before deciding how he would tackle the hearts. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|hs|nd|hs|sd|nt|His first move was to try to deal with the diamond suit. |

pg| ***** 10 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|at|Fred thought it would be smart to lead a low diamond toward his @DJ at once. Yes, this is a strange way to play this card combination, but Fred knew that he would want to lead a diamond down eventually and that he might need dummy's few remaining entries for other purposes. |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|pc|d2|pc|DQ|
nt|East went up with the @DQ (so far so good) |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |

hs|nc|at|and returned the @CJ, won by Fred in the dummy. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


ls|nc|pc|cT|pc|C4|pc|ck|at|West followed with the @C4 and Fred still had no idea what was going on in clubs. As far as Fred was concerned, West might have been dealt  @C74, @C874 (playing "MUD" leads"), @CQ874 (with the lead being 3rd/5th best). In theory East's @CJ denied the @CQ, but Fred was unwilling to bet on that. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|hs|nc|hs|ss|nt|There is some case to be made for ruffing a club now (you will see why in a moment) |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|ss|hs|nd|hs|sd|hs|ed|at|and perhaps some case for playing a diamond to East now as well. |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|ls|ed|hs|ns|hs|ss|at|Fred was concerned that clubs might be 5-2, however, and he was unwilling to go down on an overuff in that suit. He therefore crossed to his @SA |

ls|ns|ls|ss|ls|ns|ls|ss|pc|s4|pc|S3|pc|sA|pc|S5|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


hs|ss|at|and continued with the @SQ from his hand. |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


ls|ss|pc|sQ|pc|SJ|
hs|ns|nt|When West followed with the @SJ Fred paused for thought. He had planned to win the third round of spades in the dummy, but if the @SJ was a true card (it would have been an nice falsecard if West still had the @S9 left), Fred thought that he could safely get some more information by overtaking his @SQ with dummy's @SK. |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


ls|ns|pc|sK|pc|S6|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|ss|nt|Fred then ruffed a club in his hand (the play that perhaps he should have made earlier - as it turns out he was somewhat lucky that the @SJ had appeared). |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|ss|ls|ss|pc|c5|pc|C3|pc|s2|pc|CQ|at|West followed with the @CQ. If West had discarded on this trick, Fred would have played East for a doubleton honor in hearts, leading the @HJ or @H10 from dummy after drawing the last trump. |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|At last, Fred thought he had figured out the club position. West had started with the @CQ74 and had decided to lead the @C7 for some reason (you see all sorts of things playing online bridge and there are some parts of the world where it is considered normal to lead the @C7 from that holding). Meanwhile, East's trick 3 @CJ return from @CJ832 was kind of strange...|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sh|nt|At least it was now 100% clear that East had been dealt both the @HK and @HQ in order to give him enough points for an opening bid. Fred realized that he was going to have to endplay East in hearts in order to make his contract.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|hs|nd|hs|sd|nt|Fred now chose to exit in diamonds (in retrospect playing a trump at this point is at least as good a play), |

pg| ***** 28 ***** |


pc|D5|
hs|sd|hs|nh|at|East played back another diamond and Fred carefully discarded a heart from the dummy as he won his @DJ. He thought he would need dummy's last club so that he could later ruff it, thereby eliminating East's safe exit card in that suit.|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


ls|sd|ls|nh|pc|dJ|pc|D9|pc|h3|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|Fred continued with a spade to dummy's @S10, drawing East's last trump |

ls|ns|ls|ss|pc|s7|pc|D7|pc|sT|pc|S9|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|ss|at|and ruffed dummy's last club in his hand. |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|ss|pc|c6|pc|h6|pc|s8|pc|c8|at|He was surpised to see East discard a heart on this trick as West followed with the 13th club, the @C8. Now Fred ^*Ireally^*N knew what had happened in clubs. West had led a 3rd/5th best @C7 from @CQ874 and then falsecarded with the @CQ on the third round of that suit.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


sk||hs|nh|hs|sh|hs|eh|nt|Well, West's falsecard in clubs was not a success as revealing the @CQ made it relatively easy for Fred to reach the above position. Fred exited with a low heart to dummy's @HJ and East's @HK. |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|ls|eh|pc|h2|pc|H7|pc|hJ|pc|HK|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


hs|eh|hs|nh|at|East was indeed endplayed as Fred had hoped. He actually got out with a low heart and Fred rode this around to dummy's @H10 |
