^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 255 - July 30, 2001^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played yesterday during the ^*BDeep Green Challenge Match^*N at the ^*BACBL Summer NABC^*N in Toronto, Canada (the home of ^*BBridge Base Inc.'s World Headquarters^*N).

The ^*BDeep Green Team^*N consists of  ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N, ^*BBrad Moss^*N (Fred's regular partner), and 2 ^*BGIB^*N computer programs playing as partners.  ^*BGIB^*N, developed by ^*BMatthew Ginsberg^*N, is currently the strongest bridge playing program in the world. ^*BGIB^*N can be purchased through this web site (and we think that you will find that the price that we offer is lower than in most places). For more information about ^*BGIB^*N click on the yellow rectangle below (a new browser window will appear).

The California-based team of ^*BKevin Bathurst^*N, ^*BAri Greenberg^*N, ^*BChris Lubesnik^*N, ^*BLisa Liberati^*N, ^*BRandolph Hammock^*N, and ^*BGary Moore^*N qualified to play in this challenge match by winning the ^*BFlight B Grand National Teams^*N the previous week in Toronto. Unfortunately, only Kevin, Ari, and Chris were still in Toronto at the time the challenge match was scheduled. More unfortunate news (for the ^*BDeep Green Team^*N at least) is that these 3 are among the strongest junior players in North America. It was agreed that they would add another strong young player, ^*BDavid Grainger^*N of Toronto, to fill out their team for the ^*BDeep Green Challenge Match^*N.

nt||va|5|at|The juniors played great bridge throughout this 64-board match. They led by 36 IMPs at halftime and, despite a late rally by the ^*BDeep Green Team^*N, held on to win by 13 IMPs. We are very glad that the $10,000 prize awarded to the winners of this match will go to such fine young men (and such fine bridge players)!

This match was broadcast live (and for free) through ^*BBridge Base Online^*N, the new online bridge software that was developed by ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N This was our first live broadcast and, although there were some glitches, we are happy to report that the basic technology seems to work! We will certainly try to arrange to have additional tournaments broadcast in this manner in the future.

If you have not tried ^*BBridge Base Online^*N yet, please check it out! You can play free online bridge using this software, but it has many other interesting features as well. You can download the software for free by clicking on the blue rectangle below (you will be taken to the download page in a new browser window).

This week's deal was the first deal played in the fourth quarter of the ^*BDeep Green Challenge Match^*N. It was one of the most exciting deals in the match and, if the swing had gone the other way, then ^*BDeep Green Team^*N would have prevailed. The deal has been rotated to make South the declarer.

Ari Greenberg dealt and opened 4@H with the strange West hand. |

ls|wh|hs|nc|at|^*BGIB2^*N was now faced with an interesting problem as North. Do you think that ^*BGIB2^*N passed or bid 5@C? |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


lb|*MWhat call did GIB2 make?^Pass~5 Clubs^1|

mb|p|
nt|GIB2 chose to pass. Is this a reasonable decision? That is a hard question to answer. When GIB has a bidding decision to make it generates a series of possible deals based on the bidding that has taken place. It then does a double dummy analysis on these deals in order to see how various actions would fare. GIB2 obviously decided that 5@C rated to be a long run loser versus pass. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|Given the way that GIB makes its bidding decisions, in some sense it is not fair to be critical of its decision to pass over 4@H. Still, we think that 5@C has a lot going for it in a world filled with less than double dummy people. Some of the time when 5@C is the wrong double dummy action it will still be the winning action (as the opponents may subsequently misjudge, misplay, or misdefend). |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


mb|p|ls|nc|hs|ss|
nt|
In any case, we do not think that GIB2's pass was horrible, but we generally like to bid if we think it is close in these situations. Kevin Bathurst passed as East and ^*BGIB1^*N now faced a bid or pass decision as South. Do you think GIB1 passed or bid 4@S?


|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


lb|*MWhat call did GIB1 make?^Pass~4 Spades^2|mb|4S|
nt|GIB1 chose to bid 4@S. We really like this decision. The South hand has a very high offense to defense ratio. The North hand has more high cards and fewer losers than the South hand, but it also contains considerably more in the way of defensive values.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt|The relative offense to defense ratios of the North and South hands is one of the main reasons why it is more clear for South to bid than it is for North. The other main reason why bidding is more attractive with the South hand is that South can bid spades at the 4-level, North must go to the 5-level in order to bid clubs.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |

Ari made a disciplined pass as West, leaving GIB2 with another difficult bidding problem. Do you think that GIB2 rescued his partner with 5@C or did he leave GIB1 to rot in 4@S?|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


lb|*MWhat did GIB2 do?^Rescued GIB1~Let GIB1 Rot^2|
mb|p|

nt|GIB2 chose to let GIB1 rot in 4@S. In our view this is another very close decision. We have no strong feelings either way and sincerley hope we never have to face the bidding problems that GIB2 had to face on this deal!|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


hs|es|ls|nc|mb|d|
nt|Kevin chose to double 4@S, but we think that we would have bid 5@H is his position. For one thing, Kevin had no idea if he could beat 4@S or not. Also, it was entirely possible that 5@H could be making. When both sides could be making and a big set is out of the question, the IMP odds favor bidding in these situations.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


mb|p|mb|p|ls|es|hs|nc|nt|
Poor GIB2 had yet another impossible bidding problem to solve! Did GIB2 choose to go quiety again or did he try to rescue his poor doubled brother?|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


lb|*MWhat did GIB2 do?^Go Quietly~Rescue Brother^1|mb|p|
nt|GIB2 chose to pass once again. Once again we have no idea if this is the "right" bridge decision (if GIB2 thought it was then GIB2 is probably correct). In these situations we generally choose to trust the opponents. If they think that 4@S is a bad contract then they are probably right!|
