^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 261 - September 10, 2001^*N }
^-
This week's deal is a declarer play problem. For those of you that are familiar with ^*BBridge Master 2000^*N, an educational software product that was developed by ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N, this deal will look like the sort of deal that you might see in that program. In fact, this is almost a "real" deal - we have only changed a few spot cards to make it slightly more challenging.

For those of you who are not familiar with ^*BBridge Master 2000^*N, this program is an excellent way to improve your declarer play skills regardless of your current level of play (yes, even if you consider yourself a great declarer this program will really make you better).

In ^*BBridge Master 2000^*N you are always the declarer. The deals that  you play are not randomly dealt. Each deal is constructed to illustrate a particular point of card play technique. The instructional deals in ^*BBridge Master 2000^*N range in difficultly level from elementary to almost impossible. When you are finished with the lessons that come with this product it is possible to purchase hundreds of supplementary deals at whatever level of difficulty you wish.

What makes ^*BBridge Master 2000^*N such a great learning medium is that this program will only allow you to make your contract if you take the correct line of play. If you make any mistake as the declarer your contract will be defeated. As such, you are forced to learn from your mistakes (unlike "real" bridge where poor defense or a lucky lie of the cards will often let a declarer get away with his mistakes).

Each deal that you play in ^*BBridge Master 2000^*N contains an animated ^*BBridge Movie^*N that explains the correct line of play as well as the reasoning that you can use to figure out the correct line. The presentation of these ^*BBridge Movies^*N is very similiar in nature to those that appear in our ^*BDeals of the Week^*N.

hs|sc|sk|s|nt|OK, end of commercial. Here is this week's deal. You are sitting South and you have a very nice hand! Only your side is vulnerable. West deals and opens 1@D, your partner passes, and East responds 1@H. Suppose you bid 2@C (yes, there are other reasonable calls, but this is a play problem, not a bidding problem). |
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


mb|D|an|3-card heart support|mb|3C|mb|3H|
ls|sc|nt|West doubles to show 3-card heart support (the ^*Bsupport double^*N is one of the few conventions we really like, by the way, as long as you are playing a strong notrump system). Your partner raises to 3@C and East competes with 3@H. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


mb|5C|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|
hs|sc|at|Again, there are other reasonable calls, but suppose you jump to 5@C which ends the auction. |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


ls|sc|
pc|HA|
nt|
West's opening lead is the @HA. Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|
nt|There is a good chance that West was dealt the @SK to help make up his opening bid. As such, there is a strong danger that you will have to lose 2 spade tricks as well as a trick to the @DA. |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|hs|nd|hs|sd|at|If you can guess who has the @DJ, however, the contract will be safe as you will be able to discard one of dummy's spade losers on the third round of diamonds and later ruff a spade in the dummy. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|sc|nt|You should clearly start by ruffing West's heart opening lead with a trump other than the @C2. You have far more high trumps than you need and only one low one, the @C2. Best to save that @C2 in case you need it to get to the dummy at a later point in the play (guess what - you will!).|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


ls|sc|pc|H5|pc|H7|pc|C8|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


sk||hs|ed|hs|wd|hs|nd|hs|sd|nt|Now, if you had to guess who had the @DJ you would play West for that card, not so much because of the fact that he opened the bidding, but because his opening bid was 1@D. West is very likely to have at least 5 diamonds, making the @DJ a favorite to be on your left. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


md|0,d7sj,,djs7|nt|It would be wrong, however, to pass the @D10 or @D9 on the first round of the suit. It is by no means unlikely that East was dealt the @DJ and if he was allowed to win a trick with that card the contract would have no hope. In fact, this is not a hand for guessing at all. There is a line of play that is certain to work in the likely event that the @DA is with West. Do you see it?|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|ls|ed|ls|wd|md|0,djs7,,sjd7|hs|nc|hs|sc|nt|Play a club other than the @C2 to dummy's @CK (the @C2 to dummy's @C7 is just as good) |

hs|nd|hs|wd|hs|sd|at|Now lead the @D10 (you never know - West might cover with the @DJ) to dummy's @DQ. West cannot afford to take his @DA |

hs|wd|hs|ws|nt|West is now endplayed and must give you your contract regardless of what he returns. |

hs|ss|ls|wd|at|A spade return into your @SAQ will solve your problem in that suit |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


ls|ss|ls|ws|hs|wd|hs|sc|hs|ns|at|while a diamond return will allow you to discard dummy's last spade loser as you ruff in your hand. |
