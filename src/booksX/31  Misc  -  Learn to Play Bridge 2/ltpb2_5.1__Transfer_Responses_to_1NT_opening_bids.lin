^-{ Introduction to Chapter 5 }
^-|fp||cp||at|
Partnerships in bridge make agreements as to the meaning of various bids. The collection of agreements that a partnership uses is known as their bidding system. In the original Learn to Play Bridge program, a bidding system that was referred to as Modern Standard American with 5-card majors was presented. This bidding system was designed to be suitable for new bridge players.

While the bidding system presented in Learn to Play Bridge was sufficient to teach the reader the basics of the theory of bidding, Modern Standard American with 5-card majors was flawed in some ways. First of all, for the sake of simplicity, this bidding system was not meant to be comprehensive or complete - some important bidding sequences were not discussed. In addition, the bidding system in Learn to Play Bridge was not designed to be maximally effective - more advanced bidding systems allow a partnership to bid to the optimum contract with greater frequency.

During the past 5 years or so, a new bidding system named Standard American Yellow Card (or SAYC) has become increasingly popular. SAYC is used by both casual and serious partnerships who play social bridge, competitive bridge in clubs and tournaments, and bridge over the Internet.

ht|b|va|8|at|^o    @2A picture is worth a thousand words and what you see here is a picture of an actual Standard American Yellow Card. As you can see, it is yellow. Less obviously, it is also a card - something called a convention card to be more specific.

at|In bridge clubs and tournaments, each partnership fills out a convention card like the one you see here by filling in various blank spaces and checking various boxes. The purpose of this exercise is to inform the opponents of the bidding conventions and signaling agreements that each partnership has. Remember that partnerships cannot have secret agreements. The convention card is used to disclose a partnership's agreements to the opponents.

ht|v|va|8|at|This particular convention card was designed by the American Contract Bridge League  (or ACBL) specifically for partnerships that are using the SAYC bidding system. The ACBL prints another type of convention card that is used by their members who play other bidding systems. Look closely at this picture. Some areas will make sense to you and when you finish reading this chapter, you will understand much more about the SAYC convention card!

All of the agreements that a partnership makes when deciding on a bidding system describe 2 possible types of bids, natural bids and artificial bids.

|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ A natural bid has something to say about the strain of the bid that was made. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|For example, if a partnership is using weak 2-bids, then their 2@D, 2@H, and 2@S openings are all considered natural bids. These bids are said to be natural because they all have something to say about the suit that was named. For example, when a player opens the bidding with a weak 2@H, he describes a hand with a strong 6-card heart suit.

|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ An artificial bid says nothing about the strain of the bid that was made. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|Partnerships that use weak 2-bids generally use the 2@C opening bid as an artificial bid that is used to announce the possession of a very strong hand. Since a player who opens the bidding with 2@C does not promise any particular length or strength in the club suit, the 2@C opening is said to be an artificial bid.

|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


at|In the earliest days of bridge (the late 1920s), the bidding systems used by most players contained virtually no artificial bids. During the next 30 years or so, some artificial bids (or conventions) were shown to be so effective that they were eagerly embraced by the masses. Many conventions were developed during this time period, but only Blackwood, Stayman, and Gerber (which were all introduced in the Learn to Play Bridge program) became so popular as to be considered part of ^*Istandard bidding^*N.

|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
The trend toward average bridge players using more and more conventions really started to accelerate in the 1960s and it has continued to this day. Nowadays, most bridge partnerships employ several conventions and many bridge players take great pleasure in adding new conventions to their arsenal of bidding weapons.

Bridge has become a more complicated game as a result of the widespread use of many conventions. Whether or not it has become a better game is a subject of intense debate, but one thing is certain: the average modern bridge partnership bids much more effectively than the average partnership from the early days of the game.

|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{ Learning the SAYC bidding system will involve learning several new conventions, 
 but most bids in this system mean exactly what you would expect them to mean. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|In other words, you don't have to worry about unlearning everything that you have already learned about bidding. In SAYC, a 1NT opening bid still promises a balanced hand with 15 to 17 high card points. If your partner opens the bidding with 1@S, you can still bid 3@S if you were dealt a limit raise. Some bids in SAYC will have unexpected meanings for you, but by and large this bidding system should be seen as an ^*Iextension^*N (rather than a ^*Ireplacement^*N) of the bidding system that you currently use.

One area in which SAYC is quite different from the bidding system taught in Learn to Play Bridge (as well as the system taught by the great masters Culbertson and Goren) is in responding to your partner's 1NT or 2NT opening bid. The way in which SAYC handles these important bidding sequences will be the main focus of this chapter.

^-{ Jacoby transfer bids }
^-
|cp||at|Other than Blackwood, Stayman, and Gerber, arguably the most commonly used convention in bridge is known as Jacoby transfer bids (or Jacoby transfers or simply Jacoby). While Jacoby transfer bids are used in response to 1NT, 2NT, and 3NT opening bids in the SAYC bidding system, for now we will concentrate on their use after a 1NT opening bid.

|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


at|If you are not currently using Jacoby transfer bids and your partner opens the bidding with 1NT, here is a summary of what it would mean if you responded by bidding 2 of a suit:

^-{|cs|1|ia|o1n?|at|}
^-
|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


cs|2|at|^C@2{ 2@C - ^EThe Stayman convention
 2@D - ^EA signoff bid suggesting a weak hand with at least 5 cards in diamonds 
 2@H - ^EA signoff bid suggesting a weak hand with at least 5 cards in hearts 
 2@S - ^EA signoff bid suggesting a weak hand with at least 5 cards in spades }
@0
|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


at|Here, 2@C (Stayman) is an artificial bid that is used to ask the opening bidding if he was dealt a 4-card major. 2@D, 2@H, and 2@S are all natural bids that the responder can use when he has a weak hand with a long suit. The 1NT opener is expected to pass when his partner responds 2@D, 2@H, or 2@S - he has already told his partner that he has a strong balanced hand so he should respect his partner's signoff bid.

|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


tb||

nt|^b@2^z@3|va|5|At|In the SAYC bidding system, most of the responses to a 1NT opening bid of 2 of a suit have different meanings than those that were taught in the original Learn to Play Bridge program:

^-{|cs|1|ia|o1n?|at|}
^-
|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{ The 2@C response to 1NT is still the Stayman convention. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


at|Stayman is one of the most useful conventions ever devised and it is an integral part of the SAYC bidding system. The basic mechanics of Stayman are exactly the same in SAYC as they are in the version of Stayman that was presented in Learn to Play Bridge. As you will see later in the chapter, the use of Jacoby transfer bids has some impact on the type of hands with which the responder should invoke Stayman.

|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ The 2@D and 2@H responses to 1NT are Jacoby transfer bids. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


at|In the bidding system that was presented in Learn to Play Bridge, the 2@D and 2@H responses to 1NT were signoffs in diamonds and hearts respectively. You will soon be learning when Jacoby transfer bids should be used and what can happen after a Jacoby transfer.

|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ The 2@S response to 1NT is used by responder to sign off in a minor suit at the 3-level. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


at|The 2@S response to 1NT is not a signoff in spades anymore. The use of the 2@S response to 1NT in SAYC will be discussed in detail later in this chapter. |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
The 2@D and 2@H responses to a 1NT opening bid are examples of Jacoby transfers:

^D{|cs|1|ia|o1n!2d|at|} ^O{|cs|1|ia|o1n!2h|at|}

|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


at|The next question is: what are Jacoby transfer bids used for? 

|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{ A Jacoby transfer bid promises at least 5 cards in the next higher-ranking (major) suit. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


at|So a Jacoby transfer bid of 2@D promises at least 5 cards in hearts and a Jacoby transfer bid of 2@H promises at least 5 cards in spades. With a few exceptions (that will be discussed later in the chapter) the high card strength of the responder's hand and the number of cards that he was dealt in the other 3 suits are not relevant in his decision as to whether or not he should use a Jacoby transfer bid.

|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ Jacoby transfer bids can be used with signoff hands, invitational hands, hands that are 
 strong enough to force to game, and hands that are strong enough to explore for slam. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ Jacoby transfer bids can be used with balanced hands, unbalanced 
 hands, hands with only 1 long suit, or hands with 2 or 3 long suits. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


at|Yes, Jacoby transfers are very versatile bids! All you need to use this convention is a hand with a 5-card (or longer) major suit. |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|va|5|at|The next issue to explore is what happens ^*Iafter^*N the responder to a 1NT opening bid uses a Jacoby transfer bid of 2@D (showing 5 or more hearts) or 2@H (showing 5 or more spades):

|ht|d|va|3|at|^D{|cs|1|ia|o1n!2d?|at|} ^O{|cs|1|ia|o1n!2h?|at|}

|cs|4|at|^-{ After a Jacoby transfer bid, the opening bidder almost always completes the transfer
 by bidding 2 of the major suit that the responder promised by using a Jacoby transfer. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


at|After the responder uses a Jacoby transfer bid of 2@D, the opener will almost always rebid 2@H. Similarly, after the responder uses a Jacoby transfer bid of 2@H, the opener will almost always rebid 2@S. There are some circumstances in which the opener should do something besides completing the transfer. We will explore these possibilities later in this chapter.

One of the most obvious consequences of using Jacoby transfer bids is also one of the main reasons why these bids are so effective (and also why they are called transfers):

|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ After a Jacoby transfer bid is used, the 1NT opener will become the
 declarer if the responder's long major suit becomes the trump suit. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


at|If Jacoby transfer bids are not being used and the responder is dealt a long major suit, he will usually end up being the first member of the partnership to bid that suit. He would thus become declarer if that suit ends up being the trump suit.
|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
|cs|2|at|^-{ If a partnership has a choice as to which player will be the declarer, on most deals 
 it will be to their advantage to try to arrange for the stronger hand to be declarer. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


at|That is not to say that the stronger (that is, better) ^*Iplayer^*N should be the declarer! The above statement means that it will often be possible to win more tricks if the player who has the stronger ^*Ihand^*N ends up being the declarer.

There is a good reason for this. The opening lead give the defense the first chance to attack a suit of their choice. A player with a 1NT opening bid will invariably have a lot of high cards and, if it can be arranged that this player is the declarer, some of those high cards will be protected from immediate attack.

|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


cs|3|at|For example, suppose that hearts are trump and that the 1NT opener has the following hand:

^-{|ih|psaqt4hqj7dk654ckj|at|}
^-
|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


hs|ssscsd|at|Each of the 3 side suits contain high cards that are vulnerable to attack, especially if the partner of the player with this hand has no high cards in these suits. It will be more difficult for the defenders to effectively attack these suits if this hand is the declarer than it would be if this hand is the dummy.|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


ls|sssdsc|

nt|^b@2^z@3
|cs|4|At|^-{ One of the main advantages of using Jacoby transfer bids is that these bids allow the 
 partnership to protect the 1NT opener's high cards by making him the declarer more often. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ The word transfer is part of the name of Jacoby transfer bids because these bids 
 effectively transfer the declaration from the (weak) responder to the (strong) opener. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


at|Even when a partnership is using Jacoby transfer bids as outlined in the SAYC bidding system, they will not always be able to arrange for the 1NT opener to be the declarer. It is the case, however, that the 1NT opener will end up as the declarer on a much larger percentage of deals when Jacoby transfers are being used. This is one of the two primary reasons why the Jacoby convention is so effective in practice. Here is the other reason:

|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ After the 1NT opener completes the transfer, the responder 
 is well-placed to continue describing his hand with his next bid. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


at|^D{|cs|1|ia|o1n2d2h?|at|} ^O{|cs|1|ia|o1n2h2s?|at|}

When the responder invokes a Jacoby transfer bid, he knows what is going to happen next - the opener will complete the transfer, leaving the bidding at a low level for the responder's next bid. The responder can take advantage of this opportunity to give his partner some more information about the strength and/or distribution of his hand.

|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
Here are some example hands that contain 5-card (or longer) major suits. In each case, the partner of the player holding these hands opens the bidding with 1NT. The player with each hand uses a Jacoby transfer bid and the opener completes the transfer. Let's see what happens next.

|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


ht|g|cs|3|at|^D{ |ih|psat942h4d52c97532|at|} {|va|8|cs|1|at|^O|ia|o1n2h2s?|at| }

|va|5|hc|sa|at|This hand has only 6 total points - 4 HCP (the @SA) |
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


lc|sa|hs|sssc|at|and 2 long suit points (1 for each 5-card suit). That is not enough to explore for a possible game contract opposite a 15-17 HCP 1NT opening bid. |
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


ls|sc|hs|ss|at|At the same time, the responder has good reason to believe that 2@S will be a more comfortable contract than 1NT. If Jacoby transfers were not being used, it would be correct to sign off by responding 2@S to the 1NT opening.  

When Jacoby transfer bids are being used, the responder should start by bidding 2@H in order to tell his partner that he was dealt at least 5 cards in spades. After the opener completes the transfer, the responder is able to use his next turn to further describe his hand. |
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


at|In this particular case, the responder has no more describing to do. |ht|g|va|8|cs|1|at|^O|ia|o1n2h2s!p|at| }

|va|5|at|









|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


cs|2|at|
^-{ To sign off in 2 of a major after a 1NT opening bid, transfer to your 5-card

nt|^b@2^z@3|ht|b|cs|3|at|^D{ |ih|psk74hkqt65d932ct4|at|} {|va|8|cs|1|at|^O|ia|o1n2d2h?|at| }

|ls|ss|va|5|hc|skhqk|at|This hand has 8 HCP |
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


lc|skhkq|hs|sh|at|and 1 long suit point for the 5-card heart suit. 9 total points is enough to invite a game contract opposite a 15-17 HCP 1NT opening bid. 

If the opener has a maximum hand with at least 3-card heart support then 4@H rates to be the best final contract. If the opener has a maximum hand with only 2 hearts, then 3NT is probably the place to be. If the opener has a minimum hand, then the partnership will belong in a partial (in either hearts or notrump, depending upon the number of hearts in the opener's hand).

|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


ht|b|va|8|cs|1|at|^O|ia|o1n2d2h!2n|at| }

|va|5|at|







After the responder transfers to hearts and the opener completes the transfer, the correct rebid for the responder is 2NT. This sequence describes an invitational hand with exactly 5 hearts. The opener will be in a good position to place the contract. The number of hearts in his hand will determine whether the partnership will play in hearts or in notrump. The strength of his hand will determine whether to play in a game contract or in a partial.

|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ A Jacoby transfer followed by a 2NT rebid describes an 
 invitational hand with exactly 5 cards in responder's major. }

|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
Now you now know how to invite game opposite a 1NT opening bid when you have exactly 5 cards in one of the major suits. What if you have 6 (or more) cards in a major and a hand with invitational strength?

|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


ls|sh|ht|f|cs|3|at|^D{ |ih|psaqj943h652d9ct73|at|} {|va|8|cs|1|at|^O|ia|o1n2h2s?|at| }

|va|5|hc|saqj|at|This hand has 7 HCP in the form of the @SA, @SQ, and @SJ. |
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


lc|saqj|hs|ss|at|Add 2 long suit points for the 6-card spade suit and you come to 9 total points - enough to invite a game contract. While a 2NT rebid would suggest an invitational hand, it would be a mistake to rebid 2NT here. The 2NT rebid would suggest exactly 5 spades and you have a 6-card spade suit.

With this hand you are not particularly interested in playing in notrump. There will be an 8-card fit in spades even if your partner has only 2-card support for your 6-card suit (he cannot have a singleton or void in spades given that he opened the bidding with 1NT).


|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


ht|f|va|8|cs|1|at|^O|ia|o1n2h2s!3s|at| }

|va|5|at|








The correct rebid is 3@S. This bid describes an invitational hand with at least 6 cards in spades. Your partner will pass if he has a minimum hand and bid 4@S if he has a maximum hand.

|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ With an invitational hand containing a 6-card (or longer) major suit, transfer

|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
We have now covered all of the signoff and invitational sequences that the responder can use after he invokes a Jacoby transfer bid. In each of the remaining examples, the responder's hand will be strong enough to insist on playing in at least a game contract.

|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


ls|ss|ht|f|cs|3|at|^D{ |ih|psqj6haj873dk2c653|at|} {|va|8|cs|1|at|^O|ia|o1n2d2h?|at| }

|va|5|hc|sqjhajdk|at|This hand has 11 HCP |
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


lc|sqjhajdk|hs|sh|at|and a long suit point should be counted for the 5-card heart suit. 12 total points is more than enough to force to game opposite a 15-17 1NT opening bid, but not enough to explore for a possible slam contract. 

The only question that remains is which game contract rates to be best. If the 1NT opener has at least 3-card heart support, an 8-card major suit fit will be present and 4@H will probably be the best place to play. If the opener has only 2 hearts then 3NT will be the contract of choice.

|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


ht|f|va|8|cs|1|at|^O|ia|o1n2d2h!3n|at| }

|va|5|at|







Rebid 3NT. This bidding sequence describes a hand with exactly 5 hearts and enough strength to force to game. If the opener has only a doubleton heart, he will pass 3NT. Otherwise he will go on to 4@H. In either case you rate to end up in the best contract.

|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


cs|2|At|^-{ A Jacoby transfer followed by a 3NT rebid shows exactly 5 cards in the major and

|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|va|5|at|Here is another example of a hand with sufficient strength to force to game opposite a 1NT opening bid. As in the last example, the responder needs help in selecting the best contract.

lc|skqjdaq|hs|sssd|at|and 2 long suit points for the 2 5-card suits. With 14 total points, a game contract is certain, but it is far from clear from the responder's point of view which game contract rates to be best. Usually 3NT or 4@S will be right, but once in a while the partnership will belong in 5@D. Furthermore, it is possible that some small slam contract (or even a grand slam) will be a good bet if the opener's hand meshes well with these cards. 

|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |

at|Some bridge players mistakenly believe that when responder transfers and then bids a new suit he promises enough strength to suggest a slam contract. This sequence of bids does promise a good hand and the responder might have have slam interest. It is possible, however, for the responder to bid this way even for the sake of exploring for the best game contract. As we will soon see, there is one special sequence in which the bid of a new suit after a Jacoby transfer is not even forcing to game.

nt|^b@2^z@3|va|5|at|Sometimes when your partner opens the bidding with 1NT you know exactly what you want the final contract to be. That is the case with the following hand:

lc|sjhkqj|hs|sh|at|but the 3 long suit points counted for the 7-card heart suit result in this hand being worth 10 total points - enough to insist on a game contract opposite a 15-17 1NT opening bid. One of the nice things about this hand is that only one game contract is in the picture. You should insist on playing in 4@H since your heart suit is more than sufficient to make for a good trump suit even if your partner has a small doubleton in hearts.

If you were not using Jacoby transfer bids you would simply jump to 4@H over your partner's 1NT opening. You would arrive in the desired contract immediately, but the weak hand (yours) would end up as declarer. |

In the SAYC bidding system you can arrange for your partner (with his strong hand) to be the declarer by rebidding 4@H after your Jacoby transfer bid. This will have the effect of protecting his honor cards from attack on the opening lead.

After you transfer to 2@S to show your 5-card suit, rebid 4NT. This 4NT bid is not Blackwood - it is a quantitative raise similar to a direct 4NT response to a 1NT opening bid. As you will learn, there is another bidding sequence in SAYC that allows you to ask for Aces after showing a long major suit. Some bridge players might interpret the 4NT bid shown above as the Blackwood convention. They would be wrong in the SAYC bidding system!

If your partner has a minimum hand, he will either pass 4NT or correct the contract to 5@S (depending on his degree of support for your major). If your partner has a maximum hand, he will place the contract in either 6@S or 6NT (again depending on the number of spades he has).

Jacoby first wrote about using 2@D and 2@H responses to 1NT opening bids as transfers in 1956. In 1953-54, Olle Wilner, a Swedish bridge writer and player, wrote a series of articles on the subject. It is therefore not clear that Jacoby deserves credit for the brilliant convention that bears his name. }

at|Nowadays Jacoby transfers are just one of the many types of transfer bids used by expert players, but Jacoby transfers are the only type of transfer bids that have been embraced by average bridge players (and they are the only type of transfers in the SAYC bidding system). 

The basic concept of transfers (that is, a bid that asks your partner to bid a particular suit at a particular level) is a very powerful one. When a player invokes a transfer bid, he knows how the bidding is going to continue (at least most of the time) and this allows him to plan his next bid in advance. The fact that transfer bids tend to keep the bidding at a low level gives the player who invokes a transfer a lot of options when it is his turn to bid again.

Jacoby transfer bids are one of the most useful and effective conventions that have ever been devised, but these artificial bids are more complex than most of the conventions that are commonly used by average bridge players. Keep the following warning in mind when you learn any new convention, but be especially careful when the convention you learn has as many possible followup bids as do Jacoby transfers!

^-{ When responder has both majors }
^-
|cp||at|Bridge players use the term 2-suiter (or 2-suited hand) to describe a hand that has a suit with at least 5 cards in it and another suit with at least 4 cards in it. A major 2-suiter is a 2-suited hand in which spades and hearts (the majors) are the 2 long suits.

There are a few specially designed bidding sequences that the responder to a 1NT opening bid can use to describe various types of major 2-suiters. In some cases the responder starts by bidding Stayman and in other cases he uses a Jacoby transfer bid. The strength and exact distribution of the responder's hand determine which course of action he should take.

It is very likely, however, that either 2@S or 2@H will be a better contract than 1NT due to the unbalanced nature of the responder's hand. 

It would be nice if there was some way for the responder to ask the opener to choose between the majors, but there is no way to do this in SAYC. The responder simply has to take his best guess as to whether 2@S or 2@H will be a better contract.

ls|sssh|

nt|^b@2^z@3|va|5|at|We have now defined ways to handle just about any kind of major 2-suiter that you could ever be dealt opposite a 1NT opening bid. The SAYC bidding system has sequences for bidding 5-5 and 5-4 hands in the signoff, invitational, and game forcing ranges. Before we move on, here are a few more points that should be mentioned:

|
pg| ***** 150 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ With 6-5 (or better) in the majors facing a 1NT opening bid, the responder should 
 usually follow the same strategy that he would use if he had been dealt 5-5 in the majors. }
^-

cs|2|at|^-{ With 6-4 or 7-4 in the majors facing a 1NT opening bid, the responder should
 usually ignore his 4-card major and treat his hand as if it was a 1-suited hand. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 152 ***** |


at|When the responder has a 6-card (or longer) major suit and his partner opens the bidding with 1NT, he already knows that an 8-card major suit fit is present. In most cases there is not much point in exploring for another 8-card major suit fit for his 4-card major (by using Stayman for example). This is really a judgment situation, but the responder won't be too far off the mark if he always ignores his 4-card major when he also has a 6-card (or longer) major suit.

|
pg| ***** 153 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ With a weak major 2-suiter, the responder cannot afford to use Stayman because
 he will have no good rebid if the opener denies a 4-card major by bidding 2@D. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 154 ***** |


at|As we have seen, when the responder is not strong enough to issue a game invitation, he should transfer to his longest and strongest major and pass when his partner completes the transfer. Sometimes the partnership will end up in an inferior trump suit as a result, but it is too dangerous for the responder to explore for a better fit via Stayman. Everything would be OK if the opener rebid 2@H or 2@S, but the responder would be in trouble if the opener rebid 2@D.

^-{ Jacoby transfer bids - Review and Exercises }
^-
|cp||at|In this chapter you have been introduced to the Standard American Yellow Card (SAYC) bidding system. In the original Learn to Play Bridge program, the bidding system that was presented was referred to as Modern Standard American with 5-card majors. That bidding system was specifically designed for teaching new bridge players about bidding. 

SAYC on the other hand is arguably the most popular bidding system in the world today. Most of the bidding sequences that were discussed in Learn to Play Bridge have the same meanings that they would using SAYC. It is the case, however, that the SAYC bidding system is different than Modern Standard American with 5-card majors in some areas. One of the main areas of difference involves responding to a 1NT opening bid. In particular, Jacoby transfer bids are used in SAYC and this convention was never mentioned in the Learn to Play Bridge program.

pg| ***** 156 ***** |


at|In SAYC, the 2@D and 2@H responses to a 1NT opening bid are Jacoby transfer bids:

^D{|cs|1|ia|o1n!2d|at|} ^O{|cs|1|ia|o1n!2h|at|}

|
pg| ***** 157 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{ A Jacoby transfer bid promises at least 5 cards in the next higher-ranking (major) suit. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 158 ***** |


at|So in the first bidding sequence, the 2@D response to 1NT promises at least 5 hearts. In the second bidding sequence, the 2@H response to 1NT promises at least 5 spades.

nt|^b@2^z@3
As we have seen, Jacoby transfers are very flexible bids that can be used when the responder to a 1NT opening has a wide variety of hand types. The only constant about the type of hands that are appropriate for Jacoby transfer bids is that the responder must always have at least a 5-card major to use one of these bids.

|
pg| ***** 160 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ Jacoby transfer bids can be used with signoff hands, invitational hands, hands that are 
 strong enough to force to game, and hands that are strong enough to explore for slam. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 161 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ Jacoby transfer bids can be used with balanced hands, unbalanced 
 hands, hands with only 1 long suit, or hands with 2 or 3 long suits. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 162 ***** |


at|The 1NT opener does not have much to think about when his partner uses a Jacoby transfer:

nt|^b@2^z@3|ht|a|va|8|at|^D{|cs|1|ia|o1n2d!3h|at|} ^O{|cs|1|ia|o1n2h!3s|at|}

|cs|1|at|Super-accepting a Jacoby transfer bid can be dangerous because the responder could have a very weak hand for his transfer. That is one of the reasons why the opener should not super-accept very often - he should wait until he has both a maximum hand for his 1NT opener and 4-card support for the responder's major suit. There are 2 reasons why the opener should super-accept his partner's transfer under these circumstances:

|
pg| ***** 166 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{ 1) If the responder's hand was not quite strong enough to issue an invitation to game, 
 the responder might reconsider after the opener super-accepts his transfer. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 167 ***** |


cs|2|At|^-{ 2) If the responder has interest in a possible slam, the bidding will be easier for him if he 
 learns right away that his partner has a great hand in support of his long major suit. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 168 ***** |


at|Jacoby transfer bids are among the most popular conventions that have ever been devised. This is largely a function of how effective these bids are in practice. Here is one of the reasons why Jacoby transfers work so well:

|
pg| ***** 169 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ After a Jacoby transfer bid is used, the 1NT opener will become the
 declarer if the responder's long major suit becomes the trump suit. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 170 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|cs|1|at|
It may not have been immediately obvious why it is advantageous for the 1NT opening bidder rather than the responder to end up as the declarer, but we have explored this issue in some detail. This phenomena is not restricted to the bidding sequences that start with a 1NT opening bid. In general we have seen:

|
pg| ***** 171 ***** |


at|^-{ If a partnership has a choice as to which player will be the declarer, on most deals 
 it will be to their advantage to try to arrange for the stronger hand to be declarer. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 172 ***** |


at|The reason for this is that the opening lead gives the defenders a chance to attack a suit of their choice. Making the stronger hand the declarer (rather than the dummy) will often serve to protect the high cards in that hand from immediate attack.

|
pg| ***** 173 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{ One of the main advantages of using Jacoby transfer bids is that these bids allow the 
 partnership to protect the 1NT opener's high cards by making him the declarer more often. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 174 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ The word transfer is part of the name of Jacoby transfer bids because these bids 
 effectively transfer the declaration from the (weak) responder to the (strong) opener. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 175 ***** |


at|Allowing the 1NT opener to be declarer on a large percentage of hands is certainly a relevant advantage to using Jacoby transfer bids, but there is an even more important reason why these bids are effective in practice:

|
pg| ***** 176 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ After the 1NT opener completes the transfer, the responder 
 is well-placed to continue describing his hand with his next bid. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 177 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|va|5|at|There are a lot of things that the responder can do after the opener completes the transfer. Fortunately the responder's rebids all mean what you would expect.

|cs|1|ht|d|va|3|at|^D{|cs|1|ia|o1n2d2h?|at| } ^O{|cs|1|ia|o1n2h2s?|at| }

|
pg| ***** 178 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ To sign off in 2 of a major after a 1NT opening bid, transfer to your 5-card 
 (or longer) major suit and pass when your partner completes the transfer. }

|
pg| ***** 179 ***** |


cs|2|at|{ A Jacoby transfer followed by a 2NT rebid describes an 
 invitational hand with exactly 5 cards in responder's major. }

|
pg| ***** 180 ***** |


cs|4|at|{ With an invitational hand containing a 6-card (or longer) major suit, transfer

cs|1|at|{ A Jacoby transfer followed by a 3NT rebid shows exactly 5 cards in the major and

|
pg| ***** 182 ***** |


cs|3|at|{ To sign off in 4 of a long major after a 1NT opening bid, transfer to your 
 major and then rebid 4 of your major (which your partner will pass). }

|
pg| ***** 183 ***** |


cs|2|at|{ A Jacoby transfer bid followed by a 4NT rebid is not Blackwood - it is a quantitative try 
 for slam that is based on a balanced hand with exactly 5 cards in the major that was shown. }
|
pg| ***** 184 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
|cs|4|at|All of responder's possible rebids after the opener completes the transfer were covered on the last page except for those that involve the rebid of a new suit. The following principle that covers this case has only 1 exception (which we will review shortly):

|
pg| ***** 185 ***** |


at|^-{ A Jacoby transfer followed by the bid of a new suit is forcing to game and describes 
 a hand with at least a 5-card major and at least 4 cards in the new suit that was introduced. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 186 ***** |


at|For some reason this rebid by the responder after a Jacoby transfer causes confusion for some bridge players. It is important to understand the following 2 points about these bidding sequences:

|
pg| ***** 187 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ 1. A Jacoby transfer followed by the bid of a new suit does not necessarily 
 imply that the responder might have interest in playing in a slam contract. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 188 ***** |


at|Responder needs to have the strength to force to game (that is, 10 or more total points) in order to rebid a new suit after a Jacoby transfer. Many bridge players mistakenly think the responder must have slam interest in order to bid this way.

|
pg| ***** 189 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ 2. A Jacoby transfer followed by the bid of a new suit shows at least 4 cards in the new suit. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 190 ***** |


at|Some bridge players are under the wrong impression that when they bid this way, the new suit bid is actually a cuebid (as opposed to a possible trump suit). In other words, they might bid a new suit after their Jacoby transfer bid was completed in order to show the Ace of that suit in a hand with interest in slam. That would be a serious mistake. Responder's rebid of a new suit after a Jacoby transfer guarantees that he holds at least 4 cards in that suit.

|
pg| ***** 191 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|va|5|at|We then went on to consider how the responder should handle major 2-suiters with varying strengths and distributions after a 1NT opening bid by his partner. A major 2-suiter is any hand with at least 5 cards in one of the majors and at least 4 cards in the other major. Here are some general reminders of how the responder should select his first action with such hands:

|
pg| ***** 192 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{ With less than invitational strength, the responder should transfer to his longest 
 and strongest major suit and then pass when his partner completes the transfer. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 193 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ When the responder has exactly 5 cards in one major suit, 4 cards in the other 
 major suit, and at least invitational strength, he should start by using Stayman. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 194 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ When the responder has at least 5 cards in both major suits and at 
 least invitational strength, he should start with a Jacoby transfer bid. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 195 ***** |


at|Here is a more detailed decription of how the responder should bid with 5-5 or 5-4 in the majors when he has less than enough strength to invite game opposite a 1NT opening:

|
pg| ***** 196 ***** |


cs|1|At|^-{ With 5-5 in the majors and less than invitational strength, the responder to a 1NT opening
 should transfer to his stronger major and pass when his partner completes the transfer. }

|
pg| ***** 197 ***** |


cs|4|At|{ With 5-4 in the majors and less than invitational strength, the responder to a 1NT opening
 should transfer to his 5-card major and pass when his partner completes the transfer. }

|
pg| ***** 198 ***** |


cs|2|at|{ With a weak major 2-suiter, the responder cannot afford to use Stayman because
 he will have no good rebid if the opener denies a 4-card major by bidding 2@D. }
|
pg| ***** 199 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|va|5|at|When the responder to a 1NT opening has a major 2-suiter with at least invitational strength, he can afford to investigate the possibility of playing in both major suits. 
|
pg| ***** 200 ***** |


va|7|
cs|1|At|^-{ With 5-5 in the majors and invitational strength, the responder to a 1NT opening should 
 bid 2@D to transfer to hearts and rebid 2@S when his partner completes the transfer. }
^-|
pg| ***** 201 ***** |


va|7|
at|This special sequence is the one exception to a principle mentioned earlier. In all other cases, a Jacoby transfer bid followed by the rebid of a new suit by the responder is forcing to game. In this sequence, however, the bid of a new suit by the responder (2@S) is only invitational.
|
pg| ***** 202 ***** |


va|7|
cs|3|at|^-{ With 5-4 in the majors and invitational strength, the responder to a 1NT opening should 
 use Stayman, planning to raise 2@H or 2@S and to rebid 2 of his 5-card major over 2@D. }

|
pg| ***** 203 ***** |


cs|2|at|{ With 5-5 in the majors and enough strength to force to game opposite a 1NT opening,  
 bid 2@H to transfer to spades and rebid 3@H when your partner completes the transfer. }

|
pg| ***** 204 ***** |


cs|4|at|{ With 5-4 in the majors and game forcing strength, the responder to a 1NT opening should 
 use Stayman, planning to raise 2@H or 2@S and to rebid 3 of his 5-card major over 2@D. }
|
pg| ***** 205 ***** |


va|7|
at|^-Here are some guidelines for handling other major 2-suiters after a 1NT opening bid:
|
pg| ***** 206 ***** |


va|7|
cs|1|at|^-{ With 6-5 (or better) in the majors facing a 1NT opening bid, the responder should 
 usually follow the same strategy that he would use if he had been dealt 5-5 in the majors. }

|
pg| ***** 207 ***** |


cs|2|at|{ With 6-4 or 7-4 in the majors facing a 1NT opening bid, the responder should
 usually ignore his 4-card major and treat his hand as if it was a 1-suited hand. }

ls|sh|at|With such a weak hand with both majors, the prudent course of action is to transfer to the longer major suit.

pg| ***** 280 ***** |


at|Your partner will not have 2 doubletons given his 1NT opening bid so he must have at least 3-card support for at least one of your 5-card major suits. An 8-card major suit fit is certain to be present. You have described your hand well. Your partner can now decide on the trump suit.

at|Your partner will probably bid either 3NT (if he has only 2 spades) or 4@S (if he has 3-card support) at his next opportunity. Over 3NT you can place the contract in 6NT. If your partner's next bid is 4@S, you can jump to 6@S secure in the knowledge that an 8-card fit has been found. At this point in the bidding your partner does not know that your hand is so strong, but he will find out soon enough!|
