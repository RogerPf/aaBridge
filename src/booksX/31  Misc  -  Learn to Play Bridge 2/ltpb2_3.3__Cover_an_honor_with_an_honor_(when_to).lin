^-{ Always cover an honor with an honor (sometimes) }
^-|fp||cp||at|
It is time to turn our attention to a new guideline that will help you to make decisions on defense. The subject of this topic is perhaps the most famous defensive guideline of them all:

|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ Always cover an honor with an honor! }
^-
|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


at|Always cover an honor with an honor is also arguably the most dangerous guideline we have seen because it contains a very misleading word - ^*Ialways^*N. As you should know by now, words like ^*Ialways^*N and ^*Inever^*N do not apply in the game of bridge. 

Actually, that is not quite true. Here is an exception:

|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ Always think! Never treat guidelines as if they are rules! }
^-
|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


at|The word ^*Isometimes^*N has been added to the title of this topic in order to remind you that the word ^*Ialways^*N is what bridge players might call an overbid. Always cover an honor with an honor is a useful guideline, but as you will see there are plenty of situations where it should be rejected. Here is what this guideline means:

|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ If you, as a defender, are second to play to a trick and the first card played to 
 that trick is an honor, you should cover with a higher honor if you have one. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at|Note that this guideline contradicts (or at least supersedes) second hand low. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |

nt|^b@2^z@3If you have used the original Learn to Play Bridge program, you will be familiar with the concept of the pseudo-finesse which was discussed at length in that program. As an example of a pseudo-finesse, consider the lead of the @SQ by South. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


lc|sq|pc|sq|hc|sjt|at|If West plays the @SJ or the @S10 to this trick, |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


lc|sjt|pc|st|hc|s2|at|South will play a low spade from the dummy and his @SQ will win the trick. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


lc|s2|pc|ss|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


hc|sa|

nt|^b@2^z@3The @SA will still win a trick, of course, so South will end up with 2 spade tricks - an apparent victory for the pseudo-finesse! |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


lc|sa|hc|sk|up|3|at|Not so fast! As you probably know, the ^*Ipseudo^*N in pseudo-finesse means "false". South's play does not count as a real finesse because all West has to do is cover the @SQ with his @SK (covering an honor with an honor). |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


lc|sk|pc|sk|hc|sa|at|It doesn't matter if declarer wins the @SA or not - he has no hope of winning a second trick in spades anymore. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


lc|sa|up|1|hc|sk|

nt|^b@2^z@3The play of the @SQ by South is not a real finesse because it can never gain a trick against proper defense. As we just saw, if West has the @SK he will cover the @SQ |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


md|0,s9,,sk|at|and if East has the @SK instead, he will win the trick with that card. |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


lc|sk|pc|sssk|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


up|4|hc|s5sa|at|Meanwhile, South has a legitimate play for a second spade trick. All he has to do is lead a low spade to dummy's @SA |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


lc|s5sa|pc|sssas|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


hs|nsss|at|followed by a spade toward his @SQ. |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


ls|nsss|pc|s|hc|skq|at|If East has the @SK then the @SQ will score a trick. |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


lc|skq|up|5|md|0,sk,,s9|


nt|^b@2^z@3|ht|b|at|Recall the following principle that was introduced earlier in this chapter:
|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


ht|j|cs|2|at|^-{ Don't make a play that will succeed only if an opponent makes (or has made) a mistake! }
^-
|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


hc|sqk|ht|q|at|That's exactly what the @SQ amounts to here. This pseudo-finesse will only gain a trick if West errs by failing to cover with the @SK. Declarers should not take pseudo-finesses!
|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


lc|sk|

nt|^b@2^z@3If this particular declarer has not learned that pseudo-finesses are exercises in futility and leads the @SQ, |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


lc|sq|pc|sq|hs|ws|at|the fact that West has that card surrounded by the @SKJ (not to mention that the @S10 further strengthens his spade holding), |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


ls|ws|hc|sk|at|should make it easy for West to know that covering the @SQ with the @SK is the indicated play. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


lc|sk|hc|sjt|at|West should be able to foresee the danger of playing the @SJ or the @S10 to this trick.|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


lc|st|hc|sk|

nt|^b@2^z@3|va|5|at|Here is one time that you should cover an honor with an honor:
|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


ht|i|cs|4|at|^-{ Cover an honor with an honor when you know that by doing so you will promote an other 
 card that you hold into a winner. If your holding surrounds the honor that was led, cover it! }
^-
|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


lc|sk|hc|st|ht|v|at|Here West knows that the @SJ (and @S10) will come into their own |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


lc|sjt|hc|sk|at|if the @SK is played.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


lc|sk|hc|sjt|

nt|^b@2^z@3West's problem is much more difficult if, instead of the @SJ10 to back up his @SK, |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


lc|sjt|md|0,s643,,sjt|hc|s643|at|he has a bunch of small spades instead. |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


lc|s643|hs|es|at|Now East has all of the relevant middle spades |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


ls|es|hc|sk|at|and it is just as important for West to cover the @SQ with his @SK. If he does so, |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


lc|sk|pc|sk|hc|sa|at|the declarer will be able to come to only 1 spade trick (the @SA) regardless of how he plays from here. |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


lc|sa|up|1|hc|s3|at|If West plays a low spade instead of covering the @SQ with his @SK, |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


lc|s3|pc|s3|hc|s2|at|South will steal a second spade trick with his pseudo-finesse. |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


lc|s2|pc|s2s|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


up|3|hc|sk|hs|es|

nt|^b@2^z@3|va|5|at|Here is another good time to cover an honor with an honor:
|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


ht|i|cs|2|at|^-{ Cover an honor with an honor when you suspect that there is a good chance that, 
 by doing so, you will be able to promote a card that your partner holds into a winner.  }
^-
|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


ht|v|at|The tricky part is that you cannot see your partner's hand!|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


ls|es|

nt|^b@2^z@3Could it cost for West to play the @SK in this situation? |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


lc|sk|pc|sk|hs|sses|at|Yes, it could cost. One way to see this is by switching the South and East spade holdings. |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


ls|sses|md|0sjt9,,,s85|hc|sa|at|Once West covers the @SQ with his @SK, the declarer will win dummy's @SA |
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


lc|sa|pc|sas|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


hs|ss|at|and win 3 more spade tricks (for a total of 4) with the @SJ, @S10, and @S9 that remain in his hand. |
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


ls|ss|up|3|hc|s3|

nt|^b@2^z@3Now let's see what happens if West does not cover the @SQ with his @SK. |
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


lc|s3|pc|s3|hc|s2|at|The declarer will play low from the dummy and the @SQ will win the trick. |
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


lc|s2|pc|ss|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


hc|sj|at|South will lead another spade for a second finesse |
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


lc|sj|pc|sj|hc|s4|at|and, as before, West does best to withhold his @SK. |
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


lc|s4|pc|s4|hc|s7|at|Dummy's remaining low spade is played and South's @SJ wins the trick. |
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


lc|s7|pc|ss|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


hs|ssns|hc|s6|

nt|^b@2^z@3The dummy is now out of low spades so the declarer cannot finesse in that suit anymore. All he can do is play a spade to dummy's now singleton @SA. |
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


lc|s6|ls|nsss|pc|sss|md|0,,,h2|hs|eh|at|Let's give East something to discard so we can complete this trick. |
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


ls|eh|pc|h|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


hs|wsss|at|South has won 3 spade tricks, but he will not win a 4th trick in this suit since West has retained the @SK to guard South's remaining spade. |
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


ls|wsss|md|1sqjt9,sk643,sa72,s85|
hs|sses|

nt|^b@2^z@3So when the spades that West cannot see are distributed as above |
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


ls|sses|hc|sq|at|and South leads the @SQ (or any of his other 3 equal spades for that matter), |
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


lc|sq|pc|sq|hc|sk|at|West will give declarer an undeserved 4th spade winner if he covers an honor with an honor by playing his @SK. You now have concrete proof that the word ^*Ialways^*N does not belong in the guideline that we are studying!|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|hs|ns|va|5|at|Here is the lesson to be learned from this example:
|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


ht|i|cs|3|at|^-{ Cover an honor with an honor should usually be rejected if the declarer or dummy 
 is unable to run the suit that was led by taking repeated finesses against your honor. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


ht|v|lc|sk|hs|ws|at|Here your @SK is guarded by 3 small cards, but the declarer can take only 2 finesses. |
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


ls|wsns|up|1|hc|st|

nt|^b@2^z@3If we take South's @S10 and give it to East, |
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


lc|st|md|0,,,st|hc|sq|at|the resulting position illustrates another reason why, when South leads the @SQ, |
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


lc|sq|pc|sq|hc|sk|at|it could be costly for the defense to have West cover with the @SK. If West does so, |
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


lc|sk|pc|sk|hc|sa|At|the dummy's @SA will win the trick |
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


lc|sa|pc|sas|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


hs|sses|at|and South's remaining @SJ9 will allow him to take a successful finesse against East's @S10. South can win 2 more spade tricks for a total of 3 tricks in that suit |
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


ls|esss|hc|sk|up|3|at|as a result of West covering the @SQ with his @SK. |
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


lc|sk|hc|s3|

nt|^b@2^z@3Now look what happens if West refuses to cover the @SQ with his @SK. |
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


lc|s3|pc|s3|hc|s2|at|A low spade is played from the dummy and the @SQ wins the trick. |
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


lc|s2|pc|s2s|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


hc|s9|at|If South continues with the @S9, |
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


lc|s9|pc|s9|hc|s4|at|West plays low again |
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


lc|s4|pc|s4|hs|s7st|at|and if the @S7 is played from the dummy, East will win his @S10. |
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


ls|s7st|pc|s7st|
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


at|There is no way that South can win 3 spade tricks now! |
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


up|2|hc|Sa|at|If the declarer plays the @SA (instead of the @S7), he will win the trick, |
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


lc|sa|pc|sas|
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


hc|sk|at|but West's @SK will prevent South from winning a 3rd spade trick. |
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


lc|sk|up|4|hc|sj|

nt|^b@2^z@3Suppose South tries the @SJ (instead of the @S9) on the second round of spades. |
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


lc|sj|pc|sj|hs|skt|at|Now West can cover with the @SK (admittedly this is not an easy play to find since West cannot see the @S10) |
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


lc|skt|pc|sk|hc|sa|at|and the best South can do is to win the dummy's @SA. |
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


lc|Sa|pc|sas|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


hc|st|at|All of a sudden East's @S10 is the highest remaining spade in the deck and, as before, South will be held to 2 spade tricks. |
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


lc|st|up|7|hc|sk|at|West's refusal to cover the @SQ with his @SK on the first round of the suit saves a trick for the defense.|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|hc|st|hs|ss|va|5|at|This example demonstrates the following instructive point:
|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


ht|i|cs|1|at|^-{ Cover an honor with an honor should usually be rejected if doing so 
 will set up a finessing position against a card in your partner's hand. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


ht|v|at|Again, it is hard to judge when this advice applies, since you cannot see your partner's hand!|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


up|1|lc|st|lc|sk|ls|ss|hs|ss|hs|es|

nt|^b@2^z@3As we have seen, in both this layout of the unseen spades |
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


md|0st|at|and the layout now shown above, |
pg| ***** 94 ***** |


ls|esss|hc|sq|at|when South leads the @SQ |
pg| ***** 95 ***** |


lc|sq|pc|sq|hc|sk|at|it is best for the defense if West refuses to cover an honor with an honor. |
pg| ***** 96 ***** |


md|0s85,,,sjt9|hs|sses|at|To be fair, we did see a layout where covering the @SQ with the @SK gained a trick for the defense. The big question is: how can West know if he should play his @SK in this situation when he cannot see the South and East hands?|
pg| ***** 97 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3You may be disappointed by the answer to this big question: West cannot know for sure. The only thing that West has to go on is the knowledge that South would be taking a pseudo-finesse if the unseen spades were distributed as above. A pseudo-finesse is a poor play and West should not play South to be making a mistake like this. |
pg| ***** 98 ***** |


lc|sk|hc|s3|md|0sjt9,,,s85|

nt|^b@2^z@3This argues for West playing a small spade instead of covering the @SQ with his @SK. It is much more likely that the spades are distributed something like what you now see above (where the @SQ is a good play for declarer to make) |
pg| ***** 99 ***** |


md|0s85,,,sjt9|at|than that the spade layout is such that the declarer is attempting a pseudo-finesse (a very poor play). |
pg| ***** 100 ***** |


ls|sses|hc|sk|

nt|^b@2^z@3Sometimes there will be clues available from the bidding (or from East's signals) that can help West to decide if he should play the @SK or not, but on some deals West can do no better than to fall back on the following piece of advice (which we have seen before): 
|
pg| ***** 101 ***** |


ht|t|cs|4|at|^-{ Don't make a play that will succeed only if an opponent makes (or has made) a mistake! }
^-
|
pg| ***** 102 ***** |


md|3,,hj63,hq52|lc|sk3|
hc|hj|

nt|^b@2^z@3Consider this situation where the declarer leads the @HJ from the dummy. |
pg| ***** 103 ***** |


lc|hj|pc|hj|hc|hq|at|There are several possible layouts where East's best play is to cover the @HJ with the @HQ. |
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


lc|hq|pc|hq|md|0hat87,hk94|hs|shwh|at|For example, consider this distribution of the unseen hearts. |
pg| ***** 105 ***** |


ls|shwh|hc|ha|at|The declarer can take East's @HQ with his @HA, |
pg| ***** 106 ***** |


lc|ha|pc|hah|
pg| ***** 107 ***** |


hs|wh|hc|ht|at|but West's @HK9 sitting over South's @H10 will represent 2 heart winners for the defense. |
pg| ***** 108 ***** |


up|3|ls|wh|lc|ht|hc|h2|

nt|^b@2^z@3If East had followed suit with a small heart (instead of covering the @HJ with his @HQ), |
pg| ***** 109 ***** |


lc|h2|pc|h2|hc|h7hk|at|South would play low from his hand and West's @HK would win the trick. |
pg| ***** 110 ***** |


lc|h7k|pc|h7hk|
pg| ***** 111 ***** |


wt|n|hs|nhsh|hc|hq|at|The next time the lead is in the dummy, South can finesse against East's @HQ by playing low to his @H10. |
pg| ***** 112 ***** |


ls|nhsh|lc|hq|pc|hhhth|
pg| ***** 113 ***** |


hc|ha|hs|ehwh|at|The @HA will take care of all of the defenders' remaining hearts. |
pg| ***** 114 ***** |


ls|ehwh|lc|ha|pc|hahhh|
pg| ***** 115 ***** |


at|The defense is thus held to 1 heart trick (instead of 2) |
pg| ***** 116 ***** |


up|11|hc|hq|at|due to East's failure to cover the @HJ with his @HQ on the first round of the suit. |
pg| ***** 117 ***** |


lc|hq|md|0hk9,ht7|
hs|whsh|

nt|^b@2^z@3Here is another possible layout of the South and West hearts |
pg| ***** 118 ***** |


ls|shwh|hc|hq|at|where East must cover the @HJ or else lose a trick that the defense is entitled to. |
pg| ***** 119 ***** |


lc|hq|pc|hq|hc|hak|at|South will win the trick |
pg| ***** 120 ***** |


lc|hak|pc|hah|
pg| ***** 121 ***** |


wt|n|hs|nhsh|hc|ht|at|and return to the dummy with some other suit in order to attempt a finesse against the @H10 with East (South cannot see that West actually has that card). |
pg| ***** 122 ***** |


ls|nhsh|lc|ht|pc|hhh9|hc|ht|at|On this layout, West can win the @H10. |
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


lc|ht|pc|ht|at|That will be the one and only heart trick for the defense. |
pg| ***** 124 ***** |


up|7|hc|hq|

nt|^b@2^z@3One trick may not sound like much, but it is much better than none! None is exactly the number of heart tricks that the defense will take if East fails to cover the @HJ with the @HQ on the first trick. |
pg| ***** 125 ***** |


lc|hq|hc|h2|at|If East follows small, |
pg| ***** 126 ***** |


lc|h2|pc|H2|hc|h8|at|South will also play a small heart and the @HJ will win the trick. |
pg| ***** 127 ***** |


lc|h8|pc|h8h|
pg| ***** 128 ***** |


hc|hak|hs|ehwh|at|All the remaining East-West hearts will fall under the @HA and @HK, leaving the defense with no chance to win a trick in this suit. |
pg| ***** 129 ***** |


up|3|ls|ehwh|lc|hak|hc|hq|

nt|^b@2^z@3There are several other possible layouts where it will help the defense if East covers an honor with an honor by playing his @HQ when the @HJ is led from the dummy. There are a few possible layouts where playing the @HQ in this position will cost the defense and there are other layouts in which it does not matter if East covers or not.|
pg| ***** 130 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3There are 2 reasons why it is a good idea for East to play his @HQ in this situation. |
pg| ***** 131 ***** |


hc|ht|at|First, playing the @HQ may result in a heart in West's hand being promoted into a winner (which is what happens to the @H10 on this layout). |
pg| ***** 132 ***** |


lc|ht|at|Second, if East is not going to win a trick with his @HQ, the best he can do is use that card to blot out a card that may be of value to the declarer (the @HJ in this case). |
pg| ***** 133 ***** |


up|1|hc|hj|

nt|^b@2^z@3|ht|d|cs|2|at|^-{ Usually when an unsupported honor is led from the dummy and the partner of the 
 opening leader has a higher honor, covering will be an effective play for the defense. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 134 ***** |


lc|hq|ht|q|at|The @HJ is said to be unsupported in this situation because it is not backed up by the next lower touching honor (that is, the @H10). Things would be different if the @H10 was in the dummy. |
pg| ***** 135 ***** |


lc|hj|md|1dj83,dkt95,dq62,da74|hs|ndsdwded|

nt|^b@2^z@3It is time to revisit a card combination that arose when we were considering second hand low. |
pg| ***** 136 ***** |


ls|ndsdwded|hc|d3|at|Recall that when South started by leading a small diamond from his hand, |
pg| ***** 137 ***** |

hs|ss|at|The reason is that he cannot see the holding of the third hand to play.

nt|^b@2^z@3In conclusion, when the @SQ is led from dummy, |

ls|nhsheh|up|3|hc|hk|hs|nh|

nt|^b@2^z@3Remember that the main reason to cover an honor with an honor is to promote smaller cards in either your hand or your partner's hand into winners. The sight of the dummy's powerful hearts should be enough to convince East that this will not happen if he covers the @HQ with his @HK. |

lc|hk|hc|h3|at|East should therefore play second hand low. At worst this play will break even, but as we just saw, there are layouts where playing second hand low will save a trick for the defense.|

nt|^b@2^z@3It is unusual to find yourself defending against a slam contract when you have 11 high card points, but that is the situation that you find yourself in on this example deal. South, the dealer,opened the bidding with 1@S. North responded 2@C and South rebid 2@D. North rebid 2@S and South then jumped all the way to 6@S which became the final contract. |

lc|ckskhkq|

nt|^b@2^z@3It is true that quadruple jumps (like South's 6@S) are more common in figure skating than they are in bridge. In this case South's exuberance can be explained by where this deal took place. It happened shortly after midnight at a New Year's Eve party for bridge players. South, who had enjoyed a few drinks over the course of the evening, wanted to be the first bridge player to bid and make a slam in the new year! It's up to you and your partner to stop him!|

nt|^b@2^z@3This problem is very solvable. You started with 3 hearts and the dummy started with 4 hearts. South, playing 5-card majors, promised at least 5 hearts when he opened the bidding 1@H.

|cp||at|By now you should know that the ^*Ialways^*N that traditionally appears in always cover an honor with an honor is misleading. There are times and places for cover an honor with an honor, but there are also plenty of situations where this guideline should be rejected in favor of second hand low. As was mentioned at the start of this topic, just about the only use of ^*Ialways^*N and ^*Inever^*N in bridge is the following:

|
pg| ***** 495 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{ Always think! Never treat guidelines as if they are rules! }
^-
|
pg| ***** 496 ***** |


at|Here is a reminder of what is meant by cover an honor with an honor:

|
pg| ***** 497 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ If you, as a defender, are second to play to a trick and the first card played to 
 that trick is an honor, you should cover with a higher honor if you have one. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 498 ***** |


at|The whole purpose of cover an honor with an honor is to promote smaller cards in either your hand or your partner's hand into winners.

|
pg| ***** 499 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ Cover an honor with an honor when you know that you will promote a card that you
 hold into a winner by doing so. If your holding surrounds the honor that was led, cover it! }

pg| ***** 500 ***** |

 by doing so, you will be able to promote a card that your partner holds into a winner.  }
^-

pg| ***** 501 ***** |


tb||

nt|^b@2^z@3
Here are some other guidelines that describe situations where it is usually best for the defense to cover an honor with an honor:

|
pg| ***** 502 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{ Usually when an unsupported honor is led from the dummy and the partner of the 
 opening leader has a higher honor, covering will be an effective play for the defense. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 503 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ Cover an honor with an honor is often good advice when you are dealt a doubleton honor. 
 By covering in these situations you ensure that your honor is used to capture a relevant card. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 504 ***** |


at|The above guideline generally supersedes the following guideline:

|
pg| ***** 505 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ When the dummy has 2 or more touching honors, it is usually best for the partner of the 
 opening leader to wait until the last of these is played before he covers with a higher honor. }

|
pg| ***** 506 ***** |


at|^-Here are some situations in which you should not cover an honor with an honor. The first of these ties in with the guideline mentioned above:

|
pg| ***** 507 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ Cover an honor with an honor should usually be rejected if doing so 
 will set up a finessing position against a card in your partner's hand. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 508 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{Do not cover an honor with an honor if you know that dummy has to play a higher honor!}
^-
|
pg| ***** 509 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ Cover an honor with an honor should usually be rejected if the declarer or dummy 
 is unable to run the suit that was led by taking repeated finesses against your honor. }
^-|
pg| ***** 510 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
Here is a reminder that, in some situations, there is no clearly right play for the defense when the declarer leads an honor out of his hand or off the dummy:

|
pg| ***** 511 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{Both the opening leader and his partner sometimes can be faced with a guess as to whether
  second hand low or cover an honor with an honor will work out better for the defense. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 512 ***** |


cs|2|at|There are several ways in which a defender can try to resolve these guesses:

|
pg| ***** 513 ***** |


at|^-{ The bidding can help a defender to know if he should cover an honor with an honor. 
 Drawing inferences from partner's signals and how declarer has played can also help. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 514 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{ The defenders should assume that the declarer is not taking a pseudo-finesse. 
 Pseudo-finesses are very bad plays and most declarers are aware of this fact! }
^-
|
pg| ***** 515 ***** |


at|It is almost always a serious mistake for a declarer to take a pseudo-finesse and, as we have seen, the defenders should assume that the declarer has good reasons for the plays that he chooses to make (and vice versa). Here is a refined policy that describes how you should think about the possibility of an opponent making an error:

|
pg| ***** 516 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ If you have nothing to lose by giving an opponent a chance to err, then you should do so,
 but you should favor a legitimate play over a play that will work ^*Ionly^*N if a mistake is made. }
^-

pg| ***** 517 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ Experienced declarers know all kinds of clever ways to try to induce the defenders 
 to err. The good news is that most defenders will fall into each of these traps only once! }

lc|hkht|hc|h5|

nt|^b@2^z@3The way to come up with the right solution to this problem (playing second hand low) is to realize that since dummy was dealt only 1 card in hearts, the declarer will be able to take only 1 finesse in that suit. |
pg| ***** 675 ***** |


lc|h5|hs|eh|at|Your @HK is guarded by 2 small cards so the declarer would have to be able to take 2 heart finesses in order to prevent the @HK from scoring a trick. |

lc|dj|

nt|^b@2^z@3You should play second hand low. Do you remember the principle you learned that when the dummy has 2 (or more) touching honors, the partner of the opening leader should cover the last of these (unless he was dealt a doubleton)? |
pg| ***** 681 ***** |


hc|d9|at|That principle applies here even though the @D9 is not really an honor card. The fact that it is touching the @D10 (which is an honor card) means that the @D10 and the @D9 are equals.|
pg| ***** 682 ***** |


lc|d9|md|0dk32,daq75|lc|d9d4|hs|sdwd|

nt|^b@2^z@3Here is one possible layout of the missing diamonds |
pg| ***** 683 ***** |


ls|sdwd|hc|d4|at|where East's proper second hand low play saves a trick for the defense. |
pg| ***** 684 ***** |


lc|D4|pc|d4|hc|d2|at|There is now no way for South to come to a winner in diamonds. His best shot is to play low from his hand, |
pg| ***** 685 ***** |

pg| ***** 686 ***** |

lc|d9|pc|d9|hc|dj|at|Cover with your @DJ |
pg| ***** 689 ***** |


lc|dj|pc|dj|hs|sd|at|and South will not win a trick regardless of the diamond that he plays from his hand. |

wt|s|hs|ndsd|hc|dq|at|Later in the play, South will be able to lead a second round of diamonds toward the dummy's remaining @D96. It won't matter if West takes his @DQ or not - the @D9 will win a trick for declarer sooner or later. |

nt|^b@2^z@3In this problem South has opened the bidding with a 3@C preempt to suggest a strong 7-card club suit. 3@C is the final contract and, after winning West's opening lead in the dummy, the declarer (who you know is a crafty player) calls for the @CJ. |
pg| ***** 697 ***** |


lc|cj|pc|cj|hc|cq5|at|Would you cover an honor with an honor by playing the @CQ or play second hand low instead?|

nt|^b@2^z@3You should play second hand low. This is the hardest problem in this section so don't be at all concerned if you got it wrong! For that matter, you should not be concerned if you got any of these problems wrong - as long as you understand the reasoning behind the right answers you will have a good chance to play the right card when these situations arise at the table. |

lc|c5|hc|cqt|

nt|^b@2^z@3At first glance it appears obvious to cover the @CJ with the @CQ here since your @CQ10 surround the @CJ. This appears to be a situation that is tailor-made for promotion. |
pg| ***** 701 ***** |


lc|cqt|md|0cak98762|hs|sc|at|Take a second glance and consider how the rest of the clubs are laid out. Both you and the dummy started with 3 clubs and South's bidding promised a 7-card club suit. South must have all of the 7 unseen clubs, leaving your partner with a void in that suit. |
