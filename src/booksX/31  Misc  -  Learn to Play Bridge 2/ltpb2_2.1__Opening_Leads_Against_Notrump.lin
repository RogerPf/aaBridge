cs|5|cp|6|fp|4|at|^-{ Introduction to Chapter 2 }
^-
|fp||cp||at|The original Learn To Play Bridge program focused mostly on declarer play and bidding. Defense, the third critical aspect of playing bridge, was largely ignored in that program due to considerations of size and comprehension.

Given that you already know how to play bridge and that you would like to improve your game, defense cannot be ignored any longer. About half of the material in this program, the sequel to Learn to Play Bridge, is about defense. By the time you have gone through the 3 chapters on defense that are contained in this program, you will be ready for just about anything that could arise at the bridge table!

Defense at bridge is a very important skill to master for one simple reason:

|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ You will end up as a defender on roughly half of the bridge deals that you ever play! }
^-
|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


at|It's true. When the cards have been dealt, each of the 4 players are equally likely to become the declarer. You will be the declarer on approximately one quarter of the bridge deals that you will play. Your partner will also be the declarer about one quarter of the time. For the remaining half of the deals that come up in your career as a bridge player, you are going to be a defender.

Most people who learn to play bridge are bridge players for life. Hopefully you will be both alive and playing bridge for many years to come! If so, you are going to be defending a lot of bridge deals so you had better learn what defense at bridge is all about.

First a warning:

|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ The majority of bridge experts consider defense to be the most difficult part of the game. }
^-
This warning is not meant to scare you, but it is only fair that you know that some challenges lie ahead. If it will make you feel any better, there are plenty of experts who would argue that mastering bidding and/or declarer play is at least as difficult as learning how to defend well.

|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|Now a promise:

|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ Defense is hard, but it is worth the effort that it takes to learn to defend well. Working with 
 your partner on defense to defeat the declarer's contract is a very satisfying experience! }
^-
|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|As you have already learned, figuring out which is the best card to play when you are the declarer can be a challenging exercise in logic. Deciding on the best card to play as a defender can also involve some complex problem solving, but while declarer play is largely an individual exercise, the partnership aspect of defense is extremely important.

|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ When you are the declarer, your partner (the dummy) just sits and admires your skills! }

|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


cs|4|at|{ Defense is all about teamwork! For the defense to be effective, both members of the 
 partnership must learn to work together toward the same objective: defeat the contract! }
|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
Defense at bridge is fun because it encompasses the best parts of the other 2 main aspects of the game. A defender is faced with the same sort of technical challenges that the declarer is presented with, but being able to communicate effectively with your partner (a skill that is central to bidding) is also a cornerstone of sound defense.

Besides the partnership aspect of defense, there is another factor that makes this part of bridge very different (and often more difficult) than playing a hand as declarer:

|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ As the declarer, you know about all of the assets that your partnership has been 
 dealt (because you can see both your own hand and the cards in the dummy). }

|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


cs|2|at|{ As a defender, this is not the case. You can see your own hand and you will be able  
 to see the dummy after the opening lead, but you cannot see your partner's cards! }
^-
|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


at|The fact that the declarer can see all of the partnership's cards is important. For example, in a notrump contract, the declarer will know which suits represent the best chances for winning tricks. If there is a trump suit, the declarer has all the information he needs to know regarding whether or not he should try for a ruff in either the dummy or in his own hand.|va|8|at|
The same is not true on defense. Since a defender cannot see his partner's hand, he will often have no idea which of his partner's suits contain length or strength (that is, which suits can be used to develop defensive tricks at notrump). Similarly, a defender will often have to guess whether or not he should try for a ruff (or try to give his partner a ruff). It is hard to give your partner a ruff on defense unless you know that he is both void in a given suit and not void in trump!

^-{ Opening leads against notrump contracts }
^-
|fp||cp||at|As you just learned, many bridge experts consider defense to be the most difficult part of the game of bridge. One of the main reasons why defense can be difficult is that, unlike the declarer, the defenders cannot see their partners' hands. Not knowing the partnership's combined assets (in terms of long suits and high cards) often makes it hard to know which suit(s) represent potential sources of tricks for the defense.

Once the opening lead has been made, both defenders are able to look at the dummy. On many deals, the sight of the dummy will offer clues as to the best course of action on defense.

|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ The opening leader has the unique problem of having to select a card to play without 
 even being able to see the dummy. The opening leader often feels as if he is in the dark! }
^-
For this reason, the process of selecting the best opening lead on a given hand is far from easy. Still, this is a logical place to begin the study of defense at bridge. After all, every bridge deal contains an opening lead (except for passouts of course) and you will find that you will be the opening leader on roughly one quarter of the bridge deals that you play.

The opening lead is the first chance the defense has to strike a blow against the declarer and on many deals the opening lead will force the defenders down a particular path. An effective opening lead will often make the difference between the success and the failure of a contract. 

|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ Make no mistake about this: opening leads are ^*Ivery^*N important! }

|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


tb||

nt|^b@2^z@3
In this program, the study of opening leads has been broken down into 2 topics: opening leads against notrump contracts and opening leads against trump contracts. Selecting the best opening lead when there is no trump suit is usually easier (since ruffs need not be considered) so we will start our discussion there.

While the defenders and the declarer have completely opposite objectives (the declarer tries to win enough tricks to make the contract while the defenders try to prevent this from happening), many of the techniques that you are familiar with from your studies of declarer play can also be applied to defense.

|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ In particular, you have learned that the declarer in a notrump contract should 
 often try to establish winners in long suits in his own hand and/or in the dummy. }

|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


cs|1|at|{ The same principle applies when defending against a notrump contract. 
 The defenders should try to establish winners in their long suits. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


at|In a sense, this is easier said than done. Since the opening leader cannot even see the dummy (let alone his partner's hand), he will often have a difficult time knowing which suit represents the defenders' best chance for establishing winners. Still, the opening leader has to do the best that he can. On many deals the opening lead amounts to little more than a guess, but the following piece of advice will take you a long way toward making good opening leads against notrump contracts:

|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{ Against a notrump contract it is often best to lead from your longest and strongest suit. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|cs|3|at|
Consider the following hand as an example:

|ht|c|va|5|at|^D{|ih|pst98765h32ckq2da2|at|}|ht|c|va|5|cs|1|at|^M{|ia|   1np3nppp|at|}

South, the dealer, opened the bidding with 1NT and was raised to 3NT by North. Imagine that you are sitting West and that you hold the hand shown above. You have to select an opening lead. What suit would you lead from?

|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


hs|sd|at|Let's consider each of the 4 suits. The diamond suit contains your one and only Ace. The nice thing about leading an Ace against a notrump contract is that you will certainly win the trick as there is no way that the declarer will be able to ruff!

Experience has shown, however, that the opening lead of an Ace against a notrump contract is rarely a good start for the defense. There are 3 good reasons for this:

|cs|4|at|^-{ 1) Aces rarely "go away". Save your Ace for later. You will still win a trick with it. }

|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


cs|2|at|{ 2) The @DA might be a useful entry for regaining the lead later in the play. }

|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


cs|1|at|{ 3) It would be nice if the declarer had to use a high diamond (like the @DK) to force your @DA! }
|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|ls|sd|hs|sc|cs|3|at|
How about leading a club?

|ht|c|va|5|at|^D{|ih|pst98765h32ckq2da2|at|}|ht|c|va|5|cs|1|at|^M{|ia|   1np3nppp|at|}

You have both the @CK and the @CQ. If your partner has the @CA then the defense can win at least 3 tricks in the club suit. It is more likely that either the declarer or the dummy has the @CA (because their bidding suggests that they hold most of the outstanding high cards), but leading a high club might still work out well.

Suppose that declarer was dealt the @CA and that you select either the @CK (or the @CQ) as your opening lead. If declarer ducks his @CA you will have won a trick and if declarer wins the @CA you will have established a winner in clubs. You will almost certainly be able to win a future trick with the @DA and cash the club trick that your clever lead set up.

On the surface this seems like a good plan, but...

|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ You do not have a long club suit and the bidding gives you no reason to believe that your 
 partner has a long club suit either. Remember, leading long suits at notrump is the way to go!}
|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|ls|sc|hs|sh|cs|3|at|
Hearts anyone?

|ht|c|va|5|at|^D{|ih|pst98765h32ckq2da2|at|}|ht|c|va|5|cs|1|at|^M{|ia|   1np3nppp|at|}

By now you should understand that a heart would make an unattractive opening lead from this hand. Hearts is your shortest and weakest suit and leading a heart is completely contrary to the principle of selecting an opening lead from your longest and strongest suit.

|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


ls|sh|hs|ss|at|The only suit left to consider is the spade suit and, as you have probably guessed, the opening lead of a spade represents your best chance to defeat the contract. It is not a coincidence that spades happens to be your longest suit.

That doesn't mean that you necessarily will defeat the contract after selecting a spade as an opening lead. It is not at all unlikely that 3NT will succeed regardless of what you lead. In addition, it is entirely possible that any of the other 3 suits could turn out to be a more effective opening lead than a spade. 

|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


cs|2|at|^-{ Choosing an opening lead is not an exact science. 
Opening leads do not come with any guarantees! }

nt|^b@2^z@3Let's have a look at how the recommended spade opening lead might lead to the defeat of South's 3NT contract. First an important question: Which spade to lead? |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


at|From a trick-taking point of view it does not matter which spade you lead. All 6 of West's spades are touching each other. In poker West's spades would be called a 6-card straight flush. In bridge they are called equals. |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Despite the fact that all 6 of West's spades are equals, there is a correct spade to lead. |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


ls|ws|hc|st|at|The reason why the @S10 is the proper lead is part of an important principle of defense at bridge:

|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ Good defenders use the cards that they play for more than just winning tricks. 
Some cards can be signals used to tell your partner more about your hand. }|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|ht|c|cs|2|at|^-{ Remember, just as you cannot see your partner's hand when you are defending, he 
 cannot see your hand either. The cards that you play can help partner to visualize your hand. }
|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


ht|q|cs|1|at|{ If your partnership makes agreements about which cards will always be led from certain 
 holdings (and if you follow these agreements) defense becomes a whole lot easier! }
^-
|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Hopefully this important principle makes some sense to you. If not, don't worry as we will be exploring the concept of signaling on defense in much greater detail before too long.

Even if you fully understand the concept of signaling, it is not clear why the @S10 is the proper spade to lead. What makes the @S10 a better signal than any of West's other spades?|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|cs|1|ht|c|at|^-{ The main reason why the @S10 is the proper spade to lead is that most bridge players always
 lead the 10 from a suit headed by the 1098. The @S10 is what is known as a standard lead. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


at|There are tables of standard leads from various holdings. If you and your partner are both familiar with the standard leads, you will be able to draw inferences from each others' leads. |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Later in this chapter the table of standard leads will be presented (don't worry - it is not difficult to memorize). The main purpose of the current lesson, however, is to learn which suit to lead against a notrump contract, not which card to lead from that suit.

Let's see how a spade opening lead might work out in practice.

|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|lc|st|pc|st|hs|nd|hs|wd|at|Suppose you lead the @S10. The sight of all of the diamonds in the dummy makes it clear that the @DA would not have been a very good opening lead on this deal. It is true that you would have won the first trick if you had led the @DA, but you would have set up 5 diamond tricks for the declarer in the process. You will see very soon that saving the @DA to win a later trick was a very good idea!

|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


ls|wd|ls|nd|hs|ns|

nt|^b@2^z@3The declarer calls for the @S4 from the dummy |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


ls|ns|pc|s4|pc|sa|at|and your partner plays the @SA. That's nice - your partner is going to win the first trick. |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


pc|sj|at|The declarer follows suit with the @SJ. That's a pretty high spade. Why do you suppose that the declarer wasted the @SJ instead of following suit with a lower spade?|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|pc|s3|at|Your partner leads the @S3 to the second trick. As we will see, returning the suit that your partner led is generally a good strategy on defense. |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


pc|sk|at|The mystery of why declarer played the @SJ on the first trick is cleared up when he follows with the @SK to the second trick. |
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


hs|ns|at|The @SK is going to win this trick, but the dummy's @SQ will be gobbled up in the process. The declarer would not be wasting his spades like this unless he had no choice in the matter. |

hs|ws|

nt|^b@2^z@3Did you notice that all of your spades are now winners. It is true that the @S9 is not a high spade, but all of the higher spades are gone (your partner played the @SA at trick 1, declarer has played the @SK and @SJ, the dummy has played the @SQ, and your opening lead was the @S10). |
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


at|If you are able to regain the lead then you are going to be able to win 4 more tricks in spades! |
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


ls|ws|pc|dj|hs|nd|hs|wd|

nt|^b@2^z@3It turns out that the chance to regain the lead presents itself immediately. Declarer leads the @DJ out of his hand, apparently in an attempt to establish some diamond tricks in the dummy. The rest of the defense of this deal will be a pleasure. After winning the trick with the @DA, |

nt|^b@2^z@3It is the case that the @S10 is the proper opening lead from the West hand and on this deal West will be rewarded if he leads well.

pg| ***** 79 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|

nt|^b@2^z@3
One of the main reasons why a spade opening lead was so effective on this deal was because both the declarer and the dummy held only 2 cards in spades. As a result, there was only 1 spade stopper between the North-South hands, despite the possession of the @SK, @SQ, and @SJ. |

nt|^b@2^z@3The effect of putting a third spade in the South hand, even though it was only the @S2, was that North-South now had 2 stoppers in spades (instead of the 1 stopper that they had when they both were dealt 2 spades). |
pg| ***** 100 ***** |


at|Does that mean that the @S10 was not such a good opening lead after all? |
pg| ***** 101 ***** |


at|No. All this proves is that selecting an opening lead is not an exact science. There are no guarantees that the recommended opening lead will be effective on the actual deal.|

nt|^b@2^z@3So when the North-South cards are distributed as above, the recommended spade opening lead is not nearly as effective as a club opening lead. Actually this is not strictly the case since it is possible for the defenders to recover after West leads a spade. The details will not be discussed now as they are not really relevant to the current lesson. |
pg| ***** 119 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3The lesson to be learned here is this:

|cs|1|at|^-{ The "correct opening lead" will not always be the most successful opening lead on the actual
 deal. Guidelines are available for selecting an opening lead, but there are no guarantees. }

nt|^b@2^z@3|va|4|at|Here is a summary of what we have learned so far regarding opening leads:

|
pg| ***** 121 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ You will be the opening leader on about one quarter of all of the bridge deals that you 
 ever play. Get used to being the opening leader as you will be in that position a lot! }

|
pg| ***** 122 ***** |


cs|4|at|{ The choice of opening leads will often determine whether or not the declarer 
 will make his contract. That is why it is important to study opening leads! }

|
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


cs|2|at|{ Selecting the winning opening lead is difficult because you can see only your own 13 cards 
 when your decision has to be made. On some deals the bidding will help you to select a lead. }

|
pg| ***** 124 ***** |


cs|3|at|{ There are different strategies for selecting an opening lead depending on whether or not a 
 trump suit exists. The focus of our study so far has been leading against notrump contracts. }

|
pg| ***** 125 ***** |


cs|1|at|{ Against a notrump contract it is usually a good strategy to select an opening lead from
 your longest and strongest suit. Some exceptions will be mentioned later in this chapter. }

|
pg| ***** 126 ***** |


cs|4|at|{ Once you decide which suit to make your opening lead from, you have to decide which card
 in that suit to lead. A table of standard leads is available to help you resolve this decision. }

|
pg| ***** 127 ***** |


cs|2|at|{ It is important to always lead the same card from the same holding so that your partner can 
 draw inferences from the card that you led. This will make it easier for your partner to defend. }

|
pg| ***** 128 ***** |


cs|3|at|{ A bridge book or teacher can recommend an opening lead for a given hand, but the 
 suggested lead may not work on the actual deal. Opening leads come with no guarantees. }

nt|^b@2^z@3
You are West again in this example deal. Get used to being West during these lessons on opening leads. In bridge literature the declarer traditionally sits South which puts West on opening lead. |
pg| ***** 130 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3The bidding on this deal is the same as it was on the first example deal. South opened 1NT as the dealer and North raised to 3NT which became the final contract. You will see this bidding sequence a lot, both in this program and when you are playing bridge. 1NT-3NT is one of the most common bidding sequences in bridge. |
pg| ***** 131 ***** |


hs|wswhwc|

nt|^b@2^z@3It is up to you to select an opening lead. We have already learned that it is considered good strategy to lead from your longest suit against a notrump contract. Here, however, the West hand contains 3 suits which are equally long. Spades, hearts, and clubs are all 4-card suits. At least we know that a diamond lead is out! |
pg| ***** 132 ***** |


ls|ws|ls|wh|

nt|^b@2^z@3A club lead is somewhat attractive because the club suit is headed by a nice sequence of cards. If all other things are equal, it is often best to lead from a suit in which the top 2 (or more) cards are touching. |
pg| ***** 133 ***** |


hs|whws|ls|wc|at|With this particular hand, however, all things are not equal. In particular, West's spades and hearts are both considerably stronger than West's clubs as both of those suits are headed by their respective Aces. |
pg| ***** 134 ***** |


hs|wc|

nt|^b@2^z@3|cs|2|at|The following principle can be used to resolve this problem:

^-{ When selecting an opening lead against notrump from 2 or more suits that contain 
 the same number of cards, it is usually best to lead the strongest of these suits. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 135 ***** |


ls|wc|

nt|^b@2^z@3As West's spades and hearts are clearly stronger than his clubs, let's forget about clubs and focus on the major suits. |
pg| ***** 136 ***** |


at|West's hearts and spades are very similar. Both suits contain 4 cards and both suits contain the Ace, the 8, and the 7. |
pg| ***** 137 ***** |


at|The only difference is that West's 4th spade is the @S6 while his 4th heart is the @H10. |
pg| ***** 138 ***** |


ls|ws|At|West's hearts are stronger than his spades. Therefore, hearts is the suit that he should select for his opening lead. |
pg| ***** 139 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Can the presence of the @H10 (versus the @S6) really make that much difference? After all, cards lower than the Jack do not count toward a hand's high card point total.

|
pg| ***** 140 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ High spot cards are relevant to the play of most bridge deals. Both the declarer and the 
 defenders must make use of their spot cards in order to get the most out of their hands. }
|
pg| ***** 141 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3You will soon see why the @H10 could be a very big card, but first, now that we know we are leading a heart, we have to decide which heart to lead. |
pg| ***** 142 ***** |


at|In our first example deal a spade opening lead was made from a holding of @S1098765. |
pg| ***** 143 ***** |


at|You were told that the table of standard leads recommends the lead of the @S10 (the highest card) from that holding. |
pg| ***** 144 ***** |


ls|wh|hc|ha|at|Does that mean that the @HA is the proper heart to lead from @HA1087?|
pg| ***** 145 ***** |


lc|ha|hc|h7|

nt|^b@2^z@3No. In fact the table of standard leads suggests that the @H7 (the lowest heart) is the correct heart to lead from @HA1087. |
pg| ***** 146 ***** |


at|Do you find it confusing that the standard lead from some holdings is the highest card and the standard lead from other holdings is the lowest card? |
pg| ***** 147 ***** |


at|It happens to be the case that a middle card is the standard lead from some holdings as well. |
pg| ***** 148 ***** |


at|Don't lose any sleep over this. It will all make sense soon. For now let's lead the @H7 and see what happens...|
pg| ***** 149 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|lc|h7|pc|h7|
at|You lead the @H7 and North's dummy should look familiar. Do you know why? |
pg| ***** 150 ***** |


hs|nd|at|Dummy's diamond suit is the same as it was on the first example deal in this chapter. |
pg| ***** 151 ***** |


at|If you noticed that, it means that you are already starting to develop the mind of a bridge player. Bridge makes for good brain exercise and you will find that the more that you play the game, the better your memory will get. Better still, you don't really have to try to improve your memory, it just happens!|
pg| ***** 152 ***** |


ls|nd|hs|nh|

nt|^b@2^z@3Declarer plays the @H2 from dummy, |

pc|hk|at|and the declarer wins the trick with the @HK. |
pg| ***** 155 ***** |


hs|wh|at|Are you concerned that you allowed declarer to win the first trick with the @HK? After all, if you had made the opening lead of the @HA (instead of the @H7) you would have won the first trick. |
pg| ***** 156 ***** |

pg| ***** 157 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|ls|wH|pc|dj|hs|wd|hs|nd|at|
Declarer attacks diamonds at trick 2 by leading the @DJ from his hand. You follow suit with your singleton @D5 and the @D7 is played from the dummy. |
pg| ***** 158 ***** |


ls|wd|ls|nd|pc|ddda|at|Your partner wins the trick with the @DA. |

pg| ***** 160 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|pc|h|hs|wh|at|If you guessed that your partner was going to return a heart, you are already getting the hang of being a defender! |
pg| ***** 161 ***** |


at|Remember that defense is all about teamwork. |
pg| ***** 162 ***** |


at|The fact that you selected a heart as your opening lead means that you thought hearts was the best suit for the defense to attack. |
pg| ***** 163 ***** |


at|Your partner's heart return suggests that he trusts your judgment - he is following through with your plan. Now that's teamwork!|
pg| ***** 164 ***** |


hs|wh|sk||hs|sh|

nt|^b@2^z@3Have a look at the remaining cards. Declarer has 2 hearts left, the @HJ and the @H9, but he has no winning option. His contract is going to fail regardless of which heart he plays now. |
pg| ***** 165 ***** |


at|Does the heart position look familiar at all? It should because, in a sense, the defenders are taking a finesse against South's @HJ. |
pg| ***** 166 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|cs|2|ht|c|at|^-{ Many bridge techniques (such as the finesse) are available to both the declarer 
 and the defenders. Your familiarity with declarer play will help you learn to defend! }
^-
|ht|p|at|Beside finesses, hold up plays, crossruffs, and the establishment of long suits are examples of techniques that can be used by the defenders as well as the declarer. |
pg| ***** 167 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
So let's see why the heart position is like a finesse for the defense. |
pg| ***** 168 ***** |


ls|wh|ls|sh|hc|h9|at|Suppose first that South plays the @H9. |
pg| ***** 169 ***** |


lc|h9|pc|h9|hc|ht|at|You will win the trick with the @H10 |
pg| ***** 170 ***** |


hs|nh|at|(furthermore, you will know that the @H10 will win the trick because you can see that dummy's only remaining heart is the @H3). |
pg| ***** 171 ***** |


ls|nh|lc|ht|pc|ht|pc|h3|
pg| ***** 172 ***** |


hs|wh|hs|sh|

nt|^b@2^z@3You can now lead your @HA and since the declarer's only remaining heart is the @HJ, he must play it on this trick. |
pg| ***** 173 ***** |


ls|wh|ls|sh|pc|hashh|
pg| ***** 174 ***** |


hc|h8|hc|sa|at|The defense has won 3 tricks so far and your hand contains 2 more certain winners, the @SA and the @H8. |
pg| ***** 175 ***** |


at|The @SA was always a winner, of course, but the @H8 was established as a winner thanks to your opening lead and both you and your partner's subsequent strong defense. |
pg| ***** 176 ***** |


mc|10|at|The 3NT contract will fail by 1 trick.|
pg| ***** 177 ***** |


lc|h8|lc|sa|up|7|hc|hj|

nt|^b@2^z@3Now suppose that the declarer plays the @HJ instead of the @H9 on the second round of that suit. |
pg| ***** 178 ***** |


lc|hj|pc|hj|hc|ha|at|You would then win the @HA. |
pg| ***** 179 ***** |


lc|ha|pc|hah|
pg| ***** 180 ***** |


hc|ht|hs|sh|at|Next you lead the @H10 and the declarer's last heart, the @H9, falls under it. |
pg| ***** 181 ***** |


lc|ht|ls|sh|pc|htshh|
pg| ***** 182 ***** |


hc|h8sa|mc|8|at|As before, the defense will have won 3 tricks and the @SA and @H8 will represent tricks 4 and 5 for the defenders. 3NT will fail by 1 trick. |
pg| ***** 183 ***** |


lc|h8sa|up|7|hs|sh|hs|wh|

nt|^b@2^z@3So it doesn't matter if declarer plays the @HJ or the @H9 when your partner returns the suit that you selected for your opening lead. In either case, you will win the trick as cheaply as possible and the defense will come to 5 tricks (3 hearts, the @SA, and the @DA that your partner has already won). |

nt|^b@2^z@3Later in this program we will explore various techniques for winning tricks that can be used by the defenders, but the current lesson is about opening leads against notrump contracts. |
pg| ***** 191 ***** |


hs|wh|at|You will recall that hearts was the recommended suit for the opening lead on this deal. |
pg| ***** 192 ***** |


hs|ws|at|West's hearts and spades are very similar, but the presence of the @H10 tipped the balance in favor of a heart lead. |
pg| ***** 193 ***** |


ls|wh|at|Let's see how a spade opening lead would have fared on this deal. |
pg| ***** 194 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|ls|ws|pc|s|hs|es|hs|ss|at|
After a spade opening lead, your partner plays the @SQ and declarer wins the @SK. |

hs|es|at|and your partner returns a spade, the suit that you selected for your opening lead. |
pg| ***** 199 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|ls|es|pc|s|hs|ss|at|It doesn't matter if declarer plays the @SJ or the @S9 here, but let's assume he plays the @S9. |
pg| ***** 200 ***** |

nt|^b@2^z@3The spade suit |
pg| ***** 208 ***** |


ls|nsssesws|hs|nhshehwh|at|and the heart suit are almost the same around the table on this example deal, |
pg| ***** 209 ***** |


ls|nhshehwh|hc|stht|at|but the fact that West was dealt the @H10 while North was dealt the @S10 makes hearts 2 tricks more effective than spades as an opening lead. |

nt|^b@2^z@3You may be getting sick of hearing this already, but you are going to keep hearing it: 

|cs|1|at|^-{ Opening leads come with no guarantees. On a slightly different deal, a spade opening lead 
 would be more effective than a heart opening lead, but the odds favor leading a heart. }
^-|
pg| ***** 213 ***** |


ls|ws|ls|wh|

nt|^b@2^z@3A lot of people are afraid of serious math and, if you are one of these people, the mention of a word like "odds" might frighten you. |
pg| ***** 214 ***** |


at|Really, there is no need for concern. The math in this program does not get any more complex than counting up to 13. |
pg| ***** 215 ***** |


hs|wh|at|When we say that "the odds favor a heart lead", all that this means is that there are more possible deals in which a heart lead will defeat the contract |
pg| ***** 216 ***** |


ls|wh|hs|Ws|at|than deals in which a spade lead will defeat the contract. |
pg| ***** 217 ***** |


ls|ws|hc|Ht|at|The @H10 is the reason. |
pg| ***** 218 ***** |


lc|ht|hs|whwswc|

nt|^b@2^z@3|ht|b|at|We now have a solid rule for deciding on a suit for the opening lead against a notrump contract:

|
pg| ***** 219 ***** |


hc|h7|ls|whwswc|

nt|^b@2^z@3Before we go on to another example deal, there is a further instructional point contained in this deal that is worth mentioning. Recall that you were told that the lowest card (the @H7 in this case) is the standard lead from a holding like @HA1087. |
pg| ***** 220 ***** |


lc|h7|hc|ha|at|Let's see what happens if West chooses to lead his highest heart (the @HA) instead of the @H7 that the table of standard leads suggests. |
pg| ***** 221 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|lc|ha|pc|ha|hs|nh|hs|eh|hs|sh|at|Given that the @HA is bound to win the first trick, the other 3 hands might as well follow suit with their lowest hearts so as to not waste any high cards. |

hs|wh|at|Suppose that West plays a second round of hearts now. |

at|Diamonds is not only your longest suit, but it also happens to be the only suit in which you have any real high card strength. |
pg| ***** 241 ***** |


at|Length is more important than strength as far as opening leads are concerned, but on this hand diamonds is both your longest and your strongest suit. Diamonds seems like the obvious choice.|

nt|^b@2^z@3Indeed, diamonds would be the obvious choice except for one thing. |
pg| ***** 243 ***** |


ls|wd|hs|ws|at|Your partner has overcalled in spades. There are a few times when you should not lead your longest and strongest suit against a notrump contract. Here is one of them:

pg| ***** 245 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Even though spades is your weakest suit, it is the suit you should lead on this deal. |
pg| ***** 246 ***** |


at|The reason is that your partner's 1@S overcall suggests that he has a strong 5-card (or longer) spade suit. |
pg| ***** 247 ***** |


at|The 1@S overcall also suggests a reasonable hand in terms of high cards. Even though South's 1NT bid shows at least 1 spade stopper, your partner rates to have some high cards outside of spades. There is a good chance that your partner will be able to gain the lead later in the play.|
pg| ***** 248 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3So let's try a spade for our opening lead and see how this might result in the defeat of South's 3NT contract. |

pg| ***** 264 ***** |


ls|wd|hc|d2dk|at|The table of standard leads will tell us that, with West's diamond holding, neither the highest card (the @DK) nor the lowest card (the @D2) is the best diamond to lead. |

nt|^b@2^z@3|va|5|at|In the last example deal we learned that selecting an opening lead from a suit that your partner bid is a good idea. Assuming that your partner has bid a suit and you become the opening leader, is it correct to say that one should ^*Ialways^*N lead the suit that partner bid?

pg| ***** 282 ***** |


at|If they did then some of the really challenging aspects of bridge (like selecting an opening lead) would not be that difficult. If the word ^*Ialways^*N applied to opening leads, we could establish a set of "rules" for selecting an opening lead against notrump like:

|
pg| ***** 283 ***** |


cs|3|at|^-{ Rule 1: If your partner has bid a suit, ^*Ialways^*N lead that suit! }

^-
|
pg| ***** 286 ***** |


at|If you follow the "rules" above, you will find yourself making relatively effective opening leads. You will make even better opening leads, however, if you replace the ^*Ialways^*N in each of the above "rules" with ^*Iusually^*N. Furthermore, try to think of these statements as "guidelines", not "rules".

pg| ***** 287 ***** |


cs|1|at|^-{ Bridge is really a game of judgment, not rules; this is a good thing because the 
 game would be boring if rules dictated the right card to play in every situation! }

nt|^b@2^z@3If you thought that a heart opening lead was correct, there is good news and bad news. |

nt|^b@2^z@3Consider the likely effect of a diamond opening lead. |
pg| ***** 297 ***** |


at|Your diamond suit is solid except that the @DA is missing. |
pg| ***** 298 ***** |


at|The declarer almost certainly has that card (since he has shown a very strong hand by overcalling 3NT). |
pg| ***** 299 ***** |


at|Nonetheless, by leading diamonds you will be able to drive out the @DA and promote your remaining cards in that suit into winners. |

pg| ***** 303 ***** |


lc|ca|ls|wd|hc|dk|

nt|^b@2^z@3OK - let's put the plan into action! All of West's diamonds are equals, but the table of standard leads suggests that the @DK is the correct card to lead from a holding like @DKQJT9. |

nt|^b@2^z@3Well somebody has to have the @DA and it certainly isn't you or the dummy. Perhaps your partner was dealt that card, but it is more likely that the declarer has ducked the @DA as a hold up play. |

hs|wheh|at|Give yourself a pat on the back for selecting an opening lead from your own strong diamond suit instead of from hearts, the suit that your partner had bid!|
pg| ***** 318 ***** |


ls|wh|ls|eh|hs|wd|up|24|

nt|^b@2^z@3Let's go back to the start of the play and see why you really deserve that pat on the back for your diamond opening lead. |
pg| ***** 319 ***** |


ls|wd|hs|ehwh|at|We have already learned that leading your partner's bid suit is usually a smart move against a notrump contract. |
pg| ***** 320 ***** |


at|Despite the fact that East has the long and powerful heart suit that he advertised with his 3@H preempt, a heart opening lead would not have worked very well on this deal. |
pg| ***** 321 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|ls|wh|ls|eh|pc|h|hs|eh|at|After a heart opening lead, East would play an honor card |
pg| ***** 322 ***** |


ls|eh|pc|hhj|hs|sh|at|and the declarer would win the @HA. |
pg| ***** 323 ***** |


ls|sh|pc|ha|at|There are 2 reasons why it would be a mistake for the declarer to hold up his @HA here. |
pg| ***** 324 ***** |


hs|ed|at|First, if declarer had ducked the @HA, he would have given East a chance to switch to diamonds and we have already seen that diamonds are a problem for declarer on this deal. |
pg| ***** 325 ***** |


ls|ed|hs|eh|

nt|^b@2^z@3The second reason why it would have been wrong for the declarer to hold up his @HA is that the declarer should know that you are now void in hearts. |
pg| ***** 326 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sh|at|East's 3@H preempt suggested a 7-card heart suit and declarer began with 5 hearts between his hand and the dummy. |
pg| ***** 327 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|nh|ls|sh|at|There are only 13 hearts in the deck and the declarer knows that the 1 heart you were dealt was played on the opening lead. Therefore, holding up the @HA would serve no purpose.|
pg| ***** 328 ***** |


hs|wc|hs|sc|

nt|^b@2^z@3After winning the @HA, the declarer will attack clubs as before, leading the @CK to drive out your @CA. |
pg| ***** 329 ***** |


ls|sc|ls|Wc|pc|ckcacc|
pg| ***** 330 ***** |


hs|eh|at|Your partner's hearts have been established as winners, but there is no entry to the East hand. There is no way for your partner to regain the lead so that he can run his long suit. |
pg| ***** 331 ***** |


at|Rats! All those good hearts are going to go to waste!|
pg| ***** 332 ***** |


ls|eh|hs|wd|

nt|^b@2^z@3To make matters worse for the defense, it is too late for a diamond attack to be effective. |
pg| ***** 333 ***** |

pg| ***** 334 ***** |


ls|sd|pc|ddda|

hs|ns|hs|ss|hs|nc|at|and win the next 8 tricks (3 spades and 5 clubs). |
pg| ***** 336 ***** |


mc|10|at|Given that the declarer has already won 2 tricks he will claim his contract with 1 overtrick - not exactly a victory for leading the suit that your partner bid!|
pg| ***** 337 ***** |


ls|nsssnc|up|12|hs|wd|

nt|^b@2^z@3
To summarize, an opening lead in diamonds resulted in 3NT failing by 1 trick, |
pg| ***** 338 ***** |


ls|wd|hs|ehwh|at|but an opening lead in hearts (the suit that East bid) allowed the declarer to make 3NT with 1 overtrick. |

nt|^b@2^z@3On this particular deal, West can be nearly certain that a diamond opening lead will result in the defense winning at least 5 tricks (the @CA and 4 diamond tricks). |
pg| ***** 346 ***** |

nt|^b@2^z@3
This chapter is about defense, but this is an excellent opportunity to mention an important lesson in bidding. West knows that 3NT is very likely to fail after a diamond opening lead. Does this mean that West should double South's 3NT overcall? |
pg| ***** 356 ***** |


ls|wd|ha||mb|d|

nt|^b@2^z@3The advantage of doubling 3NT is that East-West will score a larger penalty in the likely event that 3NT fails. |
pg| ***** 357 ***** |


hs|nc|ha||mb|4c|at|The disadvantage to doubling 3NT is that one of the defenders might run to another contract. Here, for example, North may reason that your double suggests that 3NT is not going to be a success. He might try his luck in 4@C. |

hs|wd|ha||mb|pp?|

nt|^b@2^z@3You have no particular reason to think that you can defeat a 4@C contract. You are certainly not going to win 4 diamond tricks if clubs are trump since the opponents will eventually be able to ruff your diamond leads. |

ls|wd|hs|sc|hs|wc|at|In fact, 4@C would succeed on this deal. The defense would win only 3 tricks (the @CA, |

nt|^b@2^z@3Really this is another example of a judgment call, but if your judgment is good you will realize that you should be happy that the opponents are in 3NT. Don't double and tip them off to the fact that they might have made a mistake! |

nt|^b@2^z@3This example deal illustrates another way in which listening to the bidding can help guide the opening leader in his decision. |

hs|ws|

nt|^b@2^z@3Based on what you have learned so far, spades would be the suit of choice for the opening lead. |

at|Your partner has not bid any suits so you would normally look no further than your own longest and strongest suit and that is clearly spades. |

at|Between your 5 spades, North's 4 (or more) spades, and South's 2 or 3 spades, you know that your partner has 2 spades at the very most. |
pg| ***** 393 ***** |


at|Time to look elsewhere for the partnership's best combined suit. |
pg| ***** 394 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3The bidding tells you that your partner has 2 spades at the very most. |
pg| ***** 395 ***** |


ls|ws|hs|wh|at|It also tells you something about your partner's heart holding. |
pg| ***** 396 ***** |


at|South should have exactly 5 hearts given that he opened the bidding with 1@H and rebid 1NT (as opposed to 2@H which he would bid if he held 6 or more hearts). |
pg| ***** 397 ***** |


at|Meanwhile, North opted to play in 3NT instead of 4@H. He has 2 hearts at the most. |
pg| ***** 398 ***** |


at|It is very likely that your partner has at least 4 cards in hearts. |
pg| ***** 399 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Given that your partner is known to be long in hearts, is it a good idea to lead that suit? |
pg| ***** 400 ***** |


at|No! The declarer is also known to be long in hearts and the chances are that he is strong in hearts as well (because the more cards you have in a suit, the more likely you are to hold some of the high cards in that suit). |
pg| ***** 401 ***** |


hs|ws|

nt|^b@2^z@3Hopefully the math that was presented on the last few pages was not too overwhelming - it involved little more than adding up some numbers and then subtracting the total from 13. |
pg| ***** 402 ***** |


at|There are many situations like this where you can combine various inferences from the bidding and draw conclusions about the unseen hands. |
pg| ***** 403 ***** |


at|Isn't it cool that your own hand and the bidding can tell you so much about the number of cards your partner rates to hold in both major suits?|
pg| ***** 404 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Whether you think it is cool or not, the main lesson from this deal is a new guideline that can be used for selecting an opening lead against a notrump contract:

|
pg| ***** 405 ***** |


ht|n|cs|2|at|^-{ Against notrump contracts, it is usually a bad idea to lead a suit that an opponent has bid. 
 Unless your partner has bid a suit, make your opening lead from one of the unbid suits. }
|
pg| ***** 406 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3On this deal your partner has not bid a suit. The opponents have bid both spades and hearts. Choosing an opening lead from a suit bid by your opponents does not work out well on most notrump deals. |
pg| ***** 407 ***** |


ls|wswh|hs|wcwd|at|There are 2 unbid suits on this deal, diamonds and clubs, and you should select your opening lead from one of these 2 suits.|
pg| ***** 408 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|ht|b|at|Which of the unbid suits is it going to be? Diamonds or clubs? 

|
pg| ***** 409 ***** |


cs|4|at|^-{ When faced with a choice of unbid suits to lead against a notrump contract, 
 it is usually best to lead whichever unbid suit is your longest and strongest. }
|
pg| ***** 410 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3
Here you have equal length in the unbid suits as your hand contains 3 cards in both diamonds and clubs. |
pg| ***** 411 ***** |


ls|wd|at|However, the presence of the @CQ makes your club suit clearly stronger than your diamond suit. |
pg| ***** 412 ***** |


at|Clubs is the suit you should select for your opening lead. |
pg| ***** 413 ***** |


ls|wc|hs|ws|

nt|^b@2^z@3You have seen sound reasons for avoiding leading your own longest and strongest suit against notrump when that suit has been bid by the opponents. |
pg| ***** 414 ***** |


hs|wc|ls|ws|at|When this is the case you should lead the unbid suit in which you have the longest and strongest holding (clubs in this example deal). There is a good reason for this guideline as well. |
pg| ***** 415 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|hs|wd|cs|1|ht|d|at|^-{ When the opponents have bid your long suit, the main chance of defeating a notrump 
 contract is to hope that you can hit your partner's long suit with your opening lead. }
^-
|
pg| ***** 416 ***** |


ht|p|ls|wc|at|Here, if your partner's long suit is diamonds, you don't have much help for him. |
pg| ***** 417 ***** |


ls|wd|hs|wc|at|If your partner's best suit is clubs, however, your @CQ may help to establish tricks in that suit. |

nt|^b@2^z@3Let's have a look at the entire deal and see how well a club opening lead might work for the defense. |
pg| ***** 419 ***** |


ls|wc|hs|shnswhwseseh|at|First note that the your partner does indeed have the expected spade shortness and heart length that you were able to infer from the opponents' bidding and your holdings in those suits. |
pg| ***** 420 ***** |


ls|shnswhwseseh|hs|ecwc|at|Notice also that clubs happens to be your partner's longest suit. |
pg| ***** 421 ***** |


at|Although finding partner with a long club suit is not the result of an inference, it is a piece of good luck that you deserve!|
pg| ***** 422 ***** |


hc|c2|ls|wcec|

nt|^b@2^z@3The table of standard leads against a notrump contract suggests the lead of the smallest card from a holding like @CQ52. |
pg| ***** 423 ***** |


lc|c2|pc|c2|

hs|nc|hs|sc|at|Let's think about this hand from the declarer's point of view. He might as well play the @CJ from the dummy as that card is either going to win a trick now (if your opening lead was from a club suit that included both the @CK and @CQ) or never. |
pg| ***** 424 ***** |


ls|ncsc|pc|cj|hs|ec|at|Your partner certainly does not want the @CJ to win a trick so he will cover it with the @CK. |
pg| ***** 425 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3|ls|ec|pc|ck|hs|sc|at|As we will see, it is correct for the declarer to hold up his @CA. |
pg| ***** 426 ***** |


ls|sc|pc|c|
pg| ***** 427 ***** |


hs|ec|at|Your partner knows that the defense is on to a good thing. He will return a club. Which club your partner should return is an issue we will deal with later. Assume for now that he leads back the @C10. |
pg| ***** 428 ***** |


ls|ec|pc|ct|hs|sc|at|Declarer should hold up his @CA again. |
pg| ***** 429 ***** |


ls|sc|pc|c|hs|wc|at|You have no reason to overtake your partner's winning @C10 with your @CQ so the @C10 will win the second trick. |
pg| ***** 430 ***** |


ls|wc|pc|cc|
pg| ***** 431 ***** |


hs|ec|hs|sc|

nt|^b@2^z@3East plays back a 3rd round of clubs and this time the declarer must win his @CA. |
pg| ***** 432 ***** |


ls|ecwc|pc|c9ccs|
pg| ***** 433 ***** |


hs|ssns|at|South just won his first trick. He has 2 winners in spades |

ls|ndsd|hs|nhsheh|at|That's 7 winners in total, but declarer can establish 4 extra winners in hearts by driving out the @HA. |
pg| ***** 436 ***** |


ls|nhsheh|pc|hhhk|

hs|eh|at|The problem for declarer is that your partner was dealt the @HA |

mc|8|hs|sh|hs|nd|hc|sask|

nt|^b@2^z@3There are only 7 tricks remaining and the declarer has about 10 winners left for those tricks. He will have no problem claiming the last 7 tricks, but the defenders have won 5 tricks already. 3NT has failed by 1 trick. |

nt|^b@2^z@3Indeed, the declarer put out a really good effort with his hold up play in clubs. Let's take a slight diversion from our study of defense and return to the start of the play of this deal to admire the declarer's technique. The hold up play did not work here, but it would have worked if the actual deal had been a little bit different. |
pg| ***** 445 ***** |


ls|sc|hc|c2|

nt|^b@2^z@3Your opening lead was the @C2 (since clubs was your best unbid suit). |
pg| ***** 446 ***** |


lc|c2|pc|c2|hs|ncecsc|at|The @CJ was played from the dummy and your partner's @CK was ducked by the declarer. |

hs|ec|hs|sc|at|Your partner returned the @C10 and the declarer correctly made a 2nd hold up play in clubs. |
pg| ***** 449 ***** |


ls|Ecsc|pc|ctccc|
pg| ***** 450 ***** |


hs|ecscwc|at|East continued with a 3rd round of clubs and the declarer now had to take his @CA. Your supply of clubs was exhausted on this trick and that is what the hold up play is all about! |
pg| ***** 451 ***** |


ls|ecscwc|pc|c9ccs|
pg| ***** 452 ***** |


hs|nhshehec|

nt|^b@2^z@3On this deal the hold up play in clubs did not help declarer because your partner had the @HA along with 2 winning clubs to cash. |
pg| ***** 453 ***** |


md|0,ha,,h3|ls|ecshnh|hs|wh|at|Imagine that you had been dealt the @HA instead of your partner. |

pg| ***** 455 ***** |


ls|nhshwh|pc|hhahh|
pg| ***** 456 ***** |


hs|ec|at|and, thanks to declarer's hold up play in clubs, your partner's 2 club winners would be stranded. |
pg| ***** 457 ***** |


ls|ec|hs|nhshndsd|hc|sask|mc|10|at|Declarer would win the rest of the tricks and make 3NT with an overtrick. |
pg| ***** 458 ***** |


hs|ehwh|ls|nhshndsd|lc|sask|up|16|md|0,h3,,ha|

nt|^b@2^z@3Now let's put the @HA back in your partner's hand and slightly change this deal in a different way. |
pg| ***** 459 ***** |


ls|ehwh|hs|wcwd|at|Recall that you selected a club as your opening lead, because the only unbid suits were diamonds and clubs and because your clubs were stronger than your diamonds. |
pg| ***** 460 ***** |


hs|sdscwdwc|md|0cqd7,dqc6|at|Let's change that. You have now been given South's @DQ and, in exchange, he has been given your @CQ. That may sound like a fair trade, but on the actual deal you have been ripped off!|
pg| ***** 461 ***** |


ls|scsd|

nt|^b@2^z@3Now that you have the @DQ instead of the @CQ, diamonds has become your best unbid suit. |
pg| ***** 462 ***** |


ls|wc|at|You should now select a diamond as your opening lead. As before, the table of standard leads suggests leading the smallest card from a holding like @DQ94. |
pg| ***** 463 ***** |


ls|wd|pc|d4|at|Leading your best unbid suit will not work out very well now. In fact, the declarer can win 12 tricks after a diamond opening lead! |
pg| ***** 464 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|wd|

nt|^b@2^z@3If declarer plays the @D8 from the dummy (finessing for the @DQ in your hand), he will win the trick with that card. |
pg| ***** 465 ***** |


ls|ndwd|pc|ddd|
pg| ***** 466 ***** |


hs|nhsheh|at|Declarer will drive out the @HA and, when your partner wins a trick with that card, it will be the only trick for the defense! |
pg| ***** 467 ***** |


ls|nhsheh|pc|hkhahh|
pg| ***** 468 ***** |


hs|ec|at|There is nothing that the defense can do to win another trick. Your partner may try switching to a club, his best suit, |
pg| ***** 469 ***** |


ls|ec|pc|ct|hs|scnc|at|but South can finesse him for the @CK. Declarer will play the @C8 from his hand and win the trick with dummy's @CJ. |
pg| ***** 470 ***** |


ls|scnc|pc|cccj|
pg| ***** 471 ***** |


hc|sask|

nt|^b@2^z@3There are 10 tricks left and declarer has 9 easy winners (the @SA and @SK, |

nt|^b@2^z@3Leading your strongest unbid suit did not work very well here. Does that mean that it was a mistake to select a diamond as your opening lead? |

pg| ***** 479 ***** |


at|Opening leads come with no guarantees. |
pg| ***** 480 ***** |


at|Diamonds is the correct suit to lead with the West hand, but that doesn't mean that an opening lead from that suit will always defeat the contract. |
pg| ***** 481 ***** |


hs|ed|

nt|^b@2^z@3By leading a diamond here, we were hoping to find our partner's best suit. It turns out that East was dealt a rather pathetic diamond holding, but if his diamonds had been longer and stronger, our @DQ would have helped to establish tricks for the defense in that suit. |
pg| ***** 482 ***** |


at|We were unlucky that partner's diamond suit was so poor, but that doesn't make our opening lead wrong - it just didn't work on this particular deal. |
pg| ***** 483 ***** |


ls|edwd|Hs|ecwc|

nt|^b@2^z@3Now suppose that we somehow knew that clubs was in fact partner's best suit. Would a club opening lead (our weaker of the 2 unbid suits) have worked any better? |
pg| ***** 484 ***** |


hs|sc|at|No. We won't go through all of the motions here, but the bottom line is that the declarer can win 12 tricks, even after a club opening lead. The presence of the @CQ in the South hand makes a big difference. |
pg| ***** 485 ***** |


ls|ecsc|hs|wd|

nt|^b@2^z@3|cs|4|ht|d|at|^-{ On some deals it doesn't matter what the opening lead is or how well the

ht|q|at|The deal you see above is such a deal. Declarer can win 12 tricks no matter what is led and how the defenders play. On this deal the declarer is destined to succeed in 3NT. |
pg| ***** 487 ***** |


hs|ec|

nt|^b@2^z@3The main lesson of this example deal is that if you are going to try to find your partner's best suit with your opening lead against a notrump contract, you might as well lead your own best unbid suit. |

pg| ***** 490 ***** |

^-{ Example Deal 6 - Leads against 6NT or 7NT }

|cp||at|So far in our study of opening leads against notrump, the contract has always been 3NT. That is fitting because you will find yourself as the opening leader more often against 3NT than against any other notrump contract. |
pg| ***** 499 ***** |


at|When leading against 3NT the opening leader tries to lead his partnership's best suit in the hope that it will be possible to establish 5 winners for the defense and thereby defeat the contract. |
pg| ***** 500 ***** |


at|

The opening leader's basic strategy should be similar against the relatively common contracts of 1NT and 2NT - try to find an opening lead that will establish extra winners for the defense. |
pg| ***** 501 ***** |


at|Of course, the defense needs to win more tricks to defeat these contracts than they need to defeat 3NT, but when the opponents stop below 3NT, the defenders usually have more assets to work with.|
pg| ***** 502 ***** |


at|

You won't find yourself on opening lead against 4NT or 5NT contracts very often. Good bidders try to avoid these contracts as they offer no extra bonus points (but require more tricks) than the game contract of 3NT. |
pg| ***** 503 ***** |


at|Still, when you are on lead against 4NT or 5NT, it is usually correct to follow the guidelines that have been presented in this chapter for selecting an opening lead against a notrump contract.

nt|^b@2^z@3In this example deal, South was the dealer and opened 1NT. North raised all the way to 7NT. What are your thoughts as to the proper opening lead from the West hand? |
pg| ***** 507 ***** |


ls|wswhwc|ub|4|ha||mb|3n|an| |ha||mb|ppp|at|If North had bid 3NT instead of 7NT, the guidelines that we have learned so far would suggest a diamond opening lead from the West hand (because East did not bid a suit, because diamonds is an unbid suit, and because West's longest and strongest suit is diamonds). |

ub|4|ha||mb|7n|an| |ha||mb|ppp|hs|wcwswh|ls|wd|

nt|^b@2^z@3When North raises all the way to 7NT, however, diamonds becomes the worst suit to lead from. Any of the other 3 suits would make a better opening lead than a diamond. |
pg| ***** 509 ***** |


ls|wswhwc|hs|wd|at|The reason is that a diamond opening lead would be best characterized as aggressive and it is usually best to lead passively against notrump slams, especially grand slams! |
pg| ***** 510 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3Another way to think about this opening lead problem is that the opponents' bidding makes it very likely that the @DK is just about the only high card that the defense was dealt. |
pg| ***** 511 ***** |


at|As such, the best chance to defeat this grand slam is to hope that the @DK will win a trick eventually. |
pg| ***** 512 ***** |


at|Leading a diamond is much more likely to help the declarer than it is to help the defense. |
pg| ***** 513 ***** |


at|It is best to leave the diamond suit alone and let the declarer play that suit himself. |
pg| ***** 514 ***** |


ls|wd|hc|d2|

nt|^b@2^z@3If you choose to disregard this advice, the table of standard leads suggests that the @D2 is the correct card to lead from a holding like @DK972. Let's see what might happen if you made this lead. |
pg| ***** 515 ***** |


lc|d2|pc|d|at|Now that's a dummy! |
pg| ***** 516 ***** |


hc|sqkhaqjdjcqka|at|North has 22 high card points (HCP) which is about what you would expect for his jump to 7NT over his partner's 1NT opening bid (which promised 15-17 HCP). |
pg| ***** 517 ***** |


hc|dk|

nt|^b@2^z@3Let's do some quick arithmetic. Dummy has 22 HCP and you have 3 HCP. There are 40 HCP in the deck so the declarer, who promised 15-17 HCP when he opened 1NT, must have the remaining 15 HCP. |
pg| ***** 518 ***** |


at|You now know that your poor partner does not have any HCP at all! |
pg| ***** 519 ***** |


sk||lc|dkskqhaqjcakqdj|hc|daq|at|You also know that your diamond opening lead is not going to work very well because the declarer must have both the @DA and the @DQ. |
pg| ***** 520 ***** |


ls|sd|hs|wd|

nt|^b@2^z@3In fact, a diamond opening lead is a disaster on this deal as this lead allows declarer to make a contract that would have failed after an opening lead in any other suit! |

|cp||at|You have learned a lot about defense in general and opening leads against notrump contracts in particular in the 6 example deals that were just presented. Now it is time to review the guidelines that we have established for deciding which suit to lead against a notrump contract. After this review a series of quizzes will follow where you can test your knowledge of the material that you have seen.

This table will help guide you as to which card to select as your opening lead from just about any holding you could ever have in a suit. However, before you learn which card to lead, you have to learn which suit to lead! Hopefully the review and exercises that follow will help to solidify your knowledge in this area.

suits. Leading a suit that the opponents have bid is usually not good for the defense! }

cs|4|at|{ Guideline 3: In choosing among the unbid suits for your opening lead, it is usually best to 
 select the suit in which you were dealt the most cards (that is, your longest unbid suit). }

|
pg| ***** 557 ***** |


cs|2|at|{ Guideline 4: If you were dealt equal length in 2 or more of the unbid suits, it is usually best
  to select for your opening lead the suit in which you were dealt the strongest holding. }

|
pg| ***** 558 ***** |


cs|3|at|{ Guideline 5: When defending against notrump slams it is usually best to avoid 
 aggressive opening leads. Against 6NT or 7NT try to find the most passive opening lead. }

ls|sc|hs|sd|at|Diamonds is clearly your best suit here and neither of the opponents has bid diamonds. Furthermore, your partner has not bid any suits of his own. Can you see any reason why diamonds is not the recommended suit for your opening lead?

|
pg| ***** 588 ***** |


ls|sd|Hs|sc|at|Your partner may not have bid any suits, but he did more than just pass at every opportunity. In particular, your partner doubled North's 2@C Stayman bid. In the original Learn to Play Bridge program, you learned about 2 kinds of doubles in bridge: takeout doubles and penalty doubles. East's double of 2@C here doesn't exactly fall into either of these categories.

There is not much point in East doubling North's 2@C for penalties since East knows that 2@C is not going to be the final contract. Stayman 2@C is an artificial bid asking the 1NT opener if he has a 4-card major suit. South will always bid either 2@D, 2@H, or 2@S in response to 2@C.

|cs|2|at|^-{ The double of an artificial bid is known as a lead-directing double. The purpose of such 
 a double is to suggest a good opening lead. It is best to follow your partner's suggestion! }

We have already learned that when your partner has bid a suit, it is usually smart to select that suit as your opening lead against a notrump contract. We have now seen that there is another way that your partner can suggest an opening lead - by doubling a suit bid by the opponents. 

Most doubles in bridge are either for takeout (that is, a request for partner to bid) or penalty (that is, a request for partner to pass). The double of an artificial bid, however, is an entirely different animal - it is a request for partner to select a particular suit for his opening lead. |

lc|sa|hc|dq|at|and there is a reasonable chance that the @DQ will also win a trick for the defense.

Your best chance to win a trick with your @DQ, however, is to let the opponents play that suit themselves. You are more likely to help the declarer than the defense if you select a diamond as your opening lead. The reason is that the bidding has strongly suggested that your partner has very little in the way of high cards. It is quite likely that the opponents were dealt the @DA, @DK, and @DJ between them. If this is the case then leading a diamond might give the declarer a trick that he could not win on his own.

|
pg| ***** 596 ***** |


lc|dq|hs|ss|at|Leading from a suit in which you hold the Ace (such as spades here) is not passive at all. Spades is another suit that you would like the declarer to have to play for himself. |

^-{ Standard leads against notrump contracts }
^-
|cp||at|We have spent a lot of time discussing how to decide which suit to select as your opening lead against a notrump contract. Once you have decided which suit to lead, you have to decide which card to lead from that suit.

It has been mentioned several times that there exists a table of standard opening leads that can be used to help guide you as to which card to lead from a given suit against notrump. Unlike deciding which suit to lead, deciding which card to lead is very rarely a matter of judgment - you should almost always adhere to the guidelines presented here for deciding which card to lead from a given suit.

The reason why it is correct to always lead the same card from a given holding in a suit is because this practice will make it easier for your partner to defend accurately. Remember, your partner cannot see your hand when he is defending, but you can help him to visualize which cards you were dealt with the card that you select for your opening lead.

pg| ***** 600 ***** |


hc|sq|cs|3|at|^B{|ih|psqjt9|at|}
|ht|t|at|^F  @2For example, if you and your partner always leads the @SQ from a holding like this one (which, as you will see, is considered the standard opening lead from this holding), your partner will learn something about your spade holding as soon as your @SQ hits the table. If instead you varied the card that you led from a holding like @SQJ109, it would be much harder for your partner to figure out the best defense.
|
pg| ***** 601 ***** |

nt|^b@2^z@3
The easiest standard opening leads to learn are those from suits that are headed by 3 (or more) touching high cards. If you are fortunate enough to be the opening leader against a notrump contract with a suit headed by 3 touching cards, you should lead the highest card in that suit.

|
pg| ***** 602 ***** |


ls|sh|hc|skhqcjdt|at|For example, the top card is led from each of the following holdings:

cs|2|at|^-{ Always lead the highest card from a suit headed by 3 or more touching high cards }
^-
|
pg| ***** 604 ***** |


at|Think about how helpful it can be to your partner if you always follow this guideline. For example, if you lead the @CJ against a notrump contract, your partner will know that there is a good chance that you are leading from a suit headed by the @CJ109. He won't know this for certain because, as we will see, there are other holding for which the Jack is the standard opening lead.

One thing your partner will know for sure, however, is that when you lead the @CJ, you will not have the @CQ (because if your club suit contained a 3-card sequence headed by the @CQJ10 you would have led the @CQ, not the @CJ). In the next chapter we will see how this sort of inference can help you and your partner to choose the most effective cards to play when defending.|
pg| ***** 605 ***** |

nt|^b@2^z@3|va|5|at|The following holdings are examples of what are known as interior sequences. These are characterized by suits headed by an Ace, King, or Queen, followed by a gap. Below the gap must be a sequence of 2 or more cards headed by an honor card (that is, a card at least as high as the 10):

|
pg| ***** 607 ***** |


at|In other words, lead the card just below the gap. For example, in the leftmost holding (the @SAQJ10), the @SK is missing and the result is a gap in the suit. The @SQ is the proper lead because it is the second highest card in the holding (which happens to be the card that falls just below the gap).

Notice that the second and third examples above illustrate a point that was made when we were examining leads from holdings headed by a sequence of 3 (or more) touching cards. The Jack is the standard opening lead from both of these holdings, but it is also the standard opening lead from a holding headed by the J109. The point here is that your partner will not always know exactly what holding you have led from after the opening lead of a Jack. The good news is that he will know a lot of holdings that you cannot have when the Jack (or any other honor card) is led.|
pg| ***** 608 ***** |


lc|sqhjcjdt|hc|sq|

nt|^b@2^z@3|va|5|at|It would be great if every opening lead that you ever made told your partner exactly what you were dealt in the suit that was led. Unfortunately that it is not possible - there are only 13 cards in each suit and there are a lot more than 13 possible holdings that you might want to lead from against notrump.

As such, when your partner sees your opening lead, usually there will be some ambiguity as to the exact holding that you have led from. For example, we have seen that the @SQ is the standard opening lead from both a 3-card sequence like @SQJ10 and an interior sequence like @SAQJ10. Your partner will know that you have the @SJ when you lead the @SQ, but how can he know whether you have the @SA or not?

^G{ |ih|psqjt|at| } ^Q{ |ih|psaqjt|at| }

The answer is that sometimes your partner will not know. Fortunately, sometimes the @SA will be in the dummy and sometimes your partner will be dealt the @SA himself. Furthermore, sometimes your partner will be able to infer the position of the @SA either from the bidding or from the way that the declarer plays the hand.

nt|^b@2^z@3|Va|5|At|So far we have seen that the standard opening lead against a notrump contract can be the highest card held in a suit (when the suit is headed by a sequence of 3 or more touching cards). We have also seen that the second highest card in a suit is sometimes the standard opening lead (in the case of an interior sequence). 

Leading from either a 3-card sequence or an interior sequence is a very attractive thing to do because the process of promoting your other cards in that suit into winners begins right away. If you lead from such a suit and your partner happens to have been dealt any high card in that suit, it will only help your cause. 

|
pg| ***** 612 ***** |


at|More often than not, however, you will not be dealt any 3-card sequences or interior sequences when you are on opening lead. Usually the suit that you choose to lead from will be a broken holding (that is, one without any 3-card sequence or interior sequence) such as:

nt|^b@2^z@3
The first lesson that we learned about opening leads against notrump was that leading the longest suit that you were dealt will usually be a good start for the defense.  Every bridge hand contains at least 1 suit with at least 4 cards. As such, most of your opening leads against notrump contracts will be from suits with at least 4 cards in them. Furhermore, because we like to lead from strong suits, most of our opening leads against notrump will be from suits that are headed by at least one honor card.

We have seen situations, however, when it is best to lead a short and/or weak suit against notrump. Sometimes the opponents will have bid your longest suit and sometimes your partner will have made a bid (or double) that will cause you to lead a short and/or weak suit.

We will now examine the standard opening leads against notrump from suits that are short (that is, less than 4 cards long) and/or weak (that is, suits with no honor cards):

|cp||at|Most of the opening leads that you will make against notrump contracts will be from suits containing at least 4 cards. The following guidelines can be used to determine which card in the suit that you lead is the standard opening lead:

In each of the following quizzes, assume that you have already decided which suit you are going to select as your opening lead against a notrump contract. Answer as to which card in that suit constitutes the standard opening lead.

Lead the @CK. You have a 3-card sequence of touching honor cards in clubs (the @CKQJ) and the standard opening lead from such a holding is the highest card in the suit. |

Lead the @D10. This is an example of an interior sequence because the suit is headed by one high card (the @DA), followed by a gap, followed by a sequence of at least 2 touching cards (where the highest card below the gap is at least as high as the 10). The standard opening lead from an interior sequence is the second highest card - the @D10 in this case.|

The @H4, the 4th best card in the suit, is the standard opening lead. This heart suit is headed by a sequence, but there are only 2 touching cards in this sequence (the @HQJ). When a suit contains 4 or more cards you need a 3-card sequence in order to lead the highest card against notrump. The 4th best card is the standard opening lead from suits with 4 or more cards that are not headed by a 3-card sequence or interior sequence. If this holding contained the @H10 instead of one of the small hearts, the @HQ would then be the standard opening lead.

The @SK is the standard opening lead from this holding. As with the first holding on this page, this suit is headed by a 2-card sequence of touching honor cards (the @SKQ). Since this suit contains only 3 cards, however, a 2-card sequence is all that is necessary to make the highest card in the suit (the @SK) the standard opening lead.

Lead the @C9. There are not very many deals where you should lead from a doubleton against a notrump contract, but there are occasions when you should lead from a short suit like this (for example, your partner may have bid this suit). If you do decide to lead from a doubleton against notrump, the standard opening lead is the higher of the 2 cards. |

hf|m|lb|*CWhich card would you lead?^^d7^d97642|

hc|d7|ht|m|cs|3|at|^-{ |ih|pd97642|at|}
^-
The standard opening lead from a suit with 4 or more cards and no honor cards is the 2nd highest card, the @D7 in this example.

Some bridge players prefer to lead 4th best (the @D4 in this case) from long weak suits, but the modern tendency is to lead 2nd highest from these holdings. The theory is that leading 2nd highest will often make it easier for your partner to know that you are weak in the suit that you led. On some deals this knowledge will make it easier for partner to defend effectively.

The @H3 is the standard opening lead from this holding. Lead the smallest card from a 3-card holding that is headed by an honor card. Remember that the @H10 is considered to be an honor card! If the holding above contained the @H9 instead of the @H6 or @H3 then it would be correct to lead the @H10. The reason is that @H1093 is a 3-card holding headed by a 2-card sequence and the highest card should be led from such holdings.

Here the @S9 is the standard opening lead. The @S9 is not an honor card and, from a 3-card suit with no honor cards, the highest card should be led. 

|cs|2|at|^-{ Remember, the 10 is the lowest card in each suit that is considered to be an honor card.
10s do not count for any high card points, but 10s count when it comes to selecting a lead! }
