# property  =  <T>[N]{I}    translation
#
#   <T>   source of the Translation
#       'g'      =   Google Translate
#       'i'      =   Orig value, set by {def}
#       'RPf'    =   Roger Pfister  (example)
#       '???'    =   Translators Initials
#
#   [N]    shows a SHORT value  N  is the MAX size
#
#   {I}    Info has many uses
#       'blank'  =   The translator wants the value  EMPTY
#       'x'      =   NOT used by aaBridge
#       'def'    =   creates Orig value in language.properties
