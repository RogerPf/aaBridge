^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 249 - June 18, 2001 ^*N }
^-
|cs|1|at|^-{ ^*BThe double-double at Doubles^*N }
^-
There are 2 ^*BDeals of the Week^*N this week. Both deals were played by ^*BMike Dorn Wiss^*N of Vancouver during a recent visit to ^*BDoubles Duplicate Bridge Club^*N in Toronto. Mike was playing with his long time friend and partner, ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N, when these deals were played.

Mike and Fred have been friends for almost 20 years and Mike was the first expert in the Toronto area (where he lived at the time) to start playing with and mentoring Fred. Mike seems to have a good eye for spotting young bridge talent as he also played an important role in the development of ^*BGeoff Hampson^*N and other juniors who have gone on to become stars.

In both of the deals that are presented this week Mike executed a ^*Bdouble squeeze^*N. Only overtricks were at stake in both cases, but Mike and Fred were playing matchpoints where overtricks can be very important. There are various forms of double squeezes and, although these positions are not considered "rare", it is unusual for a player to declare 2 double squeezes in only 26 deals.

There is a lot you can learn about squeeze technique from studying these 2 deals!

Bridgeplaza was the first web site to produce ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N presentations and, in our view, this site still provides the best tournament coverage anywhere on the web. ^*BKoen Gijsman^*N, the webmaster and driving force behind Bridgeplaza, is helping lead a campaign to keep online vugraph of major events free and accessible to all of the world's bridge players. We are behind Koen 100% on this initiative.

During the last few months online vugraph of some tournaments has been made available only through pay sites. We do not blame these pay sites for wanting to make some money - we blame the tournament organizers for not insisting that the general public is able to watch online vugraph of their events for free.

pg| ***** 2 ***** |


ls|ss|pc|h9|
at|West's opening lead was the @H9, almost certainly a singleton or a doubleton according to the defenders' carding agreements. The contract appeared to be safe, but Mike wanted to try to win as many overtricks as possible. Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on.

pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt|Mike knew that East was the only defender that could guard hearts and it looked like West was long in clubs. He smelled a double squeeze in which each defender would be squeezed in their own suit and diamonds, but Mike needed to do some preparation in order for the squeeze to mature. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|ss|nt|Mike's first preperatory move was to ruff a club in his hand in an attempt to ^*Bisolate the club threat^*N with West. |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|ss|pc|C2|pc|D5|pc|S7|pc|C4|
at|It turned out that West started with 6 clubs so Mike's club ruff was not required (as the club threat was already isolated), but this play would have been necessary if clubs had been 5-3.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


hs|sh|hs|nh|nt|Mike's next preperatory move was to duck a heart trick in order to ^*Brectify the count^*N down to a single loser. Double squeezes do not operate when there is more than 1 loser present. |

pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|Mike had now finished all of the isolation and rectifying that was required. The time for the ^*Bdouble squeeze^*N had come. Do you know which 4 cards each defender had come down to and how Mike was able to win the rest of the tricks from here? |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


sk||hs|wc|hs|eh|hs|ss|nt|Mike knew that West had come down to a winning club and 3 diamonds and that East was holding a winning heart and 3 diamonds. When Mike led his @SA both defenders were squeezed. |

nt|Here is this week's second deal. Mike was the declarer in 3NT after West had bid diamonds and East had bid spades. |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


pc|SQ|
hs|nh|hs|sh|at|West's opening lead was the @SQ and Mike immediately realized that most of the field would play in 4@H. There had been some questionable calls in the auction, but that was not Mike's problem anymore. |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt|Mike had to try to win at least as many tricks as the declarers in hearts would in order to get a good matchpoint score. Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|
hs|ss|nt|Mike allowed West's @SQ to hold the first trick. |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |

pc|S6|pc|S4|pc|S3|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


pc|SJ|pc|S8|pc|SK|
hs|ss|at|West continued with the @SJ, overtaken by East with the @SK and ducked again by Mike. This ducking in spades served 2 purposes. First, Mike wanted to rectify the count down to a single loser (he was assuming the hearts would run). Second, Mike wanted to make 100% sure that the spade guard was isolated in East's hand.|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |

pc|H6|pc|C2|pc|DQ|pc|C3|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


hs|nh|nt|As you have probably figured out by now, dummy's last heart effected a ^*Bdouble squeeze^*N. It did not matter which defender was dealt the @CQ. Can you figure out which 4 cards each defender had come down to and how Mike was able to take the rest of the tricks from here?|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


ls|nh|pc|H4|
sk||hs|ec|hs|es|nt|East was known to be down to a spade winner and 3 clubs. He had to keep his spade winner so he discarded a club. |
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


ls|ec|ls|es|pc|C7|
hs|ss|at|Mike discarded his spade |
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


ls|ss|pc|S9|
hs|wc|hs|wd|at|and now West was squeezed. West's @DK was needed to guard dummy's @D8 so West also came down to a doubleton club. |
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


ls|wc|ls|wd|pc|C4|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sc|nt|Mike now demonstrated that the position of the @CQ was not relevant to the end position as he played the @CJ under dummy's @CA! |

hs|sc|At|and claimed the last trick with the @C8 (yes, Mike can be a bit of a showoff!). |
mc|11|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


ls|sc|up|47|
hs|ed|hs|nh|hs|sh|nt|Despite Mike's fine play, +660 was not a great score for Fred and Mike. Most of the field played 4@H on the North-South cards and received the lead of the @D9 from East. |
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|ls|ed|hs|nc|hs|sc|hs|ec|at|After covering with the @D10, winning the @DJ, and drawing trump, it was now correct to finesse the @CJ in an attempt to make an overtrick. The position of the @CQ was thus relevant after all!|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |
