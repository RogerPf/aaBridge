This week's deal, a declarer play problem, was played by ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President Fred Gitelman during a recent IMP game on ^*BBridge Base Online^*N (BBO). At the critical point there were actually 2 solutions to the problem. Fred found one of these when he was playing and the other solution was pointed out by Fred's friend and partner, ^*BDimitris Danellakis^*N (Dalthor on BBO), a strong player from Greece. This deal has been rotated to make South the declarer.

^*BBridge Base Online^*N is an entirely free site that allows you to do a lot more than just play online bridge. BBO contains an intergrated ^*BBridge Library^*N and ^*BVugraph Theatre^*N, as well as ^*BChat Rooms^*N, a ^*BLecture Hall^*N, and all sorts of training facilities where you can work (either by yourself or with your partner) to improve your game. BBO is growing quickly - please have a  look!

We are planning on producing free live vugraph broadcasts of several major tournaments in 2002 through BBO including the ^*BCap Gemini World Top Pairs^*N (January 17-20) and the ^*BCavendish Invitational Pairs^*N (early May). Make sure you have the latest version of our software ready to go in time for the upcoming ^*BCap Gemini^*N so that you will be able to watch some of the world's best players in live action on your PC!

sk|s|nt|Dalthor, North, dealt and passed and Ladybird, East, opened with a weak 2@S. What call do you think Fred made as South? Both sides were vulnerable (you can tell this by the graphic in the top left corner above - red means vulnerable) and the game was being scored as IMP pairs.|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^d|mb|d|
nt|Fred chose to make a takeout double. He would have liked to have been dealt a 4th heart for this call, but all of the other choices were flawed as well. Passing easily could be the winning action here, but Fred's hand was too strong (even opposite a passed partner) for him to seriously consider this call. The real choice was between 2NT and Double. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


hs|ss|nt|2NT certainly has some appeal as this call would have described Fred's hand accurately in a single bid. Fred ultimately rejected this choice due to his spade holding. Fred thought that it was unlikely that Dalthor would be able to provide much help in spades. Against 3NT East could duck the first round of spades and, unless there were 9 top tricks, that contract would fail.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


ls|ss|nt|Fred also reasoned that, if 3NT is the right contract, there is still a good chance that a takeout double could lead to 3NT. Double also brought some other possible final contracts into play that could not be reached after a 2NT overcall. Nothing is perfect with this hand, but Fred's judgment suggested that Double would have the best chance of success.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


hs|sc|mb|p|mb|2N|an|Lebensohl|mb|p|mb|3C|
nt|After Wm passed as West, Dalthor bid 2NT - the Lebensohl convention. Lebensohl is one of the few conventions that we are willing to recommend without reservation (except for the standard caveat that you should discuss it thoroughly with your partner!). According to this convention, Dalthor's 2NT bid was an artificial relay to 3@C. Fred bid 3@C and awaited Dalthor's reply.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|
nt|Fred was pleased that no reply came! Dalthor passed 3@C, which became the final contract. In Lebensohl, if Dalthor had bid 3@C on the previous round he would have been showing constructive values. The actual sequence is used to show a weaker hand with clubs.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||ls|sc|pc|S9|
at|Wm led the @S9 and, as expected, Dalthor put down a weak hand with clubs. Dalthor's hand was a little weaker and flatter than what Fred was hoping to see. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|at|There was a certain loser in both spades |

ls|ns|ls|ss|hs|nh|hs|sh|at|and hearts |

ls|nh|ls|sh|hs|nd|hs|sd|at|as well as 2 likely losers in diamonds. |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|nc|hs|sc|at|That's 4 losers outside of the trump suit. Ugh! Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|ns|nt|Fred covered Wm's spade opening lead in the dummy |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


ls|ns|pc|sT|pc|SQ|
hs|ss|at|and, when Ladybird in turn covered with the @SQ, Fred won his @SK. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


ls|ss|pc|sK|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sc|at|The percentage play in clubs normally would be to finesse through East twice. However, not only did Fred lack the entries for 2 club finesses, the bidding and early play suggested that Ladybird could not have the @CKQx. Fred therefore laid down the @CA. |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||ls|nc|ls|sc|pc|cA|pc|CK|hs|nc|at|Wm followed with the @CK and Fred unblocked the @CJ from the dummy. |

hs|nc|hs|sc|at|Fred continued with a second round of trump |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|pc|c4|pc|D8|pc|c9|pc|CQ|
at|and Wm discarded an encouraging diamond as Ladybird won the @CQ. |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


pc|D7|
hs|sd|at|Ladybird switched to the @D7. Give your next play some more thought before reading on. |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|At first glance it appeared that there were still 4 inescapable losers (1 spade, 1 heart, and 2 diamonds). Fred thought of a way that he could make his contract from this point, provided that Ladybird had been dealt 6223 distribution. In order for this plan to work, it would be necessary to duck this trick to Wm. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt||ls|sd|pc|d4|pc|DT|pc|d3|

pg| ***** 23 ***** |

pg| ***** 26 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|Sc|pc|c3|pc|H2|pc|cT|pc|C7|at|as Wm discarded a heart. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


at|Assuming that Ladybird had been dealt 6223 distribution (which you need in order to have a chance), there are 2 ways to make the contract from this point. Can you see what they are?|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


hs|ns|nt|Fred actually continued by leading the @SJ from dummy (not the @S6 as he wanted to make sure that Ladybird won the trick). |

pg| ***** 30 ***** |


pc|S8|hs|sh|at|Ladybird continued with the @S8 and Fred discarded a heart from his hand, a ^*Bloser on loser^*N play (a diamond discard is just as good). |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


ls|Sh|pc|h8|pc|H3|pc|s6|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


hs|wd|hs|wh|sk||nt|The purpose of this loser-on-loser play was to ^*Brectify the count^*N down to a single loser in the hope of eventually squeezing Wm in diamonds and hearts. As you can see, Wm had been dealt the sole defensive guards in both red suits and there was no longer any way for the defense to break up the impending squeeze.|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


ls|wh|ls|wd|hs|eh|hs|sh|nt|Ladybird found the strongest defense of exiting in hearts, but Fred carefully won his @HA |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |

ls|wd|hs|nh|at|A heart discard would allow Fred to win the last 2 tricks in hearts. |

hs|ns|nt|
We are now back at the point in the play where Fred exited with the @SJ. Dalthor was quick to point out another way that Fred could have succeeded from this point. Can you see it? |

hs|nh|hs|sh|hs|eh|nt|The alternative winning line is to cash 2 rounds of hearts, eliminating Ladybird's cards in that suit, |

ls|es|pc|s8|
hs|sh|hs|sd|at|but Fred could get home by discarding either his last heart or his last diamond (a ^*Bloser on loser^*N play with a different purpose than the one we saw in Fred's actual line).|

ls|sh|ls|sd|pc|h8|pc|d6|pc|s6|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


hs|es|hs|sd|hs|nc|mc|9|nt|Ladybird would now be endplayed into leading another spade, providing Fred with a ruff and discard. Fred could discard a diamond from either hand while ruffing in the other hand to win the rest of the tricks. Fred's actual line would have led to a similar ending if Ladybird had switched to hearts instead of playing a 3rd round of spades.|

nt|In this deal we have seen 2 examples of what the ^*Bloser on loser^*N play can accomplish. First, this technique was used to ^*Brectify the count^*N for a ^*Bsqueeze^*N. Second, this tecnique was used like a ^*Bthrown in^*N for an ^*Bendplay^*N (except in this deal the defender had been ^*ithrown in^*N already). There are a lot of other ways that the ^*Bloser on loser^*N play can win tricks for you. Be on the lookout for them!|
