^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 271 - November 19, 2001^*N }
^-
|cs|4|at|^-{ ^*BSPECIAL!!! There are 2 Deals of the Week this week!^*N }
^-
Both deals were played during the recent World Championships in Paris, France. This week's first deal was played by ^*BGeir Helgemo^*N of Norway when his team faced Poland during their Bermuda Bowl round robin match. Both Norway and Poland were expected to do well in this year's Bermuda Bowl and these expectations proved accurate as Norway won the Silver Medal while Poland won Bronze. Team USA II (which ^*BFred Gitelman^*N and ^*BSheri Winestock^*N of ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N helped coach) were the winners of the 2001 Bermuda Bowl. 

This week's second deal (which will be presented when you finish reading about the first deal) was played in the Venice Cup by ^*BDaniela von Arnim^*N of Germany. The Germans were playing their round robin match against USA II when this deal took place. Germany eventually defeated France by only 2 IMPs to take the Gold Medal in the Venice Cup after being down 49 IMPs going into the last 16 deals. Von Arnim was the driving force behind this remarkable comeback - she faced a number of difficult problems and solved them all correctly.

hs|sh|nt|Helgemo, South, and partner ^*BTor Helness^*N faced Poland's ^*BKrzysztof Martens^*N (West) and ^*BMarcin Lesniewski^*N (East) when this week's first deal was played. Lesniewski dealt and passed and Helgemo-Helness had a natural auction to 4@H, the opponents passing throughout. |

ls|sh|pc|C4|
nt|Marten's led the @C4. Like most of the top Polish pairs, Martens-Lesniewski lead low from a worthless doubleton and lead the middle card from a 3-card suit. While it is true that you would probably want to be in 3NT (or 5@C) with these cards, there is nothing you can do about that now. Think about how you would play 4@H as declarer before reading on. |

pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|Helgemo had reached the critical point of the hand and now had a big decision to make. He knew that Martens had either started with 2443 or 2353 distribution. |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


sk||hs|sh|hs|wh|at|If Martens had been dealt 2443, he was down to all hearts now and Helgemo would have to exit with the @H8 to make his contract from here. Martens would win and be endplayed into leading into Helgemo's @HAQ.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |

pg| ***** 28 ***** |


up|4|hs|sh|ls|es|md|0,ht,,d9|nt|After about 10 seconds thought (which is quite a lot when Helgemo is playing the hand), Helgemo chose to exit with the @H8. That proved to be a smart move as Martens had been dealt the @HKJ109. |

hs|wh|hs|sh|mc|10|at|Helgemo claimed the last 2 tricks for a very satisfying +620. |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


hs|wh|up|43|
nt|While Helgemo was surely satisfied, we were quite impressed to see Martens reaction when his 3 "certain" trump tricks became 2. Krzysztof Martens enjoys the beauty of the game as much as anyone and their was nothing except joy and admiration on his face when he saw Helgemo put the @H8 on the table in the endgame. It's nice to see this happen in the heat of battle.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


hs|eh|nt|We are not completely sure how Helgemo figured out the distribution in the endgame. It may have been his great table presence or an attempt to calculate the odds, but we suspect that his main clue was that Lesniewski ruffed the third round of clubs with the @H3. Lesniewski probably would have ruffed with his highest trump in this position. We suspect that Helgemo drew this inference.|

nt|In this week's second deal (which has been rotated to make South the declarer) ^*BDaniela von Arnim^*N of Germany played in 6@H. Many consider von Arnim and ^*BSabine Auken^*N to be the best female pair in the world, but some would also choose their opponents on this deal, Americans ^*BMildred Breed^*N (West) and ^*BShawn Quinn^*N (East) for that honor.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


ls|sh|pc|C6|
nt|Breed led the @C6 and, although Auken put down a nice dummy, von Arnim clearly had some work to do. Think about the play before reading on, but keep in mind that some bridge deals (like both of this week's deals) are too complex even for great players to form a complete plan at trick 1. Fortunately, strong general technique at the beginning of the play often leads to a happy ending. |
