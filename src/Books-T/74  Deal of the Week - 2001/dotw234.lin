3d|5|rh||ah|Deal of the|ah|Week #234|
bt||nt||cs|3|va|6|at|^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 234 - March 5, 2001 ^*N }
^-
This week's deal was misplayed by ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N during the ^*BNations Cup^*N at the recent ^*BForbo-Krommenie^*N tournament^*N in Scheveningen, The Netherlands. The Forbo is arguably the strongest invitational team tournament in the world. The generosity of Forbo-Krommenie and the hard work of the local organizers have helped to make the Forbo among the best run tournaments we have ever attended. Complete coverage of this tournament, including ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N, is available through:

Fred was playing with his regular partner, ^*BBrad Moss^*N, when this week's deal was played. Despite Fred's poor bidding and play on this deal, his team (which also included ^*BJohn Carruthers^*N and ^*BHoward Weinstein^*N) went on the win the ^*BNations Cup^*N. This was a pretty exciting event to win because the other 3 teams that participated were representing 3 of the strongest bridge-playing countries in the world: Italy, Poland, and The Netherlands.

Fred and Brad were playing against ^*BJan Jansma^*N and ^*BLouk Verhees^*N of The Netherlands in the final round of the ^*BNations Cup^*N when this weeks deal was played. Fred and Brad were very impressed by the strong play of this fine young pair as well as their excellent deportment at the table, even when the match was obviously going against them. We expect that you will be hearing the names Jansma and Verhees more and more in the years to come. This deal has been rotated to make South the declarer.

What call do you think Fred made? Fred and Brad play a natural system with 5-card majors and 14+-17 1NT openings.|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


nt||lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^1D|mb|1D|hs|sd|
nt|Fred chose to open 1@D (mostly because 1@D is the systemic opening with 4-4 in the minors for Fred and Brad). There is a good reason to consider opening 1@C with this particular hand. If partner has long diamonds and 4 or 5 points he will probably respond 1@D to 1@C, making it possible to reach a good 5@D, 6@D or 3NT. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|After a 1@D opening, however, if partner has a sub-minimum response with a long club suit, he is likely to pass and 1@D may well be the final contract. This benefit to opening 1@C is not exactly high frequency and there are some possible auctions in which opening 1@C with this pattern will lead to problems. Still, 1@C could easily be the winner at the table.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


mb|P|mb|1H|mb|P|
ls|sd|nt|The opponents passed throughout and Brad responded 1@H as North. What call do you think Fred chose as his rebid? |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^2S|
mb|2s|hs|ss|nt|Fred chose to jump shift to 2@S - a bid that would get the approval of most textbooks (where opener is generally expected to jump shift with 19 HCP). Despite what the textbooks say, in retrospect we think that 1@S would have a been a better call. An important lesson we learned from ^*BJoey Silver^*N reveals why: ^*BA jump shift is a statement, not a question^*N.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|What this means is that a jump shift is not simply an expression of high card strength - it should be based on a hand that can control the auction. Fred did not know where he was going with his hand. He simply had a lot of points. His choice of 2@S crowded the auction, making it impossible to discover a possible club fit on some layouts.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt|Another problem with 2@S is that this call would normally suggest longer diamonds than spades (which turned out to be a serious problem on the actual deal). A 1@S rebid is not without risk as 1@S is non-forcing. However, it would be very rare for Brad to pass 1@S here (especially given the partnership bidding style where all balanced hands rebid in notrump).|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt|If Brad had a hand that called for a pass of a 1@S rebid, then it would be very possible that there was no playable game contract in the cards. We have managed to convince ourselves that 1@S is a better rebid than 2@S with Fred's hand. We hope we have convinced you as well!|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


ls|Ss|mb|P|mb|3D|mb|P|mb|3N|
nt|Brad took preference to 3@D and Fred rebid 3NT. |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


mb|P|mb|4S|mb|P|mb|5C|
hs|sc|at|Brad took this out to 4@S, a clear cuebid in support of diamonds (as opposed to a suggestion of a final contract). Fred was now feeling a bit sick about the whole thing (and wishing he had rebid 1@S instead of 2@S). He thought he had to follow through, however, and therefore cuebid 5@C. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


mb|P|mb|5S|mb|P|mb|6D|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|
ls|sc|hs|sd|nt|Brad tried for a grand slam with 5@S, but Fred knew he held the wrong hand for 7@D. If all Brad needed was 5 keycards to make 7@D then he would have bid Roman Key Card Blackwood at an earlier point in the auction. Fred thus retreated to 6@D which became the final contract. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||ls|sd|pc|CK|nt|And what a poor final contract it was! Louk led the @CK and Fred was not at all pleased with the sight of the dummy. Yes, Brad did a lot of bidding (his 5@S call was especially aggressive), but, if Fred had been dealt a similar hand with a 5th diamond that his 2@S rebid would normally deliver, then 6@S would have been an very good contract.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt|Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on. Fred did not find the correct line of play at the table, but he should have - this is not that hard a problem.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


hs|sc|nt|The first key play comes at trick 1. It is correct to allow West's @CK to win the first trick. There is a good reason for this. If you do not see it already we will explain it to you soon. |

hs|sc|hs|nd|nt|You can now ruff a club in dummy and you should be able to see why it was correct to allow the defense to win the first trick. If you had won the @CA at trick 1, you would have to surrender a club trick now and that would give the defense a chance to take the setting trick with the @HK. |

hs|eh|hs|wh|hs|ed|hs|wd|nt|We are pretty sure that the line of play just described is correct, but this line would not have worked on the actual lie of the cards. The @DQ was doubleton, but the evil 7-1 heart break meant that Louk would have been able to take the setting trick by overruffing Fred in hearts. With all of the cards in view, can you see how Fred could have made his contract on the actual layout?|
