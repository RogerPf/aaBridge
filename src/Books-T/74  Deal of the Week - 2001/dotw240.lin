pg| ***** 2 ***** |


ls|es|ls|nh|ls|sh|ls|eh|at|The actual contract was 3NT, however, after South chose to open 2NT and North made the questionable decision not to use Stayman. Declarer would not have much trouble making 3NT if West were to make the natural lead of a spade, |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


ls|ws|hs|wd|at|but suppose West leads a small diamond instead. |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |

hs|ss|hs|sh|hs|sc|at|What looks like an easy deal all of the sudden becomes difficult when the South hand is squeezed in 3 suits on the 4th round of diamonds. There are 2 ways that declarer can get home from this point. Can you see them?|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ls|sh|ls|ss|ls|sc|pf|y|nt|You can now experiment with how the play could go from here. Click on the cards you want to play for all 4 players. The  ^$6  button on the toolbar below can be used at any point to take back the last card that you played. When you are ready to read the answer, click the  ^$40  button on the toolbar below.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


pf|n|hs|sh|hs|sc|nt|In order to make the contract from this point, either a middle heart or a club must be discarded from the South hand. If the @H6 is discarded from the South hand instead, the hearts will become blocked, making it impossible for declarer to take more than a single finesse in that suit.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


ls|sc|nt|Suppose first that South discards a middle heart. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |

pg| ***** 22 ***** |


ls|ns|pc|sq|pc|h3|hs|sh|at|the South hand is caught in a ^*Bone-suit squeeze^*N! If the @H6 is discarded, the hearts will block leaving declarer able to take only 1 finesse in that suit. If instead the @HQ or @HJ is pitched from the South hand, East can then cover dummy's @H9 and build the setting trick in hearts. |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


up|10|ls|sh|hs|nc|hs|sc|nt|In order to avert the one-suit squeeze against South's hearts, declarer must make the strange play over overtaking one of South's club honors with dummy's @CA on either the first or second round of clubs! |

pg| ***** 37 ***** |


up|12|ls|nh|ls|sh|hs|ns|nt|The end position above is known as an ^*Bentry squeeze^*N. Entry squeezes are among the many exotic card play themes that were analyzed by ^*BHugh Kelsey^*N and ^*BGeza Otlik^*N in their classic book on (very) advanced technique, ^*BAdventures in Card Play^*N. |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt|The ^*Bentry squeeze^*N gets its name due to its unusual property of not gaining a trick directly, but only an entry. The entry that is gained can later be used to gain an extra trick. The entry squeeze was necessary on this deal in order to counter the threat of a ^*Bone-suit squeeze^*N in hearts.|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


ls|ns|up|17|
hs|sc|nt|The other solution to this deal is not quite as elegant, but it is still interesting. We have seen how declarer can succeed after discarding a middle heart on the 4th round of diamonds, but he can also make 3NT if he discards any of his clubs. Suppose South discards the @C2.|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |

hs|ns|hs|sh|at|If declarer cashed the @SQ now, his hearts would be one-suit squeezed as before and the contract would fail. |

ls|ns|hs|nh|hs|eh|nt|The @H9 must first be led through East (who cannot afford to cover).|

pg| ***** 52 ***** |


ls|ns|pc|sq|hs|eh|hs|ec|hs|sh|hs|nc|at|East is caught in a ^*Bsimple squeeze^*N on this trick. A club discard will establish dummy's @C9 as a winner and a heart discard will allow declarer to run that suit. This squeeze allows declarer to get back the trick he had to give up when he overtook one of his club winners in dummy.|
