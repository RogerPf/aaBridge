This week's deal was played by ^*BSimon de Wijs^*N of The Netherlands during the Teams event at the recent International Bridge Festival in Madeira, Portugal. We would like to thank our friend ^*BOnno Eskes^*N (also from The Netherlands) for sharing this deal with us. Onno was Simon's partner when this week's deal was played. Simon and Onno (along with ^*BWillem van Eijck^*N and ^*BBrian Jackson^*N) went on to win the Teams event in Madeira. This was an especially impressive victory given that Simon and Onno were also responsible for producing the Daily Bulletins at this tournament (which meant that they probably averaged about 4 hours of sleep each night)!

Regular readers of ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N will be familiar with Simon's name as he has played some spectacular hands which have been reported previously in this feature. Simon is one of several young stars from The Netherlands, arguably the country in which bridge is most popular and healthy nowadays.

The Dutch are very good at both playing and marketing our game. They also run some of the best and most prestigious bridge tournaments in the world. We suspect that many players would consider the ^*BCap Gemini World Top Pairs^*N, run each January in The Hague, as the finest bridge tournament of them all (in terms of the level of play, the playing conditions, and the organization).

Simon opened 2@C as South and rebid 3NT (showing 24-25 HCP) over Onno's 2@D waiting response. Onno raised to 6NT which became the final contract. |
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


pc|S3|nt|West's opening lead was the @S3 (4th best). When Onno sent us this deal he remarked that he was glad he had not looked for a 4-4 heart fit as 6@H would be a better, but less interesting, contract. In 6@H there is not much more to the play than just taking 2 finesses. 6NT turned out to be quite another story. Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on.|

hs|wd|nt|In order to examine the 1-suit squeeze more closely, let's go back to the point where Simon cashed his final major suit winner. Suppose that West had postponed the inevitable by discarding a diamond on this trick. |

lc|c3|hc|ck|at|Obviously it doesn't do West any good to discard the @CK, |

hs|nc|nt|It is in this variation that Simon's farsighted unblocking play of discarding the @C8 becomes relevant. We are completely confident that, had the play gone this way, Simon would have continued his good work by leading the @C7 to the next trick. |

hs|ec|at|East must cover with the @C9 (or else Simon would duck the trick to West). |
