There is one no-trump and seventeen suit contracts presented in this movie. In all of the deals you are the declarer and you join the table after the opening lead has been made. 

Each deal is analysed using STOP procedure:
S: Stop to consider your goal
T: Tally your losers
O: Organize your plan 
P: Put your plan into action


At any time you can declare a deal that you will be watching by pressing the '1st' or 'Cont' buttons in the lower right section of the screen. The buttons will become available once you watch the deal.  |

It is very tempting to start out with a finesse in diamonds. This will fail and the opponents will knock out your last stopper in the spade suit and when the diamonds don't split, you are down a bunch! However, it does not take any special wizardry to realize that if you just knock out the Ace of hearts, you will promote two heart tricks and make your contract, without having to resort to any finesse in diamonds!!!
Only if promotion won't "do the trick" so to say, should you look at a finesse or suit development.|

I would like to spend some time explaining what a Master Hand is and why it is important when declaring a bridge hand in a suit contract.^^
In order to always try and maintain 'control' of the trump suit, one of the two hands -  declarer's or dummy, must initially be designated as the MASTER. It is not always the stronger or the declarer's hand. This, among other things, is the hand 
- whose trump length you do not wilfully shorten unless you have a very good reason for doing so, and
- whose looser count matters.^^
In effect, after you have eliminated all possible losers from this Master hand, the rest of its cards become winners. In bridge terms, the hand 'reads'!^^
The hand that is opposite to the Master Hand is referred to as the Supporting Hand.

A loser is any card in the master hand that is not a sure winner and that can not be 'covered' by a high card in the supporting hand.

Here are two examples where the choice of the Master hand may seem counterintuitive.

PUT THE PLAN INTO ACTION
Winning the Ace of diamonds in hand, she leads the Q of hearts and runs it (merely as a formality and an entry saving duck). Later, you will encounter many examples where this ducking play is very important in creating an extra entry to the hand, whose losers you would like to ruff. It is now too late for opponents to stop her from carrying on her plan. Best bet is to lead a trump won by West and back with another trump. But declarer still has a trump left in hand with which to ruff the heart loser.|

This is a hand that many intermediate (and even Advanced) level players would struggle with. Not really knowing how to proceed and what to do and when to do it. And all because they are trained to look at making the hand from the perspective of their 'strong hand' and not dummy's.^^

When trying to decide the 'Master hand', an 'acid test' is to count losers in each hand. The hand with fewer losers should be the Master hand. 

From the North perspective her losers are: 1@s + 2@h +2@d + 1@c = 6 losers

From the South perspective her losers are: 1@s + 1@h +3@d + 3@c = 8 losers

Even though South is the 'BIG HAND', the North hand is the MASTER HAND. This, in essence, is the quintessential meaning of the term "MASTER HAND" - the hand that has fewer losers to eliminate and therefore should be easier to play is the BOSS hand!^^
Think about this next time that you open 1NT and you end up playing in a heart or spade contract after partner has made a transfer bid into that major suit.^^

At all times with (5-3), (6-3) or (5-4) trump split the hand with longer trumps should be chosen as the Master Hand.

With (4-4) or (5-5) trump split either hand can be the Master hand. This is an advantage that these trump splits enjoy over other splits and because of this, a good declarer is often able to generate an additional trick (or two) when playing in a 4-4 fit versus a 5-3 fit.

In order to choose the Master Hand when trump split evenly, one must consider a number of factors. But first, if the opponents' lead forces declarer to ruff in one or the other hand, then that hand automatically becomes the Support hand and the other hand still with four trumps intact, becomes the Master hand. Otherwise the other factors to consider are:

- loser count from both sides
- the length of side suits,
- trump quality,
- and entries.|

SELECTION OF THE MASTER HAND
It may seem like the intuitive thing to make dummy the support hand in view of the fact that it has a singleton club. However this would be a mistake. In trying to ruff out the club suit, declarer can easily lose control of the hand even with as 'robust' a trump suit as they have. Even though the loser count from each side is tied at 6, North should be the Master Hand based on two factors:
- the length of the side suit, (5 versus 4) and
- the quality of the trump suit.|

It is more difficult to select your order of play in a suit contract than it is at notrump. The reason is that there are usually more ways to win tricks (and also to lose them!)
In no trump, you can win tricks only with high cards or long cards, so the contracts are hard to fulfill but easy to plan.
In suits, you can win extra tricks by trumping, so contracts are easier to make; but there are more decisions to be made before you come up with the correct line of attack.

Roughly, there are four methods of playing suit contracts.
Each one has its own problems and techniques, and we will examine them individually. 
1. Ruff losers with dummy's trumps
2. Establish a long side suit in your hand or dummy
3. Win the honors which are nearly high
4. Win small trumps in your own hand by ruffing.

The single most important quality of a good declarer is that she knows which of these four campaigns she is embarked on.
If she keeps her eye on the method she has selected for producing extra tricks, she is likely to make her contract.

But if she adopts a common fifth approach, much favored by some of your partners-
5. Try a little of each, and hope for the best. 
She will probably go down..

Since West has made a trump lead, that limits us to only two ruffs in dummy. There are 7 clubs missing and we expect these to split 4-3 more often than not. Hence if we can ruff two clubs in dummy, then we shall develop a length trick in clubs after giving up a trick. This should do the trick, since we shall now only have one loser in the club suit.^^|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


at|Any precaution to be aware of? Yes!
Since we have to give the lead to the opponents at least once towards the end of the hand, we cannot afford to risk losing control of the trump suit. Therefore we must be careful how we use the small trumps in our hand to create entries in order to ruff more clubs.

at|^b@2Trumping in your own hand is usually ill-advised, as I have recently pointed out to you. The first three plans for playing suit contracts that we have just examined are by far the most common; one of them should be employed in close to 90% of all deals.
However, there is a rare fourth approach
- producing extra trumps by ruffing repeatedly in your own hand.
It should only be used as an advanced technique if you understand it well and know what you are doing!|

Explaining it within the context of this hand:
After the trump opening lead, declarer stands to win 4 trump tricks in her own hand plus another 2 in dummy by ruffing clubs - for a total of 6, at most. However, if she can use the small trumps in her own hand to ruff the hearts then her tally of tricks will be 7. Together with her Aces in the other 3 suits, she would now have 10 tricks!
Note that this is NOT a cross ruff operation because here the emphasis is on ruffing hearts, with the club ruffs simply being used as an incidental entry to dummy in order to ruff more hearts!|

Let's quickly review what we saw.
As already emphasized, usually, the greater trump length will be in declarer's hand. Thus, every ruff in dummy represents an extra winner, for declarer's own length is maintained.
You can go through four simple steps when planning to get rid of losers in your hand by trumping them in dummy:
1. Recognize the hand patterns where the opportunity exists.
2. The trumps in dummy have to be carefully handled.
3. You need to be aware that you might have to play the suit more than once, perhaps giving up the lead while doing it.
4. Do you have to arrange transport, or entries, to anable your plan of action?

Whenever there is a side suit in which your own hand is longer than dummy, you should consider this plan. This is obvious when you hold a real two suiter.

In the next four boards we will be using the 'ruffing in dummy' technique. |

The average declarer draws trumps, and complains about her bad luck when the hearts split 4-2 and she goes down!
A slightly more sophisticated declarer might give herself the extra chance of setting up dummy's club suit.

Observe that it is not necessary to have a very short side suit in dummy, or a very long one in your hand in order to adopt this plan. All you need is GREATER length in your own hand than in dummy.

A precaution to note that was necessary when playing this hand, is for declarer not to draw EVEN one round of trumps, before clearing the hearts.
If she did otherwise, the opponents might win the Ace and play a second round of trumps. Later when they win their heart trick, they may be nasty enough to play a third round of trumps - and there goes your ruff!!|

We now turn our attention to PLAN TWO - USING DUMMY'S LENGTH.

In most lines of play, declarer takes advantage of the distribution of dummy.
We have seen her making use of a side suit in which dummy has fewer cards than she has, by ruffing her losers with dummy's trumps.

Just as easily, she may use a suit in which dummy has more cards than her own hand
- here, to discard losers instead of ruffing them.
Of course, such a suit must have either extra honors which will be high when declarer has no cards remaining, or great length (usually 5 cards or more) so that the little cards can be established.|

You might obtain a discard by leading towards the Q of hearts. However this is not a good line of attack, since, with 5 losers, you need to find a way to eliminate two and the heart play can only provide one discard.

In this example you saw both sorts of length in dummy which can be productive:
- a 5 card or longer holding in which the small cards can be established as in the club suit,
- or intermediate honors, as in the heart suit, which may provide discards.
When such length is available, using it will often be your best plan.
You should think about these hands much as you do about a NT contract.
How many winners do I have?
Will this suit provide the extra tricks that I need?
Then go about establishing the winners, and cashing the tricks
- usually in that order.

Just as in notrump contracts, you may have to worry about cashing your tricks before the opponents get theirs - it may be a race.
And many of the methods which help you win the race at notrump are important in suit contracts played according to this plan.|

Dummy's shortness in clubs need not to be considered - this will only eliminate 2 losers. However dummy's length in spades will provide the 3 discards that you require, after the suit is set up. The danger is that the enemy will win two diamonds and one spade before you can take your discards and a losing heart finesse sets you. Obviously, from the lead, the K-Q of diamonds are behind dummy. If you play the 10 and win the Q with your Ace, you will likely go down, if the left hand opponent (LHO) has the spade Ace. Then she will lead through dummy's diamond J before you can take your discards.|

PUT THE PLAN INTO ACTION
The solution is to hold off your diamond Ace.
Cover the lead with dummy's 10, and let the Q hold to your right. This does not gain a trick directly, as your right hand opponent will not lead from her diamond K. But it gains time. Now you can knock out the spade Ace while retaining control of the dangerous suit. You will win your ten tricks before the opponents take their four.

You must reduce your loser count by 2. Dummy's diamonds will provide enough winners on which to discard the losers. You must draw trumps before you can run the diamonds. And if you lose a finesse to the Q of spades while attempting to draw trumps, the enemy may cash 4 tricks - one spade, one heart two clubs - before you can take your discards.
Here however, this danger only exists if your left hand opponent regains the lead to play through dummy's club K. So you must use 'avoidance' technique to keep the 'danger hand' - the dangerous opponent off the lead.|

at|Notice, though, that you must be sure to save three entries to dummy - two to lead spades, and one to get back to cash the trick that you have worked so hard to establish.

Just as entries to your own hand should be your worry when you plan to use dummy's shortness in order to ruff losers, entries to dummy are your constant pre-occupation when you plan to use dummy's length. This is the main reason that these two lines of attack are, as we shall see soon, mutually exclusive - you can sometimes do either, but you can almost never do both at once. Again a little bit of this and a little bit of that, just does not work.

In fact, the number of entries in a hand and how they are located between declarer's and dummy's hand is so important that you should study it carefully and always pay attention to this key factor, when attempting to determine which of the plans you should adopt as declarer: PLAN 1 - ruffing in dummy or PLAN 2 - using dummy's long suit.

Recall when we were looking at examples of ruffing in dummy, I asked you to always be cognizant of the following key factors that determine whether it was feasible to attempt to ruff away declarer's hand losers with dummy's trumps. In order to employ the ruffing technique successfully, it becomes necessary to always take the following into consideration:

1) A pre-condition is that the length of the side suit in declarer's hand that needs to be ruffed must be greater than dummy's by at least one card.

2) Some precautions must also be observed, namely:
     - taking care to leave enough trumps in dummy
     - protecting, if possible, against over ruffs and
     - protecting, if possible, against having your honors ruffed.

3) Another key factor for success is ensuring that you have enough entries to your hand so that you can ruff as many times as is necessary. That number must be at least as many times that you plan to ruff +1, to get you back to your hand in order to draw any outstanding trumps. With fewer than the ideal number, you have to hope that the adverse suit splits in a favorable manner (for example 3-3 and not 4-2).|

Simlarly, in order to employ the PLAN 2 technique successfully (using the length in dummy's side suit), it becomes necessary to always take the following into consideration:

1) A pre-condition is that the length of the side suit in dummy that needs to be set up for extra winners, must be greater than that in declarer's hand by at least 1 card. The actual length itself is not important, just that this difference in length must exist.

2) Some precautions must also be observed, namely:
	- taking care to leave enough trumps in hand to ruff with
	- protecting, if possible, against over ruffs in your hand, and
	- protecting, if possible, against having any of your high honors ruffed.

3) There is however, over and above all of these, another key factor that is required in order to be successful, namely: that you have enough entries from your hand to dummy so that you can ruff as many times as is necessary. Again that number must be at least as many times that you plan to ruff +1, in order to be able to get back to dummy to enjoy your winners. Likewise, with fewer than the ideal number, you have to hope that the adverse suit splits in a favorable manner (for example 3-3 and not 4-2).

Because both of these plans rely so much on the availability of the proper number of entries, you usually must decide, often before playing to the first trick, which plan you will adopt. Although you cannot use both the length and shortness of dummy, (PLAN 2 and PLAN 1), occasionally you will be able to use either, or so it will seem. Then, your choice is made according to the location of entries:
- with many entries to dummy and few in your hand, you plan to set up the length in dummy for discards; hence PLAN2, and
- with many entries to your hand and few to dummy, you plan to use the shortness in dummy by ruffing losers from your hand; hence PLAN 1.

This then is the answer to the question that you all must be asking:
HOW TO DECIDE WHICH ONE TO USE!

As we continue looking at some more examples, pay particular attention to the entry situation; I will also try and point it out. 

Talking of entries, with enough entries you can occasionally set up the most anemic 5-card suit as we shall see in the following hand.|

Win the Ace, and lead a low spade.

Play the 4 of hearts to dummy's 9, ruff another spade high.
Overtake the 7 of hearts with the 10 and ruff the 4th round of spades.
Now dummy's last spade is probably good (if thet divided 4-3), and you have the diamond Ace as the entry to the good spade.

Notice the care that you had to take to keep four entries to dummy, ruffing with honors to save your more valuable little spots.

This is a common entry saving method.
Another device for producing an extra entry to dummy we have probably seen in NT play.|

Against your 4 spade contract, the defense cashes two club tricks and leads a third round which you ruff.

If the missing diamonds are split 3-3, then all we would require is to ruff once and the suit will be set up. Hence, we would only need 2 entries to dummy (1 +1). 
However if we are more realistic and expect a split of 4-2, then we shall need to ruff two diamonds and hence require 3 entries to dummy in order to accomplish this. Two to ruff in hand and the third to get back to dummy, to collect your diamond winner.

There is no realistic way to make the contract if the trumps don't split 3-2. Hence we can reduce the loser count by two in all our planning endeavours. So with 5 losers, we must find a way to eliminate 4 of them in order to make our contract.
There is no feasible way to ruff enough spade losers in dummy,
However, if the diamonds split no worse that 4-2, then by losing a diamond trick, we can set up 4 diamond winners.|

Lets look at the entry situation to see if this Plan is feasible.

PUT THE PLAN INTO ACTION
Win the opening lead, play to the Ace of diamonds and lead the Q letting it ride for a finesse, if it is not covered. This way you can throw your heart loser on the diamond Q and may make your contract even though the finesse loses. If you finesse on the first round, you are down immediately should the finesse lose for a heart will be cashed.|

Suppose that the diamond K wins to your left; you trump the heart return. Now you must draw trumps and get to dummy to run the diamonds. Cash your Ace of clubs and your K of clubs, and lead to dummy's club Q. If the trumps split reasonably, you are home free.|
PG| ***** 168 ***** |

Observe that you do not need a ruff in dummy to take 12 tricks.
In fact it would be fatal to ruff, for the minute you shorten dummy's trump holding, the diamond suit is dead for lack of an entry.
You could no longer draw trumps ending up in dummy.
This deal is a good example of knowing what your Plan is, from the start!|

If you plan to ruff clubs in dummy, then you need three entries to your hand  - two to ruff the clubs and a third to draw trumps.
But you only have two - the K of diamonds and a trump, since if you use both of dummy's two little trumps to get back to your hand, you will surely get so tangled up that you will end up going down.
The better plan must therefore be to set up dummy's hearts for you have more entries in dummy.|

Ruff a heart (with an honor if necessary).

If you intend to trump losers, you must win the opening in dummy, saving your own entry for later, and lead clubs.
