^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 387 - February 9, 2004^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
This week's deal is a 3-part story about what really happened, what could have happened, and what should have happened in a deal that I played last week at an ACBL Regional tournament in Hilton Head, South Carolina (nice tournament and nice place!).

I had the pleasure of playing with ^*BAlan Sontag^*N throughout the Hilton Head Regional. Alan is an extraordinarily gifted (and speedy!) bridge player, a perfect partner, and a lot of fun both at and away from the table. His classic book, ^*IThe Bridge Bum^*N, has recently been republished by ^*BMasterpoint Press^*N.

hs|sh|nt|I was the dealer and both side were vulnerable. My hand felt like a weak 2-bid, but I chose to defer to point count and open 1@H. |
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


ls|sh|mb|P|mb|3C|an|Artificial raise with 4-card support|
at|West passed and Alan responded 3@C. This showed 4-card heart support and either a balanced limit raise or a minimum game force with a singleton somewhere. |
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


mb|3S|mb|?|

at|East came in with 3@S and I had to decide what to do. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


hs|sh|nt|I judged that my chances of making 4@H were more than enough to justify bidding a vulnerable game, but I had to consider the possibility that West might bid 4@S. |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


ls|sh|hs|sd|at|There is a case to be made for being able to bid 4@D to show your second suit in order to help your partner make a decision at the 5-level, but Alan and I had not discussed this - I would expect him to interpret 4@D as a slam try. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


mb|4h|ls|sd|hs|sh|nt|
In the end (actually in about 2 seconds) I bid 4@H - after all, West doesn't always bid 4@S does he? |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


ls|sh|mb|4S|
nt|
Yes, West always bids 4@S. It looked liked I was going to have another decision to make... |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


hs|sh|mb|5H|
nt|I was grateful when Alan made the decision for me and went on to 5@H. No doubt he had a great all around hand with a singleton spade. Still, I expected to be doubled and I expected to go down. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|at|It turned out that neither of of these expectations came to pass (shows what I know).|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ls|sh|ls|ss|pc|SA|hs|ss|nt|West's opening lead of the @SA was good news - I had thought that my @SK was my greatest defensive asset, but that card was not working. It looked like a club opening lead would have beaten 4@S for sure, but Alan's 5@H bid came quickly (no shock there) - I had not decided what I was going to lead if we ended up defending 4@S.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


hs|sh|ls|ss|nt|Perhaps I distracted myself by thinking about stupid and irrelevant things like how many spades the opponents might be able to make because I misplayed this contract badly. Turns out I got lucky at end and made my contract, but I did not deserve to do so. Here is Part 1 of the story - what really happened... |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


ls|sh|pc|S3|pc|S4|pc|S6|
nt|East followed to the first trick with the @S4, a suit preference signal for clubs according to the defenders' agreements. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


pc|C9|hs|nc|at|West obediently switched to the @C9. All indications were that the @CK was with East so I went up with dummy's @CA |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


ls|nc|pc|CA|pc|C2|pc|CQ|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sh|at|and played a heart toward my hand. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|pc|H4|pc|H3|pc|HK|pc|S2|
at|East followed small and West discarded the @S2. Think about how you would continue as declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|sh|nt|I could see no reason to do anything other than drive out the @HA now. |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


ls|sh|
pc|HQ|pc|S7|pc|H5|pc|HA|at|After taking his @HA, |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


pc|HT|
hs|sh|at|East returned his remaining trump to me. |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


ls|sh|pc|HJ|pc|C4|pc|H8|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|at|The fate of the deal was going to come down to the diamonds and I did not like my chances of being able to play that suit for no losers. Naturally I tried to find out more about the defenders hands before I had to broach the diamonds.|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|ss|hs|nh|nt|A discard from the dummy was not going to help me so I ruffed my winning @SK |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


ls|ss|ls|nh|
pc|SK|pc|ST|pc|H9|pc|S5|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sh|at|and ruffed the @C3 in my hand (playing for something that would help me - a doubleton @CK with East). |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sh|
pc|C3|pc|C5|pc|H2|pc|C6|
at|No such luck. Both defenders followed small. What now?|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


hs|sd|nt|I will show you what I did then I will tell you why I played as I did. I led the @D3 out of my hand |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


ls|sd|
pc|D3|pc|D4|
hs|nd|at|and, when West followed small, I played the @DA from the dummy! |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


ls|nd|pc|DA|pc|DK|at|This worked spectacularly well. After East's @DK dropped, |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


sk||hs|nc|hs|sh|hs|ec|at|it was a simple matter to ruff out East's @CK |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sh|ls|ec|
pc|CT|pc|CK|pc|H6|pc|C7|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


hs|es|at|and claim the rest of the tricks. As to why I played diamonds the way I did, notice that East has only spades left. |mc|11|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt|It's not so much East's length in spades, but his lack of diamonds that is relevant. |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


ls|es|hs|ed|up|6|hs|nd|at|At the point that I played the dummy's @DA, I was fairly certain that East was dealt 1 diamond at the most - my only chance to make 4@S was that he had a singleton @DK (I did not have the spots to pick up a singleton @D10 or @D9 in his hand). |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


ls|nd|nt|Knowing that East was short in diamonds was simply matter of counting the hand. |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


ls|ed|hs|es|at|East, with a marginal hand, surely had 6-card spade suit for his 3@S overcall. |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


ls|es|hs|ec|at|I already knew that East was dealt 3 hearts and, if his trick 1 signal was to be believed, East was dealt at least 3 cards in clubs. |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


ls|ec|hs|ed|at|There was room for at most 1 diamond in his hand. I had to hope it was the @DK. Lucky me!|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|ed|up|5|hs|ec|nt|Part 1 of this story, what really happened, is now complete. Part 2, what could have happened, begins at the point at which I ruffed the dummy's @C3  in my hand. Suppose that East, instead of following small, had risen with the @CK instead! |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


ls|ec|pc|ck|hs|sh|nt|I would have ruffed in my hand, |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


ls|sh|pc|h2|pc|c6|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


hs|nc|Hs|sd|at|and, with 2 club winners in the dummy for diamond discards, |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


hs|ed|ls|nc|hs|nd|at|I would have pinned my hopes on the diamond finesse. That would suit the defense just fine, of course. |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|ls|ed|pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dj|pc|dk|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


mc|10|at|The @CK falsecard would be a pretty sensational play for East to make, but it is not that hard to find if you think about it (quickly!). |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


up|12|nt|That's the end of Part 2, what could have happened on this deal. On to Part 3 - what should have happened. I mentioned earlier that I misplayed this deal. Can you see where I went wrong and how I should have played? |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|ss|nt|Everything I did was ok up until the point that I ruffed my @SK in the dummy. |
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


ls|ss|ls|nh|pc|sk|pc|st|pc|h9|pc|s5|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|ec|hs|sh|at|After that, however, I should have taken the ruffing finesse in clubs (as opposed to ruffing a small club in my hand). Suppose East covers with the @CK (best) and I ruff. |
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|Ec|ls|sh|pc|cj|pc|ck|pc|h2|pc|c6|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


hs|sh|at|The correct play is to continue by cashing the last 2 trumps. |
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


ls|sh|pc|h7|pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|s8|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


pc|h6|hs|wd|ls|wd|hs|wc|nt|West must hold on to 2 clubs to prevent dummy's @C3 from becoming a winner. |
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


ls|wc|ls|nc|hs|wd|at|He must therefore come down to a doubleton diamond. |
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


ls|wd|pc|d7|hs|nc|at|I could then discard the @C3 from the dummy |
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


ls|nc|pc|c3|pc|s9|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


hs|ed|hs|nd|hs|sd|at|and rely on nothing more than the diamond finesse for my contract (which obviously wouldn't have worked on the actual layout). |
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


ls|ed|md|0,dk,,dt|hs|wd|at|If West had been dealt the @DK, he was already squeezed into unguarding it. |
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|nc|hs|nd|ls|wd|ls|sd|up|2|nt|In the line of play just described, you do have to guess what to discard from the dummy on the last round of trump, but in practice your wonderful table presence would often tell you what to do. |
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|nc|hs|ed|at|If not, play East to have to have been dealt 6313. In that case the odds are 4 to 1 that his singleton diamond is not the @DK. |
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


md|0,dt,,dk|at|My line was spectacularly successful, but clearly incorrect :)|
