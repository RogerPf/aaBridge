^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 384 - January 19, 2004^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
As a serious bridge player, you are no doubt familiar with the experience of waking up in the middle of the night (sometimes in a cold sweat) with the realization that you could have made a difficult contract  (for me the cold sweat only comes when I realize I ^*Ishould^*N have made it).

^*BDave Didur^*N, a long time reader of ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N, had this happen to him recently. He was kind enough to share with me the deal that interrupted his sleep. It is presented as a play problem (that ^*Ishould^*N be solved) in this week's deal.

^-
Our prices for the 5 excellent CD-ROMs that we developed with ^*BLarry Cohen^*N and ^*BKit Woolsey^*N have been dropped from $29.95 to $19.95. The cost of these CDs is now in the range of many bridge books. The interactivity, graphics, and that the fact our typical CDs contain several times as much material as a typical bridge book combine to make our software a superior learning medium.

You can find out more about over 20 educational CD-ROMs that were produced by ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N by clicking on the link in the yellow rectangle below. You will be taken to a web page in a new browser window that contains links for the various world class bridge authors (including ^*BLarry Cohen^*N and ^*BKit Woolsey^*N) that we have worked with.

hs|ed|ls|nh|up|40|nt|Now I'm wondering - was Dave Didur the only one who dreamed about this deal? Perhaps East woke up in the middle of the night realizing, not only that Dave could have made his doubled contract, but that East could have left him with no chance. He had to return a diamond (instead of a 2nd club) at trick 2.|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|I hope East didn't lose any sleep over this as a trick 2 diamond return would be awfully hard to find at the table. If he had made this play, there are a lot of interesting things that could have happened, but the defense has an answer to whatever the declarer tries. I am not going to get into the details here, but you can do some research yourself on the next page. |
