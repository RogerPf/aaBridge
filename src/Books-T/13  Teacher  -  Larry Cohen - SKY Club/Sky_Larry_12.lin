mb|pp1h|nt||ht|c|at|And see P P 1@H to you. Should you overcall? |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Even though you are vulnerable, and the hand looks ugly, you should stick in a 1@S bid.|

pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|You never know when partner might be on lead - surely you'd like a spade lead. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|Furthermore, maybe your side can compete effectively for the partscore. |

mb|p4h|at|and RHO jumps to 4@H. |

pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Do you like dummy's bidding? |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|I agree completely with the negative double - a much better description than 2@D. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|In general, a negative double after 1@H (1@S) shows both minors - as here. |

nt||ht|c|at|Now what? |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


at|Surely there are not tricks available in the minors (given declarer's jump to 4@H he must have the @CA and lots of hearts). |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


sk|y|nt||ht|c|at|You do have a chance for a fourth trick. Do you see it? |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


hs|ss|nt||ht|c|at|Play another spade. |

pc|s|ls|ss|at|Yes, this gives a ruff-sluff, |

at|(and play it), you have created a trump trick via an uppercut. The ruff-sluff can't really hurt your side. |
