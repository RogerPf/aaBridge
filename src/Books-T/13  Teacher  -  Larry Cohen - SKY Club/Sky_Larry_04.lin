|fp||at|This is the final deal of the first four of this series (see previous three weeks) where we will be facing a preempt by partner. When your partner preempts, you have an easy decision. If you are interested in game (rare), then bid accordingly. But, if you are ^*Inot^*N interested in game, just raise to the level of your side's number of trumps.
