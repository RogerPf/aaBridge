pg| ***** 3 ***** |


mb|1d|nt||ht|c|at|Partner deals and opens 1@D. |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


mb|1h|at|This is overcalled with 1@H. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|As I commented last week, I love when my opponents overcall 1@H. |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at|It allows me to clarify my spade length.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


hs|ws|mb|d|nt||ht|c|at|Here, I can double to tell partner I have exactly 4 spades. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


ls|ws|ub|1|mb|2h|nt||ht|c|at|There is no rush to bid game |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ub|1|mb|3nt|at|and no rush to bid notrump. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


ub|1|mb|d|nt||ht|c|at|Let's find out if we have a 4-4 spade fit and reassess the situation on the next round of bidding. |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


mb|p2c|nt||ht|c|at|After our double, North passes and partner bids 2@C. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|What does this show?|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Nothing fancy. He has diamonds and clubs and is in the minimum range (no jump). |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|A jump after a negative double is not like a normal forcing-to-game jump shift. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


at|It just shows some extras; if partner had a "medium" hand he could have bid 3@C.|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


mb|p|nt||ht|c|at|South passes  and it is up to you. |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||cq|3|lb|*mYour call is?^2NT~3@H~3@s~3NT^4|nt||ht|c|at|With an opening bid opposite an opening bid, you want to be in game.|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Which game? You already explored for but didn't find a major-suit fit. |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


at|Nobody wants to play 5-of-a-minor unless it is absolutely necessary. |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


mb|3n|hs|wh|nt||ht|c|at|Here, with two heart stoppers and a flattish hand, you should just bid 3NT. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


ls|wh|mb|ppp|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


pc|ht|nt||ht|c|at|West leads the @H10 and you see a frustrating dummy. |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|It is frustrating because no matter how you count your tricks, you have only 8 (my advice is to count losers at suit contracts, winners at notrump contracts).  |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


hs|wheh|nt||ht|c|at|You have 2 heart tricks and can work on any of the 3 side suits. Let's try each one. |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


ls|ehwh|pc|hhh|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


hs|esws|nt||ht|c|at|If you play a spade, you can knock out their @SA to set up 2 spades tricks. |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


ls|esws|hc|dakhaqsqjcak|at|This goes with 2 top tricks in each other suit to produce 8. |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


lc|dakhaqsqjcak|nt||ht|c|at|When they take their @SA, they will clear the hearts and you can't lose the lead again-no good. |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


hs|edwd|nt||ht|c|at|If you play diamonds and they are 3-2, |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


ls|edwd|at|they will win and clear hearts. |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


hc|dak75haqcak|at|You will have set up 4 diamonds tricks to go with 2 clubs and 2 hearts. No good again. |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


lc|dak75haqcak|hs|ecwc|nt||ht|c|at|If you work on clubs, again you have to lose the lead to set up the suit. |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


ls|ecwc|hc|cak9854dakhaq|at|Assuming a 3-2 club break, you have 3 clubs, 2 diamonds and 2 hearts - only 7 tricks. We are going in the wrong direction. |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


lc|cak9854dakhaq|nt||ht|c|at|This is one of the hardest hands (maybe ^*Uthe^*N hardest) you will see in this series. |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|The solution can best be illustrated by looking at all 4 hands. |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


sk|y|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Any surprise? |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


hc|sa|at|The @SA is where you expected it, right? |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


lc|sa|at|Why does it matter? Because, you need the @SA "onside". |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


hc|d2k|nt||ht|c|at|At trick 2, cross to dummy (in diamonds, say)|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


lc|s2k|pc|dddkd|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


hc|s2|at| and play a low spade ^*Iaway^*N from the king. |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


lc|s2|pc|s|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|What can RHO do? |
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


at|If he hops with the ace (on air), |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


pc|sa|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


hs|wses|at|you now have THREE spade tricks. |
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


ls|esws|nt||ht|c|at|This adds to 2 in every suit to get you to 9 tricks. |
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


up|1|nt||ht|c|at|So, he has to duck the @SA. |
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


pc|s|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


at|Now, you have a spade trick in the bank. |
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


pc|sjs|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|That's 1 spade, 2 hearts, 2 clubs |
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


hc|ha|hs|wded|at|and now you still have a heart stopper and can set up the diamonds for 4 tricks |
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


lc|ha|ls|wded|pc|dddd|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


at| - totaling 9. |
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


mc|9|at| Voila! |
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


up|12|lc|dkd2|hc|s5k|nt||ht|c|at|Notice that playing a spade from your hand at trick 2 is no good. |
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


lc|s5k|pc|sssk|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


hc|sa|at|Now, RHO's @SA captures the king (instead of air) and you are a trick short. |
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


lc|sa|pc|sa|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


pc|hk|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|This is the kind of deal that can be worked out with brute logic, but not many players are up to the task at the table.| 
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|You might find that pairs made 3NT when this deal was played, but that is most likely because of misdefense (namely poor discarding). |
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


up|9|nt||ht|c|at|Next week we continue with negative doubles. |
pg| ***** 67 ***** |
