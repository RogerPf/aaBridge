pg| ***** 3 ***** |


mb|p|nt||ht|c|at|In 2nd seat, |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


mb|p|at|you pass|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


mb|2n|at| and LHO opens 2NT (20-21). |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


mb|p|mb|3c|an|Stayman|nt||ht|c|at|After a Stayman auction,  |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


mb|p3nppp|at|you find yourself defending 3NT. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


pc|sj|nt||ht|c|at|Partner leads the @SJ, standard. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|What should your initial thoughts be? |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Count HCP. |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


at|You have 9, partner has at least 1 (the @SJ) and dummy has 6. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|That accounts for 16 HCP. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


at|The 2NT opening showed 20-21. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|This now accounts for 36-37. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


at|This means partner has 3-4 points aside from the @SJ. |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


at|It is a good habit to do this kind of math at trick one when the auction permits. |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


pc|s|nt||ht|c|at|When dummy plays low, |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


at|what should you play? |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


hc|sk|nt||ht|c|at|You should play the @SK. |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


lc|sk|pc|sk|at|It is just possible for partner to have the @SA. |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|If declarer has Qx or Qxx in spades, surely he doesn't deserve a trick. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


pc|sa|nt||ht|c|at|Declarer wins the @SA - so now you know he has AQ.|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


pc|h|nt||ht|c|hc|ht|at|Declarer plays a heart to dummy's 10. |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


pc|hh|lc|ht|at|What is your plan? |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt||cq|1|lb|*mWhat is your plan?^Win 1st heart~Win 2nd heart~Win 3rd heart^2|nt||ht|c|at|On declarer's heart play, partner should signal you his count. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


lc|hakq|at|In "Standard" (although this varies around the world), partner's low card (the @h3) means he started with an odd number of hearts (either 1, 3, or 5). |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Which do you think? |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt||cq|1|lb|*mHow many hearts he has?^ 1 ~ 3 ~ 5 ^2|nt||ht|c|at|It has to be 3. |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


at|If he had 1, declarer would have answered 3@H to the Stayman inquiry. |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


at|If it is 5, there are 14 hearts in the deck-call the director. |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|You want to win your @HA at the exact moment that declarer runs out of hearts in his hand. |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


pc|h9|nt||ht|c|at|So, duck the first heart (@H9 - you are allowed to give count, too). |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt||ht|c|pc|hk|hc|ha|at|Win the next heart. |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


pc|hahh|lc|ha|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


at|And? |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


hs|es|at|Might as well return a spade. |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


ls|es|pc|s6|sk|y|nt||ht|C|at|This is the full deal: |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Declarer can take only 8 tricks (2S, 1H, 3D, 2C). |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Had you won your heart on any other round, the contract would have made. Try it! |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Note: Against good defenders, declarer shouldn't try the 2nd round of hearts. |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


at|He knows they are giving count and he won't be able to sneak through a second round of the suit. |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


at|Instead he should use his only dummy entry to try the diamond finesse, which as it turns out, would lead to the same down one. |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |
