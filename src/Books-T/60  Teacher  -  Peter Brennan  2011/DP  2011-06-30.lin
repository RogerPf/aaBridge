at|Peter Brennan: The purpose of this course is to acquaint you with some useful tools when you declare a hand. Hopefully, by seeing a number of examples in random order you'll recognize these situations when they pop up in your game.  

Each hand features a common challenge of some sort:  dealing with bad suit breaks, handling tricky entry situations, making inferences from the bidding or play, counting enemy distribution and/or points, when to draw trumps, basic end plays, etc.

These hands should be played using IMP or rubber bridge tactics.  Don't even think of risking the contract to make a measly overtrick or two.

nt|This is a very shaky contract.  You can count 2 @ss, 1 @h and, assuming the @d finesse works, 2 @ds.  Since you must run your tricks because the @h will be wide open, you'll need 4 @c tricks to make 3NT.  Good luck!|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|The lesson from this hand is pretty simple - handle your entries with care.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


at|
In hands like this where dummy has very limited entries we should try thinking creatively how to play the key suit to maximize our chances.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


at|
Assuming East has the @dK and the @cQ we may have to be on the board twice.  That could be a problem if @cs are 4 - 1.  Let's say East has @cQxxx.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at| We lead the @c2 to the @cA and lead the @c10 from the table.  If the @cQ doesn't appear we play the @c8 so we can repeat the finesse.  Do you see the problem?|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|Yes, after the 2nd round the lead's in dummy with the @cKJ left in our hand.  We must take another @c finesse to bring in 4 @c tricks, and we haven't taken the @d finesse yet.  Maybe leading the @c8 is better?|

nt|This hand was played by the great New York player Michael Kamil who will represent the U.S. in the Bermuda Bowl later this year.  This hand is from the quarterfinal match of the team trials seen on BBO VuGraph.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


at|
Anxious to begin trump, Kamil won the first trick on the table and led a @h finessing the @hQ.  He was not too surprised by West's void.|

at|
Kamil paused to take stock of the hand.  When an 8-card overcalled suit (@s) is advanced (the partner of the overcaller is the "advancer") usually expect a 5 - 3 split.  East's play of the @s3 on trick 1 implied 3 cards in @s as well.  Everyone OK so far?|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|With 3 @ss and 5 @hs East has 5 cards in the minors.  South realized if East had 3 @ds and 2 @cs he would be the victim of a TRUMP COUP.|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


at|
Any other split of East's minors would make the contract fail. Notice West's discard of the @c6 at trick 2.  Often the first defensive discard is from a 5-card suit and Mike was hoping @cs were 5 - 2 on this hand.|

At the other table in the match, 4 @h undoubled went down 1 so Kamil's team was +590 and +50 for a 12 IMP gain on their way to victory.|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


at|
Here's the lesson text:  Sometimes declarer must picture a particular distribution of defenders' cards and play as if that distribution exists.  Here, at trick 2, Mike Kamil had to hope East was 3 - 5 - 3 - 2 and made 4 @h by means of a TRUMP COUP despite a 5 - 0 @h split. |

pg| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|The first thing to consider is trump.  Both how and when to play them.|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


at|
One way to play @s is to cash the @sA and lead low to the @sQ on the board but that would be wrong with the bidding done by East.|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


at| East bid 3NT over West's preempt and doubled 4@s like a person with @sKJ10 or @sKJ10x.  If he has all 4 @ss, playing the @sA will set up 3 @s tricks for him and down we go.|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


at|
No, the first trump lead should come from the board.  We'll cover East's card .  We don't mind if West can win the first @s trick.  It assures us we'll only lose 2 @ss.  That's the "how."  Next is when to play @s.|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt|The only entry to dummy is in @d and it's too dangerous to lead a @d now.  No problem if @ds are 3 - 3 (36%) but if they split 4 - 2 (49%) East may win the 2nd round of @s and put West in the lead for a @d ruff.  Any questions so far?|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


at|
The only possible entry to West's hand is in @c.  If we give the defense it's @c trick now while East still has a @d we can disrupt their line of communication!|

This modest looking play cuts the defenders off from each other.  East will make his 2 trump tricks to go with the @c trick but that's all.  We've seen this play before in this class.  It's a SCISSORS COUP.|

Here's the lesson text:  The aggressive bidding by East warned declarer of a bad trump split.  To prevent a future @d ruff, he destroyed the defensive line of communications using a SCISSORS COUP at trick 2.|

nt|This hand features a play many experienced bridgers have never seen.  It's called an INTRA-FINESSE.|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


at|
One common type of intra-finesse can be used by declarer in this hand.  Obviously if East has @sKJ10(x) there's nothing we can do.  We'll lose 2 @s tricks and go down.  We must hope @ss are 3 - 2 and the doubleton contains at least one of the missing honors.|

Despite missing the @sKQJ7 you may escape with 1 @s loser if they split 2 - 2 (40%).  That will be a big help because there is a possibility of losing 2 @d tricks as well.  If those suits don't behave can you avoid the loss of 2 @s and 2 @d tricks?  Good luck!|
