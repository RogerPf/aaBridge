^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
He's been mentoring in BIL for 2 years and lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

He learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|

^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

mitche: Hi, everyone and welcome to tonight's 2 over 1 play and discuss session.
2 over 1 means: 
If your partner opens in first or second seat and you bid a non-jump 2 level bid, it is game-forcing.
Also if pard opens 1@H or 1@s in first/second seat, your response of 1NT (with no intervening bid) 
is forcing for 1 round .  Otherwise, the bidding looks a lot like SA

at|mitche: bidding: Even in Standard American, you need 10 points or so to bid at the 2 level
So East's bid of 2@C was an overbid in my opinion
Jane01:  10 with HCP & distribution?
mitche: Her best bid would have been 1NT
9 HCP and 5332 shape is not enough to bid a new suit at the 2 level
Especially without fitting cards in partner's opening suit
Please keep that in mind. It will save you many minus scores|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||at|Next: When West bid 2NT after 2@C, what is her point range?
Since West did NOT open 1NT, her 2NT bid limits her hand to a maximum of 14 HCP.
so now, back to East . She has 9 HCP opposite a partner with at most 14 HCP, so East knows the maximum combined HCP strength of the partnership is 23 -- 
Do you all see why this should be so? 
The key is the fact that W did not bid 1NT to open. So her 2NT is limited to 14|

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: When you are DECLARER, you know about "High card from short hand" to avoid blocking a suit"  yes??
If you were DECLARER, and you were North, you would lead a small heart to the Queen, yes?
On DEFENSE, the same rule applies. It is also MUCH harder to see. 
Why do I mention this?|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: When North led the @HJ, she promises the 10 and probably she has length.
How should S know that N has long hearts?|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


at| 
E-W did not bid them and she has just 2 of them. And so N has at least 4 of them
As DEFENDER, you need to try to picture both of the unseen hands. 
The bidding tells you that N is leading from length.
This all leads South to realize that the @HQ is going to do nothing but block the heart suit
She should (like, she must) play the Q at trick 1.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt||at| mitche: It looks like she is wasting the queen, but it allows N to set up hearts.
Point 3: South can see that N has very few entries, at most one spade entry
So South must make sure that the entry is used only when the heart suit is established
She should hop up on the first spade with her king and lead her (hopefully) small heart|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: That defense assures that NS win 6 tricks instead of 4
Summary: 
a) even as a passed hand, a 2 over 1 bid shows at least 10 HCP  
b) remember "high card from short hand" applies to defenders too, and 
c) when your partner is trying to set up a suit on defense, try to protect her potential entries from being used too soon|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So this innocent - looking hand teaches us 3 very important points, 1 for bidding, 2 for defense
kat827:  Is this a game force here, or is game force only after 1@H and 1@S, unpassed hand, and in 1st and 2nd seats? Could you please clarify when it is game force.
mitche: no - as a passed hand, responder cannot force to game.|

sk||at|mitche: bidding: the 3@D bid is pretty aggressive, but that is the style these days. 
At favorable vulnerability and with 7-3-2-1 shape, the 3@D bid is pretty common. 
Old farts like me may have  different ideas on preempting, but this is OK in the modern style|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: South's hand is not quite good enough to overcall 3@S - You need about 13 working points, and the @DQ is 100% wasted in the S hand
West has nowhere to go, and that brings us to N.. 
I think that at matchpoints, you must double to protect your partner. 
And at IMPS, it's pretty close. |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


nt||at|realrowdy:  What do you mean by protect
mitche: I think the sterile shape argues against bidding (if you think N should double, imagine trading the @D4 and @SK)
3 of either major could be down a bunch.
Bidding over preempts is very difficult..You should have good distribution (or a very strong hand) to balance
A very strong hand is a full opener, by the way

After the 4@H bid, East has a problem. 
A double is primarily takeout-oriented, and East is not at all pleased with the prospect of hearing 5@C from his partner
But West should reopen with a double, which at this level guarantees 4 spades...|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: If West does double, east has to decide whether to declarer or defend. 
I guess to defend because 
a) I do not like the possible club misfit 
b) I have defensive strength, and I may  get a ruff in with my @H2
anniebmisc: wouldn't p take my x as penalty, not reopening? I've gotten in trouble with that before|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: The balancing double says, "do something smart, pard", based on knowing you have spades (the unbid major)
Note that 4@s is an easy make. EW lose 1 heart and 1@D
Oh, please note - bidding 4@S over the balancing X or defending is a tough choice. Preempts work

sk||at|mitche: bidding: What is the range you play for a 1 NT overcall? 
Is it the same as you play for a 1NT opener??
I think that 15-18 is very common, and many SA texts suggest that range.|
pg| ***** 131 ***** |


nt||at|North's hand is: 
a) flat 
b) 18 HCP and most important, has most of its strength in clubs
So I think I would bid 1NT and not double|
pg| ***** 132 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: After the double, S bids 1@H.
She might bid that with zero high card points. 
So 4@H is an overbid - by about 3 levels. At most, if N doubles, then she might raise 1@H to 2
If N did bid 1NT, then S should probably bid 2NT, which N will happily raise to 3...
Or South can pass,, If you play 18 HCP as maximum, then you should have 8 to raise to 2N ,, 
but I kind of like the S hand, which has lots of 10's and 9's|
pg| ***** 133 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So I will stretch a bit. 
But certainly, pass isn't bad, either.
I tend to be aggressive in inviting game and conservatve in accepting invitations
Anyway, if you get to 3NT, you should take 3 spades, 2 hearts, 3 clubs and a diamond

One last point: West should not lead diamonds, but rather, she should exit as safely as possible with black cards|
pg| ***** 146 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: And BTW,, East's play to the first spade lead  was the @SJ. 
When you play third hand, play the smallest of equals. Since both the @S10 and J are equivalent in strength, East wants to play the 10, the lower of them. When E plays the J and it loses to the Q, West should reason that the @S10 is in the S hand

pg| ***** 157 ***** |


nt||mb|p|sk||at|mitche: bidding: OK - welcome to group 3, and thanks to group 2 
Let's start with west's bid of 1@C
She has 16 HCP and can be sure that east will bid 1@H or 1@S  in response to 1@C
She then has an impossible rebid problem
Any rebid lies about something.|
pg| ***** 158 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Her hand is not good enough to reverse, showing 17+ HCP
She can't rebid 2@C because her hand is too good and the clubs not long enough
And any number of NT shows a different point range and should show more than 1 spade
mitche: There are 2 ways for West to solve this problem|
pg| ***** 159 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: 
a) open 1@D and plan to rebid 2@C or
b) open 1NT
I prefer a) - open 1@D
pard will think you have one more @D and one less club
When you make your opening bid, you must think about your rebid, too|
pg| ***** 160 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: I would have bid 4@S over 2@D with the East hand. 
(mm: pard reversed, so promissed another bid..)
She has a pretty good 7 card suit, 2 aces, and her clubs are working well. 
In fact, I would be worried about missing a club slam!
(change the @HK to the @CQ and 6 clubs is almost sure to make)
Dianne0516: wouldn't 4sf slow the bidding?
mitche: I don't know if I would bid 2@H with East's hand. She can never convince pard that she has the spade suit she has.|
pg| ***** 161 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: If E does bid 2@H, W will rebid 3@C. 
Now what? 3@S? maybe. 4@S? I dont know.. 
I think E wants to play 4@S opposite almost any hand W may have
Or 6@C
The only advantage of 2@H is that you can look for a club slam.|
pg| ***** 162 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: let's suppose E bids 2@H and West bids 3@C. 
Now what?
Does east bid 3@S? We are still in Game Forcing auction (4th suit is game forcing, yes?)
West will bid 3N. 
East will have to pull that to 4@C or 4@S, probably 4@C, which should not be Gerber|
pg| ***** 163 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: You see, the auction gets harder. 
I am ol' fashioned enough to bid what I think I can make, and that is 4@S opposite any opening bid.
If West has a suitable hand to go on (spade control, solid clubs), she might move on. 
Notice that 6@C would fail, even if E-W have the @CQ - on a spade ruff!
So I think that whenever 6@C makes, so does 6@S|
pg| ***** 164 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: OK? have we beaten the bidding to death yet?
The important points are West's need to think about a rebid, and whether East would benefit from a 4th suit forcing 2@H
I think a) west opens 1@D and b) East bids 4@S

Here is how she can handle it: 
a) over 1@H bid 1NT, forcing
then b) if pard rebids 2 of either minor, just raise to 3@H. 
If pard bids 2@H, raise to 4  and if pard bids 2@S  get real excited and bid 4@H anyway|
pg| ***** 184 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: I think the slam is a bad one to bid 
It needs much too much good stuff to happen - @CA onside, and spades 3-3 (about a 36% chance)
Also, you make if you find spade J10 doubleton, which happens on about 13% of the 4-2 splits, adding a  2% chance. So the slam is about 19% without South making a double, and close to 38% if South does X
|
pg| ***** 185 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Summary on bidding: 
If you have a 3-card limit raise for a major, start with 1NT and then raise to the 3 level (or 4, when pard rebids 2 of the major)

nt||sk|e|lb|*bPlease choose your bid.^^3c|mb|2Np|sk|w|mb|3nppp|sk||at|Calligal: can I ask if P plays steps?
mitche: sure, but I recommend not to
What should E bid after the strong 2@C?|
pg| ***** 207 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Most people use 2@D as a waiting bid, saying "I cannot make a positive bid"
After 2@S, what then? East looks at her hand and notices no aces or kings. 
She should make a "second negative" bid
The "second negative" is the cheapest minor.|
pg| ***** 208 ***** |


nt||at|In this case, 3@C, but had opener bid 3@C naturally, then the second negative is 3@D
What if you have clubs or diamonds? Well that's too bad.. we will discuss later|
pg| ***** 209 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: But East's 2@H shows 5+ hearts (to the QJ10 or better) and 8+ HCP
It is very positive and suggests the partnership has enough strength to explore for slam
So East should bid 2@D and then 3@C|
pg| ***** 210 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Now, let's ask how W should think about the hand.
West's spades are rather thin. Yes, it's 5 to the KQ, but it's not a great suit.
If W bids 2@S, she should be thinking to rebid NT
So the bidding should be 2@C - 2@D/ 2@S - 3@C/ 3NT|
pg| ***** 211 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: I think that 3@D here is a bad idea, for the reasons we discussed above.
Alternatively, if you play puppet stayman, then West should bid 2NT, not 2@S  
If you don't play puppet stayman, then the auction we showed earlier is the recommended one

nt||at|Dixie_08: what should I lead? @D is only unbid suit
