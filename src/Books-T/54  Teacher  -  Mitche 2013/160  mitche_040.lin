^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Responding to a Major Suit Opening  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|^b@2mitche:    ^*BRaises of opening Major suit Bids^*N
We want to find 8 card or longer major suit fits whenever we can. 
This is our guideline for finding them after opener starts 1@H or 1@S in first or second seat: 

a) Opener bids 1@H or 1@S with 5+ cards in the suit and 2+ quick tricks and between 13-21 total points. 
Responder's first job is to set trumps if she can by raising opener's major and limiting her points.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


at|

b) Responder looks at her support; the first question is: How many cards do you have in opener's suit. 
Responder will have some number of cards in opener's suit, from none to 5 or more.  
I will consider cases where responder has between 2 - 5+ cards.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|

c) ^*UWith a 2 card support^*N, we will always bid our own suit at the 1 or 2 level (if  we can) 
or bid 1NT if we can't bid our suit at the 2 level.
Example 1: Opener starts 1@H and you have   @sQxxx   @hxx  @dAJxx  @cxxx =>  bid 1@S  
Example 2:  @sQxx  @hxx  @dAJx  @cJxxxx =>  bid 1NT over 1@H 
We will know later on if opener has 6+ hearts.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at|

d) ^*UWith a 3 card support^*N, we count our losers using both high cards and losing trick count. 

(1) 0-5 HCP: pass (or bid 1NT with an Ace) 

(2) 7-9 HCP (or 8-9 losers): raise to 2
The raise to the 2-level with a 3-card support and this point range is called a ^*B"constructive"^*n raise. 

(3) 10-12 (8 losers):  start with 1NT (forcing) and then raise to the 3 level.
Example:  @sQJx  @hK10xx  @dAxxx  @cxx. 
Over 1@S, bid 1NT and if opener bids 2 of either minor, raise  to 3@S. 
If opener rebids 2 of her major, then you'ld jump to 4|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

(4) Full opening hand (or at most 7 losers), either make a conventional 3NT call 
(showing 13-15 HCP and 3=3=3=4 or 3=3=4=3 shape) 
or bid your own suit to set a game force.  
Example:  @sQJx  @hAxx  @dxx  @cKQJxx - bid 2@C over 1@H or 1@S.  
Opener's rebid will tell you whether to bid no trump or raise partner's suit.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|  

e) ^*uwith 4 card support^*n

(1) 0-6 HCP jump to 3 of the major. 
This is part of Bergen Raises, but most  people use this even if they don't use the rest of the bids in Bergen 

(2) 7-9 dummy points and 8-9 losers  - bid 3@C (Bergen Raise) 
Example:  @s9865  @hKx  @dKQx  @cxxxx      respond to 1@S with 3C (8 losers)

(3) 10-12 dummy points (7+ to 8 losers) - bid 3@D (Bergen Raise) 
Example:  @sQxxx  @hKx  @dKQx  @cxxxx 
This hand is not good enough to insist on game opposite a minimum 1@S opener.

(4) 12-14 dummy points and a singleton: Splinter. 
Example:  @s10872  @hAQx  @dx   @cKQxxx -  bid 4@D over 1@S 
DO NOT splinter with 15 dummy points. Use Jacoby 2N. 

(5) 13+HCP and not already covered above, use Jacoby 2NT  
Examples:  @s10872  @hAQx  @dQx  @cKQJx  or   @s10872  @hAKx  @dx  @cKQJxx 
(this 6 loser hand is too good to splinter). 
Give partner  @sAKQxx  @hxx  @dxxxx  @cA10, and 6@S is almost a laydown 
(only J9xx offside or a 6-0 club split beats it) 

I suggest that you use both ^*Bregular Bergen raises^*N and ^*bJacoby 2NT^*N as part of your standard set of conventions. 
Also, I suggest some variant of ^*BDrury^*n, which works very well in 2 over 1.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

One more part to the raise structure - the 5 card fit:

f) ^*Uwith 5+ card support^*n 

(1) a singleton, and 0-6 HCP,  raise opener's 1 of a major to 4. 

(2) Raise to 2NT (Jacoby) with 11-12 HCP. Your 5th trump is worth a trick.       
Why would you ever use Jacoby 2NT if you have a forcing raise and also a singleton?|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|  
When you bid 4@C, 4@D or 4@H over openers 1@S you take up a tremendous amount of bidding space.
So when you splinter you are saying that your hand is limited to an absolute maximum of 15 dummy points 
(counting distribution and high card points)
If you have a bigger hand, your splinter makes it harder to search for slam. 
So we agree that splinters are not so strong that opener has to stretch to look for slam|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


at|
  

ecolodge:  Mitch, how does opener know that responder's 1NT is forcing or only 2 of bid suit and 5 HCP or an Ace? 

mitche: Opener does not know. She bids normally. 
If opener rebids 2 of her major and responder is weak, she just passes.  
If opener rebids 2 of a minor, responder will either pass  (with 4 cards in the second suit) 
or correct to 2 of the major...     we don't love it, but we are willing to play 5-2 fits at the 2 level
By the way, 1NT by responder is 100% forcing - in 2 over 1 (by an unpassed hand)|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|

jabwhb: Would you respond 1NT with only 5 pts?

mitche: Yes, I would.. Opener could have 20 points and still open 1@S
The key is the forcing 1NT to show either weak raises (just stay at 2 level) 
or 3-card limit raises (jump raise to 3 level)|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

gypsy1308: If pard opens 1@H and you hold a 3-card @H and a 4-card @S in a game going hand would show your spades?

mitche: If I have a known 4-4 fit, I will stay in it. 
But if I have a choice of 4-4 or 5-3 fit, I generally look for the 4-4 fit.  
So I will bid 1@S over 1@H most of the time  
If I have a ruffing value and 3-card support, I will generally support. 
Example:  @sJxxx  @hKxx  @dxx  @cQJxx is a pretty poor hand and I will just  raise to 2@H.  
But with  @sKQxx  @hQxx  @dxx  @cKxxx I will bid 1@S and over 1NT amd then jump in @H 
This way, pard can evaluate her holding better. 
She will know that @Sxxxx is not a death holding.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|

kat827: With fewer than 5 points? Pass (or bid 1NT with an Ace)  
Can the Ace be in any suit, not just opener's suit?  

mitche: Any suit. Basically, we have to protect pard when she opens 1@S or 1@H with 19-20 points.  
This is why a lot of people like big club systems. 
It isn't when you open 1@C, it is when you open 1@S with 11-15 HCP that you gain if you have to strain 
to keep the bidding open just in case, you will get into trouble when pard has 16-18 points and has to jump to the 3 level to protect you in case you responded with 11 or 12 points...
So the huge 12-21 HCP opening range is a very hard thing for standard or 2 over 1 bidders to cope with

If you like this, we can try again next week with opener's rebids after a raise. 
We will discuss responses to Jacoby 2NT and Bergen, game and slam tries
Ok let's play bridge!

A 2@C bid should show 6 clubs (or a REAL GOOD 5, like AKQ9x).
N started with a minimum opener with clubs.
ecolodge:  ok, my mistake . . . thought it just showed 5 or more and minimal hand. 
mitche: She still had a minimum opener with clubs after 1@S|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt||at|If N passes, then S will reopen with 2NT, showing a hand worth inviting to 3NT. 
North would love to go to 3NT with diamond support and the 5 card suit 
ecolodge:  South would bid 2NT over 1@S?
mitche: Yes - she has 1 1/2 spade stoppers (2 stoppers if spades are led) and a 6 card suit and 11 points
Opener can pass 1@S with as much as 14 points..

Then when East gets in West can clear the suit with clubs as entries. 
If S can win 9 tricks without clubs, then no defense works, 
but trying to set up the spades is the best chance for the defense 
(east will, of course, return a spade when he wins the @DK)|

sk||pc|C6|at|mitche: Bidding: N has 8 HCP and a singleton .. but there are 8 point hands, and then there are 8 POINT HANDS! -
and this is an 8 POINT HAND!
So here is where judgment has to enter the picture... I'd bid 1NT (not 2@S), and then after S bids 2@C or 2@D, I'd bid 3@S
N recognized that her hand was no weakling when she lifted to 4.. 
Should S invite game? Let's see -- S has 6 losers, plus a doubtful club holding - call it 6 1/2 losers. 
The 2@S raise shows about 8-9 losers |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So the Losing Trick Count says you are maybe in the invitational range. 
But (big BUT) S has a flat hand and no aces.  
For game to have a shot, N has to have 2 aces AND some way to absorb that awful club holding
So this is another judgment case -- 
and Mitch's 43'd rule comes to your assistance: 
If you have a hand without any aces or singletons, get conservative!|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt||at|In other words, don't invite on flat  borderline hands. 
This is what makes bridge so maddening --- sometimes the rules just don't work!|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


at|
ecolodge:  Can South bid a minor with only 3 in either suit in response to my 1NT bid? 
mitche: Yes, if you bid 1NT, then opener's 2@S bid promises 6 .. 
2@H guarantees 4, so if N has not got either she pretty much HAS to bid 2 of a minor |
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


at|
BILAsst10: Would south go to game after 3@S by North?
mitche: Yes, if the auction went 1@S - 1NT / 2@C -3@S, she should go on to 4.

pc|DA|at|mitche: Bidding: After 1@C, E has a pretty good hand for a takeout double. 
He has shortness in clubs and support for the other 3 suits. 
Bidding 1@D on a 4-card suit is not often right, and @sKxx is adequate support in spades for a double. 
After the 1@D overcall, S bid 1@S (correctly). |
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


nt||at|Modern treatment is that if you have 7+ HCP, you bid normally after an overcall. 
That plus you have an extra, the negative X
So S has a normal 1-level 1@S bid 
Why not a negative X?|
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: I think that with 5-5, 
S should bid out her hand pattern, because N will not pick a major with only 3 of them
S has a weakish hand, but 5-5 shape compensates for a lot of problems.. :)
If S guessed to bid 3@H after 3@C, N will bid 3NT and make it

sk||at|mitche: Bidding: S has a very nice hand, with 19 HCP in 4th seat, 
I would think about opening 2NT instead of 1@c, it's a white lie, but there is much to recommend it.. 
But in any case, S opened 1@c and heard 1@h from N.|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


nt||at|East's 1@s bid is asking for disaster. 
In this case, 1@s doubled could be set 2 for 500 without much difficulty, and down 3 isn't completely out of the question.
At matchpoints you might be able to get away with 1@s, but at IMPS, you have to have a better suit.
Anyway, what should S do after 1@s? |
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


nt||at|She has 19 HCP still, and she also has 4 hearts and Ace doubleton (in the overcalled suit), 
so she has every reason to think that North's points are not in spades.
She should just bid 4@h and be done with. 
2NT would be OK with a doubleton heart and a weaker hand... 
but this is much too good and has much too good a heart fit for 2NT.

up|36|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: Let's look at the play and especially the defense.
East bid spades with a passing partner and 2 bidding opponents. West should lead a spade, the King.. 
If partner overcalls, unless you have a very good reason to do something else, you should lead the suit she bid.
Very often pard's overall is designed to help you out on opening leads.|
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Next, West must win the first heart, because he wants to preserve partner's entry cards. 
If East has a heart card, it could be used to cash spades, once they're established. 
So 2 defensive lessons: 
first: Unless you have a much better choice, lead partner's overcalled suit.|
pg| ***** 105 ***** |

Second: If your pard bid a suit and declarer still bids NT, you want to make sure to protect her entries to her long suit |

nt||at|mitche: Finally, Letitia played the hand well to make a couple of overtricks :)

sk||at|mitche: Bidding: I think N/S bid the hand pretty well 
2@c established a game force, and it suggested no 4-card major 
(or if south had a 4 card major, she would have 5 clubs), and 2@d is 100% correct after 2@C. 
Since this is a game-forcing auction, S might have bid 2NT at her second turn 
(with 16 point - 15 in high cards, one more for the good club suit)|
pg| ***** 116 ***** |


nt||at|She might allow N to bid either 3NT on a minimum or to make a slam try with the right kind of hand
N will bid 3NT and the end result will be the same 
BILAsst10: In GF contract north could bid 2@h with less than good 16?
mitche: I think that since S denied a 4 card major, N would need a pretty good reason to bid 2@h, 
and this hand isn't quite strong enough or shapely enough for 2@h |
pg| ***** 117 ***** |


nt||at|Bergen insists that in the auction 1@d- 2@c, opener must rebid 2@d 
unless she has both majors stopped. 
So Marty would approve heartily of 2@d
And I, being one of his editors, agree with him, of course.|
pg| ***** 118 ***** |


nt||at|nucks:  Can south bid 2@c with a 4 card major?
mitche: Here, Marty would say S should bid 2@c with 4 hearts and 5 clubs and GF values.
Then S would bid 2@h over 2@d and all would be well again, and furthermore, they got the game force bid in, too.

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Now - on to the play 
W made a nice opening lead, the top of nothing in spades. And East correctly played the 10 at trick 1, 
forcing declarer to play her king.
Now South knows that if West ever regains the lead, the spade suit will be deadly to her.
So WEST is the danger hand
Declarer needs 9 tricks, the spade she already has, and 8 more|
pg| ***** 134 ***** |


nt||at|She has a club and 3 hearts for sure, 
so she needs just 4 diamond tricks to make.
Since declarer needs just 4 diamonds, she can afford to lose one. But she cannot lose it to west.  
Why?|
pg| ***** 135 ***** |


at|
Because the spade queen is worthless if West is on lead.|
pg| ***** 136 ***** |


nt||at|So with that all in mind, how would declarer play diamonds?|
pg| ***** 137 ***** |


at|
Declarer can play a small diamond from hand at trick 2.  
And whatever West plays, declarer covers as cheaply as possible.
If West has @dQJx, then the contract can't ever be made, so declarer shouldn't worry about that layout. 
Play for what you CAN make.|
pg| ***** 138 ***** |


nt||at|Imagine East won the @dJ and shoots a small club through....|
pg| ***** 139 ***** |


at|
Declarer must NOT finesse, for the same reason we already discussed - west is the danger hand

sk||pc|CJ|at|mitche: Bidding: I think that S should bid 1NT over 1@s 
2@c forces the auction to 2NT, and the 3 level is very, very uncomfortable here. 
Also, I think that S should pass 2@d 
Why?|
pg| ***** 151 ***** |


at|
North has almost certainly got 6 of them|
pg| ***** 152 ***** |


nt||at|Here is why:
- She did not bid 1NT over 1@s, so her hand is unbalanced.
- She did not raise hearts, she has at most 3 of them
- She did not rebid spades, she has at most 4 of them. 
With that information - S can work out that N has at most 7 major suit cards, and she did not bid 1N - 
so she hasn't got a doubleton club, either.. hence 6 diamonds.|
pg| ***** 153 ***** |


nt||at|That is what is available info from the bidding. 
But you really have to think about it to realize N almost surely has 6 diamonds
And so N has a minimum opener, and 2NT is inviting game.
In other words, bidding past 2@d is an overbid - the hands do not fit well, 
and N/S have at most 22-23 HCP between them|

South does have 20 and 2 QT's the rule of 20 + 2

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: I think I might try the @sA, rather than the @cJ  
The advantage is you get to see dummy and partner's signal
You can still shift to clubs at trick 2. 
The @sQ doesn't rate to be in dummy, either.. so you still will probably have a tenace position in spades
|
pg| ***** 169 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Next, declarer has to count her tricks, she needs diamonds to be 3-3 to make, 
so she may as well bang down the @dAK and a third diamond as soon as she gets in.
Next week, if you like, we can do another session at the start, this time on opener rebids after a raise.
OK - stay well, keep playing, and enjoy yourselves -- see you next week!
