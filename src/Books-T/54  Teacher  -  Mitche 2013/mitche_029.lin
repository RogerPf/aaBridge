^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||at|


^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

mitche: Hi, everyone and welcome to tonight's 2 over 1 bid, play and discuss session.
2 over 1 means: 
If your partner opens in first or second seat and you bid a non-jump 2 level bid, it is game-forcing.
Also if pard opens 1@H or 1@s in first/second seat, your response of 1NT (with no intervening bid) 
is forcing for 1 round .  Otherwise, the bidding looks a lot like SA|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||at|92612:  Mitch, do you use reverse Bergen with 2/1? 
And do you use Drury?
mitche: I prefer regular Bergen, not reverse. 
Because you need the game invite more over the weaker response
Yes, 2-way reverse, but any Drury agreement is useful

sk||pc|d9|at|mitche: Bidding: the 2@D bid by responder set up a game-forcing auction. N/S are committed to bidding game.
So that means there isn't a reason to use 4th suit forcing.. you are already game-forced
Now, if 3@C is no longer 4SF, what should it be?
You have 2 choices: it's a genuine suit, or it is an ask for a club stopper
You and your partner have to decide which it should be|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: My preference is to use it as an ask, 
since you can bid 2NT to show a stopper in the 4th suit
Remember, 2NT cannot be passed! We decided that with the 2 over 1 2@D bid!
If you really do have the 4th suit, you could show it by bidding and rebidding it, but that is a very unusual auction
Anyway, S decided that 3@C meant "I have clubs"|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt||at|azin: Would 3NT by North unilateral?
mitche: To answer Azin's question, I would have bid 2NT over 2@H because you have a very nice hand 
.. if opener is 6-4 in the majors, you may be able to make 6@S!!|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||at|As to the actual auction: what should S do after 3@C?
He actually bid 3NT, but I think it's better to bid 3@H (promises 5-5 or 6-5 shape)
Responder, North, might have had 3 hearts, in which case 4@H might be better than 3NT
But after the 3NT bid by S, there is no way to find out.
Oh, if S had bid 3@H, then N should bid 3NT, I think

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: OK - on to Play: I want to talk about the @D9 opening lead
There is no way on earth that third seat would ever recognize that as a 4th best lead. 
IF you want to lead the suit, I recommend the @D10, using what are called "coded" jacks, 10's and 9's.  
But I do not like the idea of leading the diamonds at all! Why?
North bid the suit and is likely to have 5 of them.
Second - even if N had just 4, your partner isn't going to have as many as 3 of them|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt||at|Remember that S bid 3NT. 
He would not do that with a void in partner's first bid suit
So partner won't have a diamond to lead to help you cash your suit, even if leading it would establish it for the defense
What I want you to see is that even if you could set up diamonds (very unlikely), you are never going to be able to get in and cash them|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt||at|So you should not lead diamonds
What then?
Leading a major into the suits bid on your right is likely to bury any honor your partner may have; 
Your partner will not be very happy about having a finessable queen picked off by your opening lead
What's left?   Clubs
Lead the @C8|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt||at|Declarer will duck and pard wins the jack, 
He will then shift to something (a small spade) and declarer will have a problem.
What is that problem? 
He will have to be careful to keep communications between his hand and dummy.
Even a heart will give declarer a headache.. 
In fact, a small heart will do just as well as a spade...|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt||at| Later in play, east has to anticipate being thrown in for an endplay, 
so she might discard a club to save an "exit card" - 
Yes, declarer should save dummy's spades

sk||pc|s4|at|mitche: Bidding: Before you all dislocate your elbows patting yourselves on the back.... 
The opening 1@C call was, well, a pretty bad idea.
With that hand, open 2@C and plan to rebid 2NT
That is how you show a balanced hand with 22-24 HCP
Any other bid misrepresents its strength
If you bid your hand accurately, your partner will be able to help you|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt||at| mitche: The auction should be: 2@C – 2@D (waiting)/ 2NT - 3@C(stayman) – 3@D/ 3NT
But you say, "Wait Mitch! they made 6!!! Why shouldn't they be in slam?"
24+7 = 31, right? Without a long suit, you want 33 HCP to bid a NT slam

up|52|pf|y|at|On to the play: What does west know when she leads? 
She knows that S has a monster hand to drive to slam opposite minimum bids by N
So where is the @SA going to be?
In S hand
And probably at least the J, too.  
When W leads a spade, she is hoping that partner has the @SQ
But W also has 10 HCP and the opponents advertise 32 or 33, leaving East with -2 or -3 HCP.... 
So West needs to ask how she can make the lead that is least likely to blow a trick on opening lead|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: is EVERYONE good with the logic we've just gone over? 
West knows that East is completely broke, so an attacking lead from an unsupported honor 
(the @SK) is very, very risky, 
OK - so what should W lead?
Not a spade, not a heart (N bid that suit, so leading it could blow a possible trick with the @H10)|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


nt||at|Leading a diamond will work if declarer has the @DAK, but the one suit where declarer is likely to have no guesses at all is the club suit
So lead a club and let declarer take finesses into your hand. 
You've heard that you should make an attacking lead against 6NT, but don't do it when you KNOW it is likely to blow a trick on defense
I know I'm ranting here, folks, but this is IMPORTANT!|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


nt||at|Now, one other play point. 
Declarer wants to try to score tricks in hearts.
So if the defense wins the SECOND heart, how can declarer get to dummy??
short answer - only in clubs
So declarer should play hearts before using up dummy's only entry outside of hearts
Summary: With best play, declarer is down 1 (or 2), but should not be in slam in the first place
A further point on defense.. East suspects that S has 4 diamonds (remember the bidding)
If they are the AKQJ, then it doesn't matter how East discards.|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


nt||at|But if W has as little as the @DJ, East's @D10 is going to be a winner eventually
So East must ditch anything but diamonds.
You see why?
The clue was the 2@D bid. 
East cannot help stop any other suit, so she has to hang onto diamonds
That way, pard can discard a diamond... 
OK .. enough on this challenging deal! Next!!!

pc|d9|at|mitche: Bidding: after 1@S, what should East bid?
double.
She has a useful card or 2, and 4 cards in the unbid major. 
I think that the negative X here is a bit light (you like to have at least 8 points to force pard to the 2 level)
but I like the hand's Ace and the good club sequence.|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Again - my job is to describe my hand and let partner help figure out what's best
East's hand looks like a negative double, not a pass... so I double with it
kat827:  Wouldn't the negative double, besides the hearts, imply support in diamonds or 4 clubs?
mitche: Yes, the heart suit is pretty shabby, but pard needs to know how many you have, not how good they are
If pard bid 2@D over the negative X, I would pass and take my chances, knowing we have at least a 5-2 fit|
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


nt||at|If he bids 2@C, then I have more of a challenge, but I would solve it by correcting to 2@D
Could I wind up in a 4-2 fit? Maybe
But if pard is 4-4 and too weak to open 1NT, I will pay off... 
And I would also expect to do OK, because the opponents will have a major suit fit, then, that I talked them out of :)
Anyway - neg X seems right|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


nt||at|In the actual auction, W has a bit of a problem - she has a 7 card suit and would hate to sell out to 2@S, but realistically, passing is probably the best choice

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: OK, Have you ever heard the old adage "High card from the short side" for declarers to avoid blocking a suit?
Sure you have! It's in every book on declarer play!!!
Why do I mention that?
Because it works the same way for defenders!
Here is the idea
Declarer decided to play the @DQ at trick 2, covered and ruffed|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


nt||at|The @DJ is now a winner, if declarer can ever get to it
When East won the trump ace, she shifted to the @CQ.
West can play the @CK to get out of East's way
If declarer allows the K to win, West can get off play by leading a diamond while East still has a trump
And then later, the @C9 is an exit to avoid allowing declarer to win a trick with the @DJ|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


nt||at|Play it out! 
You will see that declarer cannot make the contract if W plays the king on the queen
So the first set presented us with some very hard defensive problems -- 
I want you to remember to be on guard against blocking suits or hanging onto a high card that could embarrass you later by allowing you to be endplayed|

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: With the W hand, a spade lead seems right. 
Partner overcalled the suit, and she should have a suit good enough to stand your leading it
Let's put it a different way: if you lead your partner's suit and it doesn't work, well too bad.. but if you don't lead partner's suit and it doesn't work, 
then pard will give you dirty looks and say, something like, 
"I did bid spades, partner.."|
pg| ***** 114 ***** |


nt||at|In this case, leading a spade guarantees that declarer can take at most 10 tricks
Also, imagine that you led a spade and declarer is in dummy. 
If she leads a small heart toward the queen, West can win the Ace and return the suit, setting up a trick in hearts and spades for the defense. Declarer will then cash out
As it turns out, she could have made 11 tricks by setting up the long heart in dummy 
while dummy retained the spade and club winners

sk||pc|d3|at|mitche: Bidding: I guess that doubling 1@C is OK; 
After the double, S bid 1@H - 
Modern practice is to bid as if the doubler had passed when you have about 8 points or so
West has a pretty thin hand with not much distribution, and so 2@D seems a bit aggressive  to me. 
With a 10-loser hand, West might do better to pass...|
pg| ***** 128 ***** |


nt||at|2@S shows extra values. 
With a minimum hand, N can pass. 
Over 3@D, 3NT seems a bit too much for this hand. 
It isn't a horrible bid, but it requires some luck to make .. 
like the clubs to come home and for pard to have an Ace 
(if the clubs are offside, the defense may be able to get in with the @HA and run enough diamonds to beat the contract)
So with the N hand, I might give some consideration to taking high-probability plus score by doubling 3@D

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: In 3@dX N/S will win 1 club, 2 spades, 2 hearts, and 1 or 2 diamonds to collect 100 or 300  (probably 100)

3NT may make, however, with a slightly different approach
At trick 1, declarer needs to play the @DJ
If she doesn't play it at trick 1, she will never win a trick with it|
pg| ***** 143 ***** |


nt||at|If she does win the @DJ at trick 1, she can set up the clubs, bringing the arithmetic up to 8 tricks
Then when the @HA is driven out, declarer loses just 2 diamonds and the club and heart
(she needs not to finesse twice in clubs.. a hard play!)
Anyway, playing the @DJ is essential at trick 1...

sk||pc|s2|at|mitche: Bidding: I rather liked 2@H instead of 1@H because the hand has not got 2 quick tricks. 
Some teachers will tell you not to preempt with 2@H when your hand has a void, 
And if you use disciplined weak 2's, then you should listen to that advice
My spin is to use the Ogust convention to help you find the best spot after a weak 2
Either 1@H or 2 is fine as long as you and your partner have discussed what a 2 bid means to you|
pg| ***** 159 ***** |


nt||at|Fred likes 1@H because of the good support for 2 other suits
gypsy1308: I like 1@H because it meets rule 20
mitche: Again, I have no problem either way, as long as you know what your agreements are
West has a pretty big hand, so he correctly doubled and then bid his good club suit
But when 3@S came rolling around to him, he took the push to 4@C.. |
pg| ***** 160 ***** |


nt||at|It might be a bit unlucky to go down, as W has a 4 loser hand, 
(it actually is 5, because the @HAce is sure to be behind the declarer)
But the warnings are there 
– N/S opened and bid to the 3 level, so East rates to be broke.|
pg| ***** 161 ***** |


nt||at| FM75:  Should N rebid 2@S instead of 2@H?
mitche: I think that I would bid 2@H because: 
N has a 6 card suit, and S could have just 4 spades
I would rather play a 6-1 fit than a 4-3 fit because I can stand a bad split somewhat better
With club shortness, I think N has a good excuse for 3@S, so I like her actions in this auction

up|52|pf|y|at|On to the play: N led a spade 
(I would have led the @HA.. when N had rebid hearts, showing 6, and S didn't raise, 
it's a pretty good bet that S has got at most 1 heart)
Anyway, after the spade lead, West started with a high trump and got the bad news. |
pg| ***** 176 ***** |

mitche: Actually when N got in with the @HAce she should not have led the @SQ, 
but rather to give partner a ruff.|

nt||at|mitche: first - thanks to Eileen for her generous assistance, and to all of you for your active and thoughtful questions. 
Next week will be my last one until the end of August ... 
I am having some surgery to replace my hips (both of 'em, 1 week apart)
And I will be recuperating for most of the month.|
