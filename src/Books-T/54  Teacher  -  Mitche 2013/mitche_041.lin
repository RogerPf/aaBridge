^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. 
My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, 
be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play." 
Mitch Edelman aka mitche 

Mitch:

^*BWelcome^*N to tonight’s 2 over 1 bid, play, and discuss.
I would like to use the first several minutes to continue the lesson we started on major suit raises.  

As you remember, last week, we discussed responder's bids to show support - 
And we left tonight's discussion for what opener should do after a raise.
Now, let's look at opener's actions.


MM: The following is a continuation of last week's short "lecture" on Major suit Responses.

Opener’s first and most important responsibility after a raise is to reevaluate her hand and decide how much 
it’s really worth. 
When responder is able to raise directly (either ...2,3, or 4 of your major, or a Bergen raise, splinter, or Jacoby 2NT) 
opener can frequently place the contract immediately. 
This lesson addresses 2 items -- hand reevaluation and final contract placement. 
The section on evaluation is taken from Marty Bergen’s book, “Slam Bidding Made Easy”.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


at|

^*UYour hand’s initial evaluation:^*N    (starting points)

a) The total of HCP and 
b) Length points,  and
c) Adjust 3 - plus or minus points for ace-heavy or quack-heavy hands, and 
d) Subtractions for quacks in short suits.  (dubious doubletons) |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|

^*BMM: You can find nome's movie "Bergen handevaluation" in the BIL library (new editions) + 
nome's "survival kit" (in BIL Labrary as well, a "quick reference" movie)^*n
or Hondo717's website (where the "viewer" is available for all computers):   
                                              
|cs|1|CP|2|AT|{^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/^*N}|cp|2|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


    
 
lb|*mWhat is this hand worth (Bergen Starting Points)?  
Example 1: @sJ5  @hAK10983  @dK873  @c7^14~13~12^2|nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

Here is the arithmetic:     @sJ5  @hAK10983  @dK873  @c7

a) You have 11 HCP
b) PLUS 2 points for the @h length
c) PLUS 1 point for the good (3 of the top 5 in a 4+ card suit) 
d) PLUS 0 point for what Marty calls “Adjust 3” 
e) MINUS 1 for the unsupported spade jack. 
=> 11 + 2 + 1 + 0 -1 = 13 STARTING points. 

If this seems confusing,  it’ll get easier as you practice it. I recommend dealing hands and evaluating them. 
So you open 1@H on this sound minimum opener.

The ^*Uadjust 3^*N works like this:
Count up the number of Aces and 10's. Then subtract the number of Quacks (Queens and Jack's) in your hand.  
If the number is +3 or more, add 1 point to your hand's value.  
If it's 6 or more, add 2 points.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|
If the count is -3, or less, subtract 1 and if it's -6 or less, subtract 2. 
There is no adjust 3 on this 1st example hand:
2 (Aces and 10's)   -   1 (one J)  =   +1   => no adjust|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|

We use this (system) because in the 4-3-2-1 point count system, Aces and 10's are undervalued.   
And Quacks are overvalued 
If you have more Quacks than undervalued Aces and 10's, your point count is inflated, 
and you need to discount the point count.. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


LB|*mExample 2:   @sAKQ10  @hA73  @dA1095  @c84  What is this hand’s starting value?^18~20~19^3|nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

It's 19 - here's how     @sAKQ10  @hA73  @dA1095  @c84
Ans:  17HCP + 1 for quality spade suit + 1 for adjust 3 = 19 points.

To calculate Adjust 3 on example 2: 
You have 3 Aces + 2 10's (5) and 1 Q so the total is 5 - 1 = 4 
When the total is between 3-5, add 1 point;  If the total is between 6-8, add 2. 
If it's 9 or more, you probably are opening a strong 2@C or maybe 2NT....|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|

You are too good to open just 1NT, so open 1@d in first/second seat, 1@s in third/4th seat.  
If you positively refuse to open this hand 1@S in third seat, you are losing out.
Which suit do you want led, spades or diamonds? |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


at|
A 4 card suit with 100% honors is good enough to treat like a  5-bagger!

Keep at it, because you will need it for the second part of the lesson 

^*BRe-evaluation after a raise:^*N 

If pard raises your opening bid of 1@H or 1@S, you are likely to declare the hand 
(assuming your side buys the contract, of course). 
Here are Bergen’s  guidelines for calculating your hand’s strength after a raise: |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|

a) Start with initial evaluation (= starting points)
b) If you have 2 doubletons, add 1 point (don’t add anything for just one doubleton)
c) Add 2 points for a singleton
d) Add 4 points for a void.
e) Add 1 point for the each trump over 5 (1 point for 6 card suit, 2 for 7-card suit, etc)
f) Add 1 point for an outside 4 card suit. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

Going back to example 1   ( @SJ5  @hAK10983  @DK873  @c7)   
Partner raised your opening bid of 1@H to 2@H.        What is your hand worth now?|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


at|
Dixie_08:  Is this declarer pts after finding trump fit?
mitche:  yes
OK - answer time -- is it 16, 17, 18, or 19? |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


at|
|LB|*mClick your answer?^16~17~18~19^2|at|
a) 13 starting points (11 HCP - 1 for @sJx + 2 (@h length) + 1 (quality @h suit)  )
+b) 0 for 1 doubleton 
+c) 2 for the singleton club 
+d) 0 points for voids 
+e) 1 point for 6th trump 
+f) 1 point for the outside 4 card @D suit.

So we get 17 
So what do we do with our hand now???|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


at|
Pard’s raise to 2@H showed 7-9 dummy points. 
Another way to look at this -- your opening hand is worth 6 losers, 
and pard promises 8 or 9 losers for her raise. 
If she has 8 losers, you expect to have a good play for game.  Invite game. 
You can use science to ask if partner has help in diamonds (we will discuss this next week).|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


at|

The important point here -- after evaluation, we come up with 2 different ways to look at partnership strength
17 + 7 to 9 = 24 to 26 total points OR 6 losers plus 8-9 losers for the single raise = 14 - 15 losing trick count.
Subtracting combined LTC of 14 or 15 from 18 gives us 3 or 4. 
So we are between being at the 3@H or 4@H level, and opener doesn't know which.|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2 

So what do you do when you don’t know what to do? |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


at|
You ask your partner, which in bridge language means "INVITE".

realrowdy:  Does this take LOTT into account?
mitche:  The LOTT is kind of moot here, since we have 9 trumps and the question is only how many losers we have. 
More properly, how many losers responder has.|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


at|

sebstar:  Does it work the same if bid is 1@H - 1@S - 2@S, now that opener is dummy?
mitche:  Well, it kind of works the same way when opener raises. The "limited" hand's partner is in charge... 
When you raise pard's suit as in 1@D – 1@S/ 2@S, you, the opener, say you have a minimum opener, 
(at most 15 points) and probably around 7-8 losers..
You could have a bad hand w/ 6 losers and still raise to 2... 
But the point is - once a pard limits her hand - the other pard is in charge, 
and either places the contract or asks for more information.|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


at|

If partner (responder) raised 1 of your major to 2, she has 8-9 losers (7-9 HCP)
If your opening bid has 7+ losers, pass (or fewer than 16 Bergen points after reevaluation)
If you have 6 losers, invite game
With 4-5 losers, bid game.
|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


at|
If partner used a Bergen raise of 3@C (showing 7-9 dummy points and 8-9 losers), 
you have the advantage of knowing you have a 9 card fit, worth 1 extra trick. So:|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


at|

With 7 losers, sign off in 3 of your agreed major
With 6 losers and a 5 card suit, invite
With 6 losers and a 6 card suit, bid game
With 4 or fewer losers, explore for slam.|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


at| 

When partner bids 3@D (10-12 dummy points), she should have 7-8 losers, 
so just subtract 1 loser from each of the actions listed above. |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2 

Partner’s jump raise to 3 of your major is preemptive showing 0-6 HCP and probably 9 -10 losers. 
For you to bid game after a raise to 3@S over 1@S, for example, you should have a  hand with no more than 5 losers.

See the LTC handout for more info.

MM: Mitch will mail it to you upon request:  mitchedel@ggmail.com 
with "BBO LESSON" as subject 
mitche: Let me know if you want the lesson on raises, LTC, or both.

^*BResponding to Jacoby 2NT^*N

When partner makes a forcing raise to game, you are going to be interested in slam if your hand is either
above minimum strength in high cards or if it’s very shapely.|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


at|

Basically the responses are to 2NT are:  

Unbalanced hands:
(a) Bidding 3 of a new suit shows ^*ushortness^*N, either a singleton or void
(b) Bidding 4 of a new suit shows a ^*usecond 5 card suit^*n
(c) Bidding 4 of the agreed major shows a dead ^*uminimum^*n hand  (13-15 declarer points)

Balanced hands:
(d) Rebidding 3NT shows a balanced 5332 hand with 14-15 HCP (*)
(e) Rebidding 3 of your major shows a balanced hand with at least 16 HCP (**)|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


at|
Next week, we will explore bidding after a forcing 1NT or when responder makes a delayed raise.

^*bMM: Please check nome's Jacoby 2NT movie (or "survival kit"-version) in the BIL library^*n
or on Howard's site again.
(*) (medium 15-18 declarer points)
(**) (maximum hand: 18+ declarer points, or very good 17 + 6-card suit)

We use the Rule of 22 (Total of HCP + quick tricks and 2 longest suits).  
Here N's hand gets to 21 
In third seat, then opening is OK, but not in first seat, and especially not in second. 
Next - S correctly bid 1@S, raised by North.  East doubled, which was takeout.
What should West do?|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt||at|sebstar: convert to penalty by passing?
mitche:  One thought is to bid 2NT, having spades well stopped.  Another is to pass.  
Passing is taking a pretty deep position.  
If you remember our discussion of the rule of 12 and 10, you see that W has just enough trump strength to pass. 
(mm:  Check mitch-movies 26 and 38 (hand 1)

|cs|1|CP|2|AT|{^*Hwww.bridgehands.com/R/Rule_of_12.htm^*N}
|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  I personally would not double with E hand, because - 
a) S still is unlimited and 
b) East's hand is pretty weak, having only 1 trick on defense and not very good texture in the heart  suit.
If you double in a "live" auction, you want to have better suit quality.  
At matchpoints, you can get away with a bit less, but at IMPs or total points or (especially) money bridge, 
you need to have more in your suits than East's hand has.|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |

Note that  2@S will either just make or go down 1, depending on how the defense proceeds.

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche:  Play:  After the expected @S lead, E does best to play @CA and a second club, with the intention of setting up the suit before trumps are removed from dummy.
By pulling trumps, declarer is betting on a 3-3 division, a less than 50-50 proposition.  
Better to try to play the hand on cross-ruff lines.

sk||at|mitche: Bidding:  I think that East's hand should open 1NT - it is flat, with 16 HCP
Unless you play weak 1NT, the hand is about as close to a "book" 1NT as you are likely to be dealt.
I would not object to a 1@D overcall of 1@C, nor do I feel that S should overcall. 
On balance, I think you gain more than you lose to overcall at the 1 level when you can do so.|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


nt||at|btour: So I would get maybe 5 tricks if we play strong 1NT...
mitche: btour, it is not that you make 5 or 6 tricks at 1NT.. 
It is that you describe your hand accurately to your partner. 
It's possible that she had the hand that north was dealt, and if you bid 1NT, you'd get to your ice-contract 
or your ice cold 3NT contract.
When you bid 1@C with a strong 1NT, you can never catch up. Any bid will be a misdescription of your strength, and you either go overboard or undercook the contract.|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


nt||at|btour:  we play WEAK NT. If I get a chance to bid again I bid 1NT and announce 15 -17
mitche: You are playing standard here, with 15-17 1NT. 
Do not expect your partner to figure out what your're up to. 
And if you're playing with an established partnership, I ask that you stick to conventional bidding systems.
Better, I recommend playing with other than your set partnerships.  
You’re here ostensibly to learn 2 over 1, and playing with your set partner will not assist you in learning it.|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Now, on to the balancing double. 
If we knew that E/W were playing weak 1NT, we would pass 1@C and let declarer struggle in his 3-3 fit
With A@H lead and continuation, E/W will take 4 tricks, perhaps 5.|

sk||at|mitche: Bidding: West's got a bit of a problem over 1@S...
she would like to act, but the 2 reasonable actions (double or 1NT) have flaws.
So she decides to wait. 
East decides to balance with 2@H and S rebids 2@S, a very reasonable thing to do.  
Now, 3@H seems like an underbid to me. 
If East has any kind of hand worth a 2@H bid, W can bid more strongly than a simple raise.|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


nt|I would bid 3@C if the understanding is that it shows tolerance for hearts. 
I think it should be forcing, too, since W would not bid to the 3 level on a misfit.
Here is the idea:  West did not overcall 2@C, so she doesn't have a very long club suit, right?
The second idea is "if you are on a misfit, get out as quickly as you can".  
So, if W bids 3@C without a long suit, she pretty much guarantees that the hand is not a misfit.|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


nt|So why should she bid this strange bid rather than raise hearts?
West has a hand too good for a simple 3@H raise, which is just competing.  
And she isn’t quite good enough (3 dead spades and good, but not great clubs) to bid 4.  
So she improvises with 3@C, which says, "I have a better than competitive raise. 
And also, look at your club holding to decide if we belong in game.  
East will then know better whether to bid 3@H or 4.. With bad clubs, he should just bid 3@H.|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


nt|Think of the 3@C as sort of a long suit game try.
btour:  How would I evaluate with Qx in clubs?
mitche: If pard has a long, broken club suit, the Qx should fill it out for 1 loser.. 
then if you have bad cards in the pointy suits you settle for 3@H|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Now, the 3@s bid was pushing things, I think. 
S bid 2@S after pard passed, which shows a good hand.
Once you bid 2@S and pard still isn't interested, it might be time to pack it in and just let the other guys, E/W, play. 
When you bid 3@S, you are saying your hand is really good.
You would need the @dQ or @CQ to make that bid, in addition to everything else 
If you had either of those cards, you would be justified to bid 3@S.. 
And if you did, then N would be justified in doubling.|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


nt|Cliff228: How many Bergen pts does south have?
mitche:  S has 17 Bergen points. 
Remember, she doesn't know if N/S have a fit. 
And she cannot count distribution until she finds out that she does... 
Anyway, S bid her hand's value with 2@S, so 3 was pushing it..
Cliff228: I figured my ptnr for 19
mitche: Cliff, you have every reason to play her for one more good card than she has. |

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche:  Play: Cashing the spades was correct 
- but I think the best chance for the defense is for S to continue with a third high spade. 
She wants to protect her partner's long trump suit, not to make her ruff and shorten them
mitche: ok, people - 2 over 1 , strong no trump openings, and standard carding, please.

sk||at|mitche: Bidding: Most people play that if you overcall 1NT, then you use the same conventions 
(transfers, Stayman) as if you OPENED 1NT - This is called "Systems on".   
So if you use 4-way transfers, then the 2NT is a transfer to 3@D - if not, it's invitational.  
If it is invitational, S surely has enough to go to 3.. So 3NT is where N/S belong. |

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche:  Play: Now, how should declarer play the hand?
mitche: At NT, you count winners. N/S start with 1 heart and 3 clubs and 1 spade for sure. 
So where are the tricks coming from?
Note that N/S have the @D KQJ10 and 4 of them in dummy. After the @DA is knocked out, N/S have 3 diamonds. 
That brings the arithmetic up to 8 winners, yes?
She needs 1 more trick, and with the spade AQJ, she is sure of 2 spades.|
pg| ***** 127 ***** |


nt|mitche: Declarer needs to get her winners in before she allows the defense to set up winners of their own. 
So here is the line I recommend:
Play 3 rounds of diamonds - Immediately.
East will win the third one and return another to establish the @D9
But S doesn't care, because she still has control of the other suits.
She will win the @D in dummy and before doing anything else, she will lead the @SQ.|
pg| ***** 128 ***** |


nt|mitche: She doesn't care whether the finesse wins or loses, because she will win 2 spades, 
which brings her total number of winners to 9. 
She can repeat the spade hook to guarantee 10 tricks.

sk||at|mitche: Bidding: First - with East's hand, you may want to bid 1@C - 
after all, E has 5 hearts and 6 clubs
Washington standard, as played by Hall of Fame member Steve Robinson advocates opening this hand 1@H. 
Why? You are more interested in hearts than clubs.  
You would need a hand with extra values (say the @CKQ) to bid clubs first and then bid hearts twice. |
pg| ***** 137 ***** |


nt|sebstar: So you mean "you may want to bid clubs, but don't"?
mitche: The idea is to bid where your MOST PROBABLE game is. 
So with a minimum opening bid and 5 cards in a major, 6 weak cards in a minor, 
open the major perhaps 1 time in 50, you will stop in 4 of your major when 6 of your minor makes. 
But the other 49 times you come out at worst even, and probably better, 
because the defenders won’t learn about your giraffe (6-5 hand).|
pg| ***** 138 ***** |


nt|mitche: After 1@H, S has a monster! 
I think it is right for her to double and then bid spades.
That shows a very good hand, too good for a simple overcall
Putting it differently, S would have a comfortable 1@S overcall without either of the minor suit aces,
So she has to show her strength by doubling and then bidding her suit.  |

up|44|pf|y|at|mitche:  Play:  N/S can take 12 tricks - but bidding slam is very, very difficult. 
Here is how declarer should think about the hand. She has 1 or 2@s losers, depending on how they divide.
She has no losers in hearts, 2 possible losers in diamonds, and 1 possible club loser.  
Declarer has an uneven number of clubs (an extra club in hand), and East bid clubs. 
This suggests that she can finesse in clubs.|
pg| ***** 152 ***** |


nt||at|She can finesse 2 times in the club suit, and when they win, she can discard not a heart, 
but a diamond from dummy.  
Now, declarer can ruff 2 diamonds in dummy. Voila! 12 tricks.|
pg| ***** 153 ***** |


nt|In NO TRUMPS, you count winners and look to develop more. 
In suit contracts, count losers and plan to eliminate extra losers by setting up side suits 
or possibly forcing the opponents to help you.
Cliff228: If easts opens 1@H, south X, west 3@H, where does the bidding go?
mitche: South would have bid 4 spades no matter whether East bids 4@H or passes.
Mike Lawrence's rule applies:  "If you have a choice of several bids and one of them is 4@S, bid 4@S"|

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche:  Play: Declarer expects to win 2 @h's, 2 @D's and 5 @c's, assuming they split. 
She can see 4 top spades and can win 3 of them, too, so there are 12 tricks available to them if clubs behave.
So declarer should play as follows: 
Win the first heart in her hand with the Ace, and then play a couple of rounds of clubs. 
They split 2- 2.    Now, the spade queen. 
S will play small (good, Kat, not to cover!)|
pg| ***** 176 ***** |


nt||at|Now, declarer crosses to dummy with a club 
(this also unblocks the suit!!).
She cashes the spade ace and plays the jack. 
If S wins the spade, declarer still has entries to dummy in both clubs and hearts to cash the now-winning @S10|
pg| ***** 177 ***** |


nt||at|The lesson for this hand (and the predecessor) is  
- count your winners and look for extras. 
This hand also has a second and third important lesson 
- to unblock and to preserve entries in the hand that may need them.
