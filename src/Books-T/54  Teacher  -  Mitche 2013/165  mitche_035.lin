^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||at|


^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

mitche: Hi, everyone and welcome to tonight's 2 over 1 bid, play and discuss session.
2 over 1 means: 
If your partner opens in first or second seat and you bid a non-jump 2 level bid, it is game-forcing.
Also if pard opens 1@H or 1@s in first/second seat, your response of 1NT (with no intervening bid) 
is forcing for 1 round .  Otherwise, the bidding looks a lot like SA|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||at|92612:  Mitch, do you use reverse Bergen with 2/1? And do you use Drury?
mitche: I prefer regular Bergen, not reverse because you need the game invite more over the weaker response
Yes, 2-way reverse, but any Drury agreement is useful. 
There are very few GF auctions: 
1@S- 2@C, or 1@S-2@D, or  1@S – 2@H or  1@H - 2@C, or  1@H - 2@D or  1@D – 2@C

sk||pc|h3|at|mitche: Bidding: The bid of 1NT as an OPENING bid is usually 15-17 HCP, 
but  what is the range for an OVERCALL of 1NT?|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|  
well, 15-18
msphola:  What if Margo doubled and corrected?
mitche: S would not like to bid 2NT if N were to bid 2@C over the double - that could be on 4 clubs and 0 HCP.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: A double followed by a NT bid should be 18-19 (a GOOD 18)
If she had doubled and bid NT over 2@C, that would work out OK, 
But here, given the extreme concentration of strength in hearts, I think most people will bid 1NT, rather than X
I do not like the idea of a takeout X when I have strength in RHO's suit|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: But if S did double (let us say), and N bid 1@S, S should bid just 2@S, which shows this strength 
(but not this shape :( )
If S decides to get optimistic about her hand (with 2 10's and the working @DJ), she might decide to risk hearing 2@C over the X...  
Then the 2NT bid would show the 18 - 19 point hand
It's close. The reason I bid 1NT instead of doubling is the hearts . I want to get my hand in with 1 bid..|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: I guess the point of this deal is to show that sometimes, 
there just aren't really clear-cut bids...

altak38:  mud (middle-up-down)
mitche: Play: When W drops the @SJ under the K, S guessed to play West for the doubleton QJ -- 
And if by chance East has the Q, he will be end played later, as we saw.
It turns out that 4@S also makes, even if S misguesses spades....|

So had N doubled 1NT here, it would have been takeout of spades
OK. When N bids 2@H, she limits her hand to about 17 HCP. 
Since here, her hand is a bit better than that (worth 18 in high cards, and a very good 18 at that), 
I think it best to double 1NT and then bid 2@H
Pard might have something like xxx, Q10x, Jxxx, Qx and 4@H becomes a favorite to make|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Suppose E passes a balancing X of 1@S - 
South doesn't have a good enough hand to pass and convert to penalty
So S should bid 2@D, I think. 
The hand will be horrible for NT when E/W take the first 4 spades and lead a diamond...|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: This brings me back to the 2@H overcall... 
It was kind of unlucky that the @H suit  has no "texture", i.e. high spot cards
When you overcall on a suit like this, you are hoping for some good stuff to happen - like a good split or some support.
You would like a better suit to bid it at the 2 level with unfavorable vul. 
This is another reason for a takeout X...|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Although you are still going to bid 2@H over either 2@C or 2@D.. :)
BTW, would anyone have bid in the West seat after 2@H pass, pass?|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


at|
Cliff228: Could say 2@S  showing two
mitche: Just wondering.. with a 7-loser hand and @SQx, I probably would have bid 2@S|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt||at|btour:  I have run into people who do not play the double there as take out and they get very mad
So with unknown pard I think my pard's bid was reasonable
mitche: Standard bidding: Had N doubled instead of bidding 2@H, it would be 100% takeout|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt||at|msphola:  We play DONT over a 1NT,  for example
mitche: The ONLY TIME you play DONT is over an OPENING NT, and NOT over a 1NT RESPONSE!!!!
btour:  We play it regularly with some success
mitche: Here's the thing, folks- you may bid anything you wish (within some limits, as set by ACBL), but the more non-standard you get, the more you're asking for trouble. 
BILAsst10: and you end up alerting and explaining all your bids|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: I recommend that as most of you are intermediates, you stick to standard conventions (I will list a few of them afterwards, if you like), until you have mastered them - then start tinkering...

up|44|pf|y|at|mitche: Now, on to play: W properly played the @S3 (do NOT signal doubleton with Qx) 
At least not in low-level contracts!
And East shifted to the @DJ, and W (again properly) played an encouraging 9
N won, cashed a couple of clubs, and led a third one. She ruffed with the 10; 
I think that she should play for a 4-3 club split (much more likely than 5-2) and ruff small.|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: If W overruffs the 4, it is from length. 
In point of fact, if W does overruff with the @HQ, it may be his natural trump trick, so Sol decided to ditch the @SQ instead
What happens if W overruffs and leads @D's is that it will promote a trump trick for the defense, which wins 3 trumps, 2 diamonds and a spade, I think, to beat the contract
In West's seat, it's pretty tough to see that defense, but he might reason that the @DJ was from shortness, and if he does, then getting in to cash diamonds may be the best line. 
OK - please allow me off my soap box and onto the next deal

pc|dt|at|mitche: Bidding: If you don't play Flannery, a 1@S bid, followed by a raise of hearts 
(either to the 3 -or 4-level) will describe this hand
If N had bid 1@S, 4@D would be very reasonable.. but N bid 1NT
BILAsst10: But why bid 1NT with 4 @S's - that is denying a 4-card @S
mitche: What should S rebid?|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: S has a hand with just 4 losers, assuming a fit in any of her 3 suits.
So she might rebid 3@C instead of a modest 2@C
Her hand is going to be a monster!
After 3@C, which I treat as GF here (jump-shift) N bids 3@H (show support first)
Now S bids 3@S, looking for slam.. |
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: If N had a bad hand with heart support (3 cards) she would bid 4@H over 3@C 
(fast arrival), assuming that 3@C is game forcing
If 3@C is just a 1 round force in your system, then N would need to jump to 4 to show a good hand
Since 1@H – 1NT/ 2@C can be on as many as 17 points, I treat 3@C as being worth 18 and up, hence GF after 1NT|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: NOTE TO THE ESTABLISHED PARTNERSHIPS: 
Modern bidding will jumpshift on as few as 16 points and a good 2-suiter. 
Discuss with your pard what the minimum hand is for a jumpshift, and what is forcing after it
So you MUST decide if for instance 1@H - 1NT/ 3@C – 3@D is weak or strong.. 
I just like 3@C to be game forcing here. Sometimes, you get nailed when responder has 6 bad diamonds and out, but ...|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Oh, wait. 
Note that if N does bid 1@S, S should bid 4@D to show a game raise and @D shortness. 
N/S should still not get to slam (it is a fair slam, having about a 60% chance to make), but it's a good start

She has 2 club losers, 1 possible spade, one or more hearts. 
So she should plan to ruff her club loser in dummy. 
Then she can afford 2 heart losers  and still make the contract|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: I think on a @D lead, I would play as safely as possible by discarding a @C on the @DA, 
then 3 rounds of clubs, ruffing, 
then a heart king and a heart to the jack. 
This protects against a 4-1 split with E holding the 4 
If W holds the four hearts, you just lose 2 hearts and a spade

pc|ha|at|mitche: Bidding: Earlier we saw that 1@H 1NT (overcall) shows 15-18 HCP (remember??)
What about a BALANCING 1NT, as in 1@H, pass, pass, 1NT?
What does that show???|
pg| ***** 102 ***** |


at|
In standard bidding, that balancing 1NT = 11 (or a good 10) to 14 HCP
So the balancing 1NT should be "almost an opening hand"
or 10-12 points and something that passes for a heart stop|
pg| ***** 103 ***** |


nt||at|(mm:"Standard bidding with SAYC-Pomer and Downey: Balancing seat 1NT = 12-14 (about a 3 point overbid) )
mitche: Pretty plainly, a balancing 1NT may not have stops in all suits.
So W should balance with 1NT, and E should pass. Then E/W would stop at a safe place
But now, here's another problem for you: what does 1@H (pass) 2@S mean to you?|
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Most players treat it as weak, showing about 6 points and 6 spades (and the points concentrated in spades!)
I am just asking, because I think that the S hand is not even good enough for the weak jump bid
But if the auction were 1@H pass, pass, 1NT / pass, pass, then I would bid 2@S on S hand..
The vulnerability is another consideration..|
pg| ***** 105 ***** |


nt||at| 
Anyway.. our E/W got to 2NT.. If W had pulled 1@S to 1NT, I would not have bid 2@C, by the way
After the double, you have no choice but to bid 1@S, but after 1NT, its best to call it a day -- 
you have a balanced hand and not a lot or points. 
Pard cannot have more  than 12, so with a maximum of 21 HCP and no good fit, just call it quits|
pg| ***** 106 ***** |


nt||at|kat827:  What is the Soloway jump shift that the robots play sometimes? 
Is it a strong jump shift by responder (robot) meaning 17+, so if S were to bid 2@S
could one think it might be that?
mitche: Yes, ^*BSoloway jump shifts^*n are "game or slam in your suit, my suit, or NT"
But not the rock-crusher 19 HCP jumpshift of Goren days.. 
Also Soloway js could be other types of hands.

After the defense of a heart and diamond shift, W should win the @D in hand and take an immediate club finesse
That will give them 4 clubs as the cards are placed, 3 diamonds, and either a heart or spade, 
depending on how the defense plays the hand

sk||pc|ca|at|mitche: Bidding: I wonder if X by north is a good idea. 
Pard could not scrape up a third-seat opening of any kind, so  double is kinda odd. 
If I bid at all (with unfavorable vul I might not), I'd consider 2@C but not X
dragonfy:  I bid 2@C then thought it was wrong with 4 @S's and @C
masse24: But if you bid 2@C first then undo so you can Double....you more or less Promise 4-5 in the Blacks! 
A much more descriptive bid!!   :))|
pg| ***** 133 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: E/W allowed themselves to get talked out of 4@H... 
East/West may not have any tools to show a good heart raise after the double.
calligal: I knew I could bid 3 having 4 of the trump but was fearful of 6 pts, plus 3 for shortage in @c
rattray:  The dbl made me think again|
pg| ***** 134 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Some pairs use a variation on Bergen raises after 
1@H X , where 2@D shows 4 card support and 7-9 dummy points
West has a pretty good hand (after @H support, it's 6 losers), 
but that isn't quite good enough to jump to game given this auction 
(2@H could be a 9 loser hand)
Oh - question - how many of you know anything about "losing trick count"?|
pg| ***** 135 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: That will be next week's lesson!!!
msphola:  Read the series in the bridge bulletin
EddyHaskel: LTC: count up my losers then add one for my lousy play
mitche: Anyway - back to the hand.. I think the bidding might go p, p, p, 1@H/2@C 2@H 4@C
and then W would have to think hard whether to bid 4@H or pass or X|
pg| ***** 136 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: I would hope to beat 4@C 2 tricks and double.. 
but with 11 card fit, N/S can hope for down 1.. 
And with 4@H making - down 1 would be very good. 
The problem is the duplicated values in diamonds and wasted heart QJ. 
If either N or S held a singleton, then 4@C is just off 1 trick..

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: - I think that at trick 1, S should play her LOWEST club, not the 9.
Why?
Plainly, a second club lead is going to get ruffed. 
dee_dee_20: I didn't want a switch 
dragonfy:  I took the high @C to mean a switch to the highest suit not bid
mitche: So she should suggest strength in diamonds, the lower-ranking suit.|
pg| ***** 151 ***** |


nt||at|This is one situation where your first play is not count, or attitude. 
You cannot want clubs continued, and so you can provide partner with some help on what to shift to. 
If you want a high suit (spades), play a high card. 
A low card should suggest the lower non-trump suit, diamonds, 
and a  middle spot says "no preference" do what you think is best.|

^b@2mitche: What say we look at some useful conventions?
In other words - how to fill out the convention card - or at least part of it

The boxes I want to concentrate on are the ones in the section "major opening"
We know that in 1st or second seat, we promise 5 card majors. 
I recommend that you allow yourselves to open a STRONG 4 card major (with 3 of top 4 honors) in 3rd or 4th seat, 
But that isn't really essential.. Just a suggestion. 
In any event, the EXPECTED length is 5

Responses: modern style is to use "constructive raises", where 1@H – 2@H shows 3 card support and 7-9 dummy points
I also recommend that you use 1@S – 3@S (double raise) as WEAK 
(showing 5 or fewer points, 4 card support, AND some ruffing values)
So we like to check off weak. 
And after a double: a 1-level bid is 1 round force, and a 2 level overcall is weak.|

I recommend these conventions: Jacoby 2N, Jordan 2N, splinter bids. 

I like ^*BBergen raises^*n, but I also like to have some understandings about them
Here is how Marty originally proposed them:|
pg| ***** 155 ***** |


at|
If the opponents are passing and you are an UNPASSED HAND, then 1@S (or 1@H) - 3@C shows: 
4 card support and 7-9 dummy points. 
Example: 1@S - 3@C on:  @sQ10xx  @hxx  @dAxx  @cQJxx
The bid says absolutely nothing about your club holding.|
pg| ***** 156 ***** |


at|
And 1@S - 3@D shows 10-12 dummy points and 4 card support, exactly 
example: 1@S - 3@D =  @sxxxx  @hAJ10x  @dJx  @cKQxx|
pg| ***** 157 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|

^b@2Notice that the bid of 3@C or 3@D promises 4 card support, says nothing about trump quality, or the suit bid
In Marty's original book, he used 1@S - 3@H or 1@H - 3@S to show an undisclosed singleton (splinter), 
but I think no one uses that now

bizarro:  How about 3NT in Bergen?  Some use that to show 13 to 15 HCP and exactly 3 trumps.|
pg| ***** 158 ***** |


at|
mitche: I have not discussed that, yes.. it should be 13-15 with 2344 shape, having doubleton support for opener's major
bizarro: oh doubleton not three
mitche: Some use it that way, also, and I have a small preference for using it to show xx rather than xxx. 
But I am not really wedded to that.
Again - discuss with pard.. I recommend not bidding 3NT over 1@H with Hxx 
But again, that is up to your partnership agreements.
If you use Bergen, you pretty much also need to use Drury|
pg| ***** 159 ***** |


at|

^*BDrury^*n works like this: 
You passed in first/second seat, pard opens 1@H or 1@S in third seat 
(some also play you use drury on 4th seat openers)
Here is the problem you are facing: 
You have 10+ /-12 support points for pard - If he has a full opener, 
he may have game opposite your hand... 
but if he opened very light in 3d seat,  the 3-level may be too much.|
pg| ***** 160 ***** |


at|

Since 2 over 1 is not game-forcing after you pass... 
Drury uses 2@C and 2@D to show 3 and 4 card support with 10-12 dummy points. 
2@C to show 3+ support

Example: pass, pass, 1@S pass
You have:  @sAxxx  @hKJx  @dxx  @cQJxx
You'd like to be in game opposite a full opener. 
So you bid ^*u2@D^*N to show 4 card support and 10+ /- 12 point support.|
pg| ***** 161 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|

^b@2If pard has a subminimum opener, he just returns to 2@S 
Any other bid is forcing 1 round, and asks responder to clarify his hand.|
pg| ***** 162 ***** |


at|

Some people play this (rather complicated) treatment of Drury:

After the Drury 2@C or 2@D, opener rebids 2NT as an artificial asking bid
Responder bids the Cheapest Suit that he would accept a game try with.
Example:
pass   pass   1@H   pass
2@D    pass   2NT(*alert*)
Opener wants to know your cheapest "good holding". 
Example:  @sxx  @hKQxx  @dAxxx  @cQxx
You rebid 3@D to say: "I would accept a game try in diamonds, but not in clubs"
That is Drury|
pg| ***** 163 ***** |


at|

^*BJordan 2NT^*n   

Suppose your partner opens 1@H or 1@S in first /second seat, and your RHO ^*udoubles^*n. 
A jump to 2NT by an UNPASSED responder says, "I have 4 card support and ^*uat least 10+^*n dummy points"
In other words, the Jordan 2NT shows the kind of hand you'd bid a Bergen 3@D on without the double
Note that Bergen raises are OFF over anything except pass.|
pg| ***** 164 ***** |


at| 
If you play Jordan, then there is an inference that: 
1@H (X) XX (redouble) shows strength but not very good support for opener's major
After an overcall 1@H/1@S (2@C) Jordan is off.
A 2NT bid would be natural, invitational, and promise about 11-12 points and club stopper

Also, you need to discuss very carefully what a free bid (new suit at 2 level after an overcall) shows|
pg| ***** 165 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|

^b@2(mm: I think many play Jordan even with a PASSED hand
pass   pass   1@H   X
2NT = Jordan = limit raise.  (You just wont have the "or better" part)
Also: Some promise good 3-card support, others 4, be it a passed hand or not...=> discuss
Jordan 2NT also known as "Truscott 2NT" and "Dormer 2NT")

EddyHaskel: With 10+ and four support you just cue bid after an ^*bovercall^*n?
mitche: Yes, most people play an immediate cue bid as limit raise or better - but you cannot cue bid a notrump... :)
Oh, yeah, we already discussed what double of a NT overcall means. 
1@S  (1NT)  X means "we got 'em, pard" I have 10 points, the hand belongs to us, 
and do not let them off the hook!"|

OK.. I need to get to bed soon. Physical therapy at 9, and my expert (?) duplicate session tomorrow afternoon
The hips are hoppin' along. By this time next month, I will be ready to enroll in Arthur Murray 
Please feel free to mail any questions to me. I will be changing my email address to mitchedel@ggmail.com

dragonfy:  The conventions you gave, is that all you suggest we learn  or play
mitche: I recommend you also learn 4th suit forcing and new minor forcing.. 
OK, folks. Thanks to Eileen for her generous assistance and to all of you for your patience and your participation! 





This concludes this presentation, I hope you enjoyed, Karen10  |
