^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||at|


^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

mitche: Hi, everyone and welcome to tonight's 2 over 1 play and discuss session.
2 over 1 means: 
If your partner opens in first or second seat and you bid a non-jump 2 level bid, it is game-forcing.
Also if pard opens 1@H or 1@s in first/second seat, your response of 1NT (with no intervening bid) 
is forcing for 1 round .  Otherwise, the bidding looks a lot like SA|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||at|92612:  Mitch, do you use reverse Bergen with 2/1? 
And do you use Drury?
mitche: I prefer regular Bergen, not reverse. 
Because you need the game invite more over the weaker response
Yes, 2-way reverse, but any Drury agreement is useful

sk||pc|sa|at|mitche: Bidding: There are a couple of points I think are worth discussion
First: When N bid 1NT, she probably denied having as many as 3 spades.
So when S bid 2@s over 2@h, it invited a disaster.|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||at|Second point, East's double was takeout for the round suits. This is a common way to play the bid; 
It shows a decent hand (11 or 12 point minimum) and a hand not suitable for a takeout X of 1@D
South may have done better to double 2@H instead of bidding 2@S
If partner has a decent heart suit, she can convert the double to penalties, bid 2NT or 3 of a minor, as appropriate|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Here, she would have bid 2NT, I think
The balancing double says, "I want to compete further, but I don't have a clear-cut bid
azin: should East bid 3@H as he was not sure of 9 heart fit?
mitche: I would have bid 3@H because his hand is pretty good, and he has spade shortness.  
He won't win many matchpoints for defending 2@S

up|40|pf|y|at|mitche: OK - on to play: Note that 2@S makes, even with the 4-2 trump split.
After the 2@S bid, N's opening lead of the @SA seems correct.
At trick 3, S played a small diamond (correct), and North covered the 9 with the Q
It is correct here to play the lowest card that you can to cover the 9.
That would be the @DJ|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: When N plays the @DQ, her partner will think that West has the 9, 10, and Jack, 
It is a very central point in defense. 
As DEFENDER, you want to play the lowest of "equivalent winners" to help partner place honors
As DECLARER, you can make a deceptive play by playing the HIGHEST of equivalent "honors"|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: One more point,  
West saw the A, J, 10, and K of spades played on the first 2 rounds of the suit
That meant her @SQ and @S9 were both winners, and she should be happy just to play trumps and lose just the @HA and 2 spades, and a diamond at the end.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: (she could try for a squeeze for 10 tricks, but that is rather unlikely to work)
So the key points  - 
(1) North would have bid 2@S over 2@H with 3+, so S knows N has at most 2 spades
(2) Play the LOWEST of equivalent winners as defender to help partner know where cards are

pc|dj|sk||at|mitche: Bidding: A lot of 2 over 1 players play what is known as "Walsh style"
Briefly, this means that responder will skip over a 4 (or occasionally 5) card @D suit to show a 4 card major
I guess that N was not playing Walsh style and S was.
Had they had a chance to discuss it, they would have known whether N or S should have bid 1@S
So that was just an unfortunate bit of confusion|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: next: 2@C by E was a pretty good idea. 
It shows a good club suit and about 10 points minimum, the same kind of hand that would make a 2 level overcall
Now we come to the balancing double.
It cannot promise clubs, so it is an "optional" double
Should S convert the double to penalty?|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


at|
Well, yes, she should.|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt||at|
N/S allow they have 2 hearts, 2 clubs, and declarer has no place to park 2 losing diamonds if the defense can arrange to play some trumps early
So the contract should go down 1 (at least)

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: On to the play: What should S lead?
In my mind, it's not even close. The  @DJ seems completely correct, and pretty unlucky
That lead doesn't give up anything
But when declarer plays a third diamond to ruff, S should not discard a heart.  
Better is to ditch a spade...

pc|c5|at|mitche: Bidding: Marty Bergen has a saying that some of you have heard - "five, five, come alive"
Here, S has a 5/5 hand with 10 HCP and 2 pretty decent suits
I think that opening 1@D is going to be a winning bid most of the time. 
This would have been one of them|
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: After 1@H opener in third seat, many players use "Drury", 
so 2@D would have been a conventional heart raise
Playing reverse Drury means that OPENER shows a bad hand by rebidding 2 of her major after the Drury 2@C or 2@D bid
(not that south hàs a Drury)|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


nt||at|After N's bid of 2@D, since S has such a good hand for diamonds, 
I think she could have bid 4@D, not 3
So I think S underbid a bit here
After 4@D, N would happily bid 5
If S opened 1@D, the auction might go: 1@D - 1@H/2@C- 3@D (North has a big, big hand), and S would then bid 5@D

Pard will probably bid 3NT anyway, and you have 10 sure tricks

When pard preempts vulnerable, his suit is pretty good - so do not try to improve things|

analisals: didn't understand what my response to double was?
mitche: If East doubled 3@D, you have 4333 shape and a likely @D stopper and an opening hand. Bid 3NT
If you pass 3@D, you might beat it 2 tricks, which is not enough to compensate you for a vulnerable game
It turns out you beat 3@D a lot, but it's reasonable to think that declarer can take 7 tricks with his vulnerable 3@D bid|

nt||at|mitche: At trick 2, I think I'd have continued clubs anyway, because nothing else looks good. 
Hearts might work, but I do not like the idea of taking a heart finesse for declarer
When East plays a heart to the ace, N correctly ditched the @HK
West now decided to play another club, which seems reasonable 
When declarer ruffs, she should wonder "how am I going to avoid losing 3 spades, a trump, maybe 2, and the 2 aces I already lost?|
pg| ***** 133 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Anyone have a hunch what declarer could try? 
kritter2:  needed to try to throw losers on heart
mitche: Play a heart to dummy and run as many hearts as you can. discarding spades
If someone ruffs, you hope it is from trump length, but in any case, even if it's from shortness, all you did was exchange a spade loser for a trump loser, and you break even...|
pg| ***** 134 ***** |


nt||at| mitche: As declarer, you need to cultivate the habit of asking how many losers you have and how you can get rid of extra losers...

nt||at|mitche: A minimum 2 over 1 overcall shows about 11 - 16 HCP and a decent 5 card suit or longer
kritter2:  then East can raise spades over my 2 diamonds
mitche: But as it happened, N did pass, and now we come to East.|
pg| ***** 142 ***** |


nt||at|If you like Bergen, you would bid 3@S with this hand
Bergen raises say, a jump raise to 3 of a major shows 4 card support, 0-6 HCP, and some distribution
But even if you don't use Bergen raises, you must bid 2@S, because you have a hand worth about 6 or 7 dummy points|
pg| ***** 143 ***** |


nt||at|analisals: do I pass then even though they say: "come alive"?
mitche: the "come alive" is 5-5, come alive.
Here, the reason for a raise is - you know you have at least a 9 card fit, 
and you know the opponents can get in with something..most likely a minor 
And you will want to support spades.|
pg| ***** 144 ***** |


nt||at| So by bidding before the opponents get to exchange information, you put pressure on them 
to come in at the 3 level or go quietly
If East had bid 3@S, you should bid 4.|
pg| ***** 145 ***** |


nt||at| Anyway, back to the bidding.. after 1@S, pass, pass, 
S has to do something. North is marked with some points because East is too weak to move... 
And I would double 1@S. 
If West passes (she wont), your pard will bid some number of diamonds. 
You can make 3 diamonds, unless West gives east a club ruff|

nt||at|mitche: a 2@C balancing bid is not terrible, but the double is OK ... 
Here is the idea behind a balancing double.
The weaker you are, the more you should balance, because your partner will have more - 
Remember that one hand is broke
Balancing is a difficult part of the game. I recommend Mike Lawrence's book on balancing. 
It is very, very good and very clear and easy to read|

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play:mitche: how should W proceed to play?
After winning the heart and playing a couple of rounds of trumps, she should try to set up clubs. 
If west wins the @CA, she should ruff low clubs in dummy and not waste the jack and 10|

fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f "Walsh Style"  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|^b@2Mitch: 

There was one area we mentioned - "misunderstandings" -- 
I would like to do a quick discussion of "walsh style", because even if you don't play it, you will encounter it
If you can, look at deal 2 in the movies
You may remember that N/S missed a 4/4 spade fit

The N hand had 4-3-5-1 shape and after partner opened 1@C, she responded 1@D
North's hand was Kxxx, KJx, K10xxx, x
Walsh style works like this:
Opener starts with 1@C
Responder has a 4 card major and 4 or 5 diamonds
If responder's hand is less than game-forcing, i.e if responder has less than a minimum opening bid, then she bids the major and bypasses the diamond suit

Example 1: Responder has Kxxx, Kxx, Q10xx, xx
Opener bids 1@C
In Standard American, you bid 1@D (bid suits up the line)
But playing Walsh style, you have just 1 bid, in essence, and that is 1@S

Example 2: Jxxx, AQx, KQxxx, x
You have 12 HCP and if opener in first seat has anything resembling a sound minimum opener, you expect to have some shot at game
So you respond 1@D (your 5 card suit). 
Opener will still think you don't have a 4 card major. Right?
Because if you were weak with a 4 card major, you would have bid it

^*BSo opener will not show her own 4 card major unless her hand is unbalanced^*N.|

nt||cp|2|at|

^b@2 
She will bid 1NT on a balanced minimum
So the bidding goes 1@C – 1@D / 1NT
Now, when you come out of the woods and bid 2@S
a) opener knows you are getting to game
b) she also knows you have 4 spades and 4 or more diamondsYes, it is a reverse by responder. 
But it also makes it easier to know if you belong in game
What do you do as responder, if with the first hand 
Kxxx, KJx, K10xxx, x, opener rebids @H?

You know, playing Walsh style, that opener has a distributional (or really strong hand)
So you raise to 2@H on your 3 card suit

There are ways opener can ask if you  have 3 or 4 card support, but that's too much stuff for this evening.. 
Anyway, because opener is distributional to bid 1@H over 1@D, 
your raise rates to work better more often that bidding 1@S will. 

OK - one more point on Walsh style: 
When the auction goes 1@C – 1@S/ 1NT - you cannot bid 2@D to show your diamonds. 
That is New Minor Forcing
You just pass 1NT 
With a weak hand, that is

OK, that is it for this evening. Thank you for your courteous attention, and thanks to Eileen for her generous assistance



I hope you enjoyed this presentation, Karen10|
