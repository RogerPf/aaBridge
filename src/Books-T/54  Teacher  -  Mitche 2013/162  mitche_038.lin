^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |

^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

mitche: Hi, everyone and welcome to tonight's 2 over 1 bid, play and discuss session.
2 over 1 means: 
If your partner opens in first or second seat and you bid a non-jump 2 level bid, it is game-forcing.
Also if pard opens 1@H or 1@s in first/second seat, your response of 1NT (with no intervening bid) 
is forcing for 1 round .  Otherwise, the bidding looks a lot like SA|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||at|Kib:  Mitch, do you use reverse Bergen with 2/1? And do you use Drury?
mitche: I prefer regular Bergen, not reverse because you need the game invite more over the weaker response
Yes, 2-way reverse, but any Drury agreement is useful. 
There are very few 2/1 GF auctions: 
1@S- 2@C, or 1@S-2@D, or  1@S – 2@H or  1@H - 2@C, or  1@H - 2@D or  1@D – 2@C (and Jac2NT of course)

sk||pc|ca|at|mitche: Bidding: I think that a preemptive jump overcall shows a 1-suited hand. 
So I would not bid 3@H with the east cards, but either 2@S (michaels) or 2@H, 
planning to bid @D's at the next chance.. 
Notice that all East needs for 4@H to roll is 2 small hearts in dummy and the @DK, or any black ace|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So do not preempt yourself out of a game. 
A Michaels cue bid shows two suits: If you overcall 1@S with 2@S, 
it says "hearts and a minor" (there's a bit more than that, but that's the main idea)
Next: North's double is primarily takeout, and S may convert - but she needs better hearts.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: You recall the rule of 10 and 12: 
Subtract the level (9 tricks) from 12, and you need at least that many trumps to convert a takeout double to penalty. 
AND subtract the number of trump tricks you have from 10. 
If that number is at least as large as the level then you may pass the takeout X.|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||at|
S has enough trumps (12-9= 3), but she has no sure trump tricks and needs at least 1. So she should not pass. 
With a solid 6 card club suit, she might consider 5 clubs. (6 may make with careful play)

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Now, on to play: 
East should play a couple of rounds of diamonds before she touches trumps. Then she can make the contract.
Also, N should cash the @DK before playing a low spade .. 
that makes it very clear to S that she should return a diamond.
BILAsst10: North might have something to say about that - unlucky distribution for declarer
mitche: Eileen, the defense will tap declarer each time it gets in, so declarer needs the @D suit to neutralize 
the bad trump split. Deal out the cards to see why...

at|
calligal: pts needed for game/slam
mitche: right.. 26 for game in a major or NT, 29 for game in a minor, 33 for small slam, 37 for grand
So if an opening bid promises 13 points, and I have 20 HCP, I would be very interested in bidding to a slam
Let see where E/W missed the boat.|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: 1@S, 2@h are fine      I think 3@C is OK by East. 
Now, West, who has a monster hand might bid 6 clubs directly over 3@C, but that is way too conservative.
She should make another forcing bid either 3@D or (much better) 4@C 
After 4@C, East should bid 4@S, which should show the @SA
West will then bid 4NT, East 5@S (2 key cards and the trump Queen)
Now it's very hard not to get to 7, which fails only because of a wretched 4-1 trump division. 
Or E/W may decide to bid 6NT

South must play the @DK, because if W has the @DAQ the King is dead anyway, but if N has the @DQ, 
it sets up a trick for the defense
Turns out that W can always make 13 tricks at NT as the cards lie - 
the @HQ and 10 come down, giving declarer 6 hearts, 3 spades, 3 clubs, and the @DA

pc|sq|at|mitche: Bidding: In third seat, I would think about bidding 1@D on the N hand. 
It meets the rule of 22, and it may give E a bit of a problem
East will, of course, double 1@D, but the bid will help N/S with the defense... 
Anyway, when N passes, the rest of the bidding was just what I would expect. 
E opens, W bids 1@H and passes 2.|
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: After E/W stop in 2@H, S should think about a balancing double.
(MM: ummm south not in balancing seat, north is) 
mitche: Here is the idea of balancing.. 
E/W have found a fit and stopped at the 2 level. 
That means they have at most 22 points and an 8 card fit.. 
We have at least 18 HCP and if they have  a fit, so do we. 
So we can't get hurt very badly if we find our fit.|
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


nt||at|Also, note that if N/S bid to 3@D, East may very well bid 3@H, 
which is a much riskier contract than 2
Notice that 3@D may, in fact, make exactly 3, losing 1 trick in each suit.
East has a nice hand.... so she might not stop
West bids 1@H..with 4-4 in the majors, bid "up the line"..  bidding 1@S by west loses the heart suit

If responder bids 2@H over 1@S, it 100% absolutely positively guarantees at least 5 of them.
OK. Remember it. This does not apply just to 2 over 1, but to SA, too - and precision... 
So East doesn't want to bid 2@H|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: She has a spade raise,
But she cannot bid 2 (her hand is too good)
She should bid 2@D (which might be a 4 card suit)
And then after pard bids 2 of anything, she bids spades 
In this respect, SA and 2 over 1 are a lot alike, (but the 2@D bid requires a full opening bid in 2 over 1)
East has 13 support points for spades, so 2@D is OK..|

It's my only chance to win a trick with it. The @C10 is either top of nothing or from KJ10.. And  most people would sooner swallow cod liver oil than to lead from KJ10 in a side suit 
But it's the only chance to score 2 clubs|
pg| ***** 107 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Also, declarer has to figure out how not to lose 2 clubs in hand. 
If the @CQ gets covered with the K, then declarer should try to ruff a club in dummy
Final, notice the heart suit.
Whichever side leads the suit first blows a trick.
This is an example of a frozen suit.
Declarer should try his best to get the defenders to lead hearts, and he might do that by leading diamonds|
pg| ***** 108 ***** |


nt||at|So I think the play might be like this: 
club 10, queen, king, ace, and at trick 2 declarer plays another club
The defense does best to shift to a trump (good defense, South!!!)
Declarer ruffs a club, plays the @SK and leads a LOW DIAMOND from dummy
South, who is not privileged to peek, will suspect something is up, but unless she is very suspicious, 
she may climb with the king... 
(declarer could be trying to steal a trick with the jack)|

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: With 4 to an honor, it is usually correct to lead small, so N should track the @C3, not the King
This might help S and prevent her from misdefending... 
Let's turn to declarer's problems for a moment. 
In addition to the 2 club losers, he must lose 2 spades and is at risk of losing a third spade and a diamond.
That is too many losers|
pg| ***** 132 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Therefore, he should try to use the diamond suit to discover how to play the trumps. 
If he ruffs the club (at trick 3) in dummy, he must return to hand with a heart and finesse in diamonds. 
If the finesse wins, he can afford 3 trump losers. 
But if the diamond finesse loses, he must hope to hold his trump losers to 2|
pg| ***** 133 ***** |


nt||at|The trumps might be divided 2-2, but if the @D finesse loses, 
he should win a second heart in hand (or maybe the second diamond.) and run the @S10. 
If it loses to a singleton jack, well, too bad. 
But playing the @SQ is the worst way to handle the trump suit, since it loses whenever the jack is tripleton
and it wins only if the jack is singleton
The jack is 3 times more likely to be tripleton than singleton|
pg| ***** 134 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Here is the point: 
Declarer should count his losers and if he has more than he can afford, he must look for a play to reduce 
the number of losers
And on defense -- the first ruff and sluff made some sense (North's club play suggested a doubleton), 
but the second ruff-sluff allowed declarer to get away with no @D losers.
So a heart was required. If it picks off a finessable honor in North's hand, well the honor was finessable anyway.

sk||pc|h6|at|mitche: Bidding: Earlier, we suggested that a preemptive jumpshift should be on a 1-suited hand. 
It still should be.. 
If I were south, I would bid 1@H, not 3
If E/W decide to defend, 3@H will probably fail by 2 tricks. 
Declarer won't be allowed to ruff a club at all, so she loses a trump, a spade, and 3 clubs for sure... 
and possibly 2 trumps..|
pg| ***** 142 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: If you have length in the suit bid on your right, I recommend taking things easy. 
You will frequently do better defending.
Should West bid 3@S? 
I think that it's the right bid. The 5-0 trump split was really, really unlucky.|
pg| ***** 143 ***** |


nt||at|sebstar: one question on bidding 
- was 4@S a good idea?
mitche: Yes. 4@S was a good idea. Honor doubleton is usually enough support here, 
and 3NT from East is an impossible bid.
As it happens, 3NT is very lucky make, but it really is impossible to bid

up|44|pf|y|at|mitche: Next point in play: 
Remember the old rule about how to avoid blocking a suit? 
It is "high card from short side"
Once declarer got in (after a couple of defensive ruffs) he played off the @SK. 
Better to play to the jack first, so she could return to hand and finish pulling trumps|

^b@2mitche: Here is the situation where Michaels cue bids come in handy:

We all know about takeout doubles. 
Your RHO bids a suit, you have an opening hand and support for the other 3 suits. 
You double, and pard picks her best suit.|
pg| ***** 159 ***** |


at|

But sometimes you are dealt two 5 card suits ... double with 2 suits is usually a bad idea.
If the 2 suits are the lowest 2 unbid suits (e.g. you have hearts and clubs, and RHO opened 1@D) 
you might use the "unusual no trump" bid of 2NT to convey your desire to play in one of those suits

OK - Michaels cue bids are first cousin to unusual NT.
If opener starts with 1@C or 1@D, then an immediate cue bid of 2@C or 2@D promises 5-5 distribution in the MAJORS
Example: 
RHO opens 1@C and you hold  @KQ10xx  @QJxxx  @dxx  @cx 
Bid 2@C
Some people will not bid 2@C here at unfavorable vulnerability, but I am a believer in getting my bid in earlier, 
rather than later...|
pg| ***** 160 ***** |


at| 

OK - Next: If your RHO opens 1@H or 1@S, a Michaels cue bid shows the other major and a (unspecified) minor
Example: 
You have  @sAJxxxx  @hx  @dKJxxx @cx and RHO opens 1@H.     Your bid is 2@H

I will get around to discussing how to find out which minor shortly
So we are clear, then, on what the Michaels cue bidder is saying when she makes a michaels cue bid
|
pg| ***** 161 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|

^b@2If advancer has no tolerance for the major that the Michaels bidder has shown (and she promised a minor),
then the advancer (partner of the overcaller) bids ^*U2NT^*n conventionally ...
Asking the Michaels bidder to bid her minor.

So with the earlier example, if the auction were 1@H   2H   pass 
and advancer wants to play in the overcaller's minor, she bids 2NT

Overcaller alerts (2NT is alertable), explains that 2NT asks for opener's second suit, and then she bids it. 
In our case, that would be 3@D

You can make things a LOT more complicated, but I recommend not to - not for a while, anyway|
pg| ***** 162 ***** |


at|

Now, point count:
I think that a reasonable approach to Michaels is to start off playing them to show some point count range
Like 6-12, and with more power, the overcaller plans to bid both of her suits.

This way, if opener on your right bids 1@H and you have  @sKQJxx  @hKx  @dx  @cAQJ10x, 
all you really need for a play at 4@S is for advancer to have 3 spades to the Ace 
(and with @SAxx and the @CK, 4@S is almost 100% cold)

So instead of a Michaels bid, you would overcall 1@H with 1@S and plan to bid clubs later, 
unless pard raises spades aggressively, in which case, you'd just blast off!

sebstar: I presume michaels is forcing bid (p cannot pass) and alertable?
mitche: Yes, and no.  All cue bids are "self-alerting", and pard is expected to pick one of your suits. 
But since people will occasionally open 1@C on 3 of them, advancer might pass 2@C 
with  @sxx  @hxx  @dxx  @cKQ10xxxx or the like.

^b@2
In fact, I had that happen to me not all that long ago.  
Pard had exactly that hand and passed 2@C. 
I got to declare with a void in trumps. 
We went down 1, which earned us 5 1/2 out of 7 matchpoints when both majors broke really badly 
and people playing in their 5-2 fit had to ruff early |
pg| ***** 164 ***** |


at|

OK - so one last point. 
If your pard makes a Michaels call, you are expected to bid to the Law of Total Tricks' safe level 
as soon as possible. 
Example: 
Your hand is  @sJxxx  @hxxx  @dxx  @cKxxx    Your LHO opens 1@H and your pard bids 2@H.  RHO passes 
You should bid 3@S, not 2, and you must not pass with a probable 9+ card spade fit
If you're doubled, you may be set 2 or 3 tricks, but the opps are very likely to be making game in hearts,
if not a slam.|
