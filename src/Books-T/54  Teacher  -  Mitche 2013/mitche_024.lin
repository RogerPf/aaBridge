^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |

^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

mitche: Hi, everyone and welcome to tonight's 2 over 1 play and discuss session.
2 over 1 means: 
If your partner opens in first or second seat and you bid a non-jump 2 level bid, it is game-forcing.
Also if pard opens 1@H or 1@s in first/second seat, your response of 1NT (with no intervening bid) 
is forcing for 1 round .  Otherwise, the bidding looks a lot like SA|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||at|92612:  Mitch, do you use reverse Bergen with 2/1? 
And do you use Drury?
mitche: I prefer regular Bergen, not reverse. 
Because you need the game invite more over the weaker response
Yes, 2-way reverse, but any Drury agreement is useful

sk|n|lb|*bPlease choose your bid.^^2s|mb|4s|at|note movie maker: Though North's correct rebid was not discussed:
3@s = 100% solid in a 6+ card and strong hand: AKQJxx(x)
4@s = solid too, (6+) though no s/v, minimal and no slam interest.
As there is no 4-card to bid, and 2NT would show stoppers in ALL unbid suits
2@s is the "default" bid.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||mb|ppp|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


sk||pc|h4|at|mitche: Bidding: First - with this shape, S would prefer to bid 2@C not 2@D  .. why??
2@C allows opener to bid either @D or @H naturally.. 
If opener has @S and @C, the 2@D bid makes it hard to locate the club fit....
(yes, 1@S – 2@H promises 5 hearts by responder)
But 2@C may be on a 4 card suit.. 
Anyway .. After 2@D, N decided to blast off to 4@S|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: You don't want to do this for 3 reasons:
First - your hand is balanced (indeed, some people might open it 1NT)
4@S says 6 or more spades 
Second: 4@S makes it hard to explore for slam, if one is available, because the responder's bid is unlimited
South could have 20 points, and he'd still bid 2@C (well, he should have)
Third, it may be that NT would be a better contract than spades.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt||at|dianavd:  tell us when N would closeout to 4@S - what would hand look like?
mitche: Playing 2 over 1, there is no reason to bid 4@S once pard forces to game.. 
since responder is unlimited, you want to leave room to look for slam or the best game
As a matter of style, some people will always bid 1NT with 5332 shape, even if the 5 card suit is spades
You can make a case for opening either 1@S or 1NT, 
My preference is 1NT, especially if you play puppet stayman|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Anyway, a 4@S bid should show a pretty specific hand - 6+ spades, no singletons/voids, and a minimum hand.
As suggested, fast arrival - but here, it says, "unless you're really loaded, pard we want to play 4@S"
Let me just say again -- there is almost no reason to jump to game as opener after a 2 over 1 response.

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: OK - on to Play: At trick 1, E led the @H4, which seems a good start for the defense.
When S played small from dummy, West played the J.. 
This is a technical error. Notice that the @H10 is in dummy, so the J and 9 are equivalent. 
The 9 will force out the @HQ from declarer
And third hand should play that card, the @H9.
Third hand high means the lowest of equivalent high cards ... 
After that, declarer has 5 spades, 4 hearts, the @DAK and the @CK for 12 tricks...

pc|h2|at|mitche: Bidding: Well, 4@C was an adventuresome opening bid!! 
There is a lot to be said for it, tho.. When you do not have the majors in 3rd seat, 
the bid can be very effective .. 
In third seat, you are free to innovate, as long as your partner has a sense of humor ... :)
Anyway, here the 4@C bid got 4@S from N. A bid I think is correct.|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: East can beat 4@S by leading her @CJ.. Declarer will lose the @CA, 2 diamonds, and a club ruff.. 
East's hand should probably pass 4@S
The preempt deprived N/S of the chance to look for their best contract. 
Be satisfied that you've jammed their auction. 
Another way to look at it.. It's easier to take 4 tricks than 11..

up|24|pf|y|at|mitche: On to the play: N made a good guess to lead the @H, but I would've tried the @SA 
because I expect declarer to be very short in spades, and I would like to see dummy
This is one of those times where leading an unsupported ace might be right... 
If W opens 1@C instead of 4@C, NS will probably compete to 3 or 4 spades.. 
In first or second seat, the preempt should be disciplined .. but in 3rd seat, with just 3 cards in the majors, why give the opponents  an easy time finding their major suit fit?

pc|da|at|mitche: Bidding: If E/W are using Michaels cue bids, West's hand is the one for it. 
A 2@D bid would announce 5/5 or better in the majors, which would allow East to blast off in spades.. 
If you do not know Michaels cue bids, you can find a lot of good stuff on it at sites like bridgeguys.com
I think you should add it to the conventions you use. It is pretty easy and when it comes up, very useful|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Now, after 1@H, what should N do?
Conventionally, an immediate cue bid (2@H here) says, "limit raise or better in Opener's suit"
Since N has 12 HCP and very nice support for diamonds, the 2@H bid looks pretty good
A 2@D bid would be something like Kx, xxxx, KJxx, xxx
in other words, just a simple raise..|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Over 2@D, I don't know if I'd bid 2@S on what looks like a misfit, but E struck gold with it. 
OK - after 2@S and 3@D, West should not be shy - just bid 4@S. 
West knows that they have an 11 card spade fit (East could hardly bid 2@S with just 4 of them!!)
N/S may decide to let them play 4@S -- who knows?
maspd: I thought you could only use michaels when you have an opening hand and vulnerable?|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Suzie asked when you can use Michaels
My rule of thumb is to use Michaels when you have either a hand with 6-10 HCP OR with 15+ HCP (this is called "min-max")
With 11-15 HCP, I will bid both suits. This way, pard knows if I have a good or bad hand
With the bad hand (6-10), I just pass pard's bid of one of my suits. 
But with the good one, I raise freely|
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: I really do like to get into the auction with distributional hands.. they play a lot better than their high card strength indicates.. 
In this case, E/W can make 5@S with just 18 HCP (and the @HJ is not even useful!!)
calligal: was I misleading my p bidding at the 2 level with 9 HCP
mitche: Gaylene, it isn't that you're misleading him, it's that without a fit, you are just really lucky to catch him with a big fit. Remember, he overcalled - he didn't open

Playing 2 over 1, a simple raise of 1@S (or 1@H) to 2 shows 3 card support and 7 - 9 dummy points, 
or occasionally a really bad 10 dummy points.
So 2@S was the correct bid, with 9 dummy points. 
With 3 card support and fewer points, the correct bid by responder is 1NT, forcing, 
followed by a minimum spade bid (or passing 2@S)|

mitche: So with that knowledge, his job is to find a lead that is unlikely to blow a trick..

At worst, it guesses the club suit for declarer, but then declarer cannot win the @HJ
When your RHO is marked with strength and your partner is likely to be very weak, 
try not to lead away from unsupported honors!

If N bids 2@H, E/W may wind up bidding 3@D and you may beat that at least 2 tricks (vul, no less!)

up|46|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: S led the @CK (most pairs play A from AK and others, but that's not the issue) 
and N correctly played the @CQ
With Qx, it is correct to play the x, not the Queen.
So the play of the @CQ under the K promises either a singleton or the @CJ
Always! without exception!! (remember that, guys!!! You do NOT signal a doubleton with QX)|
pg| ***** 145 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So South, if he continues clubs, MUST NOT lead the ace.
If declarer has the jack, you're going to win a club trick with it later. And if not, your partner will win the jack immediately

sk||pc|d6|at|mitche: Bidding: In third seat, I would not object to N opening 2@D  
As you recall, we had a 4@C opener earlier, 
Here, N lacks a full opening bid and has not got the majors - 
so 2@D may very well take enough space from E/W that they won't get to their best contract|
pg| ***** 160 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: After 1@S overcall, S has the kind of hand that should bid 2@D 
He has 3 card support to an honor and about 9 dummy points.. 
So why not? If N bid on a 4 card suit, the bidding will not end with 2@D, I promise
Your job is to bid what is in your hand, not to bid what is in your partner's hand!|
pg| ***** 161 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: (except in balancing, but that is a different story)
Not to drop names, but when I was living in California, I worked with Lew Stansby, 
who in case you don't know him, he's a multiple world champion and hall of famer
His advice to me - "I just bid my hand and leave the hard decisions to partner"
So South has a 2@D bid. If N had 3 diamonds, too bad!|
pg| ***** 162 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Lew is the second best player I ever met. 
MICK357: 1st?
mitche: The best declarer I ever met? Peter Boyd, another world champ
Back to our lesson: in the actual auction, West heard 1@D, 1@S pass... what should he do?|
pg| ***** 163 ***** |


at|
Well, let's see- with 4 card support and a singleton in the opponents' suit, I think that 3@S is right
This is a preemptive raise, showing a weak hand with good support for the overcalled suit|
pg| ***** 164 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: 2@D would show a better hand, I think (after the 1NT)
Even vulnerable, 3@S is  the winning bid. Note that EW got there anyway.. 
So the bidding might be pass, pass, 2@D, 2@S/ 3@D 3@S   All pass
Marty Bergen says, "support with support" and both S and W had chances to do so...|
pg| ***** 165 ***** |


nt||at|btour:  After the 1@D is Michaels possible?
mitche: I don't like Michaels with 5/4 and an opening hand. 
If you play min-max (as we suggested earlier), then the hand is too strong for a weak 2@D 
and too weak for the strong 2@S, 
so I'd bid both suits|
pg| ***** 166 ***** |


nt||at|The other reason not to bid Michaels is the strength outside the majors..
When you have strength in their suits (the @DK), that usually means that they have strength in your suit
So with defensive card and not ideal shape, I look to bid spades and if the opportunity presents itself, then hearts later.. 
I recommend Jeff Ruben's old book - I think the title is something like "Secrets to Winning Bridge"|
pg| ***** 167 ***** |


nt||at|MICK357: Enough points to bid hearts?
mitche: If the opportunity presents itself - maybe. 
If pard supports spades, why bother to show hearts???
We agree that 1NT by west should show a diamond stopper, yes?
So West should have lifted spades.. not bid 1NT.. |

up|36|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: If I am declarer, I would make a discovery play before playing trumps. 
When S shows up with the @HK and returns a heart at trick 3, I would try the @CQ toward the ace
S will find it very hard to duck, and when he plays the @CK, I know that N needs the @SK to justify his opening bid
So I can then finesse the @SQ with a high degree of confidence|
pg| ***** 179 ***** |


nt||at|This "discovery" play costs nothing. 
Of course, S may just play a small club, but you never know...  he may play the K and give away the entire show !!
BILAsst10: If S doesn't cover do you let the Q ride?
mitche: No, I still win the @CA because I do not have a useful discard if the @CQ loses to the king, 
and besides which, if the @S and @C kings are reversed, I risk going down in an ice-cold contract
losing @D, @H, the 2 black kings and a heart ruff|
pg| ***** 180 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Ok Bergen raises.. 
I think they're very useful and I like them for 2 over 1 systems.
There are other ways to show mixed raises, but Bergen is very well-known and effective 
Besides which, if I said I didn't like 'em, Marty would stop letting me edit his books!!
One last word - I will be out from mid-July thru the end of August ...
