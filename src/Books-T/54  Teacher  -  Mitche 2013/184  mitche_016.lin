^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
He's been mentoring in BIL for 2 years and lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

He learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|

^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

mitche: Hi, everyone and welcome to tonight's 2 over 1 play and discuss session.
2 over 1 means: 
If your partner opens in first or second seat and you bid a non-jump 2 level bid, it is game-forcing.
Also if pard opens 1@H or 1@s in first/second seat, your response of 1NT (with no intervening bid) 
is forcing for 1 round .  Otherwise, the bidding looks a lot like SA|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||at|92612:  Mitch, do you use reverse Bergen with 2/1? 
And do you use drury?
mitche: I prefer regular Bergen, not reverse. 
Because you need the game invite more over the weaker response
Yes, 2-way reverse, but any Drury agreement is useful

sk|e|lb|*cWhat would be your Opening?^^dq^st6hj643cq52dqj75|
pc|DQ|sk||at|mitche: Bidding: well, let's see. South's hand is about as big as you are likely to see in a couple of months.  So 2@C is right - since S can reasonably expect to take 9 tricks, even with a disaster for dummy.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||at|West might decide to gum up the works for N/S with a 3 club bid. 
When you have that solid kind of suit, you can expect that the 2@C bidder has distributional values
So you should try to make it hard for your opponents to describe their hands easily
3@C will make at least 6 tricks, and if you're lucky, partner will also have some fitting distributional values|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So rule #407.58.545  (or thereabouts :) ) - be willing to interfere with big 2@C auctions when you have a long, strong suit
Now after 2@H, N has what could be described as a hopeless hand. 
He has no reason to expect to find a big spade fit
Better, I think, is to bid 3@C (cheapest minor) to show a zero-control hand|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: You can then bid 3@S over 3@H. 
I think 3@S should show something like KQxxxxx and out ... the same kind of hand on which you would preempt 3@S
But this is also a matter for partnership discussion. 
Reason for that idea:
- partner may have the kind of hand where your solid suit could be enough to get her to bid some number of NT|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: In any case, 3@S was a wildly lucky bid.
moonjohn:  Can north bid 3@S over 2 clubs to  show a weak jump shift but long spades?
mitche: The only reason for 3@S over 2@C is holding a suit like AKQxxx or so, 
but this is again a matter for partnership discussion|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: I personally do not like to preempt when partner is known to have a big hand. You lose too much bidding room -- UNLESS you have a very clear meaning for the bid, so the big hand can act intelligently
Mahin, I think the spades need to be a LOT stronger for you to bid 3@S here. 
Better is to tell pard you do not have a good hand|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt||at|moonjohn:  So with this system there is really no way to find that big slam?
mitche: well, yes there is: What would S bid over 3@C?
Which brings me to how did S take the 3@S bid? 
I think that best is to bid 3@D and look for a fit.. |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: But back to the actual auction. After 3@S, S should bet on N having long spades. 
So let's pretend that N has 6 spades and out
S can see 5 outside tricks (the @HAKQ and the @DAK) 
She also can envision a club ruff
If N has just the 6 spades and out, then S should just blast into 6 spades. 
Or if you feel strongly about it, 4NT followed by 6 spades .. 
If S knew that N had 2 clubs, she could bid 7@S|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt||at|2@C should be forcing to the 3 level.
And I think that if responder has as much as a King in hand, then a 2@C bid should get you to game
The 2@C bidder promises a 4-loser hand or better. 
If you have one "cover card" (A or K), you should get to game|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt||at|BILAsst10: why wouldn't 3@S be splinter for hearts?
mitche: It could be a mini-splinter - but again, you need to discuss this with partner. 
I would prefer a very well-defined hand for the jump to 3@S, and playing as a mini-splinter is one way to play it.
Another is as a "picture bid", showing a fit for hearts and some defined holding, like a source of tricks or stoppers...|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: I have 1 partnership where 2@C - 2@D/ 2@H - any jumpshift = 3 card support and KQxxx in the jumpshift suit
I use 2@S (not 3) to show at most a doubleton for the opener's suit. 
Remember that when you open 2@C, you either have a very strong balanced hand or a pretty good suit.
So showing support is really, really essential.
If you show support early, it will help you bid to slam. You do NOT want to start flopping around, looking for a fit, when one partner (the big hand) has announced a good suit|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: My recommended auction: 2@C - 2@D/ 2@H - 3@C/ 3@D – 3@S/ 6@S
OK - we can go on a while - so let me summarize and let's get to next deal
a) responder's first job is to show support. 
b) if you don't have support, your next duty is to limit your hand.  
Limiting your hand means to say if you have any useful high honor|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: If you bid a suit after 2@C (e.g. 2 or 3 spades), you need to discuss what your bid means.
I use a "positive" response 2@C – 2@S to show a hand with 5 or more spades to the KQ10 or better AND an outside K or better, 8 points, in other words 
I use 2@C – 2@D /bid - 3@S to show a solid suit .. KQJxxx - so partner can know exactly what you have|

sk|n|lb|*cWhat would be your Opening lead if you chose diamonds?^^d8^D98754|
pc|DQ|sk||at|mitche: Bidding: How West responds to 2@S depends on how E/W agree on what weak 2 means.
If E/W use weak 2 as "disciplined", i.e. a suit at least as good as QJ10xxx with 5-10 HCP,
then W could ask  with 2NT.|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt||at|The 2NT bid by W here would NOT mean notrump - not yet, anyway
It would say, Please describe your hand further
and East would be required to show a "feature", an outside A or K if she has one.
Then, W would have a better idea if the contract belongs in a game or partscore, in a suit or in NT|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: That is one way for W to handle the hand
If you do not use "feature asking" 2NT, there's a convention called "Ogust", 
where the weak 2 opener can describe both suit quality and outside strength.
But I want you to use disciplined weak 2's and feature-asking here, 
because most people know what those bids mean, 
and you will stay out of trouble|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Now, if I had West's hand and no idea about  East's preempting style, I might bid 3@D which is 100% forcing
RULE: if you are an unpassed hand, any new suit you bid over a weak 2 by partner is 100% forcing for 1 round
If EW used that rule, W could bid a forcing 3@D
Then W could use the additional information (raise, rebid of 3@S, new suit) to place the contract|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Note. If you treat 3@D as forcing, then opener should "cue bid" an ace or K below the level of her suit
Because a weak 2 is essentially a 1-suited hand, you will almost never hold 4 of the other major. 
Some partnerships insist on not having an outside 4 card Major when you preempt with a weak 2
So another thing for your established partnership to discuss
This means that unless W bids 3@H (not a good idea), they cannot find 4@H after the opening 2@S|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: That is the price you pay for "undisciplined" weak 2's
West had to make a guess, so she guessed to try 3NT.
I think that is as good a guess as anything. Bidding 4@S might work, too, if pard has a good spade suit like she does, in fact, 4@S is almost 100%|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt||at|kat827:  After a feature asking 2NT bid by W, if E has no feature, what would E bid?
mitche: East would rebid her suit. Good question!
So 2N asking should be a hand that wants to know if the partnership is playing in 3 or 4 of the major or in 3NT|

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: 
If N wants to lead diamonds, he should lead the 8, I think
When you lead low, you are generally saying you have a picture card in the suit.
So lead that 8, second, not the 4th best @D5! :)
You want to help partner know if returning the suit is a good idea|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Next, in 3NT, S needs to know when to take the @SAce.
For that, she needs to know who has the singleton spade
North can help S here by playing the @S9 instead of the 8
Yes, either the 8 or 9 might be a singleton, but with the 8 being the lowest spade that N can hold, she will have to guess who has the second spade.|
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


nt||at|If you are conscientious about signaling, then the 8 is the lowest spade N can have (S can see all of the lower spots)
.....So the 8 must be a singleton...
And then it is correct for S to duck the first spade
My advice - when there is a long suit in dummy, you should give count signals to help partner know how to defend
If S had the spade ace and others, he would duck in order to see the N count-card|

N can expect S to have the Ace. Look at N's trumps. They are the J108.
What happens if N plays a second round of hearts?|

mitche: If declarer ruffs, the @SJ becomes a trump winner.
But more importantly, declarer cannot get to dummy to cash all the diamonds!
S will hold off on the @DA until the third round
If S has 6 hearts, she should bid 5@H, so N can guess declarer has a second heart|
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So the lesson here is defensive: 
Imagine the line of play that declarer will take - 
In this case, it looks like declarer will try to use the diamonds for discards
How can she do that?|

sk||at|mitche: Bidding: Some people might open 2@D with the N hand, even at this vulnerability
I think it is a matter of style whether you do or don't
My style is to have a bit more, vulnerable, but that is not as important as you and your partner agreeing on how good a weak  should be, vulnerable|
pg| ***** 105 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: East's 1@C is pretty standard. When West bids 1@S, East should raise to 2@S because
W could have a 10 or 11 point hand, and a raise might allow you to explore for a game
After East passes 1@S, however, what should S do?|
pg| ***** 106 ***** |


nt||at|Wayne_LV:  I saw no need to preempt 3@C, but would have had Fred bid again
mitche: as 1@C could be as few as 3, and isn't likely to be as many as 5 
(requiring 1 to be void in the suit, the other with a singleton)
I might risk a 2@C or even a 3@C bid here. 
FM75:  That pushes us into game|
pg| ***** 107 ***** |


nt||at| mitche: The bidding suggests that E opened sub-minimum (he passed 1@S) so partner will not be broke
mitche: east, the fact that it pushes you into game only allows you off the hook for the doubtful pass you made over 1@S|

nt||at|FM75:  ok, but with 4423, I can't get too excited across from passed pard.

Only if the defense leads something other than a @D and E/W are in 4@H does it matter|

nt||at|mitche: Please allow me to editorialize for a moment: 
I think it best to assume that your opponents are bidding correctly. 
My job is to bid my hand as well as possible, and I guess the  opponents try to do the same
In this case, the S hand has (in my opinion) a natural 2@C (or 3@C, at vulnerability) overcall in the balancing seat over this auction|

nt||at|mitche: In the long run, I think I will come out ahead that way. 
And yes, Wayne, sometimes you or your opponents will stop at a part score when you can make game
Editorial mode off
gypsy1308: then I will bid 2@H
mitche: Yes, you might - your hand is pretty good for a first-seat pass.|
pg| ***** 112 ***** |


nt||at|gypsy1308:  I was surprised when he passed tho 3rd seat sometimes light
mitche: Let's notice that S can make 2@C even as the cards lie. 
If East really did open light in third seat, then perhaps the @HA would be with N and the Q with east|
pg| ***** 113 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Now N/S might be able to make 3 or even 4 clubs, depending on how the defense goes.. 
Wayne_LV:  my mindset was my hand was a 3@C preemptive opening bid had Fred passed, it has little value in any suit but clubs, after my p passed I saw no future for us, so I did not bid .. had Fred bid I would have, but I respect your view point
FM75:  Wayne has no defense against spades, his offence to defense ratio is probably a good reason to balance
mitche: I understand your thinking, Wayne; but  here, you are essentially surrendering by not competing over 1@S|
pg| ***** 114 ***** |


nt||at|FM75:  gets partner a good lead
mitche: Your pard could have the 11 point hand instead of the 8 point hand she did. 
Wayne_LV:  Fred, if I overcall 2@C, you will for sure go to 2@S and then I have to go to 3@C and I have little confidence I can make that and might even draw a penalty double
mitche: OK -  .. Please ponder this discussion

pc|sq|sk||at|mitche: Bidding: I think that after 1@C double, pass, East might give some consideration to bidding 1NT instead of 1@D
Reason - he has clubs very well stopped, and his diamonds are pretty anemic
Partner would love to hear about the club stop|
pg| ***** 140 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: I have an acquaintance, named Lew Stansby.  
I do not want to drop names - but we were co-workers many years ago, before he became a 6 time world champ
He gave me the best advice I ever received about bidding: I bid what I have and let partner make the hard decisions.|
pg| ***** 141 ***** |


nt||at|gypsy1308: Yes but what if the 1@C was short and 4/4 Majors?
mitche: Gypsy, if S bid a convenient minor with 4/4 in the majors, East still has a 1NT response to your double. 
I think that West's 2@D bid was pretty aggressive. You normally need about 17 or so dummy points to raise
East could have 0 points, remember!!|
pg| ***** 142 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: That said, once W bid 2@D, she bid every point she had. 
And over 2@H, she should leave the hard decision to East 
East will probably pass, and N/S will have to struggle in 2@H which loses 6 tricks  
(as long as West doesn't lead diamonds) 
FM75:  East's lead would be tough choice since no supported Aces :)|

up|38|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: S has to guess an opening lead. He really has not much to go on.
The spades and hearts rate to be to his left, so the problem is whether to lead from spade shortness or from heart length
I think computer analysis may say the heart is correct. Partner's pass suggested tolerance for hearts
maspd:  I had a tolerance for anything Wayne bid since I had nothing and a flat hand to boot
mitche: true - but, you did not correct 2@H to 3@C.. also - if I am S and wishing for some help, I need less from your hand in hearts ... |
pg| ***** 154 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: In play, East may want to play a club to hand and go after trumps rather than surrendering his heart stop
Anyway the play might be - win the spade ace, club to the ace, diamond, finessing the @DQ 
(S bid twice and would have a very weak hand to bid twice, vul, without that card)
If the @DQ lives, a second club and a second @D. When the king pops, win it and give up the @S.  
You now have a parking place for the losing heart|
pg| ***** 155 ***** |


nt||at|FM75:  Nice, by then I will have found the @CQ
mitche: the @CQ is not the key .. you want to win 3 trumps, 3 spades, the @HA and 2 clubs
In fact, you win 4 trumps, since you will be able to ruff something.|
pg| ***** 156 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: My partners always say, "Mitch why did you do that?" and I always say something stupid, like, "I fell in love with your hand"...
In case of my favorite partner, I fell in love with more than her hand .:)
She is not a bridge player ...
gypsy1308: lol  u married her
mitche: you bet i did :) :)|
pg| ***** 157 ***** |


nt||at|Thanks to Eileen for her generous support and to all of you for your courteous, spirited discussion
Wayne_LV:  LOL cant stand us for another hand, eh>
mitche: I can stand it, Wayne, but at 11, I turned into a pumpkin .. can't make it to midnite any more :)

pc|dk|sk||at|mitche: Bidding: FM75:  sry 2/1 forcing
mitche: 1NT is forcing in both Precision and 2/1
BILAsst10: and what is Fred doing - opening that hand
mitche: beats me .. 
I think he had "last-deal-itis" with his 1@s opening, first seat, vul
The book recommending a 1@s opener on this hand has not yet been written, I think
FM75:  not published yet.. still looking for one|
pg| ***** 167 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: West's got a problem over 1@S 
- I think any bid she makes is wrong for some reason or another
I kind of like 1NT, 
And I think over 2@C I would hate bidding 2@H, because that shows a hand with that shape but without the @sA
So she really has an unbiddable hand|
pg| ***** 168 ***** |


nt||at|Wayne_LV:  does not the 2@H rebid show a 6 card heart suit with invitational points
mitche: No - it shows a hand like x, KJxxxxx, xxx, Jx (sign off)
