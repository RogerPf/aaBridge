^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."
Mitch Edelman aka mitche 


(MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.)

fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Bidding Over Interference - Part 1  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|^b@2Previously we discussed bidding with no interference.
Tonight, I would like to start discussing showing fits when the opponents get into the auction. 
This is pretty standard, in that SA and 2 over 1 don't differ in this respect. 

So we will start the first of 3 sessions on bidding over interference.
We will discuss this topic in  3 parts (tonight only part 1)

1: The opponents make a takeout double.
2: They bid a suit (natural)
3: They make an overcall that does not promise the suit, e.g. Michaels or Unusual NT.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |

^*BPart 1: Bidding after a takeout double^*N 

It matters if your pard opened a minor or a major, because we want to find major fits rather than minor fits.
Here are the basic fit-showing bids after pard opens a MAJOR and it's doubled.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|

- A simple raise shows 3 card support and between 5-7 DUMMY points (i.e.  crummy hand). 
Example: Your pard opened 1@S and your hand is @sJxx  @hxx  @dKxxx  @cJ10xx .... Raise to 2@S 
Chances  are pretty good that the opponents have a heart fit of sorts, and you would not like them to communicate 
that cheaply. Owning the spade suit is a very happy thing. |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at|

- A double raise, e.g. 1@S (X) 3@S is always PREEMPTIVE, showing a weak hand (0-6 HCP) and 4 card support, 
e.g.  @sQxxx  @hxx  @dxxx  @cxxxx. If pard is on a minimum opener, you may get doubled and go down 2, but so what?
They are likely to be making a game somewhere. They won't like guessing at the 4 level. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|

- A triple-raise, e.g, 1@H (X) 4@H shows 5+ card support and a weak hand, 0-6 HCP. 
Example: @sxxx  @hJ10xxx  @dKxxx  @cx  Yes, you have 9 losers, but so what? Let them guess at the 4 or 5-level. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2 
A preemptive raise is designed to do 2 things:

a) Make it hard for the opponents to judge their best spot|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at| 
b) Get you to the maximum LOTT-level (Law of Total Tricks) as fast as possible
(which is very much saying the same thing)


OK - The next couple of ideas deal with "constructive" bidding, where we think the hand belongs to OUR side.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|

Sometimes you have a good hand for partner after the opponents double. 
There are 2 ways to show raises with good hands:  
^*BBROMAD^*N and ^*BJordan 2NT^*N 
(well, there are others, but these are the ones I like) 

- ^*UB^*Nergen ^*uR^*Naises ^*uO^*Nf ^*uM^*najor ^*uA^*nfter a ^*uD^*nouble (BROMAD)|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


at|

With 7-9 DUMMY points and 3-card support, bid 2@C   (Alertable).
For example, after 1@S  (X)  bid 2@C with:  @sQxx  @hxxxx  @dKxx  @cKx
I think a minimum hand for a Bergen 2@C bid here should be 9 losers|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at| 

With 7-9 DUMMY points and 4-card support, bid 2@D   (Alertable) 
For example, after 1@H  (X)  bid 2@D with  @sQxx  @hxxxx  @dKxx  @cKx

I advocate NOT using regular Bergen raises after a double.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


at| 

BILAsst10: Why not? 
mitche: First, I think we give the opponents a chance to double a 3 level bid for lead.
Second reason for not using Bergen raise after the X - we may be getting 1 level too high.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

calligal: Does the same hold true if pard opens 1@S and no take out double....bid as shown above?
mitche:  No. If the opener's LHO passes, we use regular Bergen 
(3@C shows 4-card support and 7-9 dummy points, 3@D shows 4-card support and 10-12 dummy points. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


at|

kat827:  How common is the use of Bergen raises (for Intermediates, for Advanced, for Experts)? 
mitche:  I think that Bergen raises are now used by the majority of tournament players, 
because they are both LAWFUL and they make it more meaningful when you do NOT make a Bergen raise.

For instance, if the auction is 1@S – 2@S, opener knows immediately that dummy has 3-card support and 
the 9th trump is a VERY valuable asset, so knowing early on that you don't have it will help you stay out of 
a lot of poor games.

Example:  You have  @sKQTxx @hAxxx  @dKx  @cQx 
You would not like to try for game opposite 9 points and 3 card support, but if pard has a 4th trump, 
you will win 1 more trick.

OK- back to prepared text.|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
 
- A Jordan 2NT call after a double shows 10+ dummy points and 4+ card support.
Example: 1@H  (X)   and your hand is:   @sxxx  @hKJxx  @dAQJx  @cxx  -  bid 2NT |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


at|

veeree:  Is this Jacoby 2NT?
mitche:  NO. Jacoby 2NT is only:
a) if the opponents do NOT interfere and 
b) with game-forcing values. (GF) |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


at|

Jordan shows a ^*ulimit raise or better^*N, and is ONLY when responder's RHO has doubled.

OK - so what does opener do after a 2NT (Jordan) bid?
Opener rebids after a Jordan 2NT call:|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


at|

- Rebid 3 of major - the kind of hand that would PASS a limit raise. 
Note: If responder has extra values (13+dummy points)  responder may bid on, 
but with 11 or so dummy points, play 3 of your major.
Example: 1@S  (X)  2NT  (p)   - Opener has   @sAJxxx  @hQxx  @dKQx  @cxx   - rebid 3@S|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


at|

- Opener should bid game with any excuse for doing so, 
Example:   1@S  (X)  2NT  (p)   -  @sKJ10xx  @hKQxx  @dAx  @cxx raise to 4@s
 
Note that the second hand evaluates to 15 points after the raise.. So don't hesitate. Just do it!
In other words: 
Rebid 4 of the major - Fast Arrival, no interest in slam opposite a limit raise. 
After a fast arrival 4 of a major, opener shows about 13-15+ total points.. 
So Responder needs 17+ dummy points to make a slam try.|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2 

You can add a LOT of "tricks" to Jordan 2NT 
Some pairs like to use the 3@C rebid by opener to launch a scientific inquiry 
(as range ask and also to ask for singletons).  See ...

|cp|2|at|{^*Hwww.bridgehands.com/J/Jordan_2_Notrump.htm ^*n}|cp|2|AT|  

for one such treatment.

OK - so let's summarize the most important points. 

a) Preemptive raises are designed to obstruct when it is likely the opponents may have a fit or 
own the majority of the points. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


at|

b) Our constructive bids are designed to limit point count and number of trumps held by responder.

but I think that the jump to 4@H is not the best thing to do after 2@D.  
Better is to bid 2@H (which is 100% forcing) to give responder a chance to bid her values, if she has them. 
Responder will say something since 3@C is second negative, it will be 2@S.
I think we have not discussed how to bid after 2@C - 2@D |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Anyway, if W bids 2@S (lying about the 5th spade), 
E will still bid 3@H, and W will bid 4@c.  
Then at least when East bids 4@H she will have been given a shot to find 3NT if it was a possible contract 
or maybe 6 clubs..

sk||pc|HQ|at|mitche:  Bidding:  East has a mild problem after 1@S by partner.  
Her point count is 18 (and a good 18 at that!), so she should think about 2NT. 
She is short a diamond stopper.  
She can bid 2@H here (looks like a lie, but it won't be a problem, I promise).  
2@H sets up a game force (MM: If you're agreement is that reverses are GF), and here is what can happen after:
1@c - 1@s / 2@h |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


nt||at|a) responder bids 2@S to show a 5-card suit and a minimum. Then opener just bids 4@S and is done.  
b) If responder raises hearts, then opener can bid 3@S 
(NOTE- a raise to 3@H should show 4 of them, and by inference, 5 spades)
c) If responder had clubs and not diamonds, she bids 3@C  and again, East can bid 3@S 
d) And finally, if responder has just 4 spades, no club support, no heart raise, she will bid 2NT, 
and E may raise to 3NT or bid 3@S to show 3 of them. |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt||at|So keep that little trick up your sleeve, the reverse bid of 2 in the other major.
As it is, East's 2@C bid shows a hand about an Ace or so weaker than her actual hand.  
2@C shows a weak opener and (usually) 6 clubs.  |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


at|
So remember that reverse to establish a force and elicit more information from your partner.|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt||at|I like the reopening X by North .. 
even vulnerable, the auction said that S should have values (remember, East underbid by 4 or 5 points!)
dee_dee_20:  So is it better to lie about a reverse than jump to 3@C with 5?
mitche:  Well, 3@C rebid by E would show 16-18 and a 6 card suit. 
I think that you can almost always find a better bid than to jump rebid on a 5 card suit.  
In this case, there are 2 reasons not to rebid 3@C |
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt||at|a) suit length, and 
b) the hand is too strong!
dee_dee_20:  Do you play reverses as GF?  Or 1 round Force?
mitche:  I use a reverse as 1 round force in some partnerships.. It's my preferred treatment; 
but you need to discuss with pard to make sure.  
We can discuss what's forcing in one of my next lectures...

S properly played the @H2 to say "no desire for @H continuation", 
but when declarer played the @HK and then a third heart, S can play the  @H9 to say: I like the higher suit,@d's.
Better, when she wins the @SJ, just play on diamonds!  
S knows that clubs are declarer's suit (she passed 2@C), so that says to her, 
"lead diamonds before they disappear on the club suit" |

pc|C7|at|mitche: Bidding:  a) After the 2@H bid, I think that East should just bid 4@H directly.  
A 3@H raise here should be about 11 points, maybe a bad 12.  
With 13 HCP and a doubleton, she has a full opener opposite an opening bid, so she should just bid game 
(an opener opposite an opening bid = game, right??).  
And after the invitational 3@H, West does not have enough to bid game.  She is on a minimum opener.  |
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


nt||at|altak38:  But what about Jacoby 2NT?
mitche: Jacoby 2NT works like this: opener bids 1@H or 1@S and responder shows the big fit with 2NT. 
Jacoby 2NT does not apply when opener starts 1@D and responder bids 1@H.  
Then a rebid of 2NT by opener shows 18-19 HCP and a balanced hand with at most 3 small cards for support OK??|
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Now, East has been really, really unlucky - she caught not 1 but TWO 5-nil trump splits 
(remember the monster 4@H deal we started with?).  
As they say - "stuff happens".

Note - east played spades correctly, even though she lost to the doubleton @SQ6 
- N has 5 trumps, so the odds are 12-7 that S had that spade queen.

sk||at|mitche:  Bidding:  N has the minors and probably would like to bid something to show that fact to pard.  
With 5-5 in the minors and just a single spade, N might make a negative double over 2@H. 
But her hand is just a shade too light to force pard to the 3 level, so I like her pass over 2@S.  
Change the diamonds to Q109xx and I would have doubled 3@H  |
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  If you are going to make pard bid at the 3 level on a potential misfit, 
you need good suits! (and distribution, too).
East's 3@H bid was also good. 
With 4 card support, I might have bid 3 directly, especially at this vulnerability.|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


nt||at|  
It turned out that the negative X would have gotten N/S to 3@S, 
which makes because of the secondary club fit.. that is how close it was 
(but give S a third diamond instead of that club, and 3@s may not make)

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play:  When declarer played the @D toward the dummy, 
she should go in with the King. Why? |
pg| ***** 106 ***** |


at| 
Because a pitch on the @DK is useless to her 
If N ducked the @DA, then declarer's diamond loser went away, 
but finessing gives S the chance to win with the @DQ  |
pg| ***** 107 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Now - back to defense; 
When S wins the @DA, he should cash the spade before playing a second club. 
It is impossible for declarer to be out of spades (remember, pard did not raise spades), 
and when he cashes the @CA, N should signal with the @CJ, not the 10. 
When you signal, play the loudest, biggest card you can afford. 
Or the smallest, meekest, quietest one, as the case may be :) |

mb|p|mb|1N|sk|w|lb|*mWhy would you bid or not bid with West's hand^It fit's the criteria for DONT -I'd bid it~It's only 5/4 in the two suits, I'd pass~The suits aren't strong enough, I would pass.^3|mb|2C|mb|2H|an|transfer|mb|d|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|

sk||at|mitche: Bidding:  The DONT convention says that with a 2-suited hand, 
bid the cheaper one of them when RHO opens 1NT... 5-4 shape is OK in the 2 suits.
BUT you need real suits, and holding this hand, West would do better in the long run to pass 
and let nature take its course.|
pg| ***** 112 ***** |


nt||at|If her hand were something like 
@sx  @hxxx  @dAJxxx  @cQJ9x then the DONT call would be much better.
When you have high cards in short suits, and long, weak suits, don't use DONT.  
Most people play that after 2@C, "systems are on", meaning that 2@H was a transfer to spades.|
pg| ***** 113 ***** |


nt||at|  
East's double of 2@H was a bit light. 
N/S might actually have a secondary heart fit and be able to play 2@H doubled.  
If you double an artificial bid for lead you need a good suit. And Kxxx is not good enough.
Better is something like KQxxx - so at least you can survive the lead and set up a trick if everything is wrong.|
pg| ***** 114 ***** |


nt||at|msphola:  What about an alert?
mitche:  DONT should be alerted, yes  
(remind me to tell you some of the director calls I have had about failures to alert...)

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche:  Play:  After the @HA and continuation, if East recognized 2@C as DONT, 
she can guess that W has diamonds.
(why? If W had hearts, she would have bid them over 2@S. Remember East doubled hearts!!).|
pg| ***** 130 ***** |


at|  
So if declarer is short in diamonds, there may be a ruff coming in the short hand. Lead a trump, not a club.
The club suit can wait - but the potential @D ruff is a different story.|
pg| ***** 131 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Only if your pard has @CAQ does it matter that you shift to a club 
but then you have to ask where declarer's point count is for the 1NT opener 
(can declarer possibly have enough stuff to bid 1NT without the @CA and another high honor?)
Another way to look at it. 
Declarer has the @HQ (clear from the play) so 1 club is going away on it anyway.. |

! What a messy set of deals!
S's 1@C looks right, and so does 1@S
So East has a big hand and what can she say?|
pg| ***** 138 ***** |


at|
ecolodge:  I think maybe I should have just passed?
EddyHaskel: She could say "Defense?"  
mitche:  I think she can say "pass".|
pg| ***** 139 ***** |


nt||at|dee_dee_20: She could sharpen her teeth :)
mitche:  If she is brave, she might say 1NT (singleton diamond and all), 
but pass looks like the only sensible course of action.  
What will happen if E passes?|
pg| ***** 140 ***** |


at| 
S will say 2@C and N will try 2@S (she is really too weak for 2@H, believe it or not). 
And that is where the auction should wind up.|
pg| ***** 141 ***** |


nt||at|Declarer will make 2@S - or maybe 3, but never 4@S. 
And instead of surrendering 200 points for down 2, E/W get out for a quiet -140, a much better result.  
If E finds 1NT, W may insist on playing in diamonds, and that isn't all that horrible. 
The defense gets 3 diamonds and a spade; the heart suit can be picked up with a double finesse  
(Not sure there are enough entries for a double finesse. MM: the 8 will be high...)
Or declarer may have time to toss a heart loser on a spade winner ..

up|42|pf|y|at|mitche:  Play:  A note on suit establishment.  S is on lead with a pretty decent club suit.  
Note that S has 2 entries outside of clubs, and he is on lead. 
If he leads a club, one of declarer's 2 club stoppers gets used up. Then, when he wins his first ace, he knocks out the second club stopper, 
setting up 4 clubs and 2 aces to beat 2NT for sure.. |
pg| ***** 154 ***** |


nt||at|btour:  You can never get yelled at for leading pard's suit :)
mitche: and here, you do :)
So S should lead a club and save the @SA to capture one of declarer's spade honors.. 
and set up those clubs unless you have something better.. |
