^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||at|


^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

mitche: Hi, everyone and welcome to tonight's 2 over 1 bid, play and discuss session.
2 over 1 means: 
If your partner opens in first or second seat and you bid a non-jump 2 level bid, it is game-forcing.
Also if pard opens 1@H or 1@s in first/second seat, your response of 1NT (with no intervening bid) 
is forcing for 1 round .  Otherwise, the bidding looks a lot like SA|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||at|92612:  Mitch, do you use reverse Bergen with 2/1? And do you use Drury?
mitche: I prefer regular Bergen, not reverse because you need the game invite more over the weaker response
Yes, 2-way reverse, but any Drury agreement is useful. 
There are very few GF auctions: 
1@S- 2@C, or 1@S-2@D, or  1@S – 2@H or  1@H - 2@C, or  1@H - 2@D or  1@D – 2@C

sk||pc|sj|at|mitche: Bidding: mitche: After 1@H-pass, what should S do? 
Remember, a 2@C or 2@D bid is forcing to game?
She has just one bid available to her, and that is 1NT, forcing for 1 round
In SA, S would bid 2@D, but she cannot do that in 2 over 1
mitche: She does NOT want to force to game on what may be a hopeless misfit. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||at|Cliff228: Has a rule of 20 hand--some say can answer GF in 2/1
brmac: Do you not take distribution into account with S hand 
mitche: Yes, I do. But shortness in pard's suit and a doubtful-value @SQ make me cautious
joseye:  What if south lied a little and said 3@C?
mitche: What is 3@C???|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt||at|Cliff228: weak...lots of clubs
mitche: If you use Bergen raises (I recommend them) - it shows @H support.
OK - if you do not use Bergen raises, and you have NO agreement, playing 2 over 1, 
3@C is frequently treated as something like AKQxxx and out in clubs
But that isn't our problem here..|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||at|S has 11 HCP and a possible misfit. 
You will have more chances to describe your hand later.. so do not stretch to bid a GF 2@C or 2@D
Anyway, the bid of 1NT is correct, I think|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Now, W asked if she has the stuff to bid 2@S. 
No, she does not. 
A 2-level overcall here shows, above anything else, a suit you really would like pard to lead. 
And you do not want a spade led, unless pard can do so on her own
Even after 1NT, N/S should get to game.. Let's look more deeply into the auction|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: After N bids 2@D, E has nothing to say, so she passes. 
Now, Liza has a hand that has improved greatly. It is worth around 15 points in support of  diamonds
So with a hand that has improved a lot, S may bid 4@D
btour:  could be a 3 card diamond suit
realrowdy:  Did not want to bypass 3NT Mitch...Maybe P has balanced|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So what, S has to bid her hand's values. 
By moving past 3NT, S says 
a) my hand has improved with your second bid. And 
b) my hand is very distributional
N will bid 5@D over 4, and that makes as long as declarer stays awake.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: If N has a minimum hand with say Kxx, Axxxx, Kxx, Qx, 5@D is still a very good spot
Once you find one fit, Liza, there's not much to be gained by looking for a second one.
As far as bypassing 3NT, Liza, your hand is not very no-trumpy... 
you are thrilled to look for a minor suit game (or slam) over 2@D|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: I have no idea why anyone would like S to bid 2@C 
a) still not strong enough. 
b) with 5-5, you bid the higher-ranking suit. I could see an argument for S to bid 2@D, but not much  of one

I think 1@H - 1NT/2@D - 4@D / 5@D.. makes sense. Remember, that if S bid 1NT, she cannot force to game.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt||at|btour:  After 4@D by south how is north to know to go 5

An expert partnership might allow S to bid 2@S (!!) over 2@D, saying "my hand has improved, and this is an artificial @D raise"
Why could S do that?|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


at| 
Because she would have bid 1@S if she had a real spade suit...|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt||at|Cliff228: Wouldn't 3@c after my 2@d be "to play"?
mitche: Yes, 3@C would have been to play
Cliff228: What would I say after 2@S?
mitche: OK - if N/S had allowed 2@S, then you get the best of both worlds.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt||at|Liza supported diamonds strongly, however indirectly, and she can still get to 3NT if that is right. 
It is not  right here,,, 
If you were agreed to use 2@S as an all-purpose forcing bid (and implying good diamonds), N could bid 2NT on the right hand.. in this case, you'd just bid 3@D, since your hand is 
a)  distributional and 
b) not very good stoppers for NT

up|52|pf|y|at|Mitche: On to play!
I want to ask you if you remember the opening lead|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


at|
What do you think of that lead???  (@sJ)
and why? ( Sue just brought some strawberries in, and I cannot eat and type) :)
Cliff228: Usually don't lead from unsupported ace  in a suit contract
backhome->Kibitzers: Get Sue to feed them to you|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: cliff, you are almost completely right. 
In here, NEVER underlead an ace in a side suit at trump contract
In this case the lead did not hurt. That is the only thing positive I can say about it...
In NT, the @S10 might be better - 
Cliff228: Don't you lead higher of a sequence--unless you play coded?
mitche: Yes, but you should play coded 10's and 9's...|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


nt||at|sebstar:  Is there a lead that could hurt?
mitche: not if declarer plays correctly... 
How should declarer play a diamond contract, by the way?|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


at|
Declarer should plan to make dummy (the hand with longer trumps) the "master" hand
Dummy has 1 spade and 3 club losers, so 3@D should be cold. 
Can Cliff do better?|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt||at|Yes, He can try to ruff out a side suit. Win the spade, play a club at trick 2.
BILAsst10: Can it be cross ruffed?
mitche: If you try to ruff hearts, that requires 4 entries to hand - ruff 3 hearts and return to cash long one
N has that many entries if he plans the play carefully..
Note that a 4-3 @H division is more likely than a 3-3 @C split.|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Your homework: plan the play for N if he wanted to try to set hearts up...

moviemaker: By clicking on the cards, you can play the hand Double Dummy.
You can choose any lead (try trumps:) )

sk||pc|hk|at|mitche: Bidding: After 1@C-1@D    N decided to bid 1@S, 
(I guess he was planning to bid and rebid hearts to show his 5-5) 
I am guessing that Liza and Cliff both took 2@D to show spade support
In standard bidding, 2@D by OPENER generally shows a @D stopper (the overcalled suit) and is looking for 3NT
If RESPONDER makes the 2@D bid, then it shows a limit raise (or more) for opener's suit|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt||at|So if you intend to use 2@D this way, 
a) discuss with pard, because it's not standard and 
b) remember to alert it
Anyway, Cliff thought that 2@D shows spade support, and he bid 4@S. 
Aggressive, but not completely unreasonable. At IMPS, it would probably be a consensus bid.|

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: How should Cliff plan the play? 
What losers does he have?|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


at|
He has 5 heart losers and a club, so he has to figure out how to dispose of 3 of those losers.
What can dummy do to help?|
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: He can get rid of 1 heart on the diamonds. 
He expects the @DK to be in W hand, so he can try to ruff it out and ditch 1 heart  on the @DJ
He then must plan to ruff 2 hearts in dummy. 
So after the (friendly) heart lead and club plays at trick 2 (he now needs just 1 heart ruff!), 
he wins the @CQ and plays 2 rounds of diamonds to set up his heart discard|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: He then needs to play carefully - heart ruff, diamond for discard, and now another heart ruff . 
Then (as the cards lie) he ruffs a third heart and discards his last one on the @CK,
East will furr, but that is the only other trick the defense gets
furr - dyslexic "ruff"... :)
backhome:  its the strawberries|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: But the important point. 
Declarer has to plan his play before he plays from dummy at trick 1
One point: West should NOT win the @CA at trick 2; 
He should play a low club, so that declarer can win just 1 club trick instead of 2.. 
And another point. After the @HK wins at trick 1, what should East play?|
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: I would shift to a trump. 
Declarer is now never going to get his heart ruffs... 
How should East know to do this?|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


at| 
He can see that if declarer has hearts, they will be ruffed in dummy, and a trump will protect defense's heart tricks|
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Do you find the discussion on declarer play useful? 
It slows things down a lot, and I want to make sure you get some value from it, instead of playing more deals
sebstar:  We all need to plan better play, so yes, it's valuable
BILAsst10: Isn't declarer play very important - why continue making the same mistakes

pc|ca|at|mitche: Bidding: a) I don't know what is right on this hand 
(wild distribution is hard to analyze), 
but you can make a case for Cliff to overcall 4@D instead of a modest 1@D
Reason - he's going to bid 4@D over 3 of either major, so he may as well try to take up as much bidding room as he can.
Also, b) E/W may decide to defend 4@D doubled instead of bidding on to game|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: West will not sit for 4@DX, but rather, she is going to bid 4@H anyway 
(and in fact, she should bid 4@H over 1@H)  (or even better, 4@D)
btour:  But 1@H shows 5
mitche: No, 1@H shows some values and not the ability to make a negative X...|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


nt||at| Modern tendency is to make the same bid at the one level as you would make without the defensive bid 
(X or overcall), so E has a decent 1@H response over 1@C - 1@D
BILAsst10: need 4/4 M to make a negative X (and 1@h denies 4 spades)
mitche: So I think the bidding might be : pass, 1@C (4@D) 
And now East has a problem....|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


nt||at|She has to pass, 
If the bidding is 1@C (4@D) pass, pass, W reopens with either a double (do something smart) or 5@D
I would reopen with the X - pard will bid a major, hopefully, and I will raise to 5... 
Preempts are hard to overcome, but with the void and monster hand, I will look for a slam

There is something to be said for each action. 
I would have raised 1@H to 2, because I have good 3 card support and I can take ruffs in spades
2@C is OK -   most of the time S will have 4 cards when she bids 1@C; 
2@D would be running the risk that pard has not got very much in diamonds, so it is my least favorite call|

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: This looks like a defensive problem.. 
East sees long hearts and can count her pard for at most 1 heart, 
so it might be best to lead a small heart at trick 2. 
If declarer plays the - queen - oops!!!!
anyway, she shifted to the @D6 at trick 2.|
pg| ***** 130 ***** |


nt||at| mitche: Declarer correctly unblocked diamonds at trick 3 and went after trumps.
You recall that she played A, K and then small to the queen.
It is hard to see that declarer's correct play is to finesse the @C10
Why?|
pg| ***** 131 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: If east produces the @CJ (so that playing the queen would have dropped it), 
then declarer has 4 diamonds to go along with her 3 trumps and the heart. 
So the contract makes
But if the queen does NOT drop the jack, then the defense can pump dummy when it gets in . 
Now declarer may lose spades.|
pg| ***** 132 ***** |


nt||at| This brings me back to trick 1... 
Defender's best option at trick 2 is to force dummy to ruff a spade. 
Now, declarer will eventually lose control of the hand 
and the defense will be able to cash spade tricks to hold 2@D to 8 tricks

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: When declaring at NT, you count WINNERS... 
After the OL (opening lead), declarer has 2 hearts, 3 diamonds, 2 clubs for sure
Declarer's attempt to set up spades was well-intended, but not the best line for the contract.
One way to play is to cash the @DAKQ and then play clubs. 
If @D are 3=3 the hand is over, and if not, she can try the @SQ 
(hoping that the long hearts are in the hand with only 1 spade entry
I think the best line is to play the @DAKQ.|
pg| ***** 154 ***** |


nt||at| If @D don't split, then declarer plays the @SQ and hopes to take a spade finesse against the @S10 later
You need a lot of luck to bring in this contract, despite 26 HCP, because both hands are 4333.

sk||pc|h9|at|mitche: Bidding: Another wild hand from the random hand generator (yeah, right)
I think south might try 2NT (2 lower unbid suits) instead of 1@H ,
msphola:  I had a midi hand
mitche: because: a) with good 5-5 distribution, it'll allow N to blast off when that is correct... 
I don't know why you think this is a midi.. it has excellent 5-5 and 14 HCP, 
and will happily raise pard to show that strength.|
pg| ***** 164 ***** |


nt||at|You would have a midi without the @CK, for instance
Anyway... after 1@H and 1@S, N has a 10-loser hand and should just go quietly. 
Even thinking about bidding 2@H here is an overbid!
Anyway, after 1@S, and 2@H, what should East do?
I think that East might bid 4@C (splinter) . ... 
Then over S's double, West might bid 4@H, showing the @HA|
pg| ***** 165 ***** |


nt||at| Eventually, E will have a chance to bid a high number of spades after the (hopeful) 5 club bid by N
btour:  really interesting. We can be down how many against a vul slam?
mitche: Well, you cannot bid over 7@S, and you cannot set it, 8 clubs is not a legal bid 
BILAsst10: 2NT by south would make things somewhat more difficult for E/W
mitche: This is another reason for the 2NT overcall. 
N can blast off in clubs and probably keep E/W from getting to 7@S|
pg| ***** 166 ***** |


nt||at|Although not getting to 6 is a huge win for N/S
I think the bidding should be : 1@D (2NT) 3@S (5@C) / ?????
East must  guess whether to bid 6 with 2 heart losers.. or West, with 2 club losers... 
If E/W have worked out forcing pass, then E can bid 5@s|
pg| ***** 167 ***** |


nt||at|The way most pairs play forcing pass is: 
- With no losers in the overcalled suit, bid on. 
- With 1 loser, pass, 
- and with 2 losers, double. 
Then when E bids 5 spades, W knows "no club losers" and may gamble on 6 with the @HA, 
In any event, after maximum interference, it gets really hard for E/W to reach their ice-cold grand. 
Even a small slam is guessing...
