^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||at|


^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

mitche: Hi, everyone and welcome to tonight's 2 over 1 bid, play and discuss session.
2 over 1 means: 
If your partner opens in first or second seat and you bid a non-jump 2 level bid, it is game-forcing.
Also if pard opens 1@H or 1@s in first/second seat, your response of 1NT (with no intervening bid) 
is forcing for 1 round .  Otherwise, the bidding looks a lot like SA|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||at|92612:  Mitch, do you use reverse Bergen with 2/1? 
And do you use Drury?
mitche: I prefer regular Bergen, not reverse. 
Because you need the game invite more over the weaker response
Yes, 2-way reverse, but any Drury agreement is useful

sk||pc|cq|at|mitche: Bidding: In third seat, I think that S should open his hand with 1@C
Why? The hand has 2 1/2 quick tricks and a decent 5 card suit. 
But S did pass, and W opened a sensible 1@D, overcalled and 1NT response
All quite reasonable, as was 2@C
But what should double over 2@C mean?|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: In Standard American, that double would be penalty-oriented
Because the doubler is behind the club bidder.
But a lot of people also use it as takeout.  
Pattipat: Wouldn't east have bid hearts if she had them?
mitche: aha! yes, after 1@S, if East has 4 hearts and about 8 points, she would have doubled 1@S, negative.
The fact that she did not negatively X says at most 3 hearts.. |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt||at|So 1NT says "spade stopper, 7 to perhaps 10 points"
And it also says "no heart suit"
No matter how you and pard agree to play the double here, N should probably raise clubs, rather than redouble.
Conventionally, some people use the redouble to say "A or K of this suit" (a "romex" double)
But that is also rather not for casual partnerships....|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So I would have bid 3 or even 4 clubs with the N hand instead of XX
probably 3@C 
Pattipat: we would go down big time :)
mitche: N has 7 HCP AND a singleton @D the suit W bid
The singleton is worth something, you know
In clubs, N/S win 8 tricks for sure, maybe 9 if E/W misdefend
Down 1 isn't bad if E/W can make 3 or 4 diamonds or hearts.

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: OK - on to Play: 
After the opening lead, declarer can lead a heart to dummy and take a trump finesse, 
followed by the trump Ace,
When this works, W just plays winning hearts to discard 2 spade losers and cross-ruffs.  
S is welcome to his diamond trick, and E/W make 11 tricks (losing just a spade at the end)
Note that even if the trump finesse loses, this line allows you to make 5 because N can't lead a spade without sacrificing his side's trick

sk||pc|sq|at|mitche: Bidding: First - the 2@C bid created a game-forcing auction.  
N said, "I have enough strength that we should be in game opposite any opening bid"
We are NOT playing SA where 2@C would have shown 10 or more points
That is the understanding on 2 over 1 that whenever first or second seat opens
then a NON-JUMP bid by responder at the 2 level is forcing to game|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So 1@D – 2@C requires the partnership to get to game
OK - so if 2@C is game forcing, what should S rebid?|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


at|
Pattipat: 2NT showing stoppers in other suits
mitche: Well, I am not sure that 2NT is the best idea.
S has a pretty nice @D suit, so 2@D is about right
This almost 100% guarantees 6 cards in the suit|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: When S jumps to 3@D in this game-forcing auction, it says "I have 6 solid diamonds"
Since S is missing the @DK, it's better to bid 2 than 3
Remember, you aren't getting passed out in 2@D!!!!
Ok- but S bid 3@D... N bid 3@H|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Here is the standard rule for raising partner's second suit (either opener's or responder's):
You need 4 of them
period
So S should not bid 4@H
If S has a spade stopper, then he should bid 3NT
If S has 3 card support for clubs (responder's first suit), after the 3@H bid, he should bid 4@C
(with both a spade stop AND support, I bid 3NT, our most likely game)|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: NOW, HERE IS THE RUB!!!
If you play what Marty Bergen calls "Italian Cue bids", then 3@H means "I have @D support, the suit that S jumped in"  AND 
"I also have first or second round @H control (A, K or  singleton)"
The idea is - I have a holding that will prevent the other guys from winning 2 quick heart tricks. 
And I am slamish|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: If N/S use this treatment, S can bid 3@S 
(I can prevent them from winning 2 quick spades) 
If N/S do use Italian control bids, they will get to 6@D which is unbeatable as the cards lie
Now, how should N/S bid to slam ?
After 3@D  and 3@H,  S bids 3@S, N bids 4@C and S now bids 4NT (or whatever you use for ace-asking over a minor)
And you get to 6@D when N shows 2 key cards

up|45|pf|y|at|How should S play 6@D?
Well. the @C finesse is on, but S should not take it!
I think the play should be win the spade, play AK and ruff a club with the J
If the clubs are 3-3, you are home. If not, play 3 rounds of trumps ending in dummy and ruff another club|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: You make the hand whenever clubs are 3-3 or 4-2 or the @CQ is singleton. 
About 90% chance
BILAsst10: and trump are not 4-0
mitche: Maybe, if the long trump is with the long club, you are still OK
As long as the second round of clubs doesn't get ruffed, you are golden

pc|h7|at|mitche: Bidding: 1@D - 1@S/ 2@D are all fine 
And 2NT is not completely unreasonable for S (but I would have passed 2@D, I admit)
After 2NT,  North's 3@D bid says "I have diamonds and diamonds and diamonds"
So for S to bid 3NT, he must have the @DA or K, to assure that the suit will run
If N's diamonds were ready to run, she would have bid 3NT, not 3@D|
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: This is kind of important, so remember it:  
When you have a 6 or 7 card minor, bid 3NT whenever the suit is headed by the AK (in this kind of auction (of course)
but when you rebid 3@D, you absolutely deny the A and K both, so your partner must have one of those 2 cards to bid 3NT...

With this holding Q10x opposite Axxx the standard, book play is to lead little to the Q10x 
and to put in the 10 
If it loses to the K, you take 2 or 3 tricks. 
It loses only when S has the K and N the J

realrowdy:  I assumed X was for major  sorry
mitche: (oh, is everyone aware that 2@D was the Michaels convention?)
After E announces 2 long majors, then double should mean "I have enough to double one of them"
There are conventions (unusual over unusual) to allow you to show the majors after a 2-suited overcall, but when E announced both of them, N/S should be showing stoppers|
pg| ***** 125 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So the problem here is trying to untie what the double means.
I recommend using this as your defense against Michaels:
If you double the Michaels bid, it says "I have one of their suits locked up"
And I want to defend if they bid that suit
So S should have something like K10xxx in one or the other major
And about 9 or 10 points
If you bid a major, it says "I have enough strength to look for game (in NT or your minor)" and I have a stopper in this suit|
pg| ***** 126 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: And a NT bid shows both of the Michaels' bidder's suits. If you know what the suits are
So S might bid 2@H over 2@D - 
But X should be a better heart suit, I think

sk||pc|d3|at|mitche: Bidding: After 1@D - pass. N has a hand that wants to bid 1@S
With 7 points as responder, you pretty much have to bid
And North's spade suit is perfectly respectable 4 card suit.
So bid 1@S|
pg| ***** 147 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  S will raise to 2@S (or should) and that should be that
Why should S bid 2@S over the 1@S that I suggested N bid?
S raises to 2@S with 3 good spades (Axx is 3 good spades) and a singleton 
But the actual auction saw East balance with 1@H (would East ever balance with a double?)
and W settled for 1NT
azin: with 11 points?|
pg| ***** 148 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Yes, with 11 points.. East passed in first seat. A BALANCING bid here could be quite weak. In effect, East "borrowed" an ace from west to bid.
So West needs pretty nearly a full opening bid to get frisky.
So W knows there is no game for his side and correctly bids what he thinks is the best part score
Balancing is different from overcalling..

up|52|pf|y|at|On to the play: 
N decided to lead a diamond (the suit her partner bid) -- but she led the 3.
Lead the top of your doubleton here.. the 3 suggests length or an honor... 
Let's see if N/S can beat 1NT.
After the @D opening lead, E/W have 2 diamonds, 2 spades, 1 heart, and 1 club. 
But I suspect S will have to give up the 7th trick one way or another.|
pg| ***** 163 ***** |


nt||at| 
S will have to win an early spade and just exit with spades
Any red card lead from S will allow the contract to make
Wayne_LV:  they made it more difficult by holding up on both majors
mitche: the heart holdup was good defense.. |

fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2mitche: OK -- 
I think I would like to discuss opener's rebids after a game-forcing 2 over 1 bid
Let's start by asking what responder has for a 2 over 1 response to 1@H or 1@S

a 2@C or 2@D bid promises a 4 card or longer suit and an opening bid
So with xx, KJx, AQxxx, Kxx you would bid 2@D over 1@S

If your hand were xx, KJx, KJxxx, Kxx, you would NOT bid 2@D (as you might in SA)
You would bid 1NT forcing

So opener has heard 2@C (let us say) over her 1@S opener
An immediate raise (of 2@C to 3@C) shows 4 card support 
If opener lacks 4 card support, he bids a 4-card or longer red suit. 

With no support or second suit to bid, opener's rebid should be 2NT with a balanced (5332) hand

Remember - you are not going to be passed out - so 2NT is still forcing
Most pairs play that 2NT shows any balanced hand, and could be stronger than the SA 2NT, which is a minimum hand
In any case, 2NT is natural 

If opener rebids his major, it usually is a 6 card suit (but it might also be a good 5 bagger).
Example KQJxx, Axx, x, Qxxx - opener starts 1@S, and responder bids 2@D
2NT is out (we aren't balanced)
and 3@C should be a better suit. 
So by default, you rebid 2@S|

^b@2

What should it mean when the auction goes 
1@S – 2@D
3@C?
It should show a good second suit, something like KQxxx, Axx, x, KQxx
Another way to think of this is to use Losing Trick Count.
A rebid at the 3 level should be a hand with 6 losers or so
The idea here is that when you bid a new suit at the 2 level. you have a 7- or 8-loser opener, and a new suit at the 3 level is about 1 winner better than that

One auction I want to mention: 
1@S – 2@C (or 2@D or 2@H) 
3@S

When you ^*Bjump^*N rebid your suit in this auction, you are advertising both a 6 card suit and also one that can be trumps opposite a small singleton 
So the minimum quality suit is KQJ9xx
That suit is (usually) going to play for 1 loser opposite a singleton
In 2 over 1, jumps below game promise solid suits.

kat827:  Is it a solid suit if there is no Ace?
mitche: If the suit can play for 1 loser without the ace, yes.. 
KQJ9xx will lose just 1 trick When the opposition's holding is 3-3 or if you are lucky enough to catch a doubleton T8 or AT
Better is KQJ10xx, which is almost sure to play for 1 loser
The idea of a jump is to allow you to bid 3NT or 4 of the major when that is right... |

^b@2

So let's summarize:

We will raise partner's suit with 4 card support. If we happen to have a 6 card major, tho. we will rebid it

One other situation deserves discussion
1@D – 2@C
2@H - in SA, this shows extra values. 
In 2 over 1, you need to discuss whether this sequence (a reverse by opener) shows extra strength or is just bidding out your hand pattern
Either way has pluses and minuses, but whichever way you play it, you need to discuss it with your partner:

Exampe:  QJ10x, AQJxx, Qx, Kx
This 15 point hand is opened 1@H and over 2@D, do you bid 2@S or 2NT?
My preference here is to bid 2NT, because the hand is a minimum (and I like a club lead to come into my hand)
And with QJ10x, AQJxx, Ax, Kx, I will bid 2@S

Note that some pairs will bid 2@S with both hands, which I think makes it harder to bid to slams
My rule of thumb is that even playing 2 over 1, I expect a reverse by opener to show a 6 1/2 or so loser hand
Wayne_LV: playing weak NT makes that hand easy to bid since 2NT shows 15-17 HCP rather than the normal 12-14 HCP
mitche: Wayne, there are lots of advantages to weak 1NT, but there are complications, too... 

I will be away for about a month - getting my hips fixed, so I'll be in hospital and rehab for a couple of weeks, and after that - more rehab!
So here is your lesson for the next month .. read 5 card majors by Hardy... Excellent book!
Ok - have a most pleasant summer - I will probably be online sometime after the 10th of August - look for me|
