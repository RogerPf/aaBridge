^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
He's been mentoring in BIL for 2 years and lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

He learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |

^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

mitche: Hi, everyone and welcome to tonight's 2 over 1 play and discuss session.
2 over 1 means: 
If your partner opens in first or second seat and you bid a non-jump 2 level bid, it is game-forcing.
Also if pard opens 1@H or 1@s in first/second seat, your response of 1NT (with no intervening bid) 
is forcing for 1 round .  Otherwise, the bidding looks a lot like SA

at|mitche: bidding: Bidding over preempts is a difficult part of the game. 
I don't know that I would bid 4@C with East'S hand, but it does give NS a problem...
Wayne_LV:  6 losers, used rule of 2 and 3
mitche: Wayne your hand has 7 losers... 
Your unsupported queen is technically not a loser, but I would not count on it being worth much of anything on offense
Rule of 2 and 3: a preempter should be willing to risk down 2 (vul) or 3 (non-vul) when preempting.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: North decided to reopen with a double (correctly, I think - S could have heart shortness, for instance, along with 3 or 4 clubs to the K)
Anyway.. when N doubles, South may not pass without trump TRICKS
If you pass the reopening double in this situation 
a) you have trump tricks and 
b) you do NOT have a fit for pard
glendaelle:  What if i didn't have 4 hearts?|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: You bid 4@H with 3 of them. 
Or if you do not have heart support, you bid your best suit.  
The double says "I can tolerate whatever you bid"|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt||at|
Wayne_LV:  Mitch, do you use rule of 9 for test of leave X in or bid?
mitche: I use the rule of 10 and 12 - See Klinger's 100 bridge tips book for a complete writeup.
We will do a discussion of it after the 6 boards. 
OK .. so S bids 4@h and that is the final contract. 
The preempt has deprived NS of the room to look for slam

At this form of scoring, I might have given some consideration to leading my singleton spade. 
If pard has either the @SA or @HA (or declarer takes a losing  finesse into partner's king), I hope for a ruff..
Declarer should not play a third round of trumps - once the defenders' trumps have been removed in 2 rounds, she can use the extra trumps to ruff out a club and a diamond to take 12  tricks instead of 11
Declarer counts 4 spades, 4 hearts, 2 diamonds, and 2 ruffs...

sk||at|mitche: bidding: EW found their fit, so to speak.. 
NS, being vulnerable, decided to defend, rather than balance
Questions on bidding?
I have one, then .. If you were South, would you have doubled 1@H for takeout???
Just wondering...|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt||at|aliceland2:  We could have found spades that way
mitche: I am not advocating a takeout double over 1@H, but I want you to think about the bid - 
If EW have a fit in either clubs or hearts, then NS rate to have one in either spades or  diamonds.
irinica:  S has 4/4 of the unbid suits
mitche: So if S has a singleton heart, for instance, then I would have doubled, even at these colors
The way the game is played now, you cannot afford to let the opponents play at a low level when they have a fit.    
Just a thought ...

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: N decided to lead a diamond, the unbid suit. 
This rates to be OK, since EW did not sniff at a notrump contract
Do you remember the card S played to trick 1?
It was the @D3
I think playing the 9 is correct, because at this point, S needs to say "it is safe for you to play another @D when you get in"|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: When partner makes the opening lead, the most important thing you can convey, playing third, is whether the suit she led was a good or bad choice.
In this case, the @D was a good idea 
Note that S has the @DJ8 left - so it works well for her to wish for a @D continuation.|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Now - there is a more important idea to look at. 
When W bid spades, both N and S can guess that she has 4 of them.. Right?
How can West deal with her spade losers?   By ruffing them
So one of the defenders should lead trumps when they get in .. will it cost a trump trick? maybe - but it will come back when declarer cannot cross-ruff hearts and spades|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: When you see that declarer will need ruffs to make her contract, and in this case, the bidding tells you that she is ruffing spades - lead trumps (it only hurts for a moment)
The defense will then score 2 trump tricks and declarer will lose 4 spades... |

at|mitche: Once North passes 1@C, S should reason "pard is broke - my hand is a minimum opener, and I have just 5 clubs. Discretion is the better part of valor, as they say, so I should pass"
Note that EW can take 7 tricks against 2 clubs, and if they should happen to double and defend, they rate to score 300|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So South should be very, very careful about bidding again. 
The @SQ is very doubtful, so she has just 11 working points
Should West have pushed the bidding to the 3-level? 
Probably yes - she has aces and kings, and 4 card support. So the 3@c bid, showing a limit raise or better, is reasonable
maspd: i did not have a suit I could bid over 1@c
mitche: your pass over 1@C was proper

Marshall Miles (one of the all-time greats) made the observation, "when you have cards in their suit, they are likely to have strength in yours"
Note that anything N might have said over 2@h is leading to a large minus score
Well, 3@c will lead to a small minus score :)

I think her plan should be to lead a diamond to set up some tricks there (best is the @DK- high card from short side) and then to hope to use her baby trumps to ruff cards. 
If she can score a couple of diamonds, a spade, she may scramble home with 3 ruffs (or overruffs, as the case may be)

sk||at|mitche: bidding: Please look at the East hand. 
It meets the "rule of 22" - that is the good old rule of 20 plus 2 more for quick tricks 
The rule of 22 is - count up your high cards, the length of your 2 longest suits, and your quick tricks. If the sum is 22 or more, you should open. 
Especially when you have the  majors, you should open|
pg| ***** 117 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So I would hope East opened 1@h
S will overcall 2@c and W will bid 2@s
BILAsst10: where 20 come from Mitch - extra one for the @Hs?
mm: 19 + 3 QT's?
mitche: I will push to open with quality suits. And with the majors
I think that experienced tournament players open this hand nonvul vs vul 95% or more of the time|
pg| ***** 118 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: You can add 1 point for what Bergen calls a "quality suit"
That is a suit with 3 of the top 5 honors 
(and 1 of the top 2), i.e. KJ10xx or better is what Marty calls a "quality" suit
Anyway, after 2@S, N will happily bid 3@c
OK - on to the rest of the bidding - as it transpired, N had a decision over 3@S|
pg| ***** 119 ***** |


nt||at|I would not bid 4@d - reasons - 
a) it is above 4 of partner's suit. 
b) I need about 2 or 3 more diamonds and 
c) my hand is not strong enough to bid freely at the 4 level
If my agreement allows it, I might make a negative double|
pg| ***** 120 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: But even there, I think my hand is too thin to force pard to bid at the 4 level. 
I think N's best action is to pass
East's 4@s bid makes sense in the context of the actual auction. She has favorable vul, cannot see more than 2 tricks on defense (W does not rate to have a defensive card), so the  save is good bridge sense
And that reminds me - WEST: when you preempt with a 3@S bid, you should not have a defensive trick outside of spades. 
Your @CA is a winner on defense, so just bid 1@S

up|29|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: : North led the @DA against the ambitions 4@s contract. 
Better by far is to lead a small club, the suit partner bid. 
Leading a diamond here - any diamond - is just too likely to cost the defense a trick. 
So you have a chance to lead the suit pard bid and not to lead a very risky @D|
pg| ***** 131 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: West - when you ruffed a heart back to your hand, the heart suit was set up for discards.
a) lead the @SQ, not the spade 2 to pull trumps.
You plan to go up with the ace anyway, but the @SQ gives N a chance to go wrong by playing the K
b) - ruff a diamond, rather than play a second (losing) trump. You can then play a winning heart to discard a losing club|
pg| ***** 132 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: Do you all see what we are doing here? The @HK drew the ace. 
The defense had already set up a club for itself (at trick 3)
So if E-W are to make the contract, they must get rid of that club loser immediately, because as soon as the defenders get in, they are going to cash the club to beat the contract|
pg| ***** 133 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: Even if by some weird circumstance N can ruff the heart (meaning that South was dealt 17 cards :) ), it is with his trump King, which is always a winner
This deal makes it very easy to understand the need for you to plan your play. 
Planning means to count your losers and if there are more of them than you can afford to give up, to look for a way to eliminate some of them|
pg| ***** 134 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: Here, declarer had 4 possible losers - the 2 diamonds, a spade, and a club. The only way to avoid one of them (the club) was to use the hearts 
And he had to do it before the  defense got in.

sk||at|mitche: bidding: After 2@h by West (I like the bid, by the way, even with 4 HCP, the singleton is useful, so 2@H is OK), 
N has a problem
I would give consideration to bidding 2@S:   
a) I think the hand "belongs" to NS, i.e. they have the balance of strength and 
b) you suggest a lead.  
Perhaps something else would be  better, but I want to get my bid in.|

nt||at|Dianne0516: How about a neg X 
mitche: I don't know how 2@S will turn out (today it's not going to work very well :( ) but I'm bidding it anyway
If my pard treats a double as negative there, I might use it -- but alas, many players use the double there to show a high honor in the suit pard overcalled (it's called a Romex  double), 
So no, my bidding system doesn't treat the X as negative ..

nt||at|mitche: And that brings me to East's 3@H bid. 
East has length in diamonds - in front of the diamond bidder, so the chances are really good that my diamond length is useless, and the @DK is  not too valuable either
That means, I think East is best off passing.|

nt||at| Dianne0516: How many hcp do you need with that Romax X?
FM75:  A neg X is a responder's X
mitche: FM... you are correct. A neg X is made when your pard starts the bidding and your RHO overcalls... But some people like to use it as negative in this situation. I think that is  a bad, bad idea
The Romex X is used specifically to show the A or K (some play A, K or Q) of partner's suit
Dianne0516: So that's all you have?
mitche: That way, the overcaller can lead from AQJxx without fear of blowing a trick.|
pg| ***** 146 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: I play it as weakish, and with just 3 or fewer card support
Dianne0516: Isn't there a chance you are doubling them into a game?
mitche: It is a useful tournament gadget
Wayne_LV:  Would that not be dangerous if E held a strong hand  and redoubled? 
mitche: That is why you should be using sound overcalls :) 
And pard should not defend anyway, if you have a fit
I think most people use the Romex X with about 6 points or so at the 2 level...

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: 3@H is courting disaster, especially if West's 2@h bid is on the strength of a normal raise 
At trick 2, after N won the @SA, she returned a @D.
Which one did she lead?|
pg| ***** 161 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: It was the 5
I think that it is conventional and also correct to lead the 10 in this situation, so pard will 
a) get the count right and 
b) to hold the lead, should East duck an intermediate  honor
When you lead the 5, pard will think you have an odd number of cards, or possibly that you are underleading a picture card|
pg| ***** 162 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: Declarer has no play for the contract - there are too many losers in diamonds for dummy to ruff. 
She tried to use dummy's trumps for ruffing, but that was frustrated when N showed up with 3 hearts. 
Unlucky - but also self- inflicted. 
When you have length in the overcaller's suit, especially when your LHO overcalled, you need extra strength to bid to the 3 level.|

^b{ Klinger's rule of 10 and 12 }|fp|1|ht|f|cs|3|at|
^b@2mitche: I'll go over Klinger's rule of 12 and 10, which helps you decide whether to pass your partner's  takeout double.

Here is the problem:
Your pard made a takeout double and you need to decide whether to bid or pass
What are the general conditions where you would even think of passing?
There are 2 of them: 
- First, and most important - you need to have a trump stack. How much of a stack, we will discover
- Second - we must NOT have a fit with partner.

If pard doubles a 1-level bid, she has either a very good hand with an independent suit or a hand short in opener's bid suit, and almost always, 4 card support in at least one  major.

So let's suppose you have @sQ10xx, @hx, @dKQJxx, @cAxx and your LHO opened 1@d and pard doubles.
You know (or should strongly suspect) that your side has a spade fit.
So that means - bid to show your fit and don't even think about passing 1@D

There are 2 rules for deciding whether to pass the takeout double, what Ron Klinger calls the rules of 10 and 12. 
The Rule of 10 says: 
ADD the number of trump tricks you expect to win to the number of tricks the opponents are trying to win
If that number is AT LEAST 10, you should consider passing the double. 
Example: you are planning to defend at the 1 level. The opponents are trying for 7 tricks. 10 - 7 = 3. 
You need at least 3 trump winners to consider passing
So the higher the contract, the fewer sure trumps you need - at the 3 level, 10 - 9 = 1. 
You must have at least one sure trump trick to consider passing|
pg| ***** 165 ***** |


nt||fp|1|cp|2|at|^b@2

mitche: Example: you hold @sx, @hQxx, @dAJxxx, @cKxxx
Your pard opens 1@S and your RHO overcalls 2@c... you pass, LHO passes, and pard reopens with a double
Using just the rule of 10, do you pass?
You have 1 trump trick. 10 -8 = 2, so you do not have enough stuff in trumps to pass

But suppose that RHO had overcalled 2@d 
Now, you have 2 trump tricks for sure, 10 -8 = 2 
So your trump holding IS strong enough for a penalty pass

EddyHaskel: So you don't count shortness in pard's suit as a likely ruff and count two "likely" club tricks? Just the sure ones
mitche: Nope. I expect declarer will try to pull trumps as soon as he can. I need very probable trump winners. 
And we still have the rule of 12 to go over

The rule of 12 deals with trump LENGTH
When you are considering passing a takeout X and converting it to penalty, add the number of cards you hold in their trump suit to the number of tricks they are trying for. 
If the number is at least 12, then you have enough trumps to pass.
If the contract is at the 1 level, 12 -7 = 5. You should have at least a 5 card trump suit to consider passing
At the 2 level, 4 trumps, and at the 3 level. 12 - 9 = 3 trump cards. 
That plus the rule of 10... 

Note that we are discussing JUST trump holdings for considering passing... 
Let's go back to the example hand: @sx, @hQ10x, @dAJxxx, @cKxxx  - if RHO overcalls 1@S with 2@c
We have 4 trumps, 12-8 = 4, so we are OK on the rule of 12, but the rule of 10 says, 10-8 = 2 sure trumps. 
We still may beat 2@c a trick, but if we passed, we should not be surprised to give up  -180|
pg| ***** 166 ***** |


nt||fp|1|cp|2|at|^b@2

mitche: OTOH, we have 5 trump cards in diamonds, and we have 10 - 8 = 2 sure trump winners. 
We should be able to beat 2@d enough to compensate us for any positive score we would be entitled to by declaring. 
And note, we don't have a fit for either major...

So that leaves just one other question - if you have the misfit and meet the requirements for both the rule of 10 and 12, should you pass a takeout X?
My rule of thumb is: Assuming pard's takeout X shows full values (sound opening bids), that's enough. If you open light, I would like 1/2 quick trick (an outside K or more) to pass  at the 1 or 2 level.
So the sample hand (x, Q10x, AJxxx, Kxxx) has both the rule of 10 and 12 met, plus 2 outside cards. This means that even if pard opened light, I would expect to have enough to beat 2@D.
Putting it another way - we reasonably can expect to have the balance of strength (10 + pard's 11 or 12 HCP minimum) to be reasonably confident of a set of 2@d, but not 2@c or 2@h

EddyHaskel: Do these apply only to pard's direct seat takeout doubles?  Not balancing seat doubles, I assume?
mitche: These can be used over takeout doubles or when you might be making a penalty X of your own. 
If pard is doubling in the balancing seat, add 1 full Quick Trick to the strength requirement - 
pard's balancing X has already bid about 4 of your points for you

That plus the rules of 10, 12 requirements..

OK, that is about it for this evening - once again, thanks for your participation! Have a great week, root for them Crows in the Super Bowl, please, and  Enjoy!
