^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |

^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

mitche: Hi, everyone and welcome to tonight's 2 over 1 bid, play and discuss session.
2 over 1 means: 
If your partner opens in first or second seat and you bid a non-jump 2 level bid, it is game-forcing.
Also if pard opens 1@H or 1@s in first/second seat, your response of 1NT (with no intervening bid) 
is forcing for 1 round .  Otherwise, the bidding looks a lot like SA|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||at|Kib:  Mitch, do you use reverse Bergen with 2/1? And do you use Drury?
mitche: I prefer regular Bergen, not reverse because you need the game invite more over the weaker response
Yes, 2-way reverse, but any Drury agreement is useful. 
There are very few 2/1 GF auctions: 
1@S- 2@C, or 1@S-2@D, or  1@S – 2@H or  1@H - 2@C, or  1@H - 2@D or  1@D – 2@C (and Jac2NT of course)

pg| ***** 14 ***** |


sk||pc|d7|at|mitche: Bidding: Modern style is to open all hands that fall into your NT range, 
as long as it has no singletons and at most 1 doubleton
So opening 1NT on S hand is pretty standard; 
That said, there is a second school that says it's OK to open 1NT with a 5 card @H suit, but not with 5 spades.
Check with your pard. 
I  like 1NT on S hand|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: And N has 8 HCP and a very upgradeable @C suit, 
so North feels OK inviting with 2NT.
Now, let's say that S decided to accept the invitation ....
She should rebid her 5 card major at the 3 level... 3@S here
N will now have to decide whether to bid 4@S or 3NT 
(my preference is 4@S, because Kx works well as support for a good 5 card @S suit).|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||at|gypsy1308: and I will pass, if I had 3 spades, I would go to 4@s
mitche: Eleanor, your 2NT invited. 
And your partner's 3@S (hypothetical) bid accepts the invitation, 
so you really are supposed to go to the best game.
So that is 1 way to handle a 5 card major in the NT opener's hand|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||at|But the problem is that S has a minimum opening 1NT, 
and she should content herself with playing in 2NT.
To accept, opener has to have a good 16 or 17 points. 
And S has a minimum 15 HCP + 1 more point for the good spade suit.

up|45|pf|y|at|mitche: Now, on to play: W led her 4th best @D (the 7) to the ace. 
What did E return at trick 2?|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


at|
The 3
When you win the Ace (or king or queen at trick 1) and you decide to return the suit (correct here), 
you should lead a card that gives PRESENT COUNT. 
In other words, E has the 53  left after winning the Ace.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt||at|Present count is 2, so lead the 5, top of a doubleton
Since S cannot possibly have had a singleton small diamond and bid 3NT, 
West can work out that E started with either @DA5 or @DA53
But the 3 says started with doubleton diamond, singleton left. 
Sometimes that information can be essential to proper defense|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt||at|And more on trick 2.. 
When declarer played the 8, West climbed with the K and played the Q
What would have happened if E actually started with A3? 
What would West think that S held in diamonds? 
She would conclude that S had J854 and was false-carding with the 8

sk||pc|sk|at|mitche: Bidding: If your hand is relatively balanced, it's tough to enter the auction after 1NT opener
And balancing after 1NT requires shape...So passing out 1NT seems pretty normal
The vulnerability being what it is, N would be either vary brave or very dumb to bid 2@S over 1NT
And to be honest, I am not brave enough to bid 2@S with N hand :)

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Now, let's look at the defense.
The @SK is as good a lead as you will ever make.. 
Now, S played the @S9.. I think that it's appropriate to show attitude rather than count here. 
That is Mike Lawrence's defensive style. Eddie Kantar recommends count. 
Both methods have plusses and minuses. But whichever you choose, you need to discuss it with partner|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt||at|Now, N played off the Q and J 
(you may consider playing the @S10 at trick 2, showing a 4 card sequence)
Declarer ducked and at trick 4, N was left with the @S107
They are equals, since there aren't any other spades left (except the Ace, which S can see)
N would like S to lead a heart if she ever gets in because the @HK looks like an entry 
to North's last spade|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


nt||at|How could N tell S to lead a heart?
sebstar: Lead the 10
mitche: Right.
You can't say "lead a club" or "lead a @D", but you can say "I like hearts", 
and your highest spade says that you would love pard to play a heart, not a club or diamond|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: As a matter of practice (it doesnt matter here) 
I would like declarer to get into the habit of playing "high card from short side" 
and to drive out the @CAce with the king.|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


nt||at|altak38:  Shouldn't declarer take the 3rd spade rather than wait till the 4th?
mitche: Declarer can win the second spade.. 
If spades are 5-2, then south will be out of spades after 2 leads. 
And if they're 4-3, then you cannot lose more than 3 spades.|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


nt||at|Basically, subtract the number of cards you hold in the combined hands from 8. 
The number you get is the round you should win your only stopper with... 
8-6 = take second round
There may be other considerations (like blocking a suit), but that is the standard rule. 
Or you can subrtact  from 7 and get the number of rounds you should duck .. |
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


nt||at|BILAsst10: Just 2 different ways of saying the same thing
mitche: So you win the second round of the suit  (7-6=1 => duck once = take second trick)
OK... 
when S won  the @CA and shifted to the @DQ, declarer should lead a heart toward dummy, not cash the @DAK

pc|ha|at|mitche: Bidding: My friend MaryAnn Dufresne has a really good book, "Bridge with bells and whistles" 
And she says in it, "don't tell the same story twice"
So let's see what story or stories got repeated, which ones weren't told
1@D is fine and 1@S is, too|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: I kind of think East might prefer 2@C to 2@H. 
Which suit do you want led?
ecolodge:  I do want the @C led, but also thought you bid the @H as a major first
BILAsst10: Dont you bid the higher ranking suit first? 

mitche: Second, when E bid 2@H, what message can S convey?|
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


nt||at|She can say "I have 6 diamonds" 
or she can say "I have 4 clubs"
I think 3@D is correct.
3@S does not tell West's story. 
I would bid 4@s instead of 3.|
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


nt||at|You have 7 of them, an outside ace in the suit pard had bid.. 
And you were going to bid it anyway, I guess, because  you did
So if you want to tell your story, bid 4... 
Anyway, West bid 3@S
Now South bid 4@D. She already said she has 6 of them, so that is an old story.|
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


nt||at|If she didn't bid 3@C, she should bid 4@C over 3@S-pass-pass.
Pard might have 4 or even 5 clubs (she didn't, but she might have)
So by repeating the message with 4@D, S loses the chance to find a better fit.|
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


nt||at|So the point is: 
When S bid 3@D, she announced a minimum hand w/ 6 diamonds, 
and 4@D didn't help pard as much as 4@C could have... 
sebstar: So S could've ended up playing 4 clubs? 
mitche: S could have, it if was right. Obviously, N will correct to diamonds (S showed 6 of them)|
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: It turns out that 4@S will fail on best defense (2 diamonds, heart, and trump)
But I think 4@D gave N the idea that maybe 4@S would make 
(if S has 7 diamonds, then there's just 1 defensive @D trick), 
so she took out insurance by bidding 5@D, 
thinking the  penalty would be smaller than E/W would get for making 4@s
And I think N was right to take the 5@D push, given the auction we had. Even with her 4 card spade stack...

pc|sj|at|mitche: Bidding: I think N has enough to open 1@C and to rebid 2@C if she has to. 
If you recall the "rule of 20" or my "rule of 22", this hand is a minimum opener. 
It has 2 quick tricks, 12 HCP, and 10 cards in its 2 long suits = 24
Or if you count losers, it has 6 .. Either way, it should open 1@C|
pg| ***** 98 ***** |


nt||at|Now, let's consider S's bid over EAST's 1@C opener.
btour has 4 spades, 3 goodish hearts, and 6 diamonds. 
I do not jump to 2@D with such good support for the majors. 
Take away the @HK and I might bid 2@D, but even then, I would think real hard about just 1@D.  
Pard could have a major, and we might be able to make a very large number of spades or hearts...|
pg| ***** 99 ***** |


nt||at|btour: I considered the best of the alternatives   (!!)
mitche: But 2@D shuts off any conversation about the majors. And we really want to find major suit fits
So bid 1@D.        OK, South??
btour:  NO....unlikely to find spade fit......I want them in spade fit...or hearts
mitche: Well, suit yourself.|
pg| ***** 100 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: You don't know they have a spade fit, btour. 
btour:  no I do not know, but I know pard is not going to change the suit unless she has 5 @S's
(mm: That's nonsense, pard will bid 1@h or 1@s with a 4-card over 1@d in a heartbeat)
mitche: I would prefer double to 2@D.. but 1@D doesn't bar pard from bidding spades on 4 of them|
pg| ***** 101 ***** |


nt||at|I have told this a dozen times before, so excuse me for telling the same story again ... 
I worked with world champion Lew Stansby many years ago, back in California.. 
I gave him a hand and asked him what he'd bid (expecting him to come up with my "master bid") 
He did not. His advice to me: "Mitch, I just bid my hand and let pard make the hard decisions"
btour, bidding 2@D is not biddng your hand. It is operating .. 
OK -- enough..

So 3@D is reasonable over 1@S, even at this vulnerability...
East's reopening 3@H bid was right, and W has a pretty clear raise to 4-- 
with the @DK behind the preempter, it looks to be a winner, and the major suit cards all are working
And the 5th heart is also a valuable card. So 4@H is very reasonable.|

The problem is that most people treat 3@H as forcing here. 
If you play that 3@H shows sound values, I would double negatively, even with 5 of them.
The West hand has 8 losers. That is an absolute minimum for a free bid at the 3 level 
(check that losing trick count article).|

nt||at|A negative double shows the unbid major. 
It may or may not have an unbid minor. 
(2 places to play)
If E bids 4@C over a neg X and W doesn't have them, he can bid 4@S. 
A considerate partner won't bid 4@C unless he has either a very strong 4 card suit or 5 of them.. :)

up|28|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: S has a bit of a problem with his Opening Lead. 
I think the @DA is about as good as anything else.. 
When S continued with diamonds, East discarded a spade on the king. Better is to ditch a club.
Why?|
pg| ***** 133 ***** |


nt||at|Since S is vulnerable and N passed, it's not impossible for him to hold the @CA. 
And with the clubs being a "frozen" suit, best to assure that you have just 1 loser in it
Especially since the spades may not behave as nicely as they did.
So discarding a club pretty much assures the contract, as long as nothing else gets ruffed

sk||pc|sq|at|mitche: Bidding: I would open East's hand 4@H, not 1
coupkoo: Losing trick count - should E open 2@c?  8 1/2 QT
DonnaS: Usually not good to open a 2 suited hand 2@c|
pg| ***** 141 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: The E hand is so offensively-oriented, I would just blast off in hearts. 
If W has the @CAQ, then I might miss a slam,
If I am using a big club system with asking bids, I would open 1@C but in standard bidding, I would not open 2@C
As it is, E/W can make 6 hearts, but it can't be bid
So I open 4@H.|
pg| ***** 142 ***** |


nt||at|If N/S get to 4@S, West might find a double... And collect only 500. 
After 1@S, W should pass. No bid describes her hand. 
2@D should a) show a longer suit or b) a much stronger one.
The auction won't end with 1S, and West does not like bidding anything at all.
msphola:  What about 1NT?|
pg| ***** 143 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: With this hand, 1NT is possible, 
but I'd much rather wait for pard to reopen with a double and defend, if that's how things develop. 
realrowdy:  Should south sacrifice?
mitche: If E opens 4@H, S might bid 4@S, and W will double. East should not pass with 8-5 shape

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: a @h slam here depends on a 3-3 club split AND not the lead of @HA and a second heart...
So slam is around 25% or less, I think,,, 
If W has @CAQ and @SA, then west might find a call.. But ....
bidding freak hands is frequently a guessing game. 
btour:  but huge reward at imps :)|
pg| ***** 158 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: or a huge loss.. the rule of thumb at IMPS is to bid a slam only if it has more than 50% chance to make.
Reason: going down in slam costs you a game swing. 
So the risk has to be such that you gain more on average than you lose. 
And that works out to about 55% vul, slightly more nonvul|

nt||at|mitche: OK, that does it for this evening. 
We need to thank the computer for such interesting deals, Eileen for her generous assistance, 
and all of you for your courteous attention and  participation.
Hoping to see you all next week. Happy Autumn!
I recommend finding a beat-up or new copy of "bridge with bells and whistles" by MaryAnn Dufresne. 
It's a great read for intermediates|
