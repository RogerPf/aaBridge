^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
He’s been mentoring in BIL for 2 years and lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

He learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|

^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

mitche: Hi, everyone and welcome to tonight's 2 over 1 play and discuss session.
2 over 1 means: 
If your partner opens in first or second seat and you bid a non-jump 2 level bid, it is game-forcing.
Also if pard opens 1@H or 1@s in first/second seat, your response of 1NT (with no intervening bid) 
is forcing for 1 round .  Otherwise, the bidding looks a lot like SA|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||at|92612:  Mitch, do you use reverse Bergen with 2/1? 
And do you use drury?
mitche: I prefer regular Bergen, not reverse. 
Because you need the game invite more over the weaker response
Yes, 2-way reverse, but any Drury agreement is useful

pc|ha|sk||at|mitche: Bidding: The 2@h bid looks pretty standard, 
with a decent 6 card suit and not much else to mention
South's and West's passes seem normal, too 
That brings me to 2@S. I certainly don’t mind 2@S, but after 2NT, I might just risk 4@S.
Reason - pard rates to have some points for the bid, and the N hand has just 5 losers 
(change the @DK to the @CK and 4@S is cold...)|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Should S bid 2NT after 2@S?|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


at| 
I would not fault her for passing 2@S,
kyno40: all depends if you play the 2@S forcing or not 
mitche: In this situation, where partner balances with a non-jump over a weak 2, 
you should have either a fit (doubleton) or a couple of kings to bid.  
South's hand has 8 points - but  it also has 8 losers...|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: The only forcing bid over 2@H is a cue bid.  
A double is takeout, and a jump to 3@S should show a good 6 card suit and about 15-16 points 
(or 5+ loser hand)
If N had as much as the additional @CJ, I would have jumped to 3@S with her hand

up|41|pf|y|at|mitche: OK - on to play 
When West plays the @H9, East had to decide if it was a singleton or doubleton. 
She guessed to treat it as doubleton and shifted to the club - unlucky!
Once she does that, the defense cannot take more than 3  tricks
dee_dee_20: the @h8 was missing so played it as doubleton|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt||at| mitche: Note that anything but the club shift holds declarer to 9 tricks.. 
dee_dee_20: I didn't want to promote the @hQ, was hoping  I could find P with @cA
mitche: I understand- but you may reason as follows: declarer needs to get to dummy to cash the @HQ. 
If she has the @DA or the @CK, then your play of the @HK might blow a trick
Anyway, the @C4 was just an unlucky play ...

pc|c7|sk||at|mitche: Bidding: The third seat 1@C bid is OK- so would a third seat 3@C bid have been OK
< especially at matchpoints
Why?|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


at|
N has not got a very good hand, but the vulnerability is favorable, and most important, N has reason to believe that EW have a major suit fit|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So keep that thought - 
In third seat, with favorable vulnerability, a preempt may be very useful
Here, it would have put E under a lot or strain. 
If East bids just 3@S, West is really under the gun - 3@S may be just competing, 
and West could be offering 500 if he bids 4@s
So the preempt is a good idea|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt||at|Marilyn516: Does W have a limit raise?
mitche: Now, in the actual case ... 
South's neg X is probably going to work as well as anything.. 
2@H would have shown a better hand,  so that and 2@D is out.
Over the double, West decided to cue bid to show a limit raise or better. 
I think that it is very, very aggressive to bid 2@C here |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: because: 
a) the hand evaluates to a bare boned 9 points - and that is a stretch
The hand is not quite a Bergen 10 by the way: 
The 5th heart is worth a point, but this suit is not a quality suit. 
And the 2 doubletons are not as useful as 3-1, so just be careful treating this as a Bergen 10
In any event, after 2@c, what should N do?|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Note that best defense will beat 3@C  4 tricks 
(@DA and another @D sets up a ruff for West)
While E/W would not be likely to double an opening 3@C bid, they may be very willing to defend 3@C doubled
So N should pass - a double would show stronger clubs, not necessarily 6 of them

up|44|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: When S led a club, all of North's clubs were equivalent. 
She should play the @C8.
When the 8 forces the @CK, S knows that N has the @CQ thru 8
And BTW, Dee-Dee, you can win the @CA to keep at least 1 defender guessing about the location of the king|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: At tricks 2, 3 East crossed to dummy and led the @SQ, 
covered when E led a second round of spades, she led the @S5. 
Better - lead the @S9
If S had the 10-4 remaining, she might have been tempted to cover the 9.  
She should not cover the @S9, but defenders have been known to do stranger things
In any case, it doesn't hurt to try to induce a cover|

pc|ht|at|mitche: Bidding: Over 1@D, I think I would have bid 1@H with the S hand.  
A simple overcall may be made on this kind of hand
I guess S did not want to lose the S suit
Marilyn516: Do I really want a heart lead?|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: A 6 card suit to the Q109  and an outside ace is plenty for an overcall, 
especially when you consider that you also have a singleton!
You may want to declare a heart contract
Pard will not lead a heart from an unsupported ace (except Ax), so you won't mind a heart|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


nt||at|petskosnet:  Could S bid a pre-emptive 2@H?
mitche: No, S should NOT preemptively bid 2@H - 
a) the suit is not good enough, and 
b) she has a defensive trick outside the suit (@DA)
A preemptive jump overcall should be relatively disciplined; the suit should be 3 of top 5 honors and no outside A|
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


nt||at| mitche: in the actual bidding, however, S passed and the E/W auction proceeded normally to 3@C
West should correct 3@C to 3@D, tho
Why?|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


at|
marikaSz: @D could be longer
mitche: exactly right! 
Marilyn516: doesn't she show 5/5 here?|
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: East has 5 clubs - but she bid @D first, so she must have at least 5 diamonds, and possibly more
East showed 5/5 or maybe 6/5
We all agree that East showed at least 5/5 - but she bid @D first. 
With 4/5 and a weak hand, E passes 2NT. So East must have at least 5/5
The auction tells W this information about the E hand, and so W should bid 3@D over 3@C

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: 2 points.. 
When East led the @SJ from her hand at trick 4, it is essential for S to show count in the suit
If she does, then N will be able to hold off on the @SA until the second round 
and get out with either a club or heart
This will kill the dummy completely and force E to lead diamonds from hand. Unless E guesses to lead small diamonds twice, she will lose 3 tricks in the @D suit|
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: point 2:
This is something you only come to realize thru practice - when you are defending and you have a trump winner, as N did, it is frequently a very good idea to win it as soon as you can. 
Reason - if you allow declarer to decide when you win that trick, you may find yourself being endplayed with it
So N should have played the @CJ when she was in with the @SA to bury the 10, set up the 9, and prepare to get out with a heart...

at|mitche: Bidding: West's hand might want to double 1@D  
What's that, you say? What if East bids clubs!
If East is 3334, then too bad. 
Any other holding, he will have either a 4 card major or 5 clubs (work it out!)|
pg| ***** 105 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Some people use "equal level conversion" doubles.. But in any case, W may want to double
East's double as a passed hand (even at this vulnerability) is very, very risky.
N/S are in a "live" auction, where N could have as much as an 11 point hand and S is unlimited|
pg| ***** 106 ***** |


nt||at|
At matchpoints, you may live to tell the tale, but at IMPs, I would wait for partner to balance ... 
A passed hand double should have about 10 points or so -- note this is not a balancing double.
East could pass a double if he passes the rule of 12 and 10 (we discussed that last month - it is in Klinger's book, 100 bridge tips, I think the title is)|
pg| ***** 107 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: I think that West should bid 3@H instead of 2@H when she has the chance.. 2@H is rather an underbid.

up|49|pf|y|at|mitche:  Play: If S plays the @SJ at trick 2,

Play it out - If N plays a spade at trick 3, what will S lead at trick 4?|
pg| ***** 122 ***** |


nt||at|BILAsst10: Except that North doesn’t know South has the @CA and if not may not get S ruff.
mitche: Where are South's points? West has the @DK (for certain. S won the A at trick 1), and the lead of the @SJ probably denies ownership of the K and Q
So what else can S have? Hearts and the @CA|
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: The point is that the bidding and early play tell N that West has spade strength and the @DK
So S must have strength in Hearts and /or Clubs
That is probably a very important thing to discuss, Eileen .. thanks ...|
pg| ***** 124 ***** |


nt||at| mitche: And that is, try to use the high cards that get played to place as many points as you can. 
The @DA put the @DK in West's hand
The @SJ almost guarantees that W has the KQ, - with the @SQJ, S would have led the Q, 
and with the KJ, S would almost surely have led either the K or small...|

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche:  Play: After the @H suit gets cashed at tricks 1-3, 
I think that leading the thirteenth heart should be played only when the defenders know the trump suit is breaking very poorly for declarer - 
Leading into a triple void should be done to try to promote a trump.. or when declarer has no losers outside trumps|

nt||at|kat827:  If W bids 1NT, does  E have enough to bid 2@S?
mitche: If W bid 1NT, East is forced to bid. He should bid 2@C
A 2@S rebid over 1NT would show 6 spades and a minimum opener (15 or fewer HCP)
East might well have decided to open his hand 1NT, by the way, instead of 1@S. I would have.

up|36|pf|y|at|mitche: But now on to play: Once we get to 4@H, what should W lead? 
Without the hint from the auction, I would have led my singleton @D
Leading the @CA works when East has club shortness. 
But given that S had bid 2@C, I would not have been so eager to release the @CA|
pg| ***** 168 ***** |


nt||at|
After N wins the @SA at trick 3, she led the @HJ and finessed
What do you think of that play? I do not like it at all
Suppose that the finesse loses to the doubleton @HK
What do you think West would do? She would lead another club, which would get ruffed, that's what 
BILAsst10: so just play Ace and give up last trump?
mitche: Right!!!|
pg| ***** 169 ***** |


nt||at|If the finesse loses, the contract could go down, right???
The ONLY way the contract could be defeated is for S to lose a finesse to the @HK
Taking the finesse wins an overtrick, +30 half the time. 
The other half of the time, the finesse loses 620. 
(actually, it's a bit better.. East could have been dealt a doubleton heart. Not likely, since West had 6 clubs)|
pg| ***** 170 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: So taking the finesse loses 295 points on average. Not taking the finesse assures +620 
Which would you prefer?
I thought so.. 
so is everyone clear why taking the finesse is a bad idea?

mitche: If you would like, we can discuss the 3-card limit raise in 2 over 1

Here is the problem:
When you raise 1@S or 1@H to 2, you promise 7-9 dummy points and a 3-card support. 
If you play Bergen raises (I think you should), 
then you have a problem showing the kind of hand N has on this deal:


{|ih|pSA62 HJ97 DAQ94 CT65|at|}|at|


A 3-card support and 10-12 dummy points
What is the answer?|
pg| ***** 173 ***** |


at|
Playing 2 over 1, you can use forcing 1NT to handle this problem. 
Responder bids 1NT, forcing

Here is the point I am driving toward .. 
How do you distinguish between 3- card and 4- card raises of 1@H or 1@S|
pg| ***** 174 ***** |


nt||fp|1|cp|2|cs|1|at|^b@2 

The usual way to do this is as follows:
a) with 3-card support and 7-9 dummy points, raise 1@H (1@S) to 2
b) with 4 card support and 7-9, use a Bergen raise to 3@C
c) with 3-card support and 10-12 HCP, start with 1NT (if you are an unpassed hand)
d) with 4-card support and 10-12 dummy points - if you are an unpassed hand, bid 3@D, Bergen 

e) If you are a passed hand, use DRURY (2@C) to show a 3-card limit raise (10-12 dummy pts)
f) If you are a passed hand with 4-card support and 10-12 dummy points, bid 2@D (Drury)

Opener's responses to Drury 2@C (3-card) and 2@D (4-card) limit raise passed hands are:

- If you opened 1@s weak in third seat, you rebid 2@S 

- If you bid 3@S, you are asking responder to bid game with 11+ or 12 dummy points
  (some people play 3@S rebid by opener as a general slam try. Check with partner)

- If you have a full opener with no slam interest, just bid 4 of your major.

- ANY NEW SUIT bid by opener is 100% forcing to game and is a genuine second suit; 
  It shows extra values and invites responder to control bid with fitting cards in the second suit

All of the fit-showing bids (3@C, 3@D Bergen, and Drury) 
are ALERTABLE and should be discussed w/partner before using them


(note movie maker: As some use Bergen reversed, some use Drury reversed)
This concludes this week's session.|
