^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||at|


^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

mitche: Hi, everyone and welcome to tonight's 2 over 1 play and discuss session.
2 over 1 means: 
If your partner opens in first or second seat and you bid a non-jump 2 level bid, it is game-forcing.
Also if pard opens 1@H or 1@s in first/second seat, your response of 1NT (with no intervening bid) 
is forcing for 1 round .  Otherwise, the bidding looks a lot like SA|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||at|92612:  Mitch, do you use reverse Bergen with 2/1? 
And do you use Drury?
mitche: I prefer regular Bergen, not reverse. 
Because you need the game invite more over the weaker response
Yes, 2-way reverse, but any Drury agreement is useful

sk||pc|d2|at|mitche: Bidding: Please notice East's pass over 2@H .. This is the correct bid here. 
West bid and rebid hearts, showing 6 of them.  
And since it was 2@H, her hand is limited to about 14 points or maybe a terrible 15
So East judged that there was no game, and 7 card fit had been found. 
So her pass was correct, even though she has 11 points
Some people might think to bid 2NT, and here that might have worked well, but with game unlikely, stop bidding!

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: OK - on to play: Declarer made a nice play by leading a low heart at trick 2 - 
she might have tried playing a spade to dummy and finessing the @H, but that is unlikely to do much good
Even were S to hold the doubleton @HK, then N would score a trick with the 8 or 9
mitche: Well done|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: One final point: when N led the @D6 to give her partner a ruff, S returned a club. 
Even though the low @D says "please lead a club" there were 2 clues that something else would be right
First: the only @D S had not seen was the 9, and had N led it, the @D8 in dummy would have been established
Second, and more important, the club was away from the jack and into the KT9..|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt||at| If N had a ruff coming, it would have meant she started with a singleton ace, 
which she might have led, and also, it would have meant declarer started with 4 clubs... 
In which case, she might have bid 2@C instead of 2@H

pc|h3|sk||at|mitche: Bidding: A note on "semi-forcing" 1NT
S was a passed hand, and so her 1NT was NOT forcing 
(some people play that 1NT is forcing, even by a passed hand, but I think that is not the best idea)
North has a minimum opening bid, so she decided to take her chances with clubs and pass.
If N/S use Drury or any of its variations, this is OK, because N doesn't have to worry about missing a spade partial or game.
If south had spade support, she would have bid 2@C (or 2@D, depending on the flavor of Drury in use) to show a goodish hand w/ spade support|

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: On to the play: When West won the second trick with the @HA (lucky heart lie for the defenders), she should just play a third heart to set up her suit.
Declarer may decide to double-finesse spades (and should) but West should hope that she has an entry in diamonds or spades. 
Also, please note that when the hearts are established, W becomes the "danger hand", so S must finesse into the East hand. 
In any case, I think the best defense is to continue hearts... |

pc|s4|at|mitche: Bidding:
a) I think that I would have opened the W hand with 1@H. 
Why?
It has a decent 5 card suit and 2 1/2 quick tricks. 
And it meets the rule of 22 (length of 2 longest suits + HCP + quick tricks)
So West wants to open 1@H 
eleno59:  Is that for all seats?|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Yes West's hand opens 1@H in any seats 
East's 4th seat weak 2 is less clear-cut to me. 
If you agree that her hand is what you preempt on, then OK - but many people play that a 4th seat 2 bid shows a 6 card suit and 5 or  6 losers
That said, I would be more inclined to open 1@S than 2, especially at this vulnerability
If second seat (west this time) is expected to have full values for an opening bid, then 4th seat must "protect" i.e. open light, just in case W passed with 12 points|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: East's hand is a 7-loser hand, perfectly OK for third or 4th seat 1 bid, I think
Check with your partner on what 4th seat 2 bids mean. Any agreement you have is better than no agreement!
Marilyn516: If W opens 1@H, what is east's bid?
mitche: If W opens 1@H, East should bid 1@S|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


nt||at|Lola8888:  yea - do u bid the Spades or support the hearts?
mitche: I would think the auction should be 1@H - 1@S
South might double 1@S for takeout, but if she passes, then E/W should continue 1NT – 3@S
At this point, W should raise 3@S to 4@s
East also has a sound 6 card @S suit. 
If W bids 3NT, then E should bid 4@H|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: yes, you should raise to game, especially vul. 
The game bonus is worth taking a shot at. 
You have aces and kings, and they are undervalued cards in the 4-3-2-1 point count  method
EW will have a pretty good shot at game, since they can set up the @H suit to absorb a potential second @D loser|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Someone asked what should happen if E opened 1@S
West will now bid 2@H, which East might raise to 3, or she might rebid her spade suit
If E bids 3@H, then they get to 4@H, which may fail in a @D lead, but otherwise it makes easily|

Because: a) remember, W passed, so S has no way to know about the heart suit
b) the @H lead is safe whenever pard has either the @HK or the J.. 
c) a trump lead guesses the trump suit for declarer... OK??

pc|ha|at|mitche: Bidding: After 1@D, 2@C, things got a bit strange. 
The negative double on 6-4 shape is problematic, and East's hand is a shade too weak for the bid. It has no defensive tricks, so bidding now may get you in serious trouble.
I would pass and await further developments.
Lola8888:  with 6 spades, topped by an honor, I figured someone had to have spades, and since my P opened - there was a good chance it could be her|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: 2@H over the negative X promises at least 5 cards. Some people also play that the bid shows tolerance for partner's overcalled suit
So 2@H was fine. 
mitche: 2@S on a 3-bagger, even after the negative X is taking your life in your hands,  ... 
calligal: Yes, but I figured they bid clubs and hearts and I had @D so it had to be @s's   LOL
mitche: If you bid at all, I'd rebid my 6 card @D suit, but the best alternative is just to pass.
|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Each of N and S could easily have 1 more spade, 
so you could be in a 4-3 fit and by all rights, it should be a 4-3 fit.  Finding East with 6 spades on a negative double is really  lucky
But since W doesn't want to get to the 3 level on a potential misfit, best to pass and wait for things to develop
And they will|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: After the 2@H bid, N might try 2 or even 3 notrump
And if he does, then partner will correct to hearts
4 hearts fails only because the hearts are splitting 4-0 !
I think the auction might be 1@D (2@C) pass,(2@H)/ pass, 3NT - 4@H.
mitche: Klaus said he thinks 3NT makes.. it takes 6 club tricks, 3 hearts, and either a spade or diamond, depending on the lead...|
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


nt||at| The problem is, with a 7 card suit, S will not let you play 3NT - or should not
So this bidding got very complicated
After bidding clubs and hearing S bid hearts, N should have a fitting honor in hearts to bid NT|

pc|sq|at|mitche: Bidding: I think the bidding was as it should have been
After the takeout double, old-fashioned players would have passed N's hand
Modern style is to ignore the takeout X, and bid as if the doubler had passed - except for the availability of redouble, which means "10+ points" 
If you use "Jordan" convention, then redouble also says "no good fit for opener's suit"
So the bidding was as expected by all|
pg| ***** 112 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Jordan is to use a jump to 2NT to show a limit raise or better of opener's suit (after the double)
So 1@S  X   2NT = a hand like Qxxx, Kx, KJ10x, xxx or better|

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: The @SQ worked out OK for opening lead, as pard held the @S10
At trick 2, when declarer played the @DJ, east covered.
This could cost a trick in a variety of ways
First, if defender ducks, the @DQ will almost certainly win a trick because declarer has no way to finesse again
Second, while unlikely, West might have a singleton A or K|
pg| ***** 127 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: And if declarer has AK10xxx, you are never getting more than 1 trump trick anyway.
So East has to resist the temptation to cover an honor with an honor ...
And declarer : when you do win the ace, you are missing the K98
kyno40: I would have thought E only has KQ of @D
mitche: So playing the 10 can't be right. If the K is singleton, your play promotes 2 trump for the defense, and if the king is doubleton or tripleton, it doesn't matter which diamond you lead|
pg| ***** 128 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: These card combinations happen often enough that you might want to google bridge card combinations or look in the encyclopedia of bridge (which has hundreds of "standard'  combinations)
One final point on card play - When the @HQ won at trick 9, East should not try the @HK. 
Either a low club or a low heart is better
Because partner MUST have 2 of the @HA and a club honor for her double. Count points!|

sk||pc|d5|at|mitche: Bidding: If N/S are using new minor forcing, then N might bid 3@C at his second turn, just in case S has 3 spades
It is unlikely that S has 4 hearts. Because if he did, he would probably have bid 2@H instead of 2NT at his second turn
As a note: if S were 4/4 in the red suits, he should not reverse – 1@D followed by 2@H should guarantee 5 diamonds... |

up|32|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: When diamonds were bid on your right, as they were here, West should have a much stronger suit to lead them, something like QJ10x 
I think the @CJ is right here.. 
On a club lead, the defense gets in with the @HQ and @DA to set up clubs. 
Also, declarer can not set up either spades or diamonds, so the defense will probably defeat 3N|
pg| ***** 147 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: The point on opening lead is: 
If RHO bids a suit and later declares NT, you need a really strong holding to lead that suit. 
Otherwise, you are essentially taking a finesse against  yourself

fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f What to do after a Take-out Double  }|
fp||cp|9|cs|3|ht|e|at|^b@2Mitch: 

When your partner opens (especially 1 of a major) and your RHO doubles, it's important to show a fit when you have one.
So if I have a 3-or 4-card fit I will show it. 
An immediate raise says "3 cards and a weakish hand" 
e.g. after 1@S, if I have Qxx, xxx, Kxxx, xxx I raise to 2@s

How many of you play or know Bergen raises?

So if you play Bergen, this is important: after a double of 1@H or 1@S, BERGEN RAISES ARE OFF!!!
Marty invented a convention that he calls "BROMAD" - Bergen Raises Of Major After Double
Here is the idea:

With a "constructive" raise, i.e. 7-9 dummy points, and a double of 1@H or 1@S, 
you use 2@C to show 3 card support and 7-9 dummy points
And 2@D shows 4 card support and 7-9 dummy points

Example: Jxxx, Kxx, KJxx, xx
If partner opens 1@H and your RHO doubles, playing BROMAD, you bid 2@C
If partner opened 1@S, and double on your right, you bid 2@D

That leaves 1 other case where you want to raise: 10+ dummy points and a fit
(well, it also leaves the really weak 4 and 5 card raises, and I'll get to them, too) :)
If you happen to have a hand like this: K10xx, xx, Axx, QJxx 
you are too strong for a BROMAD 2@D over 1@S X right? 
So what do you do?|
pg| ***** 150 ***** |


nt||at|^b@2

Conventionally, the auction 1@S (or 1@H) double 2NT says, "I have at least a limit raise of your major"
Because space may be limited, I think that 3 card support is also acceptable for the Jordan 2NT

BILAsst10: not everyone agrees - not saying right or wrong
mitche: Eileen's point is well-taken. I use 2NT to show 3 card support with ruffing value.. 
Otherwise, the redouble gets overloaded
We'll get to that in a moment

Almost everyone uses the raise to 3 of a major after X to show 4 card support and 0-6 HCP 
(and a singleton is highly recommended for that jump, too)
So 1@S X 3@S shows something like J10xx, xx, xxxxx, Qx or thereabouts. 
It is a really trashy hand with support
And 1@S X 4@S shows something like this: Qxxxx, x, Jxx, qxxx  or so
It is important that you have some distribution for the jump to 4S here. 
Depending on vulnerability and suit quality, you may decide to play it safe by bidding just 3@S 
on a hand with 5-3-2-2- shape

So yes, I would say the jump to 4 almost always shows a singleton, or maybe 5422 with a halfway decent 4 card suit, 
e.g. Qxxxx, xx, K10xx, xx
But do not be surprised if your leap gets you -500... |

nt||at|^b@2

One other thing to mention. 
If your pard opens 1@C or 1@D and you have a 7 point hand, you should find some action
Example: pard opens 1@D and RHO doubles - with QJxxx, xx, Jxx, Kxx, I bid 1@S
You do not promise a 5 card major, but you do suggest a suit that partner can safely lead from 
(assuming that her holding is not an unsupported ace, of course!)

And that leaves just one more case: you have a good hand with no good fit for partner
Example: xx, Axx, KJxx, Q10xx
Over 1@S X, your action is to redouble!
Your redouble says, "We have the balance of strength" and it suggests very strongly that you are interested 
in a penalty double of anything they bid.. |
pg| ***** 152 ***** |


at|

If you have a good enough hand to redouble, and your LHO passes your partner will pass with a semi-balanced hand 
and wait for the doubler to rescue himself
Then you get your penalty X in, most likely
If opener is unbalanced, he will bid a second suit

Example: opener has 5-2-3-3 and it goes 1@S  X  XX  pass
He passes too and waits for LHO to move|
pg| ***** 153 ***** |


at|
If doubler passes, you expect to make on brute force
If doubler guesses to bid partner's 4 card suit, he should double.
If not, he will pass or bid NT... 

Example: your hand was 5-2-3-3 and doubler reopens with 2@H.
If pard doubles 2@H, it is business. 
If he passes, you are expected to do something clever - 
either double or bid a second suit or NT, if you have hearts stopped

I am known at the club for finding the worst possible auction in competition.
The way I learned declarer play was by winding up in horrible contracts :)
You know, like missing my 5-4 fit to play in a 3-2 fit ---|

OK, getting back to the discussion .. 

It takes some experience to judge when to double or when to push to your own contract
General rule of thumb: 
At IMPS, be willing to push to game UNLESS you can see a probable 2 trick set of a part score 

mitche: I don't like trap passing.. 
Sometimes it works very well, but more often, you trap partner. 
btour:  well with 8-12 you get to hear from dblers pard
mitche: Bob, here is what happens when you pass.
The opponents get to find their fit, and when you back in , they get a "fielder's choice" whether to bid on, take a save, pass, or hammer you.








This concludes this session
I hope you enjoyed, Karen10
