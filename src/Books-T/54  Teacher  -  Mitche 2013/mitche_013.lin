^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
He's been mentoring in BIL for 2 years and lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

He learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|

^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

mitche: Hi, everyone and welcome to tonight's 2 over 1 play and discuss session.
2 over 1 means: 
If your partner opens in first or second seat and you bid a non-jump 2 level bid, it is game-forcing.
Also if pard opens 1@H or 1@s in first/second seat, your response of 1NT (with no intervening bid) 
is forcing for 1 round .  Otherwise, the bidding looks a lot like SA|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||at|92612:  Mitch, do you use reverse Bergen with 2/1? 
And do you use drury?
mitche: I prefer regular Bergen, not reverse. 
Because you need the game invite more over the weaker response
Yes, 2-way reverse, but any Drury agreement is useful

at|mitche: Bidding: Even if you play Bergen raises, responder's hand is pretty depressing, and I would probably bid just 2 spades.
92612:  because of the 4333 shape? 
mitche: yes, the 4333 6 point hand is so ratty, I would not bid 3@S (preemptive) 
or 3@C, constructive Bergen raise.
When responder raises 1 to 2, S has a hand with 6 losers. The single raise can be on as many as 9 losers, so S should content herself with an invitational bid, rather than just  blasting into 4@S

up|37|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: Here is a hint on opening leads: 
The opening leader's LHO showed a weakish hand with 2@S, right?
And RHO bid game in spite of that weak response, so the opening leader's RHO rates to have all the strength.
So unless you have a really clear honor lead, leading away from a King is almost as bad as leading away from an ace.
I would lead as passively as I can, and I might guess to lead a small club, on the basis that it isn't giving declarer anything she can't get on her own.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt||at|irinica:  top of nothing?
mitche: On a club - declarer has to try 2 finesses, trumps and diamonds. 
Most people lead top of nothing, but that is a matter for partnership agreement. 
See Kantar's book on defense.|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt||at| 
(note mm: quote ^*BKantar Opening leads against suit contracts:^*N 
"Holding xxx in an unbid suit. This is a toughie. 
If you lead high, it looks like a doubleton; if you lead low it looks like low from an honor. 
If you lead the middle, nobody knows what it looks like.
Best is to avoid leading from xxx if you can help it. 
Experts tend to lead low from three small, but for the rank and file, "top of nothing" is better."|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Oh, yes, one other point: 
When you are missing 3 trumps to the king, you are better off in the long run to take the finesse than to bang down the ace. 
Today declarer got lucky - but the King is twice as likely to be in the hand with 2 trumps as it is to be in the hand with 1

sk||at|mitche: Bidding: a strong 2@C bid shows one of 3 types of hands: 

a) strong, balanced 22+ HCP (or whatever is bigger than your opening strong 2NT)
b) a 1-suited hand with 4 or fewer losers
c) a "game in hand" unbalanced hand  (game in hand = 3 losers or fewer)
Example: AKQJxxxx, Ax, KQx, void|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: South has a hand with essentially 2 losers, assuming any kind of fit with diamonds
Normally, I really disapprove of opening 2@C with 5/5 or 6/5 shape, because you have too much stuff to find out.
But this hand is so strong, S may as well bid 2@C|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt||at|Lola8888:  can you talk about how else it could/should have been bid, please
mitche: If she opens 1@H, she may miss a cold slam if pard has as little as the @DQ and the @SQ
So what should the auction be after 2@C?
What should N do?
Lola8888:  I expected a 2@D - waiting|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: A positive response shows a good suit (at least KJ10xx) of 5 or more cards (2/3 or 3/5 top honors) ^*BAND^*N 8 points
So 2@s is not the best bid for N. 
I would bid 3@C to show the strong club suit and extra values
After 3@C, South may bid 3@H and over 3@S, she could jump to 5@D, which might get 6@D from N
2@c-3@c/3@h-3@s/5@d-6@d|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Note that 6@D makes if declarer guesses the @D suit - or if a spade isn't led (declarer ditches 2 spades on the @CAK)
If S is willing to contract for 11 tricks, N may think that her hand is worth a raise to 6
I would...|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt||at|irinica:  is 2@D ever a positive response?
mitche: It could be a very good hand.. 
Example: Axxx, Axx, xxxxx, x bids 2@D, not 2NT
If pard has a hand with at most 4 losers, then 2 aces should guarantee game, and if a fit is found, slam is likely - but responder doesn't have a positive response|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt||at|Lola8888:  Isn't there also some kind of code responder can use to tell about aces, after a 2@C bid?
mitche: You can use a number of structures for responding 
(e.g. controls, or 2@H response to show hand without an A or K), 
I prefer keeping things very simple and use 2@D for any hand  ...
I recommend looking at Howard's site. I think he has a writeup on 2@C openers
I think that controls or 2@H super negative are alertable, but positive responses, as long as they show the suit bid, are not alertable|

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: West has a very difficult opening lead (OL) decision. 
Leading a small trump here is very bad, since it will pickle any honor  the OL's partner has
A spade is out, and clubs were bid naturally. 
I would have led the @DQ |
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: The fact that diamonds were the unbid suit persuades me to lead that card. 
NS did not bid NT, and neither of them bid diamonds, so that is my reasoning for leading a (losing)  diamond... 
Too bad for me!
Sometimes you do the right thing and it blows up on you|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: BTW, on the club lead, I would have cashed the A and K, and I would guess to discard the spades
Then, if diamonds and hearts behave reasonably, I make 12 or 13 tricks.
You see? My diamonds will win 4 tricks anytime the suit splits 3/2 and the @DQ fails to fall.
And I score as many hearts as I can

at|mitche: The East hand is spades and spades and more spades
With an 8 card suit, 2@S is kind of conservative. I would bid at least 3@S, 
to take away as much bidding space from the opponents as possible
With equal vulnerability, I would have bid 4@S with the E hand
I don't know that I would have bid 3@C over 2@S (my choice would have been pass)
But 5@C is reasonable when pard rebids the suit

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: OK - here is the thing in play .. recall that West showed up with a singleton spade right?
That puts 8 spades in the East hand
So when declarer plays on trumps, there are 5 cards in the East hand that might include the @CQ
And West has 12 unknown cards which might include the @CQ
So the odds are way better that West has the @CQ than East does.
So the way to play the clubs is to win the @CK at trick 4, then play the @CJ and finesse|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Finally - when you finish the trumps in 3 rounds, 
play the @DAQ before you ruff a heart. 
Then you can discard one of the losing hearts on the @DK and ruff the other one
You need to look to see when you use your entries to dummy (or your hand). 
If you use them too soon, you may strand a winner, as happened to the diamond here

She does not want N to get the lead and shoot a heart thru the king to the AQ
If S wins, the @HK is still safe from attack, so the finesse was correct|

mitche: Opening lead? none are good. A spade is as good as anything. 
Leading a heart from AQxx blows a trick, and since you have just 4 of them, you do not gain a return for the trick you give up on lead.
Leading small from AQxxx is usually pretty good, but it's not as happy a lead from AQxx|

^b@2From: ^*BEddie Kantar in "Modern Bridge Defense"^*N

"Whenever you lead from an AQ combination there is a good chance the K is on your right. You are basically conceding a cheap trick to the declarer. If you don't lead the suit, declarer can not take a trick with that King. If you are going to give up a trick, you want to get something back for your money.

When you lead from AQxx, the most you can get back is 3 tricks, and even that is iffy; one opponent may also hold 4 cards in the suit, etc.
However, when you lead from AQxxx, you stand an excellent chance of establishing 4 tricks (if pard has the J or if pard gets in and returns the suit). Leading from AQxxx is one of the better leads against NT; leading from AQxx is not."

East doubled after passing to show support for the unbid suits, just in case W has a strong distributional hand
West might have bid 5@C at this vulnerability, hoping to hold her losses to -500. 
(and in fact, she does not. Best defense beats 5 clubs 4 tricks)
So passing was the right thing for West

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: If you plan to play the @SAK (as you should), then you might want to do that before you cash the @HA
You ran the risk of having one of your winners ruffed, with no particular advantage or compensation for taking the risk
And East did double to show heart length....

sk||at|mitche: bidding: 
a) whereas on the prior board, East's double with a hand worth only 10 points was a good idea 
(Judy was a passed hand), here North's double is  not such a great  idea. 
North has a  weak hand (only 8 HCP) and not a very shapely hand, either.
If I were South, after the double, I would have bid 3@D and hope that I don't miss 3NT
The double here should show a pretty sound opener because both opponents have bid and your partner has passed, even non-vul

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play Declarer ruffed a diamond and then crossed back to hand to ruff a second diamond.
At that point, she played hearts. Better is just to play on trumps. You plan to score 
the @DA, 2 ruffs, the @HAK and 3 or 4 trumps in hand, and the @SA
That is enough to make the contract. But playing on the side suits, you might see a winner ruffed. 
Since N has so few HCP, you should expect her hand to have more shape, and the @HA is a prime candidate for being ruffed|

sk||at|mitche: bidding: first - the negative X promises 4 card support for any unbid major
That is as close to an absolute as exists in bidding
So S may as well bid 1H
Palaiseau: do I need 5 cards to bid 1@H?
mitche: Since there are 2 unbid majors at the time, the 1@H bid does not promise 5 of them
And if S promised 4 spades, then N should have bid 2@S instead of passing.|
pg| ***** 178 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Would I open N hand? no
The "rule of 20" says - add HCP and lengths of your 2 longest suits. This comes to 19, and you do not have good suits, either, so pass looks right
Well, in third seat, maybe, I would relax the bidding requirement a bit
as long as you are not 4333, 11 HCP is enough in third seat.|
pg| ***** 179 ***** |


nt||at|
mitche: Reason for 4th seat only: in third seat, with 2 passes, the possibility is that 4th hand has a good one... so my third seat opener is designed to get a bid in, while the auction is at a low level

South's 3@C should have been based on at least 4 card support.

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play East has a choice between the natural spade Q from a 3-card honor sequence or the singleton.
I think the spade makes more sense, since it will help build up tricks. 
The heart will work only if I can get a ruff, and if I do ruff from Qxx, it may be at the expense of a  natural trump winner anyway,  So I go for the attacking lead here.|
pg| ***** 194 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: West did well not to return a heart when in with the @CA, since if he did, E would have been ruffing a loser.
OK -let me thank you all for your courteous attention and also BILassist Eileen for her generous assistance!
