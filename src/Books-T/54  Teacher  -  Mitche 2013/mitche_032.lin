^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||at|


^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

mitche: Hi, everyone and welcome to tonight's 2 over 1 bid, play and discuss session.
2 over 1 means: 
If your partner opens in first or second seat and you bid a non-jump 2 level bid, it is game-forcing.
Also if pard opens 1@H or 1@s in first/second seat, your response of 1NT (with no intervening bid) 
is forcing for 1 round .  Otherwise, the bidding looks a lot like SA|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||at|92612:  Mitch, do you use reverse Bergen with 2/1? And do you use Drury?
mitche: I prefer regular Bergen, not reverse because you need the game invite more over the weaker response
Yes, 2-way reverse, but any Drury agreement is useful. 
There are very few GF auctions: 
1@S- 2@C, or 1@S-2@D, or  1@S – 2@H or  1@H - 2@C, or  1@H - 2@D or  1@D – 2@C

sk||pc|s5|at|mitche: Bidding:  Let's see how N/S might have gotten to their cold 4@H contract.
First - when S raises 1@H to 2, she showed 4 card support and about 6-9 points. 
So now, N has a hand worth 17 HCP AND it has 2 doubletons, so that's worth something 
- call it 1 point (or maybe 2); 
AND the good 5-card club suit is worth another point, so N hand  is worth about 19 total points at hearts|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||at|gypsy1308: I only took 17  
mitche: Please reread the comments - 2 doubletons = 1 point at least, 
and the good club suit is worth at least 1 extra point , 
so N has a hand worth 19 total points!
If you never count distribution points, you will never be able to get to very good games|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: You MUST (repeat -- MUST) learn the value of your distribution
So 6+19 = 25, and North has a relatively comfortable raise to 4@H instead of a very conservative 3@H bid, which would show about 16 points or so
mitche: ....  anyway - I evaluate the N hand as being worth 19 points.  So I think N should just bid 4@H
But N just bid 3 (showing about 16 or a really ratty 17 points)|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


nt||at|Now, South can add her 9 points in high cards to 16 or 17 to get to 25 or 26, 
so she should ACCEPT the invitation to game. 
So either player could have bid game, and both of them should have

up|52|pf|y|at|Mitche: Now, let's see how declarer may have planned the play:
She sees 1 potential spade loser, 1 possible trump loser, 1 or 2 diamonds, and if clubs don't split 3-3, a possible loser there, too
When the spade is led, declarer may think "I might be able to win a trick with the Q to make the spade loser go away"
If E led away from the @SK, then I can play the Q at trick 1 and my spade loser goes bye-bye|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Therefore, N has a lot to gain, and nothing to lose by playing the @SQ at trick 1
If the @SK is with West, the Q won't ever win a trick, so playing the Q can never lose and might win|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt||at|
(mm: west will "insert" a card (J or 10) and keep the Q covered, driving out declarer's only card higher than the 5
Only if west can not do this,  when west needs to play the K, will the Q take a trick)|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: The key point: If West has the K, then the queen can't ever score.
Notice that West MUST have one of the @SJ or @S10 
If East had the J and 10 without the King, her proper lead would have been the Jack.
With the @SKJ10, the book lead (at least Kantar's book on defense) is the @S10 - a "coded" lead
So declarer's chance of having the 9 force out the king is nil|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: One bidding question: 
Should S have responded 1@D or 1@H to 1@C?
Modern style is to skip over a 4-card @D suit if you don't have enough strength to force to game, 
So S should probably bid 1@H 
This is a point you and your partner must discuss. 
Some people play "up-the-line", and that is perfectly OK, (well, it's OK)|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Molly's point on point count is sort-of-correct. 
Suppose that we made Liza's @D suit a bit stronger, like AK109 instead of the actual K1095
Then her hand would be worth 13 HCP and would be strong enough to insist on game opposite an opening bid.
Then, she would have bid 1@D - and if opener bids 1@S or 1NT, 
Liza's hand would be worth a 2@H (well, more likely a 3NT) bid|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: bidding 1@D as responder promises diamonds and 6 points. You may have a hand like xx, Jxx, KQxxx, Qxx
Then you would rebid 1NT over opener's rebid of 1@H or 1@S, or you'd just pass 1NT
FM75:  After 1@C-1@H   1NT?...  3@H? What should opener rebid?
mitche: Fred - after 1@C - 1@H/ 1NT by opener is a minimum hand, denying 4 spades, 4 hearts, and at most 14 HCP

(mm: denying 4 spades depends on your style)

sk||pc|c8|at|mitche: Bidding: Let's start with a discussion on what S should do after 1NT
There are 2 very commonly-used defenses over 1NT. 
DONT, invented by Marty Bergen, and Cappeletti, invented by a guy named Fred Hamilton and made popular by Mike Cappeletti 
You should learn both of them.|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: But here is the point they both agree on: 
You need some good distribution to bid over 1NT
Bergen makes the point much more emphatically. 
He does not allow a double to be made on a balanced hand - ever!
So no matter what N/S have agreed to play, South's hand is worth a pass|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Yes, it has 15 points but so what? 
Unless West has an absolute bust, South will be endplayed every time she is on lead
We can discuss defenses over 1NT after the deals tonite if you like

(mm: see section after hand 5)|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Anyway, South did double, and now West has to decide what to do
Cliff decided to bid 2@D, which he intended as a transfer
Many pairs play "systems on" after either a double or 2@C
In this case, Cliff's hand is probably useless as dummy against 1NT, so he bid 2@D on the gamble that 2@H would do better than 1NT doubled
2@H is always headed for down 1, but best defense would beat 1NT  by 2 tricks|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: I prefer to use DONT over strong NT and Cappeletti over weak (11-13) NT
analisals: I have been told by a respected teacher on BBO that east should not open 1NT with this exact distribution?
mitche: Should East open 1NT? I would. Even with 15 HCP, the 2 aces and 2 kings and decent @S suit are enough compensation, I think, for the minimum hand, I would not devalue the E hand and  bid 1@C|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Should N double 2@D?
What do you think? Does N want diamonds led?
gypsy1308: I was hoping my X said she stole my bid
mitche: ^*BThe double of an artificial bid says, "please lead this suit, pard"^*N
And I think that at a minimum, you should have length (which N does) and one of the top 2 honors in the suit, 
and 2 of the top 3 (i.e. KQ or better)
So N should probably let S choose her lead.|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt||at|If you double an artificial bid when YOU are going to be on lead, then I think it depends on partnership understandings. 
I don't know of a standard meaning other than "I have length and am willing to sacrifice against a game contract"

I don't know how good an idea it would have been for W to transfer absent the X
I would have, and I would be ready to apologize if opener had a weak doubleton in hearts|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


nt||at|Cliff228: Can never get to my hand with two small hearts
mitche: Can't get there more than once with 3 small, either
Unless someone has doubleton AK

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Liza decided to lead a club -- 
I think a better lead is the @SQ because 
a) she has a nearly-perfect 3-card sequence, QJ9  
b) it is a MAJOR, and we generally like to attack with majors  against NT
She might have led the @CK, but on balance, I think the spade works out better most of the time|

up|42|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: Since dummy is short of entries, I might duck the @HJ opening lead 
and play the @HK under the ace, should W play it. 
That may make an entry out of the queen
In any case, declarer needs to get to dummy to lead something- a trump, most likely, so |
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


nt||at|she should NOT play the spade ace and then finesse, but rather, lead toward dummy's K -
If she wants to finesse, that's OK, but the important thing is to try to use the K and J of spades as entries
Spades might break 3-3, but I think I can gain 2 tricks by leading twice from dummy, 
so I will give up on the 3-3 break and play the spades by NOT cashing the A|
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: It also saves at least 1 trick for declarer to play that way, since the defense will get just 1 ruff, not 2
Also, when W ruffs the spade and leads a club - N should play the @CK - 
West needs the @CA to justify his 1@H opener (count points) and by winning the K, 
she can play a round of  trumps and hope to avoid 2 spade ruffs

nt||at|mitche: NOTE: the auction 1@S - 1NT/2@H promises at least 4 card heart suit.
The auction  1@S - 1NT/2@C may show only a 3 card club suit
With 5 card major, balanced, bid 2 of your better minor... |
pg| ***** 110 ***** |


nt||at|The only problem hand is when opener is exactly 4-5-2-2 and on a minimum AND responder bids 1NT over 1@H
In that case, lie and bid 2@H

Repeat after me: Responder will never bypass a 4 card major to bid 1NT|

mitche: After 2@C, S can pass. She has 4 clubs and just 1 spade, so she knows she is in a 4-3 fit instead of a 5-1 fit.
2NT was the right shape, but about an ace and a 10 light

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: S can see 5 sure winners, 4 clubs and the @DA 
She should play for down 1 by leading a little spade toward the K 
(hoping east has the ace and is napping or that west will have to  make a friendly lead, eventually)
And in any case, S should not block the club suit.|
pg| ***** 126 ***** |

Rather, she should cash the high clubs from the short hand (AJX) 
so when the third round is won in hand, she can cash the  remaining club.. and then lead a heart toward the K

sk||pc|hj|at|mitche: Bidding: If you play DONT, the S hand is almost strong enough to double 1NT and then bid 2@S 
(see tonites lesson)
As it is, 2@S is very reasonable, given the vulnerability
West's distribution warrants bidding, but it's hard for her to get in over 2@S 
unless E-W have an agreement on how to deal with interference.|
pg| ***** 134 ***** |


nt||at| 
I use the Lebensohl convention, where  2NT is a relay and forces 3@C from East. 
West can then guess either to pass or bid 3@H
But without that convention in place, west is best off passing, 
which will give up a small minus most likely rather than to risk a bigger one

up|44|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: the @HJ lead tells east that declarer has the @HKQ, 
so it's safe to duck the opening lead. 
Declarer won the heart (better to win it with the King - east knows where the @HQ is, but West doesn't) 
and led a LOW spade. |
pg| ***** 148 ***** |


nt||at|This is a give-up play. 
East is odds-on to hold the @SK  because the 1NT bid would be pretty thin without it.
So she should finesse a diamond at trick 2
Then the @DA will be an entry AND the diamond suit will be set up, to boot.|
pg| ***** 149 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: One more point for declarer.. 
When East won the @SK and cashed the @HA (don't do that!), she then led a small club. 
The bidding tells us that East has to have that @CA to justify 1NT opener. 
If East is marked with that card, S wins the @CK and then discards a losing club on the @HK 
That is why east must not cash that @HA too soon

fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^i DONT  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|^b@2DONT stands for "Disturb Opponents No Trump" and it is based on these 2 ideas:

1. If you have a 5-5 hand (or a good 5-4 hand), you can generally do well to declare, 
even when your opponents open 1NT|
pg| ***** 152 ***** |


at|

2. You can put pressure on the opps by making it harder for them to find their best contract - 
if you pass, they will get it right almost all the time|

So Marty came up with DONT
It is essentially a way for you to get into the bidding with either a good 1-suiter or a moderate 2-suiter
Here is the structure:

- First, ^*Ba double^*N of 1NT shows a ^*U1-suited hand^*N (and it should be a pretty good suit)
Example - RHO opens 1NT and you  hold xx, KQJ10xx, Axx, Kx
double 
If everyone passes, lead a heart and hope to beat 1NT by a trick or two
(I will get to what pard should do later .. promise!)
You promise a pretty good suit and some stuff|
pg| ***** 154 ***** |


at|

-If you have a ^*U2-suited hand^*N, e.g. Q10xxx, xx, KQxxx, x 
(notice, this is a very weak hand, but its shape is magnificent)
You bid the ^*BLOWER^*N of your two suits
So a bid of 2@C promises clubs and a higher ranking suit
A bid of 2@D shows diamonds and a major
A bid of 2@H promises both majors|
pg| ***** 155 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2


So what does 2@S mean? What is the higher suit? Obviously there isn't one! 
So 2@S means "spades" and spades alone:  
Usually a 6 card suit, but if you are dealt a halfway decent suit and an outside K or so, 
something like AJ10xx, xx, Axx, xxx, you may bid 2@S

Remember - your goal isn't necessarily to go plus .. 
but rather to disturb the free flow of information between the opponents
Notice that this is the set of actions you take when ^*BRHO^*N opens 1NT

- One other call.. some people bid ^*B2NT^*N to show ^*Uthe minors^*N
Then a 2@C bid is clubs and a MAJOR

I prefer that a 2NT bid show 5-6 or so in the minors, 
so that I can bid 2@C on a hand like x, xxx, Q10xxx, KJ10x|
pg| ***** 156 ***** |


at|

Marty Bergen says that a 2@S overcall can be made on "real junk" with favorable vulnerability, 
something like KJxxxx, xxx, xx, xx
Marty bid like crazy until opponents figured out how to deal with featherweight overcalls...|
pg| ***** 157 ***** |

OK - so now, on to ^*B4th seat^*N 

Suppose your LHO opened 1NT and partner made a DONT bid.|
pg| ***** 158 ***** |


at|
If partner ^*Udoubled^*N 1NT, he advertises a 1-suited hand 
Most of the time you can guess what that suit is by looking at your hand. 
IF YOU HAVE SOME SCATTERED STRENGTH IN 2 OF THE SUITS PARD PROBABLY DOESN'T HAVE...|
pg| ***** 159 ***** |


at|
PASS
Example: 1NT   ^*uX^*N   (RHO passes)    and you have   @sQ10x  @hx  @dKxxxx  @c10xxx => ^*Upass^*N
Pard has hearts (almost for sure) and an outside A or K, probably 2 
Where are declarer's tricks? You will go for the throat and look for a 2 trick set.|
pg| ***** 160 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

But most of the time, when pard doubles, you will not have enough to convert to penalty. 
1NT-X-pass-2@c
So you will run to ^*B2@C^*n
This says nothing about your clubs, only that you want partner to be able to bid his long suit
Your hand is    xxxx, J10xx, xx, xxx. 
You MUST bid 2@C and let pard pick the trump suit|
pg| ***** 161 ***** |


at| 

There is 1 exception to this rule to bid  2@C 
If you have a good 6 card major of your own, you may bid it. But it had better be pretty good!


If LHO bids over the double, you should find out what they're playing. 
Almost every pair has some counter to DONT, be it Lebensohl, or stolen bids or snapdragon or systems on...
So you'll bid appropriately.  
Most of the time, you'll pass and let pard make the final mistake  :)  
But also, most of the time, RHO will pass too. 

If partner makes a ^*U2-suited^*N DONT call:|
pg| ***** 162 ***** |


at|

a) You have ^*U3 cards^*N in the suit he bid: ^*BPass^*N (or raise with 4 card support).  
If you have a strong hand, you may look for game, but remember that partner possibly has a "weak freak"|
pg| ***** 163 ***** |


at|

b) If you have ^*Ufewer than 3^*N cards: bid the ^*Bcheapest suit in which you have at least 3 cards^*N.
Pard will pass or correct to his second suit.
Sometimes you will have to scramble or play in a 5-2 fit. That's life!|
pg| ***** 164 ***** |


at| 

c) When you have a ^*Ufit^*N, bid as high as you can as fast as you can, using the ^*BLaw of Total Tricks (LOTT)^*N. 
Which says you are (usually) safe to bid to the same level as the total number of trumps you and your partner have.
This is why DONT requires 5-5 or a very good 5-4 hand to bid. 
Your partner is expected to push the bidding with a fit!|
pg| ***** 165 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

Now, about ^*uX followed by 2@S^*N

I have asked Marty what he considered the minimum hand to double and then to pull to 2@S
And the hand he sent me was   @sKQ109x  @hAx  @dKJx  @cKxx
In other words, X followed by 2@S is a very serious attempt to get to a spade (or occasionally NT) game 
after RHO opens 1NT
