^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||at|


^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

mitche: Hi, everyone and welcome to tonight's 2 over 1 play and discuss session.
2 over 1 means: 
If your partner opens in first or second seat and you bid a non-jump 2 level bid, it is game-forcing.
Also if pard opens 1@H or 1@s in first/second seat, your response of 1NT (with no intervening bid) 
is forcing for 1 round .  Otherwise, the bidding looks a lot like SA|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||at|92612:  Mitch, do you use reverse Bergen with 2/1? 
And do you use Drury?
mitche: I prefer regular Bergen, not reverse. 
Because you need the game invite more over the weaker response
Yes, 2-way reverse, but any Drury agreement is useful

sk||pc|c3|at|mitche: Bidding: East's 2NT was "unusual", showing length in the 2 lower unbid suits, 
in this case hearts and clubs.
The bid is useful, but as with any other convention, it has its drawbacks. 
If you don't buy the contract, you frequently give declarer a complete roadmap to the play of the hand|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Also, unless you and partner discuss how strong your hand is, 
you'll never know whether to defend or declare.
I suggest that 2NT shows either 0-10 points, or 14+ HCP. 
And when you have the 11-14 hand, you bid your two suits
When 1@D opened, @H and @C are the 2 suits 2NT shows
Which is what wayne has|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: If N opened 1@S or 1@H the minors are the 2 lowest
When 2NT comes to S, she has a pretty good hand. 
If you aren't using "Unusual over Unusual", the common way to show a good hand is to double. 
Wayne_LV:  esp with good defensive values in one of the implied suits
But she bid 3@D, which was passed out|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||at|Wayne's point about defensive values is sort-of correct. 
You should have concentrated strength in your two suits, especially if you are in the low range of the bid
realrowdy:  Does the X show spade stopper?
mitche: I think that double says: "10+ HCP"
And then you can decide whether to punish the opponents or bid on... 
realrowdy:  6 of my points are in Wayne's suit
mitche: I use "unusual v. unusual", where double says "I can punish one or both of their suits"

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: OK - on to play: Wayne's opening lead isn't my choice. 
Leading from KJ when the opps have the balance of strength is almost sure to cost you a defensive trick  
(or Q 10, for that matter)
So Wayne should not lead a club. What should he attack at trick 1?|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: My choice is the @SA and hoping pard has an entry to give him a ruff
Cliff228: I'd lead the ace, followed by the @HQ, here, it wouldn't work very well
mitche: Well, honestly, nothing works here. N/S will make at least 9 tricks against any defense
But the point here is that the club lead loses much more often than not. 
If Wayne wants to let declarer do all the work, he can lead a trump (giving away nothing)

pc|c9|at|mitche: Bidding: The neg X  showing 4 spades and about 6 points minimum is correct.
Next.. The 4@H bid, non-vul is pretty good idea. 
With lots of trumps, a singleton, and a weak hand, this is the "book" bid.
What should S do,  knowing that E/W have a big, big heart fit and pard has spades?|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Since S doesn't know how good N is, pass is probably correct
Change the @HQ to a small one and make it the @SQ, and I bid 4@S.
Another common theme: If you have (wasted) strength in their suits, they probably have strength in your suit
So that makes 4@S a bad idea on the actual hand S held|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: North's bid.. without a trump trick, double is a bad idea. 
So 4@H should be the final contract.

up|32|pf|y|at|mitche: On to the play: Opening lead: 
The @C9 looks very much like a doubleton, so if I don't lead a high diamond, 
I would not lead the 9 from 3 small clubs
If I were to break the suit, I would lead small from 3 small   (pards suit, unsupported) 
But I would lead the @DA|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Pard plays small, and then you can lead a small club.
S wins and returns a diamond to your K, and then you lead a second club, killing the king... 
It did not matter here, as declarer doesn't have a useful discard
But you should want to lead from AK rather than 3 small...

pc|s4|at|mitche: Bidding: OK - if the 1NT range is 15-17, 
then N can tell that the maximum number of HCP in the partnership is 25
Next, N knows that N/S don't have a long suit.
So without a long suit, S would need a maximum for her to bid 3NT, and if she doesn't have one, 
then 2NT may be too high.
With an absolutely flat hand, I think you need a slightly better hand (9 points) to invite game|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Especially when your longest suit lacks an honor. 
If N held, Kxx, Qxx, QJ10x, xxx, I might invite, since pard might be able to develop a long diamond
Yes, the N hand has a lot of 10s and 9's, but ... you still want to have a source of tricks, 
like a long suit with a picture to invite on 8

But she should not have the chance to.....|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


nt||at| When declarer was in dummy with the clubs (and no entries), she should lead a LOW heart and finesse the 10.
If it loses to the K, she's happy. 
If not, she can try to drop a doubleton K next 
And W knows that declarer was trying to set up hearts, so there is a reason for her not to lead one 
when in with the K

pc|s3|at|mitche: Bidding: I think that N is a bit too good to pass 1@C
If you can't stand double with the N hand (and then removing 1@D to 1@H), 
then N might bid 1@H
In any event, after the 1@S overcall, I think N should either double 1NT to show strength 
or bid 2@C to show a good hand with spade support|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Anyway, I think most people would treat 3@S as more preemptive than powerful
I dont know if East should bid over 3@S, even with her 5/5 shape and spade void
The vulnerability being as it is, 4@D is kind of pushy, 
especially since E has no reason to expect W to have either heart support or good diamonds|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: But again, if E had say a suit like Q10xxx instead of 9xxxx, I would bid 4@D
Marty bergen's favorite saying is "5-5, come alive", 
so it doesn't take much to get me to bid with that shape and especially with the void

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: play: With this hand, W thinks that N has ruffing values, so the trump lead makes sense.
Declarer has to figure out where 3 diamond losers and a spade are going to go.
She should reason as follows:
If I draw trumps, I am sure to lose a heart, spade, and at least 2 diamonds|
pg| ***** 102 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: But for that to happen, I should lead a small diamond toward dummy's K, 
hoping that the Ace is on my left
But even if the @D Ace is behind the king, East cannot return a trump, 
so I can ruff a diamond in dummy eventually|
pg| ***** 103 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: With that in mind, her play at trick 2 should be to lead a small diamond from hand
In fact, because the @D Ace is in front of the K, declarer can do both 
- win the K AND ruff a diamond|
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: This hand is a good test of declarer's ability to imagine how the play will proceed.
So - in summary -- West, nice opening lead. 
Declarer, count your losing cards before you play to trick 1, 
and see how you can dispose of some of them
Cliff228: would you double 1NT for penalty as north?
mitche: yes, except it is frequently used as a "romex" double, to show a high spade card

I think that the sequence 1@D – 1@H/ 3@C should show better distribution, but what else can she do???
So after 3@D, the problem is still there. 
3@H on 3 card support is, well, problematic|
pg| ***** 115 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Unfortunately, the best solution requires W to lie about her strength by opening 2NT, 
a solution I do not approve of. 
I think you are better off lying about your shape than your strength
OK.. so this is a nasty bidding problem, and 3@H showing delayed 3 card support is OK|
pg| ***** 116 ***** |


nt||at|peggyall:  thought of 2NT ...
mitche: Peggy, stop thinking about 2NT, unless you are playing IMPS and need a swing
btour:  After 3@C does East want to be in game?
mitche: Well, it depends on whether you think a jumpshift is game forcing or a 1 round force
maspd: What about bidding 2NT after the 1@H|
pg| ***** 117 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Without any way to check out in a part score, 
most partherships think a jumpshift is game forcing
2NT after 1@H should promise a spade stopper... 
It gets the points right, and you might live to tell the tale|
pg| ***** 118 ***** |


nt||at|maspd: sure P likely to have some and sometimes you have to hope they do not lead them
mitche: As Shakespeare might have said, "a stopper is neither weak or strong, but thinking makes it so"
There is another thought - if you are going to have to lie, pick the lie that if you survive, gives you the best result
maspd: Better to be in 3NT than a 3 level part score|
pg| ***** 119 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: I'd rate 2NT as about a 65 and 3@C as about the same 65.. 
Well, would East raise 2NT to 3? Probably
So flip a coin. Bid 2NT if you think you can get away with it 
(no one overcalled spades, so they may not be able to cash 5 spades against you, 
even if pard has 4 little)
maspd: when East bid hearts, West has 3 suits to run and has to hope N/S don't get to run spades or lead them

One point, Lisa, and that is -after the first 2 tricks, the @S 109 were both winners, 
so you may have made 4 by ruffing the losing club and cashing spades 
(N ruffed with the @HJ so the 10 was a winner)

sk||pc|c7|at|mitche: Bidding: After 3@S. what should East do?
She knows that E/W have at least 35 HCP, so a small slam is very likely to succeed
But what slam?
I think her next bid should be a natural and forcing 4@D
After the 4@D bid, West should bid a natural 4NT.
Why is 4N natural?|
pg| ***** 146 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Because 
A) West limited her hand with the 2NT bid, so East MUST be the person to make the slam try
B) West does not have a 5 card suit, and raising 4@D to 5 looks wrong on this balanced hand with much strength outside the @D suit
If W bids 4@H, East should interpret it as showing a heart honor and not an attempt to play in hearts|
pg| ***** 147 ***** |


nt||at|maspd: I think the 5@h bid was not right was it?
analisals: It wasn't, that is why I settled for just 6
mitche: Now, East should bid 5NT, which is "pick a slam"
And West should bid 6NT
West doesn't know if East has the @D Q or 5 running spades 
(take away the @S10 and you need exactly a 3/3 spade split to make 7)|
pg| ***** 148 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: You need to be able to count to 13 tricks to bid a grand. 
East needs to know about the @SJ, and W needs to know about the @SQ or @DQ
If you use Precision or some system where you don't need to open 2NT on big hands, 
you  have room to explore for the slam..|
pg| ***** 149 ***** |


nt||at| mitche: In any case, bidding to the grand when you start looking at the 4 level is a chore
One other problem: if 4NT was blackwood, I don't know what 5@H was - 
With 3 Key Cards for spades, I think the correct response is 5@D
OK - if you misclick, say so, and we can undo a bid...|
pg| ***** 150 ***** |


nt||at| mitche: Lisa asked who should be moving to slam .. 
West limited her hand with 2NT .. so East is responsible for getting E/W to slam
Cliff thinks that E should bid a grand if she knew that W had 3 aces; 
Presumably, he would ask for kings and discover the @CK, showing all the controls. 
Cliff228: 3 aces is only 12 HCP--has to have something else :)
mitche: So Cliff would sweat out that one of the suits would produce 5 tricks...

sk||pc|d4|at|mitche: Bidding: The textbook that recommends a 1@D overcall, vulnerable on West's hand has not yet been written
A vulnerable overcall shows a suit you want led and a minimum playing strength.. 
The @SK is a nice card, but it is in a short suit, where it does not very much good, 
and the @H suit is pretty anemic
OK - so 1@D was pretty gutsy.|
pg| ***** 172 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Now, what did 2NT mean over 1@D?
Without any other discussion, I would take it as 10-12 HCP, balanced.. 
Only problem with the bid is that it denies 4 cards in either major... 
kyno40: = @D stopper
mitche: Yes, Klaus, it also shows a @D card
OK - so once again, the question is whether your agreements allow you to bid 2NT with a bad 4 card major.  
I think it should not...|
pg| ***** 173 ***** |


nt||at| mitche: N will have plenty of chances to bid NT later, 
but just this one to show spades
But that is just my opinion for now... 
Anyway, 2NT should show 10 - 12 HCP 
South's 3@H reverse is quite nice, it shows 4@H and 17+ HCP
kyno40: I fully agree with you Mitch :)
mitche: Since N has promised 10 + HCP, it guarantees that they will get to game.|
pg| ***** 174 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Just 1 other point on bidding.. 
After 2NT, E should bid 3@D, even with her cruddy 5 count. 
A) it includes a singleton, and 
b) it includes a high honor in diamonds
Remember, east should credit West with a better hand, and her hand suggests that 3@D will play reasonably well|
pg| ***** 175 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: The K9 means that North's diamond stopper will be finessable.. 
(or it's their Ace, and then the 9 might be enough to assure that N gets just 1 diamond trick)|

up|20|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: Lisa correctly led her partner's suit, and correctly led the 4
When W won the @DQ and returned the 2 (better is the 5, your original 4th best, I think), 
Klaus should guess to play the 8, not the J
Perhaps W has Q109, and then the @DJ would force out the king...|
pg| ***** 183 ***** |


nt||at| mitche: It is the only chance N has to score a trick with the J.. 
If W had KQ109, she might have continued with the K .. 
But trick 4 is very telling in a number of ways.
West dropped the @CJ under the queen
At trick 5, North led the @C3 and East played small. N decided to finesse the 7
It won, giving him the rest of the tricks, but it was a very poor play.
at IMPS, anyway, it was a poor play.|
pg| ***** 184 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: If West had decided to falsecard with say the @CJ9, 
then he would have lost a club and 2 more diamonds and go down 1 in an ice-cold contract
At IMPS, it is a terrible mistake to risk a sure contract worth +400 or +600 for an overtrick worth 30 points.  
You need  pretty good odds to take that kind of chance, about 50-1 vulnerable, or 33-1 nonvul
There are mandatory falsecards, which are well-documented in the Bridge Encyclopedia

Mitch: 

OK - Here is the problem 2 over 1 players face: 
If you open 1@H or 1@S in first or second seat, and partner responds 1NT, you may not pass
Period. 
Pard could have any of a couple of dozen different hand patterns, including support, 
or perhaps a void in your suit.
Your first priority for rebidding after 1@S - 1N is to limit your hand's strength
Recall that a minimum opener has a maximum of 15 HCP, and an "invitational" hand has 16-18; 
a strong opener has 19-21 points

So your first rebid helps decide which range you are in:
A 2-level bid below 2 of your major shows a minimum - to - invitational hand
Rebidding 2 of your major says you have a ^*B6-card^*N suit and a minimum hand.

Example: 1@S - 1NT / and you have     KJ10xxx, Kxx, Ax, Qx
rebid 2@S

Next: If you have opened 1@S and you have 4 hearts (or more) you will usually bid 2@H with a minimum
There are exceptions - but for now, we won't worry about them

If you do not have 6 spades or 4 heart when you open 1@S, you will bid your longer minor suit
Sometimes, that will be a 3 card suit. Example  KJ10xx, Axx, xxx, Ax
Even tho it's very, very ugly, the correct rebid is 2@D - responder will know you may have a cruddy suit.

OK - how many points does that 2@D bid promise? 
You may have as many as 15 points.|
pg| ***** 187 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

With 15-17 and a balanced hand, you open 1NT - even with a 5 card major
So the 2@C or 2@D bid promises a minimum balanced hand. OR
You might have as many as a good 16 if your hand is unbalanced


Example:  AQJxx, xx, Kx, AJ10x   is a pretty decent hand, but the correct rebid is still just 2@C 
Some people bid 2@C with 2533. I am a NT hog, and if I have a stopper, I like to show it. 
But check with your partner. 

There is another reason for bidding a better minor .. if partner is on lead, he may get a better idea of what to lead... 

OK - so what does 1@S - 1NT / 2NT show???
Cliff228: too strong to open 1NT
mitche: With 20, we open 2NT - so this bid shows 18 points, or a very bad 19
Exactly right, Cliff -- it shows a hand too good to open 1NT
Remember that pard promises 6 HCP .. 

So the auction 1@S  1NT / 3NT shows a good 19, 5332 shape, and at least partial stoppers in every suit
It is NOT a shutout bid, since pard can still correct 3NT to 4 of your major with 3 card support and a ruffing value|
pg| ***** 188 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

Now, one other sequence: 
You open 1@H and partner bids 1NT
If you play Flannery (I hope you do not. Really), then 1@H - 1NT/ 2@S shows 4 spades, 5 hearts, and about 16 HCP
Otherwise you lose the spade suit. And that is really bad.. 
(now where did I put that blasted spade suit? Under the couch? is it still in the card holder???)


Now - let's suppose that you don't play Flannery.. 
then there are 2 ways to show a strong hand:
(other than raising 1NT to 2) 

- To show a strong unbalanced hand, you may reverse with 2@S over 1@H
(this may show any of a variety of hand patterns) 
- Or you may jump-shift into 3 of a minor.. 
But note, if you bid 3@C or 3@D over 1NT forcing you should have an unbalanced hand. 
Something like this:  x, KQ10xx, KJx, AQJx
This is about a minimum hand for this bid. 
Since pard did not bid 1@S, you either have a heart or a minor suit fit

Other odds and ends – 
1@S - 1NT / 3@S - shows an invitational (16-18) point hand with 6 spades
and 1@S - 1NT/ 4@S shows a 6+ card suit with about 19-20 points (just below a 2@C opener)
That is part 1 of how to rebid after 1@S, 1NT forcing

OK - time for me to look for that spade suit .. Have a pleasant evening, and once again, 
thanks to all of you for staying late


This concludes this presentation, I hope you enjoyed, Karen10
