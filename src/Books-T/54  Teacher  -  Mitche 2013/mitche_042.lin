^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

pg| ***** 4 ***** |

Let me begin with advice I once got from a pretty good player:
"I just bid my hand and leave all the hard decisions to my partner." -- Lew Stansby |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|

We open 1 of a major and partner shows support
 -either with a direct raise
 -or conventionally. 
Many times we can place the contract immediately, either by passing or bidding game.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at|

Example 1: 
@sQJxxx  @hAxx  @dAx  @cQJx - has no problem (and no further bid) when responder raises 1@S to 2@s|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|  

Example 2: 
@sKQJxxx  @hKxxx  @dx  @cAx  - raises 2@S to 4@S (Remember to re-evaluate this hand)
It started out as 16 points, and after the raise, it's worth 
16 + 2(singleton) + 1 for 6th trump + 1 for the outside 4 card suit = 20 points) |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|
Responder promised 7-9 support points so the partnership has 27 - 29 points, enough for game, but not slam. 
Alternatively, the hand has just 5 losers. 
Responder has 8 - 9 losers => the Losing Trick Count says you have at most a total of 14 losers,  
which when subtracted from 18 tells us we can, and should, bid to the 4 level.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||
cp|2|at|^b@2
Much of the time, we will need more information to get to the best spot. 
Here are some tools we have available to us:

a) After a simple raise (1@s – 2@S, or 1@H – 2@H) 
Opener will pass with 7+ losers (see example 1), bid game with 5 losers (example 2), 
and invite with 6 (- 7) losers by bidding a new  suit. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|

b) Opener rebids a new suit (non-jump) as a game try 
(by partnership agreement, this new suit is either a long suit, short suit, or weak suit. More later)|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


at|

c) A bid of 2NT by opener is forcing and asks responder for shortness.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|

d) A ^*Bjump^*N in a new suit (e.g. 1@S – 2@S / 4@C) is a slam try and shows shortness 
(we'll look at slam bidding later. There is a lot to cover. Bergen has a book on the topic.)|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


at|

I am now going to take a side-tour into an auction you need to discuss with partner: The auction 1 - 2 - 3 

Some pairs use this as a bar bid, designed to prevent the opponents from balancing, e.g.  
@sKJ10xxx  @hx  @dKQx  @cQJx
If the auction were to stop at 2@S, then smart opponents will balance and force us to the 3 level anyway. 
So we make the safe (according to the Law of Total Tricks) raise to 3@S to prevent the opponents from 
exchanging information.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|

Other pairs use this to ask responder to raise to game with any hand at the top of its range. 
Example: Responder has @sxxx  @hQxxx  @dKQxx  @cxx (8 ½ losers) - She passes the 3@S bid. 
But with @sQxx  @hAKxx  @dxxxx  @cxx (8 losers) she bids on to game.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


at|

A third way to treat this raise is to invite game only with good trump support (QJx or better). |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


at|

Recommendation: I like 1-2-3-Stop! 
But if you use this as a game try, it should ask responder to bid on only with an 8-loser hand, i.e. a maximum.
There's no room for confusion with either of these approaches. Any agreement is better than no agreement!|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

Next bidding topic, the so-called "help suit game try" (HSGT)

Bidding a new suit after a raise:

- Most pairs play this as a help suit or ^*Bshort suit game try^*N.
Opener typically has a long, weak side suit, something like Jxx or xxxx 
and wants responder to consider the help suit to  decide whether to raise to game or to stop in 3.|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


at|
Opener uses a help suit game try with an invitational-strength hand and a suit with 3 losers, 
for example:  @sx  @hAKJxxx  @dAKx  @cxxx. 
This 6 loser hand has a pretty good play for game opposite:  @sxxx  @h10xx  @dQxxx  @cKQx, 
but no chance opposite:  @sKQx  @h10xx  @dQxxx  @cxxx

So how does opener find out whether to stop in 3 or play in 4@H?|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


at|
If responder has help, she bids game.  What is help??|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


at|
First round control (Ace or void) is help;  KQ or singleton is help;  KJ10 is help;
With Kxx(x) or Q10x(x), or xx bid game ONLY with a maximum (for your 2-level raise) |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


at|

I want to make this clear: the WORST holding for help suit is xxxx.. 

Example 1: The auction was 1@S – 2@S and responder has  @sQxx  @hKQx  @dJ10xx  @cxxx
Question time: Which suit(s) would you accept a game try in?|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


at|
BILAsst10: only @h
Right! She raises to game if opener asked for help in hearts, 
but bids 3@S over a club or diamond help suit game try.|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

Example 2:  @sQxx  @hQ10  @dQ10xx  @cQx:  Responder returns to 3@S on all help suit game tries. 
(in fact, the responder's hand is so weak, I  would bid 1NT and then 2@S) 
Opener may have  invited on something like  @sAKJxx  @hAxx  @dKx  @cxxx

(MM: Earlier, Mitche stated with 6-7 losers a HSGT, this might be one of those 7-loser hands...?
but how often will responder be able to take care of 4 of your losers after responding 1@s - 2@s?
Even with @cAKx I doubt you want to be in game)

NOTE: 
If responder signs off at 3 of the agreed major and opener bids again, responder should interpret the bid as a slam try.|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


at|

Example:  @sx  @hAKQxxx  @dKx  @cAKJx,   - After 1@H – 2@H/ 3@C – 3@H/ 3@S 
Opener has shown a slammish hand and is showing controls. 
Responder, looking at  @sQxx  @hJxx  @dAxx  @cxxx  should cooperate and bid 4@D, 
and you will get to the good 27 hcp 6@H contract|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


at|

A final note:  
Some partnerships play 1@S – 2@S/ 3@H as a genuine heart suit (looking for 4-4 fit instead of 5-3 fit). 
Discuss that auction with partner!!|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


at|


I will skip short suit game tries tonight. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

Next is something you may want to play with a regular partner: ^*BOpener rebids 2NT^*N
 
(NOTE: this is not part of standard bidding and requires alerts from both opener and responder!!)

Suppose you open 1@S and partner raises to 2@S. 
You are not likely to want to play in notrump, so the bid 2NT is pretty useless as a natural bid. 
You can put it to use to ask partner for shortness.|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


at|

Example: 
1@H - 2@H/ 2NT says to responder: Please tell me about your hand.  If you have a short suit, please bid it. 
With no short suit (singleton or doubleton) responder bids 3@H 

Opener has  @sx  @hKQJxx  @dAKxxx  @cxx 
If responder has short diamonds, a single ruff may set up the suit (with 5 losers, opener is interested in game). 
Note that a help suit game try wouldn't be very useful here.. 
so having 2NT gives you a way to ask for what you need without distorting your hand.
|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


at|

^*BSelf-splinters:^*n

Suppose you have a game-going hand opposite a single raise, something like: 
@sAKJxx  @hAxx  @dAKxx  @cx 
You open 1@S and pard responds 2@S 
If her strength is in the red suits, something like @sQxx  @hKQxx  @dxx  @cxxxx you would like to get to slam. 
So you jump to 4@C to show a hand worth in the vicinity of 21+ adjusted points and club shortness. 
Responder MUST cue bid if she can (4@H here). 

Opener can then sign off in game or continue looking for slam if the control bid helps. 
In particular, responder knows that any club cards other than the Ace are probably going to be wasted. |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

ecolodge:  How do you know, Mitch, with a jump to 4@C that it is shortness or Gerber?

Well, I NEVER play Gerber after a suit has been bid and raised, so I don't have the problem.
If you use Gerber at all, I recommend that it's ONLY IMMEDIATELY after a natural NT bid, 
e.g. 1@D - 2NT/ 4@C or    1@H – 1@S / 2NT - 4@C

sk||pc|sk|at|mitche: Bidding:  West may want to bid 3@S over 2@D; at this vulnerability, it would be hard to double 3@S and if E/W bid on, they are going to be in trouble. 
I tend to be VERY aggressive after partner overcalls, especially non-vul. 
Sometimes it buys me -500, but more often than not, it is +140 or -50, as compared with -140,  
Which is why I like pard to have her bid when she overcalls in second seat!  Which East most surely did!

up|40|pf|y|at|mitche: Play:  West might try the effect of winning the second spade to make a club play; 
East can hardly want to be on lead at trick 3, looking at that dummy, if she has the @CK...
Finally, N played the trumps well. 
She might just try letting the @H7 run .. If the trumps are 4-2, this might save a trick if East has a high trump without the 10 or 9.

pg| ***** 52 ***** |


sk||at|mitche: Bidding:  Modern bidding has it that you bid the same after a double as you would without it, 
as far as "1 over 1" bids are concerned.
That said, I think E should have a slightly better hand, something like  @sJxx  @hK10xx  @dxxxx  @cKx for her bid.
The reason is that with a poor suit, you may wind up getting partner to make a disastrous opening lead....|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt||at||lb|*mmitche:  What do you all think west should bid after 1@H?^1NT~2@C~1@S^3|at|mitche:  So -- over 1@H what should West do??  
The options are pass, 1@S, 1NT, or 2@C.  
2@C is clearly out - you should have a 6 card suit (or a very good 5 bagger), which she does not have.  
Passing is also out – 1@H is a 1 round force.  
That leaves 1@S or 1NT.
Well, I think 1@S is right.  I hate it, but I bid it.  
Also, I think N's X is good -- even vulnerable and with a passed partner.|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt||at|East: A redouble should show about 10+ points; 
As a passed hand, you may want a hand that evaluates to 11+ points after the X, 
because third-hand openers may be very thin,  especially at this vulnerability.
|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  So after 1@S, East bid 1NT (and very reluctantly, I think).  
What should west do?|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


at| 
West should just pass quietly.  East has not got as many as 10 or 11 points. 
West has 14, so game is very unlikely.  
And if you know you have not got a game-going hand, then it's usually right to stop bidding as soon as 
you find a playable contract.|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


nt||at|kat827:  Did E have to bid after W's 1@S bid?
mitche:  Should 1@S have been forcing? I think it shows a full opening bid (not a weak third seat opener) 
or a distributional hand, so I would not pass in East's position.  Could I pass? Probably not...|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


nt||at|
Note MM: Using NMF (one or 2-way) or CBS, with the agreement of ALWAYS showing the other major first,
west has a nice 1NT bid after 1@h (showing a balanced, minimum hand)
West would then only bid 1@s if stronger or unbalanced.
IF east has the hand to make an enquiry, the @s fit (if there is one) will not be lost.
Ex:  1@c - 1@h / 1NT - 2@d (NMF) / 2@s - and responder can take it from there|

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: South guessed to lead a diamond, the unbid suit. 
South lead the 2@d.  That card is either from 3 to an honor or from 4 small. Yes?  
If it is from 4 small, declarer has 3 to the queen, and if it was from Qxx, then Liza has it.  
So it can hardly hurt for N to play the @D10 at trick 1. 
On this deal, it is not likely at all that declarer has 8 running tricks, 
so knocking out that hypothetical second stopper (the @DQ in declarer's hand) will mean 
the @DA has to go as soon as the defense gets in... |
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  One other point on the defense: 
When S led her diamond Queen, N played the @DJ from JT.  
I would have treated that as a request for a SPADE, not a club.  Declarer has a couple of entries to dummy and her only source of tricks is the club suit. 
So I will try to knock out the Spade entry first (declarer bid hearts, so I would like to  make declarer open up that suit)|

at|mitche: Bidding: After 1@S, N has a limit raise but just 3 card support.  
As you may recall, this problem is dealt with in 2 over 1 by doing what??
kat827:  bidding 1NT.
mitche:  Right! 1NT followed by a raise of spades; So N can bid 1NT, and S will try 2@C on her nice opener.|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


at|
Then 3@S by N tells the whole story: 10-12 HCP and 3 card support. 
After that, S bids 4 and makes the game easily.|
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  But wait, there's more! 
(sound like a Ronco commercial yet?)
realrowdy:  lol
mitche:  After the 7-9 dummy point raise, S can re-evaluate her hand. 
What does South's hand reevaluate to after the raise?  
13 HCP + how much or distribution?|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


nt||at|She has a singleton, worth 2 points + a 6th spade, worth at least 1 more point; that brings the total up to 16, 
Plus, the outside 4 card club suit is a "Quality" suit, worth yet another point. 
So her hand is worth at least 17 points.|
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


nt||at|(Actual Bergen points: 
Starting points = 17. Declarer points = 4; Total = 21).  
With 17 points, (and just 5 losers) S can take another bid. 
In this case, I would bid 4 (since the hands are worth a minimum of 24 points total.|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Some of you in the Washington, DC area may know Steve Robinson, a bridge Hall of Fame member. 
Steve is fond of saying, "the best game invitation is to bid game".  
Of course it helps to play the dummy as well as he does, but the idea is to bid close games. 
And south's hand guarantees that any extra strength brings the game home.|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


nt||at|ecolodge:  Would South always rebid 2@C or show 6 by bidding 2@S after the 1NT? 
mitche:  As for 1@S - 1NT/ 2@C, that is a stronger sequence than 1@S - 1NT/ 2@s . 
Bidding 2@C shows a maximum of about 17 points.  
Responder will pass 2@C only with 4 clubs, at most a doubleton spade, and a rock-bottom 1NT response. 
Most pairs at duplicate won't pass 2@C with a doubleton spades, but rather they will give a false preference to 2@S.|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


nt||at| 
I teach my students to bid 2@S in almost all circumstances 
(a 4-3 fit is less preferable than a 5-2 fit, because the 5 card suit is somewhat better able to withstand a bad split).

up|42|pf|y|at|mitche: Play:  W guessed to lead a small diamond which is probably correct against 2@S... 
South, how many diamond tricks can you take?
realrowdy:  Before I saw dummy none -- after dummy 3.
mitche:  OK, 3@d's, so why not take them at tricks 1, 2, and 3 to ditch your one and only losing heart???  
If someone ruffs the third diamond, you don't care. 
Because you were always going to lose that heart!  
If someone ruffs the second diamond, it means the suit split 7-1, and you might have heard about that in the bidding.|
pg| ***** 100 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Back to play
- when East discarded on the second round of trumps, her card was the @H2
I think she could have spared the @H7 to say that she likes hearts. 
When W wins her @SK, she can then safely lead hearts.. 
OK - thanks to the first group of players. It's now time to allow the next group to sit in.

pg| ***** 104 ***** |


sk||at|mitche: Bidding:  The 2@S bid is the Michaels Cue bid, saying "Hearts and a Minor" here.  
Usually 5-5 in shape, and holding enough strength to play at the 3 level vulnerable 
-- about 10 points minimum preferably in the 2 suits.  
S then bids 3@H, which given his hand looks right. |
pg| ***** 105 ***** |


at| 
West has a big hand again, and shows it with 3@S... That void is worth a lot, and so is the 7th spade.  
Over 4@D, though, I would pass and let partner make the final decision on what to do. 
She could be completely broke.|
pg| ***** 106 ***** |


nt||at|And what should 4@D bid mean in this auction??  
It means that S is willing to push to 4@H AND it says, "Pard, please lead a diamond if they get to 4@S's".  
This bid, once you have found a fit in a competitive auction, should be lead - directing. 
Reason - once you find your major suit fit, it's more useful in competition to help with lead than to look for a second fit.  
If btour's hand warranted a slam try, for example he would not have bid just 3 hearts, 
so there's no confusion about the bid.  |
pg| ***** 107 ***** |


nt||at|btour:  Is there an asking bid that I can find the minor?  Before I bid the hearts?
mitche:  You don't care about the minor -  You have committed the hand to hearts.  
If S wanted to know the minor, he bids 2NT at his first turn. 
N will then bid 3 or 4  clubs. So the auction 1@S (2@S) pass (2NT) says, "please bid your minor".  
But here, you know about the 9 card fit, and you're still not concerned about a slam.. 
so just be content to jam their auction.|
pg| ***** 108 ***** |


nt||at|  
I wouldn't even have minded 4@H with the S hand. 
If we have a secondary @D fit, great, else pard will be able to ruff clubs in dummy.|

up|40|pf|y|at|mitche: N dutifully led the @DA and then shifted to a heart when S discouraged with the 3.  
Declarer made the nice play of leading to the @CK and finessing in trumps. 
This is really good, because N has announced 10 cards in two suits, and there is a fair chance that spades will split 3-0. |
pg| ***** 121 ***** |


at|
So the finesse guarantees that she will lose at most 1 spade if that were the case.  
One other point for declarer...|
pg| ***** 122 ***** |


nt||at|After the @DA lead, she should use her third trump, the @S8 
as an entry to take a finesse against the @DQ in south hand. 
Why?  The defense has already taken a spade and the @DA; the small clubs are a third sure loser, 
and the only hope to make the contract legitimately is with 2 diamond tricks.|
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


nt||at|
(MM: north has shown 1 spade and 2 diamonds already and if N started 5-5 all is fine with the way it was played
as south has no lead back once in with @dQ (ruff-sluff)
If South had a club left (N started with 5-4) declarer would go down.)
And defensive play - if S is void in clubs when she put S in with the @SQ, it cannot hurt to make him lead out of his hand.|

sk||at|mitche: Bidding:  When S bid 2@H, he said "weak hand, long hearts".  And that is what S has.  
North bid 2NT, which should say "game invite", for which she is about a king light. 
I would pass 2@H with the N hand. 
North's strength will take tricks in any contract, but this South hand may be useless in any contract other than hearts.  
S should have 6 hearts for the bid, but the KQJ10x will play about as well most of the time.
Once again, the rule of the road - ON A MISFIT, Get Out Early!!!

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche:  Play:  E led the unbid suit, clubs. Seems right.  
Was declarer right in trying to ruff clubs?  What is dummy's most useful asset - the heart suit.  
Declarer should play a heart at trick 2 - then she can force an entry to dummy to ditch losers on hearts. |
pg| ***** 144 ***** |


at|
When N won the Ace and returned the suit, she is screaming to everyone at the table, "I want to ruff clubs!".  
That being so, East should not help her. 
And the way not to help her is to lead a trump at trick 3.|
pg| ***** 145 ***** |


nt||at|One other point on the club play. 
East knows that the @CK and 10 are equals after the J, Q, and Ace were played at trick 1.  
So in terms of trick-taking potential, there is no difference between playing one or the other.  
But West doesn't know about the club 10.  
So East should win the second club with the 10, not the king.|

sk||at|mitche: Bidding: With S hand I might have risked 2NT, showing about what he has - diamond stoppers and about 11 points. Some would say "exactly 11"
But 2@S isn't a bad bid either. N should have a 5 card suit and the Q9 play as well as xxx.|

btour:  Could we have arrived at and made 3NT?
mitche:  Let's see if 3NT makes - double dummy, not likely. 
Defense can win first trick and play a second round of diamonds, pinning the jack.|
pg| ***** 151 ***** |


at|
(MM: Lead would be coming from West though!)|
pg| ***** 152 ***** |


nt||at|
If declarer plays on spades, she cannot finesse in clubs, and to play on clubs leaves W with @H or @S entry. So no.
btour:  So if I decided to bid 2NT it would not have been good.  I deliberated hard on it.
Mitche:  Well, it would take the double-dummy play of the @DQ to pin the jack. 
Imperfect defense might allow you to scoot home with 8 tricks, but 9 is really hard.
(MM: At the end of this hand, you can try the play in NT by south, first in 2@s now)

up|32|pf|y|at|mitche: Play:  In 2@S, E led the @D9 (good!) and West signaled with the 8. Good!  
It says that it is safe to lead a second diamond.  
When declarer finessed a second time in clubs, East ruffed in and returned a heart to the singleton Ace, 
which was good defense -- West then made a third good play, the @CK. |
pg| ***** 164 ***** |


at|
If it was a singleton, then it was a forced play, but if not, 
it was a suit-preference signal asking East to return another heart.|
pg| ***** 165 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  The only heart East can't see is the K and declarer MUST have it. Why? |
pg| ***** 166 ***** |


at|
If West has the @HAKx, she would have won the first heart with the King.
(MM: Or play the Ace followed by the K to show a doubleton AK) 
So either West has it or she is now void.  
A heart would allow west to ruff with the @SK and to return a club for East to ruff.|
