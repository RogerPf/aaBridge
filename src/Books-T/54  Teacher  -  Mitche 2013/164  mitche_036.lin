^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||at|


^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

mitche: Hi, everyone and welcome to tonight's 2 over 1 bid, play and discuss session.
2 over 1 means: 
If your partner opens in first or second seat and you bid a non-jump 2 level bid, it is game-forcing.
Also if pard opens 1@H or 1@s in first/second seat, your response of 1NT (with no intervening bid) 
is forcing for 1 round .  Otherwise, the bidding looks a lot like SA|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||at|Kib:  Mitch, do you use reverse Bergen with 2/1? And do you use Drury?
mitche: I prefer regular Bergen, not reverse because you need the game invite more over the weaker response
Yes, 2-way reverse, but any Drury agreement is useful. 
There are very few 2/1 GF auctions: 
1@S- 2@C, or 1@S-2@D, or  1@S – 2@H or  1@H - 2@C, or  1@H - 2@D or  1@D – 2@C (and Jac2NT of course)

sk||pc|ca|at|mitche: Bidding: over 1@S, S has a very big hand. 
In 2 over 1, he correctly begins with 2@C, which establishes a game-forcing auction
N/S are now committed to game.. This also leaves the most room for them to look for a slam
Note, the club suit is pretty cheesy, but that's not a problem yet
Now N bids 2@S, which should be a 6 card suit. (mm: "Hardy style")|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: South should be thinking of the possibility of slam  and so he should bid just 3@S
North is not interested in the least, so he will sign off in 4
Using fast arrival, S would bid 4@S instead of 3 to show a minimum GF hand
And if S DID bid 3@S, then N should bid 4.. any other bid shows about 15-16 points minimum and is a CONTROL bid

up|24|pf|y|at|mitche: Now, on to play:
East led the @CA and W played the 9, the start of a high-low. 
Some pairs play that the lead of the Ace demands third hand to show attitude in the suit
If so, then W should play the 8. 
But whether you play third hand to show attitude or count, you must discuss it
If not then E has to guess what to do at trick 2.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: My recommendation: 
If you want partner to continue the suit, play a high card. If you want him to shift, play a low one
If you do play A from AK, then you have to decide whether the A asks for attitude or count 
or if it demands third hand to unblock a high honor|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So here, if W's 9 is attitude, E should play the K at trick 2 - In fact, he should anyway.
If N really did have a singleton Q, then W started with J98, and it's safe to lead the suit again
....but not smaii!!!
small (dagnab it, my case of thunderthumbs is acting up, daggone it!)|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt||at|Now: how should declarer take advantage of his gift at trick 2?|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


at|
I suggest that he pull trumps, and then play 3 rounds of hearts to get some information. 
Nothing good happens to tell him anything about the @D suit.
So he can make the 10 - or 12 trick play of a @D finesse. 
Or play safe for 11 tricks.      At matchpoints, the finesse is a top-or-bottom play..

pg| ***** 35 ***** |


at|
sebstar: 6 at least and a maximum of 9
BILAsst10: less than 10
mitche: Sounds about right. 
1NT has a maximum of about 10 or in some cases a horrible 11. (QJ, QJ, QJ, Q)|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So East can add his 15 and 1 more for the club suit = 16 and say, 
"If pard is at the top of her range, we might be able to make game"
How can East ask "are you at the top of your range?"|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


at| 
With a 2NT bid
West will go to game with 9+, pass with less
Remember Lew Stansby's advice to me: "I just bid my hand and let partner make the decisions"|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: East's hand has enough strength for an opening 1NT, 
but since he has 4-5 and one of the suits is spades, he isn't as interested in opening 1NT 
as he is in bidding his hand pattern
I would bid 1@C. 
Cliff228: But stoppers in the hearts and diamonds, I'd go 1NT|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: If you want to open the E hand 1NT, no one will be seriously upset, 
but you're losing the ability to tell pard where his points will help the most... 
Remember that 1NT is preemptive, taking away the entire 1-level. 
So you need to apply some discipline. 
I've seen 4441 hands opened 1NT, and sometimes you survive, others you die a ... horrible death :)

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Now, on to play: You know as declarer the old rule, 
^*B"high card from short hand"^*N to prevent blocking a suit
The very same rule applies for defenders!
btour:  yeah well I could not figure the 8....why not 4th best P?
mitche: S needed to play the @DQ at trick 1.|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


nt||at|If E/W have the @DA and K, then it doesn't matter whether he plays the 10 or Q, 
But if partner underled the Ace, South has to play both of his honors on the first 2 rounds of the suit to unblock it
This is a commonly-occurring situation. 
We all love to hang onto high cards, but sometimes it's a liability. 
And when pard leads low against NT, holding 3 cards to 2 honors is one of those times|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: You just have to get those honors out of pard's way! 
And N SHOULD lead the 6 (4th best)
Cliff228: Not top of sequence?
mitche: Not here.. you lead low (4th best) when you are trying to set up the suit.|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


nt||at|Then pard can use the rule of 11.  
6 from 11 leaves 5 cards higher than the 6 in declarer's, dummy's and third hand. 
Pard can see 4 of them, so he knows declarer cannot hold both  the A and J of diamonds
And if he does, he would recognize the 8 as top of nothing... 
So lead 4th best!|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


nt||at|mm: Top of ^*BInterior honor sequences^*N are considered good leads for good reasons...|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


at|
However, does A8764, the 8 as the top of an interior sequence fall in that category?
Interior sequences: ^*BAn honor sequence where the 2 lower cards are in sequence^*N for ex: KJT(xx)   QT9(xx)  AJT(xx)
A8764 is NOT an honor sequence (A5432)....does NOT help partner picture the suit...does NOT carry the advantages of interior honor sequence leads....does NOT allow partner to use the "rule of 11" on your mystery card.
Leaves the question: Why ARE interior honor sequence leads good leads? :)

sk||
pc|cj|at|mitche: Bidding: I think N should raise 1@S to 2
Reason: Even though the hand has just 6 HCP, it has 4 decent spades and a ruffing value
Pard could have as many as 18 points, and a raise might lead to 4@S when that is right.
And if pard has fewer than 16 points, he should pass 2@S|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: With 18 points, pard will not jump-shift, which is GF
Even Goren has to be right sometimes!
sebstar: does it take 19?
mitche: Although some people will jump-shift with hands that evaluate to as few as 16 dummy points
It takes 18-19 total points. 
Example, I would jumpshift with @sAKxx  @hKx  @dxx  @cKQJxx, where my @HK is working, I have a 19 "bergen count"|
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: But notice that hand I just gave has a lot of plusses and no minuses at all
I use modern losing count, where a jumpshift should show 5 losers 
My sample hand has 5 losers... 
dee_dee_20: that 's a good rule to keep in mind:)
It also depends on the suit texture.. I would like AK 109 much more than AK 64|
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Note that the sample hand would make game opposite as little as  @sQxxx  @hAxxx  @dxxx  @cxx
So count your losers!!!
I really do recommend that you all go read Ron Klinger's "Modern losing trick count"..

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: .. At 1@S, declarer can count as follows:
Losers: 2 hearts, 4 clubs, 1 or 2 diamonds, and unless very unlucky, no spades
So that brings the loser count to 4(+2)+1 or 4(+2)+2 = 7 or 8.    So the contract is safe (?)|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


at| 
(mm: somehow losers got lost as mitche totals 4+1 or 4+2 = 5 or 6
So it seems 2 @c ruffs are needed (with 2 @d losers) or 1 @c ruff and 1@d loser for 7 tricks)|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


at|
He should plan to play as safe as he can.. after 2 clubs and a diamond shift, he correctly ducks to set up the @DQ|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: As long as no one has a singleton @D, this is safe - and since no one overcalled in diamonds, 
it's not likely that they spit 6-1
When he regains the lead, he should pull trumps, cash his diamond winner and ruff a club. 
That gives him 7 tricks and assures the contract (only needs 1 @c ruff needed now as only 1 @d loser)
The line declarer took was lucky - had West held the @SJ or had he discarded diamond on the (second) club ruff 
(and not the @h6), the defense could have won at least 1 more trick...

pc|sa|at|mitche: Bidding: Well, nothing like a quiet little deal to get these folks started ... 
6@H makes from the East side I see, but only when S can be persuaded to lead a club..
Declarer cannot ditch all of his club losers on the hearts... 6@S or 6@H both go down 1 on best defense
With less than best defense, 6 will make|
pg| ***** 98 ***** |


nt||at|For example, in case S leads a diamond against 6@H, 
E/W get a ruff-sluff and make
But any other lead  defeats 6@S 
So let's see - wild hands are difficult to bid. 
I think that when W opens 1@S, E should think "we have a 10 card spade fit" 
and not worry about a different trump suit|
pg| ***** 99 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: She might bid 4@D, a SPLINTER BID to say "game raise in spades, diamond shortness"(MM:If you have the agreement that a splinter bid is 12-16 support points, you might find this hand too strong to bid the splinter and choose Jac2NT)
mitche: Anyway - when E bids 4@D, S should bid 5@D|
pg| ***** 100 ***** |


nt||at|Over 2@H, I would not mess around with the S hand, I just bid 5@D and let E/W guess what to do..

nt||at|mitche: So 5@C was plainly not justified. 
3NT might make, but it could be defeated on a spade lead and diamond shift 
Please remember this - a jump raise after a double is weak bid!
sebstar: If 5 club bid is not justified do they stop at 3?
mitche: yes, 3NT is a poor bet when pard shows a hand not good enough to bid anything except 3@C

up|45|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: W had to lead something, and she guessed to lead a @D; 
When East did not produce the @DA at trick 1, 
W knows S has that card, so there is no future in diamonds. 
So when she is in with the @HA she has to play the spade ace and a second spade.|
pg| ***** 137 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: There was a question on opening lead
West should not lead either major - we don't underlead aces in side suits against trump contracts, 
and to lead either ace is a guess
So she must decide whether to lead a diamond or a trump. 
The @D lead needs pard to make it work.|
pg| ***** 138 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: A trump lead might work best, 
but that is only because E is unlikely to have a high club card, given the bidding
I think a club would work well, because W has 2 pretty sure winners and would not like to blow a trick on opening lead by attacking

sk||pc|d7|at|mitche: Bidding: With a 5 card major, it's frequently correct to transfer into it when pard opens 1NT, 
and here W has a perfect hand for the transfer to 2@S -- 
W knows the contract belongs in game in either spades or NT
So how should she communicate that to pard?|
pg| ***** 147 ***** |


nt||at|sebstar: bid 3NT and pard corrects to spades if she has 3
mitche: Absolutely correct. With game values and just 5 of your major, a bid of 3NT says, 
"pick between 3NT and 4@S"
3@S says "invitational values, 6 spades" and asks pard to choose between 3 or 4 of the major|
pg| ***** 148 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: I want to suggest one more thing: 
N may want to double 2@H
First, it's doubtful that E/W will want to play in hearts, and second, it helps pard with her opening lead
If I were on lead with the S hand, I think I might lead the @CQ instead of the @D7

up|34|pf|y|at|mitche: Now on to play of the hand
I don't know what the @D7 is intended to convey. 
If I have a diamond honor, I lead small - or if  have 4 small, I lead 4th best. 
The 7 isn't top of nothing, so I think it best to  lead the @D4 if you lead diamonds, 
but to lead the @CQ in preference to any diamond|
pg| ***** 159 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: It establishes the @CJ unless S leads the suit a second time
Here is what I think should happen on this deal:
W bids 3NT over 2@S and they play it there. 
S should lead the heart (remember, N would have doubled), and E/W will make 10 tricks 
5 spades, 2 clubs, 2 hearts, 2 diamonds - (All but the 3 top winners in N hand)|
