^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |

^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

mitche: Hi, everyone and welcome to tonight's 2 over 1 play and discuss session.
2 over 1 means: 
If your partner opens in first or second seat and you bid a non-jump 2 level bid, it is game-forcing.
Also if pard opens 1@H or 1@s in first/second seat, your response of 1NT (with no intervening bid) 
is forcing for 1 round .  Otherwise, the bidding looks a lot like SA|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||at|92612:  Mitch, do you use reverse Bergen with 2/1? 
And do you use Drury?
mitche: I prefer regular Bergen, not reverse. 
Because you need the game invite more over the weaker response
Yes, 2-way reverse, but any Drury agreement is useful

sk||pc|sk|at|mitche: well, a wild start to tonite's hands!! Bidding:
3@S seems about 100% correct, and East has a problem .. 
I think double is the right answer, even with the somewhat unusual takeout shape... 
If West bids 4@D, well, hope she has a good 5 card suit , but otherwise, the X will work out well.
And this is consistent with the idea, "if you have to make a note-book bid, pick the one which, if it works, gives you the best outcome"|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So the double is somewhat off-shape, but it paid off 
calligal: what else could I have bid?
mitche: West had a reasonable hand with a singleton spade, but she has nothing better to say than 4@H
mitche: Gaylene asked if she could've done something else besides X.. Nope, the double was the best bid you could make.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Only one other idea. South might have decided to bid 4@S over the double.
Why? If North has a conventional 3@S bid, then the defense has perhaps 2 spade tricks and that's it.
So a 4@S bid might make it harder for E/W to find their game, and it rates to be a cheap sacrifice... 
perhaps only down 1, if partner can work a couple of club ruffs in...
realrowdy:  but does not fit LOTT
mitche: LOTT is a guide, not a law.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||at| mitche: Also, if E/W have a 9 card fit in hearts, 
then they can make 10 tricks when you go down 2.. 
WE can digress on LOTT, but I recommend reading Larry Cohen's books on it.|

up|32|pf|y|at|mitche: OK - on to Play: At trick 1, N led the @SK. 
South might have overtaken with the Ace and shifting to a @D in hope of giving her partner a ruff
S knows that there are no more spade tricks for the defense, 
so she may as well look for a trick in trumps|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: here is the idea 
- pard can't lead a void, and with the preempt, it's possible she has length in clubs to go with spades 
(S sees just 6 clubs between her hand and dummy, but 9  diamonds)... 
so pard is most likely to have a diamond void, if she has any void at all|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: The idea is to try to imagine a holding to defeat the contract, 
and a diamond void is the only hope of scoring more than 2 tricks 
- still not enough to beat the contract, but  ...

pc|hq|at|mitche: Bidding: West's 1NT response to 1@S was completely correct, playing 2 over 1
As was East's 2@S bid
West says "pretty  much any shape (without a spade raise), and between 6-12 points"
East's bid says "6 spades, minimum hand"
After that -- west's 3@C says, "weak hand, long clubs, at most 1 spade"
West's bid says "6-9 points, most of them in clubs"|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So a better idea is either 2NT or just pass on the misfit.
If you have a misfit, get out as soon as you can!
7047:  ty...wasn't sure with the 6 clubs
mitche: So passing 2@S rates to be the best course of action most of the time. 
It may be an ugly contract, but anything else is unlikely to improve it a lot... 
East heard 3@C and with a minimum hand and good club support, passes. 
She would pass even with a singleton club!|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: This is an important part of 2 over 1.. 
Since 2@C response would have been GF, and 3@C is probably Bergen, 
the only way for responder to show a bad hand with a long minor is to start with 1NT and then bid her minor as cheaply as possible

up|45|pf|y|at|mitche: On to the play: N led the @HQ, denying possession of the @HK, 
so when S has to play at trick 1, she should win the Ace
Why?|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


at|
Well, the simple answer is that if she doesn't, the defense may not win any hearts at all!|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: At notrump, it may be correct to withhold the Ace 
in order to get declarer to play the king (and allow you to run the suit) 
but at a suit contract, win that ace!|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: At trick 2, declarer played a club toward dummy. 
I think it is correct to finesse the @CQ with the hope of losing no club tricks at all
West's play of club to the Ace works only if S has a singleton @CK, (which is about a 12% shot)
So when N unexpectedly won his king, he correctly played a third club to lock declarer in dummy|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: when N came in with his @DK, he should then play another heart, since anything else is a losing idea
Summary: 
a) The auction we had shows a weak hand with no tolerance for opener's major and a long, long minor.
b) If you suspect a misfit, get out low!

pc|d8|at|mitche: Bidding: This was kind of an interesting hand
I think 1@D and 1@H are both 100% correct; 
East's 1@S is a matter of style and temperment. Many people would be completely happy to bid 1@S here, 
Some (I am one and I am in the minority here!!!) would bid 2@S, even with unfavorable vulnerability|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: The hand looks like a classic weak 2 
and I tend to like to bid the hand this way to get my full story out in a hurry,
Wayne_LV:  good 6 card suit, no outside values, WJO (weak jump overcall) is best description of the hand
mitche: The downside is that being vulnerable and stepping into the opponents' "live" auction could easily turn into -500 or -800, if pard is really broke.
So discuss with partner what a jump overcall shows here - whether it's a "weak 2" or an "intermediate 2"|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


nt||at|Wayne_LV:  unfavorable vulnerability I would be reluctant to open S hand with 2@S 
but no hesitation to overcall 2@S with 7 HCP
mitche: I tend to be very aggressive preempting. Most of the time, I survive. 
And at matchpoints (my favorite form of self-abuse) I don't have to explain -800 to teammates :)|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


nt||at|N's 4@H bid says, I want to play 4@H and not look for slam. 
But N has a 5 loser hand
So he knows that if S has the right minimum hand, a slam might be possible
(if you haven't ever heard of "Losing trick count", please, please google it and read up. It is a very valuable tool )
And S has more than a minimum opener (5 losers and the favorably-placed @SK)
So a better bid than 4@H might be  2@S, meaning "tell me more!"|
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


nt||at|Cliff228: Is 4@H  a close out?
mitche: 4@H says, "game, not slam", and it shows something like N hand, but without the @CQ
btour:  and if south makes the weak jump overcall?
mitche: After a limited 2@C bid, I think 4@H should not be forcing, 
unless S has an unusually good hand for hearts, something like x, Jx, AKxxxx, AQxx

pg| ***** 78 ***** |


at|
If W believes the @D lead was singleton, she can use her play as a suit-preference signal
The @DQ says Lead the higher ranking side-suit
If W had an entry, the size of the @D card should say where to look for it.|
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Since W does NOT have an entry, she should play the diamond least likely to get the defense in trouble, 
and that is a high diamond. 
West does not want partner guessing to lead a club and possibly finessing herself|
pg| ***** 80 ***** |

Play point #2: 
It is odds-on that East, who bid spades, has the @S Ace, 
but declarer can make sure of 12 tricks by cashing 4 clubs to discard a small spade from hand

pc|h3|at|mitche: Bidding: I think that the N hand should have a better spade suit for her 2@S bid, especially vulnerable
A better 2@S bid would be KQ10xxx, Kx, xxxx, x (make the @DQ the @SQ)
Remember that a weak 2 should advertise a suit headed by 3 of top 5 honors (QJ10 or better)
Some people (Marty Bergen, in particular), are a lot more flexible, but not in first seat, vulnerable|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


nt||at|In second seat, it is even more important to have a decent weak 2.. 
You know that 3rd and 4th hand have the balance of power (first seat passed)
So you should have a good suit... 
OK - now, the 3@D bid...|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


nt||at| Most pairs treat any new suit by unpassed hand as forcing
So 3@D should show a pretty specific type of hand - 
I think that most people play it as a decent suit with tolerance for the opener's weak 2 and also, an opening hand!
So N should, if she is playing standard, would like to bid 4@D. 
Perhaps pard will like his double fit and bid 4@S|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


nt||at|sblitz:  What would S do if he had a void or singleton in @S (i.e., no "tolerance" for @S)?  Pass?  
Even with opening points and a 7 card @D suit with three honors?
mitche: Can responder tolerate playing at the 4 level? 
If so, he might bid 3@D and rebid 4@D over 3@S
I think that unless you have a hand like void, xx, AKQxxxx, KJ10x, 
you should not try to improve a weak 2 with your own suit|
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


nt||at|Reasons: 
a) misfits still get out as soon as possible

sk||pc|c3|at|mitche: Bidding: I think that east's best rebid over 2@D would've been 2@H since in standard bidding, 
south could have 4 hearts... 
Most 2 over 1 players treat the auction 1@S – 2@H as showing 5 hearts 
Reason for that: If responder has 4@H and a balanced hand, 
they will make natural NT bid (if available) or bid 2 of a minor...|
pg| ***** 134 ***** |


nt||at| mitche: I also think that 2@S rebid should deny 4 hearts and be the kind of hand that cannot bid a natural 2NT.
(this over 2 of a minor, game-forcing by responder)
Now - the 2@D bid. 
My preference is to bid 2@C (4 card suits up the line by responder, when making 2 over 1 rebid)
Reason: If opener has some hand with 5/4 in the black suits, it's harder to find a club fit
Just remember - responder's 2 over 1 bid shows 4 card suits "up the line" 
(of course you bid a 5 card suit in preference to a 4 bagger)|
pg| ***** 135 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Someone asked if 2@S promises 6. Not necessarily. 
If opener were 5-2-1-5 on a minimum, 2@S would be my choice of bids
But in any case, 2@S denies being able to bid a 4 card suit at the 2 level
Cliff228: Even on a 2/1 bid, you wouldn't bid 3@c?
mitche: yes.|
pg| ***** 136 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: I would need to be above minimum to bid 3@C .. either very shapely or having extras.
For instance: AQJxx, Kx, x, AJxxx would be about the weakest 3@C bid I'd make
Remeber, 2@D suggests not having 4 card club suit! 
And the advantage of 2 over 1 is that you do not have to worry about being passed out in 2@S.
Back to the bidding.. after 2@S, west knew where she wanted to play the contract, so she just bid 3NT.
I like that bid to show this kind of hand.. minimum 2 over 1... all suits stopped, balanced .. perfect!

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: Around trick 8, declarer knocked out the @H Ace and a club came back. 
At this point in play, should declarer finesse the club?
I think she should. If the defense plays another club, then declarer just cashes winners 
(3 hearts and club ace, losing the last trick to the @D Ace)|
pg| ***** 151 ***** |


nt||at| mitche: If the finesse wins, then she makes 11 tricks
In other words, she has nothing to lose at that point by taking the finesse
maspd: I knew from the first trick where the K was
OK, let me thank Eileen for her generous assistance and all of you for your courteous attention and questions.|
