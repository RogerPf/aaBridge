^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

sk|e|lb|*cPlease choose your opening lead^^SQ^H8SQJT85D7642C742|pc|C7|sk||at|mitche: Bidding:  After 1NT opener showing 15-17, South knows that her hand is good enough for game 
and probably not good enough for slam.  
S has 6 losers and 1NT shows about 6 or 7.  So slam would require a magic hand AND a maximum, too. 
So S used a TEXAS transfer (bidding at the 4 level).  
Compare that with an auction like 1NT – 2@d / 2@H – 4@H.  Both of them get you to 4@H, right?|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||at|So you can use one of these auctions, the Texas transfer, to show a "game but not slam" hand (but wait, there's more)... 
and a Jacoby transfer sequence and jump to game to show a hand that would like to look for slam. 
Change S's @dK to the @DA (or if you prefer, the @SK to the @SA) and the hand is now, definitely, in the slam zone.
OK .. then, if you use Jacoby to get to 4@H, opener should cooperate in a slam try by cue-bidding with a good fit 
(3 or 4 cards) and good controls (Aces and Kings, not quacks).|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|  
One last tweak -- If you use Texas Transfers and then bid 4NT, it is blackwood (RKCB) 
-- that was the "but wait, there's more" remark. |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||at|Mitche: I recommend using that treatment with your regular partners. 
It is very common among tournament players.  So: Generally Texas Transfers do not have slam interest 
- except if responder rebids 4NT

(mm: 4NT = no doubt slam interest, just checking if not an Ace off, 
a stronger hand than the one using Jacoby and jumping to game, a milder try)|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Jacoby helps you discover your fit.  
1NT – 2@d / 2@h - 3NT for example offers opener a choice of games
There is an even better variation called "South African Texas Transfers", 
but you should first become familiar with the standard form before you look at SAT.

sk||at|mitche:  Bidding:  I don't mind 1@H opening bid, as it meets the rule of 22 
(quick tricks + HCP + length of 2 longest suits = 22)
msphola: Is the rule of 22 used in all seats?
mitche:  In first/second seats only.|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


at| 
1@S is the book bid with West hand.  After that, we are on shaky ground.  
Bidding 1NT with a singleton in pard's suit is almost always a bad idea.  
Better, would be 2@C by East.|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt||at|It conveys the hand's distributional nature and will dissuade West from rebidding spades with a cruddy suit.  
If East bids 2@C, W should probably invite with 3@S, saying bid or pass as you think best.  
It shows 10-11 HCP and a good 6-card suit. |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Technically, West's spades are not good enough for 3@S, which should be at worst QJ109xx or better, KJ109xx.  
The problem with 2@D after 2@C is that it's 4th suit forcing, and W is not eager to force to game on her hand, 
without much of a fit.  
Also, 3@D is also GF, but most pairs use a JUMP in the 4th suit as something else.  
So without an agreement, I would probably bid 3@S with West's hand and pray for East to have either a singleton honor or two small.|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: What would 3@D mean?  
By agreement, it's either 6-5 shape or a mini-splinter, 
showing 4 card support for opener's SECOND Suit and a singleton.  
But you have to have discussed it first.  
I use it as mini-splinter in my expert partnerships.|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt||at|Anyway - back to our actual auction, 
I think that West should pass 3NT 
(East would have taken a preference with 3@S if she had a doubleton)
veeree:  I should have passed 3@d
mitche: You CANNOT pass 3@D.  That bid must be forcing!

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play:  North's opening lead of the @C9 is likely to confuse partner 
- leading second highest from 109xx is not standard.  
I would prefer the @C10 to the @C9.  
West - Eleanor, your play in a shaky contract was very good. 
You needed a 3-3 split in trumps and the @HQ onside (amongst others to cut your losses)
|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: There is just 1 other suggestion in playing the hand. 
When South won the @HQ and returned a spade - she would never underlead the Ace here. 
So you may as well insert the @SJ and  hope that S had the @SQ

pg| ***** 60 ***** |


sk||pc|C3|at|mitche: I think that most people treat 4@S in the auction 1@S – 4@S as a preemptive raise with 5 trumps, and perhaps 5-6 HCP.  The reason for that narrow range of points is that an opening 1@S could be 11 or 12 HCP or 19 or 20.  
If West was just short of a 2@C opener, then she has to be confident that there's no slam in the wind.
So what should East do with her 10 point, super-solid raise?|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


nt||at|I would bid 3@D to show a limit raise with 4 trumps.  
Actually, 3@D is a bit of an underbid, but with only quacks outside of spades, I think it fits.  
That would be a Bergen raise. The problem E/W have is that in standard (and 2 over 1, too), 
an opening 1@S bid could have 7 or 8 losers at the weak end, or 4 1/2 losers at the strong end.

sk||at|mitche:  Bidding:  West's 2@H bid is about what I think it should be - 7-9 HCP and 3 card support.  
Playing 2 over 1 with Bergen, that is standard.  
West is not good enough to use an invitational Drury sequence.  
Once West limits her hand, East should just content himself with 4@H.  
West needs a magic hand for slam to make, so East should  not tell the opponents that much about his hand.|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


nt||at|Also, splintering with a singleton Ace is controversial. 
The idea of a splinter is to tell pard "discount your high cards here, because they're in a bad place for my hand".|
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


at|
dee_dee_20: With a known 9 card fit and 2 outside aces E has 11 tricks.  How can he explore?
(mm: I am not sure how you get to 11 tricks, that seems presuming partner's 3 small trumps are 3 tricks?
Ruffing what? P only has 3 hearts, the rest is clubs, diamonds and spades
I see a 5-loser hand, where I hope partner (2@h) can take care of 2 to make game
How often will a 2@h response take care of 4 losers? )|
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: There are several ways E/W could look for slam.  
One of them is for E to bid 2NT, conventionally (not Standard) asking west to bid shortness if she has any.  
But shortness is usually defined as a doubleton or shorter. 
There are several other tools, but they get kind of intricate ... 
|
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: If E/W use game tries of any sort, then East might roll out his game try and then to bid game 
even if responder doesn't accept.  
You'd need some conventions to find a slam here. 
(or play precision or something - but this ain't a precision class. For that you visit Oliver)|
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


nt||at|In my standard 2 over 1 partnership: 
pass 1@H / 2@H 2NT/ 3@D – 3@S (tell me more)/4@D (singleton)/5@C - still looking for slam - 6@S 
(OK, OK. we get to slam)     mm: Though not "standard" but using 2NT 
mitch:  But you won't ever duplicate that auction unless you have a lot of time to discuss your system with your regular partner... 
kat827:  A 2NT by E can also be a game try, right? (asking for honours in hearts in W's hand?)
mitche: Kate, there are LOTS of agreements you can use, and that is one of them.

sk||at|mitche: Bidding: Even though East has 16 HCP and a (single) club stopper, the correct bid for that hand is double.  
Why?|
pg| ***** 98 ***** |


at|
East would love to find pard's major suit, and 1NT very strongly suggests that he isn't particularly interested in the majors
1NT overcalls should 
- have better than Kx in the opener's suit 
- and not 4-4 in the majors.|
pg| ***** 99 ***** |


nt||at|btour:  I asked for an undo
mitche: I know you did 
The reason I did not allow the undo is to take advantage of the opportunity to make a very important point.  
Your bid should be the one that communicates the most important fact about your hand to your pard.  
In this case, the message needs to be, "bid a major, pard!".  
Now - after the auction goes 1@c by pard and 1NT overcall, what should responder(south) do? |
pg| ***** 100 ***** |


nt||at|Remember that opener has 13 points (well, 12 or occasionally 11 ... 10????  Oh, how standards have fallen :)).  
So when responder has 10 points, it means that his side has the balance of power. 
With 23 points, N/S have about enough strength to take 8 tricks on average. Right???  
And S has 9 points including an ace and a guarded queen, looking like a couple of defensive tricks or entries, 
so she may be able to set @d's up |
pg| ***** 101 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: If N/S can take 8 tricks, E/W can take 5... 
If they are bidding to take 7 tricks, then they're down 2.  
Also, the knowledge that dummy is going to be broke (at most 4-5) 
means that declarer would be playing out of his hand with a dead dummy.   
So be aggressive in doubling a 1NT overcall with 2 tricks or a good suit. 
1NTX will go down 2 for sure, and if declarer tries to take more, he could be down 3.

After 2@S (which shows a minimum raise 6-9), West might just bid 4@S, and as we see, even 4@S might have been too high

The X (after 3@c) says that we are going to penalize the opps if they are at the 3 level, 
so I doubled on general strength.  
Perhaps E/W will escape, but I expect to go plus (maybe +300 on a part score) most of the time.|

nt||at|mitche: W has a 4 loser hand after the fit has been disclosed, and she is bidding for East to have a 7 loser hand.  
But with a 7-loser hand, East would have opened the bidding. 
So slam is at best going to be on good breaks and a finesse.  
You do not like bidding to slams that are at best 50%.|

When you double a voluntarily-bid slam, you are gambling that an unusual lead will beat the slam.
So all slam doubles  (ALL of them) should be Lightener doubles, named after Ted Lightener, 
one of the early greats of the game. 
The usual meaning of a lightener double is to ask for a lead of dummy's first bid suit 
Even with 4 losers, West has not got a slammish hand.|

btour:  What does the lightener double call for?
mitche: Usually, dummy's first-bid suit. Or, if opener has a long suit, he should lead that, expecting  a ruff.

up|41|pf|y|at|mitche: Play:  Declarer should ruff a couple of clubs and pull 3 rounds of trumps, 
followed by a diamond lead.  
This will allow her to get out for down 1.. 
but the best idea is to duck the opening lead and hope N led away from the @HK.
ecolodge:  How does W get back to the board after the 1st @c ruff?
mitche: Trump -- Or if she ducked the opening lead, the @HA
