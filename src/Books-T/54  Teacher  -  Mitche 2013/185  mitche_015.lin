^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
He's been mentoring in BIL for 2 years and lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

He learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Prefect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|

^b@2We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

mitche: Hi, everyone and welcome to tonight's 2 over 1 play and discuss session.
2 over 1 means: 
If your partner opens in first or second seat and you bid a non-jump 2 level bid, it is game-forcing.
Also if pard opens 1@H or 1@s in first/second seat, your response of 1NT (with no intervening bid) 
is forcing for 1 round .  Otherwise, the bidding looks a lot like SA|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||at|92612:  Mitch, do you use reverse Bergen with 2/1? 
And do you use drury?
mitche: I prefer regular Bergen, not reverse. 
Because you need the game invite more over the weaker response
Yes, 2-way reverse, but any Drury agreement is useful

at|mitche: Bidding: South intended 2@D to be "inverted", i.e. a strong @D raise.
I think her hand is a shade too weak for an inverted raise, 
You may want to discuss those bids. 
I don't mind asking during the auction as this is a teaching environment
But anyway, 2@D was intended to be a strong @D raise.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: West's 2@H was not unreasonable. 
I prefer 2@H to any other bid she could make

I am not sure I would have raised 2@H to 3, though, because East has really ratty distribution (4333) and also she has a 10 loser hand!
Best to pass with that hand. Bidding will get you into trouble more often than not
And 4@H is in trouble.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt||at|gypsy1308: Is it better to bid than double when you hold a 5 card suit?
mitche: You're thinking about West's 2@H bid?
I prefer 2@H because I don't know what to do if pard bids 2@S or some number of NT. 
2@H shows "where West lives", so to speak. 
And W would like a heart led against a diamond contract, most likely

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: N can hardly avoid leading diamonds, and S played the 10 under the Ace
I am guessing that the 10 was to show encouragement, "I like diamonds"
OK - so which card should S play to show encouragement for @D? 
I think that it's very hard  to show both suit preference and attitude  in this situation. 
So I will suggest that attitude should come first in the suits you bid and lead
So I would play the @DJ, the most encouraging card I have. 
S can't know that West is void (she may have a very strong suspicion, but she cannot know for sure)|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: This means that when N wins the @HK at trick 2, she should lead another @D 
This forces West to ruff the lead.
And then NS will win the @HK, a spade, and 2 or possibly 3 clubs to beat 4@H by 2 tricks
Which is why 3@H was a risky bid|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt||at|realrowdy:  Is that good practice? I was trying to avoid ruff and sluff
mitche: In many cases, forcing declarer to ruff is good defense. 
Should you have trump length (or suspect partner has), then it's a very good idea.
You may have heard the term "forcing defense" - 
The reason that making declarer ruff here is a good idea, is that she will have to lead away from any strength she has in her hand
And that suits the defense just fine|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So in summary:  
a) the @D10 was not "suit preference for spades" - it said, "I like diamonds" and 
b) looking at dummy, N could tell that any spade tricks coming to the defense could not disappear.
If W had the @CA, you still score the @CK and 2 spades.

sk||at|mitche: Bidding: West's hand is pretty nice, but not quite good enough to insist on getting to game, so rather than bidding 2@C (as would be the SA bid), west properly bid 1NT, forcing.|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


nt||at|North took her life in her hands with the 2@S bid. She should have a better spade suit for that call because 
a) she is vulnerable 
b) her pard couldn't move over 1@H, 
c) the  opponents are in a "live" auction, where both partners' strength is unlimited
If you overcall in this auction with that kind of hand, sooner or later, you will find yourself giving 500 or 800 to the opponents. And probably sooner.
|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt||at|realrowdy:  I thought 1NT limits to 12
mitche: Maybe not: because 2NT can't show the 13-15 point natural bid, most people play 1@H - 3NT to show that range.
So that means that people can (and some do) use the auction 1@H - 1NT / 2 of any - 3NT 
to show the very big (16+) balanced hand
That is the common method to show a very big NT hand when playing 2 over 1 GF
Let me make sure I am clear - when pard opens and  responder has the monster NT hand, it's common to start with 1NT response and jump to 3NT|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: In any event, N wants better spades.
irinica:  Is 1NT forcing unlimited?
mitche: Well, you usually think of it as limited to 12, except for the instance we just discussed. 
So for all practical intents, yes it's limited to 12
Which means that EW could have 20 + 12 = 32 HCP on the auction 1@H - 1NT
More likely, they have 21-23....(14 opposite 8 or so)|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: When N does bid 2@S, S looks at the singleton spade and long hearts and thinks "I bet this hand is a misfit!"
And the golden rule of misfits - STOP BIDDING!
If your pard bids 2@S, you might get lucky with 3@C, but in the long run, you will come out ahead by dropping the bidding on extreme misfits as soon as you can|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: When 3@C comes around to East, she should not pass
But neither should she bid 3@D, which I think should show better diamonds here - either stronger or (preferably) longer
So what should East do? If I held East's hand, I would reopen with a double
The balancing double says, "I can tolerate any suit you bid" and also, it invites West to convert the double to penalty|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt||at|3@C probably is defeated 2 tricks with normal defense. 
S cannot both set up the spades and get to dummy to enjoy them, so she's likely to lose a spade, 2 diamonds, 2 trumps, and she still will have 3 hearts to dispose of
East can stand to play in diamonds or hearts...  the balancing X is primarily take-out|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: OK - so East bid 3@D, which West passed. 
As E had passed 2@S, her 3@D bid cannot be based on a very big hand.
If East has long clubs in front of the club bidder, it is riskier for her to double for penalties. 
A balancing X in this situation (over 3@C pass, pass) should be primarily takeout, but West is free to convert to penalties
And if you recall the discussion a couple of weeks ago about the rule of 10 and 12 for converting takeout X, 
you will see that W has a very, very sound conversion.|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Here is the point I want you all to consider. What clues do I get from the bidding?
Here, S knew early about the misfit, so she should realize that pulling to 3@C can get her in more trouble than passing 2@S
East may decide, based on her distribution, that NS are on a misfit and therefore, the balancing X may be the winning decision

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: When S ruffed the spade ace at trick 3, she had to figure out what to lead
What should South know about the hearts?|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


at|
East opened 1@H so she has at least 5 of them.
So S knows that North will have at most 1 heart
This is known from the bidding
If N has 1 heart, then IF south leads a heart (she should not), she should lead the @HA and then a second heart for her partner to ruff
Why should S not lead a heart?|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: The chances are awfully, awfully good that East has the @HK and likely the @HJ, too
So by leaving hearts alone, S will win 2 heart tricks
South should place at least 3 spades (maybe 4, Since N did not jump to 3@S, she probably has just 6 of them. So S can count "1 in my hand, 2 in dummy, 6 with pard, therefore 4 with declarer") in declarer's hand to go along with the 5 hearts that she knows about
And the 3@D bid says "at least 4 diamonds"|
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So how many clubs can declarer have? At most 1.
So the @CAce should hit the table.
But even better, once S realizes that East is short in clubs, best for her to play a trump to kill the cross-ruff
Since East is known to have shortness in clubs and length in spades, it looks like EW will want to crossruff
So the cure for crossruffs is to pull declarer's trumps :)|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: All right - let's summarize key points - 
a) try not to improve contracts when you know there is a misfit. Get out low and take your chances. In the long run, you'll do better
b) try to use the bidding to build a picture of the unseen hands 
In this case, the bidding almost certainly places East with 4540 shape, or maybe 3541 or 3550 shape
This "inferential" count can lead you to the best defense, of leading trumps every chance you get

at|mitche: Bidding: after 2@D, I wonder what you would have bid with the N hand.
First, how many dummy points do you think N's hand is worth?|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


at|
Well, it has 10 HCP, and a void, worth around 5, and an outside 5 card suit, worth another point = 16
Now what does 2@S say? 
It says "7-9 or maybe a bad 10" and 3 spades
So North's 2@S bid is a slight underbid, by about 2 aces' worth 
An immediate cue bid of 3@D says "limit raise or better with 4 trumps" |
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: But even better is for N to bid 4@D, game raise in spades and shortness in diamonds
When you splinter, you guarantee 4 or more card support. 
The reason for a splinter here is because 
a) the shortness and 
b) the absence of an ace|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: South has wasted strength in diamonds and knows not to look for a slam
But imagine that S had the KQx of hearts -- now, she might make a mild slam try of 4@H over 4@D
The pont here: if you splinter, your partner immediately knows whether she has working cards or wasted strength
Here, S would know not to get frisky because the @DKQx look useless, based on the bidding|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: BTW, with the S hand, I would not have blasted into 4@S after the simple 2@S bid. 
In fact, if north's bid showed 7-10, with 3 card support, I would likely pass

At matchpoints, you might make a case for 2@D, but not here. 
And even at matchpoints, I might just sell out, S has a very poor hand
So yes, 2@D would best be taken as a transfer, but no, S should not do it

sk||at|mitche: bidding: 
First: S has an ugly problem after the 1@S overcall
There is no good bid she can make.
But the bid I would have chosen is 3@S, which says "please bid 3NT with a spade stop"
I don't love N's options after 3@S. 
As it happens 3NT is going to make 5, but only because W can't ever get in.
So this is a pretty darned hard problem.|
pg| ***** 135 ***** |


nt||at|gypsy1308: I thought a 2/1 bid was forcing to game
mitche: well, 2@D is forcing, but because of the overcall, it is not the same as a 2 over 1 GF auction, which is one without interference bidding
With interference, you are back to SA treatment
BILAsst10: is 2@D forcing?
mitche: 2@D is 100% forcing
Why?|
pg| ***** 136 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: With a bad hand, S just passes 1@S
So S has to have some values.
With a weak hand and long @D's, S bids 3@D over 1@S. So those 2 hand types are out.
S did not make a neg X, so she really has diamonds (or should)
So she has points (at least 10 of them for the free bid)
North really should not pass. Even with a diamond fit, she should not pass. 2@D is forcing. 
Forcing, I say!!!|
pg| ***** 137 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: (and then the instructor ran off, frothing at the mouth :) :) )
Joking aside, a free bid shows at least 10 points here and should be treated as 100% forcing for 1 round
BILAsst10: always have trouble with forcing bids in competition, except a cue bid
mitche: General rule: a new suit at a new level by unpassed responder should be treated as forcing for 1 round
Anyway, 2@D is a horrible contract|
pg| ***** 138 ***** |


nt||at|Wayne_LV:  Can N bid 3NT with Qxx? pretty iffy stop
mitche: Right, Wayne, 3NT is a very dicey bid by N, had S bid 3@S

up|36|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: Defensive question: After the first 2 tricks, the @S10 was high. 
I wonder why East would have led the 5 at trick 3, rather than just cashing the @S10?
Wayne_LV:  I took J as top of doubleton
mitche: It was, so the @S10 would have cashed...
Wayne_LV:  senilty? There are 3 kinds of bridge players 1. those that can count 2. those that cant 
mitche: being a mathematician, I say  -- duuhhhh??? :)
Wayne_LV:  tells you which kind I am

sk||at|mitche: Bidding: When 2@D comes back to North, she has a hand that is too good to pass.
She should bid either 2@S or reopen with a double
Reason: you don't want to sell out to the opponents 
N has excellent support for anything S can say, and S may very well just bid 2@S with the right hand
When EW stop at 2@D, they have found a fit
And N has just 1 diamond, so NS have a fit, too|
pg| ***** 161 ***** |


nt||at|analisals: Couldn't west cue bid spades show 4 diamonds here?
mitche: When E bids 2@D, the message is "6 diamonds and minimum opening bid"
If that is what East has, why would West want to push toward game?
maspd: I think I am a little short on points to cue bid but if they had gone to 2@S I would have said 3@D
mitche: West's comment about 3@D is spot-on.
She has spade shortness and 4 card support, so 3@D can't be bad, even at this vulnerability, not when east promised 6 of them|
pg| ***** 162 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Second, the cue bid here is NOT limit raise or better. 

1@d  p  1@h  1@s
2@d  p  2@s = "I have a spade stopper, do you want to bid NT??"

(MM: I think in earlier sessions you used Western cuebids, and here it would be ASKING, not telling the stop right?
Ops bid 1 = ask; Ops bid 2 = Tell)|
pg| ***** 163 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: The key bidding point here: 
North's balancing bid should be either 2@S or double 
(I think the spade weakness and excellent 3 card support kind of push me to reopen with X)
Also, partner could not convert 2@S reopening bid into a penalty X of 2@D|
pg| ***** 164 ***** |


nt||at|North has 6313 shape; with concentrated strength in hearts and clubs. 
Her spades (Q8xxxx) aren't all that great (note the lack of texture in the hand).
a) North might have tried doubling 1@H and then bidding spades, but the spade suit is too thin 
and the outsides suits too good for that sequence.
b) North should think, "the opponents have settled in 2@D, so they have some sort of fit. 
If they have a fit, so do we, and I need to help us find it"|
pg| ***** 165 ***** |


nt||at|North already announced spade length; so rebidding spades doesn't convey the hand's strength. 
As N knows that S has a weak hand, the X must show strength.The X has 2 advantages:
- first, pard might have a diamond stack and  would be able to pass. 
- second, the X allows S to find a club fit OR return to spades OR to bid 2NT with something like Jx, xxx, KJx, Jxxxx|

up|44|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: Declarer should probably cross to the @HA at trick 2 to lead a small trump
Playing the @SA at trick 2 runs a small risk that S would ruff with a small singleton trump and E would still have to lose a second diamond
Playing the @HA is almost certain to allow East to hold his trump losers to 1 any time it is possible to do so
He would win the @HA and then play the @D10 from dummy. If N plays small, he does, too|
pg| ***** 179 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: That is about it for this evening! 
The hands gave us 2 really valuable lesson deals - the counting example (where E had 4-5-4-0)  and the balancing X (last deal). The key was, "pard cannot convert 2@S into a penalty X of 2@D.
