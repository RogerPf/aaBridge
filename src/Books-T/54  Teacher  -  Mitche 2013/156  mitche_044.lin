^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

ecolodge:  Can you give a brief review of points needed and/or suits needed to bid over the X?|

mitche:  quickly ...
- If you raise, it's competing.
- A double or triple raise is preemptive.
- With 3-card constructive raise, bid 2@C (BROMAD) 
- With 4-card support and 7-9 dummy points, bid 2@D 
- If you have a 4-card support and 10+ points, use Jordan 2NT

That's the short, short version. |

So tonight we will cover the case of an overcall over opener's suit. 
When they bid a suit (natural)|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|
 
"If you have a misfit, get out as soon as possible". 

Apart from flawed opening leads and not planning at trick 1, I think the most significant source of lost matchpoints is  bidding too high on misfit hands. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
And as Marty Bergen and many others have observed, "the best bid in bridge is raising partner's suit" 
- especially if it's a major! 

Some preliminaries:
First, we want to discuss what to do if you don't have a big fit with partner... |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


at|

Let's start with the case where the opponents bid over your partner's opening bid and you have room at the 1 level,for Example:
   1@C   (1@D)   ?? 
At the 1-level, your bid shows about 7 points or more and is forcing for 1 round.  
In other words, if you can bid at the 1 level, you pretty much ignore the overcall. 

Example: 
1@C  (1@D)  ??   Your hand is @sKxx  @hQJ10x  @dQxxx  @cxx |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|    Bid 1@H 

|cp|4|at|Note that this does NOT promise a 5 card suit, but that it DENIES the other major in this particular auction |cp|2|at|
 |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


at|
ecolodge:  Is 7 pts the minimum you can bid with at the 1 level?|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|
mitche:  well, no, you can bid with fewer points (6 or so), but you should have a better suit if you do.
Example: 1@C  (1@H)   ??      @sKQxxx  @hxxx  @dxx  @cJxx   is a clear 1@S bid.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


at|
A "free bid" at the 2-level, however, should be somewhat better.  
Most people use this bid to show 10 or more points. 

What is a "free" bid? And what do they charge if it ain't free???
(The term "free bid" dates back to the ancient days of bridge, where responder would strain to bid on the chance that opener had a very strong hand and responder wanted to make sure that opener had a chance to make a second bid. When second seat overcalls, responder is relieved of the obligation to keep the bidding open for opener to get a second shot, ...hence her bid was "free", not forced, and this was supposed to show 10+ points.) |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


at|
Nowadays, the tendency is for players to use "negative", i.e. light free bids, which I find works at matchpoints, 
but can be self-destructive if you aren't really careful.  
More on that later.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
^*bThe Negative Double:^*n

This is probably the single most important convention in the book!

If the auction begins with a suit bid by partner and an overcall below an agreed-upon level 
(usually 2NT, but I have played negative X through 4@S), the bid is takeout for the other two suits. |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


at|
Example: Your hand pattern is 4-2-4-3 and partner opens 1@C, overcalled by 1@H
Negtive X at the 1 level here, guarantees 4 of any unbid major. 
-- not 3, not 5 -- exactly  4!!|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


at| 

At higher levels, the negative X may show a bad 5 card major, but enough strength to play at the level 
the negative X forces you to.  
- If opener can rebid at the 1-level, then a  negative X promises a minimum of 6 or so points; 
- If opener is forced to bid at the 2-level (e.g. in the auction 1@S  (2@D), you should have pretty nearly 8 losers
- and at the 3 level, you guarantee about 12  dummy points (assuming your partner will open random 11 point hands) |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


at|
If your style favors sound openings, your negative X may be a bit lighter.
Example: 
1@S  (2@C)    and you have @sQx  @hJxxxx  @dKJx  @cKxx 

I would not like to bid 2NT with this collection, and I do not want to suggest that partner lead hearts, 
should she get the lead. So I double 2@C as the best alternative.  
NOTE: the only suits the negative doubler promises length in are unbid majors. Opener doesn't promise shortness in the overcalled suit. Neither does the doubler promise support for unbid minors. 
Negative doubles are designed to help you get to major suit contracts and know what you're doing!

ecolodge:  To use negative X, responder must have 10 pts and 2 or less of opener's major?  Is that correct? |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


at|
mitche: The point here is that at the 1 level, you may bid almost as if the overcaller had passed. 
Almost, but not quite - you have the added tools of the negative X and preemptive raises. 
kat827:  In your above example, you are doubling at the 2 level with 5, right?  However, you said that at the 1 level, it would show 4.  Am I interpreting this correctly? |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
mitche:  For example, if my hand were @sxx  @hKxxx  @dAxx  @cQJxx 
and the auction started 1@C by pard, 1@S overcall, I would double. |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


at|
The question about the 1 level is correct - I pretty much guarantee exactly 4 cards in any unbid major at the 1 level.
With a weak 4-5 in the majors I might double if the auction were 1@C  (1@D) -- |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


at| 
especially if my 5 hearts were trash.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


at|

ecolodge:  Responder can't bid 2@H in the previous example because of pts or because of lousy @H suit?|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


at|
mitche:  I usually reserve a free 2@H bid (as in the example auction) for a very good 4 card suit (KQJx) or a 5 bagger.  
And the 5-card suit should have some quality -- not @hJxxxx
I may lighten my requirements for a negative X at the 2 level slightly, depending on vulnerability, etc., 
but I will always try to  have a decent suit. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


at|

Back, now, to the prepared text.. :) 

^*BFit-showing bids after an overcall^*n|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


at|

There are a lot of conventions that have been invented over the decades to show the nature of responder's fit 
after an overcall. I prefer a simple agreement:
First, the best bids are raises. With 3-card support for opener's MAJOR
- a minimum raise of opener's major is competitive showing 3 card support and 5-9 points. 
Example: 
1@S  (2@C)        - @sJxx  @hxxxxx  @dKQx  @cxx   |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


at| 
With this 9 loser hand, 2@S is plenty. 
I will not negatively double or bid 2@H here, since we have a known 8-card spade fit.
- Second, with a better hand (10+ points) and support, cue bid. 
Example:
1@H  (1@S)       - @sxxx  @hKJxx  @dKx  @cK10xx       -- bid 2@S 
The cue bid shows a hand with 3 or more card support and at most 8  losers. 
Again, remember that when you force pard to the 3 level, you need a decent hand!
The sample hand is pretty nearly minimum for this sequence.|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2 
Preemptive Bids:  
If you are a strict adherent to the Law of Total Tricks (LOTT), you will jump-raise partner with 4-card support 
and 0-6 points, especially if your hand has a singleton somewhere. 
It is not necessary to bid after an overcall, so when you bid, you should have something to say, 
either strength or a fit! 
Remember that partner has another bid coming!  Reread the section on 2-level free bids. |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


at|

Sometimes we want to make tactical underbids, and here is one of the most common situations for doing so:  
^*B"death holdings"^*n |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


at|
Holding 3 small cards in the suit bid by your opponents isn't a great thing. 
Neither is Qxx or Jxx or even QJx -- these holdings seldom help partner win tricks.  
Until you have some idea that partner has shortness in an overcalled suit, 
don't get too frisky with the death holding -- xxx in the overcalled suit. |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


at|

So sometimes you pass the overcall - and now, it's up to opener to do something.... 
Suppose that you are opener and the auction goes 1@S by you, 2@C overcall, pass, pass... 
There you are, wondering what to do. 
If you rebid your suit, you should have a very good 5-card suit (4 of top 5 honors) or even better, 6 of them. 
Remember, responder will strain to support your major if she has any excuse to!   
Bidding a new suit (especially an unbid major) also suggests an unbalanced hand, 
so my first  preference is the ^*Breopening double^*N.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


at|  
Opener reopening with X suggests a shape of 5332 and a sound opener.  
It also gives responder the chance to convert the balancing takeout double to penalties on the right hand. |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


at| 
Opener could, of course, be 5440 or so, but the reopening X gives responder a chance to go for the jugular .. 
And as you know, I am happy to accept a 500 penalty on part-score hands or misfits. |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2 

So to summarize:  
When the opponents overcall, a negative X shows 4 card support for unbid majors; 
At the 2 level, you should still expect just 4 card support for unbid majors.  
We raise opener's major suit whenever we can do so, because it helps opener decide whether to bid, pass, or double. 


Ok let's play bridge!

Second bidding point: most people play "systems on" with NT overcalls,

b) the 3@H bid is invitational to 3NT or 4@H or (horrors!!) Pass.
East knows that there is an 8 card Heart fit, and she has a hand worth 10 or maybe 11 points in hearts. 
So East should just bid 4@H|

nt||at|mitche:  NOTE: if you happen to be playing Texas transfers, you would bid 4@D as a transfer to hearts, 
showing a hand worth game but with no slam interest. |

If you use Texas, then the sequence 
1NT – 2@D/ 2@H – 4@H is a mild slam try, showing about 14 or so dummy points in hearts.  |

nt||at|altak38:  What if my heart holding is xx?

up|29|pf|y|at|mitche:  Play:  Opening lead: 
I am partial to leading the @S10, not the @S6, to avoid blocking the spade suit. 
West will probably allow the declarer to win the @SJ, and then when she gets in with the diamond, 
the spades will run, as the cards lay.

sk||at|mitche: Bidding:  S was wondering what to do with his hand. How many losers does he have?
btour:  mitche made me ask
mitche:  Bob, the Devil did NOT make you do it!!
btour:  I was trying to figure it out.|
pg| ***** 108 ***** |

mitche:  OK How many losers does N have for a simple raise???
jkk9175: 9
ecolodge:  I counted at least 8.|
pg| ***** 109 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  If you remember the LOTT handout, a single raise shows 9 losers.
So 6+9 = 15 which is a 9 trick contract.. If S is very, very conservative (or snake bitten), he just passes.
btour: aw, yes but the hand has ruffing power.
mitche:  But there is a better way to find out. It is to use 1-2-3 as a specific kind of game try.  
If responder has 8 losers, he goes (but 8 losers is a limit raise most of the time, anyway).  
If responder is on a maximum AND THE MAXIMUM has an ace, then she should go on to game.  |
pg| ***** 110 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  What the 1-2-3 bidding sequence should say is 
"I have enough for game, BUT I need you to have aces for your bid, not queens and jacks. 
N has no aces, so she goes quietly.
Note that the Ace of clubs and @HK would be quite enough for game.. that is a little gadget I learned from a world class player..
|cp|4|at|MM: Compare with short suit game tries, long suit game tries, and the generalized 2NT game try.

sk||pc|C8|at|mitche: Bidding:  Seems pretty normal .. everyone had his or her bid.
jkk9175: Would you preemptive opening with the East hand vulnerable ? 
mitche:  No, it wouldn't occur to me to open 2@S vul in first seat on this hand.  
a) I have much too bad a suit and much too much outside, and
b) 3@S on this suit is too likely to make you bloody.
I admit to being old school on opening preempts. I like my suits to be at least halfway decent.|
pg| ***** 125 ***** |


nt||at|My friend, Marty Bergen, likes to open weak 2@s on pretty much any hand with 13 cards, 
but people have learned to deal with light preempts since he started the trend in the 1980's.
If you want to open this hand NV with a spade preempt, that is a matter of partnership understanding.  
At IMPS I would never do so with this hand. At MP, you may get lucky;

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play:  After the club lead and continuation, East is assured of winning a trump, so there wasn't much for declarer to do. She did well to ruff the 4th round of clubs with the @HA to avoid going down 2.

Thanks to Eileen for her generous assistance and to all of you for your courteous attention.
