fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2zaXXon:  Hi all and welcome.

The first hand today is to remind us what we were doing last session.
We were making some investigations, discovering information in the opponents hands.

Once we could see how one or two suits are divided between opponents' hands, 
we should try to check the 3rd suit, 
thus clarifying the 4th and most important one! 
Using the surest count in this game - 13!

Let's start with board 1


LadyStar17:  @D@D Join Zaxxon on Fridays at 4 PM EDT for a six board free tourney. 
Zaxxon will host this tourney and make rounds of the tables and comment and answer questions. 
It will be an exciting afternoon. Check tournament listings on Friday @H@H


MM: Many thanks to David (Major_blue) for saving the hands and editing the chat for this presentation!

partner makes a wild jump to game

pc|sk|at|zaXon: The game is not so good, but far from hopeless
Let's try to forecast tricks/losers... |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


at|
Holden47:  We have 2@S losers, 1@D, 1@C. If the king is with W then we make the contract
zaXXon: true and true... 
2 @S and a @D losers are sure, a @C is likely
We have some work in @C tricks|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||at|Winners are: 
5 trumps,   1 spade ruff in dummy,    2 aces,     one more  @C  if @CK is in West 
(very likely)...... still that's only 9 tricks.
Well, let's see @S's first

pc|SA|pc|S7|pc|SQ|pc|S8|at|zaXXon: We can perhaps get ALL THREE @C-tricks if one of two splits occur: 
either    Kx in West      or K10x(+) in West ..
ah, we just received a winner in @S's
not for long, East will ruff it...
           
|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||
pc|S5|pc|H9|at|So, we ruff high|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||pc|C3|pc|SJ|at|Well, as we said, there are 2 ways to avoid @C loser...
However, we have to decide how to play the suit
If west has Kx, we have to play small to @CJ
but if West has K10x(+), we need to finesse twice... How to decide?|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||at|This is possible to discover... we don't want to guess 
Holden47:  We are down if we guess wrong
zaXXon: So, we have to avoid the guess, if possible.  :)
Everybody guesses wrong from time to time. Everybody!|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: What have we seen so far?|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|
We saw already spades are divided 6:2, right?
In 2-3 moves we could see how the trumps are
To get the @C picture, we need information in the last suit - diamonds - ladies' favorites :)
 ...and we have to investigate @D's right now

|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||

Here the light bulb should be shining brightly.
When west shows the last @D, this means he had 6142|

pg| ***** 23 ***** |


up|46|pf|any-time|at|alumna:  What if @D's are 6:1? 
zaXXon: Yes - this could happen  
But 6061 is very unlikely, and we would need West to have a singleton @CK to make our contract 
We have to play for Kx.  Surely West would bid differently with 6061.|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: If East has the last @D, than West is 6133 and we have to finesse @C's twice!
We can be sure here now, that West can't have  @cK10x,  as he can only have two @C's|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


at|
Well - west could have xx or 10x (not Kx) in @C
....but in that scenario we could do nothing
Our target is to use the moments, when we are lucky :)|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt||at|In summary, if West has K8 or K10 then we must lead @C2 to the J. 
If West has K108 then we must lead @CQ.     So we needed to know how many @C's West had.

MM: You can play the hand Double dummy if you wish by clicking on the cards. The lead was the @dQ.

mb|p3H3S4Hdppp|at|zaXXon: Not always is such a careful investigation so important.
Sometimes the danger is visible and we should look to avoid it somehow
We start with a pre-emptive 3@H (be careful at that vulnerability)
partner raises (he usually does, lol)
|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt||

pc|da|at|zaXXon: ouch
A concerning double, but we have to be honest - the dummy is very good
It should be a pleasure to make a plan.    Is it?|

nt||at|Holden47:  Losing  2@S,  1@H,  0 @C
zaXXon: (dont forget to count winning tricks as well) 
Major_Blue: Win the lead and draw trumps, making 5@H's, 1@D, 4@C's. What can go wrong ?
isabable: Trumps might be 0:4
zaXXon: Well, we have 7, so we could take the trumps, even if 4:0
and we have enough tricks, even without tricks in @S (6 @H's +4 @C's). 
So what's the danger?|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt||at|The danger is to lose 4 tricks, before cashing 10|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


at|
wyoming33: Give up our @S-losers and trump the 3rd?
zaXXon: Well, that is really a nice point!
@S's are most likely 6:2     and if we play trumps .... East would take the  2nd @H, play @SK and lead another @s.
West wins and plays a 3rd @S to be ruffed, because there would be no trumps left in dummy!
That would be 2 spade losers, a spade ruff and the @hAce for 4 losers..
So, how to resolve? |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |

playing on the @S suit while we have trumps in dummy!|

@S's could be 7:1 and a @S could break the communications at once.

Usually, this should mean that that normal line wins :)
Let's see an example
|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt||

pc|h2|at|zaXXon: ...and we face a very poor dummy
dkgrab:  Not a lot of transportation here
zaXXon: true
Seems dummy has 1@S and 1@H trick, but we can't get there.
Most of the times with very strong vs very weak hand, transportation is the common problem
Any plans?|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt||at|Holden47:  Have to play out the spade and hearts first 
and hope that you can get into dummy with the jack of diamonds?

MrsD12345:  What does @C9  indicate, no honour?

That would be too kind to be true.
Holden47:  What's the worst they can do if it doesn't work?

If we happen to be lucky to find @DQx, we need to establish some tricks in dummy first
Well, we are in hand with the 3rd @H.

If we finesse successfully, we are home...
It's time to ask ourselves a question...
Why didn't east just continue spades? (he saw us play the Q)
and just sit and wait till he gets his @dQ?|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


nt||at|Most likely - he does not have @DQ !!
If they leave us in hand  => we need @DQx
and, if there is really Qx, we can't go wrong ..
YES WE COULD :)
They make a move in diamonds "offering us a chance"  to take a @d finesse.... which wont win !!
Don't accept the Trojan horse

pc|da|at|zaXXon: Dummy is OK (although only 3-3 in the Majors) and we should have no problems.
alumna: Double with only 3-3 in the Majors ? We have been taught to pass not X. Is that outdated method? 
zaXXon: I find pass too old-fashioned. But I would prefer to have at least 4-3 in Majors.
But north has 14 points and cannot bear to pass.
Bidding 2@C with such poor suit is not better.|

up|20|pf|any-time|at|zaXXon: That's why he did not play another @D, but we think as he does.
West did not want to let declarer know he might have the @sK singleton. 
And West plays the @HJ to put declarer kindly in dummy, to encourage him to take a Spade finesse?  
"No, thanks."
By the way, the singleton King is not so unlikely - West opened the bidding and already shows long diamonds.|
