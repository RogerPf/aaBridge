^b@2zaXXon:  Hi everybody, welcome.  It's nice to see you all here again.

It's time again to discuss how to think on the way to making the right decision more often.
If you paid attention, until now we tried to place ^*bhonor cards^*n, 
counting opponent hands in the light of bidding. 
Depending on whether they opened or not, did they overcall or make a t/o double, we were placing their 
high cards and we made our decisions. 
...but...
Many more correct guesses however, are based on ^*bdistribution^*n. 
The information of distribution is powerful and very useful. 
And, most importantly - it is more reliable. |
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


at|
Why is that?
Well, for example, suppose our right opponent opened 1@H. 
We use for our plans the information that he has at least 11-12 HCP and 5 hearts. 
Great! 
...But sometimes he has a wild distribution and he opens with less - 10 points or even 9 :(
Or he passed with 12, because he doesn't like them....   or some other reason.
As summary - players can upgrade or downgrade their hands for different reasons and we can miscount 
the hand strengths.
Not with distribution - again, for example, suppose we are playing 6NT. 
Suppose also we see spades are divided 1:6, hearts are 5:2, and diamonds lie 4:2. 
so, we can be SURE, that clubs will come 3:3. 
That is because every player has 13 cards... and cannot upgrade them!
He can pass with 13 points or overcall with 5 points and a 4-card suit, 
but he can't have 12 cards, neither 15! :) |

mb|1C3H3Nppp|at|zaXXon: Want to see?  Let's go...
With a most popular bridge contract, 3NT
|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||

pc|h8|at|zaXXon: We have points for game, but no choice after the 3@H pre-emptive weak jump overcall.
3NT becomes our contract.
The dummy is not immediately exciting.
We have only one @H stopper and about  6-7 tricks
It's hard to see how to collect 9 tricks now, so let's see the first few tricks|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: Should we take the first @H, or second?|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|
shoemad:  First. West had a singleton.
wyoming33: So we might as well take this one.
You both are correct - this should be a singleton
But there is no rush, so can take 2nd

pc|HK|pc|HA|pc|D8|pc|H7|at|No surprises, the first suit is clear. 
As expected, @H are 1:7

Now, we need a @D trick, also we believe the pre-empt hand does not have that Ace
We close an eye :)

Well, how many sure tricks do we have at the moment?|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |

2 in the pocket, 5 on the table
8th could be in @C's
9th we need from spade finesse which is likely, to be honest.
Let us check @C's

What to play?    K? or J?|

Well, I don't know which spade East has
but I know how many tricks I have 
and how many I need!|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: We have 5
Thus we need 4 more.
We have a club, so we need 3 spade tricks!
And there is only 1 way to make them all

nt||pc|SK|pc|SQ|sk||at|zaXXon: Playing K, we can't lose a trick, we can only win 1
If the Queen does not appear, we will establish a spade for -1

pc|cq|at|zaXXon: In this next deal, East is even unkinder to us, opening four Clubs!
We can do nothing, but dbl ...  Partner forces with his 5@C bid. 
Maybe both majors... and we jump to 6@s
Don't blame the bidding; After such high pre-empts bidding is always like this, 
but - we have to agree we hit a good spot!|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: A quick count: 
4@S + 3@H + 1@D + 2@C + @C ruff in dummy = 11
+ chances in @H (3-3) or @D finesse
Not bad :)
If @S are not 5-0, of course

We have to cash trumps, but maybe we have to ruff our @C10 immediately.
4-1 @S is very likely,
East has 8 @C's, to open 4@C
