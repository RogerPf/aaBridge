^b@2zaXXon:  Hello friends, welcome.  

Are you ready for some fun tonight?
Well, I have found and will use an old file with some old deals..
However, there is a problem with these hands - they're dealt from a dirty old pack of cards 
and one of them  (@S10) is really wet, sticky and dirty.
So, when we happen to hold the @S10 in our hand, we may drop it under the table 
- just to keep our hands clean...
I'm kidding, of course. But there is some truth as well.

Tonight we will try to deceive the declarer a little bit
...and hiding some cards (specially the @S10) may be helpful  :)



MM: @d@dMany thanks to David (Major_blue) for saving the hands and editing the chat for this presentation!
And thanks to Eileen (wyoming33), always there to help out! @d@d

pc|hq|At|zaXXon: After a 1NT response by East, the opponents are in 4@S 
Partner leads the @HQ.
Having most of defense's resources, we can easily calculate all tricks.
What should we expect with declarer for his 1@S and 3NT bids?|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |

Well, 18-20 balanced seems a fair range, and yes, probably 5332 or so.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: Even with 18 only, adding 7 in dummy and our 10....
...leaves partner with 5 at most.
So, besides the @HQJ, he may still have a Queen or Jack
Most Queens and Jacks are visible however, except in @C's
The @CJ is useless, so the @CQ is the max partner can have and which may be helpful.

Playing the @S10 first is useless - declarer will take our Q next for sure.

nt||sk|w|
pc|SQ|at|zaXXon: Now he has real problem... he started, most likely with  @sAKxxx   vs   @sJ9x
He may well finesse the @S10 if spades are   @s10xxx   vs   @sQ  (for North/South)
And if you don't believe in that chance, put yourself in declarer position... |

CarlieG:  Test clubs - where is the Queen?  Small club first
zaXXon: Dummy's diamonds will be established very soon
True - we need 2 @C-tricks and it's time to play for them, small @C is best.
There is no danger of a stiff K, so small is just fine.

up|20|pf|any-time|at|zaXXon: This is a classic position to defend: ^*bQ10 in trumps^*n, you may like to write it down.
Of course, in some deals declarer will have 6 spades and will not be cooked,
but this play has nothing to lose.
As I said, drop the @S10 on the floor :)

pc|s2|at|zaXXon: Partner leads the @S2    (3rd/5th)
So, we need some tricks in @S's 
...and let's hope the @S2 is 3rd, not 5th. 
Let us try to construct declarer's hand:|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: @S's we expect to be Axx, right?   So   @sAxx. 
Then 6 hearts with 2 honors may be?   @HAQxxxx (or KQ)     and   4 minor cards.
So, we may expect to take 2@S's + 1 trump + @DA ?|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |

There is a hurdle however - declarer may discard a @S on those clubs...

But if we put an honor, he would expect a @S-trick   (@s10 with partner)    and may discard a @D 
In any case, it costs us nothing.

We have 3 @S-tricks and the @HK, we need just one more..
Say we take the @hK  ^*uand^*n the @s10    ...and then exit with a @C...
How many tricks does declarer have?    Did somebody count?|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt||at|
1@S,   3@H,   2@C,  2 or 4 @D (4 if he finds the @dQ)
8 or 10, so he needs to find the @DQ
Fine, we cash the @S10, exit with a @C and leave him to guess...
Would he guess correctly? I don't know... but he has a 50% chance with a 2-way finesse
Can we push declarer in the wrong direction?|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: Yes there is a way to make it an at least 80% in our favor chance...|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


at|
We do NOT cash this @S... but we exit with a @C
Don't forget that declarer does not know where this @S is!
And if he believes North has it... than he would finesse @D's into the "safe" opponent, us, South.|

We need the @DQ as a trick to beat the contract. 
wyoming33: We may not get that @S though?
zaXXon: Then 9 tricks is a 50% chance if you reveal  the @S10.
In spades south showed an even number, it sure looks like we have the 10, and declarer would finesse us (correctly)
So we do all we can to DENY that @s10 (by not cashing it first) so that it appears that South is the safe hand.|

Most of these plays are in hands where you are already alone, no problem to deceive partner together with declarer
This is a very important point.
