mn|Introduction|
fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^bSession 15: 2nd Defense session       }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2zaXXon:  Hello friends, welcome everyone

A week ago we have started our adventure in the land of defending.
As you could see, defenders job is tough.
Declarer's job is not - he looks for a plan and goes for it.
Defenders must first find out what the declarer's plan is..... and once they find it.... 
they should search for a way to prevent its execution....meantime, helping (sharing information) with his partner.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


at|

Most often, while making your plan to defeat the contract, you would need to "guess".
And "guessing" could concern several parts of the game...
Perhaps, "which honour does partner have?"    Or, "how many diamond tricks does declarer have?"  
Or, "where is declarer's entry to hand to cash those clubs?"       and so on!

Today we may try to think together, while looking for the best defence.


MM: @d@dMany thanks to David (Major_blue) for saving the hands and editing the chat for this presentation!@d@d

pc|Dq|at|zaXXon: Against a standard 3NT contract, partner leads dummy's suit.  
I don't know why.
Here and now, before we touch the first card, we should create an overview
We plan while declarer makes hìs plan.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at| 
First, as always - can we separate the missing points between partner and declarer?|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||at|
wyoming33: Declarer West should have less than 10 HCP 
zaXXon: Yep: Declarer bids 1NT (up to 10)   and accepted invitation => minimum he holds is 7
Well, we and dummy have  25 HCP,  West 8/9
So, we may expect one more honour card (most likely a high @c) in partner's hand  (besides the @dQJ10x)


|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||

pc|D2|At|zaXXon: Fine, meantime, dummy plays low...
At the same time, we are trying to count some declarer tricks...|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|
2 or 3 @S-tricks (probably 3) 
2 @h's (finesse of the @hQ is not working)
1@d max (this @dK in dummy) so he needs some clubs!
What about tricks we need?|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: 5...ouch
1@c, may be 1@h, no spades...
Definitely, we need to cash the @d-suit - can we do this?
|

nt||lb|*cWhich diamond should you play?^^da^da5|
pc|DA|pc|D4|at|zaXXon: Yes, we can - but only if partner has @dQJ109(+)...
...and if we unblock the suit right now!
For the rest we need?|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |

a @c-entry to partner.

After partner's 1@S overcall, opponents landed in a @h-game.|

(dont think it's not fair - at a table you would have less!)|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


at|
wyoming33: P has @sQJ and maybe @S10
Holden47:  We have a @d-trick and a spade-trick - P has max 3 @s-points so must have points elsewhere. 
zaXXon: Good - you wrote nothing wrong.
Did somebody calculate how many points we may expect with partner (besides @SQJ)?|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt||at|
Major_Blue: I'd give partner about 9 points, maybe @SQJ10xxx
zaXXon: Yes - about 8-9 should be a good expectation. (overcalled vulnerable) 
So, I would expect 1 side-trick in partner's hand...   +1 @d (my King)
So, we need 2 spade tricks..
|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt||pc|SA|lb|*cWhich spade should you play?^^sk^sk2|
pc|SK|pc|S3|at|zaXXon: Unblocking looks automatic
And could work if partner has QJ10 or QJ9  or even QJxxx, but with @hA (we may ruff) 
You should trust your partner :)

up|27|pf|any-time|at|zaXXon: It may seem easy...but just note what would happen if we keep the @SK
Declarer plays on trumps and partner has no more entries!
Declarer's last @S goes on dummy diamonds, sooner or later.
BILAsst11:  With this hand unblocking  was obvious, but others not so clear.  How to judge?|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: How to judge - try to imagine how many entries your partner probably has.
If one only - unblock
...or be sure you would unblock the suit before his entry is killed.

pg| ***** 41 ***** |

zaXXon: Well, if partner has a ^*ublack entry^*n, we may play small
...but if he has a @d entry (@dK),    ^*bwe must protect it, until @h's are cleared^*n|

up|19|pf|any-time|at|zaXXon: To be honest - Playing the Ace còuld lose a trick.
Holden47:  But if you hadn't played the Ace of diamonds wouldn't the result have been the same?|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


at|
zaXXon: Not really!!  ^*bPlaying small kills partner's entry before the @h's are set up^*n. 
By playing the Ace you can play a @h to set them up. ^*uThen^*n partner wins his entry and collects the @h tricks.|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: Playing the @dA could be wrong if declarer has K10x and is going to finesse @dJ
Nothing is sure in bridge game :)
BILAsst11:  So since partner probably has only 1 entry you take the chance and play the Ace.
zaXXon: Yes|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: One more point: 
We may switch places of the @dAce and  @dK
If we switch them and dummy plays a @d,|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |

We should jump with @dK !   To protect partner's @dAce as entry.
Would we do it ? :)|

OK - let's look for the answer together.
We can see 3 tricks for the defense:  @cAce + 2 in the bag
We need just one more. Where it could be?|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


nt||at|We can't take more in @S's and @c's
If partner has a trump trick, he will take it anyway. 
Same if he has the @dAce|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


at|
Declarer should have some @c-length
And there are not enough trumps in dummy to ruff them all.|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: The problem is that @d's could be set up by playing A, K and a ruff.
And then the dummy would be good for discards.
Suppose we were to continue with a trump...
Declarer follows with the  @dA, @dK, @d ruff, trump and trump (staying in dummy) and it's over.|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: There is only one slim chance..
To remove dummy's entry (shortening trumps)
If we find partner with the @cK we may force dummy to ruff|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


nt||at|And there would be no way to return to dummy after ruffing @d's
(partner has the last outstanding @s => not entry in spades)
The only way to make - to try one more ruff and 3-2 trumps
zenoo:  You think declarer has 5 @h's for that bidding?
zaXXon: We have no chance if he has more
Don't forget, that 3@d bid promised @h-support, so he may easily have 5
