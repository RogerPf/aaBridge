fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2zaXXon:  Welcome people.  It's nice to see you here again.

Today we will continue our efforts to investigate the opponent's hands in the way to take the right decisions.  
Last week we started the discussion on a new variation of hands.   

There are many hands, where we have to mix real information (which we see) ...
with specific conditions, given from current hand or single suit (what we need).   

A summary of both factors create a picture and our plan should follow it accordingly.


This mix is not easy...
Let's go!



LadyStar17:  @D@D Join Zaxxon on Fridays at 4 PM EDT for a six board free tourney. 
Zaxxon will host this tourney and make rounds of the tables and comment and answer questions. 
It will be an exciting afternoon. Check tournament listings on Friday @H@H

MM: Many thanks to David (Major_blue) for saving the hands and editing the chat for this presentation!

pc|dt|at|zaXXon: It's hard to bid creatively over opposition's  1NT, so let us jump aggressively to 4@s   
Lucky, it went without a double. 
Even better, we have escaped @c lead.  
Do you think we have a chance?|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


at|
I hear you saying it depends on location of @S honors,  also the @CA. 
This quite correct.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||at|We should have no doubts where the @c Ace is. 
If we assume East has 15 then West can only have 3 points, maximum. 
So two @c losers are pretty sure. 
We have to take trumps with one loss only, and West can not have any aces. 
There is only one entry to the dummy hand :(
Let's play off @DAK and perhaps the Q will drop, promoting our @DJ ?

How should we play trumps when East plays low?
What card do we play from the South hand?
Yes, @SK. 
We know it will win, but playing @SJ would lose if West has @SQ. 
If we have to play this suit alone, without clues, we should start with small to Jack!
But the clues told us that West did not have @SAce.|

up|20|pf|any-time|at|zaXXon: :)
If the NT opener has @sAQx, - we can't prevent losing 2 tricks when East ducks the first Spade.  
- This is the mix of clues, which was mentioned earlier.
Firstly, a condition we ^*bneeded^*n - spades 2-2. 
We hope for this and play accordingly.
Secondly, information we ^*bhave^*n - the Ace is with East
As a result - winning play small to the King|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||at|...if there is winning play at all :)
Let me emphasise, that playing @sK we can't lose that trick. We can only win.
Playing @sK is wrong only when West has singleton A or Ax

MM: You can play the hand Double dummy if you wish by clicking on the cards. The lead was the @d10.

pc|dj|at|zaXXon: It's far from clear what to do over the 2@s raise, but we are lucky today
(and we believe we play better :) )
Dummy comes with mix of good and bad news... 4 trumps (great)
but 4333 :(
Try to forecast stocks, until opponents' cash diamonds.

Don't  worry if you have bad plan: It's much better to have any, than no plan!|

8 ever, 9 never for the spades?
Spade finesse?  We have a 2-way finesse, and we want to play it in the right direction as we have a choice...|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt||at|wyoming33: E has shown 7 HCP already - and did not open
btour:  If east has the @HK he probably does not have @sQ
zaXXon: Some of you are working this out well.  
Ok, as you said, we can lose 1 more only.... and we almost sure have to give @c!
Thus, heart finesse to work is mandatory!
There is a correct line.  First to check @c for miracle (doubleton QJ)   

|

East already showed 10 points.

The @cK has been moved to the South hand. Do you see the difference/implication?|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


at|
We cannot check @h finesse now before playing trumps, because we do not have the entry to dummy's hand.
Now we have to apply the condition: we ^*bNEED^*n @HK on the right.
Once we decide we need it, we trust it is there.

up|26|pf|any-time|at|zaXXon: That was a complicated one.
Not every time you can divide the points so clearly, but when you can, you have to use it.
So, first - we saw the spades are 5-3.
We placed @cA (from the biding)
We needed @hK on hook.
Which gave us @d position as well|

Don't think this will work every time. 
If we place a card somewhere because we need it, it will be there exactly 50% of the time   :)
But our task is to use all these good 50 %'s 
We can work to be more lucky, trust me :)|
