^b@2zaXXon:  Hello friends, welcome everyone

We will continue today our walk in defender's shoes. 
I know it's hard...
If you remember our declarer discussions, 
we have tried many times to place the missing high-cards between the opponents, 
thus planning the play in a better way.
So, the same applies to defense's business as well.      But!|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


at|

Most times, the declarer will have a much better hand than our partner has. 
Thus, constructing declarer's hand may not be easy.
For example - picturing a strong NT hand from 21 missing HCP's is not an easy job.
It looks much easier to arrange/picture partner's hand, having 5-6 points. 
Let us see how



MM: @d@dMany thanks to David (Major_blue) for saving the hands and editing the chat for this presentation!@d@d

at|zaXXon: We have a good suit to make a simple overcall at the 1-level
and the left opponent (LHO) closes the bidding abruptly.
|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||


pc|s4|At|zaXXon: Partner duly leads the @S4...
The dummy startles us with a long and good @C-suit
|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||pc|S8|at|zaXXon: Dummy plays small... and we should decide how to proceed.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||lb|*cWhich spade should you play?^^sa^sajt96|at|zaXXon: It seems very likely we can credit declarer with 2 spade stops for that jump to 3NT.
Partner has  5-6 points.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|
If we count declarer for 2 @S-tricks, 6 @C's from dummy (very likely, if declarer has honors in all suits)
AND the @hAce   ...      9 tricks seem ready to be taken!|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||at|If we duck the @sAce, he only has 1 spade to take readily
But if he has a heart honor in hand (which is 100%), again 9 + then you can't knock out that entry from dummy.
=> clubs could even be played from the top if declarer does not hold the @cQ |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


at|
Do you think we may beat the contract somehow (and this should happen without delay)?
We need 4 more tricks.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||at|Holden47: We have to hope p has some diamonds
zaXXon: Yes, these 5 tricks can be found...in diamonds only.
If partner has the @CQ protected, even better - but losing time now to hold up the @SA is not good!|

up|16|pf|any-time|at|zaXXon: Well, partner has great diamonds, as it happens. 
It might not have been so, but one thing we know 
- the spade horse is lame and the @H suit does not look promising either.
So our hopes went to @D's naturally|

|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt||

pc|h3|at|zaXXon: Partner leads your suit, but don't read too much into it. 
West's 1NT bid indicates a weak @H holding by your partner.

|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt||pc|H6|at|zaXXon: Dummy plays small and it's your turn to shine.|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt||lb|*cWhich heart should you play?^^ha^HAT9875|at|zaXXon: Well - we can't count declarer tricks, as we don't know his hand 
but we know partner could have 3-4 points at best.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


at|
West accepted the game invitation, more likely he has 17.
We may be sure declarer has 2 stops, the  @HKJ most likely
=> We need to find a suit to cash some tricks|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


pc|HA|pc|H4|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: Imagine some high cards in our partner's hand and check if it is likely to bring us 5 tricks
@CK - badly placed if partner has it
@DK - may hope, but we have 2 @D's only
@SK - now this could help us get quick tricks. 
So, we take and shift in @S's|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt||lb|*cWhich spade should you lead now?^^sj^SAJ94|
pc|SJ|pc|SQ|pc|SK|pc|S2|at|zaXXon: And we should lead the J!
With the J we try to either force the Q (or the J holds if declarer ducks)
This @S10 in dummy is an ugly card and we should care to finesse it|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


hc|sas9|
at|
with the  @sA9
thus, we shifted with @SJ - and close an eye, west covered the J with the Q
and all we need is  @SKxx from partner  (as that would give  @sQxx to declarer)
|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt||lc|sas9|

up|16|pf|any-time|at|zaXXon: Well, may be the @SJ is not a very natural move...
But, if we look for a card to beat the contract and we believe this card is the @SK, then leading the Jack is correct.
If we return a small @S, declarer plays small too and he then has a stopper.
We hope to take all 4 tricks in the spade suit.|
