at|JRG, West, led the @D7 (4th best). Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on. Don't expect very much in the way of help from the defenders - both JRG and ohjelvik are strong technical players. |

sk||hs|es|hs|ec|at|JRG discarded a spade on this trick and ohjelvik was caught in an interesting squeeze. |

ls|es|hs|nc|at|A club discard was obviously out as that would allow Greg to win 2 more club tricks. |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


ls|ec|ls|nc|hs|es|at|Ohjelvik therefore discarded his remaining small spade (discarding the @SQ is no better). |

hs|ws|hs|ss|at|JRG would then have to give Greg the last 2 tricks with the @SK and @SJ. |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


up|2|ls|ws|at|Also note that it was necessary for Greg to play the @S6 under ohjelvik's @SQ. If he had made the natural play of covering with the @SK, |

ls|ss|pc|sk|
hs|ws|at|JRG would defeat the contract by either ducking or winning the trick. |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


ls|ws|up|3|hs|nc|hs|ec|nt|Ohjelvik's @C9 signal at trick 2 turned out to be critical as this play led to the the tenace position that existed in clubs in the end game. Ohjelvik can certainly be excused for this "mistake" as the end position that occurred was impossible to foresee and we strongly believe in giving our partners the loudest signals that we think we can afford. |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|Even if ohjelvik had somehow known to hold on to his @C9 we suspect that Greg would have found another way to make his contract (but we doubt that his line would have resulted in an ending as pretty as the one that actually occurred). |
