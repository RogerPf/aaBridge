This week's deal was played by one computer program and defended by another computer program. How about that?!?

The declarer was ^*BGIB^*N which is widely considered to the be the strongest computer program ever developed when it comes to playing randomly dealt bridge hands. This particular hand that GIB played was not randomly dealt. It is one of the 180 declarer play problems that comes with ^*BBridge Master 2000^*N (an educational program that I developed that is designed to test and improve the user's declarer play skills).

GIB is an acronym for "Ginsberg's Intelligent Bridgeplayer". The "Ginsberg" in this title is my friend ^*BMatt Ginsberg^*N, the brilliant programmer who created GIB. Besides being a world renowned authority in artificial intelligence research, Matt also happens to be a fine bridge player. He has utilized his skills with both bridge and computers to create a truly remarkable program. GIB still makes silly mistakes on occasion, but on many deals its bridge ability (especially its card play) is at or above the level of human experts.

For the last few months my company has been in charge of the technical support and distribution of GIB. This arrangement will allow Matt (who is a very busy man) to focus whatever time he has for GIB on what he does best - improving its level of bridge ability.

Matt has been using Bridge Master for years as a means of evaluating GIB's declarer play. Bridge Master is ideal for this purpose because it only allows the user (or computer) that is playing against it to make his/her/its contract only if proper declarer play technique is employed. Any mistake that is made is punished in that the contract will be defeated.

Each deal in Bridge Master comes with an animated ^*BBridge Movie^*N that is similar in nature to ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N. Each Bridge Movie describes the correct line of play for its deal as well as the reasoning behind the correct line. GIB is not quite smart enough to read the Bridge Movies yet!

I created all of the instructional deals that are included in Bridge Master 2000. I gave this week's deal to GIB as a test and I was surprised to learn that GIB came up with a small improvement over the line of play that is recommended in that deal's Bridge Movie.

pg| ***** 2 ***** |


pc|SQ|at|Bridge Master as West selected the @SQ as its opening lead. Think about how you would play this hand as the declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|nt|The key to making 3NT on this deal is to try to maximize your chances of winning 5 diamond tricks. If you can win 5 diamond tricks then 9 tricks will be easy |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


ls|sd|ls|nd|hc|saskhaca|at|since the @SA, @SK, @HA, and @CA represent 4 certain winners. |

nt|In a vacuum, this would be the correct way to play the diamond suit for 5 winners as this play guards against 4 diamonds to the @DQ in East's hand. Bridge Master, however, abhors a vacuum. The right play if the diamond suit were in isolation is very much the wrong play on this deal. Can you see why? |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|nt|The reason is that, if the diamond suit is layed out as above, East can rise with the @DQ |

pg| ***** 12 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|eh|hs|nh|at|and switch to a heart to take out the last entry from the dummy before the declarer is able to unblock the diamonds. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|eh|up|7|hs|ed|at|Unless the declarer finds a very lucky layout of the heart suit, the contract can never be made on this line when East has 4 diamonds to the @DQ.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


ls|ed|Hs|wd|md|0,dq,,d7|nt|What's worse is that the line of play just described will fail when one of the defenders was dealt a singleton @DQ. This is a layout that the solution recommended by Bridge Master will pick up. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


ls|wd|hs|ss|at|The "official solution" is to win the first trick with the @SA in the closed hand |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |

pg| ***** 19 ***** |

ls|nd|pc|d3|pc|d7|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|nh|Hs|ws|Hs|wh|at|On the given layout of the diamond suit, the defense is helpless. The dummy still has 2 entries (the @SK and the @HA) and West can only disrupt one of these entries with his return. Suppose that West returns a spade to dummy's @SK (as good as anything). |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |

hs|ss|nt|When GIB was the declarer, it found an interesting variation to the "official solution". GIB did win the first trick with the @SA, |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


ls|Ss|pc|S3|pc|S4|pc|SA|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


hs|sc|at|but it departed from the recommended line when it cashed the @CA at trick 2! |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


ls|sc|pc|ca|at|Can you think of any reason why GIB would play this way? |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


hs|ed|md|0,cj,,dq|nt|GIB cashed the @CA at trick 2 because it was able to "think" of a distribution in which it could guard against East holding 4 diamonds to the @DQ. |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


ls|Ed|hs|ec|at|GIB realized that if one of the defenders had been dealt a singleton @CK, |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |

pg| ***** 40 ***** |


hs|nd|Hs|sd|at|Now it would be safe to lead a diamond toward the closed hand. |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|pc|d3|hs|ed|nt|On this layout East would take his @DQ, |

ls|ed|pc|dq|pc|d2|pc|d7|

hs|nd|Hs|sd|at|leaving the diamond suit blocked. |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|hs|nh|Hs|ns|hs|eh|hs|es|at|However, the dummy still has 2 entries and East can only take out one of them. He might as well play a spade to the dummy's @SK. |

pg| ***** 46 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|at|If this position had arose, then GIB would have continued by unblocking the @DJ, |

ls|nd|ls|sd|pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|dj|pc|h8|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |

pg| ***** 54 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|hs|ed|at|so GIB accurately reverted to the recommended line by ducking a diamond at trick 3. When it turned out that East had the singleton @DQ, |
