^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 317 - October 7, 2002^*N
^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
This week's deal is a declarer play problem that was faced by ^*BIra Rubin^*N during a recent high stakes IMP match in New York City.

Ira has been one of the leading bridge players and personalities in the United States since the 1950s. Although he does not play very much in tournaments these days, Ira's bridge skills are still very strong (as you will see from how he played this week's deal). Ira has also made some serious contributions to bidding theory. His ideas about the game have helped shape the way that Standard American has developed.

Besides having an outstanding tournament record that has spanned several decades, Ira is equally well known for his colorful personality. His fierce devotion to 4-card majors and his equally fierce temper when his partner errs combine to make Ira a rarity in the modern age of bridge (where 5-card majors and being nice to your partner are very much the norm).

nt|I do not know the exact bidding or spot cards for this week's deal, but Ira ended up as declarer in 6@S with the opponents silent throughout. I have constructed an auction that Ira would likely disapprove of, but the play is the thing in this week's deal. |

pc|DK|at|West's opening lead was the @DK. Think about how you would play this hand as declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|As far as I can tell, there are 2 reasonable ways to play this hand. The odds of success of these 2 lines are very close. My computer tells me that the line that I thought of when I was given this problem is less than 3% better than Ira's line. Despite being slightly inferior, Ira's line (which did not even occur to me) is much more creative than the line that I chose. |

Do you know how he played this hand?|
