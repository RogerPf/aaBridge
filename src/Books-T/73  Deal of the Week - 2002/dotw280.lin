^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 280 - January 21, 2002^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played last week during the first round match of the ^*BCap Gemini Ernst & Young Word Top Pairs^*N in The Hague, The Netherlands. There are many things about the Cap Gemini that make it the best bridge tournament of them all: the quality of the field and the sportsmanship of the players, the high level of interest among Dutch bridge players, the elegance of the Hotel Des Indes, and the fact that every detail has been perfectly arranged by ^*BHenk van Dalen^*N and his hard-working team.

We always try to portray bridge in a positive light in ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N, but the Cap Gemini fully deserves this praise - it really is a ^*Bvery^*N special event. The 2002 Cap Gemini was the 16th edition of this tournament and we are very sad to report that it may also be the last. Cap Gemini Ernst & Young will not be sponsoring this bridge tournament next year and, unless the Dutch Bridge Federation is able to find another corporate sponsor, there will be no World Top Pairs event in The Hague next January.

^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N has had the honor of being invited to play in the Cap Gemini 3 times (including 2002 with World Champion ^*BLew Stansby^*N as his partner). Unfortunately Fred has never scored well in this tournament. The good news is that the field is so strong at the Cap Gemini that it is not really embarassing to be near the bottom of the pack - there are always a few World Champions down there with you!

We would like to extend our personal thanks to Henk, his staff, and Cap Gemini Ernst and Young for their years of support and for showing the world how a bridge tournament should be run.

The big news at the 2002 Cap Gemini came from Norway. ^*BGeir Helgemo^*N and ^*BTor Helness^*N won the event convincingly, thereby becoming the only pair in history to have won the Cap Gemini 3 times. The other Norwegian entry ^*BBoye Brogeland^*N and ^*BEric Saelensminde^*N had a strong last match (against Fred and Lew) to win an exciting battle for second place.

Full coverage of the 2002 Cap Gemini, including ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N presentations of every deal at every table, is available through:

There was also a free live vugraph broadcast of the 2002 Cap Gemini that was available through ^*BBridge Base Online^*N. We ran into some technical problems on the first day, but after that everything went smoothly. We received a lot of positive feedback about this broadcast and we will certainly be doing more of them in the future (including the ^*BCavendish Invitational^*N in May).

sk|s|nt|First we will look at this deal from ^*BZia Mahmood's^*N point of view. Zia, from Pakistan, New York City, and London, is well known as one of the best bridge players and of one the most colorful bridge personalities there is . Zia was playing with Great Britain's finest, Andrew Robson, when this week's deal was played. Zia and Andrew won both the 2000 and 2001 Cap Geminis.|

mb|1C|mb|P|mb|1N|mb|?|
nt|Fred, West, dealt and opened 1@C (playing 5-card majors and 15-17 1NT openings). Andrew passed and Lew responded 1NT. Both sides were vulnerable and the Cap Gemini is scored using IMPs. What call do you think Zia made as South?|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Zia make?^^d|mb|d|nt|Zia chose to double, defined as a takeout of clubs in his partnership with Andrew. Zia was not concerned about his meager high card values for 2 reasons. First, the spot cards and honor layout of Zia's hand made it worth more than his point count suggested. Second, Zia thought that it was likely that his side would have a fit somewhere, giving him some safety at the 2-level. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|We think that it is clearly winning bridge to take action in this position and double (as usual) is the most flexible action. Overcalling 2@S takes hearts, diamonds, and defending 1NT doubled out of play. A Michaels Cuebid of 2@C is not only a distortion of your hand (as you should have 5-5 in the majors), but will result in some heart contracts on hands that belong in spades.|

hs|ss|nt|Fred passed and Andrew cuebid 2@C, doubled by Lew. Although Zia and Andrew had not discussed this auction, Zia suspected that Andrew was trying to pass the ball back to him. Well if Andrew wanted Zia to suggest a trump suit, Zia had a clear choice. |

ls|ss|pc|CK|
nt|Fred led the @CK (King from Ace-King or King-Queen) and Andrew put down an interesting dummy. Andrew's hand was strong enough to consider sitting for Zia's double of 1NT, but his weakness in clubs suggested bidding. Andrew could have just bid 2@D, of course, but he thought the odds of finding the best trump suit would be improved if he brought Zia back into the equation.|

ls|es|ls|ed|ls|ec|up|16|

hs|nh|hs|sh|hs|es|nt|Fred really should have found the winning defense on this deal, but Zia should not have given him that chance! There are a variety of ways to make 2@S against any defense. Zia was travelling down a winning path until the point at which he led a diamond toward the dummy. If Zia had led a 3rd round of hearts for Lew to ruff at this point, he can always prevail.|

nt|The deal was played at 8 tables during the 2002 Cap Gemini. The contract was 2@S at 1 other table. Here ^*BHoward Weinstein^*N of the United States was the declarer (^*BSteve Garner^*N was his partner) with the tough Indonesian pair of ^*BFranky Karwur^*N (West) and ^*BDenny Sacul^*N (East) on defense. After ruffing the second round of clubs, Howard led the @D6 toward the dummy.|

hs|es|hs|ss|hs|ws|hs|ns|at|There is actually no defense to defeat 2@S from here (and it would not haved helped for Franky to take the @DA), but Denny's actual return of a trump made things easy for Howard. Franky covered Howard's @S9 with his @SQ and dummy's @SK won the trick. |
