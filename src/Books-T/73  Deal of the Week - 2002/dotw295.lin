^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 295 - May 6, 2002^*N
^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
This week's deal is a declarer play problem based on a deal that was played in this year's Vanderbilt. The world class declarer (who shall remain nameless) facing this problem at the table failed to find the solution. See if you can do better.

This is the first ^*BDeal of the Week^*N that was produced from our new office in Las Vegas. The World Headquarters of ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N is now located at:

|cs|2|at|^-{ 10550 Hope Mills Drive 
 Las Vegas, Nevada
USA   89135 }

If you are visiting Las Vegas and would like to drop into our office for a demonstration of our software (or just to say hello), please give us a call. Our toll free phone number, 1-888-631-9581, will remain the same as it was when our office was in Toronto. This number can be used anywhere in Canada or the United States. Callers from other parts of the world should use (702) 838-4744. These phone numbers can also be used to order any of our software products, but you can also order software through the ^*BSecure Online Shopping^*N area of this web site.

Our business may not be fully operational again until May 10 or so. We apologize for any inconvenience caused as a result of this transition.

The ^*BCavendish Invitational^*N will be held May 8-12 in our new home city of Las Vegas. The prize money available in the Cavendish (generally over 1 million dollars) makes this tournament very unique and many of the world's best players will be competing for a share of this money. 

We will be broadcasting every deal of both the Cavendish Pairs and Teams ^*Blive^*N through ^*BBridge Base Online^*N (BBO). Various experts will be on hand to provide commentary and analysis. Access to this broadcast (not to mention all of the other things that you can do on BBO) is ^*B100% free^*N, but you will need to download and install the BBO software in order to watch the show.

The software that you will need to install BBO on your PC is available as a ^*Bfree^*N download through:

nt|In this week's deal you are the declarer in 3NT after West made a takeout double of your 1@C opening bid. Only East-West are vulnerable. |
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


pc|H2|at|West's opening lead is the @H2 (fourth best). |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


pc|H3|pc|H9|
hs|sh|at|East produces the @H9 and you gratefully and gracefully win the trick with the @HQ (you are a grateful and graceful bridge player right?). |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


ls|sh|pc|HQ|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


sk||hs|eh|hs|wh|nt|Obviously West was dealt both the @HA and @HK and his lead of the @H2 strongly suggests that the defenders' hearts are divided 4-4. It is possible that the @H2 is a falsecard from a 5-card holding, but the fact that West made a takeout double (as opposed to a 1@H overcall) is further evidence of a likely 4-4 heart split. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|wh|hs|ns|hs|ss|hs|ws|nt|West's vulnerable takeout double makes him a strong favorite to hold the @SK. It is therefore likely that you can win 2 tricks in spades without losing the lead, |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|ls|ws|hs|nd|hs|sd|hs|nc|hs|sc|at|but it looks like you will have to establish one of the minors to come anywhere close to 9 tricks. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|wd|at|West rates to have the @DK as well, |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sd|ls|wd|hs|ec|hs|nc|hs|sc|hs|wc|at|but East is a favorite to hold the @CQ (because West rates to be short in clubs). |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


ls|wc|ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|ws|hs|wd|hs|ec|nt|So, while this is far from certain, the above layout of the 3 critical missing honor cards (the @SK, @DK, and @CQ) is quite likely. A reasonable way to approach this problem is to try to figure out a way to make 3NT against this distribution of the East-West cards. Can you see any way to make 3NT on this layout? |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|Hint: this is not a squeeze or endplay deal. This problem is all about timing. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


ls|ec|ls|ws|ls|wd|hs|sd|nt|Many players would instinctively start by cashing the @DA |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


ls|sd|
pc|da|pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|d6|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


hs|sd|at|before leading the @DQ. |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


ls|sd|pc|dq|hs|wd|at|The problem with this line is that West probably has at least 3 diamonds. If this is the case he will allow the @DQ to hold the trick. |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


ls|wd|pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|d3|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|Hs|ws|nt|As the @SA is the only entry to the dummy, it will now be impossible to establish the diamond suit. Furthermore, you can no longer afford to lose a trick in either spades |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|ls|ws|hs|nc|hs|sc|hs|ec|at|or clubs |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|ls|ec|hs|eh|hs|wh|hc|dkskcq|at|as the defense will then be in a position to win 5 fast tricks (3 hearts, the @DK, and either the @SK or the @CQ). In fact, there is no way to make 3NT on the above layout after this start.|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


lc|skdkcq|ls|eh|ls|wh|up|8|hs|sc|hs|nc|hs|ec|nt|Playing clubs from the top will not work any better. |

pg| ***** 23 ***** |


pc|ck|pc|d2|pc|c3|pc|c6|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


pc|cj|pc|s3|pc|c4|hs|ec|at|East can either allow the @CJ to hold (the position will be similar to that which resulted from playing diamonds from the top) or he can win the @CQ. |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


ls|ec|pc|cq|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


hs|nc|at|With dummy's clubs established, you will be up to 8 tricks (assuming a successful spade finesse), but there will be no way to come to a 9th trick against any reasonable defense. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


ls|nc|up|11|md|0,cq,,c9|hs|wc|nt|It is correct to start by cashing exactly one high club on this deal, but only because the @CQ may be singleton. |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |

hs|sd|at|start on diamonds by leading the @DQ without cashing the @DA first. |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


ls|sd|pc|DQ|hs|wd|at|Regardless of whether West wins his @DK or not, the defense will be powerless to defeat the contract. |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |

pg| ***** 34 ***** |


hs|ec|hs|sc|at|and you can now play the same game with East by leading the @CJ (playing a spade to the @SA for a club finesse and then continuing spades is just as good, but not as much fun!). |
