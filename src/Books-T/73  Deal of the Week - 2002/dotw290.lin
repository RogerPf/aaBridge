sk|s|hs|sh|nt|On this week's deal Fred opened 1@H as South. Joey responded 1@S and raised Fred's 3@H rebid to 4@H. The opponents passed throughout. |

hs|ns|at|Peter's opening lead was the @C5 (3rd and 5th best leads) and Joey's dummy contained a surprise for Fred in the spade suit. |
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|Joey's 1@S response was a psych - a deceptive bid intended to make it difficult for the opponents to find a possible fit in spades. Whatever you think of this tactic (we don't think much of it), it doesn't matter now. All that matters now is that you need 10 tricks. Can you see any hope? Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on.|

ls|nh|ls|sh|hs|ss|hs|ns|hs|nd|hs|sd|at|there are still 3 spade losers and 2 diamond losers to deal with. |

hs|ss|hs|nh|nt|Fred saw litle point in playing a second round of spades - the defenders would win and play another trump back, leaving Fred with no chance to make his contract. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


hs|sh|ls|ss|ls|nh|at|Fred therefore decided to run the trumps. He did not have a clear idea of what this would accomplish, but strange things can happen when defenders are forced to make several discards...|

sk||hs|ss|hs|es|hs|ws|at|What happened on the run of the trumps definitely turned out to be strange. Given the actual (slightly miraculous) layout of the spade suit, there was no way the defenders could prevent Fred from coming to a trick in that suit. |

hs|sd|hs|wd|hs|ed|nt|By this point Fred was fairly certain that he had a count on the hand. Both defenders apparently had come down to 2 diamonds and 2 spades. Fred cashed the @DA and it did not matter which of the defenders arranged to win the second round of that suit. |

nt|The main lesson to be learned from this deal is that when a contract seems hopeless, running a long suit can sometimes have unexpected good results. The defenders cannot see all 52 cards. As such, they sometimes make less than optimal discards. Even when all the cards are known, expert players have been known to make the occasional technical error.|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|On some deals (like this one) there is nothing that the defense can do to get out of their own way. Here Peter and Nick discarded as well as they possibly could, but there was no way for the defense to prevent Fred from winning a spade trick at the end. |
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|It is not always necessary to visualize the end position when you start running a long suit. Fred had no idea what was going to happen on this deal until he had played his second last trump. However, he did know that he had nothing to lose by adopting the strategy that he did. It turned out that he had something to gain - an unexpected 10th trick. |
