^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 316 - September 30, 2002^*N
^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played by my partner, ^*BBrad Moss^*N, and it represented one of the few bright spots from my team's dismal performance in the ^*BRoseblum Cup^*N at the recent World Championships in Montreal, Canada. The deal has been rotated to make South the declarer.

The most recent educational software product by ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N is ^*IPOINTS SCHMOINTS!^*N which is based on the best-selling book by the same name that was written by ^*BMarty Bergen^*N. In ^*IPOINTS SCHMOINTS!^*N Marty, a 10-time North American Champion, offers a great deal of practical advice for the average player concerning all aspects of the game. The book upon which this CD-ROM is based was excellent, but the graphics and interactivity of the software version make for a far superior (and far more fun) learning medium.

Another CD-ROM, ^*IMarty Sez^*N, which is based on another highly successful book by Marty Bergen, will be released within the next couple of weeks. ^*IMarty Sez^*N is similar in nature to ^*IPOINTS SCHMOINTS!^*N in that it is also a collection of useful tips that will really help to improve the bridge results of intermediate level players.

nt|East dealt and passed with only North-South vulnerable (the vulnerability is indicated in the top left corner above -- red is vulnerable and white is not vulnerable). Brad, South, had the sort of hand that is tailor made for a strong 1@C system. Unfortunately (at least as far as this deal goes), Brad and I play a natural system and, as such, Brad had a very awkward hand to bid.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


mb|2C|an|Strong, artificial, and forcing|
nt|Brad's hand was too strong to open 1@C in our system, but as I am sure he was aware, the risk of opening hands like these at the 1-level will often be rewarded (provided that 1@C is not passed out) with a smoother auction than that which rates to result from a 2@C opening. In any case, it is hard to be too critical of Brad's decision to open 2@C with his monstrous 23 HCP hand. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


mb|P|mb|2D|an|Artificial non-negative|mb|P|mb|?|nt|West passed and I responded 2@D, an artificial "waiting bid" according to our agreements, but my 2@D also denied a completely hopeless hand. I would have responded 2@H instead of 2@D as an artificial negative if my hand was really awful. I am sure that Brad took some comfort in knowing that I had a little something, but his rebid was still far from clear.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|Brad could bid 3@C now, planning on rebidding 3@S over my likely 3@D or 3@H. There were 2 problems with this plan. First, I would expect either longer or stronger clubs for a sequence like that. Second, I might not be able to bid 3NT over Brad's 3@S and we would then be past what could easily be the best contract. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|Brad therefore judged to treat his hand as balanced, but he thought he was too strong to rebid 2NT (which would suggest 22 or 23 HCP in our system). |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


mb|2h|an|Ariticial relay to 2@S|mb|P|mb|2S|an|Forced|mb|P|
at|His 2@H bid was a convention called the ^*BKokish relay^*N -- an artificial bid that forced me to bid 2@S. |

mb|2N|an|24+ balanced|at|When Brad followed up by bidding 2NT, he showed 24 or more HCP in a balanced hand (other bids by him would show real hearts). |

pg| ***** 9 ***** |


pc|S9|at|West's opening lead was the @S9. The defenders were using ^*BRusinow leads^*N so West's @S9 promised the @S10 and it was possible (at least from East's point of view) that West had a higher spade honor as well. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


pc|S3|pc|S4|at|East followed to the first trick with the @S4. Think about how you would play this hand as declarer before reading on. |

pg| ***** 14 ***** |


ls|nc|hs|ss|hs|sc|hs|sh|hs|nd|at|This problem is unusual because all 4 suits offer possibilities for at least one extra trick. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


ls|sh|ls|sc|ls|nd|at|Brad was fairly confident from the play to the first trick that spades were 3-3. West was unlikely to have led from a doubleton spade and East (who was marked with the @SJ given that West would have lead the @S10 from @SJ109) probably would have unblocked that card from @SJ4 doubleton.|

pg| ***** 21 ***** |


hs|ss|at|The fact that Brad thought that spades were 3-3 was not the only reason that he played 3 rounds of that suit. Part of Brad's reasoning was that knowing how the spades broke might impact his later play. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|When it became clear that Brad's @S5 was a winner, he knew that he needed to develop only 1 more trick to make his contract. |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


ls|ss|hs|nc|hs|sc|at|Since 4 club tricks would be enough for Brad to succeed, he considered how he might play to ensure 9 tricks if that suit broke 4-2. |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|sh|at|He hoped to establish clubs while keeping East off lead as he really wanted to avoid a heart switch through his @HK. |

pg| ***** 39 ***** |


lc|c8|hc|cj|hc|ct|at|Perhaps it is asking a lot of East to go up with the @CJ in this position in an effort to try to win the defenders' club trick. The @CJ would be a very difficult play to find at the table, but I think that it is possible for East to work out to play that card. |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


lc|cj|lc|ct|hc|c9|nt|It would be much less difficult for East to find the falsecard of the @C9. In practice that play would have the same effect as the play of the @CJ. |
