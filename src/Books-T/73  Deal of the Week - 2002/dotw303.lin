^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 303 - July 1, 2002^*N
^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
This week's deal contains something new - an opening lead problem. This is the 303rd ^*BDeal of the Week^*N and, as far as I can remember, this is the first ^*BDeal of the Week^*N to focus on the opening lead (no need to send me e-mail if you discover that I am wrong about this).

This week's deal took place in the semi-finals of the recent ^*BUnited States Bridge Championships^*N. I was playing with my regular partner, ^*BBrad Moss^*N, against ^*BZia Mahmood^*N and ^*BMichael Rosenberg^*N when this week's deal was played. The deal has been rotated to make South the declarer.

at|Michael's 2@D rebid was artificial and forcing to game (^*Bfourth suit forcing^*N) and Zia's next call was 3@S, suggesting a good hand with a least 6 clubs and at least 5 spades. |

nt|Michael's next call was 6@D! Apparently he had been dealt a highly distributional hand with both red suits and wanted Zia to choose between 6@D and 6@H. Zia passed and 6@D became the final contract. |

nt||ls|ws|ls|wh|ls|wd|ls|wc|pc|s7|hs|ns|nt|I chose to lead a spade (the @S7 - the proper count card given that Brad and I use 3rd and 5th best leads against suit contracts). As soon as I Zia layed down his dummy (the spades being the first suit he revealed of course) I was regretting my decision! |

hs|sc|sk||nt|I will discuss the reasoning behind my spade lead soon as well as why I think that the problem that I faced was so interesting. First, however, I will show you what actually happened on this deal (it won't take long). You can now see all 52 cards. Michael won the first trick in the dummy as he discarded the club loser from his hand.|

hs|wd|nt|I think that if you gave my hand as an opening lead problem to a group of experts, most of them would lead a trump without giving the matter much thought. Leading a trump was my first instinct as well, but (unfortunately) I convinced myself that a spade lead would give us a better chance to defeat the contract. |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


hs|eh|hs|nd|hs|sh|nt|The reason that a trump lead seems obvious is that the bidding strongly suggests that the dummy will be 0-2 (or 0-1) in the red suits. It feels like partner will need something in hearts to give the defense a chance and a trump lead will help protect his heart holding by limiting the number of heart ruffs that the declarer will be able to take in the dummy.|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt|Upon further reflection, I realized that leading a trump was essentially playing my partner to be able to win 2 heart tricks. If Brad had a black suit Ace that was cashing, it would almost certainly go away on the other black suit after a trump lead. It seemed that leading a trump amounted to playing Brad for the heart holding headed by the @HAJ or @HKJ.|

hs|ws|hs|es|hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|My spade lead was playing for a layout like the one above where the defense has a spade trick to cash |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|ls|es|ls|ws|hs|eh|hs|sh|at|and where Brad would eventually come to a trick in hearts. |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|sh|hs|ws|at|My hope was that, after leading a spade, |

pg| ***** 35 ***** |


ls|es|pc|sk|pc|sa|pc|s3|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


hs|ed|hs|nd|at|It would then be obvious for Brad to return a trump so that declarer could ruff only 1 heart in the dummy. |

ls|ed|ls|nd|pc|d8|pc|da|pc|d3|pc|d2|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|nc|hs|sh|nt|If this was the actual layout then even Michael Rosenberg would not be able to win 12 tricks after that start. He would be able to discard 3 of his heart losers on dummy's spades and clubs winners, |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|nc|hs|eh|hs|nd|at|but with only 1 heart ruff in the dummy, eventually Brad's @HK would score the setting trick. |

hs|ws|hs|wc|hs|ec|nt|Back to the actual deal, It turned out that the defense did have a black Ace to cash, but it was the @CA, not the @SA as I had hoped. |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|nc|at|Once I convinced myself to lead a black suit (and not a trump), a spade is clearly better than a club (because dummy is known to have more clubs than spades so Michael's black suit singleton rates to be in spades). |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


ls|ws|ls|ns|ls|ec|ls|nc|nt|It turns out that a club opening lead |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


ls|wc|pc|c6|hs|ec|hs|nc|at|would have given the defense a chance, but only if Michael plays me to have underled the @CA! After a club opening lead, if Michael decides to play the @CK from dummy (unlikely), Brad would be able to win the @CA. |

ls|ed|hs|wc|hs|nc|nt|The concept of a club lead (which I did not seriously consider) and Michael playing dummy's @CK at trick 1 is somewhat of a fantasy. |

pc|dj|pc|h8|pc|s8|hs|eh|hs|ec|at|Brad would be ^*Bstrip squeezed^*N on the last round of diamonds. Regardless of what he discarded, Michael would be able to make his contract if he read the position. |
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


ls|ec|hs|sh|nt|A heart discard would allow Michael to play the @HA to drop Brad's @HK. |

hs|nc|hs|Sc|hs|Ec|at|Michael could then lead a club and it would not even matter if he "misguessed" the suit by playing dummy's @CK. Brad would have to win the @CA |

hs|eh|hs|sh|at|and lead a heart away from his @HK at trick 12. |
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|sc|ls|sh|ls|eh|up|43|nt|It is far from clear that Michael would have played this way after a trump lead. It is entirely possible that he would have gone down by discarding his club loser on a spade |
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|sc|hs|sh|at|and playing to set up hearts (by guessing whether to play for @HKxx or @HJxx). Still, it gave me some comfort to know that, with one of the world's great declarers on play, a trump lead might not have defeated 6@D!|
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


hs|eh|hs|sh|nt|I found this an interesting lead problem because I thought that I knew that a trump lead basically amounted to playing my partner for the @HJ, a card that I thought Michael was a big favorite to hold on the bidding. It is most unusual to be faced with a lead problem in which you know so much about the entire deal (especially when the position of a side suit Jack rates to be critical). |
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


hs|ws|ls|sh|ls|eh|nt|Of course my choice of leading a spade required a specific layout to succeed as well, but at the table it felt like a spade lead was the percentage choice. Upon reflection I am not sure if I would make the same lead again, but I doubt very much whether I will ever get another chance to choose an opening lead against this auction!|
