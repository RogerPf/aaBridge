This week's deal took place in the final session of the ^*BWorld Open Pairs^*N during the recent ^*B2002 World Championships^*N in Montreal, Canada. I was the declarer when this week's deal was played. The deal has been rotated to make South the declarer.

The ^*BWorld Open Pairs^*N was a gruelling 13-session event that took place over 6 days. The field (which started with around 250 pairs) was cut roughly in half after 4 qualifying sessions and then cut down to 72 pairs after a 4-session semi-final. The field in the 5-session final included many of the world's best players and partnerships.

Bridge does not get any tougher than it is in the finals of the ^*BWorld Open Pairs^*N. My partner, ^*BBrad Moss^*N, and I flirted with the lead during the first 2 sessions, but we dropped down to 18th place going into the 5th and last session of this event.

No matter how well you play, you need some luck to score well at matchpoints and Brad and I were dealt a ton of luck during the 5th session. If we had taken advantage of all of this luck, we could have finished as high as 3rd place. Unfortunately, we made some costly errors in the last session and we also achieved some ridiculous results by trying too hard to get good boards.

When the smoke cleared we ended up in 14th place. Now 14th in the whole world is not bad at all, but the overall feeling we had was one of disappointment (with ourselves) - if we had just sat there and played steady bridge in the last session it would have been easy for us to finish in the top 5.

This week's deal was one of our triumphs from the final session of the ^*BWorld Open Pairs^*N. More deals from the ^*B2002 World Championships^*N will be reported in upcoming ^*BDeals of the Week^*N.

hs|sh|nt|In this week's deal, East dealt and opened 1@D, promising at least 4 cards in that suit (East-West were playing 5-card majors and 15-17 1NT openings and they would open 1@C with 4432 distribution in a hand either too weak or too strong for 1NT). Since only the opponents were vulnerable, I chose to overcall 4@H as South which became the final contract. |
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


ls|sh|pc|D3|nt|West's opening lead was the @D3. The opponents were using 3rd and 5th best leads, but they would lead the high card from 3 small in this situation. West's diamond holding was therefore likely to be from either @DKJ3, @DKx3, @DJx3, @D32, or a singleton @D3. Think about you would play as declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


hc|hkhjckdadqcasq|nt|There were 19 HCP between my hand and the dummy. That left 21 HCP for the opponents and East surely had the majority of these given his opening bid. It seemed likely to me that East had been dealt a balanced 12-14 HCP hand. If he held a stronger hand (or an unbalanced hand), my 4@H overcall might not have ended the auction.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


lc|hkhjckdadqcasq|hs|nd|nt|If I was right about the general nature of East's hand, West had to have some high cards and it was definitely possible that he had been dealt the @DK. If this was the case then finessing the @DQ at trick 1 would likely lead to 10 tricks. |

pg| ***** 13 ***** |


up|19|ls|sh|ls|sc|hs|nd|at|Finessing the @DQ at trick 1 is certainly the simplest route to 10 tricks on this deal. It also may be the best percentage play even though East is a big favorite to hold the @DK (both because he opened the bidding and because he rated to have 4 diamonds to West's 3). |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt|At the table, however, I was unwilling to finesse the @DQ at trick 1. Both the bidding and my table feel suggested that East had the @DK and, playing matchpoints, I really did not want to go down 2 tricks (which would be the likely result if East won the @DK and returned a trump). |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt|I considered finessing the @D10 at trick 1 as well, but even if the @D10 forced the @DK, a trump return by East would leave me in rather poor shape. What I was looking for was a line of play that would result in at least 9 tricks (and possibly 10) when the @DK was with East. Eventually I saw it. Can you figure out how I played as declarer?|
