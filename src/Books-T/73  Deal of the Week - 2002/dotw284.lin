^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 284 - February 18, 2002^*N 
 ^*BIOC Grand Prix Edition Number 2^*N 
 ^*BMore deals from the round robin^*N }
^-
This week's deal is the second part of my continuing account of the recent ^*BIOC Grand Prix^*N in Salt Lake City. If you have not done so already, I suggest you read part 1 of this series, available as ^*BDeal of the Week 283^*N (February 11, 2002) through this web site. 

I am going to another tournament next week (the ^*BForbo^*N in The Netherlands) and I won't have time to do any work while I am away. I have therefore posted next week's ^*BDeal of the Week^*N (part 3 of this story) a week in advance. It is available now. Please read ^*BDeal of the Week 285^*N when you are finished with ^*BDeal of the Week 284^*N.

I hope you enjoy this week's deals!

Team Canada had upset the United States 23-7 in the first match of the 9-match round robin. My partner, Joey Silver, and I sat out the second match and we were happy to see that our teammates (^*BNick Gartaganis^*N-^*BPeter Jones^*N and ^*BKeith Balcombe-Gord Campbell^*N) scored up another 23-7 win, this time against India.

nt|In the third match Joey and I sat down to play against Australian stars ^*BPaul Marston^*N and ^*BIshmael Delmonte^*N, 2 very fine players. Nothing much happened during the first few boards of the match. Then something happened. I was dealt the glorious South hand and I was in third position at favorable vulnerability. Joey and Ish both passed and it was my turn to call.|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


lb|*MI'm joking right?^Yes~No^2|
lb|*BI'm not joking! What call did I make?^^1H|hs|sh|mb|1H|

nt|Yes, I really opened the bidding 1@H. For those of you unfamiliar with this sort of tactic, my 1@H bid is called a ^*Bpsychic bid^*N (or ^*Bpsych^*N). The rules of bridge define a psych as something like "a deliberate and gross distortion of one's high card values and/or distribution". My action certainly fit that definition!|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|The rules of bridge allow you to psych, but you are not supposed to psych often with the same partner (especially not the same type of psych). I hadn't psyched an opening bid (with the exception of 1NT) for as long as I could remember. In fact, I really don't believe in playing this way and this was a most uncharacteristic action for me to take.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|The reason that I don't believe in psyching is that I prefer to try to win matches by outplaying the opponents. Psychs are randomizers. Sometimes you win a big swing and sometimes you lose a big swing. Sometimes the normal result is achieved. The real problem with psychs, however, is that most partners and teammates do not appreciate it when they don't work.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|Fortunately, I did not have that problem. My partner Joey likes to psych as much as anyone these days. Don't get the wrong impression about us. Neither one of us psyched again until near the end of the tournament (you will read about it). I knew my teammates would understand too. They are good guys and they would know that I was just trying to win.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|Why is 1@H an example of "trying to win"? Good question. I don't know exactly what came over me. I knew Paul had a good hand and the opponents were playing a strong 1@C relay system. I did not want to give them a free ride. All I can say is it felt like the right thing to do at the time. I knew I was doing something random, but hoped to get lucky...|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


mb|D|mb|1N|mb|D|mb|?|

ls|sh|nt|Unlucky! The auction went about as badly as possible! Paul made a takeout double of my 1@H and Joey showed some values with his 1NT (thanks pard!). Ish doubled, of course, and I was now seriously regretting my rather light opening bid. What would you do now? (I know you never would have opened 1@H...).|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call do you think Fred made?^^2C|

hs|sc|mb|2C|

nt|I bid 2@C. First things first. Redouble would not be for rescue in our partnership; it would show a good hand. Pass would be to play. If I wanted to get out of 1NT doubled I was going to have to do so myself. I didn't think I wanted Joey to have to play 1NT doubled, so I ran to 2@C and hoped for the best...|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


mb|D|mb|P|mb|P|mb|?|
nt|I may have been hoping for the best, but I was not very surprised to once again see the worst. Paul doubled 2@C, passed around to me. OK, I suppose it could have been worse - Joey could have bid 2@H, but this was pretty bad too! What now?|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


ls|sc|lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^p|
mb|P|
hs|sc|nt|I chose to pass and 2@C doubled became the final contract. Why did I pass 2@C (as opposed to running to 2@D - the only realistic alternative)? For one thing, my clubs were better than my diamonds. Also, Joey had a natural 2@D bid over Paul's takeout double, but he did not have a natural 2@C bid available (2@C would have been an artificial heart raise). Once again, I could only hope...|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||pc|C9|

hs|nc|hs|sc|at|Paul made the expected trump lead and I finally got something that I had been hoping for! Before Joey put down the dummy he said, "Well I know you don't have good trumps partner". That was exactly what I wanted to hear! |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


mc|5|at|This was the only deal of the 2002 IOC Grand Prix in which I claimed without ever playing a card (5 tricks for -500). |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


sk||
hs|ec|hs|wc|nt|I was interested to see what the opponents had been dealt. The 4-1 club break was a pleasant surprise (I assume that Paul's second double was a further takeout double). It was too bad that neither of the opponents had a long suit, but most of the suits split well and it appeared that East-West would make almost anything they bid.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt|It looked like the only way that we could lose IMPs on this board would be if Gord and Keith played in 3NT on the East-West cards (down on careful defense that could be difficult). That was not completely unlikely - they had no 8-card fit after all. Still, I liked our result on this board and I knew that my partner Joey was smiling on the other side of the screen.

Now please don't get the wrong idea about me and psyching, but I have to admit that I was tempted again a few boards later. Once again I was in third seat at favorable vulnerability and once again both Joey and Ish had passed. My hand was:

^-
|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Fred want to make?^^1N|
lb|*BWhat call did Fred actually make?^^3H|

at|This hand would be a much more "typical" psych for me and, if I were to psych, I prefer 1NT to 1@H. There were 2 main reasons why I chose to make what I considered the normal call of 3@H:

^C@21) I did not want to push my luck.
2) @2The event was very young and I had not played with Joey in a few years. I did not want him to think that I was prone to a lot of undisciplined actions.
@0
Opening 3@H worked out fine. The opponents had an intelligent auction to 4@S, the only game contract with any chance. Still, 4@S needed a lot of luck, which was not there, and went down by 2 tricks. +200 felt like a small plus position for us.

pg| ***** 22 ***** |

hs|sc|sk|s|nt|The match was running out of boards and it felt like we were getting slightly the best of it, when I picked up the South hand above. Both sides were vulnerable and I was the dealer. I opened 1@C. Joey and I play a simple 5-card major system with 15-17 1NT openings. |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


ls|sc|mb|1H|mb|2H|an|Limit raise or better for clubs|mb|2S|mb|?|
at|Paul overcalled 1@H, Joey cuebid 2@H to show at least a limit raise in support of clubs, and Ish bid 2@S. What now?|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^P|mb|P|

nt|I chose to pass, but I gave serious thought to bidding 3@C. Would 3@C suggest a good balanced minimum here? I was not sure. I thought Joey would normally expect a 5th club from me for 3@C. His cuebid had committed our side to at least 3@C so I knew that 2@S would not end the auction. Whether pass or 3@C is correct here is really a matter of partnership agreement and style.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


mb|3S|mb|4C|mb|P|mb|?|
nt|Paul raised to 3@S, Joey competed to 4@C, and Ish passed. Although Joey's 4@C bid was not exactly invitational (as it did not promise more than a good distributional limit raise), my hand had certainly improved greatly. Do you think I went on to game?|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^5C|mb|5C|
hs|sc|nt|I went on to game for a very simple reason: I thought that I could make it. I knew that Joey had a singleton spade and it was likely that he had at least 5 trumps. He was also likely to have a strong holding in diamonds as there were not too many high cards for him to have in the other suits. It felt a bit strange going on to game with a weak notrump in this auction, but it really felt right! |

nt||pc|D5|pc|D3|pc|D2|pc|DJ|

at|Paul came back the @D5 and Ish followed with the @D2. Those diamond spots were interesting. The opponents were playing upside down count and attitude signals and 3rd and 5th best leads. If they were carding honestly then it appeared that the diamonds were 4-2 (probably with Paul having 4). Of course, either or both defenders might have been falsecarding. |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |

nt|If my assumption about the diamonds was correct then Paul had been dealt 3541 distribution. Ruffing with the @C10 would pay big dividends if Paul's singleton club was either the @CJ or the @C9. |

pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|In fact, I was 2 down. There was no way to avoid losing a trick in both spades and clubs. Rats! -200 did not feel good at all! True that we were in a nice contract (5@C requires little more than 3-2 clubs and has chances against some 4-1 breaks), but 5@C was a lot of clubs to bid when you consider our combined high card values and trump fit.|

hs|wh|hs|eh|nt|I thought that we had won this match, but the margin was more than I had expected. Keith and Gord were solidly plus at their table and our scores meshed well. On the deal above where I psyched 1@H as South and went -500 in 2@C doubled, Gord and Keith reached 4@H on the above auction. 4@H is a good play problem after 2 rounds of clubs, but I will spare you the details. |
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|In any case, Gord played the hand carefully and ended up making his contract exactly. +620 was worth 3 IMPs to Canada. A small triumph for the psych! On the deal in which I almost psyched 1NT and wound up +200 against 4@S, Gord and Keith had a huge result. They stopped in 4@D (the limit of the hand), got doubled, and made the contract for +710 and 14 IMPs to Canada!|

nt|Canada lost 3 IMPs on the hand in which I went down -200 in 5@C when trumps were 4-1. The Australians played in 3NT on our cards and were -100. 5@C is a better contract than 3NT on this deal and it was unlucky that we had lost IMPs.|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


nt|The good news was that the 3 IMPs we had lost on this deal represented over a quarter of the total IMPs that we lost in the 12-board match. The final IMP score was Canada 41, Australia 11 which translated into yet another 23-7 win for our team!|

Team Canada had won its third match in a row by a 23-7 margin! We were on top of the leader board. We lost our next match 19-11 to Norway. ^*BTor Helness^*N did a few brilliant things in this match that are worth reading about - perhaps in a future ^*BDeal of the Week^*N.

Our next match was against Italy, one of the pre-tournament favorites. Early in the match I was dealt:

My LHO (^*BGiorgio Duboin^*N) dealt and opened 3@C. Joey overcalled 4@S, and ^*BGuido Ferraro^*N on my right passed. What would you do?

pg| ***** 56 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^4NT|at|I chose to bid 4NT, Roman Keycard Blackwood 1430. I love Blackwood and I am very pleased to tell you that, as a result of playing with me, Joey Silver now loves this convention too! That is pretty serious as Joey has been a lifelong and vocal non-believer in Blackwood.

Joey's 4@S bid showed a very strong hand (typically 8 1/2 or 9 tricks) and a powerful suit. I thought my hand was worth at least a slam try, but I did not think that a 5@C or 5@D cuebid by me would lead to an intelligent auction. 4NT didn't exactly come with any guarantees either, but I thought that 4NT would lead to the most accurate (as well as the most simple) auction for us.

^C{|ih|ps42hqkj95c6dajt73|at|} ^M|cs|1|at|{|ia|3c4sp4np5cp5dp6sp7sppp|at|}

Joey's 5@C bid showed 1 or 4 keycards (it had to be 4 given his 4@S bid). My 5@D asked for the @SQ and Joey's 6@S suggested that he held the @SQ, no side Kings, and extra values in the trump suit. Joey would have cuebid a King if he had been dealt one and he would have bid 5NT if he had the @SQ and nothing else to say. I briefly considered bidding either 7@H or 7NT, but Joey's 6@S suggested that he either had a 7-card spade suit or the @SJ. As such I placed the contract in 7@S with reasonable confidence.

It turns out that Joey had 7 spades to the @SAKQ98 and, when that suit broke in a civilized manner, 7@S was easy. Of course, it came as no surprise to learn that ^*BAlfredo Versace^*N and ^*BDano de Falco^*N had also bid to 7@S on our cards to push the board.

The Italians seemed to do everything right at both tables in this match. I thought we had lost, our teammates thought we had lost, and sure enough we lost. We lost convincingly scoring only 7 IMPs to Italy's 42. It is not the end of the world to lose close matches in an event of this nature, but the 6 Victory Points we got against Italy (versus their 24) was a major setback for Team Canada.

|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


nt|
Italy had passed us in the standings, but thanks to our excellent start, Canada was still in second place. The last match of the second day was a real test of character for our team. Joey and I were not really put to the test as we went to the bar instead of playing. The rest of the team faced the always dangerous Indonesians who were fighting hard for a qualifying spot. The other 4 members put a stop to our losing streak, getting a 16-14 Victory Point win against Indonesia.

Now 16-14 is not really a big win in terms of Victory Points, but it was a big win for our team. For one thing, beating Indonesia at all is an accomplishment. The fact that we were now supposed to be "feeling the pressure" and came through without our 2 most experienced players in the lineup was more important. The rest of the world was starting to learn that Canada was for real.

On the last day of the round robin we would play matches against Brazil, Poland, and Egypt. As long as our team was close to average in these 3 matches we would have a good chance to qualify (in the top 4) for the semi-finals. Were we feeling any pressure yet? It didn't seem like it. The guys on my team were playing and behaving like they had been here many times before!

His regular partner these days is 27 year old ^*BDiego Brenner^*N, one of the game's brightest young stars. Early in the match Joey was dealt a hand that should look familiar.|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


mb|?|nt|You will recall that, in our match against Australia, I also had a 2722 hand with 7 hearts headed by the @HJ108. I also had a side Ace (the @SA). I was in third position at favorable vulnerability and, despite being tempted to psych, opened a "normal" 3@H. On this deal Joey was also at favorable vulnerability, but he was in first position. What call do you think he made?|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


ls|wh|ls|wd|lb|*BWhat call did Joey make?^^P|mb|p|
nt|Joey chose to make a disciplined pass. My partner is a big believer in never holding an outside Ace (and usually not an outside King either) for a first or second seat preempt. I cannot say that I agree with this principle (I would have opened 3@H myself), but that is just the way that Joey plays. I don't really care what my partner's style on preempts is - as long as I know what to expect.|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


mb|p|mb|?|sk|e|
nt|Now let's look at this deal from my (East's) point of view. Try to ignore the fact that you know what my partner's hand is. Joey and Diego both passed and it was up to me. Our side was at favorable vulnerability. What call do you think I made?|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^3C|mb|3c|hs|ec|
nt|I chose to open 3@C - another in a series of less than classic preempts. I would have opened 1@C with this hand in first or second position, but in third position at this vulnerability, my mission was to obstruct. 1@C is not exactly what I call an obstructive bid!|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


nt|If you are wondering how I can preempt on such a wide variety of hands without driving my partner crazy, that is a good thing to wonder. My partners avoid going crazy by always playing me for a "normal" hand. If I have something else that is my problem not my partner's. If you choose to mix up your preempts this much, make sure you are playing with a sympathetic partner!|

at|You can now see all 52 cards. Both Joey and I took questionable actions on the first round of bidding. It turns out that the whole deal was about the @DJ and the bidding decisions that we made created a situation where even Gabriel Chagas was not going to guess that card.|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


nt|Of course we didn't know at the time that our actions had this effect, but it turns out that either a 3@H opening by Joey or a 1@C opening by me may well have steered Gabriel in the right direction. What does this prove? Only that when you're hot, you're hot!|
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


nt|And that is really what I think winning major bridge tournaments is all about - just doing the right thing more often than the opponents. At this level everyone has good bidding judgment and everyone can take their tricks. It's just a matter of whose day it is. If it's your day you will probably win. Today seemed like our day. I could only hope that it would continue!|

nt|At the table I was not certain what Joey was doing when he bid 3@H. If he had bid 2@H instead he would have been suggesting a 3-card limit raise. That would argue for his jump to be forcing. In any case, I did not want to waste a lot of energy figuring out what 3@H "should" mean. I was bidding 4@H no matter what, so I bid 4@H which became the final contract.|mb|P|mb|4H|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|

It would then be impossible for Gabriel to misread the position.|

It was a lot of trouble to go to for "only an overtrick," but sometimes those overtricks turn into victory points...|

nt|It was time to compare and once again Nick and Peter had enjoyed a strong game. One of their few sub-par results came on the deal in which Gabriel had gone down in 4@S after misguessing the @DJ. Nick and Peter stopped in 3@S, making 4, and were concerned about losing a vulnerable game swing. They were happy to see that we had won 7 IMPs on the board.|

Nick and Peter did well to get to the good 6@C on this deal to earn a slam swing for Canada. In their auction above, Peter's 2@C was forcing to game and Nick did something that you don't see very often. He bid Roman Keycard Blackwood with a void in the agreed trump suit. He was rewarded for his good judgment when trumps broke 3-2 and 6@C made.

Both teams won a couple of small swings and Canada was ahead by 9 IMPs (18-12 in Victory Points) going into the last board.

nt|This was the deal where I made an overtrick in 4@H. Nick and Peter held that contract to 10 tricks at the other table. Canada thus won 1 IMP on this board to win the match by 10 IMPs and 1 extra Victory Point (19 for us, 11 for Brazil)!

pg| ***** 127 ***** |


bt||nt|So, contrary to popular opinion, overtricks do matter at IMPs. Every Victory Point counted at this stage of the event. Canada was sitting in 3rd place with 2 matches to go. We were 13 VPs ahead of 5th place Poland. 13 VPs is a sizable gap at this late stage, but we could not afford to be comfortable - especially as we were about to play Poland!

Poland versus Canada turned out to be another low-scoring match. Poland won 24-19 in IMPs, but only 16-14 in Victory Points. The other matches also went well for Canada and we were all but mathematically assured of a qualifying spot going into the last match. Wow!

Nick rested Joey and I during the last match (against Egypt) and both partnerships had some anxious moments during this match. We got trounced - 24-6 in VPs, but we knew that we only needed 5 VPs to be assured of qualifying.  When the smoke cleared, Canada was sitting in 4th place with 140.7 VPs. Italy had won the round robin easily with the awesome score of 179 VPs. Norway finished second with 144.3 VPs and Poland finished in third, just ahead of us with 141.5 VPs. Indonesia was the highest non-qualifier with 135 VPs.

For the members of Team Canada, getting to the final four was something that none of us had really expected. It was a serious thrill to have come this far and the excitement was not about to let up. Italy, by virtue of winning the round robin, was entitled to chose their semi-final opponents from among the other 3 qualifiers. Nobody was surprised, of course, when they selected Canada. Italy would enjoy a 6 IMP carryover into our 48-board semi-final.

We know we are big favorites to lose this match, but stranger things have happened...
