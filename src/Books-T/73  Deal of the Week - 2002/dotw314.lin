nt|^*BJudy Gartaganis^*N from Calgary, Alberta, Canada, is a refreshing rarity in the world of bridge. Judy is one of the few women in the world who has the skill and desire to compete (and contend) in high level open bridge events. Judy and her husband, Nick, along with ^*BGord Campbell^*N and ^*BKeith Balcombe^*N have been the most consistently successful team in the ^*BCanadian National Team Championships^*N (CNTC) during the past 5 years.

The Gartaganis Team won the 2001 CNTC, thereby qualifying to represent Canada at the ^*B2002 IOC Grand Prix^*N in Salt Lake City. Unfortunately there were 2 separate events in Salt Lake City, one for men and one for women. Judy was thus unable to play with her regular partner and teammates at the IOC Grand Prix.

Regular readers of ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N will know that ^*BPeter Jones^*N was added to Team Canada to play with Nick and that myself and ^*BJoey Silver^*N were added as a 3rd pair. The field at the IOC Grand Prix was filled with stars from all over the world, but Canada shocked everyone (including ourselves) when we emerged with the Gold Medal.

While this was a glorious victory for all of Canadian bridge players, the team (especially Nick, Keith, and Gord) experienced some sadness in that Judy, who had been an integral part of their team, was not allowed to play with them in Salt Lake City.

Later in 2002, at the ^*BCommonwealth Games^*N in Manchester, England, the Gartaganis Team had another chance to represent Canada in a major international event. This time Judy was allowed to play with her regular teammates. I am thrilled to report that the result was the same - another Gold Medal for Canada. What a year for the Gartaganis Team and for Canadian bridge! I must say that these fine people and fine players fully deserve all of their recent success!

nt|This week's deal, which has been rotated to make South the declarer, took place in the finals of the 2002 Commonwealth Games. Judy, South, was the declarer in 4@S after she and Nick conducted the Precision auction shown above. Judy and Nick faced 2 of England's brightest stars, ^*BJohn Armstrong^*N (West) and ^*BTony Forrester^*N (East), when this week's deal was played. |

Well done Judy and congratulations to the whole Gartaganis team!|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


ls|nd|hs|ns|up|20|nt|Here is an interesting variation in the play of this deal. At the point in the play where Judy drew a third round of trump, |

pg| ***** 49 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|pc|s5|hs|es|at|The fascinating thing about this position is that it actually matters which spade Tony plays now! |
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|If Tony were to follow with the @S9 in this variation, |
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


ls|es|pc|s9|hs|ss|at|Judy could come out on top, but only if she plays the @SQ from her hand! |
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


ls|ss|pc|sq|pc|d|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


hs|ss|hs|nd|hs|es|at|She could then continue by exiting with the @S10 and discarding a diamond from the dummy. Tony would have to win the @SJ |
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


ls|es|ls|ss|ls|nd|pc|st|pc|cj|pc|d2|pc|sj|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|nh|hs|ed|at|and give dummy 2 of the last 3 tricks with the @DK and the @H8. |
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


up|6|ls|nh|ls|nd|ls|ed|hs|ss|nt|The play of winning the @SQ instead of the @S10 in the above position is known as a ^*Btrump gambit^*N. A gambit is the deliberate loss of 1 trick in order to win at least 2 tricks that would not otherwise have been available. One of my personal heroes, ^*BMichael Rosenberg^*N, claims that the rare trump gambit is one of the most difficult plays for an expert to recognize at the table.|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


up|1|hs|es|ls|ss|nt|Judy certainly played this deal correctly in my view, but in the fantasy line that we have been exploring, consider the effect of the play of the @SJ by Tony on the third round of trump. |
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


ls|es|pc|sj|hs|ss|at|The effect of this play is that it now becomes impossible for the declarer to lose a trick on the fourth round of trump - gambit denied! |
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


nt|The best that the declarer can do in this variation is to win the @SQ |
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


ls|ss|pc|sq|pc|d3|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


hs|ss|hs|es|hs|nh|At|and draw the last trump, discarding the @H8 from the dummy. |

ls|ss|ls|Es|ls|nh|pc|st|pc|cj|pc|h8|pc|s9|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


hs|Wd|hs|nd|hs|sd|hs|ed|at|Now the defense will come to 3 damond tricks in the ending, provided that West is careful to cover whatever diamond the declarer leads out of the South hand (if West does not cover, then East will be endplayed). |
