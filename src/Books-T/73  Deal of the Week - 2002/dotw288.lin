^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 288 - March 18, 2002^*N }
^-
I just finished playing 10 days of bridge at the ^*NACBL Spring North American Championships^*N in Houston and, as I am sure you can imagine, I got to see (and play) a lot of interesting deals. This week's deal was my personal favorite from Houston.

This week's deal took place in the 2nd last match of the North American Swiss Teams on Sunday. My team (partner ^*BBrad Moss^*N, ^*BRoy Welland^*N-^*BBjorn Fallenius^*N, and ^*BHoward Weinstein^*N-^*BSteve Garner^*N) was essentially tied for first at this point with the team of ^*BPerry Johnson^*N-^*BJeff Meckstroth^*N and ^*BEric Rodwell^*N-^*BPaul Soloway^*N going into this match. Our 2 teams had a pretty good lead over the rest of the field so there was a good chance that the winner of this match would go on to win the event.

nt|I particularly wanted to win this match as our team lost early in the week to Meckstroth-Rodwell and Soloway (and with ^*BBob Hamman^*N, Soloway's partner, and ^*BNick Nickell^*N-^*BDick Freeman^*N. The stakes were higher in that match as it took place in the Quarter Finals of the Vanderbilt, the premier event at the Spring Nationals. 

Our team led by 34 IMPs after 32 boards of that 64-board match and our team was playing well. In the third quarter, however, it felt like Brad and I had been hit by a truck after playing against Meckstroth and Rodwell. They played about as well as I have ever seen anyone play and the hands came up well for their style. We were outscored 65-0(!) over 16 boards and got knocked out. The Nickell team eventually lost in the Final of the Vanderbilt to a team captained by our friend ^*BReese Milner^*N (and partner ^*BMarc Jacobus^*N, ^*BSam Lev^*N-^*BJohn Mohan^*N, and ^*BPiotr Gawrys^*N-^*BJacek Pszczola^*N). Congratulations Reese (and team) on a great win!

Well, beating these guys in a 7-board match to win the North American Swiss would not really compensate for our loss to them in the Vanderbilt, but this would be my only chance for revenge for a while. Brad and I sat down to face Paul Soloway and Eric Rodwell. Although these two are not regular partners, they have played together a lot over the years. Paul and Eric are both among the very best and most successful players in the world and I suspected (correctly as it turned out) that we would not gain much due to their lack of a regular partnership.

The match was going just fine until this week's deal came along. I hope you enjoy it!

nt|I was dealt the strange hand that you see above. Nobody was vulnerable and Brad, the dealer, opened 1@H. Paul passed and I had to decide what bid to make. 2@C would be forcing to game in our partnership while a 1NT response would be ^*Bsemi-forcing^*N (meaning that Brad would only pass with a very minimum 5332 hand).|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Fred made?^^2c|
hs|sc|mb|2c|

nt|I chose to overbid with 2@C. In my view this in only an invitational hand (which is why my game forcing 2@C was an overbid), but there was no good invitational sequence available that would allow us to explore for fits in both spades and clubs. |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|I consider a 1@S response to be the worst response on this hand. 1@S will probably work out if partner has 4 spades, what would you do if your partner rebid 2@D or 2@H (or...)? If you bid your clubs next you will be forcing to game and if you are willing to do that then you might as well bid your long suit first!|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|For Brad and me a 1NT response was a viable option. One of the big problems with 2/1 Game Force is that the system does not deal with invitational hands very well. Brad and I play some fancy conventions that give us the ability to show both invitational and signoff hands in either minor after a 1NT response, but there were 2 reasons why I rejected this call.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|First, as a 1NT response is semi-forcing, Brad could pass. I suspected that 1NT was not where I wanted to play on this deal. The other reason why I rejected a 1NT response was that this call makes it impossible to find a 4-4 spade fit (unless Brad is strong enough to reverse into 2@S at his next turn).|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|Here is a useful tip: It is sometimes good strategy at IMP scoring to overbid on complex distributional hands. Sometimes you will get too high and go down in game, but if there is a game in the cards you will at least be able to find the best trump suit more often if you bid out your hand as naturally as possible. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


ls|sc|hs|ss|mb|P|mb|2H|mb|P|mb|2S|
nt|Eric passed and Brad rebid 2@H, a "denial bid" in our style. By this I mean that Brad's 2@H did not suggest a 6-card heart suit (though he might well have one). 2@H merely denied the ability to make any other natural call (such as 2@D for example - Brad's 2@H denied 4 diamonds). I had been hoping that the bidding would go this way and I now showed my second suit with 2@S.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


mb|P|mb|2N|mb|P|mb|3C|
ls|ss|hs|sc|
nt|Brad's next call was 2NT, showing a diamond stopper (and denying the ability to raise either spades or clubs). Perfect! The auction had worked out very well for me and I was now able to suggest my long clubs at a convenient level. I bid 3@C with some confidence. Yes, I had overbid, but at least I was getting my shape across to Brad.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


mb|P|mb|3D|mb|P|mb|4C|
nt|Brad's next call was 3@D. For us 3@D suggested a holding like @DAxx and uncertainly about notrump. Brad could not have both the @CA and the @CK so 3NT could not be the right contract. A lot of 2/1 players would bid 5@C here to show a weaker hand than 4@C, but for Brad and I 5@C would suggest a much stronger suit. In our partnership 4@C was pretty much forced on me here.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt|At this point I had no idea whether Brad had a strong hand or not and my hand was pretty much unlimited as well. If Brad liked his hand for clubs he would cuebid now (I would sign off in 5@C). I am not sure if I would have passed or bid 5@C if Brad had bid 4@H next. Fortunately I did not have that problem...|

ls|sc|hs|nd|hs|nh|at|Brad would not open most 5332 11 counts, but the quality of his hearts and the 2 Aces make his hand an automatic 1@H in our style. |

Yes, we bid too much and we were in a very poor contract. You can worry about that later. Worry about winning 11 tricks now. Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on. |

nt|If you think that your only real technical chance is to hope that the spades are 3-3 and that Eric was dealt a singleton @CK, then you are right! The odds of this are in the 2% range, however, and I thought of a non-technical chance that I thought would offer better odds than that. Can you see what I did?|

nt|At the other table Jeff Meckstroth and Perry Johnson managed to stop sensibly in 3@C on our cards. They were +130 so our team lost 6 IMPs on this deal. That was not the end of the world, but we lost 2 major swings elsewhere in the match to lose convincingly. This deal was hardly a triumph, but it was a lot of fun to play!|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|The Johnson team also won their last match handily to coast to the win the 2002 North American Swiss Teams. Almost getting blitzed in the 2nd last match was a big setback for my team, but we scored a big win in our last match (against team Meltzer - the reigning Bermuda Bowl Champions) to hold on to 2nd place. More hands from Houston will appear in upcoming ^*BDeals of the Week^*N.|
