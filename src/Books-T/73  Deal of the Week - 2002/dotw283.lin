 ^*BIOC Grand Prix Edition Number 1^*N }

|cs|1|at|^-{ ^*BCanada wins Gold Medal at IOC Grand Prix in Salt Lake City!^*N }
^-
^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N (the author of ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N) was part of the Canadian Team for this event. The next several ^*BDeals of the Week^*N will be an account of Fred's experiences in Salt Lake City. These accounts will be written in the first person and, unlike most ^*BDeals of the Week^*N, will focus on deals that were critical in this event (as opposed to deals that are technically complex).

The IOC Grand Prix has traditionally been held at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland. The World Bridge Federation hopes that this event (especially the 2002 edition which coincided with the Winter Olympics) will help convince the International Olympic Committee to accept bridge as an Olympic sport. Regardless of whether or not they are successful in this regard, the WBF should be commended for running a fine event and attracting a great deal of media attention at the 2002 IOC Grand Prix.

10 mens teams, 10 womens teams, and 4 junior teams were invited to Salt Lake City. My partner ^*BJoey Silver^*N and I played for Canada in this event. The rest of our team consisted of ^*BNick Gartaganis^*N (our Captain) playing with ^*BPeter Jones^*N, and ^*BGord Campbell^*N playing with ^*BKeith Balcombe^*N. The event consisted of a complete round robin of 12 board matches with 4 teams qualifying for a 48-board semi-final followed by a 48-board final.

The word on the street was that Canada was unlikely to make the final 4 as it was expected that 6 very strong teams (Brazil, Indonesia, Italy, Norway, Poland, and the United States) would battle it out for the top 4 spots. The other 4 teams (Australia, Canada, Egypt, and India) were not expected to be a factor in this event.

While I did not exactly think we were a favorite to qualify in the top 4, I knew we had a chance. I knew from experience that it was possible for a team like ours to defeat the best teams in the world. Also, I had a lot of confidence in my partnership with Joey and, while my teammates were almost totally lacking in international experience, they had a few things going for them:

1) They have been the most consistent team in the Canadian National Teams Championships over the last 5 years or so. They always seem to advance well into the knockout phase of this event and they won the 2001 CNTC (thereby earning the right to play in Salt Lake City). Having lost convincingly to the Gartaganis team in the 1998 CNTC, I knew that these guys could play.

2) I knew that everyone on the team would be good partners and teammates through thick and thin. This is important as there are bound to be both thick and thin moments in a bridge touranment like the IOC Grand Prix. Receiving support from your partner and teammates during thin times is conducive to winning bridge tournaments.

3) I knew that our captain, Nick Gartaganis, had all of the necessary qualities to do his job well. Nick is well-organized, good with people, and good at strategy. Furthermore, he had the respect of the rest of the team and was quite capable of separating his ego as a bridge player from the lineup decisions that he was going to have to make.

nt|This is the first hand that I was dealt in the 2002 IOC Grand Prix. Canada faced the powerful American team in the first match and Joey and I were assigned the difficult task of taking on my friends ^*BDavid Berkowitz^*N and ^*BLarry Cohen^*N on vugraph. David and Larry are both great individual players and together make up one of America's most successful partnerships.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


mb|2D|an|Precision - 3-suiter short in diamonds|
nt|David, North, was the dealer and neither side was vulnerable. He opened 2@D, which, in the Precision system that they use, suggested a minimum opening bid with at most a singleton diamond and length in the other 3 suits (possible distributions were 4441, 4405, 4315, and 3415). |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


mb|P|mb|3C|an|Signoff|mb|?|
at|Joey passed as East and Larry signed off in 3@C. It was my first call of the tournament. |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^P|mb|P|
hs|wh|nt|I passed, not really considering this much of a problem. This is, in some ways, a balancing situation as Larry's 3@C would usually end the auction. While it could be argued that my hand was strong enough for a balancing 3@H overcall, I rejected this call due to David's opening bid - a warning that suits were not going to break well. |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


ls|wh|mb|P|mb|D|an|Takeout of clubs|
nt|I felt that it was too dangerous for me to bid and I knew that Joey would still have a chance to get our side into the auction. That is exactly what happened. Joey doubled for takeout - a pleasant surprise as my own hand and the nature of the auction suggested that Joey would rarely have enough high cards and distribution to be able to enter the bidding with any safety.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


mb|R|mb|?|

hs|wh|nt|Well I certainly had a much better hand than Joey had a right to expect and I was all set to express this with a jump to 4@H when Larry redoubled, giving me pause for thought. Evidently Larry thought he could make 3@C. Should I allow this new information to impact my decision?|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^4H|mb|4H|

nt|I chose to ignore Larry's redouble and make the same 4@H bid that I had planned to make if he had passed. It is best to trust your partner (and not the opponents) in a situation like this. Joey also knew that suits were not breaking, but he still judged to come in at the 3-level. He should have sound values. As for Larry, I was not sure what he was up to, but he was not there to help me.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


ls|wh|mb|P|mb|P|mb|5C|nt|I half expected 4@H to get doubled, but David actually passed (as did Joey) and Larry bid 5@C at his next turn. |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


mb|D|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|

at|I chose to double 5@C, even though I had no idea how we were going to defeat that contract. The main reason that I doubled was that Larry and David had already volunteered to play in 3@C - I didn't think that it was likely that they would do this if they could win 11 tricks. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


hs|ws|hs|wd|hs|wh|hs|wc|nt|
5@C doubled was the final contract and I now had to find an opening lead. A case could be made for leading from each of the 4 suits. What card do you think I led as West? |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


lb|*CWhat card did Fred lead?^^c7^cj7hqj864s53dak64|ls|wc|ls|wd|ls|wh|ls|ws|hc|c7|

nt|I chose to lead the @C7 for 2 reasons. First, I knew dummy was short in diamonds and I suspected that Larry was short in hearts - a trump lead might limit declarer's ability to cross ruff. Second, I suspected that a trump lead would be uninformative, making it more difficult for Larry to guess the location of any missing high cards. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt|Why the @C7 as opposed to the @CJ? I have learned from experience not to "waste" high trumps in situations like this one - sometimes a card like the @CJ will come into play in mysterious ways if you hold on to it. I didn't exactly have any strong convictions that the @C7 would be the best lead for the defense, but it really felt right at the table.|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||lc|c7|pc|C7|

hs|nc|hs|nh|at|I was not very pleased by the site of the dummy. David's 5 strong trumps and no wasted values in hearts (opposite Larry's shortness) was not a good sign for Team Canada. Larry had bought very well and it felt like it would be a real struggle to defeat this doubled contract. |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


hs|es|ls|nc|ls|nh|hs|ns|hs|ss|sk||nt|You can now see all 52 cards. All that Larry would have to do to make his contract would be to hold his spade losers to 1. As there were a lot of high cards outstanding, Larry really had no idea where the @SK and the @SJ had been dealt. He played the hand very nicely so that, when the time came, he was able to make a very educated guess in the spade suit. Watch...|

hs|wd|hs|sd|hs|ed|at|At this point I was very happy that I had not led a revealling high diamond. I chose to falsecard with the @DA (instead of the normal @DK) in an effort to further conceal my high cards from Larry.|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|On the actual diamond layout Larry probably knew that my @DA was a falsecard (otherwise Joey had played a small diamond from a holding headed by the @DKQJ). |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |

at|Another trump lead may have been better at this point, but I chose to exit with the @H4 (Joey and I use 3rd and 5th best leads throughout the hand). |

up|43|

nt|Well that was not the kind of first board that I had been hoping for! I turned to Larry and said "Welcome to Salt Lake City!" Being able to get over bad results quickly is important if you want to win at this game. I was fortunate that my partner Joey helps make this easy. Joey is a perfect partner and he would never say an unkind or critical word at the table. |
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


hs|eh|hs|es|hs|ed|nt|I have to admit, I felt like saying a few unkind words to my partner after this deal. I would not have doubled 3@C with his hand and I expected him to have more in the way of high card values to enter the auction at the 3-level, given that he knew that all of the suits were breaking badly. Joey probably didn't like my bidding either, but not a word was said.|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|es|ls|ed|

nt|I am good at keeping my mouth shut. We had a lot of boards ahead of us and getting annoyed at my partner on the first board of the event was not going to help us to score well in the rest of the tournament. Pushing the opponents into game, doubling them, and having them make was not the kind of board 1 that I was looking for, but hopefully things would improve soon...|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|es|ls|ed|sk|n|pn|Joey,Larry,Fred,David,South,West,North,East|md|2SAJHAJ98743DCKQT2,SK876HKT52DAQ87C6,SQ9432HQDK63CA943,ST5H6DJT9542CJ875|sv|n|mb|1D|an|Precision|mb|?|

hs|ns|nt|It did not take long for things to improve. 2 boards later I was dealt the above hand and Larry opened a Precision 1@D, suggesting either a balanced 11-13 or an unbalanced hand with diamonds. I had to decide whether to overcall 1@S or not. Only our side was vulnerable. The vulnerability is indicated by the graphic in the top left. Red is vulnerable. White is not vulnerable.|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


lb|*MDid Fred overcall?^Yes~No^2|mb|P|nt|I chose to pass, really without much choice playing with Joey. Our overcalls are always sound at unfavorable vulnerability and it would be a breach of partnership discipline to overcall 1@S with Joey as my partner. I actually don't think I would overcall on this hand regardless of who my partner was. If the @HQ was the @SJ it would be different.|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


mb|3D|an|Preemptive|

ls|ns|nt|David jumped to 3@D, a "preemptive raise" promising at least 5 diamonds. Given that David and Larry were playing a limited system, it was possible that David could have reasonable high card values for this call, but he certainly didn't promise any. |
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|?|
at|Joey overcalled 3@H and Larry surprised me by bidding 3@S. What do you make of that?|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^4h|hs|nh|mb|4h|nt|My first instinct was that I should double 3@S and plan to double the inevitable runout to 4@D. Then I remembered who I was playing with. My dear partner Joey would always have a sound hand for a 3-level overcall at unfavorable vulnerability. I therefore bid 4@H, expecting to make it. Also, it sounded like Larry and David both had shape - I did not expect to get rich against 4@D doubled.|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt|A persistent theme in the IOC Grand Prix was that "bidding one more" in high level competitive auctions was a winning strategy. You will see more of this in the weeks and deals to come. On this particular hand it really felt right to bid 4@H. I was wondering what Larry (Mr. Law of Total Tricks) would think when he saw the dummy...|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


mb|5D|

nt|David now bid 5@D and it looked like Larry might not get a chance to see my hand as dummy after all. I didn't want to defend 4@D doubled, but the prospect of defending 5@D doubled didn't feel so bad (especially since I did not know if we were making 4@H). At this point I was quite pleased with myself for having raised Joey to 4@H with my singleton @HQ.|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


ls|nh|mb|5H|mb|D|
nt|I became much less pleased with myself when Joey went on to 5@H and Larry made a confident double. I felt like we were about to get a second very bad result. |

pc|DA|
sk|s|at|Larry's opening lead was the @DA. You can know see the hand from Joey's point of view. Think about how you would play before reading on. |
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


hs|sh|nt|Before we go through the play, notice that Joey definitely had a sound overcall! His 3@H bid showed a good hand in our style, but he did not have to have anywhere near as much as he had. A lot of players (including me I suspect) would bid 4@H instead of 3@H on Joey's hand, but Joey has a certain style and it works well for him (especially when his partners know what to expect).  |

pg| ***** 79 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^2C|mb|2C|
hs|sh|hs|sd|nt|I chose to open with a strong 2@C. This is not exactly mainstream Canadian bidding where the concept of opening 2@C on a 2-suited hand is frowned upon. My friend and mentor ^*BEric Kokish^*N was the Chief Vugraph Commentator and I knew he would advocate a 1@H opening, heaping scorn on my choice of 2@C.|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


nt|There were 2 reasons why I chose to open 2@C on this hand. First, it passes the "balanced yarborough test" that ^*BJeff Rubens^*N refers to in ^*BThe Bridge World^*N magazine - if game is reasonable opposite a balanced hand with no high cards you should open 2@C. Second, I expected to be able to show both of my suits at a convenient level after Joey's expected 2@D response. |
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


mb|P|mb|3C|

hs|sc|ls|sh|ls|sd|nt|My plan went astray when, for the first time ever in our partnership, Joey did not respond 2@D to my 2@C. We play the 2@D response as "waiting" and we ^*Ialways^*N seem to wait. Not on ths deal though. I knew that Joey would bid 3@C here only if he had a strong suit that he wanted me to know about. That @CQ was looking like it might turn out to be a big card.|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


ls|sc|mb|P|mb|3H|mb|P|mb|4C|mb|P|mb|4D|

hs|sd|hs|sh|nt|I bid 3@H and, when Joey rebid 4@C (a very strong statement of a powerful suit), I bid 4@D. I was pleased that I had been able to bid both of my suits and find out about Joey's club suit in the process, but I was getting concerned that the rest of the auction might get complicated. Joey and I try to keep our auctions simple, but I suspected there would be no more simple bids on this one.|
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


ls|sh|ls|sd|

mb|P|mb|4S|
nt|Joey's next bid was 4@S and a lot of thoughts went through my head. Presumably 4@S was a cuebid, but in support of which suit? If he had bid either 4@H, 5@C, or 5@D instead then I could clearly pass, but what would a 4NT bid mean? Would it be Blackwood and, if so, is there a keycard suit? Would it be natural? Would it be a slam try in some suit without a spade control?|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


nt|I didn't know what 4NT would mean in this auction and I suspect that Joey didn't either. Even if Joey had a strong feeling about what 4NT "should" mean here, he would go out of his way not to make that call. Joey is a practical bridge player and knows that testing his partner on what an ambiguous bid "should" mean is not winning bridge.|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


mb|P|mb|?|
lb|*BWhat call did Fred make?^^5C|

hs|sc|mb|5C|
nt|5@D may seem like the most natural call here, but I thought that the time had come to show Joey my club support. If I thought that the auction could end here then I would have bid 6@C, but I knew that once Joey bid 4@S, there was no staying out of slam. I rejected 4NT for the same reason that Joey rejected 4NT at his last turn - because the call is ambiguous.|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


ls|sc|

mb|P|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|?|

nt|Joey's next call was 5@S which confirmed the @SA (his 4@S could have been based on the @SK or a singleton spade) and expressed interest in a grand slam. What do you think? Should I be cooperating with him and, if so, how?|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


lb|*bWhat call did Fred make?^^5N|


mb|5N|nt|I chose to bid 5NT to suggest that I was willing to cooperate in Joey's grand slam try, but that I was unwilling to bid seven myself. My hand was very minimum for a 2@C opening in our partnership, but I did have both red suit aces and enough top winners to take care of all of Joey's small cards. If my @CQ was enough to solidify his suit, I thought that Joey would know to put us in a grand slam.|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


mb|P|mb|7N|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|

nt|And that is exactly what happened. Joey leapt to 7NT and nobody doubled (always a good sign). |
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


pc|S3|

hs|ns|hs|nc|hs|sc|at|David led the @S3 and Joey had just about what I had been hoping for. It looked very much like 7NT was laydown. In fact, it was not laydown as the clubs were blocked and David's opening lead was attacking dummy's only side entry. Think about how you would play before reading on.|

ls|nc|ls|sh|ls|sd|up|11|nt|David and Larry had most of the decisions to make at our table during the rest of the match and they made them all well. They took all of their tricks (and a few of ours) on several difficult deals. Despite our 2 promising results, I knew that our teammates at the other table (Nick Gartaganis and Peter Jones) were going to have to play very well for us to win this match.

Each match in the IOC Grand Prix round robin is scored using the WBF's 30 point Victory Point scale. Canada beat the United states 34 IMPs to 5 IMPs in the first round and our 29 IMP win translated to 23 Victory Points for us and 7 for the United States.

It is always great to score as much as 23 Victory Points, but when you do it against one of the strongest bridge-playing countries in the world it is really something! Everyone congratulated Joey and I for making 5@H doubled and 7NT, but Nick and Peter had really done most of the hard work.

I believe that my "inexperienced" teammates learned a valuable lesson very early in this event - that they could beat anybody if they played well and received reasonable luck. Confidence is extremely important in this game. If you expect to lose then you are rarely disappointed. My team now knew that we were capable of beating the best, but there was an awfully long way to go....
