^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 308 - August 5, 2002^*N
^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
It is always nice to see your friends do well in a major event, especially when they were not among the pre-tournament favorites. In this year's Spingold (which was played at the recent ACBL Summer NABC in Washington DC), the unheralded ^*BMoss^*N team advanced all the way to the Finals before losing to the ^*BJacobs^*N Team.

Team Moss consisted of 2 of my close friends and former teammates, ^*BAllan Graves^*N and ^*BBryan Maksymetz^*N along with ^*BMike Moss^*N (who happens to be the father of my regular partner ^*BBrad Moss^*N) and ^*BMartin Shifko^*N, a brilliant young player from Austria. That's right - there were only 4 players on the Moss team (up to 6 players are allowed) which makes their accomplishment all the more remarkable.

I am also friendly with the players on the Jacobs Team (^*BGeorge Jacobs^*N-^*BRalph Katz^*N, ^*BLorenzo Lauria^*N-^*BAlfredo Versace^*N, and ^*BNorberto Bocchi^*B-^*BGiorgio Duboin^*N), but these guys have done so much winning during the last few years that it was very hard not to root for the underdog Moss team. Still, our congratulations go out to the Jacobs Team. Both Allan Graves and Bryan Maksymetz told me by e-mail that the Jacobs Team played great bridge (especially in the 4th quarter) and that they thoroughly deserved to win the 2002 Spingold.

This week's deal features Allan as declarer in a very ambitious slam from the first quarter of the Spingold Final.

nt|Allan Graves has been one of Canada's very best players for over 20 years and he has come close to winning several World Championships over the years. I have spent a lot of time talking bridge with Allan since shortly after I learned the game in the 1980s. His bridge wisdom is considerable and I have learned a great deal from my discussions with Allan and from my experiences playing on teams with him.

Besides being a great player, Allan is also an extraordinary bridge teacher. He is able to work with players of all levels of ability and his patient and friendly disposition ensure that his students are always in a good frame of mind for learning.

We are very fortunate that Allan has been doing a lot of online teaching through ^*BBridge Base Online^*N (both to individual students and to groups). While ^*BBridge Base Online^*N is an entirely free service, Allan makes his living from teaching bridge and it is necessary for him to receive payment when he teaches online. You can find out more about the services that Allan has to offer by sending him e-mail:

nt|This week's deal was rotated to make Allan South (since he eventually became the declarer). Allan and ^*BBryan Maksymetz^*N (who is universally known as ^*BMaks^*N) faced the great Italian pair of ^*BLorenzo Lauria^*N and ^*BAlfredo Versace^*N when this week's deal was played. Both sides were vulnerable and the form of scoring was IMPs. |

mb|P|mb|1S|mb|P|mb|?|
nt|Lorenzo, West, dealt and passed and Maks opened 1@S as North. Alfredo passed as East and Allan had his first decision to make. He and Maks were playing 5-card majors. A two over one response by Allan would be forcing to game. What call do you think Allan made as South?|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Allan make?^^2C|



hs|sc|mb|2C|an|Game force|
nt|Allan chose to force to game with 2@C. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|Why would Allan choose to bid his 4-card club suit |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


ls|sc|hs|sd|at|instead of his 5-card diamond suit? |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


hs|sc|at|The answer is all about suit quality - a concept that is largely ingnored in this age of highly structured bidding systems, but a concept that is still very dear to Allan's heart. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|Obviously Allan's 4 clubs were of much better quality than his 5 diamonds. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ls|sc|nt|Allan decided that he did not want to play in diamonds unless Maks could introduce that suit himself. His 2@C response gave Maks a convenient opportunity to show a 4-card diamond suit if he had one. Nowadays a lot of bridge players (even some experts) make bidding decisions by rote. It is refreshing to see a player like Allan who values his own judgment over system.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


ls|sd|hs|sc|nt|Nevertheless, Allan's 2@C was a slight overbid since it forced his partnership to game. Maks is not shy when it comes to opening the bidding and 12 HCP are not enough to necessarily make game a good prospect opposite an opening bid from Maks. |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


ls|sc|hs|sh|nt|At the same time, Allan was vulnerable at IMPs which is the perfect time to stretch a little for the game bonus. Also, his only alternative to forcing to game was to bid 1NT and Allan's heart holding strongly suggested that his partner should be the declarer in a notrump contract. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


ls|sh|hs|sc|at|All things considered, I really like Allan's decision to respond with a game forcing 2@C. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


ls|sc|mb|P|mb|2H|mb|P|mb|2N|
nt|Maks rebid 2@H and Allan tried 2NT (forcing since his 2@C had already forced the partnership to game). |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


hs|ss|mb|P|mb|3H|mb|P|mb|3S|
at|Maks' next call was 3@H, suggesting at least 5-5 in the majors, and Allan showed his partner that he had 2-card support for spades (he would have raised spades on the previous round if he had been dealt 3-card support). |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


ls|ss|mb|P|mb|6N|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|
nt|Maks, who had evidently been lurking in the bushes, then surprised Allan by jumping all the way to 6NT! Allan may have been surprised, but I am sure he did not show it at the table. In fact, one of Allan's greatest strengths as a bridge player is that he is able to control his emotions at the table. When you play against Allan you never know what he is thinking or feeling.|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


pc|D2|nt|Lorenzo led the @D2 (suggesting an odd number of diamonds) against 6NT and Maks laid down a beautiful hand in the dummy. It was unfortunately the case that, despite the beautiful dummy, 6NT was a horrible contract with very little play (especially after a diamond lead). Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sh|nt|Allan was in trouble. On a good day there would be 5 tricks in hearts |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|hs|nc|hs|sc|at|and, on a very good day, 4 club tricks would be available. |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|hc|da|hc|sa|at|The @SA and @DA would bring Allan up to 11 tricks, |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


lc|da|lc|sa|hs|ns|hs|ss|at|but a 12th trick seemed very far away. Allan could not afford to lose the lead in spades or the defense would be able to cash diamond tricks. Was a singleton @SK the only chance?|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|Allan demonstrated that some good luck in spades (but not a complete miracle) was required to bring his contract home. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |

pg| ***** 27 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sh|nt|Declarer had cleared the first hurdle, but there was still a lot of work to do. It was time to play on hearts and the percentage play in that suit is to lead out the top honors in the hope that the @HJ falls. |

ls|es|
pc|S9|hs|ss|at|and the moment of truth had come. Should Allan play the @SQ or the @S8 from his hand? |
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


at|Actually this was not really a guess given the quality of the defenders. If Alfredo had been dealt the @SK (instead of the @SJ), the defense would have arranged for Lorenzo to win Allan's diamond exit. |

nt|Allan therefore played the @S8 from his hand |
