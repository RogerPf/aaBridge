This week's deal contains a nice defense that was found by ^*BDavid Berkowitz^*N in the first qualifying session of the Life Master Open Pairs in Birmingham. David's partner, ^*BLarry Cohen^*N, reported this deal in the Daily Bulletin. The deal has been rotated to make South the declarer.

Larry and David have arguably been the world's most successful matchpoint pair in recent years. Larry, a very popular bridge author, has been working with ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N to develop a series of educational software products intended for intermediate to advanced players. 

This series is entitled ^*BPlay Bridge with Larry Cohen^*N and currently contains 2 titles based on the first 2 days of the 1999 Life Master Pairs. A third title in this series should be on sale by February 2001. Additional information about all ^*BBridge Base^*N software products is available through this web site. If you appreciate free online bridge content like ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N and ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N you can support these efforts by purchasing our educational software!

nt||lb|*MWhat call did Larry make?^2 Diamonds~Pass^2|mb|P|nt|Larry chose to pass which will come as no surprise if you have read any of Larry's writing on ^*BThe Law of Total Tricks^*N (which suggests that one should make a 2-level overcall on a 5-card suit only if there is no reasonable alternative).|

ls|wd|hs|sh|nt|North responded 1NT and South aggressively rebid 4@H which became the final contract. Since most of the field rebid only 2@H as South (we agree), it was extremely important for Larry and David to find a way to defeat 4@H.
