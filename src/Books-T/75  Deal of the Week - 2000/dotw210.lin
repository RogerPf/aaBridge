bt||nt||cs|1|at|
^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 210 - September 18, 2000^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played by Germany's ^*BSabine Auken^*N, considered by many to be the strongest woman bridge player in the world. Sabine now lives in Denmark with her husband Jens (a top Danish player and WBF Vice President) and their family. She still plays bridge for her native Germany, however, and her partnership with ^*BDaniela Von Arnim^*N has helped make that nation a power in Women's bridge. 

Sabine and Daniela are both fierce competitors, but win or lose they display nothing but class at the table. It is always a pleasure to play against them. The men out there are fortunate in that they sometimes get the chance to play against Sabine and Daniela. This pair is among the few top woman partnerships that frequently play in open events (where they more than hold their own).

Germany was one of the favored teams in the recent ^*BWorld Women's Team Olympiad^*N in ^*BMaastricht, The Netherlands^*N, but they were upset in the semi-finals by Canada 177-133 IMPs over 96 boards. This week's deal took place in the second (of 6) 16-board segments of this match. The deal has been rotated to make South (Sabine) the declarer.

nt|Sabine rebid 1NT to show a balanced 17-18 HCP hand. Daniela invoked what looks to be some kind of invitational Puppet Staymanish sequence and Sabine went on to 3NT, which became the final contract.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


hs|wc|nt|Looking at all 4 hands it is easy to say, "I would never lead a club as West - I would lead one of the red suits that partner surely has for her double." At the table (to say nothing of being on vugraph) it is much harder to lead anything except a club. It turns out that the contract would have had no chance on any other lead.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |

ls|sh|ls|nh|ls|eh|hs|sc|hs|nc|hs|wc|at|Sabine would be able to develop an 8th trick in clubs by driving out West's @CK, but there was no obvious source of a 9th trick.|

hs|sh|hs|ed|nt|Thanks to Sabine stripping East of her spades, East was now endplayed. If she chose to cash the @DA for the defenders' 4th trick, Sabine would discard a heart loser. |

ls|eh|ls|nh|ls|sh|pc|hk|hs|nh|at|the result would be the same. In either case dummy's @HQ would win Sabine's 9th trick and she would make her contract.|mc|9|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |

nt|Sabine played this hand very nicely, but the defense could have prevailed on the actual layout. West's club opening lead and diamond shift were reasonable, but perhaps West should have switched to a heart after winning the 3rd round of clubs. Sabine would then be left without recourse. |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


hs|eh|md|0,h9,,ht|nt|Note, however, that if East had been dealt the @H10 to go with his @HKJ10 the defense is finished  once East discards ^*Bany^*N of her hearts. |

nt|It seemed natural for West to continue diamonds after winning the third round of clubs, |

pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|Sabine should be commended for putting West in the difficult position of having to choose between a diamond |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


ls|wd|hs|wh|md|0ha6,,,hkj|at|and a heart return at the critical point of this deal. |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


up|1|ls|sh|ls|wh|at|The main thing West had to go on was her partner's encouraging heart discard on the third round of clubs.|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|Here is a tough question to discuss with your regular partner: Does an encouraging heart discard mean "I want you to play a heart" (necessary on the above layout) |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


md|0hkj,,,ha6|at|or does it mean "I have the @HA" (in which case a diamond continuation is necessary)?|

hs|nd|hs|sd|hs|ed|nt|Not to take anything away from Sabine's fine effort, but our friend ^*BSteve Bloom^*N pointed out an improvement in her line of play that would have left the defense with no chance. Suppose that instead of leading a third round of clubs, Sabine had ducked a diamond to East. We didn't spot this play with all the cards in view (and with unlimited time) so Sabine can be forgiven for missing this play at the table!|

hs|wc|hs|sc|at|who, down to just clubs, would have to give Sabine access to her 9th trick in that suit.|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


ls|sc|ls|wc|up|44|hs|ws|nt|At the other table ^*BPony Nehmert^*N, West for Germany, did very well to lead a spade against 3NT (South at that table had opened a natural 1@C). 3NT had no chance on a spade lead and the contract eventually failed by 2 tricks, +200 for Germany. |
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


ls|ws|pc|cq|at|That +200, along with Sabine's fine +600 for making 3NT on a club lead, resulted in a 13 IMP swing to Germany on this board. |
