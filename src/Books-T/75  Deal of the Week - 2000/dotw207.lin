^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 207 - August 28, 2000^*N }
^-
^*BSidney Lazard^*N is one of the bridge players that we admire most in the world. Sidney has been a world class bridge player for close to 50 years. Sidney is now in his seventies, but his partnership with ^*BBart Bramley^*N is among the strongest in North America. We are delighted to report that Sidney was inducted into the ^*BBridge Hall of Fame^*N during the recent ACBL North American Championships in Anaheim.

Sidney has remarkable judgement in the bidding and great table presence. Sidney has seen it all as far as card play goes. He is technically very strong, but he is also one known as one the most creative declarers and defenders in the game. Sidney as about as natural a bridge player as you could ever hope to meet. He is an absolute class act at the table and a pleasure to play against.

Sidney played this week's deal in a high stakes rubber bridge game almost 50 years ago. This deal was reported in the ACBL Daily Bulletin in Anaheim by Bart Bramley. Bart is not only Sidney's current partner, but he is also one of Sidney's greatest fans. Bart was given the honor of introducing Sidney at the Hall of Fame induction ceremonies.

This must be one of the greatest deals of all time. Get ready for a treat!

The World Bridge Championships are currently taking place in ^*BMaastricht, The Netherlands^*N. Full coverage of this event, including ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N is available through:

nt|Sidney had been dealt the powerful South hand was surprised to hear East open 1@C in front of him. East was Bill Hanna, a notorious psycher, and Sidney immediately suspected that something was fishy. He still had a serious bidding problem. What call do you think Sidney made as South?|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Sidney make?^^P|mb|p|nt|Sidney chose to Pass, eminently sensible in our view (even though we are not big fans of trap passing). The only reasonable alternative in our view is 1@D, but if we had Sidney's table presence we would Pass for sure and expect to know what to do later in the bidding!|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |

nt|West responded 1@S and Sidney's partner, ^*BMarshall Miles^*N (another all time great), passed. East also passed, confirming that he had psyched. Sidney was faced with another bidding problem. What call do you think he made? |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Sidney make?^^2N|
mb|2n|nt|Sidney tried 2NT, a practical call that suggested a strong club trap that did not need much help to make 3NT. The scientists out there might argue for 3@C or 2@S, but bidding against a psych is not a science (nor is much of bidding for that matter).|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


mb|3H|mb|P|mb|4H|
nt|Sidney was surprised to see West come back into the auction with 3@H - clearly showing a very strong and distributional hand given that East had revealled that he had psyched. Marshall passed and East, after some thought, raised to 4@H. Sidney now made a remarkable bid, but in order for you to have a chance to figure it out there are a couple of things you should know. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|1. East's psyching habits were well known and he preferred to psych in his longest suit.

2. Sidney's table presence told him that East's hesitation was not about whether to raise hearts versus passing, but whether he should either raise hearts or go back to spades.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


lb|*BWhat call did Sidney make?^^6D|
mb|6D|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|hs|sd|nt|Sidney bid 6@D(!), expecting to make this contract. Sidney had inferred that East had been dealt length in spades, hearts, and clubs (and therefore very few diamonds). West, meanwhile, appeared to have at least 6-5 in the majors. There were not many diamonds left for him to hold either. Sidney suspected that his partner had been dealt at least 6 diamonds and he thought he was a favorite to come to 12 tricks.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


hs|nd|sk||nt|Sidney inferences were completely accurate as you can see by looking at the entire deal. Marshall had just about what Sidney had expected, but it would still take some serious wizardly in the play for Sidney to bring home his slam. |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |

nt|What you just saw was essentially a ^*Bnon-simultaneous double squeeze^*N, but the key roles played by dummy's last trump makes the end position that Sidney reached very unusual.
