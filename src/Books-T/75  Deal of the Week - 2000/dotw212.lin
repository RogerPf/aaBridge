^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 212 - October 2, 2000^*N }
^-
This week's deal took place during the fourth segment of the Quarter Finals of the recent ^*BWorld Open Teams Olympiad^*N in ^*BMaastricht, The Netherlands^*N. Full coverage of this event, including plenty of ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N, is available through:

This web site has been significantly expanded since the World Championships ended in early September. For example, there is now ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N for all 4 segments of all 8 Quarter Final matches (as well as some segments of some of the matches from the Women's Olympiad Quarter Finals). The boards were duplicated in all of these matches and it is fascinating to compare the bids and plays made by several of the best players in the world.

This week's deal is a good example. This deal was played 16 times in the Open Olympiad Quarter Finals. At 15 tables South opened 1NT. At 13 of these tables South declared either 1NT, 2NT, or 3NT. The number of tricks won by these Souths ranged from 4 to 8. When you see the deal itself you will probably think that it looks like a normal enough deal and that it is strange that such a deal played by world class players would produce so much variation.

We will follow the action in the Closed Room of the match between Poland and France (Poland won this match but eventually lost in the Finals to Italy).  ^*BMichal Kwiecien^*N, the declarer for Poland, was arguably the most successful of all the Souths that played in notrump on this deal. Kwiecien was playing with ^*BJacek Pszczola^*N against ^*BHerve Mouiel^*N  and ^*BMaurice Salama^*N of France when this week's deal was played.

at|At the one table where South did not open 1NT, Australia's ^*BStephen Burgess^*N opened 1@D on the North hand! We are not sure if this was a recording error, a psych, or the actual systemic bid for Burgess and his partner ^*BPaul Marston^*N (who do play a very unusual bidding system). Burgess and Marston finished in 3@D which failed by 3 tricks. |
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


mb|P|mb|1N|nt|All 15 of the other Norths and Easts passed and all 15 of the other Souths opened 1NT. At how many of these tables do you think West overcalled? Only East-West were vulnerable (you can see this with the diagram in the upper left corner - red means vulnerable, white means not vulnerable).|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


mb|P|nt|Australia's ^*BMatt Mallumphy^*N was the only West to overcall (he bid 2@S which was passed out and failed by 1 trick). The other 14 Wests chose to Pass. Do not infer from what you have read so far that Australians are crazy bidders. There were likely state-of-the-match considerations in both Burgess's and Mallumphy's choice of actions (Australia was losing heavily to Italy and time was running out).|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|Over to North. How many of the 14 Norths in this position do you think passed 1NT, how many invited game, and how many forced to game? |

nt|4 Norths passed 1NT (some of these, such as Americans ^*BBerkowitz-Cohen^*N were using a 14-16 1NT opening) and 9 Norths invited game via Stayman. Argentina's ^*BAlejandro Bianchedi^*N was the only North to force to game, raising directly to 3NT (again there may have been state-of-the-match considerations).|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|At the 4 tables where North chose to Pass 1NT, Indonesia's ^*BDenny Sacul^*N was the only East to balance. Sacul bid 2@H which became the final contract. This contract was not exactly a thing of beauty, but the lie of the East-West cards was very friendly and Sacul emerged with 8 tricks. Note that at both tables where East-West bid over 1NT neither North took any action.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


mb|P|
hs|sc|nt|At the 9 tables where North invited with 2NT, how many Souths do you think went on the 3NT? South's hand is a minimum 15-17 HCP 1NT, but experts frequently upgrade notrump hands that contain a strong 5-card suit.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


mb|P|mb|P|ls|sc|nt|This was a close one. 5 Souths chose to bid 3NT while 4 Souths chose to Pass. Kwiecien for Poland was one of the passers and 2NT became the final contract. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


hs|ws|at|Over to West. It is clear to lead a spade from the West hand, but should West lead a high spade or a low spade? Do you think that the level of the final contract should matter?|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ls|ws|pc|SQ|
nt|We found it strange that 12 of the 13 Wests on lead against notrump chose a high spade instead of a low one! England's ^*BGunnar Hallberg^*N was the only West to lead a small spade (he was defending against 3NT). At our featured table Mouiel, like almost all of the other Wests, chose to lead a spade honor (presumably the @SQ is the conventional lead from this holding for Mouiel-Salama).|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt|A low spade lead was definitely better than a high spade lead on this particular deal. Hallberg and partner ^*BColin Simpson^*N held Belgium's ^*BZvi Engel^*N to 5 tricks after this start! The +250 that Hallberg and Simpson won for 3NT down 5 was the best score achieved by the 16 East-West pairs on this deal.|

at|Salama's heart return was necessary to defeat the contract, but Mouiel had to cooperate by discarding the @C5 on this trick. Watch how Kwiecien made Mouiel pay for his decision to discard a spade.|

hs|nd|nt|When Kwiecien led a diamonds towards the dummy at trick 4, he would have ensured the contract on the actual layout by playing the @DK (instead of the @D9).

hs|ns|hs|ws|nt|Playing dummy's @DK (instead of the @D9) may be considered double dummy, but here is a possible realistic improvements to Kwiecien's line. The play is now at the point where Kwiecien cashed the @S10 before leading the @S8 to start a series of endplays against Mouiel. |

hs|ec|ls|ns|ls|ws|hs|nc|hs|wc|hs|sc|nt|By this time, Kwiecien must have strongly suspected that Mouiel had begun with a 5224 hand, most likely with the the @CK. If this was the case then Kwiecien could succeed by leading a club from the dummy, just covering Salama's card. |
