nt|East's weak 2@S opening is passed around to North who doubles for takeout. Only North-South are vulnerable (you can tell this by the graphic in the upper left corner of the above display - red indicates vulnerable and white indicates not vulnerable).  Think about what call you would make as South.|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


nt||lb|*BWhat call would you make?^^3N|mb|3N|
nt|We think 3NT is the correct call with the vulnerability being the main factor in making 3NT more attractive than Pass. South will often make 3NT even if North has reopened on a light hand with only 10 or 11 HCP (because East's 2@S will often make it possible for South to play as if he can see all of the cards).|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|Meanwhile, it would not be at all surprising for East to be able to win 4 spade tricks and at least 1 side suit trick. 2@S is certainly likely to fail, but the penalty is unlikely to provide adequate compensation for North-South's probable vulnerable game. We are strong believer's in ^*BEdgar Kaplan's^*N immortal truism: "Takeout doubles are for takeout!"|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


hs|sd|nt|3@D should not be seen as a compromise between Pass and 3NT. 3@D is likely to end the auction as North would never play South for this good a hand. South would thus be deprived on both the vulnerable game bonus and the possibility of a penalty against 2@S doubled.|

nt|North raises to 6NT which becomes the final contract. |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


pc|SJ|
at|West's opening lead is the @SJ and the sight of dummy suggests that 2@S doubled would have produced a penalty of at least 800 points for North-South. Making 6NT, however, will be even better. Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on.|
