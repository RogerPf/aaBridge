^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week #194 - May 29, 2000^*N }
^-
|cs|1|at|^-{ ^*BSPECIAL!!! There are 2 Deals of the Week this week!!!^*N }
^-
Both are based on deals that took place during the recent ^*BCavendish Invitational^*N in Las Vegas. Full coverage of the Cavendish is available through:

|cs|2|at|^-{ ^*Bwww.thecavendish.com^*N }
^-
Both of this week's deals are presented as declarer play problems. They are both somewhat easier than most of the problems that appear on ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N so we thought it was only fair to give you 2 deals this week. These problems may not seem too difficult, but several world class players misplayed these deals when they took place in the Cavendish.

For both of these problems assume IMP scoring (that is, just try to make your contract - don't worry about overtricks). Your opponents are excellent players so don't expect much help from the defense.

Click the  ^$40  button on the toolbar below to see the first deal.

The second deal is presented at the end of the first deal.

nt|You, South, open 1@D, West overcalls 1@H and your partner raises you to 2@D. East surprises you by bidding 2@S and it is up to you to call. You have choices.|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


nt||lb|*MWhat is the correct call?^Pass~Double~2 Notrump~3 Clubs~3 Diamonds~Good question^6|nt|This is a very difficult bidding problem. Your hand has plenty of holes and questionable values, but you do have 17 HCP and you could belong in game. Passing is too timid and the weak spade spots make a penalty double most unattractive. A competitive 3@D is reasonable if there is no game your way, but if you decide you want to try for game you have to choose between 2NT and 3@C.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


hs|sc|hs|sd|nt|It would be normal in this auction to try for game with 3@C. Telling partner about your side suits is generally a good idea, especially in an auction where partner could easily have longer clubs than diamonds. The problem with 3@C is that partner will usually expect more than 8 cards in the minors. He will also not expect the majority of your high card strength to be in the majors.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


ls|sc|ls|sd|mb|2n|nt|The advantage to 2NT is that this call let's partner know you have high cards in the majors, extra values, and not much in the way of distribution. It would be nice if we had a true heart stopper, but the defenders don't know that we don't. 2NT gives your @HK some value which is one of the things this call has going for it. What is the downside of 2NT? We will see in a moment.|

nt|Partner raises to 3NT which becomes the final contract. |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


pc|HJ|at|The opening lead is the @HJ.

The dummy is a good example of why 2NT was a poor bid. West appears to have led from the @HA, partner put down a nice dummy, and the contract still looks to be hopeless!|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|5@C is an excellent contract, requiring little more than finding the @CJ. If you bid 3@C instead of 2NT you would have reached 5@C (partner would have splintered with 4@S over 3@C). In any case you are in 3NT and you have to try to make 9 tricks. Don't blame this on partner. He made a good bid with 2@D and even if he had 5 diamonds to the @DKQ the contract still would be awful.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||pc|H3|pc|H6|pc|HK|
nt|East follows small and your @HK wins the first trick. You may be a bad bidder, but you are a great card player. Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sc|nt|At first glance the contract appear to have no chance. You need to knock out the @CA to have any hope of winning 9 tricks and when you do so the defenders are sure to cash enough heart tricks to defeat 3NT. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|nh|nt|The key to this deal is to realize that the defenders may not be able to cash many heart tricks at all. If West was dealt @HAJ10xxx and East @HQx then dummy's remaining @H9xx will prevent the defenders from running the heart suit.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


ls|nh|hs|sc|ls|nc|nt|Assuming hearts are 6-2 (otherwise there is no chance), it is possible to guarantee the contract without having to guess the @CJ. The simplest way to do so is to start by leading the @CQ from your hand. It doesn't matter who wins the @CA or if the @CQ is allowed to hold.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |

pc|H8|pc|H4|pc|HQ|pc|S3|nt|West leads a small heart to East's @HQ as you discard a spade. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


pc|SQ|
hs|ss|at|East, who indeed appears to be out of hearts, switches to the @SQ which you gratefully win in hand. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


ls|ss|pc|SA|pc|S7|pc|S6|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sc|at|You are now in a position to guarantee the contract by finessing West for the @CJ. If the finesse wins then you will make your contract with 2 overtricks, but even if East wins the @CJ he cannot hurt you as he has no more hearts.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt|Overtricks are not ^*Ivery^*N important at IMPs, but they do count for something. Now that the contract is safe can you give yourself any extra chances of getting the clubs right? |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|ls|nc|ls|sc|at|It cannot hurt to play 4 rounds of diamonds first. Perhaps you will learn something useful. |

at|Both defenders follow to 3 rounds of diamonds. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


pc|d|pc|h|pc|h|pc|s|at|West discards a heart on the 4th round of diamonds and East pitches a spade.|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|You know know that West was dealt 6 hearts and 3 diamonds and he has already followed suit once in both clubs and spades. East must have been dealt either 6 or 7 spades for his 2@S call (since he apparently has very little in the way of high card strength). If East has 6 spades then West was dealt 2632 distribution, but if East has 7 spades then West has 1633 distribution.|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


hs|ss|nt|If you are really feeling confident that East has at least 6 spades then you should cash the @SK to learn West's exact distribution and guarantee 2 overtricks. If you are happy just to be making 3NT take a club finesse (you probably would have done so earlier).|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt||ls|ss|pc|sk|pc|h|pc|h|pc|s|nt|If you have the guts to cash the @SK then you will see West discard a heart. |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sc|at|West is now known to have started with exactly 1633 distribution and you can be sure that the club finesse will win. If West had followed to the second round of spades he would be counted out for 2632 and you could play a club to the @CK with 100% confidence (well, maybe 99%).|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |

nt|The club finesse wins, as expected, and you can now claim the rest of the tricks. |mc|11|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


up|39|sk||
hs|ec|hs|wc|nt|Here is the distribution that was actually dealt. Notice that the good contract of 5@C could well fail as West could easily come to 2 trump tricks (as well as the @HA). You don't have the luxury of exploring the distribution of the other 3 suits when clubs are trump! Meanwhile, you would make the horrible contract of 3NT with 2 overtricks if you played it properly. Bridge can be very unfair!|

Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on.|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


hs|sh|nt|At first glance the contract looks very secure as there appear to be only 3 losers at the most (the diamond trick already lost, the @HQ, and the @CK). Perhaps you should simply play trumps from the top in order to prevent the defenders from winning any tricks with ruffs.|

pc|hk|pc|h|pc|h|pc|c|nt|The danger of this line is that one of the defenders may have been dealt 4 hearts including the @HQ. When East discards on the second round of hearts the contract could be in trouble. |

hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|The contract is still a big favorite to succeed. The best play is to cash dummy's top spades in the hope that the @SQ drops. |

sk||mc|8|hs|wd|nt|West wins the @CK and is now able to cash 2 diamond tricks to defeat the contract by 2 tricks.

It was very unlucky to go down after playing this way, but there was a better line of play available that would guard against this unlucky layout. Can you see how you should have played?|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


up|32|ls|wd|
hs|sh|hs|nh|hs|wh|nt|We are back at trick 2 where we made the mistake of cashing the top hearts. The key to this deal is to maintain trump control against a 4-1 break and there is a safety play available that will virtually guarantee the contract. The correct play is to play a low heart from your hand, surrendering an early trick to the @HQ.|
