bt||nt||cs|2|at|
^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 211 - September 25, 2000^*N }
^-
This week's deal is an original creation of ^*BRichard Pavlicek^*N. Richard is a brilliant bridge player who has won 10 North American Championships over the past 3 decades. He is also a gifted analyst who delights in constructing bridge problems for players of various levels of ability.

Richard rates the problem presented in this week's deal as "easy", but we think that means "easy for Richard". After you have gone through this problem you will probably wonder what a "hard" Pavlicek creation looks like! Whatever you think of the level of this problem, we are certain you will think that it is elegant. Thanks to Richard for letting us be the first to publish this beautiful deal.

Richard has many other talents besides his bridge skills. He is one of the best and most successful bridge teachers in North America, an accomplished programmer of bridge software, and the creator of one of the first and best bridge web sites. The address of Richard's site recently changed to:

|cs|1|at|^-{ ^*Bwww.rpbridge.net^*N }
^-
This site contains a ton of Richard's articles, puzzles, and quizzes for players of all levels of ability, as well as plenty of bridge humor, and some excellent web-based bridge utilities. ^*Brpbridge.net^*N also contains information about the ^*BBridge Tutor^*N software that Richard developed,  ^*BThe Pavlicek School of Bridge^*N, and various clubs in Florida that are associated with this school. This web site is a "must visit" for all bridge players!
