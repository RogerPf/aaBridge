^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week #196 - June 12, 2000^*N }

|cs|1|at|{ ^*BSpecial!!! There are 2 Deals of the Week this week!^*N }
^-
Both deals took place during the recent ^*BUSA International Team Trials^*N in Memphis, Tennessee. Full coverage of this event, including ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N, is available through:

|cs|4|at|^-{ ^*Bwww.acbl.org^*N }
^-
These deals were played in the semi-final match between Nickell (Nickell-Freeman, Meckstroth-Rodwell, Hamman-Soloway) and Jacobs (Jacobs-Katz, Garner-Weinstein, Berkowitz-Cohen). Jacobs defeated the top-seeded Nickell team by just 7 IMPs over this 160 board match to advance to the finals.

Both of this week's deals feature good defense, first by Howard Weinstein and Steve Garner, and second by Jeff Meckstroth and Eric Rodwell. The first deal will begin on the next page. The second deal is presented at the end of the first deal. Both deals have been rotated to make South the declarer.

hs|ws|hs|wh|hs|wd|hs|wc|nt|Freeman, South for the Nickell team, declared 1NT after Weinstein, West had overcalled 1@S. Think about what card you would lead as West after the above auction.|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


nt||lb|*CWhat did Weinstein lead?^^s7^saj976hqj4c6dajt3|ls|ws|ls|wh|ls|wd|ls|wc|pc|s7|
nt|Weinstein made the very normal lead of the @S7. If there is a single bridge maxim that can be said to have withstood the test of time, it would have to be "fourth from your longest and strongest". There is a good reason for that - these leads tend to work out well in the long run. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


sk||at|On this particular deal just about any lead would have been effective.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|es|hs|ss|nt|The @S7 was covered by dummy's @S8 and Garner's @S10 and won by Freeman with the @SQ. |

pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|It turns out that if Garner had won the @CQ, the defense could have then won the next 8 tricks. Garner was more worried about winning 7 total tricks on defense. As you will see, the defense still came to 9 tricks despite Garner's club duck.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


hs|sc|hs|wd|nt|Freeman continued with the @CA and Weinstein's diamond discard revealed that the club suit was not coming in. |

pg| ***** 22 ***** |


hs|eh|hs|wh|ls|ed|at|He actually returned a heart to his partner's @HJ which made the rest of the play more interesting. |

hs|ss|hs|sd|at|Freeman was squeezed on this trick. He knew that a spade discard would be fatal for sure, so he pitched a small diamond and hoped for the best. |

nt|Weinstein and Garner scored +300 for defeating 1NT by 3 tricks. At the other table the East-West pair for the Nickell Team declared 2@D and made an overtrick for +110. The Jacobs team won 5 IMPs on this deal thanks to the strong result by Weinstein and Garner.|

mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|1S|
hs|eh|hs|ss|nt|Here is this week's second deal. Notice Meckstroth's vulnerable 1@H overcall despite holding a weak suit and minimum high card values. Notice Garner's free bid of 1@S despite holding an even weaker suit and almost no high card values! Both of these guys know that it is shape and fit, not high cards, that count in competitive bidding.|

mb|2N|an|4-card limit raise|mb|D|
nt|Rodwell's 2NT was an articificial limit raise with 4-card support for hearts. After Weinstein doubled to suggest extra strength (someone at the table had to have it) Meckstroth made an interesting call as East.|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt||lb|*BWhat did Meckstroth bid?^^4c|

mb|4C|hs|ec|nt|Meckstroth bid 4@C! By partnership agreement this bid showed a 2-suited hand that was willing to play 4@H, but was unsure as to what to do if the opponents should bid 4@S. Meckstroth wanted to bring Rodwell into the picture should the opponents bid 4@S. By revealing his approximate distribution, Meckstroth was hoping to put Rodwell in a good position to make an accurate 5-level decision for the partnership.|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


ls|ec|hs|wh|hs|ns|mb|P|mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|After Garner passed, Rodwell corrected to 4@H and Weinstein bid 4@S. |

mb|P|mb|P|mb|D|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|
hs|wh|hs|ws|at|This was passed around to Rodwell who doubled on the strength of his spade holding and @HA. 4@S doubled was the final contract. |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


hs|wd|hs|wc|at| Pretend you can't see all 52 cards and think about what card you would lead as West.|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt||lb|*CWhat did Rodwell lead?^^ha^skq9haj62c843d954|
ls|ws|ls|wh|ls|wd|ls|wc|pc|ha|nt|Rodwell chose to lead the @HA, which did not work out very well on this deal. A club opening lead would have defeated the contract at least one trick without the defense breathing hard. After Rodwell's @HA, it took some serious breathing to defeat the contract!|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |

pg| ***** 63 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|at|Garner could have actually made an overtrick now by playing a diamond to the @DA, but he expected Rodwell to hold the @DK and innocently repeated the finesse. |

ls|ws|ls|sd|up|44|nt|Meckstroth-Rodwell were +200 on this deal. Their teammates at the other table defended 3@H and defeated this contract 1 trick  for +100 (also on a nice defense). The Nickell Team thus won 7 IMPs on this deal. |
