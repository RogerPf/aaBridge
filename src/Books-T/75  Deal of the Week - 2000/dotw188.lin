^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week #188 - April 17, 2000^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played by Norway's ^*BGeir Helgemo^*N during the recent ^*BGenerali World Masters Individual^*N in Athens, Greece. Full coverage of the Generali, including ^*BOnline Vugraph^*N, is available through:

Bridge Base Inc. President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N was fortunate to be one of the 52 players invited to this year's Generali. In this tournament each player has a chance to play 2 boards with each of the other players as his partner! Everyone plays the same relatively simple bidding system. Fred had the unusual distinction of finishing with a score of 50.00%, dead average, after 4 sessions of play!  Even though Fred finished this event exactly where he started it, he found the 2000 Generali Individual to be one of the most enjoyable events of his bridge career. Thanks to the World Bridge Federation and the local organizers for running such a magnificent tournament!

Geir Helgemo, a past winner of the Generali Individual, does not need much of an introduction as he is widely recognized as one of the very best players in the world. Geir is always a complete gentleman at the table and, as Fred found out in their 2 boards as partners, he is also a pleasure to play with. In this week's deal Geir demonstrates 2 of the reasons he wins so often - he is fearless in the bidding and he plays his cards like a magician. The defense was far from perfect in this week's deal, but Geir's opponents were both former World Champions. The deal has been rotated to make South the declarer.

at|We really like East's redouble despite the fact that this call would normally indicate at least 10 high card points. The message that redouble carries is that you have a strong hand for defense and that you can control the auction. This East hand certainly qualifies even though it contains "only" 9 high card points.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


mb|1h|hs|sh|nt|Geir's 1@H, despite having only 3 cards in that suit, was also a clever choice. We expect that Geir would have run from 1@H (perhaps to 1NT) if he was doubled. It is often difficult to double the opponents at the 1-level, however, and Geir suspected that a heart lead would probably be best if East or West wound up declaring the hand.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


ls|sh|mb|P|mb|P|mb|1N|nt|Geir's 1@H was passed around to East who chose to bid 1NT (instead of doubling). We suspect that the vulnerability, the matchpoint scoring, and Geir's reputation as a great declarer all contributed to East's decision. As you will see shortly, East was correct that he could not defeat Geir in 1@H.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


mb|2C|
hs|sc|nt|Just about every bridge player in the world would be delighted to have escaped a penalty as South, but Geir Helgemo is something special. He was not willing to sell out to 1NT and introduced his other 3-card suit with 2@C!!! It was very likely that Geir's partner was dealt 4 cards in either hearts or clubs, but his 2@C call was ^*Bextremely^*N brave nonetheless.|

pg| ***** 8 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sh|nt|Geir had managed to get himself into a 3-3 fit, and not a very strong one at that. The one thing he had going for him (besides his skill, of course) was that the opponents had no idea that Geir had been dealt only 3 cards in each of the suits he had bid. We are not sure if this is any excuse for the defense that took place, but we think you will find the result to be amusing.|

hs|wd|hs|nd|at|West, who couldn't possibly read the diamond position based on the bidding, made the natural play of the @DJ and Geir won the trick with dummy's @DK. |

hs|es|nt|Perhaps afraid to break the club suit from his @C109 or to relinquish trump control, East decided to return a spade! |

hs|sc|hs|nc|hs|wc|nt|Geir won his 7th trick (we told you East shouldn't have doubled 1@H!) with a low club to West's @CK and dummy's @CA.|

at| Geir was not satisfied with 7 tricks, however. He saw a slight chance to come to an 8th trick. Can you see how Geir won another trick in the above hopeless looking  position? ^*BHINT:^*N He had a little more help from the defense.|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


hs|nh|nt|Geir exited with the dummy's last trump! |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


ls|nh|pc|H4|
hs|eh|at|East, who's head must have been spinning by this point, now knew that Geir had bid 2@C on a 3-card suit. He "knew" that Geir had to have the outstanding @H10 - not even Helgemo would have the nerve to freely bid 2 3-card suits against opponents of this caliber! East therefore went up with the @HA in an attempt to hold Geir to his contract.|

at|Geir Helgemo has the ability to make bridge players smile, even when he is taking their matchpoints away (which is most of the time). You cannot help but like and admire this guy.|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


hs|ec|hs|sc|nt|East was entitled to another trump trick, but he then had to give Geir his 8th trick (and his doubled contract) at the end with the @CQ.
