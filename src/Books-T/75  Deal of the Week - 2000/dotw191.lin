^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week #191 - May 8, 2000^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played by ^*BVicent Ramondt^*N of The Netherlands during the recent ^*BPolitiken World Pairs^*N in Copenhagen, Denmark. Ramondt and partner, ^*BAnton Maas^*N, finished a strong 5th of the 16 pairs who were invited to play in the 2000 Politiken. Ramondt and Mass faced the eventual winners, Italians ^*BNorberto Bocchi^*N and ^*BGiorgio Dubion^*N, when this week's deal was played. The deal has been rotated to make South the declarer. We would like to thank ^*BEric Kokish^*N for telling us about this week's deal.

Before we get started, here is the answer to the problem that was posed last week:

You are declarer in 5@C and have no losers outside the trump suit. Your trumps are:

|cs|3|at|^-{ @C^*B AQ108765^*N }
^-
Unfortunately the dummy is void in trump. After winning the opening lead you lay down the @CA and both defenders follow small. How do you continue?

|cs|3|at|^-{ @C^*B AQ108765^*N }

This was actually a trick question. There is no right answer. It is a complete 3-way guess as to whether you should continue with the @CQ, @C10, or a small club.

Your play will not matter if clubs are either 3-3 or 5-1, or if one of the defenders was dealt @CKJ9x. All that matters are the distributions in which one of the defenders was dealt either @CKx, @CJx, or @C9x. Each of these three layouts is equally likely. Each of the 3 possible plays will pick up clubs in 2 of the 3 layouts.

|cs|1|at|^-{ Playing the @CQ will succeed when a defender was dealt @CJx or @C9x, 
 but will fail when a defender was dealt @CKx. }

|cs|4|at|{ Playing the @C10 will succeed when a defender was dealt @CKx or @C9x, 
 but will fail when a defender was dealt @CJx. }

|cs|2|at|{ Playing a small club will succeed when a defender was dealt @CKx or @CJx, 
 but will fail when a defender was dealt @C9x. }
^-
Sorry if you feel ripped off by this trick question. We found this problem interesting because we think that a pure 3-way guess is a very rare thing in the game of bridge.

hs|eh|hs|es|nt|Duboin's 2@C opening bid may look strange, but Bocchi and Duboin play a bidding system with many unusual elements. One of these is their 2@C opening bid, which is used to show a weak hand with at least 4-4 in the majors. Conventions like this one can be very hard to defend against, but as you will see, they sometimes backfire by giving an astute declarer too much information about the defenders' hands.|

lc|dakqhakcak|hs|wd|hs|wc|hs|eh|at|With hearts, diamonds, and clubs all lying badly it looks like a uphill battle to win 8 tricks, to say nothing of 9. Watch how Ramondt played brilliantly to overcome these bad breaks. |

ls|eh|ls|nh|nt|Ramondt's efforts to lose so many early tricks had the effect of ^*Brectifying the count^*N down to the 1 loser that the above ^*Bsimple squeeze^*N position requires. |
