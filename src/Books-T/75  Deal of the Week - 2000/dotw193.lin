^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week #193 - May 22, 2000^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played by ^*BBridge Base Inc.^*N President ^*BFred Gitelman^*N during the recent ^*BCavendish Invitational Pairs^*N in Las Vegas. Fred's partner was Brad Moss. Full coverage of the 2000 Cavendish is available through:

This week's deal is presented as a declarer play problem. You should be warned in advance that we are not sure we have the right answer to this problem. There are 2 reasonable lines of play and the odds are very close between these 2 lines. We do know what the winning play was when this deal was played at the Cavendish, where there were hundreds of IMPs and hundreds of thousands of dollars at stake. See how you would have done.

pg| ***** 1 ***** |


mb|P|mb|1N|an|12-14 HCP|ls|sh|at|and Brad rebid 1NT, showing a balanced hand with 12-14 points (possibly with 4 spades). Fred and Brad bypass 4-card majors to rebid 1NT on all balanced hands unsuitable for raising partner's major.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|This approach is not "standard" which calls for a 1@S rebid on balanced hands with 4 spades. The advantage of bypassing 1@S to rebid 1NT is that when opener ^*Idoes^*N rebid 1@S the responder immediately knows his partner has an ^*Bunbalanced^*N hand. This early knowledge often makes subsequent bidding (especially 4th suit auctions) easier and more accurate.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|The disadvantage of opener bypassing 1@S to rebid 1NT is that, if responder does not have enough strength to invite game over opener's 1NT rebid, a 4-4 spade fit could be "lost". The partnership could play the wrong partscore (1NT instead of 2@S). If responder has enough to at least invite game the 4-4 spade fit can still be found via ^*BCheckback Stayman^*N or ^*BNew Minor Forcing^*N.|

mb|P|mb|2D|an|Artificial game force|mb|P|mb|2H|an|3@H and not 4@S|
nt|Fred and Brad use ^*B2-Way Checkback Stayman^*N after opener rebids 1NT. 2@C is used for all invitational hands and 2@D (as Fred bid here) is used for all game forcing hands that require more information. Brad's 2@H response showed 3-card support for hearts, but denied 4@S. Fred now knew that Brad was dealt either 2353, 3352, or 2344 distribution.|

mb|P|mb|3H|an|Slam try|
hs|sh|nt|Fred's 3@H was a slam try, setting hearts as trump |

mb|P|mb|4N|an|RKCB 1430|mb|P|mb|5H|an|2 Keycards, no @HQ|
at|Fred launched into ^*BRoman Keycard Blackwood^*N (1430 responses) and Brad's 5@H showed the missing 2 keycards (the @HK and the @DA) but denied the @HQ.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


mb|P|mb|5S|an|Asking for Kings|
nt|Fred and Brad play that after a response to RKCB, the cheapest step that is not a signoff and does not ask for the Queen of trump is a "surrogate" for 5NT - asking for Kings. This approach maximizes the space available for grand slam exploration. Here Fred was able to use 5@S (instead of 5NT) to ask for ^*Bspecific^*N Kings. Brad could bid a minor suit King at the 6-level or respond 5NT with the @SK.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


mb|P|mb|7H|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|
nt|Brad took the bull by the horns, however, and leapt to 7@H himself which became the final contract. Fred's 5@S told Brad that the partnesrhip held all 5 keycards as well as the @HQ and gave Brad rights to bid a grand slam. "No doubt Brad has excellent diamonds as well as the @CK," thought Fred with confidence.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||pc|CT|
nt|West led the @C10 and Fred became considerably less confident when he saw the dummy. The grand slam had reasonable play, but was far from being laydown. Perhaps Brad should have contented himself with 6@D (showing the @DK) over Fred's 5@S King ask. Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||hs|nc|lb|*CWhat card would you play?^^cq^cq76|
ls|nc|pc|CQ|nt|You might as well play the @CQ from dummy. It is highly unlikely that West has led from the @CK, but you never know. If you think about the hand carefully, the @CQ has no value as a squeeze threat against the @CK with East and if West has the @CK you might as well play the @CQ now!|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


pc|CK|pc|CA|at| Not surprisingly, the @CQ is covered by East with the @CK and won with the @CA.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


hs|ss|hs|nh|nt|There are layouts in which it is necessary to immediately start by ruffing a spade in dummy in order to make the contract. These layouts are quite obscure, however, and a ruffing a spade in dummy will make it impossible to pick up 4 hearts to the @HJ in East's hand (unless you are looking at all 4 hands).|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|ss|hs|sh|nt|Fred thought it was best to test the distribution of the trump suit by cashing a high heart in his hand |

ls|nh|pc|H4|pc|H9|pc|HK|pc|H8|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


at|Both defenders followed small to the first 2 rounds of trump. If West had discarded on the second round Fred would have drawn the rest of East's trump (with the help of the marked finesse) and hoped to take the right view in diamonds at the end.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|Sd|nt|The 3-2 trump break certainly helped matters, but the contract still appeared to depend on running the diamonds. The percentage play in diamonds is to play the suit from the top. Diamonds will break 3-3 or the @DJ will be doubleton roughly 52% of the time (a little more given the 3-2 heart break). Can you see a way to give yourself any extra chances if the diamonds do not come down?|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


ls|sd|ls|nd|hs|ss|hs|ns|nt|Fred found an extra chance, but it was not without risk. Fred left a trump outstanding and played a spade to his hand. |

sk||hs|es|hs|ed|nt|Fred's decision to ruff a spade in the dummy proved to be a good move as you can see by looking at the remaining East-West cards. East was dealt a diamond stopper along with the long spade.

pg| ***** 40 ***** |


ls|nd|up|32|hs|es|hs|ed|nt|This is the critical point in the play where Fred chose to give himself the extra chance of squeezing East in spades and diamonds. This proved to be the winning move on the actual lie of the cards. |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


md|0,d5,,s7|at|The downside of Fred's line can be seen by giving East 1 more spade and 1 less diamond. |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


ls|es|ls|ed|hs|ws|hs|wh|nt|West, with the long heart and only 2 spades, could ruff the third round of spades in front of dummy to defeat a contract that could have been made simply by drawing trump and running diamonds. Fred was aware of this downside, but was not capable of computing odds of the 2 lines at the table. It felt close. One advantage of the squeeze line was that it would provide a nice ^*BDeal of the Week^*N if it was successful!|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|Computer analysis has suggested that the odds were extemely close. After both defenders follow to the first 2 rounds of trump, layouts like the one above, where playing to ruff a spade loses and drawing trump would have won, occur about 11.4% of the time. |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


ls|ws|ls|wh|hs|es|hs|ed|md|0,s7,,d5|at|Layouts where it is necessary to ruff a spade and later squeeze East occur about 11.6% of the time. Lucky guess by Fred!|
