(rightclick on your desktop,select "personalize" "screen defenitions")
Also, make sure you have "widescreen" checked in your windows BBO-version
(If you're not sure about your settings log into your BBO windows version then:  
click the yellow tool at bottom and under the "general" tab check "widescreen" and save)
This will prevent the "cutting off" of the bottom parts or scrambling of your text in these presentations.

If you downloaded BBO recently, you will not be able to get online with the windows version...
You can still change or check your settings: 
Go to your C disc, and under "programs" find the Bridge Base Online folder
Open it and find the "profiles" folder
Open and scroll to find: BBO_Default_Settings 
line 71 should read: WIDE_CLIENT=1
If your setting is 0, change it to 1 and save. This will change your settings to "widescreen".

zaXXon: Hi people, welcome! Nice to meet you again :)
For those of you who are joining me for the first time - my name is Zahari, or just Harry :) 
and I'll be glad to spend a few hours with you, talking about our favorite game.
Today: The Suit Preperence Signal|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|

There is a most important and simple difference between the declarer and defenders...
Do you know what it is?
Declarer always knows what the dummy will play, simply because he commands it!
It's not the same for the defense - many times you will expect your partner to play a spade, but he will choose a diamond instead
...and you lose the contract...

So, to avoid these hurdles, the defenders use some signals to help each other.
One of the most popular carding is the "suit preference signal"
The idea is simple - when you have few cards in a suit and its "irrelevant" which one you will play, 
you choose the rank of the card to show interest in the same ranking side-suit

Simply said, if you want your partner to play the higher ranking suit, you play high card
...and vice-versa
Here is the most popular example for this idea
GOOD LUCK !


MM: Though during the sessions Harry took al 4 seats, in this presentation you will be South
Quiz questions are added and at the end of each hand you will have the option to replay "Double Dummy"
(all 4 hands shown, where you can click the cards to play, where you can try a different line as well)

lb|*mWho has the singleton?^Partner~Declarer^1|at|
zaXXon: the missing heart is the @h9
and from 98 doubleton partner would lead the 9

nt||
lb|*cWhich heart should you play?^^h2^H6432|at|
zaXXon: and we must give him suit preference
this is a tricky one :)
We know partner can't ruff more than once, because declarer has only 2 hearts
If we ask for diamond return, we would not score our @cK
AND a @c return removes the only entry to dummy, so declarer can't enjoy the rest of the hearts
so, we play our smallest heart|

the problem is ...|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt||at|
that we can't give suit preference with our 3rd club - we will be forced to play our honor
(due to the J in dummy)       so, our clubs are not irrelevant...
However, here we have 2 equal cards - @cK and @cQ      and we can use them to show suit preference!
order: @cQ then @cK asking for the lower ranking suit
and playing the @cK first asks for the higher suit...
This is just a variation - equal cards can always be used for suit preference, even being honors|

lb|*cWhat would be your next play?^^d7^S3HQJ987CT982D74|at|zaXXon: Well, its a typical position when partner takes an Ace and dummy comes down with a singleton.
In that case, showing count or attitude is non-sense
Partner will shift for sure - you may tell him where you prefer
Here partner played the @h6, the highest missing heart except for the K (missing are K6543)
and we dont know if he has the King at all, but if we notice this card, we must play... a diamond|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


nt||at|
wyoming33: since north raised it figures partner has the K and 6 is next highest
zaXXon: What is wrong to raise with @h6543 without the King?

up|7|sk||at|zaXXon: Well, partner produces a second Ace for -1
and he indead has @h6543, not the King
But he has nice distribution to bid to 5@h 
Please note, that if you play something different, the diamonds from dummy will disappear!
KCNatte:  can you explain why 3 H not 2 H?|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: Well, 2@h or 3@h is a question of style
If you prefer 2nd level ^*uovercalls^*n to be decent, you have to bid 3@h, because your hand is weak
If you never bid 3x with 6 cards, then you should overcall 2@h (which for most will suggest a stronnger hand than this)
Yet you have a great suit and 6-4 distribution, bidding 3@h seems fine
bABsG:  and favourable vul to boot!  :)

Now            @d94  are equals and can be used for suit preference!
