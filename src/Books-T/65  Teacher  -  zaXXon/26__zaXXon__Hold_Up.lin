Also, make sure you have "widescreen" checked in your windows BBO-version
(If you're not sure about your settings log into your BBO windows version then:  
click the yellow tool at bottom and under the "general" tab check "widescreen" and save)
This will prevent the "cutting off" of the bottom parts or scrambling of your text in these presentations.

If you downloaded BBO recently, you will not be able to get online with the windows version...
You can still change or check your settings: 
Go to your C disc, and under "programs" find the Bridge Base Online folder
Open it and find the "profiles" folder
Open and scroll to find: BBO_Default_Settings 
line 71 should read: WIDE_CLIENT=1
If your setting is 0, change it to 1 and save.

As an ALTERNATIVE: Open your aaBridge program and simply drag and drop the file of this presentation

fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|^b@2zaXXon: Hi people, welcome!  I'm happy that you decided to join me today. This session is 
the first (of five) which I'm going to present during September on 5 different topics - three over some aspects of declarer play and two about defense.

Presenting now is -
^c@2Session 1: "Hold up play" - and sessions to follow are - 
Session 2: "Suit Preference Signals" (defense) 
Session 3: "Secure your contract"   
Session 4: "Counting is everything"  and 
Session 5: "Allow yourself to be lucky" (defense)

^b@2For those of you who are joining me for the first time - my name is Zahari, or just Harry :) 
and I'll be glad to spend a few hours with you, talking about our favorite game.

^*bHold-Up play^*n

Once the lead is made and the dummy comes down; it's time for you to plan your play.
If you could win the first trick, then you are facing your first problem - to take or to hold-up.
When and how long to hold-up is tricky and the decision should be based on certain circumstances...
Declarer usually holds-up to:
^c@2- Cut the communications for the defense
- To isolate a dangerous opponent
- To win a tempo
- To protect his holding in the suit

fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^fIntroduction (Continued) }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2To take correct decisions, declarer should never consider the led suit in isolation, 
but to watch it in the view of whole hand.

There are few basic circumstances and they could help a lot in solving the problems:
^c@2- The holding in led suit, weak or strong enough;
- What distribution of led suit could put the contract on risk;
- Is there another suit with a weaker holding, where defense could hurt equal or more, if they switch there;
- Which opponent is dangerous and which one is not;
- What is the plan of the play, when defenders will gain the lead - how many times and in what order...

First board is a typical basic example to see how it works:

lb|*mWhere can you get additional tricks?^@s~@d~@c~@H^4|at|
zaXXon:  So the Ace of hearts should be knocked out soon.  
There would be no problem if spades are divided 4-4 and not a chance in the world to make if either defender has 5 or more spades together with the @hA.  
So, you need to cut the communications between defenders (in case 5-3)  
You could increase your chances by holding-up the @sA until the 3rd round of the suit, before playing on hearts.|

at|zaXXon: Note, you can hold up as there is no other suit to worry about. 
After that, you knock out the @hA.   If long spades and @hA are in different hands, the contract is safe, 
and you can claim your 10 tricks.  If you take your @sA earlier, you will go down easy enough..|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt| |at|KCNatte:  So is it rule of 7?
zaXXon: It's about whether to hold-up until the dangerous number you are afraid of 
-- 5 spades somewhere -- meaning 3 spades with the other defender 
so you hold-up twice, and if, after winning the @hA, East produces another spade, the suit will mostly lay 4-4.

at|zaXXon:  This way you keep out the dangerous East on assumption that West has @cA.
Again: there is no switch, which can harm you.  
If clubs behave 3-3, you will finish with 10 tricks but at least you have 9 cold now.|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |

at|One question, why do we expect @cA to be with West?|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


at|
intempo2: because East is weak.
annmorton:  Contract fails if in East so assume what you need.
c3cummins:  With west @cA, because that would give East too many points to preempt?
ljmacleod:  East has less than 13 points|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


at|
zaXXon: right, all of you - with @hAQJ9xx and @cA East would open 1@h, instead of weak 2; 
and yes - we need to find it with West :)|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt||at|
KCNatte:  What if West has @HQ and on second round East leads @HJ - do I take it or still hold up?
zaXXon: if East continues with another heart, not Ace, you put your King on second round.

pc|sQ|at|zaXXon: Same contract 3NT  - This time with 2 stoppers
West leads his suit. 
 
You only have 4 top tricks and both hearts and clubs have to be established.  Here you have 2 stops in the led suit, but you have to clear 2 suits to collect your tricks.  This means that defense will take the lead 2 more times and there is a danger of losing 3 spades + 2 Aces. |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt| |
at|zaXXon:  True, from the bidding it is very likely that the @C and @H Aces are split between defenders, but you don't know which one to drive out first.  (West could open 1st position 1@s with @sQJ109x + @hA @cA but passed) |

LB|*cWhich card should declarer play?^^S7^SK97|


nt||
at|zaXXon:  Imagine, that you win the 1st spade and you play a suit (@h or @c).  If you hit East's Ace he will clear spades, and when you later play your second suit to West's Ace... he will enjoy his spades for down one.  
So, You should hold-up the lead from both hands and should take the spade continuation.|

at|zaXXon:  If East happens to have a 3rd spade, then spades would be 4-3 and the contact would be in no danger at all.
(in rare case West overcalled with a 4-card) With East out of spades, you have all the time in the world. 
IF you guess correct, to play clubs first, you would make your 3NT even without holding up the 1st spade 
but why guess when you have a 100% line?

zaXXon:  Once again there are two minor Aces to be removed and to avoid the guessing element, you should duck the spade 
lead twice.  There is no dangerous shift and this way West is running out of spades.  
When you take the 3rd one ...you may play any minor.  
Aces can be dealt in any order... if you take 1st or 2nd spade and guess wrong 
(accidently hit West's Ace first, allowing East to hold on to the entry till their suit is cleared next), you are down.|
