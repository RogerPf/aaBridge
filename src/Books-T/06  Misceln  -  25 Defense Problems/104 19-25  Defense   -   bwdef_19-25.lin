NT|^b@2 
A WAITING GAME. With the advantage of discarding after the dummy, East should not throw a spade or a club until dummy does. A premature black-suit discard gives declarer a twelfth trick. The correct defense is to underruff at trick two and hope for a black-suit trick later.|pc|H2|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Although this is a rather tricky and unusual example, it does illustrate the important defensive principle of "keeping parity with dummy". That means you should, when possible, keep the same length as dummy in all of dummy's long suits. The reason for this principle is so that you do not set up a low card in dummy that declarer would otherwise be unable to cash. On this example, until dummy discards a black suit, you must keep 3 clubs (to stay even with dummy's club length) and 4 spades (to stay even with dummy' spade length). Therefore your only play, far from obvious but logical if you think about it, is to throw a heart.|

ROYAL SACRIFICE. As West cannot have much more in high cards than the spade honors he has already shown, East's only realistic hope for defeating the contract is to shut out dummy's diamonds.|pc|s3sas5|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


NT|^b@2
This can be accomplished by shifting to the king of hearts at trick two, to kill dummy's side entry. If declarer holds up in hearts, East can continue with a second round.|PC|hkh3h2ha|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|The important defensive principle here is that, when declarer makes a NT bid or overcall, you can usually figure out approximately how many HCP partner has. How do you do that? Well, let's use this hand as an example. Add your HCP to dummy's HCP. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, the total is 20 (13 HCP in your hand plus 7 HCP) in dummy. that leaves 20 HCP between declarer and partner. You know, from the 1N overcall, that South has 15-18 HCP. That leaves 2-5 HCP for partner. You should get in the habit of doing this calculation on EVERY SINGLE HAND where declarer opens or overcalls NT and therefore narrowly defines his HCP total.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|On this particular hand, you have the additional information that partner has 3 HCP in spades, based on the lead (Q from QJ). So that means partner has, at most, 2 additional HCP (and that declarer has no more than 17 HCP).|

MAKE IT EASY. On the bidding, East can have only one ace or king. The defense has no chance unless that card is an ace, and it is most likely (in view of South's two-notrump bid) that it is the ace of hearts.|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|This is a similar defensive principle to Board 20 despite the fact that South did not open or overcall 1NT. Although you cannot be sure exactly how many HCP South has, you know South made an invitational bid, so he has a medium opener (15-17 points or so). |
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Using the same method as on Board 20, add your HCP to dummy. That gives a total of 19, leaving 21 HCP between partner and declarer. Give declarer an average of 16 HCP, leaving 5 for partner. The point is, as indicated in the commentary, there is no room in partner's hand for more than one ace or king.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Could partner have the @CK rather than the HA? Certainly. But, in that case, since dummy only has 2 clubs, you cannot defeat the contract. Therefore, you have to hope that partner has the 1 holding that will allow you to defeat the contract.|

NT|^b@2
In that case, the defense can either cash two spade tricks or use spades to force trumps out of declarer's hand, perhaps producing a trump trick for East through extra length. When South has a singleton spade, a spade to West's ace and a spade back will force out one trump, but will also leave a third-round spade stopper in dummy.|

ON THE HORIZON. On the bidding, West cannot hope for East to show up with as much as the spade king and club queen, though he can reasonably hope for one of those cards. If declarer does not have two diamond losers, there is no hope for the defense. Therefore, West should continue with the king of diamonds at trick two, which will amount to the setting trick when East has the king of spades.|pc|dkdtd3d6|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


sk||NT|^b@2
When East has the queen of clubs, more defensive effort is necessary. West should continue with a third round of diamonds, intending to lead a fourth round of the suit when on lead with the ace of spades. This will allow East to ruff declarer's potential second diamond winner, preventing the disposal of declarer's losing club.|

INSTRUCTIONS 
^-|ht|d|CP||fp||at|^C@2^z@3The movie follows the book's protocol. First, you see the North/South hands with the contract and the opening lead. You, sitting South, are asked to analyze the hand and plan a successful line of play.

Next, you will see the four hands where you can use the double dummy feature to test your line of play. When you are done, you can click the forward arrow and read the authors' solution. Finally, if you wish, you can again play the board double dummy or move on to the next problem.

What is ^*B"double dummy?"^*N  When you play ^*B"double dummy,"^*N you see all four hands�it�s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from each of the other hands. You will find you are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to 'take it.' Now, you may lead the next card�from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the folded trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the undo button in the Viewer to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other�use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, ^*Bif you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.^*N
