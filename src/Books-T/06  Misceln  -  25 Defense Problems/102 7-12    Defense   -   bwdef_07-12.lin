^*BSolution^*N: FIRST THINGS FIRST. With only five tricks in sight (two clubs, a club ruff, and two aces), East must prepare for a diamond ruff before giving partner a club ruff.|PG||NT|^b@2
The club ruff is needed as a later entry to West's hand, so that East can get a diamond ruff. Therefore, the correct defense is for East to win the second trick with the king of clubs, and shift to ace and another diamond.|pc|dad5d4d2|PG||pc|d6d7d3dj|PG||sk||pf|Y|NT|^b@2
Later, East can win the first round of trumps with the ace, give partner a club ruff, and receive a diamond ruff in return for the setting trick. Giving West a club ruff at trick three would prematurely remove the entry needed for the diamond ruff. |PG||NT|^b@2

^*BSolution^*N: WATCH THE SPOTS.|pg||AT| Since (in view of the bidding) it is a moral certainty that declarer will be unable to take nine tricks without using dummy's diamonds, West can see a sure set by overtaking the queen of clubs and forcing out South's jack with the eight.

^*BSolution^*N: WAIT AND SEE. West's problem is, after wining this trick--if he must, to figure out whether to lead a heart or a diamond to get East on lead for the club ruff that will be the setting trick. With a surplus trump, West should duck the first spade lead. Then, on the second spade lead, East can give an unambiguous signal to indicate the suit West should lead. It is then easy for West to lead a heart and get the club ruff.|PG||sk||pf|y|NT|^b@2

^*BSolution^*N: SAVE THE ACE. If East plays the ace of spades at trick one, depriving the defense of a later entry to play a spade through South, declarer can make the contract no matter how the subsequent defense goes. However, if East plays his queen of spades at trick one, the defense is in control. If South ducks, the continuation of the ace and another spade will set up four tricks for the defense while it still has a diamond entry. |sk||PG||sk||NT|^b@2
Alternatively, if South wins the king of spades on trick one, West will eventually get the lead with the king of diamonds and be able to run four spade tricks, using the spade ace as a critical entry for a lead trough the spade nine.|PG||NT||
cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|This, probably, is a somewhat artificial board. In general, West should not lead a spade on this auction (although granted he has no good lead because with Qx in hearts, the unbid suit, a heart lead looks wrong also). But in general, leading a suit the opponents have bid is not a good idea. |PG||NT||
cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|There is an one advanced opening lead concept which is an exception to this rule. When declarer has bid a suit that is likely to be exactly 4 cards in length. and you hold 4+ cards in the suit with 2 honors (or even 1 honor and the 10 or 9), leading that suit, although a bit risky, can work out well. So, if West had started with A10xxx or Q10xxx of spades, a spade is probably the best lead. But with 10xxxx, although it happens to work out on this hand, it is normally not a good lead. |PG||NT||
cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|At an actual table, had partner led a spade, I would have assumed he had K10xxx. Although it turns out I still should play the @SQ at trick 1, even if he has that holding, I easily might have played the @SA and then the @SQ. Having said that, the general principle of having the defense duck to preserve communications, particularly in NT, is a good principle to remember. It is mirror image of why declarer ducks. For the defense, ducking preserves communication, whereas for declarer ducking severs communication.|PG||NT||

^*BSolution^*N: THIRD-HAND LOW. East should duck the first trick in the hope that West started with two spades and an entry. West must get on lead with his entry (the queen of clubs) and lead a spade before East's entry (the ace of clubs) is knocked out. This defense is sure to beat the contract, since South cannot get nine tricks without running the clubs.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West discarded a lower spade than his lead. So based on West's carding (which, assuming a 4th best lead) this shows West had 5 spades. Therefore, an expert East can count out South's hand starting with 2 spades, 5 hearts, 2 clubs, and therefore 4 diamonds.|Pc|haht|PG||

^*BSolution^*N: NOW OR NEVER. The only hope for the defense is to cash three diamond tricks before declarer can discard another diamond on the fourth club lead. Therefore, East must ruff the third round of clubs and lead a low diamond to avoid blocking the suit for the defense. West must cooperate by winning the first round of diamonds with the ace, another unblock, and then returning the suit. Next you can play the entire hand double dummy.|PG||nt||

INSTRUCTIONS 
^-|ht|d|CP||fp||at|^C@2^z@3The movie follows the book's protocol. First, you see the North/South hands with the contract and the opening lead. You, sitting South, are asked to analyze the hand and plan a successful line of play.

Next, you will see the four hands where you can use the double dummy feature to test your line of play. When you are done, you can click the forward arrow and read the authors' solution. Finally, if you wish, you can again play the board double dummy or move on to the next problem.

What is ^*B"double dummy?"^*N  When you play ^*B"double dummy,"^*N you see all four handsï¿½itï¿½s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from each of the other hands. You will find you are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to 'take it.' Now, you may lead the next cardï¿½from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the folded trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the undo button in the Viewer to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the otherï¿½use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, ^*Bif you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.^*N 

Now please, click|CP|1|at|^*GB, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your main page. |PG||
