^*BSolution^*N: KEEP IN TOUCH. East, reading the four-of-spades lead as a singleton or a doubleton, should realize that the contract cannot be set unless West started with a doubleton spade and a quick entry, such as the queen of diamonds. If East withholds the king and jack of spades from the first trick, West will have a spade left to lead when in with his entry card (the second spade lead clears the suit, so East can run the suit when in with the ace of diamonds). If East releases the king or jack of spades on the first trick, declarer should make the contract bid by ducking the first spade lead and winning the second.|PG||nt||

GUARD THE QUEEN. The declarer cannot make the contract if West leads the jack of clubs when on lead with the queen of diamonds. This play is clearly indicated after analyzing declarer's possible club holdings. The concealed club holding must be something like Q-x, Q-x-x, K-x-x, or K-8-x; otherwise, declarer would have the rest of the tricks. Any club lead beats the slam if South has one of the first three holdings. The critical case is K-8-x, against which the jack of clubs is the only lead that will surely succeed. |sk||PG||nt||up|32|sc||cs|6|ht|c|at|

USELESS RUFF-SLUFF. East is faced with the crucial defensive play after winning the third lead of hearts and cashing his spade trick. The lead of a spade or a club, even though it gives declarer a sluff and a ruff, will surely defeat the contract. In contrast, if East leads any diamond, declarer can make the game. The key to determining the correct play is for East to count the suit distribution and calculate that South started with a four-card diamond suit; in that case, a sluff and a ruff cannot possibly hurt the defense. |sk||PG||NT|^B@2
Declarer's hand can be counted as follows: South followed suit to three spade tricks and showed out on the second round of clubs. West showed out on the second lead of hearts. Therefore, South started with three spades, one club, five hearts and, consequently, four diamonds.|PG||up|32|nt||sc||cs|6|ht|c|at|

^*BSolution^*N: PERSISTENCE PAYS OFF. East should cash two club tricks, and then try to figure a way to help his partner take a trick (which would defeat the contract). The bidding should have made it clear that West cannot have the ace of hearts, and consequently cannot win any tricks in hearts or diamonds. |PG||NT|^b@2
The only hope is that West has a possible spade trick: 10-x-x or 9-x-x-x. By leading a club at trick three (the sluff-ruff cannot possibly help declarer since he has no losers in the side suits), and holding up with the ace of spades until the second spade is played from dummy, East can then promote a trump trick for West by leading a fourth club. |PG||NT|^B@2
It would be inferior defense for East to lead a diamond in the hope that his partner had a singleton or a void; it is impractical to assume that South would have bid as he did with three or four diamonds. Also, West would probably have led a diamond if he had a singleton.|PG||nt||

^*BSolution^*N: NOW OR NEVER. After winning the first trick, East should realize that the only chance to defeat the contract is to take three club tricks before the defense loses the lead. Therefore, East should underlead the ace of clubs at trick two, hoping to find partner with the king of clubs doubleton, or the queen of clubs doubleton (hoping declarer misguesses which club to play when the ace is underled).|PG||pf|y|sk||NT|^b@2 
Did you notice that the challenge was to plan the defense rather than the more usual request to plan your defense? West, on the same reasoning, should return a club at trick three. And East should overtake the second club to give the ruff. To make it easier for partner to do the right thing, with the cards as shown in the diagram West should win the first club with the king, then return the jack. Similarly, from king-queen doubleton West should play king-then-queen, to alert East to the need to do something unusual.|PG||NT||cp|8|AT|

West leads the nine of diamonds against 4@S by South. Plan your defense and defeat the contract if possible. BTW, I am sure you already figured out that @D9 is a singleton.

^*BSolution^*N: FIRST THINGS FIRST. East should win the diamond lead and lead a heart at trick two. (It is essential to establish a heart trick for the defense before giving partner a diamond ruff. If East instead gives West a ruff at trick two, declarer can avoid the loss of a heart trick.) This line of defense will net four tricks--ace of spades, ace of diamonds, king of hearts and a diamond ruff.|sk||PG||NT|^b@2 
Delaying the diamond ruff cannot lose, since West is marked with two spades: The nine-of-diamonds lead places the queen-jack-ten of diamonds in declarer's hand, and South would not have enough high cards for an opening bid unless he held a heart honor; with a maximum of nine black cards, South would not open the bidding with one club if he held five spades.|PG||nt||

INSTRUCTIONS 
^-|ht|d|CP||fp||at|^C@2^z@3The movie follows the book's protocol. First, you see the North/South hands with the contract and the opening lead. You, sitting South, are asked to analyze the hand and plan a successful line of play.

Next, you will see the four hands where you can use the double dummy feature to test your line of play. When you are done, you can click the forward arrow and read the authors' solution. Finally, if you wish, you can again play the board double dummy or move on to the next problem.

What is ^*B"double dummy?"^*N  When you play ^*B"double dummy,"^*N you see all four hands�it�s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from each of the other hands. You will find you are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to 'take it.' Now, you may lead the next card�from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the folded trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the undo button in the Viewer to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other�use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, ^*Bif you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.^*N|PG||
