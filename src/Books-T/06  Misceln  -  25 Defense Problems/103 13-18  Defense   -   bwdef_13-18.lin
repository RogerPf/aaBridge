^*BSolution^*N: BEHIND THE 8-BALL. It should be clear to East, when he wins the diamond king, that three notrump will make unless the defense takes four spade tricks immediately. (Declarer, upon regaining the lead, will take two hearts, five diamonds, and one club.)|pc|dk|

By leading the spade eight, East can get four spade tricks for the defense if West holds spades at least as strong as king-jack-seven-small. |

|NT|^b@2
In contrast, if East leads the spade deuce, declarer may play so that the suit becomes blocked. Regardless of the card of East's shift, it should be clear to West to return the spade lead. West also can see that declarer has nine tricks after any other return.|

^*BSolution^*N: PRESERVE YOUR HONOR. East should overtake the first trick with his ace of hearts, so he can lead a trump through declarer and thus cut down dummy's ruffing power while doing as little damage as possible to the defensive trump holding.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT|^b@2 
By leading the three instead of the jack, East makes it possible for West to draw two trumps from dummy without sacrificing a second defensive spade trick.|

^*BSolution^*N: TUNNEL AN ENTRY. Upon winning the second trick, West should realize that South must have the king of hearts for his opening bid. So, the only hope for beating the contract is that East has the jack of hearts. By leading the queen of hearts at trick three, West forces out declarer's king, creating an entry to partner's hand (the Deschapelles Coup).|PC|sq|

Sk||NT|^b@2
Then, on winning the second trump lead, West can lead the deuce of hearts to East's jack and get a club ruff. Any other defense allows South eventually to draw the trumps and discard two hearts on dummy's clubs.|

^*BSolution^*N: A SWITCH IN TIME. West's opening lead is "top of nothing," so a club continuation by East would be futile.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |

PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT|^b@2
On the good chance that West has one entry (probably a spade stopper), a heart return is very promising. |
pc|h6|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Switching to the heart queen or heart jack beats the contract when West has at least three hearts. The best shift is to the heart six, which succeeds when West has the hoped-for entry and as many as two hearts. |

^*BSolution^*N: MAKE IT EASY. Upon winning the ace of hearts, East can see that the contract can be set if West has the ace of clubs.|PC|H5hahj|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT|^b@2
However, because West may have no late entry to his club winner, the defense must get its three club tricks with two top cards and a ruff. |
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


Sk||NT|^b@2
To indicate a doubleton club, East should shift to the @cQ, reversing the normal order of play. |pc|cqc4c9c3|cp|8|AT|

^y@3^c@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|The unusual play of the @CQ from @CKQ doubleton is sometimes called an "alarm clock" play. 
It basically says, "Partner, I have done something unusual. WAKE UP and figure out why I have made this unusual play."|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT|^b@2
This will help alert West to the need to overtake on the second round. The rest is easy.|PC|ckc5cac7|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT|^b@2
(West might overtake if East played king then queen, on the theory that East should play low the second time if he had another club, but it always helps to make it easier for partner. Cashing the ace of spades before playing clubs also might draw attention to the need to take three fast tricks.)|

^*BSolution^*N: X-RAY VISION. To avoid allowing declarer to get early heart discards on dummy's diamonds, East should signal encouragement in hearts (with the ten, if high cards are used as encouraging).|PC|h9hth3|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT|^b@2
After winning the second trick with the heart king,|PC|h5hjhkhq|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT|^b@2
East should visualize declarer with  5215  or  5206  distribution and all the missing high cards (for the opening bid).|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


Sk||NT|^b@2
Any defense will suffice against  5206, but if South is  5215, East must shift to a diamond (preferably the ten, in case declarer's singleton is the nine) to prevent South from using the bulk of dummy's diamonds.|PC|dt|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT|^b@2
If East instead leads a club or a spade, declarer has ten tricks: five spades, four diamonds and one club. |
