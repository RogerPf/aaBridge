^*BSolution^*N: BEHIND THE 8-BALL. It should be clear to East, when he wins the diamond king, that three notrump will make unless the defense takes four spade tricks immediately. (Declarer, upon regaining the lead, will take two hearts, five diamonds, and one club.)|pc|dk|PG||NT||lb|*mWhich suit should East attack?^Clubs~Diamonds~Hearts~Spades^4|NT|^b@2
By leading the spade eight, East can get four spade tricks for the defense if West holds spades at least as strong as king-jack-seven-small. |sk||PG||pf|y|NT|^b@2
|NT|^b@2
In contrast, if East leads the spade deuce, declarer may play so that the suit becomes blocked. Regardless of the card of East's shift, it should be clear to West to return the spade lead. West also can see that declarer has nine tricks after any other return. Go ahead and try it. The ^*BD^*Nouble ^*BD^*Nummy feature is on.

North is the dealer and North-South are vulnerable. West leads the heart king against 3@S by South.|PG||NT|^b@2 
Plan your defense to defeat the contract if possible. Next is the solution. As a hint note that North is almost bankrupt.|PG||NT|^b@2
^*BSolution^*N: PRESERVE YOUR HONOR. East should overtake the first trick with his ace of hearts, so he can lead a trump through declarer and thus cut down dummy's ruffing power while doing as little damage as possible to the defensive trump holding.|PG||sk||NT|^b@2 
By leading the three instead of the jack, East makes it possible for West to draw two trumps from dummy without sacrificing a second defensive spade trick.

East is the dealer and both sides are vulnerable. You (West) lead the club six against 4@S by South. |PG||NT|^b@2
Dummy wins with the eight (East plays the seven).|PC|c8c7c2|PG||NT|^b@2
And Dummy continues with the nine of spades followed by the deuce three spades. Now what?|PC|s9s2s3|PG||NT|^b@2 
Plan your defense and defeat the contract if possible. Next is the solution. |PG||NT|^b@2 
^*BSolution^*N: TUNNEL AN ENTRY. Upon winning the second trick, West should realize that South must have the king of hearts for his opening bid. So, the only hope for beating the contract is that East has the jack of hearts. By leading the queen of hearts at trick three, West forces out declarer's king, creating an entry to partner's hand (the Deschapelles Coup).|PC|sq|PG||pc|hqh5h7hk|PG||Sk||NT|^b@2
Then, on winning the second trump lead, West can lead the deuce of hearts to East's jack and get a club ruff. Any other defense allows South eventually to draw the trumps and discard two hearts on dummy's clubs.|PG||PF|y|NT|^b@2

West leads club nine against 3N by South. Plan your defense and defeat the contract if possible. Next is the solution.|pc|c9|PG||NT|^b@2
^*BSolution^*N: A SWITCH IN TIME. West's opening lead is "top of nothing," so a club continuation by East would be futile. On the good chance that West has one entry (probably a spade stopper), a heart return is very promising. |pc|c2cact|PG||pc|h6|PG||NT|^b@2
Switching to the heart queen or heart jack beats the contract when West has at least three hearts. The best shift is to the heart six, which succeeds when West has the hoped-for entry and as many as two hearts. |PG||NT|^b@2

West is the dealer and neither side is vulnerable.|PG||NT|^b@2 
You are defending 3@S contract and West leads the heart four. Plan your defense and defeat the contract if possible. Next is the solution. |PC|h4|PG||NT|^b@2
^*BSolution^*N: MAKE IT EASY. Upon winning the ace of hearts, East can see that the contract can be set if West has the ace of clubs.|PC|H5hahj|PG||NT|^b@2
However, because West may have no late entry to his club winner, the defense must get its three club tricks with two top cards and a ruff. |PG||Sk||NT|^b@2
To indicate a doubleton club, East should shift to the queen of clubs, reversing the normal order of play. |pc|cqc4c9c3|cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|The unusual play of the @CQ from @CQK doubleton is sometimes called an "alarm clock" play. It basically says, "Partner, I have done something unusual. WAKE UP and figure out why I have made this unusual play."|PG||NT|^b@2
This will help alert West to the need to overtake on the second round. The rest is easy.|PC|ckc5cac7|PG|c6|PG||NT|^b@2
(West might overtake if East played king then queen, on the theory that East should play low the second time if he had another club, but it always helps to make it easier for partner. Cashing the ace of spades before playing clubs also might draw attention to the need to take three fast tricks.)|PG||up|12|pf|y|NT|^b@2

South is the dealer and East-West are vulnerable.|PG||NT|^b@2 
West leads the heart ace. Plan your defense and defeat the contract if possible. Next is the solution.|pc|ha|PG||NT|^b@2 
^*BSolution^*N: X-RAY VISION. To avoid allowing declarer to get early heart discards on dummy's diamonds, East should signal encouragement in hearts (with the ten, if high cards are used as encouraging).|PC|h9hth3|PG||NT|^b@2
After winning the second trick with the heart king,|PC|h5hjhkhq|PG||NT|^b@2
East should visualize declarer with 5=2=1=5 or 5=2=0=6 distribution and all the missing high cards (for the opening bid).|PG||Sk||NT|^b@2
Any defense will suffice against 5=2=0=6, but if South is 5=2=1=5, East must shift to a diamond (preferably the ten, in case declarer's singleton is the nine) to prevent South from using the bulk of dummy's diamonds.|PC|dt|PG||NT|^b@2
If East instead leads a club or a spade, declarer has ten tricks: five spades, four diamonds and one club. |PG||up|9|pf|y|NT|^b@2

bt||qx|DD, Double Dummy Play Instructions|HT|b|cp|1|fp|1|at|^-
INSTRUCTIONS 
^-|ht|d|CP||fp||at|^C@2^z@3The movie follows the book's protocol. First, you see the North/South hands with the contract and the opening lead. You, sitting South, are asked to analyze the hand and plan a successful line of play.

Next, you will see the four hands where you can use the double dummy feature to test your line of play. When you are done, you can click the forward arrow and read the authors' solution. Finally, if you wish, you can again play the board double dummy or move on to the next problem.

What is ^*B"double dummy?"^*N  When you play ^*B"double dummy,"^*N you see all four handsï¿½itï¿½s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from each of the other hands. You will find you are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to 'take it.' Now, you may lead the next cardï¿½from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the folded trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the undo button in the Viewer to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the otherï¿½use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, ^*Bif you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.^*N|PG||
