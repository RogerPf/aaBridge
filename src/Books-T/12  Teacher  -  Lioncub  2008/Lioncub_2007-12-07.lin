^d @H@2Lioncub's bidding session is held every Friday in the BIL at noon NY time. 3 Hands @e@3are bid with 4 volunteers and then change. Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play…….or both. Feel free to ask any questions that are bridge related.

^d @e@2In this presentation we have combined the movie of the hands from lioncub's Friday @e@3Teaching Session with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed version of chat log transcript.  

The emphasis is presenting to you lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  We did not focus on correctness of the grammar or the spelling.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. Further, all the links in this file are clickable - it turns blue when you move your cursor over it.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site.

@D@D@D  Please note that with each board you will see the four hands and the auction after Allan has asked for a "Lead and Claim." The claim is meaningless and is made so the critique can begin.  Clicking the forward arrow will take you to the next board.  @D@D@D




Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

lioncub: Good lead. NEVER underlead ace in suit contract.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|

lioncub: With 4-card suits............bid up the line. BUT with touching 5-card suits bid the higher rank first which enables you to show the second suit at a lower level. Therefore, the bidding should have been. 1@D-1@S-2@H-2@S. Now you can bid 3@C  and partner can correct if need be to 3@D. Then S should say to himself I want to be in game and bid 4@H over 3@D.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


NT|
xfco: Is that not a reverse?|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: Nope. Not a reverse.......as partner can show preference to first bid suit.....without raising level of bidding. My bidding would be:
lioncub: 1@D-1@H
             2@C-4@H
To next board unless there are questions.|

lioncub: Big lesson on this hand............NEVER JUMP WITH JUST 3-CARD SUPPORT. This is how to do it. Make a waiting bid over 1@S such as  2@C here and bid 3@S after whatever partner next bid is. Likewise if you have 12-13 points and 3-card support. You make a waiting bid,,,,,,,,,and then bid 4@S.|

lioncub: super bidding by all,  especially S. Without the double South would show his second suit. BUT E has told him he has hearts for his double, so sensibly chose game in spades. E had perfect double.|

AT|
lioncub: Who is getting their fair share of points for doubling opponents?  I KNOW for a fact, you are missing out on a very lucrative part of the game. Look at this hand. Jimmy makes an overcall of 1NT and W has 10 points. He has no other bid to make other than double. N will probably run to spades. However that does not detract from what W first bid should be.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT|
lioncub: My bidding would be:
			1@H-1NT-X-2@S
Over 2@S E passes with min hand. W bids 3@h and 4@H by E closes the auction. They can make 11 tricks.|

lioncub: Usually it should be a good lead. In this hand it costs.|

lioncub: Another big tip for you all to note well.  NEVER USE STAYMAN WITH 4/3/3/3 HANDS. There is a sound reason for this. Stayman is used to find a 4/4 fit in a major. Here it would be no advantage. 4/4 spade fit will not enable W to use long trump to ruff anything. There are no doubletons.  OK?|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |

lioncub: 3rd big tip of the session is cue bid with 10+ and heart support over an over call.
1@H-2@C-? The bid here is the CUE BID as 1@h-2@c-3@c. With 10+ and heart support cue bid. AND S SHOULD NOW TRY AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR OPPONENTS......AND BID 5@C. My bidding:
	1@H-2@C-3@C-5@C
	  p-p-> ?
Now E has to guess...........that is the purpose of the bid.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |

spectre72: Wouldn't 3@h say the same thing?|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


AT|
 
lioncub: nooooooooooooooooooooo. That is the whole point of the cue bid. If you don't cue bid but bid hearts at any level it shows no more than 8/9 point maximum.  DIRECT RAISES ARE COMPETING ONLY.|

lioncub: 1@S correct opening bid....able to bid 2nd suit cheaply. And Bob nearly got it right by making waiting bid of 2@C. However over 2@H bob should then bid 4@S showing 12-15 points and 3-card support.|

MargoM: How about N bidding 2NT over opening bid to show opener over opener?|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |

lioncub: 2NT would again show 4-card support. The only way to show points with only 3-card support is by making a waiting bid first. 2@C was correct. 3@S was incorrect. Should have bid 4@S.|
