^d @H@2Lioncub's bidding session is held every Friday in the BIL at noon NY time. 3 Hands @e@3are bid with 4 volunteers and then change. Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play…….or both. Feel free to ask any questions that are bridge related.

^d @H@2What  :|CP||AT| For my later review I like to have a BBO movie representing lioncub's teaching session as close @e@3to the live event as possible. I am delighted that you can also enjoy it.|cp|8|at| 

How  :|CP||AT| In this presentation I have combined the hands from lioncub's Friday Teaching Sessions with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed and edited from the chat. He has approved the bridge information in this movie. You will see the four hands and the auction by the participants and after Allan has asked for a "Lead and Claim." The claim is meaningless and is made so his critique can begin. |cp|8|at| 

Goal :|CP||AT| The emphasis is to present lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  Incorrect grammar and spelling are tolerated. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. All the links in this file are clickable - they turn color when you move your cursor over them.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site. |FP|2|AT|

The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at|^*B HELP^*N |cp||FP|2|at|box at the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section. |FP||CP|8|AT|
 

Please help me improve these movies by sending suggestions to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.|CP||FP||AT|

                                               
                                              Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

^B@2lioncub: Best lead. well done.  W opens in 4th seat,,,,,,,,,,and tells a fib...........why? Because he was frightened his partner might pass 1@D.  In my view, IF PARTNER CANNOT BID OVER 1@D..............then no game will be missed. The bidding should be:
1@D-P-2@C-P

^B@2lioncub: There is no good lead. The 4@C as good as anything.  Bidding is correct.  I would not object to East bidding 1@H. There are only 5 points but does have a couple of 10s. Here is my input on minor openings:
1@D is always a 4-card suit except when exactly 4/4/3/2. This saves having to open 1@C with only a doubleton. Therefore, 90% of the time a 1@D opener will have at least 4 cards.|

^B@2lioncub: Good lead. Now we need to look carefully at this. What East could bid after 1@D opening?  Is the hand too strong to pass? The club suit is pretty anaemic and can't double as only doubleton spade. So the best bid available is 2@C. West after pass by South should bid 2@D which shows 10+ with club support. |

1@S-?   Well done South for passing first time. North correctly bids 2@C  wanting to compete, then 2@H from E. Now then S very timid to only bid 3@C  but what are the alternatives? After all said and done 3@C is the best bid which is the bid that makes. Well done South.|

^B@2lioncub: Correct lead. Now, we have  1@H-2@D ?
Very very very important to learn this thoroughly. Any direct raise.......be it 2@H, 3@H, or 4@H...........shows preemptive values with under 8 points. This of course is in competition. Completely different if there was no interference. In competitive bidding you show support and shape...........with a CUE BID. Thus, here it should be:
1@H-2@D-3@D  showing support with at least values to bid 3.  Therefore, when N hears 3@H from partner.........he should pass irrespective of vulnerability. Please learn this.........and get better results. lioncub: questions?|

^B@2irshgypsy: Don't understand the cue bid at all.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: Let me repeat it then. With this hand
lioncub: 1@H-2@D----------------------3@D. The 3@D is the cue bid........it is the enemy suit. It says nothing about the diamond suit.........either telling or asking. It is an artificial bid,,,,,,,,,,,,,,showing support for partner with at least 10 HCP. I repeat. A CUE BID IN OPPS SUIT...........PROMISES SUPPORT FOR PARTNER WITH AT LEAST 10 HCP.|

^B@2lioncub: Correct lead. 
Opening bid of 1@C WAS correct. On two counts I don't think the overcall by East is correct. Firstly only 4-card suit (1@D overcall shows a 5-crder) and secondly quality of suit is too poor. However, 1@S by South is correct. And I have a point for West. Partner has made a vulnerable overcall...........and you have 4-card support...........TELL HIM. Bearing in mind we show 10+ and support with a cue bid then make a direct raise. I would bid at least 3@D.  4@D would also not be wrong........bid high and make opps guess. Over the double, however, N has 3-card support either pass or bid 2@S.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |

^B@2All players............here you must look at the vulnerability. One off doubled is 200...............more than the value of a part score. Correct bidding:

^B@2With this hand it is debateable whether to use puppet or not. 3NT is a reasonable alternative over 2NT..........as hand is so flat. Why not regular stayman? Because very often the hand contains a 5-card major. See my site at ^*Hwww.zyworld.com/lioncub/Puppet_Stayman.htm^*N.|
