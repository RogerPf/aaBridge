^d @H@2Lioncub's bidding session is held every Friday in the BIL at noon NY time. 3 Hands @e@3are bid with 4 volunteers and then change. Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play…….or both. Feel free to ask any questions that are bridge related.

^d @e@2In this presentation we have combined the movie of the hands from lioncub's Friday @e@3Teaching Session with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed version of chat log transcript.  

The emphasis is presenting to you lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  We did not focus on correctness of the grammar or the spelling.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. Further, all the links in this file are clickable - it turns blue when you move your cursor over it.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site.

@D@D@D  Please note that with each board you will see the four hands and the auction after Allan has asked for a "Lead and Claim." The claim is meaningless and is made so the critique can begin.  Clicking the forward arrow will take you to the next board.  @D@D@D




Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

lioncub: Lead is correct. |

lioncub: First let us all sit in E seat. Open 1NT and show no 4-card major in response to stayman. So what does 2@H now show? It shows a weak hand with 5 hearts and 4 spades............and signs off in 2@H willing to play this in a possible 5-2 fit. Smolen is only used with game forcing hand.....forget it............never on this hand. So what went wrong? Let us have another look at W hand and decide.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


NT|
lioncub: THIS IS THE RULE............ONLY USE STAYMAN IF LOOKING FOR A 4/4 FIT IN ONE OF THE MAJORS. Of course still use it with 4/5......hoping to find fit in the 4-card suit. So how do you show 5-card suit?   NEVER use stayman.........use transfer sequence. |
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


NT|
Bidding should be:
              1NT-2@D
              2@H-2NT
That bidding shows an invitational hand with 5-card heart suit. Opener can pass........or sign off in 3@H with min hand and 3 hearts...........or bid 3NT with max and 2 hearts.........or bid 4@H with max and 3 hearts. This is a very instructive hand.........please be clear on my explanation. Questions?|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |

lioncub: I hope all understand now when to use stayman?|

lioncub: Lead is OK.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: Now before I go through this..........let me state what should be a golden rule. If your partner bids a suit in which you have a singleton ......BACKTRACK LIKE CRAZY.  1@C-1@H-?  South you cannot bid 1@S which guarantees a 5-card suit.  THE BID IS DOUBLE.........NEGATIVE.........guaranteeing a 4-card spade suit and tolerance for other suit.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT|
lioncub: However after 1@S bid..............W is correct to pass. And of course N should NOT bid 1NT ..........either pass . . . . my choice........or bid 2@C. Now having bid 1NT........should E bid again?|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT|
lioncub: first of all............look at the vulnerability.............one off doubled is 200 worth more than any part score. E should THINK. Partner heard you say 1@H.........and said nothing.  Odds are heavily against bidding again. BUT........having bid 2@D....................S now should crack the whip and double. He should know W has under 3 hearts as he passed. But again ....having passed.......next up is W.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


NT|
lioncub: RULE IS THIS...........TAKE PARTNER BACK TO FIRST BID SUIT....UNLESS YOU HAVE 2 OR MORE CARDS IN  THE SECOND SUIT THAN YOU DO IN THE FIRST.  So with 3 diamonds and 2 hearts................W should STILL bid 2@H. Here the preference is clear cut........bid 2@H.
lioncub: My bidding
         1@C-1@H x-P
         2@C-p-p-p
lioncub: questions? If not it is time to change.|

lioncub: Here we are playing Bergen Raises. Hope you all know Bergen........or have notes to refer to. If not look it up on my website at ^*Hwww.zyworld.com/lioncub ^*N and take notes. In bergen you bid 3@S now. 3@S bid will buy the contract. S cannot come in nor can N. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


AT|

In Bergen Raises with 4-card support you bid 3@C with 6-9, 3@D with 7-11 total points.|

lioncub: I prefer unbid major.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: 1@S-3@C.  3@c IS boderline ........top end of range. Now to E.  Let us do a hand evaluation. Don't count the Q and we have 12HCP + 3 points for distribution for the singleton = 15. It must be worth an invitation with a bid of 3@D. Note this still does not commit partnership to game.  W should recognize he is top end of range and has a 5th card in the suit and remembers that ACES ARE GOLD AND KINGS ARE SILVER...in helping to evaluate hand and should bid 4@S. This is super hand to learn from. Questions?|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|
nome: Would it be unreasonable for W to bid 4@S on first round?|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: Yes it would. W needs singletons and could do so with less points. Bergen response of 3@C or describes the hand well enough.|

foxylives: Why was @dA right in this case rather than the unbid major?|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |

lioncub: Had small doubleton and I hate doubleton leads unless nothing better is available. @DA is the best available.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT|
lioncub: this bidding sequence
lioncub: the 3@C bid is A HELP SUIT GAME TRY...........showing 3 losers in the suit.......it says to partner if you can help me take care of these losers.....bid game. It does NOT show a second suit......as is the case here.
 lioncub: My bidding is: 
          1@S-2S|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT|
Playing Bergen Raises, South now knows that there is only 3-card support. However, the fit is found. He should revalue hand. He would have 16 total points after adding 3 points for singleton and 1 for doubleton to his 12 HCPs. Now, bids 3@S to find out whether partner is min or max. N obliges with 4@S.
lioncub: Questions? |

lioncub: Bidding fine to start with.  Should S bid again? I think so. South has a GOOD  8 points with sound suit should bid 2NT. With 9 points you ALWAYS invite, with poor 8 pass and with GOOD 8 invite. The quality of the suit is important.|

lioncub: No. The correct lead is the ace clubs then switch to the spade.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: Super bid by S. Hoping to play in 2@H more chance of tricks than in 1NT. Now again correctly W bids 2@S. But, North?  There is just one bid to make.......and one bid only............do NOT ever consider anything else and that is pass. By passing he tells partner he has only a doubleton heart. Partner has unknown strength. Let her take any further action if she wants to. |
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


AT|   toniwascok: y, I see.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT|
lioncub: And E? Partner is vulnerable......and has bid against unknown strength..........therefore must be strong.
Learn to double with these hands............will show a profit.........I promise you.

lioncub: questions? If none, then let's change........for the next hands.|

My preferred bid with the E hand...........is to open 2NT. But still should end in 4@S by use of transfer by W. Singleton honor is acceptable for 2NT opener...........it shows the point count.|
