^*BSolution :^*N After winning the heart ace—there is no point to a hold-up-declarer should realize that the defense can take six tricks if they are allowed in at once with the ace of trumps. Before touching trumps, declarer must, therefore, take the club finesse to develop a discard for a red-suit loser, even though such play risks a two-trick set.|

pf||NT|^B@2
^*BSolution :^*N Declarer needs no heart trick for his contract, but he needs a heart stopper to prevent the defense from forcing the strong trumps out of the closed hand. If declarer ducks the first trick, the defense is helpless. If West leads another heart——which is as good a play as any——that lead establishes a heart trick in dummy. The South hand can be forced only twice. The contract is secure, even against a 4-1 trump break.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|West's @HQ lead is probably from @HQ J. So if West leads a low heart and trick 2, South can play the @H10, forcing out the HA and setting up the @HK as a stopper. If West leads the @HJ (not recommended) South covers with the @HK, forcing out the @HA and setting up the @H10 as a stopper.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If declarer covers with the king of hearts at trick one, he seals his own doom. East wins and returns a heart, which South must ruff. East wins the first spade with the king, and returns another heart, which South must ruff again. Now, when West gets in with the ace of spades, West can lead yet another heart, establishing his spade eight as the setting trick. Next let us reload the hand and try it ^*BD^*Nouble ^*BD^*Nummy again. |

^*BSolution^*N: West leads the @SQ, you play @S2 from the dummy, and East playing the ten. Now what? Even if the diamond suit can be brought in, South is in danger of losing two spade tricks. If trumps are 2-2, all is well. But if trumps are 3-l, he must ruff a spade in the closed hand after taking a discard in clubs. This play will succeed if one defender (almost certainly East) holds three diamonds and four clubs.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT|^B@2
To give himself the best opportunity to overcome a 3-1 trump split, South should duck the first spade. Upon winning the spade return he can take two rounds of trumps, then play on clubs (discarding a spade), ruff a spade, and finally return to dummy to draw the remaining trump.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If South wins the first spade, he must give up a spade trick before ruffing a spade. If he has drawn two rounds of trumps, East will win the spade and lead a third round, killing the ruff. Attempting to circumvent this by drawing only one trump will lose the contract if West, with queen doubleton of diamonds and two clubs, has the acumen to put up the queen of diamonds on the first trump lead not a difficult play. We reload the board so you an play it double dummy with those instructions.|

 If the spades come in, there is no problem. If not, declarer must plan to discard his losing diamond on the fourth round of clubs. But the defenders may get to their diamond trick first.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT|^B@2
To minimize this danger, declarer should plan to refuse the club finesse. Taking the club finesse will lose the contract if East holds the queen of clubs and the defender with the long trump holds fewer than three clubs. If, however, declarer plays ace, king, and another club (before the ace of diamonds is removed) he is assured a chance to discard on the fourth club.|
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This line of play will insure the contract if clubs are four-two or better, or the club queen is singleton (unless West holds all five trumps). But it can be improved still further. Declarer should take the ace of hearts and lead a club to the ace at once. Then he draws three rounds of trumps and leads a second club. |

Two famous internationalists teach you how to analyze and play out the difficult hands that separate the neophytes from the prize winners.

^*BPAUL LUKACS^*N (1915-1982) was a renowned problem constructor and analyst, who represented Israel in international play. His most lasting contribution to bridge literature was as co-author of "Spotlight on Card Play" (with Robert Darvas), the first post-war problem collection to highlight expert thought processes.

^*BJEFF RUBENS^*N (b. 1941), a former mathematics professor, has been co—editor and then editor of the world's most prestigious bridge magazine, "The Bridge World," since 1967. His best known book is the classic "Secrets of Winning Bridge."|

To study in movie format Louis H. Watson’s CLASSIC BOOK ON PLAY OF THE HAND AT BRIDGE, click this |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/ftmhdx^*N|CP||AT| link or get it from BIL library at |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bilbridge.com^*N|CP||AT|. 

The boards presented show the North/South hands, the contract, and opening lead on one page; followed by the authors’ analysis on the next. The format, therefore, allows the viewer to plan the play of the contract before reading the authors’ analysis and explanation of the correct line of play. Please note all blue text is hyperlink.

To adapt the text of the book to work within the movie format, we have made minor changes to the content of the solutions. The purpose remains to consider the various distributions of the suits and plan the play in a certain order to ensure the contract.

|fp|2|at|^-by Paul Lukacs and Jeff Rubens
^-}|CS||FP||CP||ht|f|at|^B@2This book is a collection of problems in declarer play. These are not double—dummy problems. The solution in each case requires logical thought and the correct application of a sound principle of card play.

The reader can improve his techniques in declarer play by examining each situation carefully. After the reader has made his decision, the solution will tell him whether or not he arrived at the correct method of play. The solution will also explain the basic principle involved.

The bidding is significant only in those situations in which the East/West bidding--or the lack of it--must be considered.

The only conventions used are (1) Stayman and (2) an artificial two-club opening which shows a strong hand, not necessarily in clubs. Here, a negative two—diamond response will indicate a very weak hand, not necessarily relating to diamonds.

Although the reader may want to review the North/South bidding, it is not necessary to thoroughly understand the bidding in order to attack the playing problem. And it is certainly unnecessary to approve the bidding, since some of the bidding is poor. We all get to inferior contracts now and then, and any practical manual of play must include poor contracts as well as good ones.

The solution to each problem is found directly on the page after the presentation. These are not easy problems; quite the contrary, some of them are admittedly difficult.

%%%%%% Double Dummy
qx|DD, Double Dummy Play Instructions|HT|b|cp|1|fp|1|at|^-
INSTRUCTIONS 
^-|ht|d|CP||fp||at|^C@2^z@3The movie follows the book's protocol. First, you see the North/South hands with the contract and the opening lead. You, sitting South, are asked to analyze the hand and plan a successful line of play.

Next, you will see the four hands where you can use the double dummy feature to test your line of play. When you are done, you can click the forward arrow and read the authors' solution. Finally, if you wish, you can again play the board double dummy or move on to the next problem.

What is ^*B"double dummy?"^*N  When you play ^*B"double dummy,"^*N you see all four hands—it’s great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from each of the other hands. You will find you are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to 'take it.' Now, you may lead the next card—from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the folded trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the undo button in the Viewer to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other—use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, ^*Bif you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.^*N|
