With spade king lead, please plan the play to make the 3N contract.  South seems to have nine easy tricks but there is a fly in the ointment:  the club suit is blocked.  The block will not prevent running the suit if the opponents' clubs are split 2-1.|

NT|^B@2
As we said, the club suit is blocked. The block will not prevent running the suit if the opponents' clubs are split 2-1. In that case, declarer can win the first two club tricks with the king and queen, exhausting the East/West clubs, then win the third trick in clubs with the nine, and finally overtake the eight with the ace. However, a 3-0 club split will doom this plan, and declarer should take measures to guard against this possibility.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The simplest way to overcome the problem is to discard one of South's clubs. This can be accomplished only through one suit, spades, so South should duck the opening lead. If West leads another spade, declarer ducks again and can now take nine tricks by playing king @- queen-ace of clubs and throwing his last club on the spade ace. If West shifts, declarer wins and ducks another spade himself, achieving the same position. Let us reload the hand so you can play it ^*BD^*Nouble ^*BD^*Nummy.|

Now comes the hard part. As you can see the @SJ 10 9 7 6 are outstanding. Declarer should have no problem making an over-trick if they are 3-2. However, the contract will fail if they are 4-1. Therefore, plan to make it with 4-1 split in mind. The next play is the critical one. |

Declarer should play one round of spades starting with @S4 and play low from his own hand. The critical play is giving one trump trick to the opponents. The defenders can win this trick, but declarer will take the rest (barring a 5-0 break in a black suit). A further heart lead can be ruffed in dummy.|pc|s4s6s2st|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This play gives up an over trick when trumps break 3-2, but preserves the contract when trumps break 4-1. If declarer tries to draw trumps by leading high ones, a 4-1 trump break defeats him. If South tries to ruff two hearts and throw another on a club, he may be frustrated by a 4-1 club break. The immediate duck in spades avoids all these dangers. The rest is easy.|

It may be a freak board but you are declaring 7N with @S10 as the opening lead. Plan your play. This contract looks easy, but is actually tricky. The critical fact is that the club and diamond suits have different properties. Declarer is sure to pick up the club suit even if one opponent has all four missing clubs--if he leads the king or queen first, But in diamonds, if the suit is 4-0 declarer must guess how to play the suit--king or queen first if he judges East may have all four; ace first, if he judges West may hold all four.|

^*BSolution^*N: Declarer should reserve his decision in diamonds as long as possible to get information to help him resolve this guess. After playing clubs and discovering West has all four, it cannot hurt him to play off his major suit winners. Let us handle the opening lead and then test the clubs.|

When a contract seems secure, declarer should think what might possibly go wrong. Even though trumps are 3-1, there will be no problem if a high heart is not ruffed, since dummy's ruffing trump is a high one. When declarer draws a second round of trumps and discovers that East holds the missing trump, he should play to neutralize the effect of the ruff of a high heart.|pc|SA|pc|h2|

^*BSolution^*N: It would be poor strategy for declarer to try for hearts, because even if he could set up two heart tricks he would still need the club finesse to make his contract. Instead, declarer should depend on the club finesse. But he must be careful. First declarer must play the @SJ from hand and @SA from the dummy|

From dummy to lead the three would make it impossible to repeat the finesse. To lead the jack would squeeze the South hand in clubs if East, properly, ducked. If South plays the five, he must win the next club in his hand; if South plays the ten, East has a fourth-round stopper.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The correct play is to lead the club nine from dummy, underplaying with the five if East ducks. Then lead the jack from dummy, underplaying with the ten. However, East defends, declarer makes four club tricks and his contract.|pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|c2|

There are two main chances for the contract: a 3-3 club split, and a spade finesse. If the spades are tried first, the only extra chance would be an unlikely black-suit squeeze. But if the clubs are tried first, declarer has an extra chance. Let us try clubs first. Please watch all the cards carefully. You will get the needed clue soon.|

Great pick up South. As you played clubs and West shows with four clubs as East showed out. Now you can lead a fourth round from dummy, discarding a losing spade.|

If West wins this trick, he is endplayed: he must either lead into the spade A-Q, or concede a ruff-and sluff.|

Two famous internationalists teach you how to analyze and play out the difficult hands that separate the neophytes from the prize winners.

^*BPAUL LUKACS^*N (1915-1982) was a renowned problem constructor and analyst, who represented Israel in international play. His most lasting contribution to bridge literature was as co-author of "Spotlight on Card Play" (with Robert Darvas), the first post-war problem collection to highlight expert thought processes.

^*BJEFF RUBENS^*N (b. 1941), a former mathematics professor, has been co-editor and then editor of the world's most prestigious bridge magazine, "The Bridge World," since 1967. His best known book is the classic "Secrets of Winning Bridge."

|fp|2|at|^-by Paul Lukacs and Jeff Rubens
^-}|CS||FP||CP||ht|f|at|^B@2TEST YOUR PLAY is considered an excellent workbook for improving your declarer play and is on the same level of difficulty as that of Watson.  To study in movie format Louis H. Watson's CLASSIC BOOK ON PLAY OF THE HAND AT BRIDGE, click this |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/ftmhdx^*N|CP||AT| link or get it from BIL library at |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bilbridge.com^*N|CP||AT|.

From both volumes, each week we present a few boards. The boards presented show the North/South hands, the contract, and opening lead on one page; followed by the authors' analysis on the next. The format, therefore, allows the viewer to plan the play of the contract before reading the authors' analysis and explanation of the correct line of play. Should the viewer then wish to play the boards ‘hands on' in ^*BD^*Nouble ^*BD^*Nummy @- highly recommended for effectual study, instructions are provided |CP|1|at|^*GDD, here^*N|CP||AT|. Please note all blue text is hyperlink.

To adapt the text of the book to work within the movie format, I have made minor changes to the content of the solutions. The purpose remains to consider the various distributions of the suits and plan the play in a certain order to ensure the contract.

|fp|2|at|^-by Paul Lukacs and Jeff Rubens
^-}|CS||FP||CP||ht|f|at|^B@2This book is a collection of problems in declarer play. These are not double dummy problems. The solution in each case requires logical thought and the correct application of a sound principle of card play.

The reader can improve his techniques in declarer play by examining each situation carefully. After the reader has made his decision, the solution will tell him whether or not he arrived at the correct method of play. The solution will also explain the basic principle involved.

The bidding is significant only in those situations in which the East/West bidding @- or the lack of it @- must be considered.

The only conventions used are (1) Stayman and (2) an artificial two-club opening which shows a strong hand, not necessarily in clubs. Here, a negative two diamond response will indicate a very weak hand, not necessarily relating to diamonds.

Although the reader may want to review the North/South bidding, it is not necessary to thoroughly understand the bidding in order to attack the playing problem. And it is certainly unnecessary to approve the bidding, since some of the bidding is poor. We all get to inferior contracts now and then, and any practical manual of play must include poor contracts as well as good ones.

The solution to each problem is found directly on the page after the presentation. These are not easy problems; quite the contrary, some of them are admittedly difficult.

INSTRUCTIONS 
^-|ht|d|CP||fp||at|^C@2^z@3The movie follows the book's protocol. First, you see the North/South hands with the contract and the opening lead. You, sitting South, are asked to analyze the hand and plan a successful line of play.

Next, you will see the four hands where you can use the ^*BD^*Nouble ^*BD^*Nummy feature to test your line of play. When you are done, you can click the forward arrow and read the authors' solution. Finally, if you wish, you can again play the board ^*BD^*Nouble ^*BD^*Nummy or move on to the next problem.

What is ^*B"double dummy?"^*N  When you play ^*B"double dummy,"^*N you see all four hands @- it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from each of the other hands. You will find you are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to 'take it.' Now, you may lead the next card @- from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the folded trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the undo button in the Viewer to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other @- use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing ^*BD^*Nouble ^*BD^*Nummy, ^*Bif you click the forward arrow, it cancels the ^*BD^*Nouble ^*BD^*Nummy feature.^*N
