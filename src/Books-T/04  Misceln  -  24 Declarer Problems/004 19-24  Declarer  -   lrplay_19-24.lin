NT|^B@2
To determine whether to attack diamonds or spades, declarer should first lead clubs. If clubs split 3-3, South can make certain of his contract by driving out the ace of spades. If clubs are not favorably split, South will need four diamond tricks and can attack that suit.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |

In order to provide for the contingency that he will need to attack diamonds, South should cash the ace of diamonds at trick two.|
PC|DAd8d3d9|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


sk||NT|^b@2
This is a safety play that gives him the maximum chance to get four diamond tricks. It is essential to make this play at once, because there may be no further chance to reenter dummy after clubs are tested. Cashing the ace of diamonds at trick two reduces South's chances of making five diamond tricks, but five diamond tricks will never be essential to the contract.|

^*BSolution^*N: If the club honors do not drop doubleton, South's best chance is to find one minor split 3-3 and the other 4-2 or worse. He can then eliminate spades, draw trumps, play two rounds of one minor and three rounds of the other, hoping that the defender who wins the trick has to give him a ruff and discard. Clubs is the superior throw-in suit (because the defense is less likely to be able to unblock), so declarer should hope for unbalanced diamonds. |pc|sa|

Declarer must be careful, however, to win the first spade. He has nothing to lose by this -- after drawing three trumps he plays back spades and proceeds as before. If the first spade is ducked, East may shift to a diamond. Declarer must now guess whether East holds one diamond or two.|

PG| ***** 34 ***** |


sk||NT|^b@2
If clubs split 5-2, declarer gives up on clubs, draws trumps, and ducks a diamond. This will bring in the contract if diamonds are 2-2 or if a squeeze can be developed. The trap to avoid is ruffing a club before cashing the second honor in dummy.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT|^b@2
This gains only if clubs break 6-1 (and then probably only if West has the singleton) and loses in a fairly normal distribution of the cards such as the one shown. By playing correctly, declarer sees the club break in time to give up on clubs and play diamonds. If the key play is not made, and a second club is ruffed, declarer loses control and cannot take advantage of the 2-2 diamond break.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT|^b@2
If clubs split 4-3, declarer ruffs a spade, ruffs a club, and claims his slam, using the ace of diamonds as entry to the long club.|

Furthermore, if West holds @H10 9 x (as in the this hand), he still cannot escape the endÂ·play, even if he unblocks on the first round. And, of course, there are many Wests who would fail to unblock from an original holding of @H10 x x. Finally, there is always the club finesse if all else fails.|

Two famous internationalists teach you how to analyze and play out the difficult hands that separate the neophytes from the prize winners.

^*BPAUL LUKACS^*N (1915-1982) was a renowned problem constructor and analyst, who represented Israel in international play. His most lasting contribution to bridge literature was as co-author of "Spotlight on Card Play" (with Robert Darvas), the first post-war problem collection to highlight expert thought processes.

^*BJEFF RUBENS^*N (b. 1941), a former mathematics professor, has been co-editor and then editor of the world's most prestigious bridge magazine, "The Bridge World," since 1967. His best known book is the classic "Secrets of Winning Bridge."|

^-}|CS||FP||CP||ht|f|at|^B@2TEST YOUR PLAY is considered an excellent workbook for improving your declarer play and is on the same level of difficulty as that of Watson.  To study in movie format Louis H. Watson's CLASSIC BOOK ON PLAY OF THE HAND AT BRIDGE, click this |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/ftmhdx^*N|CP||AT| link or get it from BIL library at |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bilbridge.com^*N|CP||AT|. 

The boards presented show the North/South hands, the contract, and opening lead on one page; followed by the authors' analysis on the next. The format, therefore, allows the viewer to plan the play of the contract before reading the authors' analysis and explanation of the correct line of play. Please note all blue text is hyperlink.

To adapt the text of the book to work within the movie format, we have made minor changes to the content of the solutions. The purpose remains to consider the various distributions of the suits and plan the play in a certain order to ensure the contract.

|fp|2|at|^-by Paul Lukacs and Jeff Rubens
^-}|CS||FP||CP||ht|f|at|^B@2This book is a collection of problems in declarer play. These are not double-dummy problems. The solution in each case requires logical thought and the correct application of a sound principle of card play.

The reader can improve his techniques in declarer play by examining each situation carefully. After the reader has made his decision, the solution will tell him whether or not he arrived at the correct method of play. The solution will also explain the basic principle involved.

The bidding is significant only in those situations in which the East/West bidding @- or the lack of it @- must be considered.

The only conventions used are (1) Stayman and (2) an artificial two-club opening which shows a strong hand, not necessarily in clubs. Here, a negative two diamond response will indicate a very weak hand, not necessarily relating to diamonds.

Although the reader may want to review the North/South bidding, it is not necessary to thoroughly understand the bidding in order to attack the playing problem. And it is certainly unnecessary to approve the bidding, since some of the bidding is poor. We all get to inferior contracts now and then, and any practical manual of play must include poor contracts as well as good ones.

The solution to each problem is found directly on the page after the presentation. These are not easy problems; quite the contrary, some of them are admittedly difficult.
