^*BSolution:^*N Even though South is certain to pick up the club suit (West can hardly have four clubs), he needs a spade trick to score game. Thus, the spade ace must be dislodged before trumps are drawn.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If declarer knocks out the ace of spades before drawing trumps, the only danger to the contract is a club ruff. If either opponent is void of clubs it is surely West (who started with four hearts, presumably four or more spades, and at least two diamonds). Therefore South should play the six of hearts, win as cheaply as possible in dummy, and lead spades through East.|pc|h6h8hjd9|

the contract is still safe because declarer now has two spade tricks. If South is allowed to win the king of spades he can draw the last trump and proceed to tackle clubs. And if West holds the ace of spades, there is no danger to the contract in any event. Next you can play it Double Dummy.|sk||

Therefore, declarer should plan to succeed whenever possible if diamonds break 4-2. In this event two ruffs will be required to establish a long diamond in dummy and a spade ruff is also necessary (for the thirteenth trick). |MD|0,SJ97HJ98DQJ76C98,0,SQT843HT6DT4CQJ42|

As a safety play, declarer should cash the king and ace of hearts before attacking diamonds. This will avoid an overruff if West holds doubletons in both red suits, and an uppercut if (as in the diagram) East holds two doubletons. This line also succeeds if East has three hearts and two diamonds.|

With the spade winners blocked, there is now the danger of being blocked out of the South hand if diamonds split badly. If, for example, the cards are distributed as shown in the diagram,|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |

South will be badly placed if he cashes the ace and queen of diamonds immediately.|

^*BSolution^*N: If spades do not split 3â3, declarer will require a spade ruff in dummy for his tenth trick. Although the unfavorable trump lead puts the defense one step ahead in the race, declarer should play spades at once in the hope the defender with four spades has only two trumps (and thus cannot play a third round of trumps when he wins the third round of spades).|MD|0,SKQ98H865DQ92CQ7,0,SJ3HDJ8754CKJT43|

Assuming diamonds are not divided 4-0, South can make certain of his contract by leading a diamond to the jack.|pc|d3d6djdq|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT|^b@2
If either opponent wins the queen, declarer takes the rest easily. If the jack of diamonds holds, declarer returns to his king of diamonds and leads a low club, forcing entry to dummy in clubs. In any event, declarer will take 12 tricks.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Leading the king of diamonds first is likely to prove superior only if West holds all four missing diamonds. However, the chances of making the contract in that situation are not bright, even if South starts with the king of diamonds. Playing to the jack of diamonds guards against the much more likely possibility that an opponent holds three diamonds to the queen.|

^*BSolution^*N: South must decide whether to begin his red suits with diamonds or hearts. By starting hearts, South wins if one of two finesses in hearts succeeds or if either opponent holds the singleton king of diamonds.|MD|0,S43HKJ3DJ632C765,0,S7652H6542DK5C432|sk||
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Starting diamonds also gives declarer the chance to win one of two finesses, but with an important difference. If the first diamond play is from dummy, South can finesse against either the king or jack of diamonds in the East hand. Assuming the finesse loses, declarer can then try to drop the remaining diamond honor doubleton before reverting to the heart finesse. |
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Since a particular diamond honor singleton or doubleton is a better chance than the king singleton, starting diamonds from dummy gives declarer a better chance than starting hearts. There is also the additional chance that East will go up with the king of diamonds if he has it (so declarer should probably finesse against the jack of diamonds when he leads from dummy).|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Note that it would be wrong to lead diamonds first from the South hand, for a losing diamond finesse and a heart return will force declarer to commit himself prematurely.|

Two famous internationalists teach you how to analyze and play out the difficult hands that separate the neophytes from the prize winners.

^*BPAUL LUKACS^*N (1915-1982) was a renowned problem constructor and analyst, who represented Israel in international play. His most lasting contribution to bridge literature was as co-author of "Spotlight on Card Play" (with Robert Darvas), the first post-war problem collection to highlight expert thought processes.

^*BJEFF RUBENS^*N (b. 1941), a former mathematics professor, has been coâeditor and then editor of the world's most prestigious bridge magazine, "The Bridge World," since 1967. His best known book is the classic "Secrets of Winning Bridge."|

^-}|CS||FP||CP||ht|f|at|^B@2TEST YOUR PLAY is considered an excellent workbook for improving your declarer play and is on the same level of difficulty as that of Watson.  To study in movie format Louis H. Watsonâs CLASSIC BOOK ON PLAY OF THE HAND AT BRIDGE, click this |CP|1|AT|^*Htiny.cc/ftmhdx^*N|CP||AT| link or get it from BIL library at |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bilbridge.com^*N|CP||AT|. 

The boards presented show the North/South hands, the contract, and opening lead on one page; followed by the authorsâ analysis on the next. The format, therefore, allows the viewer to plan the play of the contract before reading the authorsâ analysis and explanation of the correct line of play. Please note all blue text is hyperlink.

To adapt the text of the book to work within the movie format, we have made minor changes to the content of the solutions. The purpose remains to consider the various distributions of the suits and plan the play in a certain order to ensure the contract.

|fp|2|at|^-by Paul Lukacs and Jeff Rubens
^-}|CS||FP||CP||ht|f|at|^B@2This book is a collection of problems in declarer play. These are not doubleâdummy problems. The solution in each case requires logical thought and the correct application of a sound principle of card play.

The reader can improve his techniques in declarer play by examining each situation carefully. After the reader has made his decision, the solution will tell him whether or not he arrived at the correct method of play. The solution will also explain the basic principle involved.

The bidding is significant only in those situations in which the East/West bidding--or the lack of it--must be considered.

The only conventions used are (1) Stayman and (2) an artificial two-club opening which shows a strong hand, not necessarily in clubs. Here, a negative twoâdiamond response will indicate a very weak hand, not necessarily relating to diamonds.

Although the reader may want to review the North/South bidding, it is not necessary to thoroughly understand the bidding in order to attack the playing problem. And it is certainly unnecessary to approve the bidding, since some of the bidding is poor. We all get to inferior contracts now and then, and any practical manual of play must include poor contracts as well as good ones.

The solution to each problem is found directly on the page after the presentation. These are not easy problems; quite the contrary, some of them are admittedly difficult.

INSTRUCTIONS 
^-|ht|d|CP||fp||at|^C@2^z@3The movie follows the book's protocol. First, you see the North/South hands with the contract and the opening lead. You, sitting South, are asked to analyze the hand and plan a successful line of play.

Next, you will see the four hands where you can use the double dummy feature to test your line of play. When you are done, you can click the forward arrow and read the authors' solution. Finally, if you wish, you can again play the board double dummy or move on to the next problem.

What is ^*B"double dummy?"^*N  When you play ^*B"double dummy,"^*N you see all four handsâitâs great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from each of the other hands. You will find you are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to 'take it.' Now, you may lead the next cardâfrom the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the folded trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the undo button in the Viewer to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the otherâuse the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, ^*Bif you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.^*N|
