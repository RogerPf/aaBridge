@hs will provide the one needed trick.

Don't waste the @sA early. You need it to reach dummy after the @h trick is established.

nt|This is an easy hand in IMP-scoring. You can guarantee 9 tricks with 100%.
But in MP-scoring you should probably try for overtricks by finessing the@dQ. 
On the other hand, if the @dQ is onside you should have bid slam and you should play on the assumption that your bidding was right.".
Very difficult decision indeed|

To establish the @ds you'll loose the lead twice for sure and defenders will establish their @s-suit.
You'll loose at least 2@ss + 1@h + 2@ds = 5 tricks for one down. So you cannot win playing on @ds.|sb|s|

There is no danger in holding up the first @s. After winning the @s trick we have another entry to the table in @dJ, so we should play small @h to the @hK first just in case the @hQ is stiff. Then we can test @ds, go back to the table in @dJ and finesse the @HJ.|

^d@21) Count your sure tricks in high cards.
2) Calculate how many additional tricks are needed to make your bid.
3) Decide from which suit these tricks may come from.
4) Be aware what can damage your plan.
^e@24.1 Have opponents a long suit to run before you run your tricks??
4.2 Is there a dangerous opponent?
