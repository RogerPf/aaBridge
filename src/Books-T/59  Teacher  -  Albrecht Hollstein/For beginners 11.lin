The play of a suit contract is in general much more complicated than to play a NT-contract. 
To get a better idea you might look up this page:

{^c@2In suit contract we count primarily the number of losers in the master-hand, not the sure tricks. ^z}

{^c@2In this lesson we are concerned with 2 problems:

^c1. How to determine the master-hand. Use these criteria, in order of importance:

    @21.1 The trump length: choose the hand with longer trumps. 
^d   Rare exceptions are the subject of the advanced lessons. 

1.2 The trump quality: choose the hand with better trumps.
^d  This enables you to ruff your losers with small trumps, preventing trump promotion for defenders.

1.3 The number of losers: choose the hand with fewer losers.

1.4 How easy these losers are to avoid: choose the hand which losers are easier to be avoided.

^c2. How to manage to draw exactly as many rounds of trumps as necessary. ^z}

^d1. Which hand is the "master-hand"?
^d2. How many losers do I have?

nt|Before we start to count the losers we must determine which hand is the master-hand. These are the criteria for that decision:
1. The trump length. ^fSouth: |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


hc|sK763|at| 4.
^fNorth: |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


lc|sK763|hc|sA542|at| 4, the same.|

2. The trump quality. ^fSouth: |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


hc|sK763|at| Hxxx (one honour and 3 small). 
^fNorth: |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


lc|sK763|hc|sA542|at| Hxxx, the same.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


lc|sA542|at|
If North had @sAKQ2 and South had @S8743, it would be best to use North as the master-hand for the loser count. This is especially true if you consider to ruff losers in dummy (the Plan 1). You would not want to ruff using your big trumps since this could promote a trump trick for the defenders.|ls|nsss|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |

4. How easy these losers can be avoided. 
South: |hc|s3h2c754|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


at| The @h can be ruffed in dummy.|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


at| The 3rd @c loser maybe avoided only if the suit is distributed 3-3, because you must be afraid of an overruff else.|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


at|
North: |lc|s3h2c754|hc|s2d78c36|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


at| The black losers are inevitable, but the 2 @ds can be ruffed in declarer's hand.|

^-{So we take North's hand as the master-hand, because the losers are easier to avoid.

pg| ***** 60 ***** |


nt|Let's repeat the procedure of determining the master-hand and counting losers.
1. The trump length. ^fSouth: |
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


hc|sA643|at| 4.
^fNorth: |
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


lc|sA643|hc|s9752|at| 4, the same.|

2. The trump quality. ^fSouth: |

hc|sA643|at| Hxxx (one honour and 3 small). 
^fNorth: |
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


lc|sA643|hc|s9752|at| xxxx, slightly weaker.|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


lc|s9752|nt|3. The number of losers. ^gSouth: |
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


at| 2 @ss (hoping for a 3-2 distribution) +|hc|s43|
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


at| 1 @h +|hc|h2|
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


at| 2 @cs = 5.|hc|c65|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


lc|s43h2c65|at|
^gNorth: |
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


at| 2 @ss (hoping for a 3-2 distribution) +|hc|s52|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


at| 3 @hs = 5, the same.|hc|h654|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


lc|s52h654|at|
4. How How easy these losers can be avoided. 
South: |hc|s43h2c65|
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


at| Inevitable losers are two @ss and one @h. Two @c losers can be ruffed in dummy, without giving the lead.|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


at|
North: |lc|s43h2c65|hc|s52h654|
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


at| Inevitable losers are two @ss and one @h. Two @h losers can be ruffed in South's hand giving the lead once.|
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


lc|s52h654|at|

In this case the South hand has both slightly better trumps and easier to avoid losers, so it is the master-hand.|
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


nt|The Plan 1 (ruffing losers in the short hand) appears right away as the best plan. 
Before making ruffs, what do we usually do to prevent overruffs?|
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


sb|sWe try to remove as many trumps as possible. I will try 1 round.|
%% 1st try: ruff drawing only 1 round of trumps:
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


at|
OK, let's try with only one round of trumps...|pc|cacc|sb|s|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


pc|sssas|
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


pc|ckccc|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


pc|ccs9s|sb|SOuch!!!|sk||at|
You'll lose two more @ss and one @h and go down 1. The plan was not good enough.|
hc|skqhk|

%% 2nd try:  draw 2 rounds of trumps:
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


up|15|nt|Try it once more.|lc|skqhk|sb|s|sk|S|

sb|SI must draw 2 rounds of trump.|

pc|sssas|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


pc|ssss|sb|s|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


pc|sscs|sk||sb|SOuch again!!|at|
Now you have only 1 trump left to ruff two @cs. You'll lose a @h and a @c for -1.
Playing the @sA and a small @s is incorrect. If you play this way, the defender with 3 trumps will be able to play a 3rd round, taking away from you one necessary ruff.|hc|h2c8|

%% 3rd try:  Coup en blanc to manage to draw exactly 2 rounds of trumps:
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


sb|S|sk|s|lc|h2c8|at|
Do you see the solution now? Remember how important card the A is to control the suit. How can you manage to draw exactly 2 rounds of trumps?|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


sb|sI got it. I need to do Coup en blanc....|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


up|15|nt|Try it once more.|
pc|cacc|sb|s|
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


pc|ssssT|
at|
Exactly. By keeping the @sA you kept the trump suit under control.
Now the play is easy. You take every return, play the @sA (if defenders didn't return trump) and ruff 2 clubs in dummy. Good @ds provide enough entries to do so.|
pg| ***** 94 ***** |

%% Alternative route
sk|S|nt|Finally let's go back to our discussion of which hand should be the master-hand. Do you see why South has easier to avoid losers?|up|28|
pg| ***** 102 ***** |


sb|sNot really. Both hands appear the same. In North we could also ruff heart losers in dummy.|
pg| ***** 103 ***** |


at|
Yes, both hands have the same number of trumps (4), similar trump quality (Hxxx vs xxxx) and the same number of losers (5). The key difference is the last criteria, the difficulty to avoid the losers. The clear advantage of the South hand is the preparedness to ruff clubs at once, without giving the lead to opponents.|sb|s|
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


nt|If you elect the North hand as the master-hand, you will note that not only you lose the lead for the necessary Coup en blanc in the trump suit but also once more in @h to prepare the ruff. Let me demonstrate it...|

{Example 2: Berthe/Lebely "Pas a pas II" page 30 hand 11}}

{Example 3: Berthe/Lebely "Pas a pas II" page 47 hand 19}}

The great book "Pas a pas" from which I take the most of my examples is only available in French or in German.
The English version "Step by Step" is out of order. You must try to get it in an "used bookstore"
