fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back 
yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned SAYC, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

qx|Xtra,T|mn|Convention Card: Part 2 Major Opening|
tu||
fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Convention Card: Part 2  Major Opening  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|^b@2^*BPart 2: Major Openings ++^*N

Tonight we will do part 2 of our study "filling out the Convention Card": opening bids of 1 of a Major.

We use a few conventions and treatments playing 1 of a Major: 
In first or second seat: a 1M opening promises 5 cards or longer 
In third or 4th seat, very rarely open with a strong 4 card suit.  
Example: with   @SAx   @HAKQ10   @DQxx   @Cxxxx     open 1@h in third or 4th seat.  
You want a heart led, not a club, and if the opps overcall 1@S, you may lose the @h suit.

In the RESPONSES section:
- double raise is WEAK (alertable).  
- after overcall, double raise is WEAK. 

Conventional raise:  we check 2NT and Splinter (both alertable).
In the Other section:  Bergen Raises (some people play reverse Bergen).

1NT Forcing by unpassed hand and we check 1NT SEMI-FORCING by passed hand. 
Some people use 1NT forcing by passed hand, but I agree with Bergen here - semiforcing over a passed hand. 
What is "semi-forcing?" |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at| 
Essentially, if third seat opens a subminimum hand, something like  @SKJxxx   @HAxx   @Dxxx   @CQx    you will pass a semi-forcing 1NT.      You write "UPH" over forcing, "PH" over semi-forcing ( UPH = unpassed hand).

We also play 2-way reverse Drury.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||ht|c|cp|2|at|^b@2Other treatments and understandings:  
1) a single raise is constructive, showing 3-card support and an 8-loser hand. 
2) Because we play 2 over 1 GF,  we use these CONVENTIONAL CALLS:
  a) NEW MINOR FORCING is a 1 round force and is alertable, 
  b) WEAK JUMP SHIFTS, only into majors after opening 1@C or 1@d, and always in competition;  
  c) FOURTH SUIT FORCING: my preference is to use it as game forcing. If you want to use it as 1 round force, that is 
     acceptable, but I think not as useful as game force (alertable). 
4) The auction 1@S--1NT/ 2@C--2@S shows a hand too weak to make a constructive raise. 
5) 1M - 3NT = 3334 shape, no 4-card Major, 13-15 HCP.  The reason for this response is that it defines responder's 
   hand very narrowly, and opener knows immediately whether to make a slam try.

BERGEN RAISES: A Bergen raise shows 4-card support and less than game-forcing values:  
1@S - 3@s = 0 to 6 points; 
1@S - 3@c = 7 to 9+ dummy points; 
1@S - 3@D = 10 to 12 dummy points.  I do not recommend reverse Bergen, because you are more likely to need a game 
try after a 7 to 9 point raise than after a 10 to 12 point raise.

Developments after 1@S -- 3@C:  Opener rebids 3@D as game try.  Responder signs off at 3@S with minimum hand, 
any other bid shows a MAXIMUM (8 or 9 dummy points); 
if responder bids a new suit over 3@D, it shows both a maximum and a feature (A or K). 

Developments after 1@S-- 2@S:  After a single raise, a new suit by opener is a HELP SUIT GAME TRY.  
Opener asks responder to look only at the second suit.  If responder can help avoid 3 quick losers in that suit, s/he bids game. Otherwise, sign off at 3 of the Major. 
If opener bids again after a signoff, it cancels the meaning of Help Suit.  Opener is showing a genuine 2-suiter with
extras, something like  @SKQ10xx   @hAx   @dAK109x   @Cx   where there is a good chance for slam.
Example responder raised to 2@S with:    @sAxx   @hKJxx   @DJxxx   @cxx      Now slam is at worst 50%.
The auction:   1@s - 2@s/3@D - 3@S/4@C* - 4@H* / 4NT - 5@C (RKC 1430) / 6@s  
(4@c + 4@h are Italian control bids, see later  *ICB) |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||ht|c|cp|2|at|^b@2
Self-Splinter: the auction 1@h - 2@h / 3@S (or 4@C or 4@D) shows a game-going hand, usually 6 or fewer losers AND a 
singleton or void, e.g    @sKQ10xx   @hAxx   @dAKJx   @cx 

Note the first hand had 5-5 shape, this one is 5341. By using the HSGT followed by another bid, opener can distinguish 
between strong 5521 hands, or self-splinter with strong 5431 hands.

Optional: 1@H - 2@H/ 2NT:  If opener bids 2NT after a constructive raise, responder bids his worthless short suit 
(2 or fewer cards). This allows opener to judge how well hands fit without disclosing it to the defenders. 
Example:    Kx   AK10xx   xx   AJ10x 
Since no HSGT will tell opener what she needs to know, she bids 2NT over 2@H raise. 
If responder has worthless shortness in either minor, game chances are good. 

There are many other gadgets that can be added to this structure. We did not discuss dealing with overcalls or doubles,
which are treated on the back of the card. We will deal with them later on.
This presentation represents a fairly standard treatment of Major suit bids on BBO.
If you play duplicate, this is also pretty standard among tournament players.
There are some local variations - e.g. some people use limit raises instead of Bergen, and use the 3NT bid over 1@S 
as 16-18.

Another treatment: 1@S  - 1NT / 2 any - 2NT = 10-11 (or horrible 12) HCP.
Also, very important: 1@S - 1NT / 2 any - 3NT = 16-18 HCP.
Using those treatments, responder can describe balanced hands without going past 3NT.

*ICB = Italian Control Bids. Here is how they work: 
Let's suppose that the auction begins 1@C - 1@H / 3@H. Opener has 16-18 support points and we are in a game forcing auction with Hearts as trumps. A new suit now by either partner is a control-showing bid. If the control bid is below game level, it shows first or second round control in the suit. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||ht|c|cp|2|at|^b@2
Also, you show controls UP THE LINE. If the control bid is ABOVE game, it promises first round control. 
Here is an example:

1@c - 1@H / 3@H - 4@C shows extra values (slam try) by responder, either @CA, @CK, void or singleton (you can clarify later) 
AND since we bid controls up the line, it denies a spade control. 

Let's suppose that opener, having heard the 4@C bid, now bids 4@D, also a control bid. Since responder is known not to 
have spade control (bypassed 3@S), the 4@D bid promises a diamond control AND ALSO a spade control 
(if opener didn't have a spade control, he just stops at 4@H because spades are wide open). 

The idea of showing A or K is to discover below game level if you have more than one fast loser in a side suit. 
Key Card Blackwood will handle trump losers, so ICB's will help stay out of 33 point slams off the AK of a suit. 

OK, let's play some bridge!

at|mitche: Bidding: Unless North overbids with 3@D, I think it's really hard to get to 6@d.  
So 3NT is probably the contract that everyone will get to, just as N/S did here.
Note: West's hand is just too cruddy for a 2@s WJO over 1@H.

at|mitche:  Play:   Only 1 item to consider: how to play the @D suit.  If they split 4-0 and EAST has all 4, declarer can
do nothing about it.  But if WEST has @dJ1065, declarer should play the @DQ first.  Then, if East discards, declarer can 
finesse twice in @D to pick up the suit.  So South made the "book" play with the @DQ.
You should pay attention to these standard positions, like Qxx(x) opposite AK98x(x) as they come up pretty often.

at|mitche: Bidding: I wonder what 1@S was; if it was a misclick, then please ask for undo.
If South intended to bid clubs, this hand is too weak for 2@C, and the club suit is too thin for 3@C, so best idea for
South would be to pass.  
Anyway, the 1@S bid gave West a chance to bid 2@S, to show 10+ dummy points and 4 hearts.
And E/W eventually got to a good 4@h contract.  A cue bid by responder here is a 1 round force, and it shows either a
limit raise (+) OR a game-forcing hand with responder having  her own good suit.  A free bid by responder is 1 round
force in SA, so most of the time, the cue bid shows the limit raise.|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: I use a treatment called "negative free bids" in my standard partnerships, so I need to use either a negative
X or cue bid to show a big hand.  Also, I will use the cue bid over a Major to show good 3-card support, K10x or so.
There are other treatments available, but they tend to get kind of complicated.
Well, cue = limit raise (+) is pretty standard, and over a double, 2NT as limit raise is the Jordan convention.  
As for the opening 1@H, sure, why not -- 2 quick tricks, 4-5 in the Majors, Bergen 20.  I would like the @CA to be better placed, 
and that is a negative on the hand, but I like opening any reasonable chance I get.

at|mitche: Play: At trick 1, North missed an inference.  She sees the @D7 as opening lead, and the only cards she cannot
see in the suit are K82.  When declarer plays the 2, North knows that all the cards but the K8 are accounted for, yes?
So she should ask, "from what @D holding would South lead the 7"?  
Clearly, it would not be from K7 or 87 doubleton.  And if it isn't from either of those holdings, it is either from the K87 or
singleton 7.  So the story the 7 tells is either K87 or singleton.  Either way, North can work out that it is 100% safe to lead
a small @D at trick 2 (small for suit preference, showing something good in clubs). |
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: It is a fundamental defensive principle.. try to work out suit placement based on cards you see at trick 1.
South will ruff the @D, and if declarer guesses to play the @DK (he should not), the contract will fail by 1 trick.

As for the losing spade finesse.. on the bidding, I would have taken the finesse too, but I would also wonder if South 
has @sQ109xx and did not give his partner a ruff.

at|mitche: Bidding: What do you all think of Norths 3@c bid? What would you have bid?|
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


at|
First thought:   West's pass gave N/S a free run  - If she thought the hand was good enough to make a jump overcall 
over 1@D, then she might have opened 2@S in first seat, BEFORE N/S  had the chance to exchange all that information.
So can we agree that 2@S in first position is a better idea than 2@S over 1@D? As a general point, you are almost always 
better off to get the first bid in.|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


nt||
at|Realrowdy:  Do you open weak in 1st seat?  Have heard so many views on that never know what is right.
mitche:  Liza, I think that a first/second seat DISCIPLINED weak 2 is a pretty good idea, especially when the opps are
vulnerable.  Here, 2@S means North has the choice of an offshape 2NT or a 3@C underbid.
And North won't like either one.  So 2@S is --
a) safe, with the @SQJ10xxx and 
b) effective in disrupting N/S bidding.|
pg| ***** 71 ***** |

at|mitche:  Now, on to 3@C.  I think that North has 3 plausible bids: 3@C, 3NT, or X. 
3@C is an underbid.   3NT is a pretty fair guess, and if I am going to guess, I am gonna guess the bid that, if it works, 
gives me the best score.  
And X, if it isn't a support X, should be a "card-showing" double, asking responder to do something smart.  
Here, South would bid 2NT (or maybe 3NT.)

at|mitche: Play: I think that declarer's play should be to duck the first spade, win the second, and then clear the 
clubs.  Once the clubs are cleared, she can go after diamonds in complete safety.
At Matchpoints, the problem is a bit different. If you want to maximize your chances for overtricks, you must win 
the first spade and hope to bring in 6 clubs, 2 spades, 2 hearts, and 4 diamonds.
So lead small @D to K, and then a second @D to hand.
Reason... If west has long spades, it is about 60% chance that East will be the only one who can win a club trick. |
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  (The @DA would be West's only entry to the spade suit - we want to remove the entry to the long suit as soon as we can.)  When East gets in with a club, she is unable to return a spade; you ducked the first spade.

at|mitche: Bidding: With a defensive trick, I think I would bid 1@S rather than preempting. 
I am not worried about being outbid when I have 7 spades, and I want to tell pard I have some cards outside the @s suit.
But, I think that (even at this vulnerability), N/S can't sell out to 2@S.  South might balance with a double - with a
decent 9 count, SOUTH knows that N/S have the balance of strength and with spade shortness, N/S will have a fit somewhere.
If South is averse to doubling, she can make a slight underbid of 3@D (North did open 1@D, and the odds are pretty 
good that she has 4 of them).|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: And that leads me to East's pass of 2@S.  
When pard preempts and I have AK9 of her suit, I raise.  Do not wait!  When you make a delayed raise, you give the
opponents a "fielder's choice."  They can either let you play or look for their own fit or double.   
That is why West wants to show a defensive value, by the way.  East won't be taking a "phantom save" when she knows 
that West has some defense, too.  (Actually, if East raises to 3@S, West will take a 4-level "sacrifice" and make it.)

at|mitche:  Play:  What card did South play on the @HA at trick 1?  It was the 2.
What does the 2 mean?  It means, "No @HQ."
It is discouraging -- So North may wish to look for a reasonable shift.
Now here, North may reason that the club suit might give declarer a few discards (it will), so cashing the @HK makes 
sense here.
But the important thing: the @H2 says that South has no great love of hearts.|
pg| ***** 107 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: When declarer gets a club shift to her J, she then should play off the @CA and then a trump to dummy, followed by a club ruff.       When the outstanding clubs divide 3-3, she discards the losing @D and takes 11 tricks.
OK, let's summarize the key points from these hands:
a) If you have a hand worth bidding in first/second seat, it is to your advantage to do so. Getting the first bid in 
is a great advantage.
b) When third hand sees the opening lead, she should try to work out what the opening leader's holding is in that suit. 
Sometimes you will be able to work out the entire suit at trick 1.|
