fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back 
yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned SAYC, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.

at|mitche: Bidding: I think that West's 4@h bid with 7-4 shape is a pretty decent idea.  
If East shows up with as little as the @DA and nothing else, the contract might make.
So 4@h puts maximum pressure on N/S. If they guess to bid on instead of double, they will not like the results.
Noah121:  Would you have opened North's hand 1NT?
mitche:  No, I would begin 1@S.  I do open 5332 hands 1NT.  But with 5422 open 1@S.
North has to figure that his side has the balance of power, so the X makes sense.

at|mitche: Play: I lead a trump.
Sometimes I will bury an honor in Pard's hand, but more often declarer will need to lead away from any honors he has.
veeree: I wanted to see the dummy. 
The @SA might work out OK, too ... but declarer rates to be short in spades.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |

The defense can win at least 1 more trick: South saw North discard on the third @D (trick 10)
so she knows declarer started with: 7 hearts, 4 diamonds, and had followed to 1 spade and a small club (toward the K). |

at|mitche:  Bidding:  Even with a lot of points, South should probably pass 1NT, for 2 reasons:  
- her 5 card @H suit is relatively weak, having just 1 honor.  
- her high cards are better suited for defense. 

When you come in over an opening bid of 1NT, you should have good suits.

at|mitche:  Play:  OK, so 1NT became the contract.
How'd the play to the first couple of tricks go?  Remember?  Declarer won the @HK (North played the 10).
And then after the @C finesse lost, North returned the @HJ, which South won with the @hAce.
Now, the hearts in South hand were @H983, and the only heart higher than the @h9 was on display in dummy.
So playing the @h9 forces out the @hQ, and the @h83 are the only hearts still out.

The odds are absolutely 100% sure that declarer will need to lose a trick to one of South's aces.|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So South can then cash 2 more hearts. Which along with the 1 in the bank, the club, and the 2 aces are enough 
to defeat 1NT, even if declarer has the @CA.  And the @DQ is sure to score, too.
So South can see a certain set by playing a third heart.

Defending NT is usually a race between declarer and defenders to see who can set up (establish) their suit first.
Here, the defense will win the race by hammering away at hearts. |

at|mitche: Bidding: In second seat at unfavorable vulnerability, I would not open West hand 
.... so even with 7 cruddy spades, passing is the right decision.
East, over 1@C opted to bid 1@h, which is OK, and I would have been OK with a take-out double. 
(AKJ looks like adequate support for spades). 
West's 2@s was intended as a weak jump; I guess it's impossible for it to be anything else, based on the auction.
But beware that some people may think that the jump shift is a "fit jump", showing support for the overcaller's suit 
and a good outside suit.|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  East won't be confused by the bid 
(with that spade holding, West can hardly be advertising a good side suit for hearts)

GG_Bridge: Could South open 2@H?
mitche:  South could have, yes. 
I think you need to have some understanding about suit quality for a weak 2 in first (and especially in second) seat.

at|mitche: Play: North's opening lead of the @hA breaks 2 pretty solid principles of defense.
First, do not lead unsupported Aces in side suits at trump contracts.
Second, don't lead their long suits.  Dummy advertised a heart suit, right?
Defenders do not usually want to set up declarer's suit for him.
I lead the @DQ with North hand (clubs and hearts are out, and I might find pard with some @D strength
(East overcalled,  West made a weak jump bid).|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


nt||
at|azin: What would you think of North bidding 5@C?  -500 even doubled is better than -650.
mitche:  Well, it's hard to know whether to bid or defend.  
At team games, you may want to take out insurance by bidding 5@C. 
But you could also hope to defeat 4@S.  
Declarer has 3 losers (2 diamonds and a club) and may not be able to make if he has as much as a singleton @h.  
So it's almost a "flip a coin" decision. |
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Bidding 5@C might save 4 IMPS, but it also might work out.  
So I don't know if I bid 5@C with North hand.    I would probably guess to defend. 
Play of 4@s is pretty straightforward.   
Declarer should plan to ruff 2 clubs in dummy (when the defense does not go after trumps)

at|mitche: Bidding: 10 losers in west hand?
At least I recommend using losing trick count (LTC) as follows:  
With 9 losers and 3-card support, raise 1@h or 1@S to 2 (constructive)
If you have more than 9 losers, then bid 1NT forcing and then a minimum support bid of opener's Major.
Here, if East rebid 2@D over 1NT, West would then bid 2@h to show a hand with a lot of losers. 
And E-W would stay at the 2-level, instead of a risky 3-level contract.|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


nt||
at|azin: But East could have a bigger hand.
mitche: One of the GREAT advantages of forcing 1NT is the ability to avoid the 3-level on these types of hands.
If East has a bigger hand, he will know whether it's safe to bid past the 2-level.
Your job as responder is to convey what you have.   And here West has a 1NT bid followed by 2@h.
Even if East were to bid 3@d over 1NT, West would bid just 3@h.  
If East thought that West had a 9 loser hand, she would add her 5 loser hand to 9, come up with 14, and guess to bid 4@h|
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Yes, it makes 4 with proper play: but let me get to that in a second.
It is really important that you learn to communicate the strength of your hand. And in 2 over 1, a raise to 2@h shows a 
"constructive" hand.  Even if West had @sJ10x instead of @s109x, his correct bid would be 1NT, not 2@h.
azin:  But East has 20 declarer points and 20+6/7 is game.
mitche:  To quote Marty Bergen "points, schmoints."  East should have bid 4@h over 2@h.
Which is why it is important for West to communicate that his hand is not very good.
I hope that by now, the point is clear: West's 4333 hand with 10 losers is not good enough for an immediate raise to 2@h.

at|mitche: Play: Double dummy, here is how E/W make 4 hearts.
Declarer wins the first @D in dummy, leads small heart to the @hJ, then the Ace (dropping the doubleton K).
now declarer has just 3 losers, the diamond, the spade, and the club.

That line is pretty obscure... I wouldn't find it myself more than half the time.
btour: This one would be good to discuss MPs, since when dummy comes down all those in 4@h will have to play that line 
so how should you adjust? |
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  You must go plus on this deal, so best line would be to play @HA, heart, so as to lose at most 1 ruff.
I need to make a different point about the defense than to get into any more DD lines.
When North won the @hK, she led a @D to give her partner a ruff.  Remember which one it was?|

It was the @DJ.  Where is North's entry?

pg| ***** 87 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: So better:  When North leads that @D, she should lead her lowest one to ask for a club return.
(the @dJ asked for a spade return, and partner obliged)
South ruffs, plays a club to the Ace, then scores another ruff (remember the @HQ went at trick 2).

at|mitche: Play: Opening lead was the @C5.  East should, with a doubleton, lead the @c8, so that West has a better idea 
of the lay of the land.  
Here, with a singleton club in dummy, it is probably best for West to win the Ace and shift to a small spade.  
Why a small spade?|
pg| ***** 100 ***** |


at|
East must have something good in spades or else the contract must be cold, and you would like to set up spades before 
declarer cashes her tricks.|
pg| ***** 101 ***** |


nt||at|azin: 3@C followed by 3NT promises at least 2 Club stoppers. Therefore leading a club probably not a good idea.  
I would have led a spade. @SQ for example. 
mitche: No, Azin, the 3NT does not promise 2 stoppers.  It promises 1. 
And when West overcalls 2@c, it is completely correct for East to lead your suit.  An overcall is lead-directing.
Note that the spade lead would put declarer in dummy.  Now declarer needs the @DK or @hA to make the hand.
So in summary: East should lead the @C8, top of doubleton, and West should win the @cAce and lead a spade.|

at|mitche: Bidding: There are a lot of contracts you can make, but should not bid, and 4@s is one of them.
E/W would not like being in 4@s if they were divided 4-2 and West were tapped at trick 2.
But let's look at the bidding.

3@h was mildly unlucky.  I would like a better suit (one of top 2, and 3 of top 5 honors) to bid 3@h vul.
When West reopened with a double, East decided to defend, rather than bid 4@c, 3NT or any number of spades.

at|mitche: Play: East guessed to lead a spade (best).    West played the @SA followed by the @SK 
(better is @sK, then @sAce, by the way - as defender, you want to win a trick, usually, with the lowest of equals).  
Then, after cashing 2 spades, played a club and a second club-- that is reasonable defense.
(though west trusting partner's lead and trick 2 knows declarer has another @s)
Declarer then decided to play the @DQ and rise with the ace.  I guess she was hoping to pin a singleton offside King.
But if West has the singleton @dK, then East had @d1097 tripleton and the diamonds were not going to produce more than 
2 tricks.  East would never cover anyway.|

at|mitche: If declarer has @dQxx, then West has singleton, and will ruff the second round.  
And if the @dQ is singleton, then it is imperative that East hold off.  And finally if the diamonds are 2-2, then it doesn't matter.

So ducking is right  (well, it's the correct technical play).
Declarer's "psychological" play shouldn't work if the defenders are on their toes.
Anyway, when declarer rose with the ace, the contract was due to fail by 3 tricks.|
