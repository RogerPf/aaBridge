fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back 
yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned SAYC, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.

sk||at|mitche: Bidding: I don't recommend 2NT on this kind of hand, since it has 2 defects:   
The shape (5422) and the fact that one of the suits is wide open.
That said, with 21 HCP, what to do?|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|
My suggestion is 1@D.
If partner passes, you haven't missed game, and if he shows any sign of life, opener can reverse into 2@S.
Notice that (while it's not easy), 2NT can go down if East can "guess" to lead a club when she gets in with the @DQ 
(beats 2NT, 2 tricks, in fact).

Also, remember which card partner played third hand on the opening lead?
It was the @s9 "third hand high" => There is really no future in the @s suit.|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


at|
When playing Lavinthal, the first discard, here a low @h says: I'm not interest in the @h suit
I am interested in the lowest of the 2 remaining (as you can rule out spades considering my first play to spades)
And I really can't be interested in @d as I showed out and discarded there!
So all points to the club suit.   Better of course to discard the low @s sending the same message.|

at|mitche:  Play:  I recommend not playing odd/even discards against NT - and I think you should try not to discard from 
the suit you want to run versus NT. (the club suit here)
BILAsst10: What can she discard then?
mitche:  Something like Lavinthal.  You discard the suit you don't like, and high card says "higher ranking suit";
low discard = "lower ranking suit."
So a low spade says, "not spades, lower of the 2 remaining: hearts and clubs."|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  West also must hang onto hearts, to avoid setting up the long @h in dummy.
One last point on defense: When East led her lowest spade at trick 1, West played the 9.  
Since third-hand-high is correct in this situation East knows that spades are hopeless for the defense, 
so she should think about a shift when in with the @DQ.  
That might lead her to the lethal club shift as well. |

|sk||

at|mitche:   Bidding:  There are 2 problems we have to address:  
First, East has to think about what she will do if pard bids 1@h over 1@C.  
2@c strongly suggests a 6-card suit, which she doesn't have.
And 1NT suggests a second heart (and also, a weaker hand -- East has 16 HCP).
So there are 3 ways to deal with that.   First, plan to rebid 2@d over 1@h, a REVERSE. 
That has its own problems, like really cruddy suits, and some people agree you need 17 points for a reverse 
(I think you do not, just good suits and about a King better than minimum opener)|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt||

at|mitche:  Second solution: open an off shape 1NT. 
If you do open an off shape 1NT, please be 4441, not 5431
And the third is to open 1@D and rebid 2@c. 
That is a bit of an underbid, but I think the best solution to the problem of opening this kind of hand. 
Pard will think you have just 4 clubs and 5 diamonds, but you won't get into a lot of trouble that way.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


at|
Now, what should West do after (the underbid of) 2@C?
Her strength and hand pattern make 3@h look like a good idea, but the suit quality just doesn't.  |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt||

at|mitche:  When you bid 3@H (jump rebid in your suit), you are making a NON-forcing bid, showing a GOOD suit and 
about 10 - 11 points. 
Change the @SK to the @HK so that West's hand were something like @sxxx, @hKQ109xx, @dAQx, @cx 
and 3@h would be a winner.

Better here is for West to bid a "new suit forcing" - 2@d|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt||

at|mitche: Agreement: a new suit bid by an UNPASSED responder is forcing for 1 round.
That one goes back to the 1960's and ACOL - when I was a kid in knee pants and no long, white beard.

East would probably bid 3@D and West would now rebid 3@h, allegedly showing 6-4 distribution - 
but also deemphasizing the quality of the @h suit.
The agreement that a new suit by unpassed responder is 1 round forcing is pretty standard. 
I recommend that you remember it and use it.|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt||
at|duffer66:  So all new suits forcing by unpassed hand?
mitche:  If the auction were 1@S - 2@h, that is game forcing - we play 2 over 1.
The auction 1@C 1@h / 2@c 2@h is (of course) not forcing, as not a NEW suit
The thing you want to remember here: the jump rebid by responder is  
a) not forcing and 
b) shows a suit that will usually play for 1 loser opposite a singleton, something like KQ109xx or better.|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So East was  justified in bidding 4@h with her super maximum "minimum" and trump honor.

If West were to bid 2@d, raised to 3@d, then E/W might reach 3NT, which is taking 8 tricks for sure, 
and possibly a 9th on an endplay -- could South eventually be thrown in, to lead a heart.

at|mitche:  Play:  The opening lead was a small @d
I think I would lead the @S3 here, hoping that partner can win an early trump and give me a ruff. 
Leading from the @DJ doesn't rate to build up a lot of tricks on defense.
veeree:  I was told not to lead from doubleton unless you have 3-4 trumps.
mitche:  Most of the time that is true, but here you want to attack one of the unbid suits. 
Declarer rates to get rid of losers once she gets clubs going. |
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Since they did not look for 3NT, they rate not to have spades.  East did not bid spades over 1@h. 
So pard will very likely have 4 or 5 of them.  In effect, you're leading partner's long suit. 
Declarer play: When you win the @D at trick 1, play a CLUB at trick 2.  You need to get rid of spade loser.

SK||

at|mitche:  Bidding:  If you have looked at the Modern Losing Trick count handout, you know that a raise of 1@h to 2@h 
shows a hand with 3-card support and 9 losers. ("constructive") 
How many losers should we count in the North hand?  What's the word on Qxx?  The handout is pretty clear here.
Count a holding of QJx or QTx as two losers;  but count a holding Qxx (without the Jack or 10) as three losers.  
So we count the North hand as 10 losers.
With that hand, the preferred auction is a forcing 1NT, followed by 2@h over opener's 2@c bid.|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  If South knows how many losers North has, she can judge better whether to compete, and how high.
Please remember that forcing 1NT allows you to show bad versus good raises to 2@h.

Next:  East's double of 2@h forces West to bid on what could be a complete bust, right?
So a raise of 2@s to 3@s in this auction shows a hand about an Ace better than the one East actually held.
Had North bid 3@h, East's hand would pass. It should also pass over 2@S.
So 3@s is an overbid.|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


nt||
at|kat827:  Is South's hand strong enough to use a game try (given the distribution points), and do game try bids apply 
after the Dbl?
mitche:  I don't think so ... remember that 2@H shows 9 losers.
South has just an 8-card fit and 7 losers. 9 + 7 = 16, so that is not enough to justify looking for a 10-trick game --
(24 - 16 = 8, meaning an 8-trick contract is safe, 3@h is competing).

at|mitch: Play: Since North a showed 3-card support with her 2@h bid, the @h9 lead conventionally shows no honor.  
Best line of defense to defeat the contract would be for South to continue with a third heart to make dummy ruff.  
Declarer will now have some serious communications problems.  
If she plays 3 rounds of trumps, she will not be happy when the defense plays a 4th heart when in with either 
the @DA or @CA.

sk||

at|mitche: Bidding: If you aren't using minor-suit transfer bids at all, 
the auction 1NT - 2@C - 2Major - 3@d should be a sign-off bid.
And 1NT -  2@c / 2@d - 3@d should be forcing (if responder has bad hand with long diamonds, s/he passes 2@d).
OK, if 3@d is forcing, then North just bids 3NT and is done.
Banoole:  Was it forcing?
mitche:  Well, North did not think so. I think it should have been.  Again, if South has a bad hand with diamonds,
she passes 2@d.  So 3@d is forcing. |
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  You cannot have both invitational and forcing auctions without transfer bids; 
I am not sure if very many standard (no transfer) players treat 1NT - 2@c/ 2@H - 3@D as invitational.
Most of them would use 1NT - 2@C / 2@H - 2NT as invitational. 
Or 1NT - 2@c / 2@d - 2NT as invitational.  So 3@D is almost always treated as GF.
Over 3@d north should bid 3NT, and that 3@d should give North the chance to look for a diamond SLAM with a 
max and good @D support.
Anyway, they need to get to 3NT, which should take at least 10 and maybe 11 tricks.

at|mitche: Bidding:  The bidding made reasonable sense... some might want to pass the West hand in 4th seat,
as it doesn't quite make the rule of 15 - adding high card points plus spades, and if the total is less than 15, 
pass the hand out.

at|mitche:  Play:  The @CJ is the standard lead from @cAJ108.
I recommend that you learn coded jacks, 10's and 9's. 
Here is a link:   ^*hwww.bridgehands.com/C/Coded_9_and_10_Jack_Denies_10_Implies.htm^*n
They are also discussed at length in Kantar's excellent books on defense.
If declarer ducks the @cJack, she should probably duck the @c10, too... if a third round of the suit is played, 
then declarer should rise with the @cK.|
pg| ***** 120 ***** |


nt||

at|mitche:  Someone asked why coded leads.. they make it easier for the defense to locate all the honors in the suit led. 
Sometimes that helps declarer more than the defense, but on balance, you gain more than you lose with coded leads. 
You can also use A from AK, so as to eliminate confusion about King leads.

MM:  By clicking on the cards, you can play the hand Double Dummy, 
To continue with the next deal click the  ^$40

at|mitche:  Bidding:  I agree with all of the bids made, except one.
Which bid do you think I have problems with?|
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


at|
3@s, but not by much.
The 2@s bid shows 9-12.  North's @CJ is worthless, so she can discount it =>  
11 HCP, plus 1 for 5th spade = initial valuation of 12.
And North has more than enough to accept the 3@s invitation.
South has 14 HCP, but again, the @CQ is likely to be worthless.  So a raise to 3@s is reasonable, but on the pushy side. |
pg| ***** 124 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  At matchpoints, I might pass. Only at IMPS would I think 3@S is 100% correct. 
So that's why I said " not by much" -- it is really close whether to invite; and it depends on the form of scoring.
GG_Bridge:  What counts more .. when evaluating for game .. LTC or HCP?

mitche:  LTC helps with bidding. But what matters in play is suit establishment. 
So for example, KQ10xxx opposite Jx is 6 points, but it produces 5 tricks.
AKQ opposite J109 is 10 HCP, but it's 3 tricks.|
pg| ***** 125 ***** |


nt||

at|mitche:  Actually, that was a good question, Charlene, because if you think about it, you will see that what matters 
is trick-taking ability.  And that is a function of both HCP and distribution, and to a lesser degree, the location of 
your honors and entries.

So the question will actually get you to think about how to play the hand.
The thing about your 8 loser hand, Camilla -- your hand is about as good as it could be for a 2@s bid, and your partner's 
3@s bid asked you how good you were. So you had an automatic raise to 4.|
Pg| ***** 126 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  And please note.. when the opponents bid a suit (clubs here), you should discount holdings of minor honors doubleton.  
They are frequently worthless.
3@S ain't awful.  It's just very agressive.  I play a lot of matchpoints, so I don't push to as many games there as I do 
at IMPs.
Again, 3@s is the right bid at IMPs scoring (in fact, 4@s should be defeated).

at|mitche: Play:  West must cover the @H8 at trick 10 to kill the @D discard. 

Ok, let's summarize the important ideas from tonight's hands.
a) Suit quality matters.. In Board 2, when West bid 3@h on Q9xxxx and got to a poor 4@h contract.  
Jump rebids of a suit show good suit texture.|
pg| ***** 139 ***** |

at|
b)Quacks need help to be of use.  When you evaluate your hand for bidding or inviting game - as in Board 6 - don't count 
doubleton Qx - Jx in suits the opponents bid as anything except a doubleton (in suit contracts)
and finally -
c) Any agreement is better than no agreement. Remember Board 4, where N/S stopped in 3@D when 3NT takes 11 tricks? 
No one made a mistake, really, because there was no agreement on how to handle that situation.|
pg| ***** 140 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  North should have asked herself, "if pard is weak, why did she raise to 3@d" and South might have reckoned,
"if North doesn't have a major, then she probably has stuff in the minors" to decide to bid 3NT.

MM: You can play the hand Double Dummy if you wish
This concludes this presentation, I hope you enjoyed, Karen10 & GG_Bridge
