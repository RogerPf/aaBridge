fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
First, forcing 1NT, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.


I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."
Mitch Edelman aka "mitche" 


MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.

at|mitche:  Bidding:  After 1@h or 1@s, an unpassed responder bids 1NT as forcing bid. 
So East may not pass 1NT.   Her bids are: 
a) with a weak hand and a 6-card spade suit, she rebids 2@s (or 2@h, if she opened 1@h);
b)  with 5 spades, 4+ hearts and minimum opener, rebid 2 hearts;
c) with 5 spades and fewer than 4@h's, rebid longer minor, which might be a 3-card suit;
d) with a hand too strong to OPEN 1NT, raise 1NT to 2, or if your hand is unbalanced, 
bid a new suit at the 3 level;|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||
at|e) with 15-18 points and a 6-card Major, jump rebid it at 3-level (not forcing).
That covers most of the common ways to respond to a forcing 1NT bid.
So East rebids 2@h.
West can either pass or bid her own suit (3@C) which is a weak bid.
I think West was correct to pass 2@h.
Should North balance?|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Let's see -- 
East advertised at most 15 points, and West passed, showing a maximum of 8 points.
That leaves 13 or more points in South hand.
So what do you think? Does North balance? |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|
North KNOWS that South has spade length. With a doubleton spade and 3 hearts, West would
correct to 2@S most of the time. That means South has at least 5 spades.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So where would N/S have tricks?|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|
West has spade shortness and couldn't bid over 2@h.  Which means West probably has length in a minor (at least 4).
So North can work out that E/W are on a misfit and they won't like the play. 
So passing is correct. 
It has nothing to do with the fact that North has a weak hand, because as we have shown, 
North knows South has a good hand with spades.

at|mitche:  Play:  South led the @DK, which forced out the ace, and then declarer played off 2 
black aces and ruffed a spade, overruffed.  
It is a virtual certainty that South either has the @DQ or a singleton @D.
If the @D was singleton, then declarer has 5 diamonds, which is impossible.

So North can lead a SMALL diamond at trick 5. 
When North does lead the Jack, South should not overtake. |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  South can also reason that if North has short diamonds, East must have 5 of them 
-- not possible on the auction.
But North should lead SMALL when she is in. 

LISTEN TO THE BIDDING and try to picture declarer's hand.
WestElsdon:  I was expecting a higher card on partner's play on the opening lead.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  What did she play, the 4 or the 3?
CarlieG:  The 3.  2 was also played, so lowest card.
mitche:  North should encourage with a higher card. When South leads the @DK, it strongly 
suggests holding the Queen. When you hold an "equivalent honor" to opener's lead, you 
should encourage. 

Oh, an "equivalent" honor, when opener holds the KQ is the Jack or the Ace.|

sk||
at|mitche: Bidding: East has a pretty decent hand when West shows hearts, and she should "superaccept".

There are a couple of ways to superaccept: 
First, bid 3 hearts, to show a MINIMUM 1NT and 4 hearts. 
Second, with a MAXIMUM and 4333 shape with 4 Hearts, bid 2NT.  
Third, with a Doubleton, bid the short suit.  So here, the superaccept is 2@s.|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  There is a small technical problem - if you have shortness in the suit below the
transfer suit (here, diamonds), a bid of 3@d takes away the ability to re-transfer 
(retransfer = responder repeats 3@d to get opener to bid 3@h, or 3@h to get opener to bid 3@s if 
responder has spades).

So 2NT does double duty, showing either 3433 or short @d's.
If you play Jacoby Transfers, you should learn and use superacceptance. |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Marty Bergen says that superacceptance is essential to get to good slams after opening 2NT.  
Keep superaccept in your bag of tricks, and discuss it in your serious partnerships.
CarlieG:  Is super accept with any 4 card fit for partner's transfer?
mitche:  Yes, you should always show that 4th card when responder transfers into your 4-card suit.
The reason is if you have a 5-4 fit, you will almost always play 1 trick better than a 5-3 fit.|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So if you can stand the 2 level with a 5-3 fit, the 3 level should be OK with a 5-4 fit.  
That is also part of the law of total tricks 
(well, it ain't a law, exactly, maybe more the "good idea" of total tricks.)|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


at|
CarlieG:  I don't need worry about partner having zero points?
mitche:  Nope. If responder is broke and transferring, she has to have a lot of distribution, 
because you pass 1NT with 5332 shape and no points.

She always has a club loser, and losing it early might result in North winning the opening lead and playing a spade.
Winning the @CA and planning to discard a spade on the long @D guarantees 11 tricks.

SK||

at|mitche:  Bidding:  The bidding was about what I think it should have been.
If you play "walsh style", East has enough strength to bid 1@d and plan to jump in NT 
or show strong support for hearts.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


at|
If E/W do play Walsh, then West should bid 1NT over 1@d, 
because with a weak hand East will bid a 4-card Major instead of 1@d.
And if East has a good hand (as she does here), she will bid 2 of her Major over 2NT.|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


at|
Anyway, when West bid 1@s, East properly bid 3NT.  She who knows, goes (another Bergenism).

at|mitch:  Play:  When South led a small diamond, East is sure of 3 diamond tricks 
- as long as she plays a small diamond from dummy and not the @DQ or @DJ.
Either the @D9 wins early, if South underled the @dK10, or North will play the @d10 or @DK at trick 1, 
in which case the @d9 is promoted. So with 3 tricks in the bag in @D, declarer has 9 sure tricks. 
She can play on hearts, I think, to set up a second @h trick, and probably she should.|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  As it happens, the defense cannot untangle their major suit winners to hold declarer to 9 tricks.
BILAsst10: How best to play the hearts?
mitche:  The best line for the hearts is to play small from dummy and cover North's card as gently as possible. 
If the @h8 or @h9 appears, declarer should play @hJ and if it loses to the @HQ or @hK, then lead the @hT and plan to run it.  If it's covered, play for 3-3 hearts.|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


nt||
at|CarlieG:  What does that mean to cover gently?
mitche:  Play the smallest card you can to beat North's card. 
If North plays the @hKing or @hQueen, return to dummy in spades or clubs to lead a second small heart.  
In other words, if North plays a high @H honor when you play small from dummy, you should play her for both of them.

sk||

at|mitche: Bidding: Finding a Major suit fit is so important that you should use the Drury convention
and not look for a minor suit contract unless your hand is really unbalanced. 
So with West hand, I would have bid 1NT over 1@S.
When West bids a natural 2@d over 1@s (not playing the Drury convention), showing 10+ HCP and almost certainly 5 of them,
East has a problem - there are 3 possible bids: 2NT, 2@s or pass.
2NT should show a full opening bid.  |
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


nt|| 
at|mitche:  East doesn't have one of them.  That leaves 2@s or pass.
At matchpoints, 2@s is obligatory, but at IMPS, you may just pack it in and pass 2@d on the grounds that a passed hand 
should ALWAYS show support for opener's Major when she has it.|
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


at|
So 2@d (natural) should show at MOST 2 spades, and probably just 1.|
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Passed hand bidding is different from constructive bidding when first/second seat opens.
Third hand can open a nice 10 point hand, so you do not have the luxury of bidding new suits at the 2 level
-- East might just pass 2@d.
Sometimes you will miss a good fit in a minor, but on balance, you do better to raise majors 
and to introduce a suit only to avoid a misfit.

sk||

at|mitche: Bidding:  1@h and 1NT are pretty standard. 
North has a pretty strong hand, and he needs to force responder to bid, so there are 2 choices -- 2@s or 3@c. 
I prefer 3@c because that is where he "lives", so to speak. 
He has a sound source of tricks and it tells partner that they should bid game somewhere.|
pg| ***** 100 ***** |


at|
The argument for 2@s is that if responder has a good holding in spades 
(change the @DKQ to the @sAce) then there might be a slam.|
pg| ***** 101 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  If North had bid 3@c, South could bid 3@h and North would then be able to bid 3@s as a slam try.  
Now here is the problem.  
The Reverse is a 1 round force, not a game force. 
How does South tell opener that her hand is a total disaster, versus a hand with game or slam potential?
BILAsst10: Fast arrival
mitche:  Yep.. so 3@h over 2@s should show a good heart raise, not just a simple bailout bid.|

at|mitche:  When South bids 4@h, she is denying any interest in slam, 
but imagine that North had the @DA, @CA, and @SAK, now 6 or 7 hearts or NT might be on. 
So South should bid 3@h and allow North to describe his hand.

Someone asked if South should bid 2@d instead of 1NT. I think it's pretty close.  
The advantage of 2@d is it gets N/S into a game-forcing auction, 
and South does have excellent 3-card heart support. |
pg| ***** 103 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  If you bid 2@D over 1@h and partner doesn't get excited about your suit, 
you must then sign off in 4@h (fast arrival) at your next bid.  So 2@d is OK here.
The advantage of 1NT instead of 2@d is that you get a better description of North's hand that way, 
I think, and you can still come to life.  It is almost a matter of style. 
gehrhorn:  If South had bid 3@h after 2@s do I start cuebidding with 3@s?
mitche:  Yes, you would cue bid 3@s over 3@h.

at|mitche: Play: East led her singleton club (best lead) and West ducked because the 6 was equivalent to all of West's cards. 
It doesn't matter here, but I think West wants to play a higher club, just because it gives East the idea that it's safe 
to continue the suit.
But East will be able to work out from whatever club West plays that it's necessary to shift to spades.|

nt||
at|mitche:  Declarer correctly decided to set up @D before playing trumps.  
And East worked out the spade shift, got her ruff, and that was that. 

MM:  By clicking on the cards, you can play the hand Double Dummy, 
please click the  ^$40 for the next board |

at|mitche: Bidding:  East has a "Bergen 20" (or Mitch 22) opener. 
But I might like better intermediates in the long suits, and at these colors and IMPS, I might pass anyhow.
It depends on how aggressive your opening style in first seat is.  
I don't like opening weak hands in first seat without spades.  
Suppose you have this hand -- @SKQ1072, @H643, @d52, @cKJ3 --
Would you open that hand 1@s in second seat?
Of course not. |
pg| ***** 121 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  But if you have favorable vulnerability and your RHO opens 1@d, would you OVERCALL 1@S?
with @SKQ1072, @H643, @d52, @cKJ3 (same hand) -- Of course you would!!
So when you open in first, and especially in second seat, you should be strong enough to tolerate a 1@s overcall.
East is not quite good enough at IMPS to open, I my opinion.
So, East did open and South had a hand that might want to get into the auction.
An overcall should show some minimum suit quality, and @hJ9743 is a bit too thin for me.|
pg| ***** 122 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  I might tell a little white lie and double 1@d rather than bid 1@h.
@sAQx is probably as good as Axxx, so I don't mind a takeout X with 3 spades to the AQx and neither should you.
Now, what does 1@S mean in this auction? |
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


at| 
When advancer bids a new suit as here, when first and second seats both bid, 
the third suit (1@s or 2@c here) is "non-forcing, constructive." 
That means overcaller may pass, and advancer has a decent 5-card suit with tolerance for overcaller's suit.|
pg| ***** 124 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So here 1@s is a poor choice.
With 14 points and a stopper in @D, I would probably hold my nose and cue bid 2@d to find out if South had a full opener. 
If South bids 2@h I would bid 2NT.
If advancer's cue bid of 2@d promises support for hearts, then North should probably bid 2NT over 1@h instead of 1@S.
South will bid 3NT, and that will make. |
pg| ***** 125 ***** |


nt||
at|BILAsst10: How should the bidding have gone?
mitche:  In the actual auction, after 1@S, South should not bid 1NT, but 2@s.  
The auction should be 1@D - X - pass -2@s - pass.  If South overcalls: then 1@D, 1@H, P, 2NT, P, 3NT.

at|mitche: Play: At 3NT:
If East leads small @D, North ducks the return of the small @D and will win 8 tricks in the black suits and the @DQ 
If West shifts to a heart at trick 2, 3NT will probably fail.. Declarer won't have time to set up his diamond.
Questions on theoretical bidding?|
pg| ***** 141 ***** |


nt||

at|mitche:  Play at 2@S:
East should not lead the @DA.  It is not correct to lead an unsupported ace in a side suit.  
The only excuse for doing so is if you think you will pin an honor in dummy or give partner a ruff.
Better is to lead a club, because on the auction, leading a @D is likely to blow a trick. 
If you lead the @DA you should continue the suit, but it is better to find a safe lead.. 
a trump might be best here... the bidding suggests that N/S will be cross-ruffing things.|
