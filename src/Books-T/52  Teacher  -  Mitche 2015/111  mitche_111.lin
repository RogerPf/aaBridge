fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back 
yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned SAYC, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

tu||
fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Convention Card: Part 3  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|^*b@2         ^*BOpening 1 of a Minor^*N^b@2

We are in the middle of a series of discussions on "filling out the convention card."  
A link for the ACBL convention card:          ^*hweb2.acbl.org/documentlibrary/play/ConventionCard.pdf^*n
There is also a "filling out the card" discussion on ACBL.org but it doesn't tell you much about what the boxes really mean.
Tonight we will do the third of four parts on the "front of the card," our own constructive bidding agreements.
Filling out the Convention Card 3: Opening 1 of a minor.
General ideas: because we play 5-card Majors, we frequently open 1@C or 1@D with 3-card suits.
There are several strategies for bidding 1 of a minor:

A: If you can't open 1 of a Major or 1NT , open your longer minor. 
With 3-3 in the minors open 1@C           with 4-4 in the minors open 1@D.
B: If you can't open 1 of a Major or 1NT , open your stronger minor, the one you would prefer led by your partner.
C: Open 1@D only with 4 of them, and if you can't open anything else, open 1@C (the classic short club).

We will use approach A, opening our longer minor. So we check off, Expected Min Length of 3 for both 1@C and 1@D.  
ACBL also suggests an arrow pointing to the left from the 3 box  toward the 4 box for 1@D.  The idea is that you 
usually have 4@D unless you are exactly 4=4=3=2 and your point count is outside the range for an opening 1NT bid.

Double Raise: Again, there are several approaches. The most common one among tournament players, and the one I 
recommend, is to use inverted minors. 
So 1@D - 3@D    or   1@c - 3@c    is WEAK (and alertable). 
After an Overcall, standard treatment is also to use a double raise as a weak bid. How weak is weak? 
I use 5+ cards and at most 5 HCP. And very importantly, NO 4 CARD MAJOR.
The general idea is we use the same structure for double raises of a minor as we do for Majors: 
the jump raise is weak.  The major difference is you need 4 cards for a weak raise of a major, 5 for a weak minor raise. 
The idea is that you want to take up as much space from the opponents as you can.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||ht|c|cp|2|at|^b@2
kat827:  So inverted minors apply after interference? 
mitche:  Yes, a double raise of a minor is weak – always.

Forcing Raise: Since we use a jump raise as weak, a single raise from 1@C to 2@C  or    1@d to 2@D is strong. 
How strong?    It depends..... On what?|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at|  
Whether you use Criss-Cross raises, too. 
Since most pairs do not use criss-cross raises, I suggest that a single raise shows 11+ dummy points and 5-card support. 
So 1@D - 2@D is "almost" game-forcing up to having a very good hand. 
I suggest you save "criss-cross" for established partnerships and tournament play.
If you don't use criss cross, you just bid 1NT.  
Sometimes that is a lie, because we like to use 1NT over 1@C as  8-10.  
1NT over 1@C  is therefore 8-10 HCP and it denies a 4-card Major.

Frequently bypass a 4-card @D?  Once again, there are 2 main approaches:
A: Walsh-Style -- 1@c - 1@D response is either weak, with no 4-card major,    or 
a hand strong enough to make 2 constructive bids, (at least 11 HCP)
B: Up-The-Line. Responder shows her lowest 4-card suit first, so 1@D would not deny a 4-card Major, 
and 1@C 1@H would deny a 4-card @D suit (most of the time, anyway).

My preference is Walsh style, because it gets the Majors going quickly. 
Note--some people will bypass a 5-card @D suit with a weak hand.   I think that some common sense is called for.  
Holding   @sx  @hJxxx  @dAKxxxx  @cxx    I will bid 1@D, even playing Walsh style. 
The risk is opener won't bid 1@h, and I will rebid 2@D, missing a 4-4 heart fit.
Bergen suggests that responder bid 1@D with a weak, flat hand, so OPENER can declare NT contracts. 
That is also the way to deal with the weak hand over 1@C
Note that 1@D - 1NT  may be 6-10
2NT: I prefer to use 2NT  to show a balanced 11-12 HCP hand with no 4-card Major.  
3NT: 4333 and 13-15 HCP, no 4-card Major. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||ht|c|cp|2|at|^b@2
When responder has a very large hand, s/he will usually bid a 4-card Major and use 4th suit forcing or a reverse 
(e.g. 1@c - 1@D/ 1NT - 2@h) to establish game force.

Other:  It is very important to know what is forcing. 
I recommend that any new suit by an unpassed responder is forcing for 1 round, 
so the auction 1@c - 1@D/ 1NT - 2@S is game forcing, but natural.  
If the auction is 1@C - 1@D/1@h - the jump to 2@S  is fourth suit forcing and artificial.  

If responder has a balanced hand, stronger than 15 points, but lacking a 4-card Major, 
when opener begins with 1@C, responder starts with 1@D followed by a jump to 3NT.  Why??
The auction 1@C - 1@D /1@h - 2NT  is invitational, showing 11-12 dummy points only. 
(Walsh style forces some rather awkward auctions on you.)

Now, for approach 2: up the line.
Up the line bidding is simpler, but also will result in some awkward auctions, especially when advancer (4th seat) can 
scrape up a 1@S bid. 
On balance, Walsh style will get you to a Major suit contract more often, but at the expense of missing the occasional minor suit game when that's right.  
kat827: If opener bids 1@C and you have 5 points (with two 4-card Majors) would you respond?  
Do you ever leave partner in 1@C?
mitche:  My rule of thumb: with a bad hand, 0-4 and no Ace or King, I pass. 
With 5 points, or 4 with an Ace, I will bid 1@h with both majors, so 1@C - 1@S denies 4 hearts. 
Another popular treatment is "preemptive Jump Responses." 
So 1@C/1@d - 2@H/2@S is a weak bid, not a strong jump shift.

General rule for preemptive jump response, Major over minor: responder shows 6+ card suit and no A or K outside the suit.  
AND, the Major is NOT headed by AKQ
Standard bidding is that jump-responses are alertable. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||ht|c|cp|2|at|^b@2
The most important questions you need to ask and agree on - what is your style for OPENING a minor 
(first part of discussion).
My recommendation is to open longer minor, because distribution (shape) is pretty important.
And second, with ESTABLISHED partnerships, I like Walsh style. 


OK, let's play some bridge!

|
at|mitche: Bidding: Let's first look at 3@d.  A double raise is weak, 0-5 points and shows 5+ diamonds. Why 5+? 
-- Opener could have a 3-card suit.  So North has not enough length and too much strength.  
So North should bid 1NT  
Over 1NT, East would pass, but over 3@D, she should, also.  
Reason: forcing partner to bid at the 3-level shows a decent hand, either with good shape or about 15 HCP minimum.  
South could have had 19 HCP, in which case the X could get you to a 9 trick contract on 14 or 15 total points and no particularly long suit.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: Now, what about 4@D over 3@H?  South has a balanced minimum - so he should just go quietly - 
as he did, the first time.  But 4@d was offering 300 or 500 to the opponents on a part-score hand.  
Putting it a different way.  If North has a preemptive @D raise, the opponents may be able to make 4@h with not a lot of difficulty.  They stopped at 3@h.  Don't give them a chance to find a making game.
BILAsst10: If North bids 1NT should South pass that - apparently not enough for game.
mitche:  Yes, South passes 1NT, and West might balance, but probably won't (and shouldn't).

at|mitche:  Play:  If West wants to start with a spade lead, she should lead the 6, small from 3 to an honor is standard 
carding.  After the defense cashes 3 spades, West took her @CA to guarantee the set.  
It's pretty unlikely that declarer has discards for the 3 clubs in dummy, so I would not make it so easy for him. 
Get out with a heart, a suit your partner is sure to have something in for the 3-level double, or shift to a heart after the @CA.

at|mitche: Bidding: I know East has just 14 hcp, but with a good 5 card suit, open 1NT.  
Sometimes you will get buried, but by and large, it pays off.  Bid this type of hand as a strong 1NT.  
For West.. @h963 is a bit thin to be a genuine @h stopper.   (1NT garuantees a @h-stopper here) 
So West has a manufactured 2@d bid -- yes, it is very heavy, but with depressing shape and 9 losers, it will do.  
And if East even breathes an invitation, West will have more than enough to accept.  4333 hands are very downgradeable.  
Anyway, West bid 1NT.  And now East, who kind of underbid, is stuck. A raise to 2NT shows about a king more than she 
actually has, so she has forced herself to pass.  A jump raise is still weak, but distributional.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: Anyway, 1@d (1@h) 2@D is also weak, a raise in competition here shows a bad hand.  
West has to lie, either by showing a limit raise in @D or a weak one.  
If West has anything other than 4333 shape, I bid the more aggressive limit raise (with a cue-bid of 2@h), but I hate that 
West hand for a strong bid.
WestElsdon: What about bidding 1NT with only 14 HCP - legal?  Even though card says 15-17?
mitche:  As for 1NT, East is close enough. You may bid 1 point outside your range.  So 1NT shows a very good 14 to a 
horrible 18.  Example of horrible 18:   @sQJ10   @hKQJ   @dKQJx  @cQJx

at|mitche:  Play:  After the 1@H overcall and 1NT  bid, North has a pretty decent hand.   But her partner already told her 
what to lead, and that is hearts.  Unless you have a very good reason to override partner's overcall, you generally 
will do better to lead the overcalled suit.  
If it doesn't work, your partner will be very forgiving, but if you don't lead his suit and it turns out badly for you, 
you will hear about it.  Here, a @h lead will hold declarer to 8 tricks.|

at|mitche:  Play:  @CK is the book lead here. 
Declarer won with @CA and on the 4th trick trumped with the @D4.  Next a high trump.
But then she should lead @h to dummy and when she regains the lead, a second heart to dummy, to finesse in diamonds.
Why?
First, East repeated the X over 2@d. With a second @D, she would be less inclined to repeat the X, vulnerable versus not.|

at|mitche: Bidding: Just as I would hope it should go.
South made a nice, disciplined pass, rather than rebidding 4@S - good, Azin!
Should North open 2@C?   Well, let's see.   He has a 4 loser hand, so it's pretty close.  I don't think the bidding will 
die at 1@h, so I am not worried that I will miss a game.  The unsupported Q in Qxx is not a 2 loser suit, so I count 4 
losers with a bit extra, but no, it's still a 4 loser hand.  
If you open this 2@c, the problem is the auction could be at 4@s before you get a second bid.  It really is a matter of 
style, I think.|

nt||cp|4|at|kat827: How did you know not to explore for slam?
mitche: The 4@h bid describes this hand.  I think South has to reckon that he covers 2 of declarer's 4 losers. 
So no slam.  (That is another reason not to open 2@C ... South will have a very hard time stopping at 4@h)  
Declarer counts 3 losers when he sees dummy.

at|mitche: Play: East made what is the best opening lead, as anything else will blow a trick immediately.  So what is the
best way to get to dummy?  Leading a @D is a straight 50-50 shot. If the @D loses, then he is sure to be held to 10 tricks (defense just plays another @D back).  

So let's look for a better line.  What happens if declarer plays the @CQ (after pulling all the trumps)?  If defense wins the @CK, then the @CJ is an entry and the @D's go away, so the defense must allow the @cQ to hold. |

at|mitche:  Next, the @CA and the third club.  If the @CK is either doubleton or tripleton, then the defense must lead either
a spade or diamond, and declarer's second @D loser vanishes.  
And if the K is with the long club, declarer still has the 50-50 chance of the @DA onside.  At 6@h, declarer has no choice 
but to lead toward the @DK.

at|mitche:  Bidding:   After 1@S, North should bid 1NT.  2@C shows something like 1-3-5-4 or maybe 1-4-4-4, 1-2-5-4 shape,
So with a balanced minimum and NT shape, just bid 1NT and get your hand off your chest.  

If North does bid 1NT, South should bid 2@C (new minor forcing or checkback, whichever are your agreements).  
2@C asks North to bid 2@H with 4 of them, 2@s with 3@S (and not 4 hearts), 2@D with 5 of them, 2NT with none of the above.  
So North would bid 2NT, and South will raise to 3NT.

at|mitche: Play: Declarer decided to win the first heart.  Good idea, since a @D shift will defeat him.  
Before cashing 3 clubs, declarer should try the effect of playing 3 rounds of spades.  
The contract makes when either black suit splits 3-3, but if spades are 3-3, you make overtricks.  
Incidentally, East should cash @C10 before shifting to a @D.
Finally, the heart position is kind of interesting.  West can discard 1 heart, but East cannot afford to discard any of
them.  If he does, the declarer can play the @h10 to pin his 9.|
