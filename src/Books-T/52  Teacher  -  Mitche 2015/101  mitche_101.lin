mn|Introduction|
fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back 
yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned SAYC, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."
Mitch Edelman aka mitche 


MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.
Thank you Eileen (wyoming33) for sending the hands and editing the chatlog! @h|

at|mitche:  Bidding:   Let's review what the NT bidder's response to a Jacoby transfer of 2@h should be. 
Opener looks at her spade suit.  If she has 2 or 3 spades, she bids 2@s.  
If she has 4 spades, she may SuperAccept,
if you use them. (I think you should.) But the first bid is to accept the transfer. This is not optional.  
So our auction should go 1NT, 2@h 2@s 3NT.  Then opener has to look at the rest of her hand.   
With 3 spades and a ruffing value, i.e. a doubleton, opener bids 4@s.
If opener is 3334, she looks at her honors. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  If they are "soft" values, i.e. kings, queens, and jacks, she may decide to play 3NT rather than to bid 4@s.  
So here, with just 1 Ace and a lot of soft values, East may decide to pass 3NT.

Responder is probably 5332 for 3NT (with a second suit and GF values, she might have bid her second suit).  
If East had accepted the transfer and then decided to bid 4@s, that would be OK 
(although here it would be really close, especially at IMPS, I would look for the 9-trick game).

at|mitche:  Play:  Declarer counts a @s, a @h, a @d, and 2 possible @c losers.  
So what can she do to get rid of one or two of those losers?
If only dummy had a doubleton club, then declarer could ruff out the clubs....  
So, rather than risking a club finesse, declarer should play a DIAMOND.  
And she should do this BEFORE she plays even 1 round of trumps.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt||at|When the @DK forces out the @DA, declarer can try to ditch a club from dummy on the @DJ in hand.  
Or at least set up the discard before playing trumps.
Turns out that the 4-1 split in spades makes things too hard here, but you can avoid going down 2 tricks.

at|mitche: Bidding: Transfer bids: West says "I have 5 spades" when she transfers, so East knows that they have a 9-card fit. 
And East has that magical ruffing value (shortness in clubs).
So when West says 3NT, it means, "pick the best game contract, either 3NT or 4@s."  Here, that would be 4@s. 
(A heart lead will defeat 3NT, by the way)
anniebmisc:  Would you super-accept? 
mitche:  Yes, I would.|

at|mitche:  Here is a question for you: Your hand is @sQxxx, @hKQxx, @dAx, @cA10x.
You open 1NT, 2@C by pard, 2@H by you, 3NT by pard.
Your bid?  4@s is right. Why?|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


at|
BILAsst10: Your pard didn't like your @H's so must have @S's else why bid Stayman.
mitche: Yep. If responder had no Major, she would have bid 3NT directly.
Point of question... you need to know what your bids mean, and Stayman means "I am looking for Major suit fit."
This auction is correct, even if you play that 2@C may deny a 4-card Major*.|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt||at|
(MM: *Playing 4-way transfers, the 2@C could have been a preparation to rebid the 2NT invitational hand next..
1NT - 2@c / 2x - 2NT   In 4-way the 2@c bid    "asks but does not promise" 
(Responder could not bid 2NT DIRECTLY, 1NT - 2NT, as that would have been a transfer to @d)
but since responder rebids 3NT next, it is very clear that responder does NOT have this invitational hand, 
and therefore MUST have a 4-card @s       2@c clearly was good old Stayman  )

at|mitche: Play: When the @D10 holds the first trick, declarer should realize that the @DQ is odds on to be in South. 
The rule of 11 makes it pretty clear that South has the @DQ.   (11 - 4 = 7 )
The opening lead was the @D4, meaning 7 cards higher than the 4 in the other 3 hands.
You see 6 between your hand and dummy, so know North has at most 1 card higher than the 4, 
and it got played on the second round of the suit (the @d7)|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: At 3NT, declarer just leaves the fragile heart suit completely alone.
(who touches that suit first is very likely to give away a trick)  
She gets to hand with either a diamond or the @cAce 
(best is to win the first @D in hand with the @dJack) and then finesse in spades.|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: When the @sK shows up offside, declarer has 9 sure tricks.  She just gives up a diamond and that's that.
Perfect defense beats 4@s, of course, but a good declarer will not allow them to find perfect defense.

MM: By clicking on the cards, you can play the hand Double Dummy. Try the @h-lead :)

at|mitche:  Bidding:  South had a choice of either 2@s or a negative X of 2@h.
With 10 HCP and a 5-card spade suit (and 3 card support for diamonds), 2@s might have been the winning bid.  
If the spades were better, say @sK109xx, then I would have bid 2@s.  But as it is, I think X would work out OK.|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


at|
West, if you are going to bid 3@h over 3@d, then bid it immediately.   East bid 2@h to jam the N/S auction. 
When West takes his time bidding 3@h (meaning not immediately but later), he gives the other side a "fielder's choice" - 
they can either double or bid on, after having had more time to discuss their hands.|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |

mitche:  So if you are going to preempt, go as high as you dare as fast as you can, and then stop bidding.
Do not hold a bid in reserve. It is losing bridge.

at|mitche: Play:  When declarer won the @DA, East played the Jack. 
Declarer should now cross to dummy with a club (safe, since East would need 11 cards in clubs and hearts for this to 
get ruffed) and finesse the @D10.  Why?|
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


at|  
Believe it or not, the odds are 2 to 1 that the finesse will work. 
If you want to see detailed reasoning, google    "restricted choice."
The basic idea is that if East has the @DQJ doubleton, he could play either one at random. 
They are both equals, so it doesn't matter which one he plays.|
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  But when he plays the J, it is a forced play.  Putting it a different way, the odds are 50-50 that she 
would play the J from QJ and 100% that she would play the Jack from singleton Jack.  So that means the odds are 
2:1 that she started with the singleton J  vs   QJ       which makes the finesse right.|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


at|
Especially given that East has known heart length, the finesse is really the best play.
If East has 6 hearts, there are 7 unknown cards in her hand, and West has 3 hearts, hence 10 unknown cards in his. 
So the odds favor the @DQ to be with West either way you analyze the  hand.|
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Restricted choice extends to other situations, too, not just finessing against a Queen or Jack. 
Ken Lebensohl wrote a column many years ago, called "odd bridge" that has a restricted choice problem with odds of near
9 to 1.  Most importantly, it applies in situations where someone leads small from 4 or 5 in a suit and an honor 
shows up in third hand.  
Bridge logic says that the opening leader will have any honor lower in rank than the one third hand plays, but higher 
cards are easy to locate if you apply restricted choice to the distribution of the remaining honors higher 
than the one shown by third hand.|

a) With 6 HCP including an Ace, East should bid, and 1NT is the book bid here.
b) South has a book balancing 1NT, which shows 11-14 HCP and a good spade stopper.
c) If East bids 1NT, South should pass quietly.

Even with a good hand, you need a good suit to come in freely at the 2 level, and lacking hearts (the unbid Major), 
South should not think about doubling 1NT, which, by the way, is a takeout double of spades.

at|mitche: Bidding:  When the bidding comes around to West the second time, he should double again.  
If the first double was takeout, so is the second double.  
If North rebids a red suit at the 3-level, West can then bid 3@S, which shows a massive hand.  
Or West, needing not much more than 3 spades and either the @CQ or a doubleton, might try 4@S anyway.  
If North passes the second double: 
a) South should get a new partner, and 
b) East bids 3@S.              And West should then bid 4@s.|

at|mitche:  West's strong Spades should take a shot, I think, especially at IMPS.  
If you can make game with just 1 good card from partner, bid it. 
dee_dee_20:  Should north open 1@h or 1@d?
mitche:  North hand should open 1@h - on East Coast.  
It's very common in that area to open 1 of a Major with 5 of the Major and 6 of a minor.  
I would bid 3@d over the balancing double (North is pretty sure that E/W have spades, so take away bidding room).|
pg| ***** 117 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  However, in places that don't use Washington Standard (Steve Robinson's version of 2 over 1), 
a lot of people will want to start 1@d and rebid hearts twice.
Turns out that N/S cannot afford to take a save over 4@s (5@h or 5@d doubled goes for 500).
So I would jump to 3@d to squeeze out as much bidding space as possible from EW

at|mitche: Play:  West can expect trumps not to behave well.  North must have a distributional hand to rebid @D at the 3 
level with at most 15 HCP.  So after the defense begins with the @HAK and @DK, he should:  
 - play 3 rounds of trumps ending in dummy, 
 - pitch the losing diamond on the good heart, 
 - finesse in clubs.
If the finesse wins, declarer takes 11 tricks.
If not, then he can still ruff a club in dummy for his 10th and game-fulfilling trick.|
pg| ***** 135 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  When South ruffs from 3 trumps, declarer properly discarded the @D loser, and now he can ruff 2 small 
clubs in dummy to make the contract.

at|mitche:  Bidding:  South's best course of action is to pass 1@h.  If he feels he must bid, then 1NT is probably better.  
But with a flat hand and no defense, pass.
If N/S play that 1@d promises 4 of them, then 2@d might be OK.  But if they do play that way, their CC should say so. 
Either way, bidding 3@D on the South hand is taking your life in your hands. 
You could be on a 4-3 fit with 19 HCP between you.|

at|mitche: Play: East correctly avoided leading either Major and the defense got its 5 tricks.
If North guesses to play the @DA instead of leading small, I think the defense will prevail.  
If declarer pulls all the trumps, she loses an extra spade, and if not, she loses an extra trump.
BILAsst10: Will 2@Hs make?
mitche:  2@Hs?  Well, let's see.  Declarer should plan to take a club, the spade A, and play on cross ruff lines, 
but trumps from the defense kill that, so I think 2@h will go down 1, maybe 2 if declarer slips.|
pg| ***** 153 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  If the defense leads spades, declarer might get very lucky, but apart from that .... No, I think 2@h is failing.
btour:  Makes 2@H unless small club lead I think.
mitche:  Don't think it matters, Bob, declarer always loses 2@C, 1@d, 2@S, trump.

at|mitche: Bidding:  The bidding was about right.  North might have tried a negative X over 2@C, since a 4-4 spade fit 
would be nice to find, if N/S had one.  
But raising partner's suit is a very good idea, too.  When South bid 3@h, no one had anything else to say.

at|mitch: Play: After West cashes 2 clubs, she shifted to a spade, which is the right play. West has 2 sure trumps, 
and the only hope for another is either the @DA or @SK. If the defense has the @DA, it cannot run away, but if East has 
the @SK, it's better to set that up as soon as possible.

MM: You can play the hand Double Dummy if you wish
