fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back 
yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned SAYC, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

tu||
fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f 4-way transfers  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|^b@2mitche: We all know that after 1NT opener, 2@d and 2@h are transfer bids to get the NT opener 
to be declarer.
But think about these problem hands: 

@sx, @hxxx,  @dQ109xxx, @cxxx and 
@Sx, @hAKx, @dAJ10xxx, @cKQx.

With the first hand, you want to play 3@d, and the second one might belong in 6 or 7 diamonds.
How can we deal with these 2 problems?  The answer is transfer bids, of course.

Here is the idea.  
We use 2@s as a transfer to 3@C and 
2NT as a transfer to 3@d.
The NT bidder doesn't know if responder has a good or terrible hand.  He will find out eventually.

Rule 1 of minor suit transfers - Notice that you have a bid in between the transfer bid and the transfer suit.  
After 2@S, opener can bid either 2NT or 3@c.
So when opener has good support for the transfer suit (after 2@S, that's @C) he uses the in-between bid (here, 2NT) to 
show 3-card support with an honor A,K,Q  (preaccepts); 
without good support (3 to a high honor), he just bids the transfer suit.  
(In between bids are 2NT over 2@S and 3@C over 2NT.)

So for example, the 1NT opener has @sKJ10x, @hAxxx, @dKQx, @cKx and hears 2@S. 
He bids 3@C because he does NOT have 3 to an honor.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||

cp|2|ht|c|3d|3|at|^b@2This is important, because when opener "preaccepts", responder can bid 3NT with 6 clubs to an honor,
hoping to run the suit.
Example:  Opener bids 1NT, responder has: 
@sQx, @hxx, @dKJ10xxx, @cJxx and bids 2NT over 1NT, transferring to @D.
If opener bids 3@c (the "preaccept bid"), responder might bid 3NT, hoping to produce 6 diamond tricks.
But responder can also sign off in 3 of a minor with a hopeless hand, something like:  @sx   @hxxx   @dQ109xxx   @cxxx

What happens when responder has hand 2, that monster:  @Sx   @hAKx   @dAJ10xxx   @cKQx?

He still bids 2NT over 1NT and whether or not opener bids 3@C or 3@D, responder bids 3@h. 
That says: "Game forcing, and I have a heart control."
Opener can now show a control  - 3@S, 4@c or even 4@d to show doubleton honor or 3 small.
(There are better uses for 4@d, but that would be way too much for tonite.)

Anyway, the idea is that responder either passes, bids a natural 3NT after the transfer to show a mildly slammish 
hand or a control bid to show a really good one.

Practice time:  

You have @sxx, @hAxx, @dKQJxx, @cxxx and partner bids 1NT - what do you do?|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at|
This is a simple problem - you bid 3NT.. balanced hand, 10 points    (the transfer shows 6 card minor)

So how does responder bid an invitational hand?  
If 2NT now means @D transfer, how do you bid that "2NT" hand if you happen to have one?|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|
You use STAYMAN either with or without a 4-card Major.  If you have a 4-card Major, no problem, you bid as normal.
If you don't, you just rebid 2NT over opener's response.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|
^b@2|at|If responder does have 4 spades after 2@c and opener bids 2@h, then responder should bid 2@S 
( information partner receives is: I was bidding the normal Stayman, asking for a Major) 
Opener bids 2@h with both majors (= up the line) => if responder has spades, he bids 2@S and if he doesn't, he bids 2NT.

The auction 1NT-2@C / 2@H-3NT denies a 4-card Major in responder's hand and shows GF points.
As long as opener bids 2@h with both majors, you cannot get it wrong.
When playing 4-way XFR, responder shows his 4-card @S suit by bidding them over 2@h.

masse24: With a GF hand, do you run the risk that opener can pass 2@S?
mitche:  If you want to play 3@S as GF, then you may.. but 2@S shows spades after 2@h and 2NT denies them.
I find it convenient to treat 2@S over 2@h as FORCING 1 ROUND so opener will raise to 3 with 4-4 in the majors 
or bid 2NT without 4 spades.

So what happened to invitational 2NT?  Remember that Stayman shows at least invitational values, so if you have a 4-4 
spade fit, you are safe at the 3 level with 15 HCP opposite 8+ or 9 HCP.
You use STAYMAN either with or without a 4-card Major.   If you have a 4-card Major, no problem, you bid as normal.
If you don't you just bid 2NT over opener's response. 
Let's summarize: After 1NT  2@c

Opener rebids 2@D
a) Responder bids 2NT with or without a major
b) Responder bids his 4-card Major, to show 5-4 in the Majors (2-level invite or 3-level GF Smolen
   or the variation: bid your 5-card at the 2-level, your 4-card at the 3-level.  Agree with P)
c) Responder bids 3NT: responder has 1 major

Opener rebids 2@h
a) responder bids 2@s with 4 spades
b) responder bids 2NT without a Major (invitational)
c) Responder bid 3NT which promises 4 spades|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||
cp|2|ht|c|3d|3|at|^b@2Opener bids 2@s
a) Responder bids 2NT (may or may not have hearts) invitational
b) Responder bids 3NT which guarantees hearts
Reasoning: 
If, after Stayman 2@c, responder bids 3NT he must have a major, else he would bid 3NT directly over 1NT.

A further note: When the auction is 1NT - 2@c / 2@h (or 2@s) - 2NT, opener may still have a 5-card Major.
If opener rebids 3@h (or 3@s), it shows   "not minimum and 5-card suit"  
Responder should treat this as game-going and choose between 3NT or 4 of opener's Major.

ecolodge:  Question with 1NT-2NT:  How does opener know if this is a transfer to @D or just a weak, flat NT response?
mitche:  It is always a transfer to @D if you are playing 4-way transfers.  With weak flat hand, you pass 1NT.
With invitational flat hand, you go thru Stayman.  
And with strong flat hand, you bid 3NT or more (if you want to invite slam).

So the XFR allows you to sign off with a dog in 3 of a minor (6-card suit, probably fewer than 7 points).
NOTE:  If you have 7 or 8 points and a 6-card minor, I recommend passing because 1NT +1 
scores better than 3@C =
This is important for match point players.  That 8 point minor is something like Qxxxxx with an outside KQ or so. 

Example:  @sJxx   @hAx   @dxx   @cQ10xxxx     just passes 1NT and takes its chances .  
But  @sx   @hxx   @dxxx   @cQ10xxxxx          does not let opener struggle in 1NT and thus transfers to clubs.

OK, let's play some bridge!

Someone asked if @CQ was best lead.  I think so.  When nature gives you a 3 card honor sequence, other things being equal, you should lead it.
"Other things" are the contract, whether the suit is a major or a minor, and the bidding.

at|mitche: Bidding:  A case can be made for doubling with North cards instead of 1NT.
Here is why:  
a) support for the Majors (yes, you want a 4th spade, but..)  
b) the @DAK are nice cards, but they give you no flexibility in the play, like ducking, should you get to 3NT.

Here's the case for 1NT:  Good 15 HCP, double stop in @D, and balanced. 
I would X to get the Majors into the conversation.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  If you play "systems on" over 1NT overcalls, then South has a way to show 5-4 in the Majors.
It's "Smolen" - here is how it works
South bids 2@C over 1NT - Stayman.
North bids 2@H and N/S get to 4@h, a better contract than 4@s.
But if North bids 2@d (no 4-card Major), South would show 5 of one major and 4 of the other with Game Force strength 
by bidding her 4-card Major (@h here) at the 3-level ( = a jump, showing 5-4).
Then North, the NT bidder, can pick either 3NT or a possible 5-3 fit or even a 4-3 fit, if that looks right.|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  This is a good convention because it doesn't conflict with anything else.
Well, it starts with 2@C stayman.
CarlieG:   Doesn't 1NT accomplish the same as X?
mitche:  I like the X, Carlie, because of the @D shortness. 
1NT tends to deny both majors.  You can argue that 4-3 is not both majors, but I think I want to double anyway.
|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: IN THE ACTUAL  auction, South transferred into spades and then raised to 3. 
That auction shows 6 spades and invitational (around 9 points) strength.  
So South has not enough spades and too much strength.|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


at|
Transferring w/5 card suit is fine, but when you have 5-4 in the majors, you want to find a fit in either one, 
if you have one, which is why Smolen is so useful. 
And you generally wish to play in your 4-4 fit, not your 5-3 fit. BECAUSE: the 5-3 fit will generate a discard or 2, 
and the 4-4 fit allows you to make either hand the "master hand."|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Now, one other question:  should North have raised 3@S to 4, assuming South has an invitational hand?
North counts 15 HCP and 1 more for the doubleton, so it's close.   At IMPS, I think 4@S is right. 
calligal: The distribution took us down.
mitche:  The 4-1 split in both majors were unfriendly, yes.

at|mitche: Bidding:   First, I think that you want to play transfer bids, including transfers to 3 of a minor.
If you do not, you have to discuss how to handle weak hands with long minors.
Without agreement, you are sailing without a compass or rudder, so who knows if 3@D here is weak or strong? 
I surely do not.
The majority would probably treat 3@d as weak,
If you do not play 3@D as weak, then you need to start with 2@C and bid 3@d over anything opener says.
So I suggest 4 suit transfers.|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Be all that as it may be, South should reason as follows:  
"I have 10 points and a sort-of balanced looking hand, so I will just bid 3NT and hope we don't miss 6@d."

We do not like to be in 5 of a minor, unless we can't play 3NT.

at|mitche: Bidding:   When you get to a silly contract, and 3NT is a silly contract, there  is usually a bidding mistake.
Let's look at the auction bid by bid. 
1@d is probably OK.  But this hand might also bid a large number of @D as a preempt as West has no defense against a Major suit contract.     After 1@D,   2@C strikes me as timid.

I'd preempt with at least 3 and even better, 4@c because North has no defense.  
And with a 7-card suit, it is really hard for the other side to double.|
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  - 2@s --  Over 2@c, a negative X might get some votes, and so would 2@S 
but ask what East's second bid might be over 3@d...    3@h?   4@h?   pass??? 
East's best course is to double negatively and bid 2@h over 2@d
3NT without a club stopper, however, is not a good idea. The auction might go 1@D 4@c and East would have 
a serious problem now.  If East were to double 4@c, it should not be penalty, but "do something clever, pard" and West 
should probably pull to 4@d.|
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So 4@d might be the final contract, and that might make.  If North begins with 2 rounds of @C, the 
contract is on.  And 4@d fails if North plays anything but a third round of @C.
You cannot judge whether a bid is right or wrong by the result it produces.

You have to bid what you expect to work best - and here, after an opening of 1@d, North needs to jam the auction.
Anyway please remember, all of you.  The idea is not to get the best result possible on a hand, but to make the bid most 
likely to give you a good result, especially on freak hands.

at|mitche: Play:  East was hoping, I think, to con South into playing a third heart. 
But with the @C suit wide open, East might try to cash his 8 winners and hope that a spade or heart materializes 
on discards.  Now, should South lead a club?
I don't particularly mind the @HK opening lead, as it rates to set up 3 hearts and the @SA plus partner's eventual club 
winner.  After all, East promised a stopper there.
One last point: after North runs his clubs, he should shift to a spade. |
pg| ***** 98 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  South should help him by discarding the @S9 and then a low one.  How should North know to shift to a @S?
If South had the @HAKQ, then surely she would have cashed them in a different order and she would have cashed 
all 3 of them before playing the club.

at|mitche: Bidding:  I think that North intended 3@C as a Bergen raise.
But the problem with Bergen raises after a third-seat opening is that third seat opening might be on vapor.
South could have opened 1@S without the @DA for example, and then even 3@S could be in trouble.  
So we prefer to use DRURY.
And "2-way reverse" Drury is pretty common.|
pg| ***** 103 ***** |


at|
After a pass and third seat 1@h or 1@S, responder bids 2@c to show 10 dummy points and 3-card support, 
2@D with 4-card support and 10 dummy points.|
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: If opener had a subminimum hand, she rebids her Major and you avoid the 3-level on 10 opposite 10 HCP.
If 3@c is preemptive, then South should probably pass, but if she thinks 3@C shows just below an opening hand with 6 
clubs she certainly has a 5@C bid.
I guess she thought 3@c was a goodish hand.

at|mitche: Play:  West led a heart, but the 6 spot.  Here, the @HQ is correct .
At NT you would like a nearly solid (QJ9 or KQ10) sequence to lead an honor, but at suit contracts, QJ8xx is good enough 
for the Q.
Because of the lucky  positions of the black kings, the contract always makes, but a low heart blew a trick as it turned out.

at|mitche:  Bidding:   The balancing X by North was a good idea, showing 5 hearts and support for either of the other 
suits - (not @S, of course), so South could bid 3@c with short hearts and long clubs.

South bids 3@h, showing a bad hand.
North needs about 14-15 working points for the balancing X here, and South should bid game with about 9 dummy points.

at|mitche: Play: First, underleading an ace in a side suit at a trump contract is almost never correct. So don't do it!
Butler39:  What should have been lead?
mitche:  With the East hand, either the @DQ or @C9 would be OK, but a small spade is out.
So write this down 50 times: "I will never under lead a side-suit ace at a trump contract."
Now, declarer has 2 spades, a trump, and 2 diamonds to lose.
He got away with it when the defenders got their @D winners tangled up.|
pg| ***** 131 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: The defense can do better by playing 3 rounds of spades and allowing declarer to figure out how to play
diamonds himself.

MM: You can play the hand Double Dummy if you wish.
This concludes this presentation, hope you enjoyed, Karen10 & GG_Bridge
