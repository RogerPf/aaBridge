fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned SAYC, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."
Mitch Edelman aka "mitche" 


MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.
Thank you Eileen (wyoming33) for sending the hands and editing the chatlog! @h

at|mitche: Bidding:   
a) 4@s shows about 20 dummy points, and it's the book bid with East's hand;
b) West counts 33  or so points and is interested in slam, so some move is needed....4NT isn’t the move.
MrsD12345:  Would one not show a second suit?  
mitche:  No, there is no need to show a second suit, because E/W have found an 8-card Major fit.
Why isn’t Blackwood a great idea with the West hand?|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|  
East could have @SAK and no diamond control.  So better is west bidding 5@C, a control bid, looking for slam.  |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  If West shows the @CA, then East can bid 5@d. West should then just bid 6@s.  
West knows that East cannot have enough stuff for a grand slam, so 6@S is a good parking place.
MrsD12345:  Only Aces at this level?|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


at|
mitche:  Well, here is the rule of thumb for "Italian cue bids."  
If you have found a fit and are in a GF auction, then a new suit shows a control. If the control bid is BELOW gamelevel, 
it shows first or second round control, Ace, King, or singleton (or void) -- you bid the cheapest control you have. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  For example, let's pretend for the moment that 3@S by East were Game Forcing 
(yes, I know it isn't, but let's assume it is for the sake of discussion). 
Then West could bid 4@C and it would show the @CA or @CK.    If East were to bid 4@h here, showing a @H control, 
(skipping the @d-suit), West would KNOW that diamonds were wide open and could just stop at 4@s.
When East bids 4@d, West could then bid 4@h, showing a heart control.    East knows that West has stuff in @C and @H 
and East could then bid 4NT, get the info that E/W are off a control and bid 6. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: I recommend you read Marty Bergen's "Slam Bidding Made Easy" and read up on Italian Cue Bids.  
They really help in bidding slam.

at|mitche: Play: West takes the spade finesse first, and when it loses, she should finish trumps before playing on diamonds.
Why?|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


at|
Suppose the @D finesse loses, but North had a doubleton heart.  Then West goes down 2 instead of down 1.
If trumps are 4-1, then there's no heart ruff, and declarer can (once again) finish trumps before taking the @D hook.|

sk||
at|mitche: Bidding:  After 2@h by East, West may as well just bid 4@h. East has shown a 6 bagger with a minimum hand,
so despite her 15 HCP, West can guess that slam is out.
CarlieG:  Can 2@H show 5 cards?
mitche:  2@h should be a 6 bagger, I think. The default bid with 5332 is 2NT. If East has 2 bad spades and just 5 hearts,
she either has 3-card @D support and raises diamonds or 4 clubs and bids 3@C.
(MM: This is a partnership agreement, for others rebidding the Major is the default bid)|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  I do not mind bidding 2NT with 3 small cards in a side suit, but an empty doubleton (especially spades)  
is a warning sign not to look for NT.
WestElsdon:  Could/should North double on first bid?
mitche:  I think North should pass because -- 
a) the opponents are in a GF auction and 
b) Our side rates to be very outgunned.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  At Matchpoints, maybe.
But at IMPS, it is very risky to get into a live auction with length in one of the opponents suits and few HCP 
You have heard me use the term "death holding" to describe 3 small cards in a suit the opps have bid but haven't raised. North's hand has that problem.
So no, North should not X -- especially vul.

at|mitche: Play: East raised @D, so E/W have at least a 7-card fit in @D, right?  
South can reason that North has at most 1 diamond and possibly none.  
This leads to trying this defense: @DA, @D ruff, @SA, spade.
Now, declarer will still make the hand but this might be the best chance to defeat 4@h.|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt||at|
If your opponents are trustworthy, this defense seems appropriate.  
The hand is cold even if South finds a club lead.  
Declarer then loses just 1 club, 1@D and the @SA.
One point of play: 
In the end game, South won the second diamond. She should win the third diamond and get out with a club. |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Declarer then can set up a diamond but not get to dummy to cash it.  
If declarer anticipates this problem, she can try discarding clubs from dummy and leading the @SK out of hand to try to
create an entry to dummy. |
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


at|
One last point, I prefer the @S9 as an opening lead.  Declarer has an outside suit that is likely to produce discards, 
and @D tricks are not going away. So if you don’t lead the @DA, then a spade makes sense.

SK||

at|mitche: Bidding:  South may pretend that one of her minor suit cards was a major and tell a little 
white lie opening 1NT. Some of you might think that is heresy, but this hand looks very much like it wants to be 
opened 1NT.
If South does open 1NT, N/S will get to 4@h with alacrity with a transfer sequence. By the way, I would, if my 
convention card included it, use a Texas transfer to get to 4@h.
After all, N/S want to be in game, but North has no interest in slam unless South has the perfect maximum.  
It pays on balance not to look for that miracle fit.|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  What should West do over 2@C?|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


at| 
If the game were matchpoints, I would bid 2@s over 2@c.  
At IMPS, 2@S is more a risk but at Matchpoints, I will try to steal.
ecolodge:  Mitch, is there a HCP minimum for a Texas transfer?
mitche:  You have -
a) 6+ cards in your major and      b) about 10 - 12 points.
With a stronger hand and 6-card Major, use a Jacoby transfer and jump to 4. That then is slam-invitational.|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Using texas allows you to get to 4@H and not get pard excited.

One exception: 1NT - 4@d/ 4@h - 4NT is Blackwood as there is a KNOWN fit 
but 1NT - 2@h/ 2@s - 4NT is QUANTITATIVE - same point count as 1NT - 4NT, but with a 5-card @H suit.

sk||

at|mitche: Bidding:  EAST has a hand on which it is correct to bid both her suits.  
If her hand were weaker (say less than 11 or 12) or stronger (say 16+), then she could bid 2@h, Michaels cue bid.  
But in that 12-15 point range, it is better to bid both of your suits, so partner will have a better idea of your strength.|
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


at|
I also think that North has a good enough hand to bid 2@d over 1NT, rather than passing.  
South bid 1NT freely, so he rates to be better than a poor 6 or 7 points.  
With a good 7 or more, North doesn’t have to worry that the 2-level is too rich.|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


nt||
at|BILAsst10: If North does bid 2@D what should East do?
mitche:  If North bids 2@d, East will have to bid 3@C to show her second suit, which she may or may not do.  
If E/W walk into the 3-level, they should get doubled.  
East may feel brave and bid 3@c, but the NT bid on her left should caution her about going on.
So E/W found 2@s
ecolodge:  If North bids 2@D, does South pass or raise?
mitche:  South should raise 2@d to 3, and that should end the auction.

at|mitche: Play:  South led the @h8.
North can now see all the spots higher than the 8: 9 in hand, J10 in dummy, and KQ in her hand.  East is marked with 
the @HA and the only other @h she cannot see is the 2.  So North can play the 6 under the 8, and East's Ace 
falls on air.

The @h suit in dummy is dead (of course) because dummy is entryless... but it doesn’t hurt to work these details out.
On some other hand, you may not wish to play an honor that would allow declarer to set up a suit.|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  When North came in with her @CK at trick 3, she got out with a @h and East ruffed.  That turns out to be 
the best defense, because declarer's trumps are getting shortened. One more ruff and the defenders will
have control of the hand.  (This is why the @hK at trick 1 was bad.)

The important lessons here: 
Watch the spots and when you, as defender, know trumps are splitting badly for declarer, look for ways to make 
declarer ruff in the long hand. (= the forcing game)|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Best defense will beat 2@s at least 2 tricks, and I think that down 3 is not impossible.
jonnyquest: With South's 1NT bid, and dummy being out of @C's, it seems that declarer intends to ruff some @C's in dummy. 
Wouldn't a trump at trick 4 be better?
mitche:  I thought about that, but a trump will not stop the @C ruff. 
jonnyquest: Will stop 2.
mitche:  Well, 2 was doomed anyway..and the @C suit sets up with just 1 ruff.|

sk||
at|mitche: Bidding:  1@h was a thin opening bid, I think, but not unreasonable.  Double by West was rather offbeat.
In fact, it was very offbeat. A second-seat double of opener's bid is one of 2 types of hands:  
a) a takeout double, showing shortness in opener's suit and support for the other 3, or 
b) a hand too strong to make a simple overcall, usually about 18+ points. 

West had neither of those holdings, so she has a pass.  
Yes, she has 13 HCP, but sometimes you just have no action you can take, and this is one of them.|

mitche:  I might, but I think the suit is kind of ragged. I will get a chance later to balance or bid.  
When the auction dies at 2@h or 2@s, I can come in or pard can balance with a double. 
ecolodge:  If not vul, would you consider a white lie and bid 2NT, unusual, with West hand?

mitche:  I would consider it, yes, and I might even do it.  If the hand has compensating advantages.|

at|mitche:  I might bid 2NT with 5-4 in the minors. Compensating advantages are good suit texture, like KJ10xx, AQ98. 
I think that 2NT here at this vulnerability is a bit rich, since I will be asking pard to bid at the 3-level on what could 
be a very poorly-fitting hand.
So 2NT would be fine nonvul, and especially with favorable vulnerability.
ecolodge:  So better to hope the auction dies at 2@H or 2@S and get in at that point?  And with W's strength, it might. 
mitche:  And if N/S do get to the 3 level, they won't like the way the play develops.
Paradoxically it is safer for West to get in later than earlier.

at|mitche: Play:  West has a hard hand to lead from.  At the table, I might lead a trump, rather than risk blowing a trick
by leading a diamond.

On this hand a trump to the ace and club switch net 4 fast tricks for the defense, and they cannot be stopped from at 
least 2 others.  Declarer will not know how to attack spades and diamonds. South probably won't get everything right. 
It's a hard hand to play, Tom.|

at|mitche: Next week, I want to look at some material a friend of mine produced on opening leads vs No Trump.  
It is based on the book by David Bird  "Opening Leads against NT" (or something close to that).

Thanks to Eileen for her generous assistance and to all of you for your courteous attention and participation.

MM: You can play the hand Double Dummy if you wish
This concludes this presentation, hope you enjoyed, Karen10 & GG_Bridge|
