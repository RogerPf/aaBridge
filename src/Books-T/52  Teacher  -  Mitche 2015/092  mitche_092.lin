fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned SAYC, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."
Mitch Edelman aka mitche 


MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.
Thank you Eileen (wyoming33) for sending the hands and editing the chatlog! @h

|at|mitche: Bidding: North's opening pass, rather than a 2@d bid, was because she has 4 hearts.  I think that is generally a good idea.  When you preempt in a minor, you are pretty much guaranteeing no support for an unbid Major.
The disadvantage of that is you never get to bid your suit. 
Here, bidding 2@d over 1NT is a risky proposition, you do not want to get in at the 2 level with 2 bidding opponents and a passed partner without a very good reason.  
You may abuse matchpoints with a 2@d bid over 1NT, but at IMPS, you are risking giving away 500 on a part score deal.
So North pretty much had to pass again.  |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: Now, East's first instinct was to bid 2@C over 1NT -- a good bid.
If West has 3 hearts, you want to be in 4@h.
Also, after the NMF 2@C (New Minor Forcing Convention), West was correct to raise to 3@c, showing her 4-card support. 
East can then bid 3NT if she likes. 
(MM: As 2@c is totally artificial... 3@c should force to 3NT, therefore 3@c is a "positive" response
When opener is minimal (not willing to go to game opposite an invite, either 2@d or 2NT are the negative bids)

at|mitche: Play: The best lead from AKJ10x is not the Ace, unless you specifically play that the Ace versus NT demands 
partner to drop an honor.  If you don't play that Ace demands an unblocking card, then you should lead the K.
As third seat, if partner leads an honor and you have the one directly below it (they lead Ace versus NT and you have 
the King, or they lead King and you have Queen), you MUST drop the honor.
See what happens if South had the @DQ and doesn’t play it.  North is guaranteed to shift.  
And N/S would miss their chance to run 5 diamonds off the top.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  At trick 2, North shifted.
It is a pretty bad idea to shift to a suit that declarer would like to establish.
North can work out that South has spades. How?|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


at|

If West had 4 spades, what would she have bid over 1@h? 
Since West did not bid 1@s, she has at most 3 of them.  And that means South has at least 5 of them.  
So a spade at trick 2 is the best defense.  A club is going to work here, but it's usually a better idea to try to set up your long suits on defense than to hope partner has a  strong holding from a shorter suit.|

|sk||
at|mitche: Bidding:  Let's ask what 2@h should mean in this auction. 
The bid is usually "Non-forcing, constructive", i.e. about 9 or 10 points, a good suit, and a doubleton or so in 
over caller's suit.  

So North is close to that, and 2@h is a bit pushy (give North the @CJ, and 2@h would be a better idea).
Just remember that when advancer bids a new suit over over-caller's, it shows a hand that can tolerate playing at 
the 3-level. |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: That means that South could have bid 3@h over 2@s (or, if South passed, North could have bid 3@d over 2@s).
calligal: Since I did not have an honor in @d's, I thought it better to show 5 hearts, although HCP's were low.
mitche: The problem with showing hearts on a bad hand is you may wind up playing a heart contract on a bad hand at 
unfavorable vulnerability.

So it's best to be a little less brave here.  Also, when you have a fit (1097 is a good fit for partner's overcalled suit),
you generally are happy to play in that suit.|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt||
at|calligal: I should have supported diamonds?
mitche:  Yes, if not directly, then over 2@s.

at|mitche: Play at 2@S:  The opening lead was the @H2, low from this holding. 
Since North cannot be sure that South has the J9, she should play the @HQ.
When the @hQueen holds, North should shift to the @D10  
This is likely to be the last time North is on lead, and partner bid diamonds. Help her out!!
When the @DK and ace are played, South will then play another heart.
So defense will be able to cash their tricks and wait for declarer to give them the 2 clubs they are entitled to.|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  What 2 clubs???  Back when the defense cashed its diamond and heart winners, they got out with a second diamond. 
Then they can lock declarer in her hand to lead away from the @CA10.
One club discard from declarer's hand does her no good at all.

Defense on that hand is not the easiest, but the key: diamond shift at trick 2, diamond continuation is clear. 
Declarer can't have any good discard on @DQ.|

SK||

at|mitche: Bidding:  I would not be bidding 2@h with the West hand as a second seat vulnerable overcall.
That bid will get you clobbered more often than it works. West has about a 9 loser hand (8 1/2 if you think the @CQ has a fighting chance to win a trick).
And you may wind up going down 2 without the defenders breathing hard... doubled.
If your partner can be counted on to balance, don’t bid a WJO with junk at these colors--it is losing bridge.
Next: North certainly has the values for a bid over 2@h.
But 2@S absolutely promises at least 5 of them here. Why?  We play negative doubles.|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So North can make a negative X and she can find a bid over anything South says.  If no spade fit is found, 
then 3NT (or possibly 5@D) should be making.
Here's the negative double pattern: your partner opens something (1 plum) and your RHO overcalls something else 
(1 grape or maybe 2 grapes).  If you have 4 of an unbid major and the right point count, you double.  Example: 1@c  
(1@h) X shows 4 spades; but 1@C (1@h) 1@s promises 5+ spades.  A negative X that allows opener to bid at the 1-level 
promises about 6+ points.|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  A negative X that forces a bid at the 2-level promises about 8-9 points, e.g. 1@s (2@C) X promises 4 hearts 
and about 8 or 9 (+) HCP.  But 1@S (2@C) 2@h promises the same 9+ points, with 5+ hearts.

at|mitche: Bidding:  West's 2@c was the drury convention 
I would prefer 2@d to show 4-card support, but the point is that the 2@c bid showed heart support.  
If East now says 2@h, it means "not interested in game."
So 3@c meant "good clubs and enough to play in game."

West's next bid might be 3@d to show a control (A or K) in diamonds.  But she bid 4@h which should end the auction. 
RULE: when a passed hand jumps to game in a GF auction (3@c says we are going to game) that hand has nothing extra 
to show.|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So East, with a club and 2 diamonds to lose should just pass 4@h.
Now, after East bid 4@s, I think West's 5@d is probably OK. Since she showed her minimum, the 5@d cannot be the ace.  
(Remember, West would have bid 3@d with the ace, and she should have bid it anyway, with the K.)

North's double of 5@d asked partner to lead a diamond, by the way.  I think she needs a bit more than @dAJ tight to 
double, but it could here have been the winning bid.
BILAsst10:  Cuebidding above game - showing the King not the Ace?|
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  If E/W had been in a cue-bidding sequence, then it would have promised the Ace, since 5@d was 
above game level.  
But here, E/W have committed to the 5 level, and the bid is unambiguously not the ace. 

The problem was that West should have bid 3@d instead of 4@h.  Then she would have bid 5@h over 4@s.  
And East would know the @DA was missing.

at|mitche: Play:  What was the opening lead?   The @D7
From the good, old-fashioned rule of 11, North knows that if the seven is 4th best, 
declarer cannot have a card higher than this 7, and that means the @DJ will hold the trick.
And if the @d7 was not 4th best, then declarer has more than 1 diamond.   
So the Ace cannot run away unless declarer has the @DQ, and specifically the doubleton @SAK (or 5 clubs).
So the @DJ rates to work, and then declarer loses 2 diamonds and the @CA.

at|mitche: Bidding:  South has a fair, but not great hand. In particular, the @D suit is kind of ratty, with lots of holes.
A jump rebid in a suit should show KJ109xx or better.  Many of my partnerships insist on KQ10xxx or better. 
Anyway, 3@d would not have been my first choice of rebid.  I would bid 2@s with South hand.
What, raise with just 3??? Heresy!  Well, not really heresy, folks.  Here is why.
There is a wonderful tool (it may have a name, but I don’t know whose it is), described by Steve Robinson.
Here is how it works.  Suppose North was interested in game after a raise (and here, he might be, despite his meager 
point count) responder bids 2NT, an artificial asking bid.|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Opener is commanded to describe his hand as follows:  
- With just 3 spades and a "minimum" opener bids 3@c meaning 8 losers and 3 spades.
- With a better hand but just 3 spades, he bids 3@d, meaning 3 spade support, 7 or fewer losers.
- With 4-card support and a minimum bid 3@h, 
- and with 4 card support and a maximum, 3@s|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


at| 
Note that the 2@s raise on just 3 guarantees a ruffing value (else opener rebids some number of no trump).|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Here, N/S will either stop at 3@s or bid 4, which is going to be a very lucky make, or down 1, depending on whether East gets his @D-ruff in.
ecolodge:  Does North pass 2@S with a minimum hand?
mitche:  Yes.
So that gadget, this 4-4-3-3 bid, as we call it here, is part of Washington Standard, and it is very helpful.  
Remember it and discuss with your regular partner.

at|mitche: Play:  At 3@d, South has to hope for a couple of miracles, none of which happen... 
so he is headed for down 2, most likely.
When the @SK shows up at trick 1, however, he should probably play a club at trick 2 to set up that suit 
while he retains a spade entry to dummy, then he can ditch hearts on clubs  until someone ruffs.
Declarer should plan as follows: on a spade lead I have 2@h losers, at least 2 trump losers (maybe 3) and 1@c loser.|

at|mitche:  Therefore, I have to do something about the heart losers, and the only way I can get rid of them is on clubs. 
I must knock out the @CA before my entry to dummy disappears.
What should the defense be thinking about?|

West heard North bid spades.  So a spade lead rates to help declarer more than the defense. 
On balance, I think with this monster trump holding, I don’t want to give anything away and I make a passive lead.  
The most passive lead I have is the smallest of diamonds. |

at|mitche:  Partner won’t likely have anything good in diamonds (the jump rebid, remember, promises a GOOD suit).  
So the defense will be able to get all the tricks it's entitled to.

MM:  By clicking on the cards, you can play the hand Double Dummy,

at|mitche: Bidding:  Should East bid over 1NT? I think no.  So 1NT is destined to be the contract.

at|mitche: Play:  What should West lead?
Another tip: when the other guys bid NT and don't use Stayman or a transfer bid, the odds are that the defenders have 
more Major suit cards than declarer.  So favor a Major suit lead.|
pg| ***** 125 ***** |


at|
A spade may or may not work best on any one particular hand (West has 4 of them and an entry or 2), 
but on balance it does better than a @D.      So if you have a choice, lead from a Major.|
pg| ***** 126 ***** |


at|
A spade to the Ace, followed by a heart through declarer's hand beats 1NT (but that is not an easy defense to find)|

at|jkk9175:  Would you lead the @S4?
mitche:  Yes

Thanks to Eileen for her generous assistance and to all of you for your courteous attention and participation.
MM: You can play the hand Double Dummy if you wish
