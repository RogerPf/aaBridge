mn|Introduction|
fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back 
yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned SAYC, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.

at|mitche: Bidding: 3 spades in this auction should probably be on a better suit, but I kind of like the call anyway.
You need a bit of luck, and South's bid makes some.
4@s on North's hand looks pushy, too.  As it turns out, the best decision might be to double and defeat 4@h by a trick.

at|mitche: Play: At 4@s, West led a heart, which was clearly the right idea. When your partner preempts, she says that 
her suit is good enough for you to lead.
East then, at trick 2, led a spade and South should cover the @S8. Why?
WestElsdon:  Force the @SQ if it is in West and allow for a bad split.
mitche:  So right you are, Tom.  
If West has 3 spades to the Queen (which is really more likely than the spades dividing 2-2), when West covers 
the 9, the @SQ  is dead, and similarly, if West ducks, the 9 holds,  and then the @SA and K capture her later.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  When West won her @CA, she needs to cash the @DA before returning a heart.  
Why?|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


at|
East will not know whether to try to cash a third heart to beat the contract or to shift.  
If you give partner a chance to go wrong, even the best defender in the world will occasionally get it wrong. 
So by cashing the @DA, West assures a set (2 hearts, 2 Aces) and no way for East to go wrong.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  By the way, what was the heart that West led at trick 1?
When you have supported partner with 3 small , better to lead the top of nothing, so the honor situation in the suit is 
clarified.  Leading the 2 should suggest an honor.

at|mitche: Bidding:  Let's begin by asking what North should bid over 1@D.  With 5 hearts and 4 spades, it is correct to 
bid 1@h, not 1@s. Now North's auction shows 5 spades and 4+ hearts.  
WestElsdon: I thought I would be sending a reverse, if I bid hearts then spades.  
This was me trying to think about my second bid.
mitche:  I appreciate the consideration to a possible rebid problem.  But by distorting your distribution, you create 
problems for yourself. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  North has enough stuff to bid 2@s over a 1NT or 2@d rebid by South.  Now, what should South  rebid after 1@S.
I would not object to 2NT or 3@d.  I know, you think 2NT shows 18 points.  But look at that solid 6 bagger in diamonds.  

By bidding 2NT, the @hK is protected.  If you feel conservative, bid 3@d which shows 16-18 points.
2@d would be OK if South did not have the @HK or the @CA.  Either way, North should bid 3NT 
(with 13 points, North knows that the combined strength is not enough for slam, but more than enough for game).|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So either 1@d - 1@h / 3@d  - 3NT or 1@D - 1@h/2NT - 3NT would work for me as auctions to get to 3NT.

at|mitche:  Play:  When West leads the unbid suit (clubs, completely reasonable on the actual auction), South has 6 
diamonds, 5 heart tricks, and the @CAK.  If hearts or diamonds fail to split, declarer still has 9 tricks, 
but with both suits working, 13 tricks are available to N/S.
Here is a hint on counting - South counts 8 diamonds in the combined hands.  That leaves 5 diamonds for the defense.
If West has all 5 diamonds, there's not much she can do, but if East has them, playing low to the jack with both opponents
following, they have only 3 diamonds left.  And if West shows out, then declarer could finesse against East's @D10.|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  But when both of them follow, there remain just 3 outstanding diamonds for the defense, and the @DAKQ will  
capture all of them. So declarer knows that she has 6 diamond tricks.  
Remember always to try to count out the unseen hands.  Similarly, the @HAKQJ will work to pull all the enemy hearts, 
as long as they split no worse than 4-2.
Practice counting, folks!   That will make more of a difference than any conventions or bidding system you learn.|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  It wasn't until I practiced it for a while that I started winning.
And I PROMISE you that you will get better, but as with any skill, you gotta practice!!

well.         It is a VERY useful tool built into the latest releases.

SK||

at|mitche: Bidding: East has a nice hand over 1NT, and it's hard to see where a natural 2@C could be problematic.
Here is where....when you overcall  1NT, you need a good suit. 
@cAJ9xx is, in my opinion, not a good enough suit, especially vulnerable against not. 
Imagine that the @CQ were not in West's hand.  
Then East could be held to 6 tricks and find herself surrendering 500 points on a part-score deal.  
So the first consideration in overcalling 1NT is to have a good suit.

at|mitch: Play: When declarer "slips" and plays a spade at trick 3, East ruffed and led what?  It was the @DA. 
I think that it's safer to play @CA and a club. If North has the @CKQ, too bad, but a diamond works only if West has 
the @DK.  A club works when West has either the @CK or the @CQ  => 2 chances are better than one.  
But first cash the @hAce.    Why?
Because East will be tossed in with it and forced to make another lead.  If you are gonna be end played with the master 
trump, consider getting it off the street.|

at|mitche: Bidding:  Even in third seat, I think that East should not preempt with 3@s. Why?|
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


at|
A) The hand is worth a 3rd seat 1@S bid.. you aren't getting outbid when you own the spade suit.  AND
B) if you have 4 cards in the other Major, you risk missing a fit in it.
Why is the East hand worth 1@s?|
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


at|
It has 2 quick tricks, and with 11 cards in 2 suits, and a good 7 bagger -- the hand evaluates to something like 16 points...
If a fit is found in either suit, you're off to the races!|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  In practice, E/W can get to 3@h and make it on a cross-ruff unless the defense finds an early heart shift.
Now, let's look at the double of 3@s. I think that the double should be for takeout.  
If I had the South hand, I would probably have bid 3NT.
Butler39:  Why?  Because of the preempt?
mitche:  No, because I think I have a shot at making 3NT.  East advertised a string of spades and not much else. 
I expect 7 or maybe 8 points in dummy, and so I think I have a chance to make it... also, I bid close games at IMPs.

How can West tell East to lead a spade, other than texting "lead a spade, pard"??|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |

She should play the highest @D she can afford to play, the @D6, not the @d3.   
The @D3 says "no preference in what you lead."  Look for opportunities to use suit preference signals (SPS).

at|mitche: Bidding:  The bidding was just as it should have been thru 2@s.  
At MP's, I would expect East to balance with a double. Why?|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


at|
N/S have stopped at the 2-level, and they have a fit of sorts.  Which means E/W could also have a fit. 
At IMPs, it's riskier to come in with the East hand, and a pass is probably correct at that form of scoring.  
Anyway, the bidding was certainly reasonable.

at|mitche: Play:  Once again, a chance for a useful signal came up.  
On opening lead, West led the @DQ, and East is looking at the @DK.   
She should give the best attitude signal she could, the @D6.  
When the @D10 shows up, West knows that East must have the @DK (declarer would not duck a @D from @dAK10). 
Unless you use Upside Down count and attitude (UDCA), the 6 is the correct play at trick 1 from East.  
Declarer took an early heart hook to get to dummy and lead a spade.|

at|mitche:  When West won the @SK, she got out with a @D (right!) and then when in with the next spade, got out with a club.
I think that is mandatory, since the defense has to get clubs going before declarer discards club losers on the good 
heart suit.  
Also, declarer should, when in with a club, finish off the trump suit.  Then take her hearts. 
There is no guarantee that hearts are 3-3.

MM:  By clicking on the cards, you can play the hand Double Dummy.   To continue with the next deal click the  ^$40

at|mitche:  Bidding:   It's not that clear that West should bid 3@s to me... with 7 bad spades, 
vulnerable against not, 3@s might be a bloodbath.  Here it happens to work.  
Non-vul against vul opponents, I might have bid 4@d instead of 3. 
E/W will have a fit in one Major or the other.  And if North's 2@d is to be trusted, N/S have a 10-card fit. 
Note that 3@s can make (declarer needs to guess well to make 3@h).
If E/W do venture to the 4 level, they may find themselves going down 2 unless they do everything just right (to go down 1). 
Also, North might find a double of 4.

at|mitche: Play:  East made the unlucky lead of the @SK, and after that, declarer could not be stopped from taking 10 tricks.
azin: Could North make 5 as it went--discard a heart on third spade.
mitche:  I don't think so, as they have 2 clubs to lose and cannot avoid at least 1 heart loser.
BTW, even if East doesn't lead the @SK, since it falls doubleton, declarer will get a discard on the @SQ anyway.|

at|mitche:  To summarize what I think are the key ideas that surfaced tonight.
First:  if you want to get better at bridge, practice counting the hand - every hand, no exceptions.
Second:  we discussed counting a single suit to know if you could establish it.  
That is a good starting place for counting the entire hand.
Third:  we saw some examples of suit preference discards and returns.  
These are really useful for defenders, who need to signal to partner to help out the defense.  |
pg| ***** 128 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Sure, declarer might gather useful information from a signal -- 
but the cost of not signaling, in most cases, is to leave your partner on a guess.... 
and we saw that if you leave a losing option for partner, he will often take it. 

Thanks to Eileen for her generous assistance and to all of you for your courteous attention and questions.|
