fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back 
yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned SAYC, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.

at|mitche: Bidding: If 2@h is forcing (showing some 11+ hcp), the bidding was fine.  
North had a tough problem, whether to defend against 4@s doubled or to bid 5@h.  
When South bid hearts, North knows that her heart cards are not good for defense, so she guessed well to bid 5@h over 4@sX
West did well to bid 4@s,  you can, and you will go down 2, a fair save against 4@h.  
BUT once you push the opps to 5-level, and especially when you know their trumps are breaking badly, 
it's almost always best to let them struggle.
Now was 2@h forcing?   Not when playing negative freebids. Negative Freebids are NF|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  A Negative Freebid shows a 6+ card suit or a GOOD 5-carder with around 5-11 HCP
On this hand, if South bids 2@s, it would be forcing. 
When South then bids 3@h after the cue bid, it is game forcing.
If South cue bids 2@s and the opps come in, South would get another chance to clarify, so pass by North should show a minimum opening, with nothing else interesting to say.
If you are interested in another way to approach the topic, I invite you to google "negative free bid."

at|mitche: Play: When East won the @SA, she shifted to the @C3 at trick 2.  
With a sure trump trick, East's best chance to hoodwink declarer might be to lead a small @D.   
Declarer can make the hand without the @D finesse if trumps split decently.  
Deception is really an art, rather than a technical skill. 
Here, declarer doesn't know that she has a wicked 4-0 trump split.

Well, how strong is West hand? |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


at|
I rate it as 11 HCP + 1 for the doubleton.   And a pretty good 12 at that, with Aces and good spade support.  
The reason I ask whether you'd bid 3@S or 4 on this auction, is --
If you use sound opening bids, then I would just go to 4 directly, saying "game, not slam."  
If your opening bids are possibly light, then you may wish to invite.  
So there's no "right" answer without knowing your opening bidding style.  East will, of course, accept any invitation. |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: Now, what if we use LTC?  How many losers in East hand? |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


at|
Six of them.  And in West hand?  Eight losers.
An OPENING bid shows 7 or fewer losers.  
Responder's 8 loser hand is INVITATIONAL, so using LTC, West invites, East accepts.  
An Invitational raise is 8 losers in support of opener's Major.  Why is West an 8 loser hand? |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


at|
2 in spades, 2 in hearts, 3 in diamonds and 1 in clubs.  LTC works.. Use it!

at|mitche:  Play:  If you use "coded" opening leads,  South might try the @D9 instead of the 4th best 7. 
Either way, a @D is right.  
Declarer has to figure out what to do with 4 club losers in hand, and she correctly decided to ruff some clubs.  
When the suit turned out 3-3,  4@s is cold, unless declarer gets very sloppy. 
A note on defense:  Defense (south, mostly) can count out declarer's hand as 4 spades, 5 clubs and at least 2 diamonds, 
hence at most 2 hearts.  North did NOT discard a @D, so the inference South should make is she doesn't have one to 
discard.  But also, there's another clue, much better, to guide South to hold on to her @D. |
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  How did declarer play hearts?
calligal:  Played ace on p's jack.
mitche: Right.  If declarer has the @HQJ, she might have finessed in hearts.  
So the inference is East does not have the @HQ.  
So unless declarer is being very sneaky, dropping the @HJ from a holding of Jx... that last @D is still in her hand.
As defender, you need to ask why declarer played as she did.

at|mitche: Bidding: There are several points we need to discuss.
First: West's hand is just about strong enough for 1@D followed by a 2NT rebid (showing 18-19 HCP) if partner responds.  
BUT after the pass by responder, West should just pack it in and pass over 1NT when it comes around to her.  
East has at most a terrible 5 HCP and so E/W have at most 23 HCP -- if East has the BEST hand she could, 2NT is a stretch.

Second: South has a balancing decision.
I would reopen with double, not 1@h|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: Two reasons -
a) the hand can support either Major, and 
b) double leaves open the chance that N/S can extract a hefty penalty from 1@dX.  

So X gets North's input on what the best course of action should be where 1@h is kind of unilateral; 
and with just 4 cards in the suit, South can't be sure that hearts is their best suit.|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: Now, when 1@H comes to West, I think that 1@S is a better choice than X for 2 reasons:  
a) in standard bidding, the X here is  penalty-oriented. 
Modern bidding theory says that the X is takeout - oriented, so you need to discuss that with your regular partner.
b) Anyway, I would bid 1@S with West hand over the X.  I like my spades.  
c) And finally, East has to grapple with bidding over the X with a bust hand.  
1NT should promise a heart stopper, which East doesn't happen to have.. 
I think I would bid 1@s  and hope West doesn't go ballistic. |
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


nt|| 
at|mitche:  Someone asked if West had bid 1@S here instead of X, could it possibly show 5 spades? |
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


at|
No. If West has 5 spades, she also has 6 diamonds.  
Steve Robinson (hall of fame, world champion, author of Washington Standard) thinks that you should always open 
a 5-card Major whenever you have one.  
I am not as good as Steve, and I don't know as much as he does, so I consider his advice pretty good.  
However, if I am 5-6, I would favor opening the 6-card suit.  |
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Remember - East passed 1@d and is broke.  So I am competing with 1@S, because 
a) I am not ashamed of the suit 
b) It's the cheapest bid I can make  
c) I want pard to lead spades if she gets in and 
d) Pard can pick between one of my 2 good suits.
Again, if X is takeout, then I can get away with X and hope that East has something useful among her zero points.  
But I am willing to play in spades on my 4-3 fit at the 1-level.

at|mitche: Bidding: North has to do something over 3@C in the balancing seat.
Since West has less than an opening hand and East preempted in third seat, and North has just 7 points,  she can guess 
that South has pretty nearly an opening hand, if not more.  So I would double and see what happens.  
Also, if South has a club stack (possible on this auction, since North is void), double allows South to defend and look to get rich when that is right.
masse24: But North must act, in the auction shown.|
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: South will bid 4@h over the double and have no problems making that. In fact, N/S should make 5@h 
(diamond losers go away on spades).  
One last point on balancing:  E/W may or may not have a club fit.  
If they have a good fit, then N/S will have a good fit somewhere, and you cannot afford to let yourself get robbed of games.  
Maybe your 4@h won't work well, but you stand to gain more than you lose by balancing on these kinds of hands.
kat827: After North's X, would South bid 4@H right away, or 3@H?
mitche: 4@h.   The balancer "borrowed" 7 points from my hand for her balancing X, and I have a few more than she bid. 
South can expect 10 dummy points for the X.. so bid game.

at|mitche:  Bidding:  How would you bid the West hand after 1@S?
First off, 2@C is out ... because West has not got enough strength, even playing SAYC. 
A 2@S bid shows a 9 loser hand, and West has an 8 loser hand -- 3 in spades, 2 in each red suit, 1 in clubs. 
So 1NT followed by 3@S is about right - yeah, it's an ugly 3 card limit raise, but it's what the hand is worth.

at|mitche:  Play:  Can 4@S be defeated?
Yes, on a club ruff, declarer loses 2 diamonds and 2 trumps.  But if clubs behave, 4@S has a very decent play.
One thought.. when South had the lead in mid-hand, she exited with a trump, which pickled the @SK in North's hand. 
It's much better to get out a club (or even a @D).  Either will defeat the contract. 

MM: By clicking on the cards, you can play the hand Double Dummy.  To continue with the next deal click  ^$40

at|mitche:  Bidding:  North has an awkward hand after 2@C.  With her overall strength, she needs to do more than 2@D, 
which she could have bid with much less strength.  In competition, inverted minors are off, if you happen to play them.
So 1@D  2@C  2@D here is an underbid.  North wants to bid something like 3@C.  
3@C doesn't deny a 4 card major, and by the way, 2@h should show a better suit, so I am not keen on bidding 2@h. 
Having heard 2@d, South should be content with a 3@d bid over 2@s. 
One last point.. some play that X here (over 2@C) may promise just 1 major, not both.. 
just as long as the doubler can run if South picks the wrong one.  Just make sure to discuss.

at|mitche:  Play:  On trick 1, East played the @S7 under the Ace.  
That middle card should say, "at trick 2, shift to what you think is right, I have no preference."  
West guessed to lead a heart - the 10.
Later in play, when the @H8 fell under the Jack, I think South can place the @h9 in West's hand.  
=> can finesse in hearts for a discard of her losing club.  (West would not have led the @h10 from 1043.)  
Watch them spots!|
