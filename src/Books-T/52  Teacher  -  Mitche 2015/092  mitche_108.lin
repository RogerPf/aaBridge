fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back 
yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned SAYC, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.

pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|mitche:  Bidding:  By my calculation, you guys must have been playing with a pinochle deck!  
West's 2@s bid should be "non-forcing, constructive."  What does that mean? |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|
It shows club tolerance (which she has), and a good spade suit, which she sort-of has.  I would say that your spades 
are adequate.  The 2@S bid shows about 10 points, a doubleton club (so partner won't get hurt if he has to return to clubs).
So 2@s is, as suggested, OK.  North's 3@D bid is in keeping with Bergen's "5-5 come alive" philosophy.  North has 2 
reasonably good suits, so if a fit is found, the hand will play well.  Over 3@d, East's 4@C call strikes me as an overbid.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  7222 shape is the worst possible for a hand with a 7 card suit, and the club suit is nothing to write home about.
As for South, Tom's 4@d call is justified, given the bidding.  North promised either extra strength or an unbalanced 
hand, so the fit (and an outside A) justify the raise to 4@D.  I don't know if I would raise to 5@C with West hand ...  
Here's why I would: a singleton and the very strong doubleton look like offense, not defense.
Here is why I would not: I have length in opener's suit and I expect partner to have some defensive values (with just clubs,
she might have preempted) and it's easier to take 4 tricks than 11.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So West has a hard decision.  I do not like to be pushed to the 5 level (old saying, "the 5 level belongs to 
the opponents").  So I might take my chances on defense.
As it happens, 4@D fails on best defense, losing a spade, club, diamond, and declarer cannot avoid loss of heart, 
I think.

at|mitche: Play: South led the @H5 and declarer dropped the @HQ under the Ace.  North should ask, where is the @HK? 
It must be with declarer.  Why?  If South began with @HK5, he would have led the @hK, not the 5.
So North can return the @H2 at trick 2. South will ruff.  Back comes a diamond, and a third heart forces declarer 
to ruff high, else South over ruffs with the @CQ.  And now declarer has to guess to finesse in order to hold herself 
to down 2.  (Defense should cash the @SA before trying for a second heart ruff, by the way.)  The key point here is
to get in the habit of using the information from the play of the cards. |

at|mitche: Bidding: West's first call was to pass. What do you all think of that?  And if you think West should have done
something different, what would you suggest West might have bid? 1NT? |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


at| 
I think West has a textbook negative double here.  
1NT shows a ^*uspade stopper^*n and is not forcing.  The only time 1NT is forcing is when -
a) responder is unpassed hand (here that is true) and 
b) opener begins with 1@h or 1@S (also true here) and 
c) second hand passes (not true here).|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So the neg X says "support for the minors" and since West's double is forcing East to bid at the 2-level,
the negative X here shows 8+  
If East is forced to rebid 2@h, West's Qx will not be disappointing, so the negative X is a standout choice.
OK, now on to east's second bid.  She bid 3@D, for which she certainly is strong enough.  
There is a better bid, and that is 2@S.  
That asks West to "do something smart", with first preference being to look at her spades, and if she finds a full stopper,
to bid some number of NT.|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt||  
at|mitche: Since East is forcing a passing partner to bid at the 3-level, that 2@S cue-bid promises at least 16-17 HCP.
If responder does not happen to have a spade stop, she bids a suit or just returns to hearts with any 3 of them or with 
2 to an honor.  So West will bid 3@D and East should raise to 4 
(remember, 3@d by West in this situation doesn't promise a good hand -- the bid was forced).  
West will now happily raise to 5 - East has to have MORE than that 16 point minimum to raise to 4.
Then, the auction would look like this:    1@h - (1@s) - p - p - / 2@s - p - 3@d - p - / 4@d - p - 5@d
 |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: Here's the idea:  East can stand to play in pretty much any strain, and 2@S gives West a chance to participate in the decision. 
CarlieG:  Does the 2@S cuebid show stoppers in the unbid suits or is it just asking about a spade stopper, possibly 
for other reason?
mitche:  The 2@S bid asks for spade stopper.   If West finds one, 3NT might be the best place to play.  
I kind of like this rather than 3@D, since responder might have a 5 card minor.  
I would also consider a reopening X instead of 2@s (except, I do not want pard to convert it to penalties).|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt||  
at|CarlieG:  Is East strong enough for 2@C opening bid?
mitche: The knock on 2@C is that it becomes harder to get the nature of the hand over to partner, especially if South bids 2@S.  
Should E/W arrive at 6@D?  I think that it's hard to get there after the initial pass.  
What happens if West negatively doubles?  
East will then bid 3@d (or maybe 3@S, now asking for spade stop) and  West will appreciate that all her cards are working.
If East bids 3@D, West should bid 5. Then East might try 6@D.
WestElsdon:  Would you have bid 2@S over an opening 2@C bid?|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt||  
at|mitche: I might have bid 2@S over 1@h with your hand as you have no defense outside of spades, so 2@s gets your hand off 
your chest with 1 bid.   The auction won't die there.  
And, yes, I would bid 2@s over 2@C.  When the bridge gods give you AKQxxx in spades, they mean for you to bid them!

at|mitche:  Play:  Declarer made 12 tricks by finding clubs to be 3-3, but she has a better line of play. 
She can pull trumps in 3 rounds and then cash 3 hearts.  When the suit splits 4-2, one ruff will set up her 5th heart.  
Then she wins 4 heart tricks, 4 diamond tricks, a spade ruff, and 3 clubs without need for any good luck in clubs..

at|mitche: Bidding: I do not agree with North's double for 2 reasons:  
First, her shape is abysmally flat – you need shortness in spades to double here.  Even a doubleton spade is too many.
Second: where are the points?  North has 14, West 15, leaving 11 for the South and East hands.
Partner rates to have 5 or 6, so the points are pretty evenly divided... and with no strong distribution, 
you will be lucky to make 9 tricks with half the deck.  I would not risk 500 on a part score hand at IMPS.
At matchpoints, 2@S rates to be an average, and I won't risk a half-board unless I have a reasonable expectation of 
taking 8 tricks, which I don't have on this hand.|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt||  
at|mitche:   So I pass at any form of scoring.  As it happens, 2@S is going to go down 1 or 2 
(2 spades, 2 hearts, 2 diamonds, 1 club = down 2; but a club from North allows declarer to get off for down 1)

at|mitche:  Play:  at 3@C.  It turns out that a spade lead costs the defense a trick (declarer scores his spade J ), 
but West was correct to lead the @SQ.  Best defense is to shift to @DA and a diamond, but that is impossible to find.
West made a nice defensive play by forcing dummy to win a trump and lead away from the @HAQ.

at|mitche:  Bidding:  Frank Stewart (the guy who writes the daily bridge column) is a dinosaur - but he makes the
point that if you make an unusual 2NT call, you should make sure your side has a chance to win the contract and take a
profitable save.  
West has almost a full opener, without which 4@C would have been a wipeout.  Modern style is to be more active on defense, 
but Stewart's point is very well taken, especially when you are vul.  You don't need a lot of points, but you do need good 
suits.  I suggest K109xx is about the minimum for both suits when not vul.. Add at least one queen when you are vul. |
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


nt||   
at|WestElsdon: OK, I got carried away and was less than fully knowledgeable about how to bid U2NT, but this is how I learn.
mitche: YEP!
South is under the gun with a pretty good hand.  And 3@H sounds very much like "just competing."
I guess  North thought South had more values than 3@h promised for her 4@h bid.  
Note that the problem N/S have is to tell the difference between a good 3@h bid and "just competing."
There is a convention, called "unusual over unusual".  
If you have an established partnership, you may want to read up on it. |
pg| ***** 66 ***** |

at|mitche: Play: As declarer, I would hope for 2 dummy entries to finesse twice in trumps.   
But as the cards sit, playing the @HA also works to hold heart losers to one.  Why do I want to finesse twice in trumps?
After the unusual NT, I am concerned that West has @hKQx   
So leading toward the @DK and then finessing in spades was the correct line - as long as East has 2 spades..

at|mitche:  Play:  Leading from West hand is pretty hard.  I hate to lead from the club king or either red suit. 
Leading the @DA is lucky, but when leading any side suit risks blowing a trick, it is time to think about a trump. 
On this hand, the @S7 is the "book" lead - and as long as the defense lays off the diamond suit, declarer will go 
down at least 1 trick.

MM: By clicking on the cards, you can play the hand Double Dummy.  To continue with the next deal click  ^$40

at|mitche: Bidding: I think this was about the right auction all round.  Good job on the bidding, folks.
South was thinking about doing something over 2 diamonds, I guess... 
and here is some guidance on whether to bid or pass.
When you bid, you have something new to tell partner, some extras that your previous bidding did not disclose.  
For example, extra strength or some good distribution.  
Here, South has not got any extra strength, so there is no news for pard in that department.|

at|mitche: And 5422 is reasonably close to balanced, so there's no news there, either. 
Since pard did not bid 1@h, there is no value in bidding hearts, so pass.  
My friend, the late MaryAnn Dufresne, used to teach her students, "don't tell the same story twice" in the bidding.

at|mitche: Play: The takeout X suggests that EAST is more likely to have club cards than West, right?
OK, so that means that declarer would like to make the first club lead from dummy.
How? 
Well, the easiest way is just to win the first diamond with the @dK and lead a club toward the @cK at trick 2. 
When the Queen pops up, declarer has no more problems.|
