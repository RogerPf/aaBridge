fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
First, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."
Mitch Edelman aka "mitche"


MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.
Thank you Eileen (wyoming33) for sending the hands and editing the chatlog! @h

at|mitche: Bidding: After the 1@S overcall, South has a hand that would like to bid, but probably should not.  
A "free bid" should show a somewhat better hand, in Standard bidding - about 9-10 points. 
South is close, but as they say, "no cupie doll".|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|
The deciding factor for me is the poor quality diamond suit.  
Change the hand to something like    x, Kxx, QJ10xx,K10xx    and I would have no qualms about 2@d, 
even though hand 2 has a weaker heart suit.
Should North raise to 3@d?|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  I am tempted to bid 2NT with the North hand.  In standard bidding, North can't pass 2@d.
The problem with 2NT is having 2 suits wide open. 
On the other hand, the 8-trick level is a better bet than a 9-trick contract.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|
gehrhorn:  Is there any bid after 2@d where North can ask / show stoppers?
mitche:  Playing standard techniques, North is stuck. 
Remember that in standard bidding, a free bid at the 2 level shows 10 points.

at|mitche: Play: South has 7 losers and the spade suit will cover 3 of them, as long as no ruffs happen. 
But East must have great length in spades to bid them, missing the tops, 
=> South knows that he can't cash 3 of them.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


at|
I think it might be better to play a club from dummy at trick 2 and if it wins, finesse in diamonds.
Notice that the @dK98 is guaranteed to produce an entry, so South doesn’t have to worry that he will strand the spade tricks.
|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt||at|gehrhorn: At trick one, when my partner leads a spade and dummy has AKQx, I can't possibly want spades continued.
So what is my card signaling?  Suit preference?
mitche:  What do you want led?
gehrhorn:  I don't think I cared that much.
mitche:  If East played the @SJ under the Ace at trick 1, then it would be a very strong preference for hearts.|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


at|
A low spade means "find a smart shift, pard".. The best shift for West would not be obvious.
A club is safest.|

sk||
at|mitche: Bidding:  When you’re in third/fourth seat (responder), and your RHO (overcaller) overcalls, 
let's look at what your various actions mean:|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt||
at|a) 2@s: minimum support of your partner's suit is 3-card support and may be weak.
b) a jump raise (3@s, here) is preemptive, showing 4 card support.
c) a new suit is a "free bid", which we just got through discussing, and it is forcing.
d) a cue bid (here 3@D) shows a limit raise or better, or very strong hand.
e) and a notrump bid is natural, non-forcing, and shows a stopper with points sufficient to bid at the level you're bidding at|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: A 2NT bid would be about 9-11 points, balanced hand, and 1 1/2 stoppers in the overcalled suit.
Here, North can bid 2@h to show values or 3@d if she thinks the hand belongs in spades.
I prefer 2@h, since South could have 4 of them.
South will raise to 3@h (or should), and North will now bid 3@s (showing a 3-card support), I think.
Someone asked if South should open.|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Well, let's see, he has 2 1/2 quick tricks, 11 HCP, and 8 cards in his 2 longest suits. 
So it's not a Bergen 20 or a Mitch 22 opener.
In second seat, vul, I think it better to pass. Also, the lack of texture (10's and 9's) makes the hand less attractive.  
So I pass, I think.
gehrhorn:  Does 3@d guarantee (98%ish) 4+ trumps or can you bid it with 3 after 2@d overcall?|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Good question. 
To force to the 3-level, you should have 4-card support or a pretty good hand.  
Reason - Law of total tricks.|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


at| 
N/S are a bit unlucky in that neither hand has a ruffing value for the other. 
As you have probably figured out, I kind of like sound opening bids in first and especially in second seat.  
The last 2 hands showed you why.
Both North and South had 8 losers, and their hands produce exactly 8 tricks.. no surprise.

at|mitche: Play:  Declarer has 5 losers and not much hope to avoid any of them.
Playing off the @SAK leaves one trump out, and it's a winner. So South should probably not waste time and 2 trumps 
to force out the @SQ. 
Better is to stop playing trumps and go to work on hearts and get out for down 1.|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |

The key here is for South to preserve his trumps to protect himself from being run out of them and losing an extra

at|mitche: Bidding:  1@h, 1@s, pass are all book bids.
For those who play Michaels cue bids, I recommend you use good-bad Michaels, 
where a 2@h cue-bid here shows either less than 12 HCP or more than 15, 
and with the 12-15 point hand, you bid your two suits.|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


at|  
The reason for that treatment is you will know whether to get to game when it's right.|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


nt||at|
East, with no great strength or fit for hearts, does best to pass 1@s.
What should South do over 1@S?  He has 7 losers, and that makes the hand invitational in strength. 
So how can South show a game-invitational hand?|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


nt||

at|mitche: 3@s is preemptive (see hand 2).     2@h is fine, I think.
The problem with 2@h, however, is that 3 small in opener's bid suit is known (for very good reasons) as the 
"death holding"       and this hand shows you why.  

So I would bid 3@h -- a "mixed raise," if you happen to have that bid in your toolkit.
North, who also has the death holding, would know that South has 8-10 HCP, with a 3-card support.|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  I am saying that 1@h (1@s) pass (3@h) is the "mixed raise"... but not everyone plays them. 
The South hand is actually stronger than that but I adjust down because of the "death holding". 
WestElsdon: What do you evaluate it's strength as?|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


at|
mitche: South has 8 HCP, an extra point for the @D singleton and another extra point for the quality club suit.
I would also add a point for the long club.  So what's that, 11 or so?
So 2@h would be fine (which is where we started).|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  If I were very conservative, I use the mixed raise.
WestElsdon:  So a cue-bid with 3 trump is ok?
mitche:  Yes, here with 3 good trumps and a ruffing value, I think so.

By now you can see where the fun in bidding is... if you are an optimist, you bid 2@h with South hand. 
If you are a pessimist, you bid 3@h. 
How much fun is that!!! |
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  All right - if South bids 2@h, West bids 3@h    and North might bid 4@s 
... hoping that it's her partner with heart shortness, and 4@s fails by 1 trick. 

Mixed raise: Advancer makes a jump cue-bid at the 3-level to show 3-card support for partner's overcall and 
about 8 to bad 11 support points.|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


nt||
cp|4|at|Eileen: I have googled “mixed raise” and every site says a mixed raise needs 4-card support, 
which only makes sense cause you are forcing to the 3-level (LOTT).  
“Jump Cue Bid Mixed Raise":  This is a method of responding to partner’s overcall that utilizes a jump cue bid in the 
enemy suit to show a Mixed Raise of partner’s suit.  
A mixed raise shows around 7-9 support points along with four-card support and contains both constructive and pre-emptive values.  
The fourth card in the trump suit is what makes this different from the simple raise.”

sk||

at|mitche: Bidding:  Playing standard or 2 over 1, this is a tough slam to reach.
South's 1NT is correct, .. a balanced 12, planning to jump raise hearts, I guess.
North's 4@h shows about 20 points, and her hand is just about worth that bid.. she has a 4 loser hand, so why not?|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


at|
Well, I'll tell you why not. The hand has tremendous slam potential, and there are better ways to show that.
I would consider either 3@d (jump-shift) to allow South to show her hand or 4@c, a splinter bid, 
showing tremendous strength and club shortness.|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  If North had bid 3@d, South would bid 3@s, and North can cue bid 4@c. 
Why 3@s?
3@S by South, by the way, confirms hearts as trumps - and shows a spade control, either the A or K.
Now the slam becomes easier to bid -- easier, but still not easy.
Note that 3@s is an "impossible" suit. If South had a genuine spade suit, she would have bid 1@s over 1@h, not 1NT.  
So if South bid 4@h, after a 3@s bid, North can bid 5@h, asking if South has good trump support. |

at|mitche: Bidding:  Let's begin with one of the more useful tools in the 2 over 1 toolbox, the Drury convention.
East passed in second seat and discovered that her hand is pretty good opposite the 1@s bid.
But West (fourth seat) could bid 1@s on a pretty minimum hand (rule of 15 opener maybe).
Wouldn’t it be a shame if E/W bid to 3@S when they could take only 8 tricks?
So Drury is designed to solve that problem.|
pg| ***** 102 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: With a limit raise and 3-card support, East would bid 2@c 
and with 4-card support, 2@d.  (2-way Drury)
West, who opened, would then bid 2@S to say "subminimum opening bid." 
Any other bid is forcing to the 3-level.
If West has a sound opener, she just bids 4@s.
Because East passed, West knows whether there is slam potential, and 4@s says "game, not slam."
And here, that is just what West would bid: 4@s|
pg| ***** 103 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  East might have the magic hand, Axxx, AKx,xxxx, xx  and we will show how West can find out. 
I treat a new suit by opener as a decent side suit.
So over 2@d, West bids 3@c.  Saying "please bid a control with a maximum for your Drury bid."
And if East has an ace or king to show, she would do so.|
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


at| 
3@d would be a turn off for West, but 3@h would be an encouraging call for a slam try.
But West should probably just be happy to bid 4@s over the Drury 2@D.|
pg| ***** 105 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  A hand where West might bid 3@c would be something like KQ10xx, Axx, x, AQJx
Some people play Bergen by passed hands, but I think that you are better off to use Drury. 
kat827:  What are the bids for reverse Drury?|
pg| ***** 106 ***** |


at|
mitche:  Responder bids 2@d with 4-card support for opener's major and limit raise strength, 2@c with 3-card support.
With "reversed" 2-way Drury the meaning of the 2@c and 2@d bids are reversed, 2@d being the 3-card support now.
Problem with Bergen is that you are 1 level higher.. Drury keeps you at 2-level on minimum hands.|
pg| ***** 107 ***** |


nt||at|WestElsdon: Use Drury only when a passed hand?
mitche:  Exactly right, Tom.
BILAsst10: East has 13 Bergen points - can open?

mitche:  East has a Bergen 20 or Mitch 22.  So yes, could open 1@d.  
Then the bidding would be    1@d - 1@S - 2@s - 4@s

sk||
at|mitche: Bidding: West's negative X is light.  Some people would bid that way without a second thought,
but I suggest you should have at least 1 defensive trick for bidding.
Yes, 5-5 come alive, and as with all aphorisms, there are times to ignore it, 
and I think 5 HCP without an ace might be one of them .. we can always balance.|
pg| ***** 122 ***** |


at|
BayouBelle: What about North’s response?
mitche:  Now, what about 3@d?|
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  North has 4333 shape and 8 HCP.
So with flat hand, it is a bad idea to blast to the 3-level (remembering death holding discussion from earlier).
I sympathize with the idea of 3@d, but  North also has 9 losers, so I would bid 2@d -- 
the North hand will be a disappointment to South more often than a joy.|
pg| ***** 124 ***** |

The jump raise here is based on 4+ card support, but also you should have some positive distribution.
East correctly bids 3@h over the neg X, and when the bidding comes around to her again, she bid 4@h|
pg| ***** 125 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  The 4@h bid is optimistic, but also correct -- West should have some better values. 
Sometimes you will get to game off all 4 aces.  But then you should have defense.
Should East double 4@d? |
pg| ***** 126 ***** |


at|
East has a heart fit, so he can't expect many tricks in hearts. 
The @DK is doubtful;  South bid to the 4 level opposite a weak response.
Where are East's tricks coming from?|
pg| ***** 127 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  E/W have agreed on @h.... West promised some tolerance for hearts with the X.
When you think about doubling opponents, please use ^*bthe rule of 10 and 12^*n. 
It's one of Ron Klinger's many good ideas for competitive bidding.

And remember, when you have a fit, your values in that suit are not going to win as many tricks on defense as 
you think they will.|
pg| ***** 128 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Here is the rule, from Klinger’s book of bridge tips.  Deciding whether to convert takeout X to penalty:
a) subtract the "number of trumps you hold" from 12, 
and if the number is at least as large as the level, you meet the rule of 12;  
b) subtract the "number of trump winners" from 10, 
and if that number is at least as large as the level, you meet the rule of 10.|
pg| ***** 129 ***** |


at|  
If you pass both tests, you have enough trump strength to convert a takeout X to penalties. 
Also, you should not have an 8-card  fit with partner’s Major.|
pg| ***** 130 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  

Example 1:  xx, QJxxx, xx, Kx  your LHO opens 1@h and partner doubles — you meet the rule of 12, but 
not the rule of 10.  Should not pass out the double.

Example 2: xx, KJ10x, xxx, Kxxx - RHO opens 1@H, LHO raises to 2, and partner doubles.   You can pass (= convert)
(12 - 4 = 8, level of contract), and KJ10x should produce 2 trump tricks (10 - 2 = 8, level of contract).

at|mitche: Play: At 4@H, South should probably start with the @CJ rather than lead an ace.

West promised spade length (if not strength), 
so the @SA gives away both a tempo and control of a suit the declarer is known to hold. |
