fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back 
yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned SAYC, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Completing Your Convention Card  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|^b@2mitche:    ^*BPart 1:  NT Bidding and Responses^*N

The first part of today's session is to go over "filling out the convention card"  for our sessions. 
This is part 1 of what will be an extended set of lectures.   
It  deals with what I think is a reasonable way to treat opening 1NT bids and responses.
The NOTRUMP structure:     ^*b1NT^*n
Open 1NT with 15-17 HCP, or 14 points with a good (QJ10xx or better) 5-card suit.  
We open 1NT on all balanced hands in this point range, including those with 5-card Majors 
(but note, we will downgrade quack-heavy 15 point hands and upgrade hands with Aces,  Kings, and 10's).
So for example    @sQxx  @hKQx  @dJx  @cAQ10xx       looks like 1NT to me, with 14 HCP and a good 5 card club suit.
I would not object to 1@C, but you will get to more making games opening this 1NT than you will go down in bad 3NT 
contracts.

After opener begins with 1NT, recommended 2 level bids by responder:
- Stayman: non-forcing 2@C (that is, you do not need to reach game after 1NT - P - 2@c)
- Transfer Bids: Use 2-way Jacoby transfers (i.e. 2@D transfers to 2@h, and 2@h transfers to 2@S)
- 2@s = minor suit Stayman.
- 2NT invites game and shows a good 8 or 9 points. Opener accepts on 16 or more points. 

Additionally, ^*b3-level bids^*n by responder:     (All 3-level bids are alertable, not announced)
- 3@C = Puppet Stayman; 
- 3@D = 5-5 GF in minors; 
- 3@H = 5-5 invitational (8-9 points) in the Majors; 
- 3@S = 5-5 GF in Majors;       - 3NT = to play.
Note that since we are happy to open 1NT with a hand like AKxxx, Kxx, Ax Q10x, we need to be able to locate a spade 
fit when responder has something like @sQxx, @hJx, @dAxxx, @cKxxx; so puppet gets us to the 4@S spot.
|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||cp|2|ht|b|at|^b@2
Finally:    ^*b4-level bids^*n by responder:

4@C = ^*bGerber^*n – Aces only (no key-card Gerber here);     4@D   and 4@h are Texas transfers; 
4@s is not used (there are some conventional treatments, but I suggest avoiding them for the moment); 
4NT = slam ^*uinvitational^*n (^*bquantitative^*n)         Opener accepts on 16+    (responder has 16-18 points) 
5NT = slam ^*uforcing^*n    (^*bquantitative^*n)           Opener bids small slam on 14-16,    grand slam on max);     
6NT  and 7NT are to play.  ( though on occasion you might want to raise 7NT to 8 )

veeree:  How many points for 5NT?
mitche:  5NT forces 6 and invites 7 on a maximum, so it shows about 20 points. 
My recommendation is to check for Aces first and guess to bid 7 with 35 HCP and all 4 Aces. 
If you have a running 6-card suit and a couple of outside Aces, you may use Gerber.  
Example:    @sx   @hAx   @dKQx   @cAKQJ10xx    - if pard has 2 Aces, you want to be in 7NT.

WestElsdon:  Is puppet stayman alertable?  
mitche:  Yes, puppet stayman (3@C) is alertable, and so are the responses to it.
What you want to remember is that playing this card, any 3-level bid by responder is alertable.

Understandings:

1NT -- 2@D / 2@h -- 4@H (or 1NT -- 2@h / 2@s -- 4@s) are mild slam tries, showing 6 card suit (or excellent 5 card suit) 
and around 15 HCP. Opener may pass or try for slam with maximum  and 3 card fit.
(mild slam tries, as we have the    "Texas transfers followed by pass"     for NO slam interest)

1NT -- 4@d / 4@h -- 4NT is RKCB   ( = Texas transfer with clear slam interest) 

We use Garbage Stayman.  
We use super acceptance of transfer bids to show 4 cards in the transfer suit.
|cp|4|at|(more on super accepting in the future)|cp|2|at|

 |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||cp|2|ht|b|at|^b@2
Over Interference: 

- Over a double or 2@C overcall, systems are "on"
- We use ^*bLebensohl^*n over any other overcall.  (Lebensohl is a lesson in itself, maybe 2 lessons!)
Probably the most important component of Lebensohl is the ^*u2NT - 3@c relay^*n.  
If responder bids 2NT after 1NT is overcalled, opener is required to bid 3@C
   
Responder then may:   
 
A) pass to play in clubs;  
B) bid 3@D to play there;  
C) cue bid to show a stopper in overcaller’s known suit and ask for opener to bid a Major (cue-bid Stayman with stopper);
|cp|4|at|NOTE: if responder makes an immediate cue bid, e.g. 1NT (2@h) 3@h, this is cue bid Stayman without a stopper.|cp|2|at| 
D) bid 3NT after 3@c relay to show values for 3NT plus a stopper in overcaller’s suit.
|cp|4|at|NOTE if responder bids 3NT directly over an overcall, e.g. 1NT (2@h) 3NT 
responder guarantees the strength to play 3NT BUT DENIES a stopper in hearts, the overcalled suit. 
OPENER MUST  HAVE STOPPER to pass and play 3NT. |cp|2|at|

That is the more or less complete set of agreements we like to use for 1NT openers and responses

I will now add a very popular alternative treatment:  ^*b4-way JTB^*n (Jacoby transfer bids)

If you use 4-way JTBs then the 2NT response is not available for an invitational NT raise.
You get around this by allowing responder to bid 2@C ^*uwithout^*n a 4-card Major. 
Then, (if you have no Major), you invite by rebidding 2NT over any response to your Stayman-bid.
If you bid 2@C and you DO have a 4-card Major, you raise hearts or spades as appropriate. 
If you have 4 spades, you will bid 2@S over 2@h. 
In the auction 1NT -- 2@C – 2 any -- 3NT  responder will, of course, have a 4-card Major, or else he would have just bid 
3NT directly. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||cp|2|ht|b|at|^b@2
jonnyquest: The auction 1NT - 2@C - 2@H - 2@S would be less than Game Force values correct?
mitche:  The auction 1NT – 2@C/ 2@H - 2@S is invitational with 4 spades, not 4 hearts by responder.

1NT - 2@C 
2@d - 3@s       shows 4@S and 5@h (Smolen), which I did not discuss here (it's in my advanced lesson notes).

Here's a quick overview of ^*bSmolen^*n:

When responder has 4 of one Major and 5 of the other, with game forcing strength, start with Stayman.  
If opener hits one of your majors, just bid game. 
But if opener says 2@D, you jump-bid to 3 of your ^*ushorter^*n (the 4-card) Major.
Opener may then bid 4 of the other Major (the one in which you implied a 5-card) with a 3-card support.
 
Example : Opener has @sQx   @hJxx   @dAKxx   @cKQJx
If the auction goes  1NT – 2@C/ 2@d – 3@S, opener can bid 4@h, which probably does OK.
At matchpoints, it's less clear whether to bid 3NT or 4@H but at IMPS, 4@h is a safer contract.

The other half of Smolen: with an INVITATIONAL 5-4, start with Stayman, and if opener bids 2@D, you bid your 5-card Major
at the 2-level:      1NT - 2@c / 2@d - 2@s   = Invitational hand with 5 spades and 4 hearts.  
Again, opener will know where to place the contract almost all the time.

That is the short version of the Smolen convention.

BILAsst10: You need to agree to play Smolen and Puppet Stayman so best in regular partnerships or with very advanced 
players - and remember that these bids are alertable.
mitche:  Adding a point:  Any agreement, even a poor one, is better than no agreement.
OK, let's play some bridge!

|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|mitche:  Bidding:   The rebid of 2@S after a forcing 1NT promises a 6-card suit.  So East's rebid over 1NT is 2@D.  
Yes, it's a 3-card suit, but you have to do it.  
After 2@D, West will correct to 2@S, anyway, but you should know the standard treatments for rebids after forcing 1NT.  
That is next week's lesson, I think -- rebids after forcing 1NT.  
However, if you open 1NT on all hands that look like 1NT hands, you avoid that rebid problem.
The hard hand is 4@S, 5@H and 2-2 in the minors, where you'll need to rebid 2@c with a 2-card suit after 1NT forcing. 
Some people play Flannery to handle that problem, but unless a student is paying me, I will not use that convention.

at|mitche: Play: South led the @H9, covered by @hJ and won by @HQ at trick 1, and the @c6 was led at trick 2.  
Defense then takes 1 club and continues hearts, won by @hA.  Declarer should now give up a diamond before playing even 1 round
of trump. He needs to find a parking place for his third diamond.
The defense was friendly; when South was in with his club, he should get out with a trump to kill the @D ruff.  
Best play by declarer and defense should result in down 1, by the way.|

pg| ***** 33 ***** |


at|mitche: Bidding: First, I think that North, despite his perfect shape for a takeout X, should just pass.  
At unfavorable vulnerability, it doesn't pay to get too frisky.  Since partner passed, a double runs the risk of getting too
high and going for a large number. South won't believe that North lacks a full opener.  

At other vulnerabilities, especially when the opps are vul and you aren’t, then you can shade the high card point 
requirements for a takeout double a bit.  I use 10 points as the minimum for TO double.  So North was very aggressive here.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  The XX by East promises a maximum for the pass, and East, with a good 10 points, a good suit, and decent 
support certainly has that.  
jonnyquest:  Would you consider 3@H by Bob as a possible response?  1NT - X - (XX) - 3@H? 
mitche:  Haven't got there yet, - but may as well get there now: I would bid at least 3@h or more likely 4@H.  
If partner has a full opener, I expect to lose 3 tricks. 
veeree:  I wanted to bid 2 clubs.
mitche:  Bidding 2@C over the X is a weak, lead-directional bid.  3@C is preemptive.|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Basically, almost all strong sequences over X begin with XX.  So XX sends the message:  good hand.  
After 2@h, 3@D was great idea.  Pard is a very good bet to have 4 or more @D on this auction, and you would love to take
ruffs in hearts.  In clubs, you take heart ruffs with the long trump suit.  

East's question is a very good one: If you play in @D (as East-West), the club suit generates 2 discards from declarer's hand.
If you play in @C, the @D suitgenerates NO discards.  So you want to be in the 4-4 fit.  Also, in a @D contract, East 
takes the heart ruff without E/W losing control of the trump suit.|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Hopefully that clarifies the ideas for bidding 3@D instead of 3@C
One last bidding point: After North pulls the double of 3@d, South should probably bid 4@h.
Reason: North MUST have good hearts and extreme @D shortness, so South's singleton club and spade honor suggest the 
hand would do well on a crossruff.
veeree:  If north passes first round ,    1@d - (pass) - ??   What shall I bid?
mitche:  If North passes 1@D, East should then bid 2@C.  As a passed hand, you cannot be forcing to game, so you show 
10-12 dummy points and a good suit.

at|mitche:  Bidding:  One of my mentors told me, "Mitch if you want to steal, do it before the other side knows it."
So if South wants to double, he should do it over 1@D, not 2@D.  
Doubling 2@D should be very much penalty-oriented.  Why??  
Precisely because South did not double 1@D for takeout.
2@d is probably making, so North guessed well to remove it to 2@S.

at|mitche:  Play:  I think West needs to cash the @DA before giving East a ruff.  Reason: East is unlikely to be able to 
over ruff TWO rounds of clubs, and unblocking the @DA will allow the defense to win all its tricks.
Also, when East doesn’t have the @DK, West will get a ruff in.

at|mitche: Bidding: Playing 2 over 1, would you bid 2@h over 1@S?
BridgeSus1:Sure
WestElsdon: Looks ok to me.
CarlieG: Maybe marginal but I knew we would end in spades and saw enough for game.
mitche: OK, that's fair.  When I ask the question, I want you to think and check your rationale.  I would bid 2@h.  
Also, the 1@S bid was not my first choice for the North hand.  I would bid 2@s.  Here is why:  
a) North does not have 2 quick tricks, and b) the hand is very offense-oriented.|
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: If you use disciplined weak 2's in first/second seat, this bid is probably the best one you can make.
Now, what should South do over a 2@S bid?     3@S is a preemptive raise...
If I am trying to get to game, I would bid 2NT.  
If you use SOUND PREEMPTS in first/second seat, so that 2@s shows a decent suit, then you may as well use Feature-Asking 2NT.       And North, with no outside feature, just bids 3@S and that is that.
BridgeSus1:  I don't think that South should bid 2NT.
mitche: Well, if playing disciplined weak 2's, he may risk 4@s if North shows a heart feature, which can only be the @hK.

at|mitche: Play: At 4@S, declarer needs his full quota of good luck.  He has 3 losers in the minors so he has to figure 
out what to do with the losing diamonds.  My idea is that he should try to ruff them all.

Alternatively, declarer can try to set up hearts, which required 3-3 hearts, but that also requires 3 entries to dummy...
2 to ruff hearts and a third one to get back and cash them.  Better to play on crossruff lines.  Oh, let me clarify my 
thinking on the line declarer should take. |
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:   Whether he tries to crossruff the hand or ruff out diamonds, the one thing he must not do is pull trumps 
too soon.

at|mitche:  Bidding:   What should East do after a 1NT opener?|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


at|     It depends.
If you don’t know what your agreements are, you don’t know what to do. 
Remember "any agreement is better than no agreement."
johnny cra:  Should I open 1NT?
mitche:  Yes, 1NT is the right opening bid in Standard bidding, where the bid shows 15-17 (or 14+ -> 17).  
If playing DONT, East is not quite strong enough for double, followed by 2@s.  So East needs to decide whether to treat this 
as a 1-suiter with spades or a 2-suiter with @S and @D.  And it's a guess.|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  However, when I have to make a guess, I opt for the one with the best payoff if I guess right.  
And here, 2@S rates to be the best choice more often than 2@d will.
Reasons:  First, the spade suit is much better, 
Second, with 5-4, you do not want to be in a 4-3 @D fit when a 5-2 or 5-3 spade fit is there, 
And third, 2@D allows South to show hearts cheaply. 2@S takes away the 2 level from South.

at|mitche:  Play:  Check with your partner whether the opening lead of an Ace against NT asks for third hand to unblock an 
honor. (Read Kantar's books on defense, please!!)
Assuming that E/W were not playing that, the Ace should ask for attitude.  And West is not enamored of spades, so she plays 
the 3 (correctly).  At trick 2, since the Ace promised the King, the correct card is the @SQ.  When you make a lead of the 
top of a sequence, the next lead in that suit should be the LOWEST CARD IN THE SEQUENCE.  Sure it helps declarer place 
the spade honors, but it also helps partner get the picture.|
pg| ***** 100 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  On defense, we believe that partner will be able to use the information more than declarer will.
So East plays the @SQ, gets a second count card, and runs the spades.  What should declarer's discards be?|
pg| ***** 101 ***** |


at|
The 3 discards should be the 2 small diamonds and then a HEART.  Declarer can't afford to ditch a small club. 
If East has 3 of them, the defense will then score another trick. 
Let me thank Eileen for her generous assistance and all of you for your courteous attention and thoughtful questions.
