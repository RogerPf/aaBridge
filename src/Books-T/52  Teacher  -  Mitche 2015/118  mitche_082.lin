fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back yard),
3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned SAYC, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|mitche:  Bidding:  I think that South has a 3@d bid over 2@d for several reasons:
First, at IMPS, +110 and +120 are the same score, and
Second, a @D contract is safer.
Here, 3@d is losing 2 hearts, a spade, and a club, and is likely to make whenever @D split 3-2.
A raise of opener's second suit in standard bidding shows 4-card support and 11-12 dummy points.
btour:  Forcing NT could be 3 and I don't think that partner has a 1st seat opener.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Yes, it could be 3 cards, but then opener will have a chance to bid NT on a 5332 hand
knowing responder has almost an opening hand.
As you know, the rule of 20 says: 
add your HCP to the lengths of your 2 longest suits, and if the total is at least 20, it's a minimum opener.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|
I prefer the rule of 22: In addition to the rule of 20 count, add your quick tricks. 
If the total is at least 22, then you have a minimum opener.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So by either evaluation, North has a minimum opener.
So 1@h - 1NT / 2@D - 3@d makes sense.  If opener has a better hand, she will bid 3NT over 3@d.
And note: playing a stuffed 4-3 fit (stuffed = lots of honors) with the hand holding 3 cards and a ruffing value is often 
the winning spot.

at|mitche:  Play:  Opening lead was the @S5, 4th best, which seems like a good idea. 
Neither North nor South bid spades, so chances are pretty good that neither of them has 4 of the suit.  
And we like to lead unbid majors instead of unbid minors. 

What's declarer's plan?|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


at|
He has between 1 and 3 spade winners, 4 diamonds, and has to develop 3 more tricks.  
Where are declarer's tricks going to come from?|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Well, declarer should play small from dummy at trick 1, as that will tell him whether he has 1, 2 or 3 spades.  
If the 9 forces the Jack from east, he can finesse west for the "other honor" the K. When honors split = 2 tricks 
If it forces the K from east = 2 spade tricks,    and 3 @s-tricks if KJ in west.
Playing the Q will never gain you 3 tricks, => with a double finesse: lowest card first just in case both in west (25%).
(When honors split, it doesn't matter whether you play the Q or 9, 50% chance for 2 tricks) Totals 75% for 2 or more.
Only 1 trick of course if KJ in East...but the opening lead does not suggest that scenario.
|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt||at|A 3-3 heart split (36% probability) will generate 2 hearts, still leaving us 1 trick short.  
We need the spade finesse or the @CAce favorably located.  
In short, we need a lot of luck.|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


at|
When the @s9 loses to the Jack, what should East do? |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


at|
I would shoot back another @s |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Declarer now has 2 spades, 4 diamonds, and he needs 2 more tricks.  
So he should go after hearts. A 3-3 @h split is a better chance than nothing.  
And since any 3-3 split works, it doesn't matter whether the lead is from dummy or declarer's hand, 
so he should lead a @h from dummy at trick 3 (assuming a @S came back at trick 2).

MM: By clicking on the cards, you can play the hand Double Dummy.

|
at|mitche:  Bidding:  West's 2@c bid seems a bit eccentric.  
Even though West's hand is very strong, the 'book" bid is 1@s - we like to find 4-4 major fits if possible.  
I promise you that the bidding will not die at 1@s.
realrowdy:  I was reading Lawrence today and he said to make a 2/1 bid over Diamonds I just go to 2@C.

(note: Lawrence assures that he never advocated this) |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: There is a value to establishing a game force, yes, but you would like to show your 4-card major unless 
you have a specific agreement on how to find a fit after 2@c   (as when 2@C is a conventional bid).|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


at|
To see why I say this, imagine that East's hearts and spades were reversed.  Now 4@s is almost 100%. 
Also, if you use 2@c as an artificial GF, you must alert it.
Marty Bergen has a discussion of 2@c over 1@d in one of his booklets, but he also says it shows clubs. 
Here West doesn't have clubs.  |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  After 2@c, East began to bid out her pattern with 2@h - 
Some pairs play that after a 2 over 1 GF response, the reverse just shows hand pattern and no extra values.  
Others play that it shows a stronger hand and is slammish.  
I think that both methods have value, but I prefer to bid my hand pattern in a GF auction. |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


at|
Here, East has an aceless 16 count with a doubtful spade value and a long, weak suit, 
so I guess she was bidding out her hand pattern.|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  What was 3@s, Vee? Asking for a spade stop?
veeree:  Yes,  to bid 3NT with spade stop.
mitche:  OK - if East had a spade stop, she would have bid 3NT on her own.|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


at|
BILAsst10: If Liza bids 1@S how should the bidding go?
mitche:  In standard bidding: 1@d - 1@s.  
Then East has a bit of a problem because the hand is stronger than a 1NT rebid, and not really strong enough for a reverse.
2@d shows 6 of 'em, so I would improvise with 2@c over 1@S.|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So we have 1@D - 1@S/ 2@c - 2@h (FSF)/ 2NT  - and West will bid 3@d (best) or 3NT.  
Why 3@d? Imagine that East has the @hAce and not the @HKQ, now 6@d is iced.  
But East still aceless, so over 3@d she will bid 3NT and that should be that.|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


nt||at|
Someone asked about a 2@d inverted minor bid. 
I do not know a single pair that would use an inverted minor raise while holding an undisclosed 4-card Major.  
2@c is better than 2@d here.
After West's strong bidding, if East has 3 key cards (2 aces and the @DK or 3 aces), she should look for slam. 
But with just 1 key card, 3NT is best over 3@d in the sample auction.

at|mitche: Play: If 2@h showed a genuine suit, then I think I would have tried a spade opening lead.  
In general, I think it's losing bridge to lead one of dummy's naturally bid suits, unless you really have the goods in it.
After the heart lead, declarer has 9 tricks, no matter how the opposing cards are sitting.  
The location of the @hAce guarantees a 10th trick, and the defenders can always arrange to win 2 spades and a heart.

at|mitche: Bidding: West should bid 2@s (reverse) instead of 2NT.    
We do not like to hide 4-card Majors, especially when they have 3 honors.  
Also, that club Qx is a pretty thin club stopper.
If West bids 2@s, East will rebid her hearts, and West will raise to 4.  
Then, South should lead the unbid suit, clubs.. 
(remember, don't help declarer by leading one of dummy's suits).|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


nt||at|
Anyway - after 2NT, East's 4@h bid was correct. 
Her suit will play well as trumps, even opposite a small singleton.  
Suggested auction: 1@d-1@h / 2@s-3@h / 4@h

at|mitche: Bidding: Well, we had some fireworks here,  4@h and 4@s were "book" bids.
Mike Lawrence says, "if you have a choice of bids and 4@s is one of the choices, bid it."

East properly pushed to 5@h (it is down just 1),  and South doubles, also correct.
Should North pull the double?  I think it's close.  
With no defense and a big spade fit, it might be right to bid on    because 
North doesn't know if South has 5@h set in hand with no chance for making 5@s. |
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  That was the case here.  I really don't know what I would do at the table with North hand. 
It depends on my guess of the state of the match or how my matchpoint game is going.

at|mitche:  Play:  But we find ourselves in 5@s with West leading the singleton club.  Good start for the defense.
Declarer plays 2 rounds of trumps and her remaining club honor.
East now knows that West began with 2 black singletons, and almost surely 8 hearts, therefore,    3 diamonds.
If Declarer has the @DKQ, there is no defense, so East has to put one of those honors in the West hand.
Do you all follow the reasoning that East would use to count out the hand?|
pg| ***** 98 ***** |


nt||
at|vtveny:  My mistake, before playing a @C I should play @D.
mitche:  Absolutely correct.    Key point here is the reasoning that allows East to figure out the distribution 
and the reasoning leading to the killing defense.|

sk||

at|mitche: Bidding: Depending on your style for overcalls, West might want to bid 2@s instead of 1, esp. if you play MP
Without the intervening bid, North might have used Drury (or just blasted), 
but with the intervening spade bid North has a better call than 4@h.  

A possibility is 2@s to show a limit raise in hearts.  My preference is 2@s.|
pg| ***** 103 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: Note that 2NT by North would NOT be a conventional heart raise, 
but rather a natural 10-11 point bid with spades stopped and (probably) 2 hearts.|
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


at|
East may want to bid over 4@h.     With just 1 heart and West's announced absence of defense, 
4@s at favorable vulnerability would be a very good idea.
We are at 4@h.

at|mitche:  Play:  West led the @D6.
West does better not to lead the singleton here.  Why? |
pg| ***** 119 ***** |


at|
West has a natural trump trick. 
Should East have the @DAce AND an outside ace, then West might get 2 ruffs, 
but it seems very unlikely that East would have that much when the opponents voluntarily bid to a game over an overcall.
|
pg| ***** 120 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: So I guess to lead something else - best being a club, and hope declarer decides to finesse twice in trumps.
Of course, with 10 trumps, I doubt that declarer will finesse twice in trumps once they split.
East did well not to put up the @DK at trick 1.  
Declarer played the @HA and conceded a club.
Declarer then stripped out the black suits, ending in hand and led the @DA which was RUFFED. |
pg| ***** 121 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Declarer later lost a diamond, making 4 on the nose. 
A better idea for declarer is to play a trump after she removes all the black cards.
As it happens, West wins the trump and must yield a ruff-sluff (or lead a @D if she has one).|
pg| ***** 122 ***** |


at| 
Once West leads a black card, declarer should guess to put the @DK in East's hand and finesse for 11 tricks.
gypsy1308: But I hate using 2 to get 1 higher. |
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Well, yes, most of the time you would not waste 2 trumps to pull 1, but here you have 
plenty of trumps and the opening lead of a @D looks very much like a singleton after the @S bid.  
After all, what did West bid on?

at|mitche: Bidding:  The bidding was a shade undercooked -- or, if you prefer, half-baked 
How did they miss a cold game with excellent slam chances?
East's hand has 4 losers and a very sound 6 card @D suit... so 1@d is right opening bid.
After the 2@s overcall (which I do not particularly like), West decided to pass.
East has a hand worth about 20-21 total points in either clubs or @D, so a non-forcing 3@c is an underbid.|
pg| ***** 126 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: East may reopen with a forcing 3@s.    West will bid 3NT, almost surely, and now, 
4@c should not be Gerber or Stayman, but a suit.
If East had hearts and a big hand, he bids 3@h over (2@s-pass-pass)|
pg| ***** 127 ***** |


at| 
So 3@s should deny 4 hearts. 
If East were interested in 3NT, he passes 3NT and so 4@c must be forcing, showing clubs and @d's.
West loves his @CAce but should just bid 4@D, and East will bid 4@h, a cue bid. |
pg| ***** 128 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  West bids 4@s, East signs off in 5@d and West should raise to 6, looking at the @CAce.
Someone wonders if East can expect that strong a hand. 
Well, I think after the preemptive 2@s, West could hold a fairly good hand with spades, hoping for a reopening double.
As East, I would push for a vulnerable game, and when you cue bid 4@h, West knows her points are all working.
This is not an easy slam to bid. |
pg| ***** 129 ***** |


at|
The key to it is for East to recognize that his hand is worth about 20 points after the @S preempt 
and even with the false preference in @D, worth 1 move toward slam.|
pg| ***** 130 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Why do I not like the 2@s call?
A) South has a lot more strength OUTSIDE the @S suit than in it.  
A preempt with 7 HCP outside your suit will never allow your partner to know if he should defend or take a save.
B) I understand the destructive value of 2@s,  but I also think that in the long run, you do better in second seat not to preempt with an outside A or K - at least not very often, because your partner still could have a good hand.|
pg| ***** 131 ***** |


at|  
Imagine that North had something like Kxx, xxxxx, x, and KQxx - now you make 3@s.  And that is just with 8 points. 
If you preempt, that hand might bid 4 (taking an advance save) when the opps don't make game.

at|mitche:  Play:  East played the hand well, choosing to ruff 2 clubs in dummy.
Trying to get 2 club discards on the @SAK runs the risk that North would ruff small, killing the discard 
with a @h loser left.

Thanks to Eileen for her generous assistance and to all of you for your courteous attention and
participation.
MM: You can play the hand Double Dummy if you wish
