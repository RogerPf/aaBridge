We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.
We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned SAYC, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|
at|^b@2^*BForcing 1NT Responses ^*N

We will discuss bidding after forcing 1NT responses. 

Point 1:
A 1NT response to 1@h or 1@s could be as weak as 5 or 6 HCP up to 12 points. 
So opener's first job is to limit her hand. 

Let's review hand strengths: 
A MINIMUM opening bid is anything up to about a bad 16 points; 
An INVITATIONAL opener is about 16 to 18;
A STRONG opener is 19+ points. 

(I recommend that you open all  (15-17) 5332 shape, with 1NT. 
This solves some miserable rebid problems)
For example, holding   @sxx   @hAK10xx   @dAxx   @cKQx   (with 15-17 HCP)
1@h - pass - 1@s - pass - ??      you have no good rebid! Open 1NT and not 1@h

So let's assume that opener began with 1@h or 1@s in first or second seat and responder bids 1NT.

In most cases, responder will not have as much as 3-card support for opener’s Major, 
so our rebid structure is designed to keep the bidding low enough to find a fit in a different suit.

Opener must be careful about jumps, else the auction may become very awkward. 
The 3-level is an uncomfortable place to be looking for a fit. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

In the following discussion, we assume that responder bids 1NT after your opening 1@h or 1@s bid 

With a ^*uminimum opener^*n (at most 15 points), opener’s rebids are as follows:

a) Rebid the opening Major with a 6-card suit. (Note: with 6 of your Major and a lower-ranking 4-card suit, 
bid the 4-card suit and then rebid the 6-card Major to show a hand with 14-17 points.)
example:   @sKJxxxx    @hAQx   @dQ10x   @cx             opener rebids 2@s.  
With          @sKJxxxx    @hx       @dKQxx    @cKx          also rebid 2@S.
But with    @sKQ10xxx  @hx      @dAQxx    @cKx          bid 2@d, planning to rebid spades on your third bid.

b) If opener has 5+ spades and 4+ hearts, she rebids 2@h 

c) If opener has just a 5-card Major and a balanced hand, she rebids her longer minor. 
With equal strength and length in the minors, I prefer to bid 2@c. 
If opener has specifically 4=5=2=2 shape, she rebids 2@C.  
This, because responder is obligated to bid 1@s if she has 4 of them.  
This is the ONLY time you bid a 2-card minor over a forcing 1NT.
To avoid the problem of rebidding a 2-card suit, some pairs use the Flannery convention, which I do not 
recommend; I am willing to play in the unlikely 2-4 fit to keep 2@d as a natural weak 2.

d) This structure allows responder to correct to 2 of opener’s Major with a doubleton and a hand not strong 
enough to invite game.   Examples: opener’s hand is   
@sQx       @hKQJxx   @dAxx   @cQxx     -- rebid 2@d (equal length but stronger minor **)
@SAQxxx   @hKQxx    @dJxx   @cx        -- rebid 2@h 
@sAQxxx   @hKQx     @dxxx   @cKx       -- rebid 2@d  (your longer minor)

Responder will take a "false preference" with a 2-card support for your Major. 
Example: opener bids 1@S, you the resoponder holding (@s97, @hK10xx, @dQxx, @cJxxx) bid 1NT (forcing), 
opener rebids 2@d, your rebid is 2@s
(** MM: Others may suggest:  "with 3-3 in the minors bid @c's")
|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
With a ^*umedium opener^*n, opener’s rebids are as follows:

- With a sound 6-card Major that can play for 1 loser opposite a singleton (KQJ9xx or better) and 16-18 starting points, jump rebid your suit.        1@s - 1NT / 3@s
Example:  @sxx   @hKQJ10xx   @dAxx   @cAx         1@h - 1NT / 3@h     NOTE: this is ^*uNON-FORCING^*n 

Responder will pass with something like     @sKxx   @hx   @dJ10xxx   @cQxxx    
but with any doubleton support in a 9-loser hand or better, responder should raise. 
Example: @sKxx   @hxx   @dQJxxx   @cQxx 

If responder has the 3-card limit raise for her 1NT response, she raises to game.  Opener has at worst a 
6 loser hand, and the 3-card limit raise has 8 losers, not quite enough to bid past game. 

The jump rebid of 3 of a Major shows about 5-6 losers. With a ^*ustronger hand^*n (17+), you plan to:
a) Raise 1NT to 2NT with a balanced 5332 hand and 18-19 HCP.      (MM: some suggest with 16-18)

b) Jump-shift  (Game forcing)
Sometimes you will jump-shift into a 3-card minor to establish a GF situation -- Example:
@sAKJ10x   @hxx   @dKJx   @cAKJ    (I would like to open 2NT, but my heart holding convinces me otherwise.) 
If partner has enough strength to bid over 1@S with 1NT, I will bid 3@C at my second turn. 
The absence of a 6th spade and my extra strength both make it wrong to bid 3@s over 1NT.

c) Reverse (1 round force). 
So here is what we do with invitational hands:
Note that a reverse is at least invitational, but still can be very strong:  
1@h - 1NT /2@s   where opener might have a hand like: 
@sKJ10x   @hAKJxx   @dK10x   @cx|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
^*bNote on "semi-forcing" 1NT^*n  

When you pass in first seat, partner needs more than minimum strength to explore for game; 
but at the same time, third seat openers may be rather lighter than a first or (especially) second seat 
opening bid. 
For this reason, a lot of players use "semi-forcing" 1NT after partner's third-seat bid of 1 of a Major.  
Opener is allowed to pass with a sub-minimum hand or a balanced minimum. 

So if you play semi-forcing 1NT by passed hand and you open in 3rd seat with @sQJ9xx, @hxx, @dKJx, @cKJx 
you should not feel obligated to rebid 2@c.
This means that if you are a passed hand, you should raise 1@S to 2@s with something like 
@sJxx   @hxxxx   @dKxxx   @cQx         rather than bidding 1NT.  
Because we play Drury, opener will not (or should not) get excited by a single raise by a passed hand.

^*bBack to UNPASSED hands^*n:
Responder's fit showing-bids after a Forcing 1NT 

We agree that responder will never bid a forcing 1NT when holding 4-card or more support for opener's Major. 
We will always use Bergen or Jacoby 2NT to show 4+ card support. 

These are pretty straightforward. 
Your raise of 1@h or 1@s to 2 shows 7+ to a bad 10 dummy points and 3-card support. (constructive) 
With a weaker hand and 3-card support, bid a forcing 1NT and then either pass opener's rebid of 2 M 
or correct to 2 of partner's Major. 

With 3-card support and a good 10 to 12, bid 1NT and then jump-raise to the 3 level. 
Example: 1@s - 1NT / 2x - 3@s     with   @sQ94   @hA2   @dK1064   @cQ983 

 |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
So that is a very brief overview of how you can use 1NT, along with Jacoby and Bergen and Drury to cover the 
3-card raise. 
As a passed hand if I have 10-12 dummy points and 3-card support, I will use 2@C, Drury (2-way reverse).

^*bSummary:^*N 
With fewer than a good 7 points, we show a raise by starting with 1NT response to opener's 1 of a Major 
and then take a preference (at the 2-level).  
With 7+ -> 10+, we raise (CONSTRUCTIVE RAISE).  
With 3-card support and 11-12 support points, 1NT followed by a jump-raise to the 3-level. 
With 3-card support and an unbalanced hand, and 13+ points, make a 2 over 1 bid (GF)
and then a "preference" to opener's Major.

^*BNote on responder's 13-15 balanced hands.^*N  
We use Jacoby 2NT to show a game-forcing raise of opener's Major 
(Jacoby always shows 4+ card support). 
That means you can't use 2NT to show a 13-15 HCP balanced hand with 3-card support
e.g. @sJxx, @hAxx, @dAxx, @cKQxx. 
So, we agree that 1@h -> 3NT (or 1@S -> 3NT) 
shows EXACTLY: 3=3=3=4 or 3=3=4=3 shape and 13-15 HCP. 

We NEVER make this bid with a 4-card Major and we NEVER make it with a doubleton.  

So what do you do with a ^*bbig balanced hand^*n, say @sAxx, @hKQx, @dKJ10x, @cKJx  (17 HCP)? 
Answer: respond 1NT and then jump to 3NT, showing 16+|

OK - Here is the problem 2 over 1 players face: 
If you open 1@H or 1@S in first or second seat, and partner responds 1NT, you may not pass
Period. 
Pard could have any of a couple of dozen different hand patterns, including support, 
or perhaps a void in your suit.
Your first priority for rebidding after 1@S - 1NT is to limit your hand's strength
Recall that a minimum opener has a maximum of 15 HCP, and an "invitational" hand has 16-18; 
a strong opener has 19-21 points
So your first rebid helps decide which range you are in:

- A 2-level bid below 2 of your Major shows a minimum - to - invitational hand

- Rebidding 2 of your Major says you have a ^*B6-card^*N suit and a minimum hand.
Example: 1@S - 1NT / 2@s       with: @sKJ10xxx   @hKxx   @dAx   @cQx 

- If you have opened 1@S and you have 4 hearts (or more) you will usually bid 2@H with a minimum
There are exceptions - but for now, we won't worry about them.

- If you do not have 6 spades or 4 heart when you open 1@S, you will bid your longer minor suit
Sometimes, that will be a 3-card suit.   Example   @sKJ10xx   @hAxx   @dxxx   @cAx
Even tho it's very, very ugly, the correct rebid is 2@D - responder will know you may have a cruddy suit.
How many points does that 2@D bid promise? 
You may have as many as 15 points.
With 15-17 and a balanced hand, you open 1NT - even with a 5-card Major
So the 2@C or 2@D bid promises a minimum balanced hand. OR
You might have as many as a good 16 if your hand is unbalanced (unfit for a 1NT opener)

Example:    @sAQJxx   @hxx   @dKx   @cAJ10x   is a pretty decent hand, but the correct rebid is still just 2@C 
 |

nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

There is another reason for bidding a better minor .. if partner is on lead, he may get a better idea of what to lead... 

OK - so what does 1@S - 1NT / 2NT show???
Cliff228: too strong to open 1NT
mitche: With 20, we open 2NT - so this bid shows 18 points, or a very bad 19
Exactly right, Cliff -- it shows a hand too good to open 1NT
Remember that pard promises 6 HCP .. 

So the auction 1@S  1NT / 3NT shows a good 19, 5332 shape, and at least partial stoppers in every suit
It is NOT a shutout bid, since pard can still correct your 3NT to 4 of your Major with 3-card support and a ruffing value

Now, one other sequence: 
You open 1@H and partner bids 1NT
If you play Flannery (I hope you do not. Really), then 1@H - 1NT/ 2@S shows 4 spades, 5 hearts, and about 16 HCP
Otherwise you lose the spade suit. And that is really bad.. 
(now where did I put that blasted spade suit? Under the couch? is it still in the card holder???)

But let's suppose that you don't play Flannery.. 
then there are 2 ways to show a strong hand:
(other than raising 1NT to 2NT) 

- To show a strong unbalanced hand, you may reverse with 2@S over 1@H
(this may show any of a variety of hand patterns, 1 round forcing) 

- Or you may jump-shift into 3 of a minor.. (GF) 
But note, if you bid 3@C or 3@D over 1NT forcing you should have an unbalanced hand. 
Something like this:     @sx   @hKQ10xx   @dKJx   @cAQJx
This is about a minimum hand for this jump shift. 
Since pard did not bid 1@S, you either have a heart or a minor suit fit|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
^*bOther odds and ends^*n:
 
1@S - 1NT / 3@S - shows an invitational (16-18) point hand with 6 spades
and 1@S - 1NT/ 4@S shows a 6+ card suit with about 19-20 points (just below a 2@C opener)

^*bResponder's 3-card limit raise in 2 over 1^*n

Here is the problem:
When you raise 1@S or 1@H to 2, you promise 7-9 dummy points and a 3-card support. 
If you play Bergen raises (I think you should), 
then you have a problem showing this kind of hand:

{|ih|pSA62 HJ97 DAQ94 CT65|at|}|at|


A 3-card support and 10-12 dummy points
What is the answer?
Playing 2 over 1, you can use forcing 1NT to handle this problem. 
Responder bids 1NT, forcing

Here is the point I am driving toward .. 
How do you distinguish between 3- card and 4- card raises of 1@H or 1@S|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||fp||cp|2|cs|1|at|^b@2 

The usual way to do this is as follows:

a) with 3-card support and 7-9 dummy points, raise 1@H (1@S) to 2
b) with 4 card support and 7-9, use a Bergen raise to 3@C
c) with 3-card support and 10-12 HCP, start with 1NT (if you are an unpassed hand)
d) with 4-card support and 10-12 dummy points - if you are an unpassed hand, bid 3@D, Bergen 

e) If you are a passed hand, use DRURY (2@C) to show a 3-card limit raise (10-12 dummy pts)
f) If you are a passed hand with 4-card support and 10-12 dummy points, bid 2@D (Drury)

^*bOpener's responses to Drury 2@C (3-card) and 2@D (4-card) limit raise passed hands are^*n:

- If you opened 1@s weak in third seat, you rebid 2@S 

- If you bid 3@S, you are asking responder to bid game with 11+ or 12 dummy points
  (some people play 3@S rebid by opener as a general slam try. Check with partner)

- If you have a full opener with no slam interest, just bid 4 of your Major.

- ANY NEW SUIT bid by opener is 100% forcing to game and is a genuine second suit; 
  It shows extra values and invites responder to control bid with fitting cards in the second suit

All of the fit-showing bids (3@C, 3@D Bergen, and Drury) 
are ALERTABLE and should be discussed w/partner before using them

(MM: And some use Bergen and or Drury reversed)|

This concludes Mitch's notes
The hands that follow are a selection of hands played during Mitch's sessions in the BIL
All are more or less related to the subject.
But please do not forget that after each hand is played, Mitch gives VERY valuable insights on the PLAY of the hand as well!
Quiz questions are during bidding and/or play
To get the most out of these movies work through each hand from start to finish 
Hope you enjoy our new format and that it proves more useful to you!

at|mitche:  Bidding:  North has the ugly hand for 1NT forcing response.
The "book" bids are to rebid a 6 card major, or if you opened 1@S and have 5 spades and 4 hearts, to rebid 2@h, or if you 
don’t have either of those to bid your longer minor.  But bidding 2@D on that holding is pretty disgusting.  So if North 
cannot tolerate the idea of 2@D, she might choose a different lie: either 2@s (pretend a club was stuck in your spade suit)
or 2@C - pretend a @D was stuck in your clubs.  
I'd prefer the 2@C lie, as it gives you the best chance of landing on your feet, but I would also understand and sympathize
with 2@D.|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Here, 2NT shows a hand with 5 spades and MORE THAN a 1NT opener, i.e. about a very good 17 to a 
middling-good 19.       So North must not advertise that much more than she has.
ecolodge:  Knew it was the wrong bid . . .  just stuck.
mitche:  Yes, you had a tough rebid:  2@d or 2@C (a white lie).  Now, after 2NT, South guessed to bid 3@h.  
First, if 2NT was the correct bid, then North should have raised 3@h to 4@h.  
But here, I think that North could and should pass with 3 hearts and a minimum hand.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Rule: after a natural NT rebid by opener, responder's suit bids are all natural. (There might be exceptions, 
but for now, assume that responder has the suit he bids.)
azin: What would be the correct rebid by North?
mitche:  2@D or 2@c (a white lie). If she had better 5 card spade suit (say AKQ86), she might choose to fib by rebidding 2@S.

at|mitche:  Play:  When the small club comes down - declarer has to guess if West led from the @CA or the @CQ. If he guesses 
right by putting in the @CK, he goes down 1 trick less.  East, when she wins the @CQ must play the @C10 at trick 2, not
the 4. Playing the 4 blocks the suit. 
If South has the @DA, West may never be able to get back in to cash the club suit.  If South has the J8x, well that's too
bad, but also, the rule of 11 tells East that South began with just 2 clubs higher than the 5. So the 10 cannot cost.

at|mitche:  Bidding:  I am fine with the bidding through 2@D.  East shows a hand with long diamonds and not much else.
When West hears that bid, she should think "East's dummy might be completely worthless."  So, she might content herself 
with 2@s instead of 3.  
3@s should show a very sound spade suit, something at least as good as @sKQ109xx and preferably even stronger, because 
she can't count on even a single spade in dummy.  And dummy's diamond suit is not likely to be of any use to west.

at|mitche: Play:  With West having announced strength in the black suits and no love of diamonds, a heart lead seems in order.
Here a diamond lead turns out to set up an unlikely winner in the @DJ for declarer.  A heart also costs a trick, we note, 
but on balance, you will do better not leading a known long suit in dummy.  The principle you need to remember: dummy 
promised long diamonds and not much else.
ecolodge:  If I lead a low @H, Mitch, doesn't that let declarer have 3 @H tricks?
mitche:  Yes, a heart costs a trick. But the @D set up the @DJ for her.|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  When declarer won trick 1 by ruffing, she properly played the @CK, which was allowed to win.  I think she does
better to play a second round of clubs.  This puts the defense in a difficult situation.  A trump shift from North eliminates
a loser for declarer (finesses South's spade Q essentially).  And not playing a trump  allows declarer to ruff her small 
club and then discard a losing heart on the @DJ.  Another point of play:  Declarer decided to ruff South's diamond lead 
when she got in with a trump. Better is to use the @DJ to absorb a loser.  Discard on the second @D.

|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


at|mitche: Bidding:  How should N/S bid to get to their high-percentage game?
Let's start with South, who evaluated her hand as a limit raise in spades.
How many losers does South have? Eight losers.  Clearly, this is a limit raise (or maybe better).
How about North?  Six losers.
What should North do after 1NT?  She should make an invitational bid and I prefer 3@S.  This is a suit that will play 
for 1 loser opposite a singleton 10 or a small doubleton.|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  If you prefer to evaluate in Bergen points, you get something like 14 HCP less 2 for the doubtful value in 
hearts plus a couple for shortness, and 1 for quality spade suit + 5 for spade length.  Enough for a game invite.  
So 3@s seems about right.  And South would happily accept an invite.
Another way to look at it: South could pass 2@S but raised. That shows at least 9-10 points.
North now can reevaluate and add points for spade length and distribution. Either way, North can bid more strongly.|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Even if E/W attack clubs, declarer can take at least 10 tricks: she finesses twice in clubs to ditch her 
diamond losers.  Once the defenders go after diamonds, declarer has no further problems.

sk||at|mitche:  Bidding:   There is an old Bergen say:   "5-5 come alive."
North, holding spades and 5-5 shape, should consider bidding 2@h (cue) over 1NT to show spades and a minor. And then, after considering it, she should do it.  N/S will discover their double fit and compete to 3@S, which on the expected heart lead, will probably make or go down just 1. 
 
ecolodge:  3@S would be a better contract than 3@D?

mitche:  If you can buy it at 3@D, maybe, but you will probably get pushed to 3@s.  West could have passed 2@C or bid 2@h.|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  (I think 2@h would be a better idea, since 2@C could have been bid on a 3-card suit).  A raise to 3@C shows 
about 10 dummy points and is looking for 3NT.

at|mitche:  Play:  There were a couple of issues:
First:  the @s opening lead was probably best (based on the bidding, I think it was absolutely correct).  When East wins
the @SA and plays trumps, South should win the ace and play a couple rounds of trumps.
Second: when defense did not pull trumps, declarer used dummy's last trump to ruff a heart winner. Declarer can count
hearts as follows: "I have 7 hearts, and the defenders followed to 2 rounds, so when I play the @hQ, just 2 hearts remain
out. |
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  If they both fall under my queen, there are no more hearts out and both of those in my hand are winners.  If
hearts split 4-2, one ruff will establish my 5th heart. If you don't count out the entire hand, at least count the suit(s)
you are trying to set up.

at|mitche:  Bidding:  E/W were OK up to 2@D.  East's 2@h bid says "bad hand, long hearts."  She actually has a goodish 
hand and not quite good enough hearts for a 3@h rebid.  A better idea would be to rebid 2NT to show 10-12 (probably 11-12) 
and a mostly balanced hand.  
West may  - rebid 3@D (East passes that at IMPs),  or pass with a balanced minimum   or  bid 3NT with a max ( 14+ points)
xxdouble:  Isn’t 2@S a better contract than 3@D?
mitche:  Well, yes, but if East bids 2@h, West is 100% correct to pass, expecting weak hand with long hearts. 
And you cannot play 2@S if East bids 2NT.  |
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: If East bid 2@s over 2@D it would show a hand like @s94, @h107642, @DK10x, @CKxx.  
But East is an Ace better, so 2NT is her best rebid.

pg| ***** 107 ***** |


at|mitche:  Bidding:   North decided to pass (good idea, first seat) and East bids 1@h.  What should West do?|
pg| ***** 108 ***** |


at|
Let's look at what 3@h usually means: It shows either a weak raise (if you play Bergen, which I recommend you do), 
or it's limit (showing 10-12 dummy points and 4-card support).  
Please remember that an immediate response at the 3-level (either weak, limit or Bergen Raise) always shows 4-card support.
So we would like not to do that either. Now, is West's hand strong enough to force to game opposite a minimum opener?  
Count losers. |
pg| ***** 109 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  The hand has 9 of them, which is not enough to insist on game.  And 4333 shape is no plus, either.  
So a 2 over 1 response is also a risky proposition.  That leaves just 1NT forcing.
So West should bid a forcing 1NT, because that's the only thing left.  And West will jump-raise to the 3-level next time, 
no matter what East bids. If East shows a strong hand (say with 3@C or 3@d), West can come to life.
So the auction might be: 1@h - 1NT / 2@h (min opener, 6 hearts, maybe more) 3@h (10-12 dummy points, 3 hearts).  
And East would be charmed with her 6 losers to bid game. |
pg| ***** 110 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: One other note: usually a limit raise shows about 8 losers, but West has 2 good cards not accounted for in 
Losing Trick Count, the @SJ and @H10, both of which are supporting higher honors, plus most of her points are in Aces
and Kings.
Especially in suit contracts, when you are A/K/10 rich and not a lot of quacks, you are justified in bidding a bit more 
aggressively.

at|mitche:  Play:  declarer always has 10 tricks, and the @S lead solved that suit for her, giving her 11 tricks.  
One very minor point:  Since declarer has no problems with transportation, she may as well play off the spades before leading to dummy's @CK.  
Here it does not matter in the least, but I wanted to make the point about stripping safe exits.  As a general principle, 
if you can remove safe exit cards from defenders, you will do better to do so. Your play of clubs before diamonds was 
absolutely correct.

really has a black 2-suiter, she will bid 4@c and then they will get to 5@C, if that is right.  
Keep that idea tucked in the back of your mind. After a jump shift to 3@C, responder should bid a stopper if he doesn't 
have support for opener's Major.

at|mitche:  Play:  At matchpoints, you can make a case for declarer leading a heart to dummy to take a spade finesse. 
But once the @DK has been established, declarer should try to limit her losers to 1 trump when they divide 3-2 by just 
playing the @SA and K. If trumps are 4-1, she can then try to split the club suit for a heart discard.  The risk in 
crossing to dummy with a heart to take a finesse is that it allows the defenders to cash a heart, scoring 2 trumps, the 
@DA and the heart that declarer allowed them to make (and which they did not take).|

at|mitche: Bidding: North has a bit of a rebid issue after 1NT. Possible bids are 2NT or 2@S.   
There's something to be said for both bids. 
2NT accurately describes opener's strength but if South is something like  @sJxx  @hx  @Dxxx  @cKQJxxx
4@s may be the best game.  
On the other hand, if South has the actual hand, then 2@s gives South a headache.
As far as North hand's strength, I think that as 17 HCP hands go, this is a pretty nice one, and I don't mind the reverse or 2NT (both of which show at least this much strength).      This is a very upgradable hand.|
pg| ***** 144 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: Someone asked if North might make an offshape 1NT opening.  I think that this hand is too good to bid 1NT.  
Also, if you are bidding an off-shape 1NT, you should do so with shortness in the Majors.  
That is, the 1NT takes away the 1 level so the opps cannot get a cheap 1@h or 1@S call in.  Good question.|

at|mitche: Play: east got the defense off to a good start with a small trump. He doesn't want to give declarer an easy 
trick in the minors or pick off partner's possible spade honor and surrender a tempo, the time for declarer to get spades
going.  Also, the bidding suggests that South might expect to ruff a spade.. so leading trumps might kill a spade ruff.
At trick 1, declarer should play the Queen, not small from dummy.
Why?
If West plays the J or 10, then the Ace will be forced out at trick 1 and the now-singleton Q will get captured by the K.
I would guess that East miss clicked at trick 2 on the trump suit.|
pg| ***** 159 ***** |


nt||pf|y|
at|mitche:  What should be declarer's plan for 10 tricks?  She has 4 spades and the @CA = where are her other 5 tricks 
coming from?  She must expect 2 losers in @D and at least 1 in trumps, and barring a minor (suit) miracle, at least 1 club
loser.  I would try this: @HQ at trick 1.  If it lives, trump ace and another trump.  Then, a small club toward the queen, 
without cashing the @CA first.  A sleepy East may decide to play small and allow declarer to steal a club trick.  There's 
no other play that gives declarer any chance...  In fact, declarer might even try a “sneakier line."   
Win the @HQ at trick 1, and a small club at trick 2, followed by the trump and a small spade to dummy, then the club Queen.|
