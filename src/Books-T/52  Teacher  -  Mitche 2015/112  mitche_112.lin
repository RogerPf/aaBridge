mn|Introduction|
fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back 
yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned SAYC, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."
Mitch Edelman aka mitche 


MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.

qx|Xtra,T|mn|Convention Card: Opening 2-level|
tu||
fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Convention Card: Opening 2-Level  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|^b@2
Filling out the Convention Card:  The Front of the Card: Opening 2-level:
A word about agreements. Unless you play something pretty odd, 2@c is strong, forcing, and artificial. It should show 
a hand with enough playing strength to be able to play at the 3-level opposite a bust, or at most 4 losers; 
I also think that the 2@C bid usually shows at least 6 "controls" (where A = 2 and K = 1 control). 
Examples of strong 2@c hands:  Which of these hands open 2@C?

1: @sAKJ109x   @hx   @DKQJx   @CAKx

Answer: Clearly enough stuff--21 HCP and 4 losers. 

2: @sQx   @hKQJ10xxx   @DAKJx   @CQ

Answer: Will make 4@h opposite as little as an Ace.  But the lack of controls makes me cautious (with an Ace and 
2 Kings, responder would think about slam). Open this hand 1@H. 

3: @sKQJx   @hAx   @DKQJx   @CAQx

Answer: Open 2@C and rebid 2NT.  That sequence shows 22-24 HCP balanced hand (may have 5-card Major -- use 
puppet stayman in this sequence) 2@C - 2@d / 2NT.  
Our NT ladder is: 20=21 opens 2NT, 22-24 opens 2@C, rebids 2NT, 25-27 opens 2@C, rebids 3NT.
If you are worrying about hearts... don’t!  Your job is to bid what your hand is, and this looks like 22-24 HCP 
balanced, hence 2@C -> 2NT.  You want to open or rebid NT (after 2@C) whenever your hand is balanced and in range.

You want to learn Puppet Stayman to find 5-3 fits when responder has a 3-card Major and a doubleton outside. 
If the "short" hand is taking a ruff, you want to be in a trump suit with 5-3 fit. Otherwise, if NT is playable, you 
generally take the same number of tricks in 5-3 fit at NT or the Major. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||ht|c|cp|2|at|^b@2
4: @sAx   @hAQJ10xxx   @Dxxx   @CA

Answer:  NOT a 2@C opener, as it has 5 losers (open 1@h and plan to rebid 4@h over most responses).


5: @sAKxx   @hAKQx   @Dx   @CAQxx

Answer: Even with 22 HCP, open 1@C. 4441 hands are very hard to bid, and unless you find a fit, the hand will be 
hard to play.  Plan to raise 1 of a Major to 4 (or splinter to 4@d). 

6: @sAKQ10xx   @hAKQx   @Dx   @Cxx

Answer:  With 6 controls and very strong suits, open 2@C.  So what if you have "only" 18 HCP? You will make game 
when pard has as little as the 2 Major suit Jacks, or 2 hearts and @sJxx.  In this case, you need  hearts to divide 
4-3 or if they are 5-2 with a 2-2 spade split,  or if both suits split poorly, for the long heart to be with the long 
spade, about an 80% chance.  One of my regular partners thinks this hand opens 1@S. He and I discussed it at length. 
The argument for 1@S is to get your suit in before the opponents start pushing the auction with minor suit bids.  
My argument is that partner won't ever compete unless you start with 2@c.

Marty Bergen's latest booklet gives this advice - when you have a powerhouse hand, open 2@c; 
it'll make subsequent bidding easier.
So there it is, our brief overview of 2@C opener.  Now let's look at responding.
First, let's examine what a positive response should be.
You should bid 2@D most of the time.  When you bid 2@H or 2@S you show a decent 5-card suit, KQ10xx or better 
(the suit has 1 loser at most = 2 of the top 3 honors) AND an outside control (A or K).
This is the WEAKEST hand I would ever treat as a positive: @sKQ109x, @hxx, @DKJx, @Cxxx. This hand is good enough 
that opener should think about a slam with any kind of spade fit (Axx or any 4 spades).|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||ht|c|cp|2|at|^b@2
Basically, a positive response to 2@c suggests the strength to look for slam if a fit and controls work.  A positive
shows a good suit and an entry to it. 
Responder should not be in a hurry to bid NT after 2@C opening.  I think it shows 4333, no major, and around 9-10 HCP.
For the 2@C box on 2 bids, we check off "Strong", and 2@D is now a waiting bid.
We use cheaper minor as "second negative." (Some older texts say 2NT should be used as second negative.
Experience teaches that you get into trouble with 2NT by the weak hand.)

NOTE: Some people use 2@h as a super negative over 2@C, showing zero aces/kings, and fewer than 5 HCP. This 
works, but you have to consider that a 2@h supernegative wrongsides hearts when that is the big hand's suit.

We note that 2@C shows at most 4 losers, is forcing for 1 round (only way to stop at 2 level is 2@C - 2@D/ 2N - p).

kat827: How does KQ10xx (above) just have 1 loser?  Wouldn't the A and J win tricks against this holding?
mitche:  We could lose 2 tricks, but we treat a suit w/2 of top 3 honors and length as 1 loser.

Next: weak 2 bids:  2@D, 2@h, 2@S are weak 2's. These bids show between 6-10 HCP and promise a 6-card suit.
If you learn only 1 thing in this lesson, here is the point: YOU MUST AGREE WITH YOUR PARTNER ON YOUR
STYLE FOR OPENING WEAK 2'S. Some expert players (Sabine Auken, one of the world's strongest players, for example)
will open weak 2's on helium.  I saw her open 2@S in first seat on @sJ10xxxx, @hx, @DQxx, @CQJx (no one vulnerable).

Unless you are a world-class declarer, I recommend these 2 ideas:  
First, more of your points should be IN your long suit than outside it. A weak 2 is primarily an OFFENSIVE hand.
Second, avoid preempting with good support for an unbid Major.
You can guess from these remarks that I prefer disciplined weak 2's in first and (especially) second seats.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||ht|c|cp|2|at|^b@2We agree on these treatments of weak 2's:

1: RONF ("Raise Only Non Forcing)
Any raise of a weak 2 is non-forcing. Any new suit by unpassed responder is 100% forcing for 1 round; 
The weak 2 bidder is expected to raise partner's new suit with a 3-card support if it was a Major.  

2: 2NT is FEATURE ASKING. Opener rebids 3 of her suit with a weak suit. With KQ10xxx or better and an outside 
A or K, opener bids the suit with the feature. 
Some pairs use the Ogust convention, which I like, too. But since first/second seat weak 2's are disciplined, you don't gain very much with it, and FA is easier to remember and use correctly.  (If you happen to be Sabine Auken, use Ogust.)

A final word on weak 2's.  My good friend, the late Maryann Dufresne, in her book, "Bridge with bells and whistles"
(a very good book, I might add) said "don't tell the same story twice."  If you stick to disciplined weak 2's, you
have told your entire story with your weak 2 bid. Don't bid again unless responder asks you to.  
So for 2@d, 2@h and 2@s we show for point count, 5-10 (and note, it's pretty rare to open a weak 2 with just 5 HCP).  
We check off 2NT as forcing, and write "Feature Asking."

One note: someone mentioned that they prefer to play new suit as non-forcing. 
I can't be nagging you at the table, so I will do it here: 
It makes life too hard to use 2NT as the only forcing bid.
Here is why:
Suppose your hand is @sAKJxx   @hx   @DKQJx   @CAxx    and pard opens 2@h. 
If 2@s is non-forcing.... you need to bid 2NT and follow up with 3@S, which puts responder under terrible pressure with 
something like @sxxx   @hKQJxxx   @dxx   @cQx   
Game is maybe making.  But it's possible that 3@S is the limit of the hand, and the 2@h opener will never know if it's right to raise or pass.  
You see the problems that making 2@S non forcing introduces?
While:     2@h - 2@s / 3@s (showing a 3-card support) let's responder decide whether to continue or not
(Of course responder bids the new suit to find a better fit, and may or may not want to move on)
OK, let's play some bridge!

at|mitche:  Play:  West has a worthless hand.  When you have a dog like that, you need to think about using your first and
only time on lead most effectively.  Here, unless pard has 4 good clubs, a club lead is not going to produce any tricks.  
And leading a major is also likely to be unproductive.  So lead the @DJ.  
If pard has a 5-card suit, you are helping set it up, and if not, well, nothing lost. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: At trick 1,  East has to play the @CQ, not the 10. You cannot afford to let declarer win a cheap trick with the Jack.  
If he has Jxx, he will anyway, but then you get just 1 club trick anyway. 

(MM: If declarer has the Jxx, would partner lead the 2 from 8642? Or would she have led the 6, a second best from nothing ?
The rule of 11 tells me declarer has 1 card higher than the 2, but I would doubt it to be the J with partner's lead)  |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Later in play, declarer led small toward the @DQ (good play).
East knows West is broke (11 HCP in dummy, 10 in hand, at least 15 in declarer's hand - pard has at most 3).  
So his only hope is to find pard with the @DQ.  However, when he does duck, declarer can squeeze East's hand.  
East has to find 2 discards on the spades. He can spare just 1, a diamond.  Declarer also established the @h2 and did not
cash it.  It is essential to watch the spot cards. When East discarded one and everyone followed to 3 rounds, the @h2 was 
a winner.

at|mitche:  Bidding:  Remember that "don't tell the same story twice" thing?  Who repeated themselves at the table?
grhamzeee:  South.
mitche:  Yep.  The first takeout X shows an opening hand and support for the unbid suits. The second (especially at 
unfavorable vulnerability) shows about an Ace more than an opening hand.  So South’s second double was an overbid.  
She would need another card, maybe the @SQ to justify the second double.  A MINIMUM opening bid is one with <15 points. 
Yes, if North bids a major, the hand will evaluate to more (singleton @D), but if North doesn't have that @SA, 2@S 
can be headed for defeat. |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:   I think that the bidding is fine up to the second X. After that, North should REOPEN with 2@s.  
Also, 1@D is a bit on the brave side, as this is lacking both a Bergen 20 and also 2 quick tricks. 
Most people will pass this hand.

at|mitche:  Play:  East’s opening lead was a small heart.  While you really cannot fault leading partner's suit, East may have
given some thought to a club lead.  In general, if you don't lead partner's suit or make a strong lead (like Ace from AK), 
you advertise great shortness like a singleton.  
Here, the @C opening lead would force declarer to guess to win the @CA and then go after spades else East will score 2 ruffs.  
So the point of this discussion: singleton leads are frequently very successful. Be on the  lookout for a chance to get a ruff. |
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: Warning: if you have 4 trumps, don't look for ruffs. Instead, try to play a "forcing game".

(MM: = Try to make declarer ruff in his long trump hand, so that declarer loses trump control)

at|mitche:  Bidding:  As you know, I suggest using DONT over strong NT openers in both direct and balancing seat.  
So West's bid was to show both Majors.  At least that is how I would have taken it.  
As this treatment is more-or-less standard, you should just mention it to your partner.  
I am going to suggest you agree that DONT (or if you like Cappeletti, then capp) is on in both direct and balancing seats.

at|mitche: Play: When dummy shows up with shortness in spades, North should guess that declarer is planning to cross-ruff. 
When she gets in with the @SK, she wants to lead - a trump!  The trump trick that the defenders sacrifice by leading the suit
at worst is a break-even proposition because declarer loses 2 ruffs.  One other point, now that I think of it:  
At the time declarer led the @S10, she should know that 
a) South still has a spade and 
b) it's smaller than the 10.  So she can ditch a diamond and win one more trick, I think.|

b) we will have an agreement so no confusion, and 
c) the Law of Total Tricks tells us it's safe.
We got to 4@h.

at|mitche:  Play:  How should declarer go after the heart suit?  If the trumps are 2-1, it doesn't matter.
If North has all 3 trumps, it also doesn’t matter because no matter how declarer plays them, she has a heart loser, 
but if South has all 3 trumps, then declarer can pick up the suit without a loser by leading toward the @hK and preserving the
@hAJ in hand for a finesse.
So the proper play is little to the @HK, because it wins in the only case where declarer has a chance to save a trick.
Remember this position!|

at|mitche:  Bidding:  I wonder if we had a Pinochle deck here, with all the bidding going on!  East's double, even at favorable
vulnerability, was pretty light. I think a reasonable minimum for a TO double is 2 defensive tricks and about 11 HCP.  
(That with East's ideal shape for a X.) Also, the lack of texture makes this hand less attractive.  

After South's bid of 1NT, West bid 2@d. I have mixed feelings about this call: it certainly gets the defense off to the best 
opening lead, and the strong 5 card suit can stand a 4-3 split, so those are all plusses,  but the fact that the suit was 
bid by North (left of declarer) means that I will have a harder time picking up the suit.|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: After 2@d, North, who bid all her values with 1@S, probably should pass. 
The Take out double tells her that her Major suit Queens might not be working for her in a NT contract.  
So I think the auction might go something like 1@D - 1@H / 1@S - 1NT/ pass - pass - ??
East might then take some action (not a good idea here).  
If East does anything over 1NT, I would suggest either X or 2@C, with my preference being X.
kat827:  Would that be a takeout X?
|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: I think it's a "do something smart" type of ballancing X, i.e. if you have a good hand, pass, but otherwise bid your best suit.  I don't really like East's moving over 1NT, because  
a) 1-suited takeout X isn’t great idea, and 
b) the auction suggests that N/S don’t have an 8-card fit. No one raised or took a preference.
grhamzeee:  As the bidding went, assuming partner has a legitimate takeout double I think West must double for penalty. 
If it goes badly I talk to partner about takeout doubles.

at|mitche: Play: They are going to have to win tricks on power, and the points are split pretty evenly.  1NT will be hard to
make, let alone 2NT.  Declarer can just about make 1NT if she does everything right (3 hearts, 2 clubs, 1 diamond, 1 spade).
But in practice, 1NT will probably go down 1 trick.
grhamzeee:  With West's 11 opposite partner's takeout double don't you think a penalty double of 2NT is called for?
mitche:  At IMPS, a penalty double of part scores means you think you have a sure set.  At matchpoints, it's more common.
Here, West might very well double, expecting at least a Queen more from East and N/S having misfits.  
So yes, I would double.|

mn|Supplement: Bergen Raises|

fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Supplement: 5 minute lesson on Bergen Raises  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|^b@2
OK, it's already past bidding bedtime. Here is a brief supplement on Bergen raises.
The LOTT (Law of total tricks) says that you're "safe" to bid to a level equal to the number of trumps your side has.
Bergen raises are designed to follow the LOTT.  
When opener begins with 1@h or 1@S, promising 5, responder will bid to 3-level with 4-card support.

Here is the idea (in this discussion responder always has 4-card support for opener's Major): 

With 0-6 HCP (and hopefully side shortness), responder bids 3 of the Major, 
a WEAK bid designed to take up as much bidding room as possible and get to the LAWful level as fast as possible.  
So 1@S - 3@S shows a hand like K10xx, xx, xxxxx, xx      or thereabouts.  

If responder  has 4-card support and 7-9 points, he jumps to 3@C 
so 1@S - 3@C shows a hand like this:  
@sQJxx   @hxx   @DKQxx   @CJ10x    or maybe    @sAxxx   @hxx   @DKxx   @Cxxxx.     But not much more than that.

And finally, 1@S - 3@D shows a 4-card limit raise, about 10-11 dummy points, something like: 
@s10xxx   @hAQx   @Dxx   @CKQxx
Note that if your partnership allows very light opening bids, then you may need to adjust your HCP totals for 
3@C and 3@D up by a point.

And finally, with 4+ trumps and 13+ dummy points, use Jacoby 2NT or Splinter
Splintering:  
If responder has a 4+ card support, a singleton or void, and 13-15 dummy points (counting distribution), a splinter 
is a much better idea than J2NT.
Example:  @sx   @hK10xx   @DAxx   @CKQ10xx    is good enough to bid 3@S over 1@h.
(MM: More than "good enough", I am counting 12 HCP, +1 length, +1 Quality @c, + 3 for the singleton.. = 17-isch, too strong for the splinter)

mitche: That is the 5 minute overview of Bergen
One point: If opener bids 3 of the agreed Major after a Bergen raise, it shows a minimum opener, not good enough to 
invite game.  
After a 3@C Bergen raise, I play that 3@D conventionally asks responder to show an outside control (A/K) and is Game Forcing.  
Some pairs play that 3@D asks responder to bid game on a maximum.  
So check with partner on follow ups to Bergen   3@C and 3@d.  
Bergen bids and follow ups are alertable.

Opener's other bids:  
3 of other major shows 15+ to 17+ points 
3NT = 18+ points

MM: This concludes this presentation, hope you enjoyed, Karen10 & GG_Bridge
