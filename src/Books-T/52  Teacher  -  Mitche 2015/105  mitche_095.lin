fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned SAYC, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."
Mitch Edelman aka mitche 


MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.
Thank you Eileen (wyoming33) for sending the hands and editing the chatlog! @h

at|mitche:  Bidding:  A raise of 1@s to 2@s normally shows 9 losers.  South raised 1@S to 2. He has 9 losers.
North hand has 5 losers.
So, 9+5 = 14,  is that enough for game?|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


at|
Yep.. subtract 14 from 24 and you get 10 tricks. 
So N/S want to get to game.
What was the problem?|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  The @CA was offside and the @HQ was poorly placed.  If E/W hands are exchanged, game makes.  So sometimes even a very good tool like LTC breaks down.  A bit unlucky.
But wait, there's more! 

Let's look at the South hand a bit. It is flat and its honors are unsupported.   One should add 1/2 loser for a Queen
without at least a 10 to support it.  So South could (should) prefer a 1NT bid.  North will bid 3@S over 1NT. South
would then still raise to 4, but at least North would have an idea of dummy's weakness.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So I recommend that with MORE than 9 losers in your hand, prefer 1NT and then support (or show preference) 
for opener's major.

Since dummy has no sure entries at all, her play makes East decide whether to play her king. After all, declarer could 
have xxx of diamonds, in which case playing the K blows a trick.  Well done, declarer.

at|mitche: Bidding:  Not sure that I would have bid 2@d on South hand for these reasons: 
- The @d suit is really thin, you want a better quality suit for a vulnerable second seat 2 over 1 overcall;  
- Sterile shape. If you have a bad suit, you need good distribution to come in at the 2 level, as well as close to an 
opening hand.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


at|
If your partner can be counted on to balance, at IMPS in particular, better to be discreet with that kind of hand.
Be that as it may, South bid 2@d and West made a FREE BID of 2@s.  
West has the strength (at least 10 points) for the bid and a 5-card spade suit. |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  If I were North and pard bid 2@d, I might have preempted to 4@D (this is another reason for not bidding 2@d).
Pard will expect you to have more stuff in your suit and you will get hung out to dry in competitive auctions.
East's bid of 3@h over 2@s is fine.  She would like better spots.
West now has a problem.  She decided to try playing in E/W's 7-card fit 
(this is why East would have liked the @HT9 instead of the @H43)
I think I would also have bid 4@h at the table.   4@h has no hope of making (2 clubs, 2 hearts, and a spade to lose).

at|mitche: Bidding:  After a third seat 1@S bid, South has a pretty clear 2@d bid.  Unlike the last time the bid came up, 
South has a full opening bid and a hefty @D suit headed by 3 of the top 5 honors. 
This is the kind of hand that was made for a 2-level overcall .
If South does bid 2@d, North will raise (with 2@s cue bid, best) and East will never want to bid 3@h, so N/S will play 
some number of @d. 
azin: Would East let them play in 2@D with a singleton and a great hand in majors?|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  The bidding would not die at 2@d.  North has too good a hand to pass.
But yes, if North did pass 2@d, East has enough to bid 2@h.
As Marty Bergen is so fond of saying, "5-5, come alive."
btour:  If I were south I would be thinking NT.
mitche:  After 2@h, South should forget about  NT. The problem is that N/S lack Aces, and by the time they set up clubs, 
E/W have established and run the @h suit.  If you are thinking that South has a 1NT overcall,  
I do not mind the strength (just 14 HCP - the @D suit is adequate compensation for the lack of a jack).|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt||
at|btour:  I mean what happens after the 2@S bid by North?
mitche:  That the hand wants to show its most important feature, the quality @D suit.
2@s by North shows limit raise plus in diamonds.  If South bids 2NT then, North would insist on @D. Especially if you bid 
3@h.  And even if not, North should insist on @d, because South can't have enough stuff in the majors to deal with the fact 
that North has just 2-1 shape in spades and hearts.
btour:  OK,  I just was raising the point that North is offensive and the 2@S bid might suggest more defense to offense 
then it has.|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  North has 1 1/2 QT but is as you say, a pretty unbalanced shape. 
If E/W get frisky, someone will double you all off and I think best defense may hold you to 8 tricks -- 7, if you are 
careless.

sk||

at|mitche:  Bidding:  Let's begin with a reminder of what a reverse is.  A REVERSE is a non-jump rebid (usually by opener) 
at a level higher than 2 of his / her first bid suit.  So 2@h by North was a reverse.
Here is the rule of reverses in 2 over 1. If responder did not make a 2 over 1 (game-forcing response), then a 
reverse shows a strong hand, at least 17 points.
Steve Robinson says the sequence 1@D - 1@S / 2@h promises longer @D than @h, usually 5-4.
There are exceptions to this principle, but they're not all that common.|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Anyway, North's rebid of 2@h showed about 2 kings more than the hand actually held. 
Or as one of my mentors was fond of saying, "Nice hand, Mitch, but where is the hand you promised in the auction?"
So what should North bid over West's double?

ecolodge:  Over West's double (presumably showing @H and a minor), can't North bid 1NT?
mitche:  Over the double  North has an easy pass.  So North should just go quietly over the double. 
BTW, does West have a double of 1@s here?|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  I think no. Here is why:  
a) N/S still have a live auction and East is a passed hand;  b) East will expect more defense.  
1 1/2 quick tricks is not enough to force pard to bid at the 2 level.
This is a better hand to balance with than to bid directly.
So we should see an auction like 1@D – 1@s/ 2@c - 2@s/ pass, pass, and East might think about balancing. 
Or even an auction like 1@d - 1@s (2@h), but X is not something I would do.
btour:  I can't balance over 2@S.|
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


nt||

at|mitche:  Didn't say you should balance.
Why Bob should not balance over 2@S is: his hand has @S length in front of declarer.  The @SK is a defensive value.  
And the @DAQ sitting behind the opening @D bidder also looks like defensive values.

sk||
at|mitche: Bidding:  3@c in second seat is not a good idea for several reasons:  
First, South has an outside 4 card major.  You risk missing easy games in 4@h when you open 3@C.
Second, with 2 aces, South has defensive values.
Third, with only 6 clubs, South cannot stand to be tapped more than once, unless he gets lucky -- So better is to pass. 
Sometimes 3@c will work well, but for every time it does, you'll be losing points unnecessarily at least twice as often.
And probably the most important reason for not bidding 3@c on this type of hand: it destroys your partner's confidence 
in your bidding.  |
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  I haven't talked a lot about partnerships, so please excuse my introducing the conversation this late 
in the evening.
Your most valuable asset at the table is your partner.  S/he has to trust your signals and that your bids show what your 
agreements say they should.
Most partners will be pretty tolerant of an occasional misbid or failure to lead their suit when they overcall, 
but fact is that the best way to ruin your reputation at the table is to break partnership agreements with regularity, or 
to "operate."|
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  I play in 3 expert partnerships, and the 4 of us have in the neighborhood of 20-22000 total master points,
so we have had some success.  The main thing that works for us is not our bidding system. 
It is the fact that we trust each other.
I really want you to start to think, "does this bid or play make sense for our convention card?"
It will help your results to keep track of the bids you make and the outcomes they produce, too. Notice when you get 
buried for -500 or -800 and ask whether it was bad luck, bad play, or failing to be on the same page as pard.
OK, end of my little sermon on the preempt. |
pg| ***** 94 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  After 3@c, East has a perfectly normal balancing X. And West has a perfectly normal spade bid. 
In fact, if East were not a passed hand, I would bid 4@s with West hand.
