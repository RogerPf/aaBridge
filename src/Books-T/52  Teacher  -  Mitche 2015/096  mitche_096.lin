fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back 
yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned SAYC, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."
Mitch Edelman aka "mitche"

MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.

fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2mitche:    ^*BA Brief Overview^*N

Here is the situation:  
Your pard opens 1NT and your RHO butts in with a 2-level bid.   You can:

- pass with a bad hand|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at| 
- Bid a suit at the 2-level is WEAK, as for example    1NT - (2@D) - 2@h     shows 5 or more hearts and less 
  than enough strength to invite game (at most 6 HCP)|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at|
- double with a stack in the overcaller's suit as PENALTY|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|
- cue bid (1NT - (2@S) - 3@s) is Stayman, and it says NO STOPPER in the overcalled suit 
  (cuebid Stayman is very common)|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|
- 2NT, (alertable) demands 3@C by opener, no matter what the NT bidder has opened with.
    - Now, responder can make a DELAYED cue bid as Stayman, but this time it PROMISES a stopper. 
^*bSo you can show a 4-card Major either with or without a stopper in overcalled suit^*N|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|
- If you relay through 2NT and then bid a suit at the 3-level, it is INVITATIONAL
  (Your suit is HIGHER ranking than the overcalled suit:  1NT - (2@d) - 2NT - (p) / (3@c) - (p) - 3@h   )|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|
- If you relay to 3@C (as responder by bidding 2NT) and bid a suit at the 3-level, that you could not bid at the 
  2-level, it is also weak:      1NT - (2@h) - 2NT - (p) / (3@c) - (p) - 3@d
  (Your suit is LOWER ranking than the overcalled suit)|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


at|    
- Bidding a LOWER ranking suit at the 3-level without relaying through 2NT is invitational (and not GF)|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|
- A jump to the 3-level in a HIGHER ranking suit:   1NT - (2@d) - 3@H    is GAME FORCING.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


at|
- Jump bid to 3NT directly as in 1NT - (2@d) - 3NT shows strength for 3NT, but NO stopper.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|
- And finally if you have a stopper and relay thru 2NT and then bid 3NT:  1NT - (2@d) - 2NT/ 3@C (forced rebid ) - 3NT 
  you PROMISE a stopper in the overcall suit.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
  
That is a very brief intro to Lebensohl over NT.

tapanzee:  What if opener doesn't have a stopper?
mitche:  Then he bids his cheapest 4-card suit and you scramble.... remember, you have enough strength to stand
the 4-level.  
Scrambling is something bridge players do, just like eggs, and sometimes you get egg on your face when you
scramble.

OK, let's play some bridge! 

(MM: Please note that some may have the following agreement:
- all 3-level jumps will be GF (whether your suit is lower ranking than the overcall suit or not)
- this means, that there is no invitational bid for a LOWER ranking suit (only sign off or GF possible)
As always, check your partnership agreements)

at|mitche: Play: West knows that there are only about 10 points between North and East, and he can expect East to have at 
least a few of them.  I think it pays to lead aggressively against 1NT passed out, so the @SK looks right to me, even 
without the @SJ or 10.
Now East played the @S5 on the first spade (discouraging) and South ducked.
I think South must win the Ace at trick 1 and best is to return a spade at trick 2 to set up 2 spades in dummy.  
If West ducks, declarer can play on clubs to set up 2 spades, 3 clubs, and 2 hearts to assure the contract.|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt||

at|mitche:  As things developed, the defense played a second high spade (not best - look at the @SJ10 in dummy and you 
can see why).  Declarer won and played hearts to get to dummy and cash a couple of spades.

Better for declarer to duck a heart instead of using his entry too early.  As it turns out, the hearts are 3-3, so he can 
make the contract with just 1 club trick at that point.
And if the hearts don't split, he can take his best chance in clubs.|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Note that if declarer wins the first heart for the defense, he would have to guess whether to lead diamonds
or clubs, and the club return is much more attractive.
Butler39:  So leading a spade confused them?
mitche:  Well, the @SK was OK.  But when West sees the @sJ10 in dummy with just 1 entry there, I would shift to hearts to 
knock out the only sure way declarer has to get to them.  And that's also why declarer should win the first spade so he 
can return a spade and set up at least 1 extra spade. |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Now, in the endgame, when West led a @D at trick 10, East should win the Ace and return another @D (which would also be good enough to defeat the contract.

|sk||
at|mitche: Bidding:  I don't know if E/W had agreed on any conventions over 1NT, but West's hand is a good one for DONT 
2@D to show @D and a Major.
A 1-suited overcall should be on a good suit rather than points, something like @sxx, @hKQ109xx, @dQxx, @cKx. 
rather than scattered strength and a ragged 5-card suit.
Too often, you get killed when you bid a bad suit over 1NT.  I do not know if North intended 2NT as Lebensohl.
If he did, then South would have been obligated to bid 3@c.  
If 2NT wasn't Lebensohl, it should show a @h stopper and about 8-9 points.|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So I am confused by what 2NT was intended to show.  Lebensohl is a pretty easy convention here, so maybe 
we have a Lebensohl discussion later.  (MM: See "Extra" at beginning of this presentation)

It's important to know this one, because it saves a LOT of grief when the opps step in over a NT opener.
Anyway, declarer passed 2NT and that was the contract.

at|mitche:  Play:  The small @h was a standard-looking lead, and declarer could count a spade, 2 hearts, and 1 diamond, 
so she needed to set up clubs and properly led one at trick 2.

When West played the @CJ, declarer won (good idea ) and played a small club from dummy (not quite as good an idea ). 
If clubs are 3-1 with East holding the Qxx, then declarer must lose a club trick.
But if clubs are 2-2, she can win 5 clubs.  Since there is NO chance to avoid a loser when East has Qxx, declarer should 
just bang down the @CK instead of a small one.|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Let me put it this way: playing a second high club gives declarer a chance to win 5 clubs, but playing small 
assures a club loser.   And a small chance is better than no chance.

SK||

at|mitche: Bidding:  East has a pretty good hand, and 1@s was the right way to start to show it.  South has a pretty 
poor one, and pass was the way to show that. 
West has an interesting hand, with a spade void and about 9 points.  Bidding 1NT with a void in partner's suit is a 
recipe for getting into deep trouble. Your partner will expect a card or 2 in the suit, and if he rebids the suit at 
a higher level, then dummy would be a disappointment.
So unless you have a really good hand, the best way to avoid trouble is to pass and get out at a low level when you have 
a misfit.|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  If pard plays 1@s and goes down 1, not a tragedy, but down 2 at 2@S X might be.  
As it turns out, 1NT allowed East to bid 2@c to show a second suit.
South, whose hand was still pretty poor, bid a competitive 2@d. Note that 2@d HERE is a weak bid. 

North, I am sure, thought that it showed more strength than South had.  But here is the idea - if partner passes and 
then later supports your suit, it shows a weak hand.
mojila: I did count 4-5 cards and West 2 spades, so the double.|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  I understand, but North opened light in third seat, when South passes and bids a weak 2@d, there is a good chance 
that the hand belongs to E/W.
So while your idea that South was likely short in spades made sense, you cannot expect her to produce more than 1 
defensive trick and there is no assurance that your hand will produce 3 tricks.  So the double was very optimistic. 
BILAsst10: If West passes  that probably ends the bidding.
mitche:  If West passes 1@S, then that is likely to be the final contract, making or going down 1.|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  The difficulty here is that E/W haven't a method to show a 2-suited hand over 1@d.

Some pairs use "top and bottom" cue bids instead of Michaels, and some might bid 2NT, followed by 3@S if West 
bids 3@h. The problem there is when West bids 4@H, not 3. 
So unless you have a tool for handling these hands, you may occasionally get stuck in a silly contract.

at|mitche: Play:  East has a very difficult hand to lead from.  Leads from Q10 in this auction are very likely to cost a 
trick (and here, if declarer plays on spades, she gets 4 spade tricks).
With scattered strength, it is best (both in theory and practice) to make a safe lead, and here the safest lead is a club.
Putting it a different way: North has 18 and South at least 6 points.
East has 8, so that leaves a maximum of 8 points (and probably less) for West.|
pg| ***** 96 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Best is to hope to find them with your opening lead.  Also, if pard has spades, he might have bid 1@S over 1@h -- 
negative inference.
Even with 29 HCP, 3NT is no picnic for declarer, who has just 8 winners and needs to find a 9th trick.  
Best line, is to look for an extra trick in hearts, which is what declarer did.  
If hearts are 3-3 or if the heart honors are favorable, that is about an 85% chance to make without a finesse in @c or @d
So declarer's play of a heart finesse was correct.|

at|mitche: Bidding:  What should South do with 7 bad hearts and a bad hand over 2@c?
It depends on what N/S are playing.
A free bid here should show more strength.  So 2@H is not an option. 
Most pairs play 3@h jump as something other than weak.
West should have raised clubs over 3@C.  2@S was OK, but over 3@C, bid 4@C or even 5@c, but not 3@s.
Playing standard, South has no choice but to bid 3@h at her second turn, as she did.|

at|mitche:  But if you have a regular partnership, you need to discuss what jump shifts in competition mean.
Someone asked if this is a Weak Jump Overcall situation.  I think it should be, but I also think it is not standard.

The problem is that 1 plum, 2 grapes, Weak Jump Overcall could be interpreted as a "fit jump", and a lot of tournament 
players use it to show a good suit with support for opener's plums.
Example: 1@D (2@C) 3@h shows something like @sxxx, @hKQJxx, @dKQxx, @cx  
-- so that you can find a distributional game/slam.|

nt||
at|mitche:  Note that it's neither right nor wrong for South to bid 3@h at her first turn, just as long as she and 
her partner have an agreement.  Any agreement, even a poor one, is better than no agreement.

at|mitche:  Play:  4@h is cold, and double dummy, 4@s can be beaten (@DA, ruff, heart, diamond ruff), but North would have 
to have a real good peek to find that defense.
When South played at trick 1, she played the @H4 under the Ace, which I guess she hoped was to elicit a @D shift.  
But a low heart should mean "shift to the logical/obvious suit", and here that is @D.|
pg| ***** 114 ***** |


pf|y|nt||at|
Any @C tricks for the defense cannot run away, so a @D shift is called for.
If South ruffs on the hypothetical @DA play, ruff, etc., it promotes North's @s10 to the setting trick, by the way. |

at|mitche:  Bidding:  A "constructive" raise of 1@h or 1@s to 2 shows a 9 loser hand (see that Modern Losing Trick Count 
handout, folks).
How many losers are there in the North hand?  Yep, 10 of 'em.
So playing constructive raises, a pretty standard part of 2 over 1, the better sequence is 1@h - 1NT(forcing) / 2@D - 2@h.
South, with 4 1/2 losers (call it 5, since her hearts are nothing to write home about) will happily pass and N/S avoid 
the 3-level.  (Note that if the @HA were with East, even 2 hearts would have been trouble.)
The 4-1 trump split also made this a hard hand to manage.|
pg| ***** 119 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  The thing to notice about the discouraging 1NT - 2@h sequence is that while North has 8 points, she also has terrible shape.  
Make her hand 2344 and she would be justified in bidding 2@h directly.
For a game try opposite 1@h 2@h, declarer should have a 6 loser hand and a side suit that will generate an extra winner 
if partner can provide something useful either shortness or an honor.
South, with her 4 1/2 loser hand, may have made a help suit game try, even if North had bid 1NT and then 2@h, by rebidding 
3@d, saying  if you have a good fit for diamonds, bid game.|

The idea of HSGT is opener has a suit like K10xx and would like to know if responder has xxx (horrible) or Qx (good) 
cards in the suit.

at|mitche: Play:  West made an intelligent opening lead - any other lead risks blowing a trick (you could argue that a club 
is better, but since the opponents stopped in 3@h, pard is marked with points).

And as before, any spade cards pard has either work (sitting behind dummy's strength) or are winners outright (Ace or KQ) 
or could be picked off by declarer anyway.  For a club to work, pard would need strength in clubs.
And it is usually better to lead an unbid MAJOR than an unbid Minor.|

nt||
at|mitche:  So the OL was OK and declarer just played as best she could.  The 4-1 trump split made things uncomfortable, 
but she did well to hold herself to 4 red-suit losers.
