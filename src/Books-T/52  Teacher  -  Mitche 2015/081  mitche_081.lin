MM: The recommended screen resolution for .lin movies is 1440 x 900 pixels 
(rightclick on your desktop,select "personalize" "screen defenitions")
Also, make sure you have "widescreen" checked in your windows BBO-version
(If you're not sure about your settings log into your BBO windows version then:  
click the yellow tool at bottom and under the "general" tab check "widescreen" and save)
This will prevent the "cutting off" of the bottom parts or scrambling of your text in these presentations.

If you downloaded BBO recently, you will not be able to get online with the windows version...
You can still change or check your settings: 
Go to your C disc, and under "programs" find the Bridge Base Online folder
Open it and find the "profiles" folder
Open and scroll to find: BBO_Default_Settings 
line 71 should read: WIDE_CLIENT=1
If your setting is 0, change it to 1 and save.

fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department).  Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue 
(who loves puttering with the plants in the back yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.  Mitch is also an avid 
amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.  Mitch is currently an active bridge player, and joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team 
February 24, 2010.  His "Play and Discuss 2/1" sessions are most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player.

"When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."
Mitch Edelman aka "mitche" 


MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.
Thank you Eileen (wyoming33) for sending the hands and editing the chatlog! @h

at|mitche: Bidding:  West's 2@c bid is kind of an overbid.
Why?|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|
a) the hand is flat - 5332 is a balanced hand pattern, 
b) the club suit ain’t great, and 
c) the hand is not quite strong enough.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|
If you overcall 2 clubs over a 1 level bid, your suit needs to be at least QJ10xx (better is KQ10xx) or so,
and if not that strong, then longer.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So pass this hand in second seat.
2@h by North should show around 10 points.  This hand qualifies with 8 HCP (and a wasted jack) 
and extra length in hearts.  

The bid is 100% forcing in standard bidding, so you need at least that much for a free bid at the 2 level.
And so South bids 2NT (having no other real choice).|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  North should bid 3@h over 2NT. Why? |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


at|
a) South rates to have 2 hearts, and 
b) the hand is MUCH more valuable at hearts than NT.
South's high card strength will be useful at any contract, but North's hearts will be more useful at hearts.

at|mitche:  Play:  When East wins the @hKing, he should lead a club back, and not a @D.
If West has what she promised for her 2@c bid, this is the best chance to beat 2NT - 
Get the clubs going before West's entries are depleted.|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


at|
arya_01:  Was North strong enough to bid 3NT? 
mitche:  No. North should rebid 3@h. (2NT promises 12-14, a minimal opener)|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  If West finds an unlikely @D lead, I think 3NT may not make.... 
losing at least 2 hearts, a diamond, and a spade.  
Double dummy defense (not likely) will almost certainly beat 3NT.

MM: By clicking on the cards, you can play the hand Double Dummy.

If you aren’t familiar with the idea then you should learn it: |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


at|
An immediate cue bid is generally treated as showing a fit for OPENER's suit and about 10 or more points.
West decided her hand was not worth a game bid opposite 10 points and @HJxx.  
I would have bid 4@h here.   Why?|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  I have no wasted values in @D's and 6 losers.
A limit raise shows 8 losers,
And here I like my shape enough to risk the vulnerable game.

at|mitche: Play:  I have a problem with the opening lead:
Don’t lead an unsupported Ace in a side suit against a suit contract, especially when the opps have bid to a voluntary game.
Look at it this way: 
E/W have 24 or 25 HCP, probably, maybe more. North has 10 HCP. 
That leaves at most 6 HCP for South here.
So it is much more likely that E/W have the @SK than not.|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So leading the ace captures air.
Better to lead the @DK.
Set up a winner, and hope partner can contribute to the defense in some useful way.|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


at|
After the @SA, West must have believed that North started with a singleton.
So she decided to play a couple of rounds of trumps rather than a safety play in the suit.
But here in trumps that would not hurt.|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Why?|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


at|
West can see that South can't have a quick entry.
So by leading the @H10 (say it doesn’t get covered by south) and it loses to the @HJx in north.
A @D comes back, you win the Ace, and then lead another heart from dummy, playing the @hAK now.  
If hearts were 3-2, you are still OK.  
But if they're 4-1 you save a trick (unless you lose to a singleton Q or J).|

at|mitche: Bidding:  Should South pass 2@h?|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


at|
Let's remember that ANY bid South makes is forcing, except a heart raise.
So that means a 2@s bid is likely to get a 3@h bid.  Best for South to pass and take their lumps.
But when West doubles and East passes, the game has changed!
Now South KNOWS that hearts is going to be a poor place to play.   She should bid 2@s.|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  North might have a spade or 2, so 2@s rates to be no worse than hearts.

Next, when West returns a heart at trick 2, win the @HA and play 2 spades to discard a loser. 

North hopes to win 7 tricks with 4 trumps, 2 spades, and a club or diamond.. 
if she is really lucky she might even survive if hearts are 5-2.

|

at|mitche: Bidding:  Doubling 2@s with the West hand is a long-term losing strategy.
Why:|
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


at|  
1) flat hand, 
2) forcing pard to bid at the 3 level requires about 15 HCP or so.  More with less than ideal distribution.|
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Now we come to North's hand.
It has good support for spades (Honor doubleton) and good points after the X, so redouble.
Next:
Doubling 3@d is kind of risky.  North still has spade support and cannot count on more than 1 spade trick. 
Where are the rest of the tricks coming from? 2 diamonds? 2 clubs? |
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:   Maybe.. 
3@S is cold as the cards lay.
ecolodge:  I am confused, Mitch . . . thought the re-X meant I did not have @S support.
mitche:  Not here -- with no fit, North passes

at|mitche: Play:  After the Club lead, North shifted to the @SQ, and the defense got off to 3 quick winners.
North should overruff the @SJ at trick 4, play @CA and another club.
Then the defense legitimately comes to 7 tricks.
