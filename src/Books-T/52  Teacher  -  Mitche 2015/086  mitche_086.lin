fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."
Mitch Edelman aka "mitche" 


MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.
Thank you Eileen (wyoming33) for sending the hands and editing the chatlog! @h

pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|mitche:   Bidding:  South's third seat 1@h bid was enough to mess up E/W bidding.  
But even so, this hand is too weak for a third seat 1@h opener, because it hasn't got 1 1/2 quick tricks.  
If I weregoing to open that hand in third seat, I'd bid 2@h.
Reason: 
If the opponents get busy, then North will think South has some defense when he starts 1@h.  
West's hand is (almost) good enough to double and then bid spades.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  That sequence 1@h  (X)  and then bidding your own suit shows at least 17 HCP in standard bidding.
If you do double with the West hand and then bid spades, it says you have a 4 or 5 loser hand.  
West has a 5 loser hand, but the bidding suggests that the @DQ or @CK will be worth something, so I would probably take 
the more aggressive approach and double.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


at|
OK.. North has a bust hand with 4 card support for partner.  
I would not pass with that hand, but I would bid some number of hearts.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Depending on how pushy my partner's third seat openers are I bid 2 or 3 @h.  
If I am using Bergen's guidelines, I would bid 3@h -- let the opponents guess if they should bid past the 3 level.
Bergen says that after an overcall or double, a jump raise to 3@h or 3@s is weak, 0-6 points and 4-card support.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


at| 
BILAsst10: There is a problem with distribution though - not the best.
mitche:  Yes, North has the world's worst hand. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Even so, with 9 trumps between North and South, it is hard for E/W to arrange a penalty X.
My rule for penalty doubles I learned years ago: 
Penalty doubles without trump tricks are forbidden (especially low-level penalty X)|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


at|
In the actual auction, North passed, and now we turn to East's hand.
I treat the jump to 3@s here as being preemptive.
ecolodge:  I took it for a limit raise.  |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Problem is -- the standard way to show a limit raise is to cue bid, here 2@h.  
Anyway, West was going to bid game opposite any constructive bid by East.
Someone asked if East should cue bid. 
If your agreements allow it with 3 cards to a high honor, I would. 
If your agreements require 4-card support, then East has a tougher problem, but I'd still show the good hand 
because East has "prime" values (aces, king).
An expert pair might have other methods (like "mixed raise" or fit-showing jump-shift).

at|mitche:  Play:  Declarer decided to ruff a heart at trick 2.  I might have tried a finesse in clubs or
diamonds at trick 2 --(especially at matchpoints with dummy entries at a premium). 

Let's suppose that West finesses @d at trick 2, she can ruff out the small @d and make 12 tricks that way.  
South's opener pretty much guarantees the @DK is onside. |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: But in the actual play, she pulled trumps and then played the @cK and ducked a club, which lost to the Queen 
and then South returned a small @D
West took what Kantar calls a "practice" finesse, which means she makes the same number of tricks without taking the finesse.
At the time South returned a @D, dummy's clubs were all set up, and declarer could have discarded 2 @D's on them.  
So the finesse could only lose. 
There was no trick to be gained by taking it--hence a "practice" finesse.|

|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


sk||
at|mitche:  Bidding:  West's 2NT is "Jacoby 2NT."  
As West has a monster hand when East opens 1@s (13 HCP, + at least 1 for the quality @h suit + 3 more for the singleton) 
her hand is too strong to splinter to 4@d.  So good idea to bid J2NT.|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


at|
The alternative, bidding 2@h and then enthusiastically supporting spades, is how standard bidding worked back in 1958, 
when Aunt Millie and Cousin Clara played bridge.  So well-judged by West.|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  As it turns out, 6@s is a fair contract, as long as trumps behave. 
I think that West might bid 3@s instead of 4 because her hand is that good. 
If you can imagine a good play for slam opposite a minimum opening bid, then you should give partner a chance to cooperate.
Here over 3@s, East should bid 4@c, and that is just about all the encouragement West would need to look for slam.|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


at|
kat827:  How do I assess my hearts after hearing that East is short in hearts?  
I thought they would be wasted, but how should I think about them when they're so good (in this case).|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Well, a holding like KJ10x is wasted, Kat, but KQJxxx will produce at least 2 tricks. 
West's hand evaluates to more than 13 HCP - it is worth around 18 support points for spades.
veeree:  I was missing 3 honors in trump suit.
mitche:  Yes, you were but West has to have something for the 2NT bid.  Suppose West bids 3@s (showing extras) over 3@h -
then East should consider that she has first round control in 3 suits and a partner whose bid shows extras. |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  East could imagine slam even if West has just the @SKQxx and @CK. 
In fact, 6@S is about 75%, losing only when North has KQx or the spades split 4-0.|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


at|
kat827:  Would 4@C achieve the same thing as 3@S (by West), showing control in Clubs? I almost bid 4@C.
mitche:  4@c would be OK. My style is to bid 3@s because it gives partner the chance to sign off witha doggy hand or cue bid. |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: Again, an expert tool exists, called "serious 3NT" (google it:  ^*Hwww.bridgehands.com/S/Serious_3_Notrump.htm^*n|at|   
That allows you to invite cue bidding when you have a slammish hand.
I don't recommend Serious 3NT in casual partnerships and even with advanced players, 
you need a lot of discussion to agree on what the bid shows.
I mention it for those with established partnerships and the inclination to play tournament bridge.
It is NOT a tool for casual partnerships.

at|mitche:  Bidding:  West has a bit of a problem over 2@h.    I think 3@d is right.  
And over 3@d, East also has a bit of a problem - 3NT is a "momentum bid" 
- in other words, a bid that East is pretty much pushed into making after the 3@d call.

at|mitch:  Play:   Now, West has to have a genuine @D suit to bid it at the 3 level, 
so declarer is going to have to work on it to make the contract.    The bidding tells that to South.  
So with entries (2 outside aces), he knows that he's getting in.  The inference here - lead the unbid suit, clubs.|
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  At best you find partner with an honor, and if not, you don't help declarer by leading one of the suits 
he has to work on.
Declarer did well to guess to finesse the @h10 to make the contract.
As it happens, the contract is making because South has to give up a trick to dummy's @SJ eventually.
Even so, nicely played.

pg| ***** 74 ***** |


sk||

at|mitche:  Bidding:  North has a 6 loser hand, so even with 17 HCP, I prefer a 1@s overcall to doubling and then bidding
spades.  
East correctly passes 1@S, South correctly bids 2@s, which in the style we use, is WEAK 3 card support 
(at most a cruddy 6 points).
(MM: ?: Which "style" is this? Why a cruddy 6 pts at most? What would advancer do with 8 pts and 3-card? 
Say @dKQx and @hKx(x).. make a limit raise cue? )
mitche: Now I guess North fell in love with her 17 point hand and bid 3@d as a game try of sorts (still guessing).|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  South passed, which is rather a poor decision for 2 reasons: 
First, the partnership has already agreed on spades, so she should return to 3@s.
Second, spades scores higher.  And if both 3@d and 3@s are making, then 3@s pays off better.

But North should not really bid 3@d.
Why?
She has 6 losers, and for game to be on, South would need an 8 loser hand.|
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  If South has an 8 loser hand, she will make an invitational bid (like a cue bid of 2@h).
So South has a hand too weak to make a forward going bid, and North must realize that her sterile 5332
shape won't play as well as the point count suggests. 

It turns out that 3NT is a very lucky make (5 spades, @HA, 3@D's.  BUT that ain't the point! 
South wants to return to spades, and North wants to go quietly over 2@s, which is a WEAK bid.|
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  This is a very common problem for advancer (4th hand). 
A direct raise of overcaller's suit shows at most 7 points and may have as many as 10 losers!  
If you recognize that South has not got as few as 8 losers and North has a flat hand, then you get to the right conclusion.

calligal: Is it true that shape is more important than point count when you are at the 3 level?
mitche:  Shape is very important. |
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Mike Lawrence has a book out, titled "I fought the Law (of total tricks)" that goes into great detail about 
the value of shape.  And we all know Marty Bergen's "5-5 come alive, 6-4 bid more" mantra.  So yes, shape matters. 

Being able to set up your long suits requires that you have the "right" points.  
An old classic, Jeff Rubens "secrets of winning bridge" (I think that's the title) talks about knowing which points are 
the right ones.|
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


nt||
at|calligal: I still think I could not go to 3NT because of my lack of high card pts.
mitche:  Oh, 3NT is impossible to bid... don't even think about bidding it!!!

She should even be a bit stronger, especially at IMPS.

Some people use the so-called "rule of 2, 3, and 4."    Which says: 
with unfavorable vulnerability, the preempter should be within 2 tricks of making, with equal vul, within 3, 
and with favorable vul, within 4.|

at|mitche:  First (and especially second) seat, you should adhere to the rule of 2 and 3, 
being within 2 tricks of your contract when you are vul..   3 tricks in all other settings.

There are a lot of people who treat preempts as being destructive bids and bid on vapor.  
Marty loves to preempt on utter trash.  So if you take one of his lessons, you'll see some very light preemptive bids.
World champion Sabine Auken considers it unsporting to have as much as AQxxxxx when she preempts!|

at|mitche:  The fact is that you can get away with bidding on trash because the times you give up 
800 or 1100 are relatively infrequent, and the disruptive value pays for those occasional telephone numbers.|

West is sort of under the gun and has to find something to say.  I think 3@d is OK, but my style would be to double 
and hope my partner can find a 4-card heart suit, and even if he were to bid 3@s, that might not be too bad.|
pg| ***** 103 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: My fear with doubling 3@c is that East would bid 4@s with a 4-card suit and run into a bad split.  
If East passes for business, E-W will collect 500 as the cards lie.  
East with 2 trump tricks and a couple of outside tricks on his own will gladly sit for 3@C doubled at this vulnerability.
If anyone asks, I don't know how E-W can get to their ice-cold 6@d.

at|mitche:  Play:  West played the hand well, leading small trump from her hand 
(it is not likely that North has 3 diamonds in addition to her club length)  
Then setting up a discard for dummy's losing heart. Nicely done.

MM:  By clicking on the cards, you can play the hand Double Dummy, 
Please click the  ^$40 for the next board |

at|mitche:  Bidding:  For E-W - assume that 2NT is invitational, 2@S is minor suit Stayman. 

West decided to invite 3NT with her hand, and that seems right with 8 HCP and a 5 card suit.
East, with a hand closer to the top of his range than the bottom, accepted, also correct.

OK, let's summarize the important points from tonight: 
When you have found a fit, use the losing trick count as it's about as good a guide as I know of to help decide about inviting or accepting invitations to game.
Bid more aggressively with good distribution, more conservatively with flat hands.|
