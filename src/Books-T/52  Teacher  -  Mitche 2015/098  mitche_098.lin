fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|d|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back 
yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned SAYC, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."
Mitch Edelman aka "mitche"

MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.

at|mitche:  Bidding:  After West's 1@H bid,  East's choices are    a) XX, b) 2@H, c) 3@H, d) 4@H  
East should NEVER pass with this hand.  
A 2@C cue bid by East would show 10+ dummy  points.

I think that 4@h is right for 2 reasons: 
a) Law of total tricks bid, 
b) if we have a fit, so do they.  Make life tough on opps.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||

at|mitche:  And 4@h is wrong for 2 reasons: 
a) cruddy shape,  
b) a defensive card (@DK).  
An alternative bid is 3@c, a "mixed raise" showing 4 card support (usually) and 7-10 dummy points.

OK.. tick-tock 3@h or 4@h?|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Someone asked if 2NT might be better than 3@C.
2NT should be natural, stopper in black suits, @h doubleton or so, and just below an opening bid.
I am a believer in natural bidding when natural bids work well.

OK, so I am going to say 4@h (over 3@h, South has an easy 3@s). But what should he do over 4@h?
Mike Lawrence says, "when faced with a number of bids, and 4@S is alternative, bid 4@s."|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  OK, let's ask how many trumps we have:  8 trump. 
And they have 10 or 11 trumps
So there are 18 or 19 total trumps.
Which means that if they can make 4@h we are down 1 (or 2) at 4@s.
And if we can take 10 tricks, they should be down 1 at 4@h -- Just applying total tricks thinking.
So 4@s X is -300, but then 4@h makes for +420.  And if 4@s makes, we should beat 4@h 300 (doubled).|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Either that or both sides take 9 tricks.
The decision is pretty straightforward.  We need to bid 4@s and take the phantom save.

What should West do over 4@s?
jonnyquest:  Smile?
WestElsdon:  pass

at|mitche:  Play:  What should West lead?
Heart lead lets 4@s make. 
Remember the rule not to lead unsupported ace against suit contract?
jonnyquest:  There may be two trump tricks, so can't lead a @S. Unsupported Aces are painful and someone may be short.  
mitche:  @DA is unsupported too.  So a passive @C?
If leading an unsupported Ace is an error, under leading one at trick 1 is a crime!|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Now South thinks someone may have a singleton, and counts 2 or 3 diamond  and 1 or 2 trump losers.
So best hope is to find @SJ and also the @DJ.  Too bad.
Now, the defense has to play very safe.  West doesn’t know if the @cJ is an entry.The only shot to defeat the 
contract now is to under lead the @DA at trick 5.
But I don’t think it's possible to find that at the table.
DECLARER concedes a trick to the @sA.|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  The thing to see here is the thinking that would make E/W decide not to save against 4@s.
West has 3 or 4 pretty sure tricks on defense, but the LOTT tells him not to bid 5@h.
4@h loses a spade, a heart, and 2 clubs.

"Supported Ace" specifically means "with the King" or "proof that pard has the K."
And proof may be in the form of a "Romex double" or some other bid that shows a high honor.|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  a “Romex” double works like this: 
You are advancer, partner overcalls opener’s suit. Example:  1@H on your left, 2@C by pard, 2@H on your right. 
You have @cKx  (one of top 2 honors).   Your double to say, “I have the A or K of your suit”. 
This allows overcaller to lead from a suit with an unsupported Ace or to put you in for a shift thru declarer’s hand.
You give up the ability to make a double of a suit bid by RHO.  
Also, Romex Redouble is possible:    1@H - 2@C - X - XX |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |

By the way, against SLAMS, leading an unsupported ace may be the best lead.

at|mitche: Bidding: If you play "constructive" raises of 1@H or 1@S, then West has to decide if he should bid 1NT or 2@s.
Here is the guideline. How many losers does he have?
Looks like 9 to me.
So with 9 losers, he should bid 2@s.
Now, East has how many losers?   Six of them.
9+6 = 15, which means she expects to take 24-15 = 9 tricks.
That means that 4 spades is a bad idea.|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:   BUT west found 3@s so East may decide that 4 is a good bid.
Should West bid 3@s?
I think not.  Why?
A) his hand had 9 losers and no extras,  
B) he already said he has 9 losers. 
My friend, Maryann Dufresne used to say, "don’t tell the same story twice."
The 3@s bid told more than the same story twice.|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Now, should North bid 2NT?
I don’t know if most pairs treat 2NT as unusual here, but let's assume they treat it that way, so 2NT means bid a minor.
South obediently does.  Now North should not pass over 3@S.  She has a 3 loser hand and should bid 4@d,
Vulnerable that shows a whale of a hand, and if fact, 5@d is on ice.

South would bid 3@d with xxx, xxxx, KJx, xxx and 5@D is still cold.
As long as South has 3 diamonds, 4@d is a probable make.|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Point here is that when you use a 2-suited overcall, I recommend this treatment:
If the hand is weak (less than a minimum opener) then the hand passes at its next opportunity. 
If the hand is more than a king bigger than a minimum opening bid (16+ points), then a single raise shows that.
Here, 4@d shows the big hand.
If the hand is in between, then do not use Unusual2NT (or Michaels) but bid your 2 suits .
North bids 3@d and then 4@c (treating the hand as a 2-suiter) 
or Double, followed by correcting hearts by pard to clubs... to show the big, big hand.|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  The thing North knows is that South is broke.
And she has to decide how best to proceed.  I think if 2NT is on your card, bid it and raise.

Note also that a double jump (e.g. to 5@d over 3@s) is a sacrifice bid showing a freakish hand.
Mitche: The single raise also shows defensive values.

at|mitche: Play: I think with South hand, I might lead the @C5 instead of a @D because I hope to use that suit to put pard
in for a ruff.
Imagine that declarer wins the @CA and takes a @S finesse to South's king,  then a @D lead might get that ruff in.
The idea: singleton leads work well, especially if you think you might win an early trump lead.

at|mitche: Bidding: With the West hand, I might try a 2@h Michaels cue-bid here, rather than 1@s. 
West has 2 decent 5-card suits and not quite a full opener. 
(It's a bergen 20, so maybe I would overcall, but the problem is I may not be able to get clubs in below the 4-level).
Now: what should North do over 1@s?
We agree that  3@h is weak-- right?
Here, North has too much good stuff for a 3@h bid, and 2@h is junk.|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  My preference here is to use Bergen raises over 1-level overcalls but that is very not standard.
Also not standard is to use BROMAD over 1@S overcalls.
Bidding standard, my preference is to lie with 3@h (after all the hand has 9 losers) rather than lie with 2@h.
Reason - I'd bid 3@h without the @SJ.
It is not an easy hand for North.
But over 3@h, South should pass.

at|mitch:  Play:   What card did East play under the @CA opening lead? 
I think it should be an encouraging card, not the @c2.
Reason: East has no reason to suspect club length with West, and with the @CQ, East should expect the defense to be 
able to cash 2 clubs, and 2 Aces.
In fact, East defended that way, by playing a CLUB, not a Diamond when she won her @DA.|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So West should either continue with the @CK at trick 2 or lead the @D10 at trick 1.
When West does NOT lead the @D10 at trick 1, there is a strong inference that it is not a singleton.
South received a (temporary) reprieve at trick 3 and took advantage of it.. leading a spade to the Jack (West bid spades).
And a heart to hand is OK as long as East has the @HA
When the @HK scores, he should play another trump immediately, hoping for 2-2 split.
But the fact is that the diamond to the King was the correct play.|
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  West did not lead his singleton at trick 1, so the inference that it was not singleton is so strong, the @DK 
should be a  winner.  In other words, Declarer played the hand correctly.

at|mitche:  Play:  Play was pretty straightforward.
South saw the @HQ at trick 1 (and parner's discouraging signal, good!) and decided to shift to a club, also a good idea. 
So that's that on this hand.

MM:  By clicking on the cards, you can play the hand Double Dummy,

at|mitche: Bidding: Not sure that I open East hand.   
It doesn’t have 2 quick tricks.. and the singleton King is not 3 points either.|

A couple of points on splinters:
They should be limited to 13-15 dummy points, so Jacoby 2NT might be a better idea than 4@c here.
West has a hand worth about 16 dummy points as I count things so I start 2NT.|

at|mitche:  East's 1@h opening might not be the choice of several players:  
a) There are not 2 quick tricks (single king is not 1/2 defense trick .. sorry),  
b) @H suit is pretty thin.

Yes, it's almost a Bergen 20 but the poor suit quality might make this a hand to soft-pedal.
OTOH, modern style is to open these kinds of hands because it pays to get the first blow in. 
In other words it is a matter of style whether to open this hand.  |

nt||
at|mitche:  My style playing standard is not to ... 
but I don't object very strenuously to those who do open 1@h.
After the splinter, East has to do some quick reassessing.  
The club Ace opposite shortness is a good thing, but the @CQ is wasted.  
And there may be some argument that responder's strength and club weakness make it more likely that the @SK is worth something.  But I do not like my hand all that much, and might very well just bid 4@h here, and if West has 
the magic hand I pay off.|

at|mitche:  But West needs at least 3 key cards for slam to be a good idea.
My rule of thumb for Blackwood is that the BW bidder needs at least 1 key card  AND the trump Queen to inquire
If you don’t have the trump Q you need 2 key cards for Blackwood.
So over West's 4@h I pass.
Remember that - it'll keep you out of a lot of bad slams.   
The Blackwood bidder promises at least 1 key card and the trump Q or 2 key cards.
I think the double of 6@h is the kind of bid that often backfires.  What happens if East is void in spades?|

nt||
at|mitche: A double of a voluntarily bid slam should always be Lightener X  (asking for unusual lead), 
usually dummy's first bid suit.
WestElsdon:  West's splinter said he had a void in Clubs, logical that he did not have 2 voids.
mitche:  West's splinter says singleton or void, Tom.
East might be bidding on a giraffe (which he is).

at|mitche: Play:  After the spade lives, North should play the @DK.    Why?
The trump Ace is very likely to be a winner :)  so North should try to set up a trick with the @DKQ.
East did well to escape for down 1. 
A better line might be to play for a complete cross ruff.  As the only trump left outstanding is the 4, 
no over ruffs will occur and declarer has 3 outside winners and 9 trumps after losing his 2 Aces.

MM: You can play the hand Double Dummy if you wish
This concludes this presentation, hope you enjoyed, Karen10 & GG_Bridge
