fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp|1|cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back 
yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||fp|1|cp|2|at|^b@2

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.
We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned SAYC, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

fp|1|cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|
at|^b@2

When your left-hand opponent opens the bidding and your partner doubles, it shows support (at least Hxx) for any 
unbid Major, shortness in the suit that she doubled, and an opening hand (or very very close to it).
So, let's see: LHO and partner have opening bids, leaving perhaps 14 points total for you and RHO.. 
If your RHO passes, then you have 2 choices: to bid or to pass. 

Let us see what you need to ^*upass^*n partner's double: 
You need to have a lot of trump tricks, AND no fit for partner's Major.

Example: LHO opened 1@h, your pard doubled, and RHO passes: 1@h  X   pass   ??
You have @sx   @HKQ1098   @dAxx   @cJxxx 
This is a MINIMUM hand for passing the double of 1 of a Major, converting partner's Take-out X into a penalty.
Notice... you do not have a Major-suit fit... 

BabsG:  Does this have anything to do with the Rule of  9?
mitche: No.. it has to do with Ron Klinger's rule of 10 and 12  
We will be discussing that shortly and you can find it online at bridgehands.com.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|

Basically the rule of 10 and 12 is: 
- the length of your trump suit plus the level of the contract must be at least 12 (rule of 12)
- And the number of trump winners in your hand + level is at least 10.

So here: You have a misfit and the balance of power: 
- you have 3 sure trump-winners (KQ109) and the opponents are contracting for 7 tricks  => meets rule of 10)
- you have 5 trumps + 7 trick contract level = 12 => meets the rule of 12.
|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||ht|c|cp|2|fp|1|
at|^b@2

Clearly, the higher the level, the fewer trumps and tricks you need to pass a take-out X.  

Most of the time you will want to bid over partner's TO double
So here is the general idea: bid your longest suit other than the one bid by LHO
Example: 1@h  X  pass  ??   
You have @sxxxx  @hxxx  @dJxx  @cQxx 
You MUST bid, so you bid 1@s, your longest suit.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|

If I have a 4-card Major and a 5-card minor, it depends on scoring method, to an extent.
At anything but matchpoints, bid your longest suit (generally), but prefer your 4-card Major at MP's
or if your Major has better "texture"
Remember, your pard will probably lead your suit if the other side wins the contract.. 
Do not hang him by bidding 2@C when you have @sKJxx,@hxxx,@Dx,@cJxxxx
As usual, we love to bid Majors and bid minors only when we have a very good reason to do so.

Sometimes, you have a better hand than the junky 1@S hand we just saw
^*uWhen you have 9+ points, jump 1 level^*n 
Example: Again, the bidding was 1@h  X  pass   ??
You have @sKJxx   @hxxx   @dxx   @cAJxx.        Jump to 2@s with this hand.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|

The arithmetic behind the 9 HCP thing is - when you have 9 + HCP, your side owns the hand .. 
so you announce it to pard, and you may wind up getting to game, even when LHO opened.


1@d - X - pass - 2@d = partner, pick a Major.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||ht|b|cp|2|fp|1|
at|^b@2

Ok .. We have discussed the main kinds of hands and bids you will see when your RHO passes the double.
Some times, RHO will find some kind of bid: a raise of 1@h to 2@h or maybe he bids a new suit or some number of NT
So what do you do when the auction goes     1plum  X  2plums   ??

There is not much of a chance for you to have enough trumps to double for penalty, so the double is "^*uresponsive^*n".
It shows a hand with support for the unbid suits, and depending on the level you are forcing partner to bid at, 
your point count is as follows: 
- If pard can bid at the 2-level, your hand should have a good 6-8 or so, 
- If you are forcing pard to bid at the 3 level, you should have a very good 8 or 9 hcp.
Example:  @sQxxx   @hAxxx   @dxx   @cQJx  
LHO bids   1@d   X   2@d  ?? -- You would double again.
So a responsive double shows support for any suit the doubler would like to bid.
If the auction were   1@s   X    2@s --   you would need a hand like this to double responsively:  
@sxx   @hAxxx   @dKJx   @cQJxx|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|

Finally, what does it mean if the partner of the opener (responder) bids some new suit?   Example:  1@c  X  1@S  ??
Now, your double (in Standard bidding) is not responsive. ^*uIt is a penalty double^*n! 
You are showing 4+ spades AND about 9 points.
Here is the logic: 
pard has 13 points (about) and for his double of 1@C, at least 3 spades....right?  You have 4-card "support" for spades
and with 8 or 9 points, you have the balance of strength, too.  So you have the majority of the spades and the majority 
of the points. 
Think the opponents are going to like being in spades?|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


at|

This also helps you expose the jokester who bids his short suit when he has a big fit for his partner's minor
OK, that is it for this part of the rather complicated topic of bidding after your partner doubles.. 
For a complete discussion of this, there are 3 books I like: 
a) "bridge with bells and whistles, by MaryAnn Dufresne (book of the year, 2010), 
b) Ellen Pomer's book SAYC, which is more for beginners, and finally, 
c) Eddie Kantar's beginner's bidding book..|cp|4|at|IMPROVE YOUR BIDDING SKILLS |

moviemaker: And as a reminder:

A general guideline for Responder when your partner's opening bid is doubled by RHO:

1@d   X   XX = 10+ (balanced with lack of support, forcing)
1@d   X   1NT = 8-10 (and don't do it if you don't want to play in NT)
1@d   X   2NT = 11-12
1@d   X   1y = 4+card, forcing (only if you don't mind to be raised)
1@d   X   2@c (2 over 1: strong 5-card, less than 10 pts, NF)
1@d   X   2@h (jump shift: 6-card, no outside defense, 4-6 pts to the Ace)

(1@d  X  2NT "Flip-Flop" = pre-empt
1@d   X  3@d = limit raise         => Partner can still play the 3NT)

1@h/@s   X   2NT = Jordan, limit raise or better, 4+ support (some play 3+)

fp|1|cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|
at|^b@2

Here is the basic situation: You are in third seat, your partner opened 1@h or 1@s, 
and RHO does something other than pass.
Let's start with the simplest thing: your pard opens 1@h (say), and RHO doubles:  1@h - X - ??.

You have some support, say 3 cards, and some points -- Let's say between 6 and 9.
You would raise 1@h to 2@h with such a hand without the double, right? 
example: @sxx, @hQxx, @dKJxx, @cJxxx
Just raise to 2@h.
A ^*usingle raise^*n of 1@H or 1@S to 2M is exactly the same kind of hand you would raise wihtout the double.
That is the easy stuff.

Now, let's suppose you have a 4-card support.
If your hand is really weak (0 to 6 points), ^*uraise to 3^*n!!
I also insist on some shape (preferably a singleton somewhere), but I will do this with a doubleton in the other major, too.
Example:  1@h   (X)  and you have  @sxxx   @hQxxx   @dx   @cxxxxx 
Bid 3@h. Just do it!

Will you get doubled?  Maybe, but the defenders need trump tricks to be comfortable in doubling.
And if they can beat you a lot of tricks, they probably can make game on their own.|

nt||fp|1|ht|c|cs|2|cp|2|
AT|^b@2

Let's consider the case where you have 4-card support and 9+ HCP, (10+ dummy points: limit raise(+) values)
You should bid ^*u2NT^*n, the "Jordan convention". 
So   1@h  (X)  2NT   means  - "limit raise or better with a 4-card support".

What's really nice about this bid is opener immediately knows the most important 2 facts about your hand --
point count and 4-card support.
 
There are 2 schools of thought on what to do with 7-9 points and 4 card support. 

Bergen uses ^*b"BROMAD"^*n - Bergen Raises of Major After Double. 
Here is how it works. 

1@h  (X)   ??
- With 7-9 points and 3-card support, bid ^*u2@C^*n 
- With 7-9 points and 4-card support, bid ^*u2@d^*n

Example:    @sxx   @hKxxx   @dQJxx   @cQxx
Bid 2@d over  1@h (X) 
This is 100% non-standard and requires you and partner to discuss carefully.
With    @sxx   @hKxx   @dQJxx   @cQxxx --  bid 2@c.

Note that if you use this convention, you raise 1@h to 2@h with 3 trump and junk.|

nt||fp|1|ht|c|cs|2|cp|2|
AT|^b@2

Wayne_LV:  I fail to see the big deal about 3-card support or 4-card support for a major, if you bid point
count what diff does it make?     Seems like a ton of extra baggage to carry for a small distinction.

mitche: The difference is that a 9-card fit is vastly better than an 8-card fit.  You are "law protected" with a 9-card 
fit to bid to the 3 level... Bergen says that the 9th trump is the most underrated card in the deck!

Wayne_LV:  I realize that but when does it make a diff between bidding game and not bidding game if you have the points?

mitche: When someone doubles, announcing an opening hand and shortness in your bid suit, you can expect a bad trump split, 
Wayne, so that 5-4 fit is crucial in deciding whether to bid to  the 3 or 4 level.
In my experience, bidding to game on an 8 card fit after a double requires something extra.. 

If  I am using BROMAD, I will raise 1@h to 2@h with any 3-card support and any 4-6 point hand.
With 0-3 points, I am not eager to punish pard.  But that 4-card raise to 3 is really, really effective. 
It's almost as disruptive as an opening 3 bid.|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


at|

So we have covered 3 and 4 card raises.
What if you do not have a raise?
What if you do not have a fit and you do have a lot for points (say 10 or more)?
You ^*uREDOUBLE^*n
This says, "good hand, but no 4-card support.."
It is something you can find on the convention card under the box "redouble implies no fit" and is not alertable
You might have 3-card support, in which case you will raise later. 
But the redouble says, "we own the hand" and we expect to be able to punish the opponents if they get too frisky.

In principle, yes, it means no support. 
But what do you do with   @sxx   @hKxx   @dAxxx   @cAJ10x ?|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||fp|1|ht|c|cs|2|cp|2|
AT|^b@2

Again, the point I wish to reinforce is to show support immediately when you have 4-card support.

If you have a weak hand with 5-card support and a singleton,
you may ^*upreemptively raise to 4^*n of your pard's Major. 

The last point  I want to make: if you bid a new suit at the 1 level, it is forcing. 
Example:  @sQ10xxx   @hx   @dAxx   @cQJxx  
Bids 1@S when RHO doubles 1@h by your pard
Almost good enough to redouble.

BTW, this is much more frequent when opener starts with 1@c or 1@D.  
And bidding a new suit at the 2 level is non-forcing. 
For instance, over   1@H  (X)
Bid 2@c with @sxx, @hxx, @dQxx, @cKJ10xxx

I think that bidding 2@c here also should show tolerance for your pard's opening 1@H (or 1@S) ... 
So your pard might feel a bit less timid about bidding 2@h with a strong 5-card suit. 
Once again, make sure you and your pard have discussed.

Summary: If you play BROMAD: 
- Raise 1@h or 1@s to 2 with 3 card support and < 6 HCP
- With <6 HCP and 4 card spport, bid 3
- With 7-9 HCP and 3 card support, bid 2@C (BROMAD and ALERTABLE). 
- With 10+ points and  less than 4 card support, redouble (and raise P later with a 3-card support)
- With a limit raise+ and a 4-card support, use JORDAN 2NT
- With 4-card support and 7-9 points, bid 2@D (BROMAD and ALERTABLE)
- Finally with more trumps, (5+) consider a jump raise to 4 (preemptively)

fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Klinger's Rules of 10 and 12 }|
fp|1|cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|
at|^b@2
I'll go over Klinger's rule of 12 and 10, which helps you decide whether to pass your partner's  takeout double.

Here is the problem:
Your pard made a takeout double and you need to decide whether to bid or pass.
What are the general conditions where you would even think of passing?
There are 2 of them: 
- First, and most important - you need to have a trump stack. How much of a stack, we will discover.
- Second - we must NOT have a fit with partner.

If pard doubles a 1-level bid, she has either a very good hand with an independent suit or a hand short in opener's bid 
suit, and almost always, 4-card support in at least one Major.

So let's suppose you have   @sQ10xx   @hx   @dKQJxx   @cAxx    and your LHO opened 1@d and pard doubles.
You know (or should strongly suspect) that your side has a spade fit.
So that means - bid to show your fit and don't even think about passing 1@D.

There are 2 rules for deciding whether to pass the takeout double -- what Ron Klinger calls the rules of 10 and 12. 
The Rule of 10 says: 
ADD the number of trump tricks you expect to win to the number of tricks the opponents are trying to win;
If that number is AT LEAST 10, you should consider passing the double. 
Example: you are planning to defend at the 1 level. The opponents are trying for 7 tricks. 10 - 7 = 3. 
You need at least 3 trump winners to consider passing.
So the higher the contract, the fewer sure trumps you need - at the 3 level, 10 - 9 = 1. 
You must have at least one sure trump trick to consider passing.|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt||ht|c|fp|1|cp|2|
at|^b@2

Example: you hold    @sx   @hQxx   @dAJxxx   @cKxxx
Your pard opens 1@S and your RHO overcalls 2@c... you pass, LHO passes, and pard reopens with a double.
Using just the rule of 10, do you pass?
You have 1 trump trick. 10 -8 = 2, so you do not have enough stuff in trumps to pass.

But suppose that RHO had overcalled 2@d. 
Now, you have 2 trump tricks for sure, 10 -8 = 2 
So your trump holding IS strong enough for a penalty pass.

EddyHaskel: So you don't count shortness in pard's suit as a likely ruff and count two "likely" club tricks?
mitche: Nope. I expect declarer will try to pull trumps as soon as he can. I need very probable trump winners. 
And we still have the rule of 12 to go over.

The rule of 12 deals with trump LENGTH.
When you are considering passing a takeout X and converting it to penalty, add the number of cards you hold in their 
trump suit to the number of tricks they are trying for. 
If the number is at least 12, then you have enough trumps to pass.
If the contract is at the 1-level, 12 -7 = 5. You should have at least a 5 card trump suit to consider passing
At the 2-level, 4 trumps, and at the 3 level. 12 - 9 = 3 trump cards. 
That plus the rule of 10... 

Note that we are discussing JUST trump holdings for considering passing... 
Let's go back to the example hand:  @sx   @hQ10x   @dAJxxx   @cKxxx  - if RHO overcalls 1@S with 2@c
We have 4 trumps, 12-8 = 4, so we are OK on the rule of 12, but the rule of 10 says, 10-8 = 2 sure trumps. 
We still may beat 2@c a trick, but if we passed, we should not be surprised to give up  -180|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt||ht|c|fp|1|cp|2|
at|^b@2
OTOH, we have 5 trump cards in diamonds, and we have 10 - 8 = 2 sure trump winners. 
We should be able to beat 2@d enough to compensate us for any positive score we would be entitled to by declaring. 
And note, we don't have a fit for either Major...

So that leaves just one other question - if you have the misfit and meet the requirements for both the rule of 10 and 12, 
should you pass a takeout X?
My rule of thumb is: 
Assuming pard's takeout X shows full values (sound opening bids), that's enough. 
If you open light, I would like 1/2 quick trick (an outside K or more) to pass  at the 1 or 2 level.
So the sample hand (@sx,@hQ10x,@DAJxxx,@cKxxx) has both the rule of 10 and 12 met, plus 2 outside cards. 
This means that even if pard opened light, I would expect to have enough to beat 2@D.
Putting it another way - we reasonably can expect to have the balance of strength (10 + pard's 11 or 12 HCP minimum) 
to be reasonably confident of a set of 2@d, but not 2@c or 2@h

EddyHaskel:  Do these apply only to pard's direct seat takeout doubles?  Not balancing seat doubles, I assume?
mitche:  These can be used over takeout doubles or when you might be making a penalty X of your own. 
If pard is doubling in the balancing seat, add 1 full Quick Trick to the strength requirement - 
pard's balancing X has already bid about 4 of your points for you
That plus the rules of 10, 12 requirements..

fp|1|cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|
at|^b@2(MM: Some repetition, some new points)
When your partner opens (especially 1 of a Major) and your RHO doubles, it's important to show a fit when you have one.
So if I have a 3-or 4-card fit I will show it. 
An immediate raise says "3 cards and a weakish hand" 
e.g. after 1@S, if I have @sQxx,@hxxx,@DKxxx,@cxxx I raise to 2@s.

How many of you play or know Bergen raises?

So if you play Bergen, this is important: 
After a double of 1@H or 1@S, BERGEN RAISES ARE OFF!!!
Marty invented a convention that he calls "BROMAD" - Bergen Raises Of Major After Double
Here is the idea:

With a "constructive" raise, i.e. 7-9 dummy points, and a double of 1@H or 1@S, 
you use 2@C to show 3 card support and 7-9 dummy points,
And 2@D shows 4 card support and 7-9 dummy points.

Example: @sJxxx,@hKxx,@DKJxx,@cxx
If partner opens 1@H and your RHO doubles, playing BROMAD, you bid 2@C.
If partner opened 1@S, and double on your right, you bid 2@D.

That leaves 1 other case where you want to raise: 
10+ dummy points and a fit  (well, it also leaves the really weak 4 and 5 card raises, and I'll get to them, too) :).
If you happen to have a hand like this: K10xx, xx, Axx, QJxx -- you are too strong for a BROMAD 2@D over 1@S X right? 
So what do you do?|

at|^b@2
Conventionally, the auction 1@S/1@H - (X) - 2NT says, "I have at least a limit raise of your Major"
Because space may be limited, I think that 3-card support is also acceptable for the Jordan 2NT

BILAsst10: not everyone agrees - not saying right or wrong.
mitche: Eileen's point is well-taken. I use 2NT to show 3-card support with ruffing value.
Otherwise, the redouble gets overloaded.  We'll get to that in a moment.

Almost everyone uses the raise to 3 of a Major after X to show 4-card support and 0-6 HCP 
(and a singleton is highly recommended for that jump, too)
So  1@S  (X)  3@S    shows something like @sJ10xx,@hxx,@Dxxxxx,@cQx or thereabouts. 
It is a really trashy hand with support
And  1@S  (X)  4@S    shows something like this: @sQxxxx,@hx,@DJxx,@cQxxx  or so.
It is important that you have some distribution for the jump to 4@S here. 
Depending on vulnerability and suit quality, you may decide to play it safe by bidding just 3@S 
on a hand with 5-3-2-2- shape.

So yes, I would say the jump to 4 almost always shows a singleton, or maybe 5422 with a halfway decent 4-card suit, 
e.g. @sQxxxx,@hxx,@DK10xx,@cxx.
But do not be surprised if your leap gets you -500... |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt||ht|b|cp|2|fp|1|
at|^b@2
One other thing to mention. 
If your pard opens 1@C or 1@D and you have a 7 point hand, you should find some action.
Example: pard opens 1@D and RHO doubles - with @sQJxxx,@hxx,@DJxx,@cKxx, I bid 1@S.
You do not promise a 5-card Major, but you do suggest a suit that partner can safely lead from 
(assuming that her holding is not an unsupported Ace, of course!).

And that leaves just one more case: you have a good hand with no good fit for partner
Example:  @sxx,@hAxx,@DKJxx,@cQ10xx
Over  1@S  (X)   your action is to redouble!
Your XX says, "We have the balance of strength" and it suggests very strongly that you are interested in a penalty double
 of anything they bid.. 

If you have a good enough hand to redouble, and your LHO passes your partner will pass with a semi-balanced hand 
and wait for the doubler to rescue himself.  Then you get your penalty X in, most likely.
If opener is unbalanced, he will bid a second suit.

Example: opener has 5-2-3-3 and it goes 1@S  X  XX  pass.
He passes too, and waits for LHO to move.
If doubler passes, you expect to make on brute force.
If doubler guesses to bid partner's 4-card suit, partner should double.
If not, he will pass or bid NT... 

Example: your hand was 5-2-3-3 and doubler reopens with 2@H.
If pard doubles 2@H, it is business. 
If he passes, you are expected to do something clever - 
either double or bid a second suit or NT, if you have hearts stopped.

I am known at the club for finding the worst possible auction in competition.
The way I learned declarer play was by winding up in horrible contracts :)
You know, like missing my 5-4 fit to play in a 3-2 fit ---|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt||ht|c|cp|2|fp|1|
at|^b@2OK, getting back to the discussion .. 

It takes some experience to judge when to double or when to push to your own contract
General rule of thumb: 
At IMPS, be willing to push to game UNLESS you can see a probable 2 trick set of a part score.

I don't like trap passing.. 
Sometimes it works very well, but more often, you trap partner. 
btour:  well with 8-12 you get to hear from doubler's pard.
mitche: Bob, here is what happens when you pass.
The opponents get to find their fit, and when you back in, they get a "fielder's choice" whether to bid on, take a 
save, pass, or hammer you.


^*bMM: This concludes Mitch's notes
The hands that follow are a selection of hands played during Mitch's sessions in the BIL
All are more or less related to the subject.
But please do not forget that after each hand is played, Mitch gives VERY valuable insights on the PLAY of the hand as well!
Quiz questions are during bidding and/or play
To get the most out of these movies work through each hand from start to finish 
Hope you enjoy our new format and that it proves more useful to you!^*n

at|mitche:  Bidding:  Even at this vulnerability (maybe especially at this vulnerability), South should double 1@C and look
to compete.  Occasionally doubling will get you in hot water (e.g. North has 4 spades and gets carried away) but most of
the time, you will do better to double with South's hand than to pass.  West has a decision to make.  With this hand, pass
is probably right.
How do you respond to a takeout X?
Well, partner has forced you to bid (in 4th seat here), so your bid might be on 0 HCP.   Ever since the days of Charles Goren,
a non-jump bid shows 0-8 points.  A simple jump shows, by general agreement, 9-12 points. |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  With more, you cue bid the suit that your pard doubled (clubs, here).  North can discount the value of his 
@CQ, but that still leaves him with a very healthy 9 HCP and a good 5 card suit.  So 2@h is close to being an underbid. 
But it's the right bid here.

One last point: if advancer (WestElsdon here) bids 1NT, he shows 6-9 HCP AND a club stopper.  A jump to 2NT shows 10-12 
and should be made only with double stopper in clubs.  A NT bid also denies a 4-card or longer Major.
azin: Should North consider the LAW and bid 3@H?|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  I think 2@h is enough because it is possible that South doubled on just a 3-card heart suit -- swap Sue's spades
and hearts.  If North does bid 2@h, then East should still bid 2@S, I think.
But here 1@S was correct, and now, in competition, South's bid of 2@h is a bit optimistic (after all, 1@h might be on 4 bad 
hearts and 2 points.  After 2@h, West should bid 2@S, not 3@c.  The name of the game is Major fits--tell your pard the good 
news, you have 4-card support.  West limited her hand with the pass, so East won't get real excited by 2@s.
Now, 3@h shows about 8 HCP because North did not bid 2@h at his first turn, thus it is not possible for them to bid to game. 
Just as well since 4@h needs a lucky opening lead or a slip in defense to make.

at|mitche:  Play:  Part of being a successful declarer is being sneaky. It's the art of declarer play rather than technique.
ecolodge:  Better lead by East?
mitche:  East has reason to suspect a club honor in West hand.  A singleton trump is not often a good idea, and leading from 
@DA or @SAQ is very bad, so club is really called for here - Unlucky!!
|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  One other point. Declarer should try the @DJ from dummy when he breaks the suit and "finesse" it.
Declarer knows that his @D suit is stacked, but defenders do not. 
And it is a good idea to develop the habit of concealing  strength. Lead/play what they "know" you have when possible.

pg| ***** 49 ***** |


at|mitche:  Bidding:  If you wait for the perfect hand to preempt, you might wait a long time.  I think the ideal hand for a 
3-level preempt is:  
a)7321 or 7330 shape (7222 is the worst); 
b) having a decent suit, usually QJ10xxxx or better (i.e. 3 of top 5); and 
c) not having a lot of stuff outside your suit.
So East has a so-so preempt, since the @D suit is closely related to Swiss Cheese.  But if your style allows it, this is a
reasonable - not great - preempt. It takes some bidding room from the opps, but mildly deceives partner as to suit quality.|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt||
at|Bottom Line: discuss with your partner what your opening preempts show.  After 3@D, what should South do? |
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


at|
My preference is a simple double. If pard bids 4@C, I will bid 4@h and she can then choose a Major. South is interested
in the Majors and is good enough to remove 4@C to 4@h.
CarlieG:  What is the advantage of double over michael's cuebid?
mitche:  4@d is probably not Michaels here. Most pairs do not use it at the 4 level.  Also, double can allow North to show 
a good hand with a jump to 4 of a Major, which would allow  N/S to reach slam when that is right.  And finally, X allows N/S
to reach 3NT when that is correct, 4@d passes 3NT.|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Imagine that North has something like  @sQx,@Hxx,@DQJx,@cAQ10xxx. 
Would you rather be in 3NT or 4 of a Major on those cards?  
Remember that a double at the 3 level shows a pretty decent hand.

at|mitche:  Play:  Carlie made a nice play by rejecting the spade finesse.  Here is why it was a nice play. East has some 
points in diamonds for her 3@D bid, at least the King and one other honor.  And she had the @CA.
With the @SK, @CA, and a decent 7 bagger in @D's, East would be too strong for a preemptive 3@D bid.  So that means West 
is odds-on to hold the @SK.  If so, there is no point in finessing when you are sure it's going to lose. 
Hence the @SA.|

at|mitche:  Bidding:  Some would find it uncomfortable to double with East hand. The argument is that you may wind up in 
a 4-3 fit or even a 3-3 fit if advancer has 4 diamonds.  The other side of the coin is East may never get into the auction 
if she waits to bid. I think it's partially a matter of style whether you do something with the East hand.  

You know that I am pretty aggressive competing for part scores (my matchpoint predeliction).  So I would have doubled, too.
West is correct with his 8 count to bid 1@h, but I would also have sympathy for a 2@d bid, meaning "Pick a Major." 
NOTE that 2@D here in this particular auction is NOT "bid NT with a @D stopper" and it is NOT game forcing. |
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: It just says, pick a Major.  It is possible that East doubled with 4-3 in the Majors, so 2@D says "Let's find 
our 4-4 fit."  And once East bids, that is that. West will pass with fewer than 10 points, raise with a good 10, or bid 
game with 13 dummy points.
BILAsst10: Is there a minimum count for that cue bid?

mitche:  I think about 8 or 9, since with a weaker hand, West would just want to stay low.  You want a minimum of 22 points
to get to the 2 level. So 13 + 8 = 21, close enough. Note that is 22 total points, including distribution.

at|mitche:  Play:  What did South play at trick 1 on the high @D lead?  What should North do after seeing the lowest 
outstanding @D from her partner?  Yep.  Shift to clubs.  The spade finesse is on, and declarer denied as many as 9 points.  
If pard has heart strength, it won't go away, but clubs need to be established for the defense.  It looks dangerous.  But 
if South doesn't have clubs, he will be guaranteed to have heart cards.  Declarer cannot have enough stuff to discard a @D
loser.  If he has just 2 spades, pard would have had 5 and would then have bid 1@S over the X.|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


nt||
at|ecolodge:  What club would you lead? 
mitche:  I would lead the @c8 and hope pard could read it as low.  
One further point on defense (this is counting): Declarer showed up with 3 spades, 4 hearts, and 2 diamonds in play, so when
South got in at trick 11 with a high club, he can get 1 more trick for the defense by playing a club instead of the @HQ.  
Declarer is known to have the @HK and a black card.  So playing a club cannot cost a trick and may cause declarer to ruff, 
allowing @HQ to score for the defense.|

e) something else?
Let's start by saying what I would not bid: that is pass. This is a pretty decent hand after 1@S X.
Redouble shows 10+ points which says that the hand belongs to our side. So if North has a full opening bid, the hand looks 
like it belongs to N/S.  Most pairs play that after a takeout X, 1 level bids are 1 round force, 2 level bids are weak.  
2@h then, shows a weaker hand with this heart suit.  So I'd be leery of 2@h. I might wind up playing there when we are 
making 3NT.|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  I would consider XX or 1NT, and my preference is XX.
If this hand is a misfit, then N/S, with the balance of power, may wish to double at the 3 or even 2 level.  Here E/W 
would be lucky to make 2@C, and down at 3@c.
I think it was Richard Oshlag who said once, "when in doubt, carry them out".. so XX, and South bids 2@h over 2@C.

at|mitche:  Play:  East has a tough opening lead.  The 1NT bid by South says that her honors are likely to be in the vise, 
between 2 hands with points, and a broke partner.  I might try Ace and a trump here, hoping not to give anything away.
When the defense wins trick 1, West can see that a heart continuation will set the entire suit up for declarer.
So she should shift to a minor, either @D or @c, to remove a dummy entry before declarer can generate a lot of pitches 
on the hearts. I'd shift to the @CJ.|
pg| ***** 108 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  An easy way to see that a shift is needed:  declarer cannot get rid of any heart losers in hand (has none) 
and if the  defense is going to succeed, West can see it will need tricks from the minors.
This is an important point:  declarer has almost surely 6 spades for the 2@S rebid, and partner has strength in the minors 
for the double.  If you visualize the play after a heart lead, you can see declarer getting to dummy with a club or a 
diamond to pitch on hearts. Leading a @D works if East has a suit headed by KJ9 or even Q109.
And if declarer has the @CQ or @CA it is hopeless. So I play for pard to have those cards, and I kill one entry before 
declarer can pitch losers there.|

at|mitche:  Bidding:  There were several bids worth discussing.
First, West has much too much strength for a simple 2@D bid, which shows a maximum of about 17 points.
West's hand has 17 HCP, a very good @D suit (a "quality suit" in Bergen's terminology), and a singleton.
I think double is the right way to start this hand off.  Pard could have spades..even more reason for X.
After 2@D, a 3@h bid is preemptive and weak, as the alert said it was. But the hand was not preemptive and weak.
North has a balanced 7 count (with well-located @D honors).|
pg| ***** 117 ***** |

at|mitche:  This is that awkward hand where you have no really good bid.  There are some conventions to deal with this 
problem, and you have a choice between a doggy 2@h or an aggressive 3@h. But a direct raise to 3@h with no shape and 
defensive values is going to result in too many missed games.  I would opt for the underbid of 2@h and then raise to 
3@h later, if the auction allows me to.
ecolodge:  If I bid 2@H after West's 2@D bid, am I not telling my partner I have 10 pts?|
pg| ***** 118 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  NO, asimple raise, but I may correct with 3@h bid later  (LAW).   Pard will realize that I must have made
an underbid when I freely bid to the 3 level.
mcannon:  I would have passed if Pard had bid 2@H.
mitche:  If South passes 2@h, she might get pushed to 3, but N/S would be in 3@h undoubled.
Finally, I think that South should pass 3@h unless she thought it was a limit raise. 
But most everyone plays that an immediate cue bid by responder is limit raise+.|
pg| ***** 119 ***** |


nt||
at|mcannon:  So 2@D from West & 3@Ds from North, would be a limit raise. 
mitche:  Since the cue bid (3@D) is not very useful, almost all pairs use it for the stronger raise to the 3 level.  
It has become very common to use the jump to 3 of a Major as a weak raise, either in competition or without, like Bergen 
or Rev Berg.  Well, a Bergen idea, following the Law of Total Tricks. 1M - 3M is preemptive raise, a la Bergen (and is 
alertable, by the way).  But here is the key idea: a weak 3@h raise should show some distribution, probably shortness in 
the overcalled suit, and 0-6 HCP.  Someone asked if Bergen is off by passed hand.  Yes it is, you use Drury (or BROMAD or 
the cue bid raise).  So this is not a Bergen raise situation.

at|mitche:  Bidding:  South wanted to correct her 2@C to double, which is what she started out doing in the first place.  
So I guess I was the meanie for not letting her do so.  Anyway, after 2@h comes around to her, South might try 2@S instead 
of 3@C.  If South does double, there is a risk that North will jump in hearts, which is not a happy situation, and so you 
could make a case to bid 2@C and then bid spades.  As has been said, there are no absolutes in this game.
Here, either X or 2@C followed by 2@S will allow N/S to bid up to 3@S, which is making, losing a trump, a club, a heart, 
and a diamond.  If South doubles 1@D, she will get lucky when North bids 1@S... so who knows???

at|mitche:  Play:  As you may recall, when South led the @D8, North went up with the @DQ.  As a defender, you should usually
play the lowest of equals, here the @DJ. 
The @DQ could be a tricky card to deceive declarer about the location of the @DJ... but it's usually correct to play the 
lower of touching honors.  And when declarer played the @DK, South feared losing her @HK, so she ruffed with it.|

at|mitche:  Summary: the last 2 hands point out the difficulty with following a formula: on deal 5, I think it was right 
to double with 17 HCP and a 2-suited hand.  Here, it was more debatable, and double could have landed N/S in the soup.

at|mitche:  Bidding:  South has a mammoth hand and after the third seat 1@h bid, she has to wonder what to do.  I think 
that 3NT is a practical bid.  I also think south could try double, followed by 2@h and then 3NT.
That may discourage North from the 4@S transfer (which is also quite reasonable on this auction, assuming 3NT to show a 
balanced monster).

at|mitche: Bidding:  Let's first look at 2@C.   North is passed hand, so his hand is limited. Therefore 2@C should not be 
4th suit forcing to game.  It should invite pard to make a natural bid, which could include 2@h with 3 cards in support.
Should North have bid 1@h over the double?  What other bids would you consider with North hand, if any? 
Let me list possible bids:  a) pass;  b) 1H;  c) XX;  d) 2 @C.
Pass is out of the question, and XX should be, too, since @SK singleton may be worthless. I think that with 
5 hearts, bidding 1@h would work if pard has support, and since we care about playing in Majors, bidding 1@h has the 
advantage of getting to that suit if it's  right. So 1@H has that going for it. |
pg| ***** 162 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  The alternative, 2@C has the advantage of getting the defense off to the right start if East gets into the auction.
At the table I bid 1@h here.  The discussion is to get you to think why a bid might be better than an alternative auction.
azin: North could not bid 2@C as he hardly could count to 10 points.
mitche:  After the double, you do NOT need 10 points to bid at the 2 level.  With 10+ HCP, the correct action over 
a double is redouble.  You are telling opener your side has the balance of strength and should look for an opportunity 
to penalize the doubler''s side when they run from 1@D - X - XX, which you hope to make just on strength alone.
So 1@D  X  XX means a)we look for a chance to collect a fat penalty , or b)we are strong enough to look for game. |
pg| ***** 163 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Example: Let's change North hand slightly to @sx,@hKJ10xx,@DJx,@cKQJxx.  Redouble.  If they have a spade fit,
they are going to be playing it at the 3 level on 15 or so points max.

Maybe 3@S makes in our hypothetical auction, but I think that repeated trump leads would bury that contract 
when we have 23+ points.  |
pg| ***** 164 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  I want to discuss one other bid: after 2@c, South bid 2NT.  A better: bid 2@D.
Why?   a) You have 6 of them, and a pretty decent 6 bagger, too.. and a very distributional hand. 2@D makes at least 3 
(more if the defense slips up).
And b) responder rates to be very distributional for his 2 bids, and South has no values or length in either of North's suits.
Misfits don't like being played in NT unless you have a LOT of strength in the combined hands.

at|mitche:  Play: The defense is entitled to 5 tricks : 3 hearts, the @DK and the @CA.  After the @DK won, West got 
out with a @D.  Now SOUTH should lead a club toward  dummy.  West can win this trick and cash out, but if West ducks, 
declarer will scoot home with 9 tricks.  
azin: West really did not have a good opening lead. What would be your choice?  And would you stop playing hearts after 
the ace?
mitche:  West should probably lead a small club after the @HA, the intent being to cut declarer off from the clubs. When East 
gives count in clubs, West will know to win the second club.|
pg| ***** 181 ***** |


nt||
at|GG_Bridge:  What should I have played after the @dK win?  
mitche:  After winning the @DK, might as well cash your hearts. Your partner will win the Queen and shift to a spade I think.  
You now come to your 5 defensive tricks, since that defense will see declarer has all the rest.
azin: I was told leading Ace against NT contract has special meaning-partner should drop an honor or give count.
mitche:  If you play the lead of the A asks for unblock, then West should play the K at trick 1. 
BTW, that is the standard way to play the lead of an ace.  |

at|mitche:  Bidding:  South has a pretty big hand over the 2@h bid.
2@S here should be about 16 points maximum, so South has to find a stronger bid, and my preference is double.

If she does double, North will have to decide between 3@C or 3@D.  3@D should lead to 3NT, and at IMPS, anyway, 
3@C might get N/S to 5.

at|mitche:  Play:  South can count losers as follows: clubs  0 or 1; diamonds 0, with an extra winner in dummy. hearts 
(on lead) 1, and spades, probably 2.
When the club suit went around once without a ruff, South has to decide how to play trumps.  I think the safest line is 
to lead a small trump from hand at trick 3 toward dummy;  if West plays small to put in the 8.  If it loses to a singleton 9,
I don't know you, but if it forces an honor, then declarer can lead a second small trump toward the 10 later and assure at 
most 2 spade losers.|
pg| ***** 202 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Later in the play, declarer abandoned trumps with 2 of them out and instead played clubs, allowing the defense 
to score both trumps separately.  Play a trump from hand - if they split, you lose just 1 trick, else you can revert to clubs 
to force the defense to ruff. Here trumps are 3-3 so declarer can make 10 tricks.
RealRowdy:  Moral:   don't leave your kids out.
mitche:  Unless you need to keep your trumps for something else!|
