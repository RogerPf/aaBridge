fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned SAYC, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."
Mitch Edelman aka mitche 


MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.
Thank you Eileen (wyoming33) for sending the hands and editing the chatlog! @h

pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|mitche:  Bidding:   South has to anticipate a spade bid from someone.  
Since bidding a red suit after opening 1@C is a reverse, South may wish to open 1@D 
(yes, he had a nice hand, but not *that* nice)|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|  
Then, he can bid 2@c over partner's 1@s response, should partner respond 1@S.
And if someone else overcalls 1@S, South can reopen with a double, which would be for takeout.
That is the first difficult challenge for this hand.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So South opened 1@C and West bid 1@S, pass, pass.  South should reopen with a Double. 
If South decides to bid a second suit, he should bid 2@D, not 2@h for 2 reasons: 
- First, if North has hearts, he may have made a negative X, 
- but second, and more importantly - North will expect better hearts.
A reverse into 2@d may, and often IS made as a convenient way to establish a forcing auction.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||at|
So 1@C followed by 2@D MIGHT NOT ALWAYS promise a "genuine" @D suit. 
It's the least lie.
But by far, if South opens 1@C and is faced with the auction we had, he should reopen with a double.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|
Should North convert the X to penalty?  Remember the rule of 10 and 12?|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||at|OK, briefly subtract the number of tricks West is contracting from 12, and here you get 12 - 7 = 5 
If you have at least that many trumps, next see if you qualify for the rule of 10.
Subtract the number of tricks West contracts from 10, 10-7 = 3. 
You need at least that many trump tricks to convert the X to penalty.  
Also, you should not have a 3-card or longer fit for partner's suit.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||at|
Here, North had the right number of trumps, but she would need KJ10xx or better to give her a shot at 3 trump tricks, 
so she should NOT convert the double.  That tip is from Ron Klinger (Ardek on BBO).

(MM: Only it would not apply here, as East had bid 1NT prior to the possible take out X by South,
ie. contract is not 1@s)

at|mitche: Play: Declarer counts at least 1 trump loser, 3 diamonds, 3 hearts, he has to manufacture 3 tricks.
One might come from the @HQ (lead little toward dummy) and ruff another heart.
So at trick 2, best line is to ruff a spade, and play a heart toward the @hQ 
If the @hK is onside, you have eliminated 2 losers and given yourself the best shot at making.
More than that, you need to see the hands, which you probably can't..|

sk||
at|mitche: Bidding:  South has a more or less routine 6511 hand with which he could bid 2@D over 1@d. 
By the way, East probably remembered the discussion and opened 1@D instead of 1@C.. good thinking, Lewie :)
South's 2@d call, had he made it, is a "Michaels Cue bid", invented by Mike Michaels about 50 years ago.  
A cue bid of opener's 1@C or 1@D bid promises the MAJORS, at least 5-5.  
And a cue bid of opener's MAJOR (1@h or 1@s) shows the OTHER MAJOR and a minor, again 5-5.  
Strength is something we can discuss later.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So here, South could get his giraffe off his chest with a 2@D cue bid. 
North, knowing that South has the majors, can blast to 4 hearts over anything West might say. 
That might be enough to keep E/W from their cold 5@D game.   
And 4@h has a play (they have to pin the singleton K without wasting the @hQ).|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


at|
One other point -- when West bid 2@s, he advertised a limit raise or better in diamonds.
East might have bid 3@c, which could have given West enough information to bid 3NT, if that were the right spot to play.

at|mitche: Play: when the club singleton hit the table, E/W are guaranteed 11 tricks 
As it happens, the hand cannot be defeated. The defense can establish a spade but can never get in to cash it. 
WestElsdon:  Should I have led either of the unsupported Aces?
mitche:  Yes, if North has the @CA, you always defeat the contract, as long as your 2 Major suit Aces live.  
So play an Ace, either one.|

|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


SK||

at|mitche: Bidding:  Another wild hand.. 
After 1@H 2@d, South can and should preempt to 3 (or even 4) hearts.  
2@h is very, very conservative, maybe even too cautious.
3@h might be the winning bid, or 4 might. You don't know.
When West raises to 3@d, North might pass, as South's 2@h should be on junk. 
WestElsdon:  Doesn't 3 or 4 imply fewer points? |
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Well, yes, but over 2@h, vulnerable, West has to have some values. 
West has a hard problem after 2@h, since East has to have some values for 2@d vulnerable opposite a passing partner.|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


at|
Turns out that E/W can make just 9 tricks in @D because spades are bad 
(and in fact, declarer will probably lose 2 spades or a spade and a ruff). 
3@d may be the best bid for West.|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So, why should South preempt in hearts?
A Law of Total Tricks answer is that South knows N/S have at least 9 hearts and so the 3 level should be safe.
Also, with wild distribution, a 3@h bid may push N/S to an unmakeable contract.
(prevents a possible makable 2NT contract) 
And finally -- with an outside 6-card suit, South might be able to set it up for discards.|

at|mitch:  Play:   At 3@h, North has 3 diamonds and 4 clubs to worry about. 
Her best chance to make is to ruff a lot of losers, possibly a cross ruff, scoring the @DA, 3 diamond ruffs, and 5 hearts 
in hand on a cross ruff, which is what she set out to do.
Dummy doesn't have the entries to set up and cash spades, so cross ruffing looks right.
I would make just 1 change to the way declarer played the hand; pitch a club instead of a spade. 
You can always ruff spades in hand.|
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Defensively - East must win the first club so as not to get endplayed later on.  
When East ducks the first club, he will be left on lead, and declarer will not have any chance to go wrong in hearts in the endgame.
Not obvious, but the best defense here is for E/W to lead trumps.

pg| ***** 74 ***** |


at|mitche: Bidding:  Suppose that you play Drury (which I think is a good idea). 
Then North has a problem with his bid over 1@S. 
If you play the recommended 2-way reversed Drury, then 2@d would promise a limit raise with 4 card support.|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


at| 
If you do play that convention, North would have to bid 1NT and over South's rebid, find a suitable call.  
Here, South would likely bid 3@s over 1NT, and North should bid 4.|
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


nt||at|MM: Bridgeguys will state: 2-way REVERSED: 2@c = the 4-card raise,  2@d is now the 3-card raise

pg| ***** 77 ***** |

Bridgehands refers to Two-way Reverse "Bergen" Drury:     2@c = 3-card        2@d = 4-card support

Reversed: Back to your Major is the "subminimal hand":
pass       1@h
- 2@c       2@h = MINIMAL values       and        2@d = possitive response ( = true opener, slow shows values)

at|mitche: Bidding:  N/S managed to miss their 4-4 heart fit. 
Lucky for them, because the 5-0 split would doom 4@h.  That said, how should the bidding have gone?
What would it mean if over 2@C, South had bid 2@h?|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


at|
I think the standard meaning is "non-forcing, constructive", meaning a decent heart suit, probably 5, 
and tolerance for clubs, and about 9-10 points.|
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  The problem is not with any of the bids N/S made, but rather with standard bidding methods.
Once North bids 2@C, it is hard to find a heart contract without some tools.

at|mitche: Play: East led his partner's suit (good idea) and declarer must play the @SQ, which was covered. 
With the spade, declarer counts 2 clubs, 4 hearts.  The 8th trick came from the clubs.

East cannot duck the @C9, is what it boils down to. What possible holding could the @c9 be from? @cKT9?  
If so, the declarer has a void in clubs, and it cannot hurt to win the first club with the J or Q.|

at|msphola:  A diamond switch would have been deadly.
mitche:  Well, a diamond or heart would have been better.  How can West know to lead a red card?|

Here is the hint. 
Declarer must have both a spade stop and a club card and is planning (hoping) to run clubs, 
else she would not have bid 2NT as a passed hand and a weak balancing action.  
So a heart would have been my preference, since that is declarer's trick to the club suit. |

at|mitche: Bidding:  I don't know if I would bid 1NT or 2@h with the South hand 
Experience teaches I that need either better hearts or a better fit with pard to bid 2@h on what could be misfitting hand.
It's pretty close here.  Some 2 over 1 players would choose 2@h and some 1NT.|

The fact that North opened in third seat also enters into the picture.  
North could open light in third seat, complicating things even more. 
This is not an easy hand to bid for South.  |

at|mitche:  But South chose 2@h.  
And now 3@C by North is what some refer to as a "high reverse", and it shows a strong hand, which he certainly has.  
6@c is making, I think, but it is pretty hard to get to.
btour:  If she bid 1NT, I would have jumped to 3@C.      (MM: "she" refers to "my partner")
mitche:  Bob, your sequence shows that strength already -- 3NT is certainly reasonable.
(MM: With partner making a GF with 3@c, South (passed with 12 HCP), @sQ in partner's suit, might make a move to slam?)

at|mitche: Play: After declarer receives the gift of a small @D lead at trick 1 
(don't fret, Tom, it's the normal opening lead against NT), south can afford to play the @SQ and let it float or 
just play a small spade off dummy.
If West wins the @SK at trick 2, that is the defense's last trick.
And if he allows the @SQ to win, declarer plays a heart and then @SA and another spade to achieve the same effect.|

at|mitche:  These hands are why my regular partner and I have moved to a precision-like system because we find it useful 
to employ asking bids.
Tonight's deals were designed by some mad programmer to make all of us nuts.
Thanks to Eileen for her generous assistance and to all of you for your courteous attention and participation.
MM: You can play the hand Double Dummy if you wish
This concludes this presentation, hope you enjoyed, Karen10 & GG_Bridge|
