MM: The recommended screen resolution for .lin movies is 1440 x 900 pixels 
(rightclick on your desktop,select "personalize" "screen defenitions")
Also, make sure you have "widescreen" checked in your windows BBO-version
(If you're not sure about your settings log into your BBO windows version then:  
click the yellow tool at bottom and under the "general" tab check "widescreen" and save)
This will prevent the "cutting off" of the bottom parts or scrambling of your text in these presentations.

If you downloaded BBO recently, you will not be able to get online with the windows version...
You can still change or check your settings: 
Go to your C disc, and under "programs" find the Bridge Base Online folder
Open it and find the "profiles" folder
Open and scroll to find: BBO_Default_Settings 
line 71 should read: WIDE_CLIENT=1
If your setting is 0, change it to 1 and save. This will change your settings to "widescreen".

As an ALTERNATIVE: Open your aaBridge program and simply drag and drop the file of this presentation 
on the aaBridge screen. 
If you don't have aaBridge yet, here is a link for the download:

Leading a @d could save declarer from a guess, if he has one in that suit...
And if partner has 2 tricks, then the contract is already beaten.|

This @hAce in declarer's hand is a bad surprise and we hardly may expect much more with partner (outside his @hKQ)

North most likely has just a singleton trump (6-1-3-3)|

pg| ***** 43 ***** |


at|
It looks like declarer has 1 more  @c... (partner showed odd so West is even) 
Which means we have one more trick there, so we need just one more...
Even though it looks like we have a spade trick, it will disappear on @c's later.
What about declarer's distribution?    6 @d's + 2 @c's +  ??|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt||at|
zaXXon: Declarer should not have a 4-card Major.... partner is not likely to have 7 @h's either,
So 2=3=6=2 is most likely.|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |

If we find partner with a singleton trump honor, Declarer could take it and finesse us later, 
....but only if we leave him with enough trumps in dummy to do so!|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt||at|
zaXXon: So we have to shorten dummy's trumps, before the @c-suit is cleared!
Partner's @c2 tells that we are 3-3 in @c 
We have to start now or never... |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


nt||sk|w|up|3|at|(MM: What seems to be declarer's plan? What keeps declarer from pulling trump? 
What keeps declarer from ruffing his heart losers?
With 2 club losers and a 2 @h losers, declarer plans to dump @h's on the eventually set up clubs..
not "wasting" dummy's trumps to ruff the losers in his hand...as then he totally relies on a 2-2 @d-split...
IF his plan works, declarer does not depend on 2-2 in diamonds as he can still finesse us.
Apparently he hopes defense will "forget about" the @h suit with dummy's void..
But when defense does not   "forget about the hearts", they do exactly what declarer tried to avoid...)
