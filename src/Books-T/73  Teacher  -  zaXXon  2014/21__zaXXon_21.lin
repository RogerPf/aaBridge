MM: The recommended screen resolution for .lin movies is 1440 x 900 pixels 
(rightclick on your desktop,select "personalize" "screen definitions")
Also, make sure you have "widescreen" checked in your windows BBO-version
(If you're not sure about your settings log into your BBO windows version then:  
click the yellow tool at bottom and under the "general" tab check "widescreen" and save)
This will prevent the "cutting off" of the bottom parts or scrambling of your text in these presentations.

If you downloaded BBO recently, you will not be able to get online with the windows version...
You can still change or check your settings: 
Go to your C disc, and under "programs" find the Bridge Base Online folder
Open it and find the "profiles" folder
Open and scroll to find: BBO_Default_Settings 
line 71 should read: WIDE_CLIENT=1
If your setting is 0, change it to 1 and save. This will change your settings to "widescreen".

As an ALTERNATIVE: Open your aaBridge program and simply drag and drop the file of this presentation 
on the aaBridge screen.

^b@2zaXXon:  Hello friends, welcome.  

We have spent already several weeks on defensive play. 
Most of the time, however, we were "alone" in that battle. 
We were looking for the "special" cards, which should help us to collect needed tricks;
... we tried to kill declarer entries;
...we promoted our trump holdings...    and so on.

However, defending most of the time is a two man job and we need our partner to cooperate. 
You have no idea how difficult this is. You (with partner) both want to beat the contract
but, if you take different roads, your job will fail.
In moments like this, you need to transfer to partner as much information as possible,
to direct him towards the needed cooperation.
This partnership is a long story and needs a lot of time to be discussed. 

From time to time, there is another person to ask for help...
...the declarer!
How can we achieve this? |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


at|          Well, we may just ask him :)

OK. Let us start with simple deal to warm up :)


MM: @d@dMany thanks to David (Major_blue) for saving the hands and editing the chat for this presentation!
And special thanks to Eileen (wyoming33), always there to help out! @d@d

Let us try to look over the full deal and to plan what will happen ...   it is not very hard to predict.|

As you notice, partner must have the @SJ, else declarer has 9 tricks.

We don't need so much from partner but we had to keep him in! 
If we play alone, declarer makes his contract.

We should not discard @S's either,    if we throw a winner, declarer could play @d's safely....
If we discard 2 hearts, we bare the King....|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: OK, but we don't show our hand, right?
Let us imagine we have 5 spades, ^*u4^*n hearts, ^*u2^*n diamonds and 2 clubs instead.
In that case, we would discard 2 hearts, right?
Maybe to succeed we need to convince declarer we started with just two @d's!
Getting him down needs 4 @S-tricks and one more.
So we start painting our (fake) picture for declarer with the @hJ

How do you think we can get to partner then?
We may try with     "Your move, partner"    lol

If so, after @cA and @dK declarer is "locked" in the dummy
before or after @dQ, he has to play @c... and we will get our ruff,
