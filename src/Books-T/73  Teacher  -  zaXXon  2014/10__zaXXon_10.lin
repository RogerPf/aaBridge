MM: The recommended screen resolution for .lin movies is 1440 x 900 pixels 
(rightclick on your desktop,select "personalize" "screen defenitions")
Also, make sure you have "widescreen" checked in your windows BBO-version
(If you're not sure about your settings log into your BBO windows version then:  
click the yellow tool at bottom and under the "general" tab check "widescreen" and save)
This will prevent the "cutting off" of the bottom parts or scrambling of your text in these presentations.

If you downloaded BBO recently, you will not be able to get online with the windows version...
You can still change or check your settings: 
Go to your C disc, and under "programs" find the Bridge Base Online folder
Open it and find the "profiles" folder
Open and scroll to find: BBO_Default_Settings 
line 71 should read: WIDE_CLIENT=1
If your setting is 0, change it to 1 and save. This will change your settings to "widescreen".

As an ALTERNATIVE: Open your aaBridge program and simply drag and drop the file of this presentation 
on the aaBridge screen.

^b@2zaXXon:  Hi all and welcome.

For a few months already we are training to "guess" a wide range of suits in different circumstances.
I suppose we are now better in that, or at least a bit.

Soon we will move ourselves to the defender's chair to try to improve our skills there.
Before that however, we will spend some time on a few more major guesses 
- not how to tackle a single suit...
....but which suit to play at all. 
And which one first.

Most often, these decisions depend on the contract and our position in it. 
Let me show you.
Let's start with board 1


LadyStar17:  @D@D Join Zaxxon on Fridays at 4 PM EDT for a six board free tourney. 
Zaxxon will host this tourney and make rounds of the tables and comment and answer questions. 
It will be an exciting afternoon. Check tournament listings on Friday @H@H


MM: Many thanks to David (Major_blue) for saving the hands and editing the chat for this presentation!

|mb|1Dp2Np3Nppp|at|zaXXon: To tell you the truth, I don't know which bid is correct here, with 11 HCP
1NT (Forcing 1NT) or 2NT - I agree (and disagree) with both :)
Still, we have a 5-card suit and some middle cards in the Majors, so let's choose 2NT
(not important for our theme)
|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||

pc|s3|at|zaXXon: I don't remember an easier 3NT during our Tuesdays, do you?   :)
BILAsst11:  We expect there will be a catch
zaXXon: Don't be prejudiced
True, @S3 is smallest spade out. But you ask and get an answer - opps lead 3rd/5th
Not 4th best, but 5th best, meaning West has either 3 or 5 spades
or in other words - defence has at least 4 @S's and the @HA, when @H's are played.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||

pc|S2|pc|SQ|pc|SK|at|zaXXon: Now, which suit to play?
This question depends on the count, as usual.
We have 6 tricks ‘off the top' and if @D's behave - we have an easy 9, if not, 
we definitely need the @C finesse 
If @C's come 3-2 with the Queen in west, we again have 9 tricks|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: So which suit should we try first?
And how?|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


lb|*cWhat should South lead?^^d5^S94HKT2CK8752DQ5|at|
@DQ looks like the natural move...but it's wrong
Consider this: We win trick 2 with @DQ and the next with the @DA.... 
Then we see a bad @D break - and even worse - we are badly placed to play @C's
(stuck in dummy with no way back if clubs are 3-2)
Let's see that|

up|25|pf|y|at|zaXXon: We should try @D's first, because we don't have a finesse there.
So, the correct line should be to plan to stay in hand on the 2nd @D-trick 
If both follow (3-2), then we have 9 tricks
wyoming33: If they do break then have the @CAce to return to @D's in dummy,  got it!!
zaXXon: Yes - If not, we can finesse the @CQ and cash 9 tricks with variant 2|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: Just a little prediction what could go wrong
and we have a second chance
btour:  What if opps played 4th best would you play the same?
zaXXon: You should play the same, you can't give a @D to them, because they have at least 5 tricks already 
(4@S's + @HA if they get in)
So, you should grab 9 first|

...and now is your time to shine - which suit to play and how?|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |

And should you take in hand or dummy?|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt||at|wyoming33: Have to develop some @D
veeree:  Play clubs 
annmorton:  See if @H's split
stanira3: Need to set up @C trick while still have @S control
Major_Blue: I expect split honors in @D's so maybe lead @DJ and hope W covers
|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt||



at|zaXXon: Well, I see some of you are focused on @D's, the rest in @C's
and annmorton wants to play hearts :)
Well, I have not seen how many tricks we have?
Did somebody count?|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: 6
We can develop 2 in @C's, but they are not "Quick Tricks",  and 1 more is possible in @H (with a 3-3 split)
Yes, we have only 1 try
If we step wrong (both @d-honors in west), the spades will be wide open
...and we will not have time to change our plan
So, the main question, how many tricks do we need?     2 or 3
|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt||at|Major_Blue: 3 more
zaXXon: Yes, could be 2, however, if the @H's behave 3-3,   and this is the first suit to be played!
and we check how many tricks we have ready!!
If @H's are 3-3, we have 7 and simply play @C's for 2 more|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt||at|
If not, then we should be in dummy to start finessing the diamond suit 
because nothing is sure in @D's, no guarantee honors split, while @C tricks are sure
If playing @H's gives defence 1 more winner this is not a big danger
So, we take the @S lead in hand, to keep entries to dummy

up|21|pf|y|at|zaXXon: Well done,  Annmorton.  If it was a sense - it's a good sense
The odds for 3-3 are only 36%, but why lose that chance?
If @H's are not 3-3 and @D's lie badly, than the contract is simply unmakeble
But it would not be smart to play @C's   to later see that you have only 8 tricks, because @H's are not coming.
Or even worse - to be very busy with the bad diamonds, while you have an easy 9 tricks|

Major_Blue: Save @D3    @D's will be entries to dummy. 
zaXXon: We have 8 now.... we could play @S's for the 9th, or we could play the @H suit for it.
The question is, do we have 3 entries to dummy to play @S's 3 times?|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: If we have 3 entries, @S's is safer
msphola:  You have the needed entries, but if @D's are 4-1, we have 2 only. Why do we need 3?
zaXXon: 1st - to knockout @SA, 2nd for the King, 3rd to cash the winner
so, we have to play our stronger suit - diamonds carefully!
To check how many times we can jump to dummy....

wyoming33: Have to develop @H's for 2 more,  but how play this combination?
msphola:  How to play the @H suit?  Have to stay away from @D
annmorton:  @H & @D or 2 @H's
zaXXon: There are 2 suits (both blacks) where everything is clear - nobody can take more than 7 tricks in it
It is never wise to touch @D's with Qxx opposite Jxx  (frozen suit) 
Only if opps play it do you make a trick.|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: So, we need two @H's, but there could be an entry problem
The best way to play @H's (if we take the suit in isolation) is: 
small to K, then Queen (if K is taken), then small to the 10
We don't want to finesse with @H10 on the 2nd round, and then lose to Jx in East
We don't need 3 @H tricks! We have to play safest for 2 only.
The natural line of play is to lead small to @HK first ....|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


nt||
at|but there is a difficult-to-see problem with that play here
It concerns entries to your hand, basically.
Leading to the K and it loses, opponents play another @s
You cash the @hQ next (imagine the J doesn't drop), and need use your @cK to lead towards the 10
(you can't cash your @s Ace first now)
But how will you ever be able to cash it later?

and we lose only if west has singleton Ace or Ax,    and we still have an entry to hand to cash @SAce later.

You can play the hand double dummy now, but I will ask you to lead TOWARDS the @hK 
(natural line of play) at trick 2 rather than lay down the @HQ. 
Then when you are on lead again cash the @HQ. 
Now come to hand (imagine the J has not fallen) to play a 3rd @H to dummy's 106
We would lose our @S Ace :(   because we have only 1 entry to hand - @CK
