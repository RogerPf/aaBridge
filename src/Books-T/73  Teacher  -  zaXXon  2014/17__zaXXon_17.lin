MM: The recommended screen resolution for .lin movies is 1440 x 900 pixels 
(rightclick on your desktop,select "personalize" "screen defenitions")
Also, make sure you have "widescreen" checked in your windows BBO-version
(If you're not sure about your settings log into your BBO windows version then:  
click the yellow tool at bottom and under the "general" tab check "widescreen" and save)
This will prevent the "cutting off" of the bottom parts or scrambling of your text in these presentations.

If you downloaded BBO recently, you will not be able to get online with the windows version...
You can still change or check your settings: 
Go to your C disc, and under "programs" find the Bridge Base Online folder
Open it and find the "profiles" folder
Open and scroll to find: BBO_Default_Settings 
line 71 should read: WIDE_CLIENT=1
If your setting is 0, change it to 1 and save. This will change your settings to "widescreen".

As an ALTERNATIVE: Open your aaBridge program and simply drag and drop the file of this presentation 
on the aaBridge screen.

^b@2zaXXon:  Hello friends, welcome.  I hope you are fine...

We have some contracts to beat today, so - prepare your hammers :)
...and your attention - as you could see, defending is not an easy job.

It's even more complicated, when one defender has all the information and needs to transfer this to his partner!
But we are not there yet. 
We are still "beating the contracts by ourselves".     Or at least we try :)
If you're ready let's start!




MM: @d@dMany thanks to David (Major_blue) for saving the hands and editing the chat for this presentation!@d@d

(having good hands is not common, while defending anyway)
Well, we could enter the bidding with a t/o double
but with a passed partner, we may as well keep quiet...
and maybe it's better we do not give declarer additional information.

pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|
Playing fast is the ^*ulast^*n thing that good players do...
True - sometimes the delay could reveal the situation, if declarer had to guess,
but more often you will play too fast and may make expensive mistakes!|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: So, partner could have 4-5 points...
It could be the @hQ + @SQ and if it is, we have to play small here...|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|
It could be the @SA, in which case we have to jump in with our Ace and play a spade...|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


at|
It could be the @cK, again we have to play the @hA + @c|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: East promised 6+ @h's, look at the bidding... 
and he is going to dispose of some black losers on dummy's diamonds
tjtoo: Partner signalled with @d10  - can't have only one diamond....
so I would play the @hA and play small spade up to North.
zaXXon: partner's @d10 should be a count...
(MM: Would count matter? If it's clear count doesn't matter, isn't it a SPS (Suit Preference Signal?)|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||at|
zaXXon: Partner has a maximum of 2 @h's... is it likely therefore to expect @hQ with him?
No, so we had better play the @hA	
|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


nt||


pc|HA|pc|H2|pc|H9|at|zaXXon: The 2nd problem still remains
@S or @c - looking for @cK or @S ?
Well, there are two clues, both strong.
Let's think back to the 1st trick - Do you think partner would encourage the @c-suit, if he has the K?|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


at|
yes, he should...what card did he play?|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


at|      @c6
|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: So, the missing @c's are the 9 8 7 and 2|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


at|
I believe he could play higher, say if he has K862
Holden47:  We only get 2 tricks if he has the @cK, we can get more if he has the @sAce
zaXXon: Very nice point, Holden47
That is the second clue, the stronger one. We need 3 more tricks
We can't take 3 @c's, can we?|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt||at|tjtoo: I think @d10 was suit preference
zaXXon: Yes, all signs show we have to play @S's, hoping partner has the Ace
6@c looks discouraging, @d10 looks like a SPS for spades, @h9 - he needs a @S urgently :)
These @d's in dummy look too scary, we need to cash our 4 tricks as soon as possible, 
and if possible, of course|

4-5 points is partner's limit.
tjtoo: Enough for @hAce  
zaXXon: Ok, could we count declarer tricks...at least approximately?|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt||at|He must have 3-4 @c tricks    +3 @d (went to @dA, probably had the K too)
+ at least 2 @S-tricks (be sure he has the @sK)
with @SQ in hand, he would not play the Ace at trick 1
so, our only hope comes in hearts...|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt||at|Holden47: I think the only chance to get it down is if W holds the @hK and P holds the Ace...so I lead the @hQ
wyoming33: That might work except for the 1095 in dummy
zaXXon: As you said, we need the @hK in declarer's hand, @hAce in partner's.....|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


hc|hth9h5|at|
....But 1095 in dummy prevent cashing when leading the @hQ!
wyoming33: YES - cannot play the Q|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


lc|hth9h5|nt||at|zaXXon: ^*bDon't forget declarer does not see our cards.^*n
cad: Need to play a small @h and hope declarer goes up with his King
zaXXon: Yes, we hope declarer goes up with the King.   We play 4th highest @h
Guess what declarer will do, having  Kx opposite 109x?
(What would you do, sitting in his seat?)|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt||at|cad: Playing King might be his only hope
zaXXon: If we lead the @hQ, he covers and has a stopper in dummy.
If we lead the @hQ declarer cannot go wrong by covering.       If we lead small he might guess wrongly. 
tjtoo: hmmm - Don't want to promote the 10 either... 
But if West ducks, partner would have to play the Ace to prevent the 10 from taking the trick?
zaXXon: We may lose a trick, playing small.|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt||at|But we are looking for @hKx in declarer's hand, in which case he plays the King (can't be blamed) and goes 2 off
Holden47:  Would he put the King up though, with the 109x in other hand?
zaXXon: Well, change @hAce with @hQ (or @hJ). 
With 3 cards he plays small for sure, but with Kx only - very likely the King|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


nt||at|
btour:  If West does not come up with the @hK what does north do?
zaXXon: Nothing - takes the @hAce - just a nice try. 
He pats West on the back for being a good guesser, as the cards lie.
