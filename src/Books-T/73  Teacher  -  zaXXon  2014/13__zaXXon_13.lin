MM: The recommended screen resolution for .lin movies is 1440 x 900 pixels 
(rightclick on your desktop,select "personalize" "screen defenitions")
Also, make sure you have "widescreen" checked in your windows BBO-version
(If you're not sure about your settings log into your BBO windows version then:  
click the yellow tool at bottom and under the "general" tab check "widescreen" and save)
This will prevent the "cutting off" of the bottom parts or scrambling of your text in these presentations.

If you downloaded BBO recently, you will not be able to get online with the windows version...
You can still change or check your settings: 
Go to your C disc, and under "programs" find the Bridge Base Online folder
Open it and find the "profiles" folder
Open and scroll to find: BBO_Default_Settings 
line 71 should read: WIDE_CLIENT=1
If your setting is 0, change it to 1 and save. This will change your settings to "widescreen".

As an ALTERNATIVE: Open your aaBridge program and simply drag and drop the file of this presentation 
on the aaBridge screen.

^b@2zaXXon:  Hi friends, welcome

I hope you have enjoyed last few months... 
This will be our last discussion as declarers - We will start "defending" from next week.

But don't be disappointed - we will have fun in defenders chair too, I promise :)
Defending is just as entertaining as declaring is.

For today I have kept a mix of nice hands (I hope)




MM: Many thanks to David (Major_blue) for saving the hands and editing the chat for this presentation!

Do you think the hand requires much skill from us ?

Once we play there, the opps will return the same suit (a @d is a safe exit)|

With this play, we add an extra 25% to it.

msphola: If East has the @DA and West the @SK, it goes down
zaXXon: Yes, that's the layout where nothing helps, but increasing our chances is always a good idea.

MM:  For those interested:

For the 2 missing high cards, the @sK and the @dAce there are only 4 possible layouts:

(a) @dAce in West,  @sK in East
(b) @dAce in West, @sK in West
(c) @dAce in East,  @sK in East
(d) @dAce in East,  @sK in West

With 
(a) we are happy = 25% of the time
(b) works for us too = 25% of the time
(c) works as well = 25% of the time
(d) is the layout that will not work = 25% of the time

=> 75% of the time we are "good",    25% of the time we are not

Provided we get the timing right!
And this hand was about the timing!

With the @d Ace in west, then (with good timing) it doesn't matter where the @sK is anymore.
(a) and (c) always work  (50%), we "gained" option (b) (+ 25%)

pc|dq|at|zaXXon: You may think partner's bidding is gambling
And I will agree - it is.
Even so, the slam is completely fair.
Well, we have to take the first trick.

pc|D5|pc|D9|pc|DA|at|zaXXon: The @C suit has to be established somehow
Please, I need your plans|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


at|
We may get 3 or 4 discards on clubs,   depending on how the @C's behave.

Don't forget, that the only quick entry to dummy is in trumps – don't waste them.|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt||at|msphola:  We can't afford to take the @C finesse, 
If clubs break 3-3 you only have to ruff one club
zaXXon: Very nice Mary|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt||at|
How many ruffs we need, depends of how many @C's we can set up!
- If clubs are 3-3 we only need to ruff clubs once and would have 4 discards (for 2 @d's and 2 @s's)
We then need to ruff out 1 spade, and we would survive a 3-1 trump break..
- Or we may need to ruff @C's twice, (4-2 and then only 3 discards) => still need two ruffs for 2 of the remaing 3 losers, 
For this possible layout, we need trumps to be 2-2! 
=> Do we guess to play the clubs 4-2 (and trumps 2-2) or the trumps to be 3-1 (and clubs 3-3)?

pc|hjh6hah4|at|zaXXon: And now?
Holden47:  Ruff @C4 with @HK
zaXXon: And now?    ...we don't know what to do!!!
Play the clubs for 4-2 (where we need hearts to be 2-2 for 3 discards and 2 ruffs)
Or play the clubs for 3-3 where we can defend against a 3-1 heart break as we will only need 1 ruff?
At this point it is tossing a coin...
|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |

That is the problem, we could go wrong, if we're not good guessers.
That is why, we should avoid guessing!

nt||
pc|C3|pc|C9|pc|HT|pc|CQ|at|zaXXon: ...and ruff a 3rd @C (high) and we see how the clubs split!
When the last two Clubs fall we can cash trumps (up to 3-1) and still have a trump in dummy for the last ruff
But:
If @C's are 4-2, we will go to dummy to ruff (high) again and will rely on 2-2 in hearts as that's what we need.
But at least we couldn't go wrong guessing the clubs for 4-2 while they turn up 3-3 with a 3-1 trump split!

wyoming33: Surely we can get a second @H, or a @C if West leads them.
zaXXon: 1 additional in @H - I confirm that too, and the @C problem...
@C's are ^*bdangerous^*n...    but only if East plays them.
If West touches the @C's, we will have 2 stops
So, we have to give to West, if possible.|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt||at|
zaXXon: If we knock out the @D Ace, it could be anywhere...
If we play to the @HQ, East may have the K... so perhaps it's better to play hearts from dummy. 
Then we can keep East off lead.

zaXXon: So lets go to dummy then we need one @H honor in east (will finesse later again)
