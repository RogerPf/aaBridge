MM: The recommended screen resolution for .lin movies is 1440 x 900 pixels 
(rightclick on your desktop,select "personalize" "screen defenitions")
Also, make sure you have "widescreen" checked in your windows BBO-version
(If you're not sure about your settings log into your BBO windows version then:  
click the yellow tool at bottom and under the "general" tab check "widescreen" and save)
This will prevent the "cutting off" of the bottom parts or scrambling of your text in these presentations.

If you downloaded BBO recently, you will not be able to get online with the windows version...
You can still change or check your settings: 
Go to your C disc, and under "programs" find the Bridge Base Online folder
Open it and find the "profiles" folder
Open and scroll to find: BBO_Default_Settings 
line 71 should read: WIDE_CLIENT=1
If your setting is 0, change it to 1 and save. This will change your settings to "widescreen".

As an ALTERNATIVE: Open your aaBridge program and simply drag and drop the file of this presentation 
on the aaBridge screen.

fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^bSession 4: What they DID or DID NOT bid: Counting HCP with "zaXXon"  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2zaXXon: Welcome everybody.
 
During the last few weeks we discussed "how to think", how certain thoughts help us to take the right decision more often.
Our investigations were based on bids, made or not, by our opponents. 
In both cases we receive some information that we can use. 
For example:
"He opened 1@h, hence he must have at least 5 hearts and 11 points" or
"He opened 1@c and now I see he is balanced - he has 12-14 points, else he would open 1NT" or
"He passed and later made a 2@c overcall, this should mean he has 5+ (may be 6) clubs and 9-11 points"

Of course, it could be the contrary:
"He has 5 good spades but he did not overcall - probably he doesn't have enough points to overcall" or 
"He has points but he did not overcall - he doesn't have a good suit"
...and so on...

We should track questions like these all the time.
Once you get the picture how one or two suits are divided, 
you should try to imagine the opponent's hands and try to see which hand fits his bids best.
Let us start with our first example!


LadyStar17:  @D@D Join Zaxxon on Fridays at 4 PM EDT for a six board free tourney. 
Zaxxon will host this tourney and make rounds of the tables and comment and answer questions. 
It will be an exciting afternoon. Check tournament listings on Friday @H@H

MM: Many thanks to David (Major_blue) for saving the hands and editing the chat for this presentation!

Can you find something useful in the bidding?
Did you notice east's spade holding?
But most important: East passed!
He has @sKxx and did not give support
With the @hAce and @sKxx east should have bid 2@s|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: So we have to trust West has the @hA
=> We have to look for the lady (@d)
We cash @c's and were watching carefully
All we can say for sure is that the last 5 cards in West are: @s xx   @h Ace   @d ?x (Qx or xx)
Yes, we placed @hA in west from bidding (missing support from East)
This does not effect the @dQ however




|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


nt||pc|H5|pc|D2|at|East could pass with @sKxx and @d's with or without the Q 
The only clue should be the @d discard from West
Both discard a @D on the last Club. 
But west did it from 3 cards at most (Qxx ?) and East from 4 (Qxxx ?)    :)
So we "place" the @dQ in East....

Discarding a diamond was West's only chance to beat the game. 
If he parts with a spade, we can drive out @hA without risk
So, well done West, tuff luck for us.|

pc|sa|at|zaXXon: This example contains a new variation. 
Sometimes, we have to apply specific conditions, given the hand or a single suit and take a restricted decision.
For example thoughts as: 
"There is nothing to be done if diamonds are 3-1. But if they are 2-2, than I have to...."
 or
"If spades are 4-1, I'm always down. To make my contract I need them.... and then hearts would be .... 
so I have to place Queen....."|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt||at| or even:  
"I need @hAce to be in West, else there is no play for my contract. In that case he would have 9 points and...."
The idea is simple - if we ^*uneed^*n something to happen, 
we should base our plan on that condition. 

We prefer to make the game, when this condition ^*bIS^*n true    (and go -2 when it's not)
to going down "only" 1 without the fight.|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


nt||at|Bidding: We don't want to preempt with such a poor suit but finally, we get in
(please - even if you don't like the bidding, just take it as it is - the hand serves a purpose)
At our second call we pass. 
Double would ask a @h lead (we dont really want it!), but we prefer to play in a heart contract. 
Thus, we won the bidding...can we make it as well?|

Having worked out that East/West have 20 points total, and you see East had @SQ.
Can East also have the @CAce?|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


at|
No, as that would be 6 for east => 14 for west and that is not enough to open 1NT
So both missing Aces should be in west 
We must limit @h's to one loser  (if possible, that is for 2 @s's   1@c and 1 @h)

pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt||

If West has @hAQx, we can do nothing
We need 2-2 in @h's to make it.
So, we need West to have Ax, as Qx is not possible from the bidding

@hK in East; Where is @hQ?|

@hJ most likely in East… (there was no Q-lead from QJ..)|

We sometimes plan the play, based on a special condition.
