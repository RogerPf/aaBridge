MM: The recommended screen resolution for .lin movies is 1440 x 900 pixels 
(rightclick on your desktop,select "personalize" "screen definitions")
Also, make sure you have "widescreen" checked in your windows BBO-version
(If you're not sure about your settings log into your BBO windows version then:  
click the yellow tool at bottom and under the "general" tab check "widescreen" and save)
This will prevent the "cutting off" of the bottom parts or scrambling of your text in these presentations.

If you downloaded BBO recently, you will not be able to get online with the windows version...
You can still change or check your settings: 
Go to your C disc, and under "programs" find the Bridge Base Online folder
Open it and find the "profiles" folder
Open and scroll to find: BBO_Default_Settings 
line 71 should read: WIDE_CLIENT=1
If your setting is 0, change it to 1 and save. This will change your settings to "widescreen".

As an ALTERNATIVE: Open your aaBridge program and simply drag and drop the file of this presentation 
on the aaBridge screen.

^b@2zaXXon:  Hello friends, welcome.  

Are you ready for some fun tonight?
Well, I have found and will use an old file with some old deals..
However, there is a problem with these hands - they're dealt from a dirty old pack of cards 
and one of them  (@S10) is really wet, sticky and dirty.
So, when we happen to hold the @S10 in our hand, we may drop it under the table 
- just to keep our hands clean...
I'm kidding, of course. But there is some truth as well.

Tonight we will try to deceive the declarer a little bit
...and hiding some cards (specially the @S10) may be helpful  :)



MM: @d@dMany thanks to David (Major_blue) for saving the hands and editing the chat for this presentation!
And thanks to Eileen (wyoming33), always there to help out! @d@d

pc|hq|At|zaXXon: After a 1NT response by East, the opponents are in 4@S 
Partner leads the @HQ.
Having most of defense's resources, we can easily calculate all tricks.
What should we expect with declarer for his 1@S and 3NT bids?|

Well, 18-20 balanced seems a fair range, and yes, probably 5332 or so.|

nt||at|zaXXon: Even with 18 only, adding 7 in dummy and our 10....
...leaves partner with 5 at most.
So, besides the @HQJ, he may still have a Queen or Jack
Most Queens and Jacks are visible however, except in @C's
The @CJ is useless, so the @CQ is the max partner can have and which may be helpful.

pc|SQ|at|zaXXon: Now he has real problem... he started, most likely with  @sAKxxx   vs   @sJ9x
He may well finesse the @S10 if spades are   @s10xxx   vs   @sQ  (for North/South)
And if you don't believe in that chance, put yourself in declarer position... |

CarlieG:  Test clubs - where is the Queen?  Small club first
zaXXon: Dummy's diamonds will be established very soon
True - we need 2 @C-tricks and it's time to play for them, small @C is best.
There is no danger of a stiff K, so small is just fine.

Of course, in some deals declarer will have 6 spades and will not be cooked,
but this play has nothing to lose.
As I said, drop the @S10 on the floor :)

Let us try to construct declarer's hand:|

nt||at|zaXXon: @S's we expect to be Axx, right?   So   @sAxx. 
Then 6 hearts with 2 honors may be?   @HAQxxxx (or KQ)     and   4 minor cards.
So, we may expect to take 2@S's + 1 trump + @DA ?|

In any case, it costs us nothing.

We have 3 @S-tricks and the @HK, we need just one more..
Say we take the @hK  ^*uand^*n the @s10    ...and then exit with a @C...
How many tricks does declarer have?    Did somebody count?|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt||at|
1@S,   3@H,   2@C,  2 or 4 @D (4 if he finds the @dQ)
8 or 10, so he needs to find the @DQ
Fine, we cash the @S10, exit with a @C and leave him to guess...
Would he guess correctly? I don't know... but he has a 50% chance with a 2-way finesse
Can we push declarer in the wrong direction?|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: Yes there is a way to make it an at least 80% in our favor chance...|

at|
We do NOT cash this @S... but we exit with a @C
Don't forget that declarer does not know where this @S is!
And if he believes North has it... than he would finesse @D's into the "safe" opponent, us, South.|

We need the @DQ as a trick to beat the contract. 
wyoming33: We may not get that @S though?
zaXXon: Then 9 tricks is a 50% chance if you reveal  the @S10.
In spades south showed an even number, it sure looks like we have the 10, and declarer would finesse us (correctly)
So we do all we can to DENY that @s10 (by not cashing it first) so that it appears that South is the safe hand.|
