mn|Introduction|
fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Session 1: Counting HCP with "zaXXon"  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2zaXXon: We will talk about guesses and decisions in Bridge. 
I have prepared some hands and we will have a discussion during the session. 
Your comments, questions, notes, etc. are always welcome! 
There is nothing wrong in making mistakes - we all do, it is wrong to repeat them again and again.

So please - don't worry and talk with me...it would help both you and me
As you probably already notice, English is not my born language, so I would like to apologize in advance for laxities, which will exist for sure. I'm still learning…
Anyway, let's talk about our favorite game. 

Bridge is a game of decisions - right and wrong. 
We all have to guess all the time, during play 
- where to finesse a queen, which card to put from KJ, finesse or play for a drop..
Good players guess correct more often. 
We want to be better players, so we have to learn to guess right frequently.

If you believe that I will give you secret techniques, magic balls or lucky coins to make only correct guesses, 
...then it's the time to disappoint you - I don't have such attributes :)
Right decisions are mostly based on gathering information. 
There is information all around and it is our business to collect it, sort it out and take a decision, based on it.
The more we know the better!

If we try to make a list
The information we are looking for is twofold: - ^*bhonor points^*n and ^*bdistribution^*n. 
Today and the next few weeks we will focus on honor points.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||cp|2|fp||at|^b@2 

Depending on the bidding, an opponent could promise some points or could limit his hand. 
We have to use this information carefuly.
And now the good news - even though we may not have magic objects -
there are some magic numbers that we will use often :) 
Some of them you may already use, or not

So:
a) 12 ! An opponent is a passed hand, hence he has less than 12 points (even less than 11, nowadays)
or:|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


at|
b)  11 ! The opponent did open 1@c/@d/@h/@s - He has a minimum of 11 HCP
or even more:|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


at|
c)  15 and 17 - The opponent made a NT opening - he should normally have 15-17 HCP 
(20-22 for 2NT opening)
What about 6 ?|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|
d)  6 ! The opponent did open 1@c/@d/@h/@s, but his partner passed - so he has less than 6 HCP

Do you think its easy? You have no idea how many players know this, but not use it!
How to use this numbers? 
That's a tough question and we will try to find an answer together!
Here is the first example, to start with

LadyStar17:  @D@D Join Zaxxon on Fridays at 3 PM EST for a six board free tourney. 
Zaxxon will host this tourney and make rounds of the tables and comment and answer questions. 
It will be an exciting afternoon. Check tournament listings on Friday @H@H

There is no reason to leave trumps out.

Let we try to review what we saw until now.
In @s's we had the AKQ and East showed the Jack
Do you remember the heart suit?|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |

West led @hQ (presumably from QJ)    
and East had @hAKx|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: So, East already showed 8 points
...and he passed the bidding at 2nd seat.
Holding the @cAce, he would probably open the bidding
So, we have a good view and play the @cJ
and we are almost sure in our "guess"

We also saw the @sK in west
Giving West 8 points (or even 9, if he has @dJ as well)....
And again a look in the bidding
West is passed hand - there is no room in his hand for the @hAce
so, the correct guess should be the @hK|

at|zaXXon: The decision what to put from KJ is very popular
and the only information that could help is counting the points
from bids made...or bids missing (as passed hands)
Once somebody opens the bidding but you become a declarer, you expect him to have most of the points
and reverse - nobody opens, but somebody showed a few honors already - try to watch out!
As a passed hand, he has a limit! And we know he can't go over it|

Thank you all for being with me today.
There will also be small tournaments every Friday with prepared hands, similar to Tuesday's sessions, 
so you can get some practice in what you are learning.
And welcome next Tuesday, same time - we have some Queens to catch :) |
