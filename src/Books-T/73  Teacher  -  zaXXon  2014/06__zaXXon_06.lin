MM: The recommended screen resolution for .lin movies is 1440 x 900 pixels 
(rightclick on your desktop,select "personalize" "screen defenitions")
Also, make sure you have "widescreen" checked in your windows BBO-version
(If you're not sure about your settings log into your BBO windows version then:  
click the yellow tool at bottom and under the "general" tab check "widescreen" and save)
This will prevent the "cutting off" of the bottom parts or scrambling of your text in these presentations.

If you downloaded BBO recently, you will not be able to get online with the windows version...
You can still change or check your settings: 
Go to your C disc, and under "programs" find the Bridge Base Online folder
Open it and find the "profiles" folder
Open and scroll to find: BBO_Default_Settings 
line 71 should read: WIDE_CLIENT=1
If your setting is 0, change it to 1 and save. This will change your settings to "widescreen".

As an ALTERNATIVE: Open your aaBridge program and simply drag and drop the file of this presentation 
on the aaBridge screen. 
If you don't have aaBridge yet, here is a link for the download:

^b@2zaXXon:  Welcome people.  It's nice to see you here again.

If you remember, last time we discussed some cases, where we applied specific conditions, while planning the play
We began by thinking "We need something to be right"...
...and plan the play on the assumption that it is in fact true.

Such conditions could work in different ways
Let us see it in examples




LadyStar17:  @D@D Join Zaxxon on Fridays at 4 PM EDT for a six board free tourney.

pc|h9|at|zaXXon: We open 1@S at 3rd seat, with a good hand
Once partner showed a fit, we bid game.
West makes a (natural) lead - very likely to be a short suit
and we are presented with a disappointing dummy.
Can you try to calculate our losers, please.      Go on, don't worry - they're plenty :)|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||at|Eddy: 2@H 2@C and possibly 1@S
zaXXon: Good.  2@H are sure,  1 @C also
We can't afford to give a 2nd @C, nor a @S
So, as you noticed, we ^*uneed^*n 2 key cards well placed - @CA and @SK on our right.
We take the first @H (no need to risk ruffing with hold up)

zaXXon: We can ruff 3rd @C to finesse @SK, if we start with @C's.

The finesse lost....not our lucky day....
And if we continue the hand...we find the @cAce well placed...
Well, don't you wonder where the guess at this hand is? 
Let's back up:|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||up|2|at|zaXXon: We said, we need two keycards placed, but is that possible at all? 
We could be lucky.
We help our luck a little bit. We noticed "natural" lead, but we did not pay attention to it.
We know @HKQ on our right. And we need the @CAce to be there also. That's 9 points.
That's what you want to ask yourself.  Could East also have the @SK ?
|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||pc|SA|pc|SK|at|Yes, it's very lucky
But good card players succeed to catch these lucky distributions. 
Once we decide the @SK cannot be with East we lose nothing by playing the Ace.|

West leads the @S2. Any ideas how to proceed?

pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt||at|wyoming33: Possible @H loser, 2@D and possibly a @C
zaXXon: You are right
To have a @C loser would be very unlucky, East did open. So, we are favourites to succeed.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |

OK - do we take in hand to finesse trumps?
Or we stand in dummy to try @C's?
And last question - some echo from the bidding?|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt||at|sblitz: W probably has fewer than 6 hcp.  Didn't respond to 1@S.
zaXXon: ok, let's see     :)
We can't place East honors so early,  but we can be sure his partner is 0-5 points.
So, if West has the @CK, then @HK would be on our right for sure...|

zaXXon: Can we deal with @cJ965 in East?|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


at|
zaXXon: Yep, we can - if we cash @CK and see west' void
But can we extract it, if @cJ965 all in West?|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


at|
zaXXon: Not if we start with @CK and east discards..
But if we start with @CA and find them all in west, we can finesse twice to dummy
having 2 @D entries|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon:  So, it depends on which honor we cash first, 
from hand (@cA) or from dummy (@cK). 
We can do it if we know who has @cJ965. 
There are no problems if they break 3-1 or 1-3.
How to decide who is more dangerous to have the void?
Do we know something until now, from bidding and play?...
No bids...and no play...just a lead...|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt||at|
If the lead is 4th best (very likely), can we trust West does not have a longer suit to lead?
sblitz:  3 was his lowest @S   (and seeing the @s2 in your hand, that's likely from a 4-card)
zaXXon: It's not a must, of course, but people tend to attack with their longer suit.
And now, the answer to: Who can have the @cJ965 should be clear....|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: If West has a @C void, he would have at least a 5 card suit ...
He can't be 4440... :)
So, IF there is a @c-void, it's more likely to find the void in East!
...and to try to protect against this, by playing W for the 4-card @c|

pc|sk|at|zaXXon: We have a nice hand and partner's dbl over 1@S should get us excited.
We would like to investigate a slam,
as we are almost sure to have @H fit, we bid 5@H
and partner, probably forced, bids to 6@H
This is our first slam to guess.
Are we happy with that dummy?|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt||at|It seems we have no problems outside trumps and we don't have too many worries in trumps either.
We are missing @HA1083
Can we succeed to take all trumps but the Ace, if they are 4-0?
How you think?|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


at|
MB: West has nearly all the missing points ?|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: The common play is to cash one of dummy's honors.
Thus, if we find @hA1083 with RHO we can finesse the 10 later.
But this is not possible, as MB noticed...
From the opening @HAce is on our left
So, if we are unlucky and somebody has 4 trumps, this can be West only.
