Go to your C disc, and under "programs" find the Bridge Base Online folder
Open it and find the "profiles" folder
Open and scroll to find: BBO_Default_Settings 
line 71 should read: WIDE_CLIENT=1
If your setting is 0, change it to 1 and save. This will change your settings to "widescreen".

zaXXon: :) Thanks Joan 
Hello everybody, welcome
For those of you who are joining me for the first time - my name is Zahari, or just Harry :) and I'll be glad to spend a 
few hours with you, talking about our favorite game.
A month ago I was playing a pairs tournament in Bulgaria. As always, after the evening session, we were sitting at the bar with friends discussing the deals, perhaps the best part of the tournament.
As you can imagine, everybody wanted to share their best deals, how well they played a hand, what kind of endplay or squeeze they succeed to execute and so on..
Suddenly, I had realized that all stories were from the declarer point of view. 
Almost nobody tried to describe a good hand in defense.   Well, I found this unfair!
And here we are...  In these 2 sessions I would like to show you the beauty of defense.
The deals are selected from real life and have been played by some of best players in the world ever!
I will share with you who were the star players who had played the hands. And you will be able to try to find their defense.
Let's go. GOOD LUCK |

at|zaXXon: Jeff Meckstroth - USA star, one of the best active players in the world in present time is sitting South.
The hand comes from a team tournament and he had to lead against opponent's simple bidding 1NT - 3NT 
(1NT = 12-14 balanced hand). 
Put yourself in his chair. What would be your opening lead?
Kib: Do we need to know their signaling methods?
zaXXon: Let's say they use 4th best as most popular|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


lb|*cWhat would be your opening lead?^^s4^SJ754H963CAJ65DQ7|nt||at|Kib: It looks like W hasn't got a 4-card major or if so would be 4333

|lb|*cWhich spade should you play?^^sJ^SJ75|nt||at|zaXXon: Well, declarer should have the @sQ, as partner would have played it.
It seems declarer is trying to catch you asleep, so, you play the @sJ and it holds|

at|
zaXXon: Ask yourself why declarer works for one spade trick instead of working for dummy's hearts?|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


at|
Kib:  hearts must be solid
zaXXon: Yes, the answer is that he probably has his hearts ready to cash.
and if so  ..... Then he should now have      3 @s tricks + 5 @h's +   @d Ace
So, Jeff Meckstroth counted - declarer shows 6 points in spades, may be @h KQ  => partner should have the @cK
so, partner should have @cK... but he may not have the @c10 as well..|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |

up|24|pf|y|at|zaXXon: It looks easier, when experts do it
imaquila: Please explain why the lead from 4th down from spades rather than the stronger club suit?
zaXXon: Well, when opponents don't use Stayman to look for Major fit, Major leads should be prefered
and clubs could be a gift more often. ...  and, a small club does not beat the contract :)

MM:You can play the hand Double dummy if you wish by clicking on the cards. (you can try any opening lead)

pc|DT|at|zaXXon: once again, partner can not possibly offer too much as help
Partner, probably having a 1-point hand is trying to hit our longer suit,
and he did.    But...
Can you place declarer's HCP? And how many tricks can you then count for declarer?|

We can be sure that declarer has the   @cAK and   @dAK, maybe the  @hQ as well|

You try to make @d transfer with 2NT, West repeats hearts

nt||at|zaXXon: While partner thinks what to lead, let us discuss the bidding to see what we could make of that.
West should have 6+ hearts and at least 4 @c's, with strong hand, probably.

pg| ***** 113 ***** |


at|zaXXon: Board 6 looks over French star Alain Levy's shoulder, defending against 3NT.
The bidding sequence shows that his LHO should have 22-23 points in a balanced hand, with a 4-card heart suit but 
less than four spades.  |
pg| ***** 114 ***** |


nt||
pc|HQ|at|zaXXon: Partner led the @hQ and Mr. Levy quickly realized that all missing points should be in declarer's hand.
We know he has @sAK, @hAK and @cAK
The conclusion was also automatic - the only chance for defense would appear if declarer has some communication problems 
and defenders succeed to take profit of them.
|

pg| ***** 116 ***** |


pc|DQ|pc|D6|at|zaXXon: Well, declarer got the lead in hand with the @hK
and plays the @dQ, the last missing high card, as partner likely has the @hJ|

nt||
pc|D7|lb|*cWhich diamond will you play?^^d5^DK852|
pc|D5|at|zaXXon: Partner shows an even number with the @d6
and Alain also played small, as declarer started with 2 diamonds
With only 2 diamonds in hand, declarer of course was not quick to repeat the diamond finesse. 
(After all, if we are holding up, where is his 9th trick coming from?)
Maybe a 3rd trick in spades (+ entry if @d finesse fails)...which would happen if spades 3-3, or finding the Q in north , 
Qx or 10x or a singleton Q. All of these would provide a third spade trick,
therefore declarer runs the @sAK|

Playing the Q here, presenting it as a doubleton..
Hear declarer thinking "bingo", Levy started with Q7?    (which would leave @s106 for north)
The rest was just as planned. Once he found the sure entry to dummy in spades, west finessed again in diamonds. |

^*bAn After thought^*n        -      As presented,   declarer can  ^*bnow^*n  take his two aces and exit with a club.

Alain Levy can then do little but cache his two top clubs.   
 
Alain is thrown in and must give up two diamond tricks so declarer will make the 9.     (So Declarer must have got this wrong)|

nt||
up|29|pf|y|at|zaXXon: An advise from this deal:  when you don't see a chance - everything is acceptable
You think you wouldn't fall in that trap, being declarers?
Kib: Declarer could have taken the @sJ and @dA and make his contract
zaXXon: True, make 11 tricks for an IMP or 2  
Or claim 12 tricks ... people are greedy :)       I'm too :)|
pg| ***** 128 ***** |


nt||at|sblitz:  Would you take this "bait" at IMPs, knowing you have 11 tricks if you take the @sJ?
zaXXon: Well, nowadays the VPs table changes at every IMP
If you have a play for 2 overtricks (2 IMPS) and the danger is less then 20% (as example) it rates to take the risk

and partner will not be able to ruff as he has no trumps in his hand...declarer will succeed...unless..
The club must be cashed as soon as possible.|

at|zaXXon: Here we are in board 8, looking in the hand of Eric Rodwell, partnering with Jeff Meckstroth and being together probably one of the best pairs in the world.
2NT shows only a balanced hand, no extras|

pg| ***** 142 ***** |


pc|H4|pc|H7|pc|HA|at|zaXXon: Against 3NT Jeff led the @hJ (perhaps the best lead) which declarer took in hand with the Ace. |
pg| ***** 143 ***** |


nt||
pc|D7|pc|D5|pc|D2|pc|DT|at|zaXXon: Next came @d7, @d5 from Jeff and @d2 from dummy...
Taking it with the @d10, Eric stopped to imagine what is going on. 
If you have suggestions, its time to share it
|
pg| ***** 144 ***** |


nt||lb|*cWhich card would you play?^^sk^SK62HK93CT64DK4|at|msphola:  Did north lead from J108x?
zaXXon: Something like that. And it seems partner started with @dJ5 or @dQ5 for that play.
Kib:  Take @hK and lead @h3 to Q.  Declarer will eventually have to give you your @dK or @sK, then you can take another @h
zaXXon: well, declarer will give a further diamond for sure, but probably not a spade as well
2 diamonds and 2 hearts are not enough for defense
If you could cross to partner somehow...have partner lead another heart..|
pg| ***** 146 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: ok, let's see
Clearly, declarer is trying to establish diamonds, but keeping North out of lead, because a second round of hearts from 
there will crush the contract (3 @h's  2 @d's )
So, an entry to partner has to be created in order to take 3 hearts,  and that has to be made right now. 
(or declarer will be able to take: 1@h  4@d  1@s  and 3 @c's for contract if he holds @cKQx)
But where it could be?|
pg| ***** 147 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: And Eric could see 24 HCP in his hand and in dummy. 
Adding at least 11 for declarer for his opening (probably 12) proved that his partner could hold maximum 4-5 points. 
The @hJ he already led and he should have something like Jx or Qx in diamonds for that play. 
So, he can't have the @cKQ and even if he holds @cKxx, creating an entry to it would be too slow.|
pg| ***** 148 ***** |


nt||at|zaXXon: What about the @sQ? 
If declarer has @cKQ, Jeff may have that card. 
Seeing this chance, Eric Rodwell promptly shifted to @sK !

(MM: This play even has a name: The "Deschapelles Coup"  
The lead of an unsupported high Honor in order to create an entry to partner's hand)|
pg| ***** 149 ***** |

This makes the prospects for defense not bright at all. 
Do you see a chance for 4 tricks at all? |

but he did not get the chance.
