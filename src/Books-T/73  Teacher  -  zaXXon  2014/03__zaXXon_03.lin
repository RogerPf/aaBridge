MM: The recommended screen resolution for .lin movies is 1440 x 900 pixels 
(rightclick on your desktop,select "personalize" "screen defenitions")
Also, make sure you have "widescreen" checked in your windows BBO-version
(If you're not sure about your settings log into your BBO windows version then:  
click the yellow tool at bottom and under the "general" tab check "widescreen" and save)
This will prevent the "cutting off" of the bottom parts or scrambling of your text in these presentations.

If you downloaded BBO recently, you will not be able to get online with the windows version...
You can still change or check your settings: 
Go to your C disc, and under "programs" find the Bridge Base Online folder
Open it and find the "profiles" folder
Open and scroll to find: BBO_Default_Settings 
line 71 should read: WIDE_CLIENT=1
If your setting is 0, change it to 1 and save. This will change your settings to "widescreen".

As an ALTERNATIVE: Open your aaBridge program and simply drag and drop the file of this presentation 
on the aaBridge screen.

fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2zaXXon: Welcome everybody.
Are you ready for some "guesses" again?

In previous lessons we have learnt to gather information from passed hands or opening hands. 
Both gave us important information, directing us to the right decisions. 
Let us remember, once the hand had passed, it's limited to about 11 points.
On the other hand, once it opens  1@d (for example), it promise about a 12 point minimum.

We could find similar information from opponent overcalls, or overcalls which are not made.
Usually, if an opponent bids 1@h over our 1@c, we expect 5+ cards in that suit and a minimum of 8-9 points. 
But if he passed and later shows a good 5-card suit, we have to remember he did not have points enough to open. 



LadyStar17:  @D@D Join Zaxxon on Fridays at 4 PM EDT for a six board free tourney. 
Zaxxon will host this tourney and make rounds of the tables and comment and answer questions. 
It will be an exciting afternoon. Check tournament listings on Friday @H@H

MM: Many thanks to David (Major_blue) for saving the hands and editing the chat for this presentation!

We see partner was optimistic, just as we were. Can we count some tricks?
...or some range of possibilities.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |

Looking first at spades - 1 or 2 tricks. The hand is very complicated and we could take between 6 and 10 tricks.
As declarer, with which suits should we start?
It seems one suit alone is not enough to generate the required tricks...
Let's see what happens in spades first |

Where can we find trick 9 ?
Well, there are 2 finesses we could take: 
run the @cQ or finesse @d10,  and one is more likely to work than the other....|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||at|We can't lose more tricks, having  already lost 4, but we have already seen many high cards:
@sAQxx, @hKJx, @dK...all of them in East
If East has the @cK as well, he could have overcalled 1NT over partner's 1@h opening. 
He would have 16 points, a balanced hand and 2 @h stoppers. |

up|38|pf|y|at|zaXXon: And the rest is easy. At trick 9 we win @DJ and lead @CQ, playing West for @CK.

So the lesson is you should notice high-cards. Another important piece of advice:
Do not think in these lines: 
"my right hand opponent showed too much, therefore I will look for that Queen on my left", but rather,
"he showed 10 points and passed"...or "he has 14, one more Queen and he would have opened 1NT".|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt||at|
If you have 33 points and playing 6NT, then any overcall will surely have announced all 7 missing points.
If you have 27, however, and your LHO has initially passed, he can't have all 13 :)

MM: You can play the hand Double dummy if you wish by clicking on the cards. The lead was the @s5.

or
b) we take the @d finesse into the dangerous hand. 
Are there any clues?
Well, first - how do you think the spades split,  4-4 or 5-3 ?
|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt||at|We can't be sure, but 5-3 is more likely.  
If 4-4 we can play @h safely.
If west has 5,   @sKQ108x,  can he have the @hAce also?|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


at|
Would he pass over 1@c, not vulnerable?|

All this makes it more likely that the @hA is with East, in case there is a 5-3 spades.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt||at|
I suppose most of you would like to cash clubs first.  
(Often this would help. A tired West might throw a spade.) 
Moreover, we have enough to discard – we would not squeeze ourselves.|

Once again we should check the chances:
If we play on diamonds, we make it 50% of the time. 
If we play on hearts we go down if @s are 5-3 and West has Ace. 
But this is very unlikely, as a 1@s overcall did not happen.

pc|H4|at|zaXXon: You may not like the bidding... More important is to like the contract  
and most important is to like the result... :)
Let's plan the hand.
Assuming @sK is good, we have to give 1@s, 1@c and 1-2 @d's.  
We can discard a @d on the 4th @c which doesn't save the guess at all with regard to the @D finesse.
In view of the last hands, how should we play @d's? Where is the @DAce?

at| 
but Jack looks more likely....
1st - because of the 1@s overcall
2nd, east could probably find some bid with 2 aces and a @s fit (don't forget east showed the @cAce already). 
So, since overcalls promise some points we are lead to deduce that West has the @DA and at trick 9 we put up the @DJ.

pc|SK|at|We are too strong for 1NT and open 1@d.  
True, the spade stopper is only one, but 2NT looks just fine.  Dummy is fine too.
Let's do a quick count. 
Don't forget that if either opponent gets the lead they would be ready to cash spades, as we can holdup only once.
So - we can count 3 @h's, only if we find the Queen.
The count is  1 @S,  2 @H's,  3 @D's  and potentially  2 @C's.|

As mentioned, watch out for overcalls from passed hands, they tell much.|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


at|
We saw the @sKQ(J) and a @dJ with West.  With the @cAce he could open 1@S.
Without the @cAce, he is more likely to overcall WITH the @hQ.

at|zaXXon: And, if you think "he bid 1@s just to tell us where the queen is..."  
I will tell you  - no, he bids 1@s before  knowing that 3NT will be the final contract and what South's problem will be.
So you see, the information is everywhere.
