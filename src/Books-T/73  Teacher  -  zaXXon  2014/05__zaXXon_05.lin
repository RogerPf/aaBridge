MM: The recommended screen resolution for .lin movies is 1440 x 900 pixels 
(rightclick on your desktop,select "personalize" "screen defenitions")
Also, make sure you have "widescreen" checked in your windows BBO-version
(If you're not sure about your settings log into your BBO windows version then:  
click the yellow tool at bottom and under the "general" tab check "widescreen" and save)
This will prevent the "cutting off" of the bottom parts or scrambling of your text in these presentations.

If you downloaded BBO recently, you will not be able to get online with the windows version...
You can still change or check your settings: 
Go to your C disc, and under "programs" find the Bridge Base Online folder
Open it and find the "profiles" folder
Open and scroll to find: BBO_Default_Settings 
line 71 should read: WIDE_CLIENT=1
If your setting is 0, change it to 1 and save. This will change your settings to "widescreen".

As an ALTERNATIVE: Open your aaBridge program and simply drag and drop the file of this presentation 
on the aaBridge screen.

^b@2zaXXon:  Welcome people.  It's nice to see you here again.

Today we will continue our efforts to investigate the opponent's hands in the way to take the right decisions.  
Last week we started the discussion on a new variation of hands.   

There are many hands, where we have to mix real information (which we see) ...
with specific conditions, given from current hand or single suit (what we need).   

A summary of both factors create a picture and our plan should follow it accordingly.


This mix is not easy...
Let's go!



LadyStar17:  @D@D Join Zaxxon on Fridays at 4 PM EDT for a six board free tourney. 
Zaxxon will host this tourney and make rounds of the tables and comment and answer questions. 
It will be an exciting afternoon. Check tournament listings on Friday @H@H

MM: Many thanks to David (Major_blue) for saving the hands and editing the chat for this presentation!

pc|dt|at|zaXXon: It's hard to bid creatively over opposition's  1NT, so let us jump aggressively to 4@s   
Lucky, it went without a double. 
Even better, we have escaped @c lead.  
Do you think we have a chance?|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|
I hear you saying it depends on location of @S honors,  also the @CA. 
This quite correct.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||at|We should have no doubts where the @c Ace is. 
If we assume East has 15 then West can only have 3 points, maximum. 
So two @c losers are pretty sure. 
We have to take trumps with one loss only, and West can not have any aces. 
There is only one entry to the dummy hand :(
Let's play off @DAK and perhaps the Q will drop, promoting our @DJ ?

How should we play trumps when East plays low?
What card do we play from the South hand?
Yes, @SK. 
We know it will win, but playing @SJ would lose if West has @SQ. 
If we have to play this suit alone, without clues, we should start with small to Jack!
But the clues told us that West did not have @SAce.|

up|20|pf|y|at|zaXXon: :)
If the NT opener has @sAQx, - we can't prevent losing 2 tricks when East ducks the first Spade.  
- This is the mix of clues, which was mentioned earlier.
Firstly, a condition we ^*bneeded^*n - spades 2-2. 
We hope for this and play accordingly.
Secondly, information we ^*bhave^*n - the Ace is with East
As a result - winning play small to the King|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt||at|...if there is winning play at all :)
Let me emphasise, that playing @sK we can't lose that trick. We can only win.
Playing @sK is wrong only when West has singleton A or Ax

MM: You can play the hand Double dummy if you wish by clicking on the cards. The lead was the @d10.

8 ever, 9 never for the spades?
Spade finesse?  We have a 2-way finesse, and we want to play it in the right direction as we have a choice...|

btour:  If east has the @HK he probably does not have @sQ
zaXXon: Some of you are working this out well.  
Ok, as you said, we can lose 1 more only.... and we almost sure have to give @c!
Thus, heart finesse to work is mandatory!
There is a correct line.  First to check @c for miracle (doubleton QJ)

We cannot check @h finesse now before playing trumps, because we do not have the entry to dummy's hand.
Now we have to apply the condition: we ^*bNEED^*n @HK on the right.
Once we decide we need it, we trust it is there.

Not every time you can divide the points so clearly, but when you can, you have to use it.

We placed @cA (from the biding)
We needed @hK on hook.
Which gave us @d position as well|

Don't think this will work every time.
