MM: The recommended screen resolution for .lin movies is 1440 x 900 pixels 
(rightclick on your desktop,select "personalize" "screen defenitions")
Also, make sure you have "widescreen" checked in your windows BBO-version
(If you're not sure about your settings log into your BBO windows version then:  
click the yellow tool at bottom and under the "general" tab check "widescreen" and save)
This will prevent the "cutting off" of the bottom parts or scrambling of your text in these presentations.

If you downloaded BBO recently, you will not be able to get online with the windows version...
You can still change or check your settings: 
Go to your C disc, and under "programs" find the Bridge Base Online folder
Open it and find the "profiles" folder
Open and scroll to find: BBO_Default_Settings 
line 71 should read: WIDE_CLIENT=1
If your setting is 0, change it to 1 and save. This will change your settings to "widescreen".

As an ALTERNATIVE: Open your aaBridge program and simply drag and drop the file of this presentation 
on the aaBridge screen.

fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2zaXXon: As you are here today, I suppose you liked our first meeting :)

Bridge is a game of decisions. 
Sometimes we have to flip a coin, play the K or the J?
Sometimes it looks like a 50/50 to find the queen, but eventually we choose one and succeed...
Sometimes we have to finesse, but we play for the drop 
(or vice versa, sometimes we "should" play for the drop, but we decide to finesse). 
Why?
We should have strong reasons to decide against the percentage play.

Making right decisions is science. 
We search for information, we apply it to the deal and we play all suits accordingly.
The information is coming from the bidding and play. For example, if:

A) A player originally passed - his hand is limited to 10-11 HCP
or
B) A player has opened 1@c/@d/@h/@s - his hand contains at least 11 HCP
and so on

Last Tuesday we started with some hands of type A) and we'll look at a few more today


LadyStar17:  @D@D Join Zaxxon on Fridays at 4 PM EDT for a six board free tourney. 
Zaxxon will host this tourney and make rounds of the tables and comment and answer questions. 
It will be an exciting afternoon. Check tournament listings on Friday @H@H

:) could be right
So, sure losers are 3 - a  @c + 2 @d's
If we draw trumps, we could claim 10 tricks.
With 9 trumps, the hope is to cash AK and drop the Q.
Can we increase our chances?  Let's see.|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


nt||pc|H5|pc|H2|pc|HJ|at|zaXXon: It appears that the @hQ is with opener.
How many points do we have in both hands?
24. 
The opponents have 16. Can we expect some honor cards in East?
We can't investigate this time, because a @d ruff is possible.
All missing honors:  @sQ,  @hQ,  @dAK,  @cAJ|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


nt||at|The @h10 was not a very promising lead against 4@s from Q109xx...
With the @dAK, west should have lead from that suit, ..... Therefore the A or K should be in east....
giving east a minimum of 3 points, and west 13.
But if east ALSO has the @sQ that would give west only 11
so that strongly suggests the  @sQ in west and we can finesse west for the Q!
