Barbara started teaching bridge in 1976. For many years, she and her husband Alex Kornel owned the Kate Buckman Bridge Studio (the largest bridge club in Canada and the fourth largest on the continent).  
In 2006, it was named by ACBL as the top Bridge Club in North America. 
Barbara and Alex now own and run a School of Bridge in Toronto as well as a bridge club.

lb|*cWhat should Declarer do next?^^C7,c6,c4^SKJ97DQJ75C764|at|bseagram: Here is the story
Declarer counts losers in her hand
Looking to dummy to see how dummy can help with losers with high cards.
NO @s-losers, No @h-losers (Ace in dummy = 0), NO @d-losers and THREE, that is THREEEEEEEE Club losers|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|
With 3 @C-losers, that is three too many.   You have to plan to ruff these in dummy.
In order to do that, we cannot pull ANY TRUMP first or we will not have enough  trump in dummy with which to trump all 
those dreadful little club losers |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||at|
bseagram: Before you start though, it is essential that we recognize that this is NOT a hand for a cross ruff.
A cross ruff takes place ONLY when we do NOT have a hand with LOADS of winners in a SIDE SUIT (non-trump suit)
If you cross ruff a hand, then you pull no trump.  
If you pull no trump, then the bad guys will trump your magnificent diamonds. Shame 
Win @hA and lead a @C to your Ace and trump a @C. |

side suit in Diamonds.  
You HAVE to be able to pull trump   AFTER ruffing your Clubs
sblitz:  How decide at trick 2 whether to trump @c's in dummy or trump @h's in hand?  Need to find balanced split
bseagram:  ALWAYS gain tricks by trumping losers from declarer's hand with dummy's trumps. ALWAYS|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram:  ALWAYS right to ruff in DUMMY
sblitz:  Even if trumps are equally split?
bseagram:  If @D divide badly, unlucky. In which case it was right to ruff a @H in hand and pray for a 3-2 split in trump
The way we did it, we still made it if trumps broke 4-1|

up|52|pf|y|at|bseagram: veeree, you played that really well! 
At the halfway point, however you drew a round of trump.
I would suggest not doing that. You were REALLY lucky and your opponents' trumps broke 2-2. 
Odds are not high that this will happen (40.7%).
Just plan to keep cross ruffing|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram: On this hand, veeree had a singleton in each hand and NO OTHER LONG GOOD SOLID suit, 
this hand is a Cross ruff.
Do not pull any trump at all but Cross ruff the entire hand.
veeree had FOUR club losers and had to ruff them all in dummy. (yes, a club sets up with a 4-3 split)
|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt||at|Holden47:  If I led out trumps rather than @sK would this have made a difference?
bseagram:  Yes, leading trumps would have made a difference, BUT you did not know to do this
It is hard to know when to do this.
kw2012:  If a trump had been lead then she would need to play it the way she did hoping for the club 4-3 split?
bseagram:  YES, that is correct.|

up|51|at|bseagram: Everyone look at the hand now
When you are playing a hand on a cross ruff,
IF you have side suit winners like JUST an Ace and a King, NOT a whole solid suit of AKQJ
You have to cash the side suit winners first.
Otherwise, west when he runs out of Clubs...will pitch a heart and ruff a @h later 
(as you have not been able to pull any trump)|

So if you are going to do a cross ruff, you MUST look to see if you have a side suit Ace and King...
cash them before embarking on the cross ruff..
if not, opponents will get to ruff the good cards later and that is depressing.

We use up so much energy with all that negativity ...instead of focusing on how on earth am I going to MAKE this hand.
I almost think that some are so annoyed with the contract that they try to make sure they do NOT make it!

The 4-4 fit is the VERY best.
When you have a choice of playing a hand on a 4-4 fit or a 5-3 fit, no contest !

Count losers|

lc|hahqhjh6h4c7c6|nt||lb|*mHow many losers do you count?^1~2~3~4~5^4|at|bseagram:  You have TWO diamond losers and TWO club losers.
You can throw away the clubs on the long hearts in dummy after pulling trump, 
but you have a singelton @D in dummy so you can trump TWO diamond losers in dummy, before pulling all the trump.

Let's go back and see what went wrong for defense...

pg| ***** 159 ***** |

up|29|pf|y|at|bseagram:  chase1340, you had him at trick one!
RULE...when you are defending and you have 4 trump, keep leading your long good suit!
When you have a long good suit and DUMMY DOES have some of that suit, keep leading that suit and make declarer trump 
in his hand. 
This is VERY sound strategy.
It is called FORCING defense, making declarer ruff in his hand is an evil, ugly, mean, nasty thing to do
....which is GOOD for your side.|
pg| ***** 160 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram:  It depletes declarer's supply of trump in his hand.
Declarer's hand is called the LONG hand because he is the one with the most trump usually.
We want to make him trump in the long hand,
then you will end up with more trump than he has (cuz you have 4 trump)        vicious
Let's do it over...NS leading diamonds at EVERY opportunity|

bseagram:  Thank you one and all for coming.

Review:
If you are thinking that a hand should be X ruffed, make sure you do NOT have a long great side suit, like AKQJ...
that cannot ever be a X ruff hand...as you have to be able to pull trump.
It is more likely a RUFF IN DUMMY hand|
pg| ***** 175 ***** |


at|
If you have a hand that is a X ruff, do not pull trump, but DO cash winners in side suits first|
pg| ***** 176 ***** |


at|
Also, play hands on 4-4 fit vs 5-3 fit if you have a choice
and finally|
pg| ***** 177 ***** |


at|         If you have 4 trump, lead your longest other suit and make declarer ruff in her hand
