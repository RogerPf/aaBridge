up|41|pf|y|sk||at|bseagram:  OK, then let us count losers in North hand
We count losers in declarer's hand as that is the hand that usually has the most trump|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


at|
0@s losers, no @h-losers,|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


at|    2@d losers|hc|d8d3|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


at|   and 2 @c losers|hc|cqc8|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


at|
4 losers altogether and we are only allowed 3...agree?
We would love to be able to ruff (trump) in dummy but we have 2 @C's opposite 2 clubs and 3 @D's opposite 3 diamonds
so we have to look for an alternative plan|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


lc|cqc8d8d3|nt||at|When partner lays down a 5 card suit in dummy, we are supposed to say a great big "THANK YOU, PARTNER!"
5 card suits in dummy are to die for, they can be developed.
5 Spades in dummy and 2 in declarer's hand
7 cards altogether. You are missing 6
They will break 4-2 most of the time.|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram:  When you are missing an even number of cards in a suit
they will break badly
An odd number they will break favourably
i.e. missing 6, they should break 4-2 most of the time. Missing 5, they should break 3-2.
So if the Spades will probably divide 4-2 then the FIFTH card in dummy can be made to be high
And on that 5th card you will  plan to discard one of your losers from declarer's hand|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt||at|So you  have to ruff @s until they are good
On this particular hand, you are lucky spades divide 3-3 but not normally so.
The only way to get back to dummy over and over again is by using the trumps suit 
so you cannot afford to draw trumps just yet. You must attack spades right away|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt||at|So, after winning the @dAce (west plays the 7, encouraging), play 2 rounds of spades.
Follow with the @s6 and ruff with the @h8, never send a boy to do a man's job
(If spades are 4-2, east might "overruff" the 6 with her 7! => ruff with @h8)

(MM: you can click on the cards as suggested, following Barbara's notes)|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram:  Ok, now look at this
If we play to the @hAce now in dummy, we will not be able to get back there later to "enjoy" playing the high spades
So you have to play to the @h9 and KEEP the @hAce as an entry to dummy AFTER pulling THREE rounds of trump
You want to play THREE rounds of trump ENDING in dummy.
Finally the high spades pitching loser(s)
Because you were super lucky and the spades divided 3-3 you even make an overtrick|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt||at|Long suit establishment is fabulous. Just takes more guts because you usually cannot pull trumps right away as you need the trumps as entries to dummy.

MM: You can play the hand Double dummy if you wish by clicking on the cards
to undo plays use the ^$6 button

East is the opening leader

up|52|sk||pf|y|at|bseagram:  Perfect!
Let's have a look at the hand in full for a bit. 
So let us count losers, focus on EAST hand|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


hc|s2|at|
1 spade loser,|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


hc|d7d4|at|   2 diamond losers|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


hc|c3|at|    and 1 club loser|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


at|
Does EVERYONE count their losers before playing a hand in a trump suit? 
Ok, good|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


lc|s2d7d4c3|nt||at|bseagram:  If you don't make a plan, you won't make your contract
You are frantic for one extra trick on this hand
@s's are 2-2, @C's are 3-3 in declarer and dummy's hands
So the only hope is a long suit in dummy|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


nt||hc|d9d8d5d3d2|at|bseagram:  That is a very ugly suit
diamonds look pathetic|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


at|
But they are yours to love and nurture and develop
Ugly as they are, they are like your children. 
If your children were ugly you would still love them so you have to love the diamonds|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


lc|d9d8d5d3d2|nt||at|bseagram:  So you have to get to work on the wretched diamonds right now
Win ace spades and lead a diamond and give away that dimaond to charity
Opponents must not lead diamonds themselves or it is helpful
You see, each side has a project suit|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram:  Declarer's project is diamonds
Opponents primary project suit is spades until dummy runs out of spades
Then oppoenents will lead their next best suit (sequences are best of all) clubs
On the lead of the @sQ, north should play his 6 (and not the 3)
When partner leads the @cJ, play the 7 (and not the 2)
N must show that he has an honor that is equal to the one that South has led.|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


nt||at|Note that Karen won @C in hand as she needs entries to dummy (@cK)
S leads @c10  as N has said they LOVE Clubs
Karen is attacking diamonds like a pitbull with a bone
Never let up till you have finished your project
Keeping @hK in dummy (she expects @h to divide 3-1)|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


nt||at|So plays three rounds of trump ENDING IN DUMMY
Playing 13th diamond and pitching a loser on it
sblitz:  Wouldn't a @c lead, and continuing @c's (as NS project suit), have set this contract?
bseagram:  No, @C lead would not set contract as declarer would still have possession of ace spades in that case and could pitch a Spade instead|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


nt||at|EddyHaskel: What if south leads trumps twice to take away one of dummy's entries?
Karen10: @h6 still an entry (because @h break well here)
Isabelle10:  How do you get to 20 in East, with 3 extra and 15 HCP
bseagram:  If you are a long suit counter you have 2 extra pts for length 
...you must ALWAYS count distribution no matter what ANYONE says
unless you are playing in NT|
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


nt||at|Thus you had 17 points
(short suit counters also have 17)
Isabelle10:  so you double count them in effect
bseagram:  When partner supports your suit, you now get 1 extra point for the 5 th card in the suit that has been supported and 1 extra point for EACH REMAINING card = now 20
Yes double count sort of|
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


nt||at|If you do not revalue you will not get to your slams and games
It is the problem most players have
Your points are not carved in stone
Your hand is rather like a flower ...it always blossoms and grows or it wilts and dies when partner bids
Revaluing is MOST important|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


nt||at|realrowdy:  I agree   just have trouble remembering to do it
bseagram:  Take Ginko Biloba...good for memory. Then all you have to do is remember to take it

mm: You can play the hand DD following Barbara's suggestions.
You may also check different defense suggestions. South has the opening lead.

You are allowed to lose 1 trick in 6, I would have just bid 6@H anyway.
sebstar: I'm a bit of a chicken - with all those rag spades
bseagram:  So if you don't care what partner responds and there is no hope of 7 on a hand, then just bid 6 versus asking about aces. 
Yes you are a bit worried about one suit|
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram:  But with ^*bpre empts^*n it is all about ^*btricks versus points^*n

So if you have the 2 tricks she says she is going down, you pass|

up|52|pf|y|sk||at|bseagram:  Excellent
7@S was a bit pushy but close enough
There was one small detail:
When the third round of hearts is played by declarer from dummy
msphola (south) should not ruff
All very tempting as it seems as though this is your chance to ruff!! and beat them|
pg| ***** 139 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram:  Declarer is not behaving like a person that has the @hQ though
If west had owned the @hQ, she would have first pulled trump and then played hearts
As she would know that one of NS would be ruffing her third round of Hearts
Thus S knows that NORTH must own the @hQ|
pg| ***** 140 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram:  Thus must not ruff 
It is a waste of your trump and as bad as trumping partner's Ace
It did not matter on this hand but often it will matter|
pg| ***** 141 ***** |


nt||at|msmaple:  Which do you prefer Barbara, @D waiting or steps?
bseagram:  I strongly prefer 2@D as waiting, not steps
I like the strong hand to be declarer whenever possible

I will have to bring along tougher hands next time! cuz these guys are all WAY TOO GOOD|

South has shown extras...If he had 7 points only, he would have jumped to 4@S after 3@H
thus he has extra values
Thus you, north should now be aroused       Revalue your hand
Partner has 10-12 points

mb|p|sk|n|mb|5s|at|bseagram:  Key Card Blackwood was invented to stop you from getting to 6 missing TWO key cards
And to stop you from getting to 7 missing one key card
It is fine to lose ONE trick in 6.
So bid 6@S next after 5@D by South|
pg| ***** 155 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram:  4NT is always better unless you have a REASON to not bid 4NT
Such as a void as you may not use blackwood with a void
OR if you have two or three small cards in a side suit. That is another time to not use Blackwood

up|52|pc|dq|at|bseagram:  OK, that was a tough one. Let's look it over
The problem came at trick one
You won @dAce at trick one and then played the @dK at trick two (or ace) 
You now had an oppoirtunity (rare) to make a discard. Make it one that will help your life
What people have trouble with is deciding how many losers they have on this hand
Everyone...focus on North. They have FIVE HEART LOSERS|
pg| ***** 174 ***** |


nt||at|FIVE
There are NO guarantees that ANY of those hearts will win ANY tricks so we have to call them LOSERS
Thus we have to pitch a heart on the high @D
Then we get to work on clubs
When you pitched a @C (which was NOT a loser) on Diamond in dummy you lost all communication with dummy|
pg| ***** 175 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram:  Replay and I will call cards

MM: Barbara guided declarer and defense, but after reloading again, you will be able to play this hand Double Dummy
For now, let's watch the correct line|

up|52|pf|y|at|bseagram:  Santa when you got on lead earlier, 
there was no rush to play your @hAce as there was nowhere for declarer to throw away her hearts in her hand. 
Best to keep making her ruff in her hand
Always good technique to deplete her supply of trumps
It is the cruelest dirtiest, nastiest form of defense|

To hurt , maim and destroy

Tougher than all the others, honestly|

So you must give it away first, KEEPING the ace diamonds in dummy as an entry

Keeping the pictures in the hand that you will later have to get to
High cards I mean|
