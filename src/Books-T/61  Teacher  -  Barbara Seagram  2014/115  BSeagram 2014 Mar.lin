When I use CAPS everyone, it is only to emphasize. Many in cyberspace deem that to be shouting. I am NOT shouting!!!

Dbl is the only bid North can make and then bid his suit later to show 18 or more points
Just dbl first and then bid spades. It is called the big overcall or the big double
Otherwise your hand is limited to 17 pts.|

pc|DQ|at|bseagram:  N must count his losers: 
1 @s loser, 1 potential @h loser,  2 @d losers and   0 @c losers
That is 4 losers. 1 too many
N must recognize the need to finesse West for @hK. How on earth will he get to dummy to finesse?
|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt||pc|D6|pc|H6|lb|*cWhich card should north play?^^s7^SKQJ9875HAQCAKD|pc|S5|at|bseagram:  The @s6 will provide an entry (provided you ruff with the @s7)
If you have limited (or NO!!) entries to dummy, very often the trump suit will provide an entry or two.
So N must trump third diamond with  @s7 and not the @s5
Declarer can then draw all trump and get to dummy with @s5 to dummy's @s6 and do the @H finesse.

pc|H7|at|bseagram:  EAST, when you get in, it is always right to keep leading Diamonds and make declarer trump in her hand
VERSUS leading a heart. (brmac, you had help from a friendly opponent on this hand, you owe heelboy a drink!)
You can see that declarer has no entries to dummy in this pathetic dummy and therefore will not be able to take any finesses himself.
Every time you shift and lead a new suit as an opponent, you give declarer an extra trick|

East must slow down...plan the play count the losers
NO @S losers   No  @H losers   3 @D losers  and  2 @C losers
Spades are SOLID missing the J. 
You really do not care about the J except that you cannot get to the fantastic @hAKQ in dummy.
So you have to give away a Spade in order to get to dummy's @s10 or 9  and that will be an entry to dummy's hearts.

up|52|pf|y|at|bseagram:  Failure to communicate in this case again means how on earth do we get to dummy...
Not failure to communicate with our spouse or good friend
Eddie Kantar tells the story of teaching a lady and he said to her   "How will you get over to the dummy?" 
So she got up from the table and walked over to the dummy side and that way she "got there"
Glad you did a re-do and figured it out
Hard to give away a spade trick when you own AKQ trumps and gazillions of them|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram:  S, when you get on lead, your project suit was clubs and you should keep slugging with Clubs
vs leading a spade.
brmac: If S as second hand had continued to play low on second trick would they have defeated declarer?
bseagram:  No, that does not defeat declarer, because if S ducks @sJ spades, then declarer is in dummy with high spade and can now pitch diamonds.|

Better to blackwood when you can, no reason to cuebid
B'wood is better unless you have a reason to not B'wood
If you cannot bid BLW, (because you have a void or 2 or 3 litlle cards in a side (non-trump) suit) 
=> then you cue bid first round controls.
4NT is a better way of discovering everything than cuebidding.

and West (who has promised 6-9 points) has 9 versus 6 , accepts the invitation and bids 3.
We call 2NT  the singles bar bid....an invitation to go further!!!

pf|y|up|38|at|bseagram:  Did everyone see what poor Kanga was forced to do???
Lola8888:  She had to take with that @sJ and save the little trump in her hand, to get to the dummy twice to finesse
bseagram:  Yes, ruff high and keep two small trump to get to dummy twice
Need TWO entries to dummy to do @H finesse twice so have to finesse for the @s9 and pray
It is all about the plan at trick one

sk|w|mb|4hppp|at|bseagram:  from 2@H to 4@H says : I have CRUD, but support for @H
ecolodge:  Question:  I would probably be confused with the 4@H bid by W.  Case for bidding 3@C bust hand?
bseagram:  Re bust hand. I would bid 2nd negative 3@C if I had NO support for partner
When partner opens 2@C and then bids a suit, he does not need a partner...
he has game in his own hand it it merely a question of game only or slam.
The jump to 4 says..."this is really pathetic but I have trump support"
ecolodge:  ok.  and 2@C opener would know that it is always close-out?
bseagram:  It is a close out, yes, unless opener has  more than the world fair

pc|CQ|at|bseagram:  South leads A, then K then Q of Clubs
heelboy has 2 spade losers, no heart losers, no diamond losers, 2 club losers
4 losers = 1 too many
Declarer looks at dummy in desperation. there is only one good card over there   the @dQ
Only good cuz E has Ace and King diamonds
How on earth can we ever get to dummy?
When you are short on entries to dummy, stop and think if trump suit can provide you with an entry to dummy

nt||pc|C8|pc|CT|pc|S3|at|bseagram:  On 3rd round of clubs, you ruff with anything but the @h8 
Draw 2 rounds of trump. Play @dAK and now small @h to 9 in dummy. 
Play @dQ and pitch a spade
|
pg| ***** 151 ***** |


nt||at|bseagram:  YES, always good for South to lead third round club. 
EVERY TIME you shift to a new suit, it helps declarer. 
LEAD same suit and make declarer ruff in his hand. It is cruel and good defence. |
