^d @H@2Lioncub's bidding session is held every Friday in the BIL at noon NY time. 3 Hands @e@3are bid with 4 volunteers and then change. Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play.......or both. Feel free to ask any questions that are bridge related.

^d @H@2What  :|CP||AT| For my later review I like to have a BBO movie representing lioncub's teaching session as close @e@3to the live event as possible. I am delighted that you can also enjoy it.|cp|8|at| 

How  :|CP||AT| In this presentation I have combined the hands from lioncub's Friday Teaching Sessions with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed and edited from the chat. He has approved the bridge information in this movie. You will see the four hands and the auction by the participants and after Allan has asked for a "Lead and Claim." The claim is meaningless and is made so his critique can begin. |cp|8|at| 

Goal :|CP||AT| The emphasis is to present lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  Incorrect grammar and spelling are tolerated. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. All the links in this file are clickable - they turn color when you move your cursor over them.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site. |FP|2|AT|

The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at|^*B HELP^*N |cp||FP|2|at|box at the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section. |FP||CP|8|AT|
 

Please help me improve these movies by sending suggestions to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.|CP||FP||AT|

                                               
                                              Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

lioncub: Good lead. We had very good bidding up to the 3@S bid.  
W could have doubled 1@S. 
3@S was also good. BUT the quality of the spade suit.......should deter South from bidding on.|

lioncub: Excellent lead. I will start by giving you my bidding and then explain it.
^C1@C-1@S
^C3@S-4NT
^C5@S-6@S |
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


NT|
We play bidding all 4-card suits up the line and forcing to 1NT. Therefore no need to jump to 2@S with such an anaemic suit. 1@S is forcing. Once N bids spades that becomes agreed suit and S can add distribution points. 3 for singleton and 1 for doubleton makes 13+3+1=16. Now, N just needs to check on aces to see if it is 6 or 7. North shoould settle for 6@S after finding out that partner has 2 key cards and the Q of trumps and that an ace is missing.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


NT||NT|
lioncub: In the actual sequence,,,,,,,,,,S bid well to splinter in hearts agreeing spades. Note this can be nothing other than a splinter.  With a genuine heart suit he would have bid 3@H.   6@H was obviously a misunderstanding. The key to the bidding is to remember to bid all suits up the line, and forcing to 1NT. For more on Splinter please visit my site at ^*Hwww.zyworld.com/lioncub/Splinter_Bids.htm^*N |

lioncub: If you going to lead a heart,,,,,,,,,lead top of interior sequence..........the 9. Over 1NT, E needs to investigate which is the best contract 3NT or 4@S. So bid 2@C. This is the NMF. Partner will bid NT with just 2 spades.........or bid 2@S with any 3-card spade suit or a doubleton honour. |
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT|
So the bidding should be:
^C1@D-1@S
^C1NT-2@C
^C2@S-3NT
The 3NT bid is saying..........partner with 3 spades bid 4@S, otherwise pass 3NT. And of course now W passes 3NT. |

lioncub: NEVER LEAD FROM KINGS OR TENACES WHEN SITTING OVER THE STRONG HAND. LEAD A MINOR SUIT.  3@C by E is the correct bid looking for spade fit. If not will play in 3NT. Note 3NT is hopeless. South holds up the ace of clubs for one round. Now lets look at puppet stayman. Here 2NT rebid shows a balanced hand with 22/23 points. 3@C is puppet stayman asks partner to bid a 5-card major then would bid 3@H or 3@S. The response to 3@C is 3@D. This shows one (or 2) 4-card major. Now E will bid the suit in WHICH HE DOES NOT HOLD 4-CARDS enabling the strong hand to play the contract. |
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT|
The bidding after 2NT followed by 3@C would be:
^C3@D-3@H
^C3@S-4@S

lioncub: Good suit to lead. BUT lead the 2. Another big tip. Reserve the strong jump shift for hands containing a very good 6-card suit and 17+ points. There is  plenty of room to explore with a 1@D response..........forcing of course. The bidding should be: 
^C1@C-1@D
^C1@S-2@H (4SF) ( visit ^*Hwww.zyworld.com/lioncub/Fourth_Suit_Forcing.htm^*N for more in 4SF)
^C3@C-3NT|

lioncub: Correct lead. Opening bid does not satisfy rule of 20. 2@D overcall is fine..........note the 6-card suit.
N bid is NOT 2@H. The hand is too strong. My preferred bid is double, showing the points.......and the 4-card spade suit. E has 10 points with support for partner. Make the cue bid (3@H) to show this. Now S  having opened sub minimum................must not make another bid.|

lioncub: Lead of singleton is good.  Bidding  is fine up to 5NT. Please pay attention, this bid is asking for specific kings. With
one then bid that particular king at 6 level. With 2 bid 6NT. Here, you have the King of hearts and the king of clubs
PLUS second round control in diamonds. So bid 7. Spade king you ignore. That is why I say that S should bid the grand slam. It was complete guessing for N to bid 7. 3@S was an excellent bid. As I said all bidding was great up to the 5NT bid.|

lioncub: Lead suit agreed upon. The lead should be the 3@S. Now to the bidding.
^C1@D-2@C  The 2@C is a bit light for 2 level bid. BUT with good 6-card suit give it a go. 3@C shows min hand. With 18 points 3NT is the Only one bid now for W to make. Whether it makes or not............that is the bid.|

lioncub: Good lead. Now let us look at he bidding.
^C1@D-1@S
^C1NT     This 1NT bid shows a balanced hand with 12-14 points and denies 4 spades. Therefore Pam, you should be able to tell that there is no slam, only best game. Great bid of 2@C........again a NMF hand to find out if partner has 3 spades...or doubleton honour. After the 2@S bid just bid 4@S.|

lioncub: Lead is the top of interior sequence the J@S. Fine bidding. Please note hand evaluation of W. That QJ98...........is worth one more point. So 16HCP+1=17. BUT, as I said to Ally the other day.............the operation was successful but the patient died. 3NT is down.|
