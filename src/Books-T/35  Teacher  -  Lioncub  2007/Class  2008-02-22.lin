^d @H@2Lioncub's bidding session is held every Friday in the BIL at noon NY time. 3 Hands @e@3are bid with 4 volunteers and then change. Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play.......or both. Feel free to ask any questions that are bridge related.

^d @H@2What  :|CP||AT| For my later review I like to have a BBO movie representing lioncub's teaching session as close @e@3to the live event as possible. I am delighted that you can also enjoy it.|cp|8|at| 

How  :|CP||AT| In this presentation I have combined the hands from lioncub's Friday Teaching Sessions with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed and edited from the chat. He has approved the bridge information in this movie. You will see the four hands and the auction by the participants and after Allan has asked for a "Lead and Claim." The claim is meaningless and is made so his critique can begin. |cp|8|at| 

Goal :|CP||AT| The emphasis is to present lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  Incorrect grammar and spelling are tolerated. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. All the links in this file are clickable - they turn color when you move your cursor over them.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site. |FP|2|AT|

The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at|^*B HELP^*N |cp||FP|2|at|box at the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section. |FP||CP|8|AT|
 

Please help me improve these movies by sending suggestions to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.|CP||FP||AT|

                                               
                                              Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

^B@2lioncub: Lead the 8@C. The lowest of 3..........but the 9 is not so terrible.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: East opens 1@H. Now to the South. Is the hand worth bidding game or not? I don't think so. It is worth a 2@C bid and then double after 2NT to show the extra strength. That tells partner everything.........and it will be up to him to take  further action. 2@S bid by West is non-forcing. With no support for partner, I still would want to be in game in spades. So bid 4@S and let the opponents guess what to do next. |

lioncub: I approve of the 1@S bid. Note both opps bidding.........still good suit to bid at the one level. Now to W.  BIG TIP.............listen up. We play support doubles. W hears partner bid 1@H........can be made on just 4-card suit. So a double now shows EXACTLY 3-card support. The double says nothing about strength..........just shows the 3-card support and then reach superior contract of 4@H.|

lioncub: After 3@D from N..........South should be jumping up and down with excitement. This is looking very slammish. How to show interest in a slam. OVER A MINOR SUIT BID.........ANY BID THAT GOES PAST 3NT IS INTERESTED IN A SLAM. SO A BID OF 4@D over 3NT is such a bid. This allows N to sign off in 4NT........if not interested. |

Dianne0516: Why not 3 @s cueing after 3 @d--north should know it is cueing or would bid 1@s after 1@h?. |

^B@2lioncub: Good lead. Bidding was fine. Responder used Texas transfer. This is used when responder either because of shape or point count has no interest in slam. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


AT|
nome: Would it be correct to bid Texas transfer to set the trump suit and then bid 4NT when responder is confident that there is a slam?|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


AT|
lioncun: No. If interested in a slam then don't bid 4H. Bid 2H over 1NTand then bid 4S over 2S. That would show interest in a slam.|

^B@2lioncun: Lead is fine.  1@D was correct. 3@D can only be a VERY STRONG HAND WITH DIAMONDS........not weak. Therefore, North has to pass. And East, your partner opens and you have 11 poionts. You  must double. South, if not sure what partner has...........then take easy option and pass. My bidding:
1@D-p-1@H-p
1NT-2@D-?  
East now has problem. 3@C works best. The 3@C may not be the end of auction|

lioncub: Let me remind all of you of our basic system. Open lowest of suits and bid 4-card suits up the line ........forcing to 1NT. This stops the S hand of having to jump. 1@S would have still been forcing. Secondly.........please note............do NOT leave partner in a 4-3 fit. The rule is this for showing preference.........BID THE FIRST SUIT UNLESS HOLDING 2 CARDS OR MORE IN THE SECOND SUIT THAN YOU DO IN THE FIRST. |

^B@2lioncub: Mick missed a great chance to double the 3NT......for a spade lead. The lead in either case should be the Q@S. Double means lead dummies first bid suit. On the other hand  the final contract should be 3@C. S has nothing whatsoever to  spare.  3@C just showed a bit more.........in actual fact could have passed 2@C. |

lioncub: Super bidding. The only time you open 1@D with just 3-card suit is with 4/4/3/2 hand. Super protective double by North.  After opps have settled for a low part score in a minor..........partner is marked with a few points......so it is right to reopen with a double. |
