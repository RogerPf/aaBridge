^d @H@2Lioncub's bidding session is held every Friday in the BIL at noon NY time. 3 Hands @e@3are bid with 4 volunteers and then change. Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play.......or both. Feel free to ask any questions that are bridge related.|

^d @e@2In this presentation we have combined the movie of the hands from lioncub's Friday @e@3Teaching Session with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed version of chat log transcript.  

The emphasis is presenting to you lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  We did not focus on correctness of the grammar or the spelling.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. Clicking the first will move you forward and clicking the second will take you back. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. 

Further, all the links in this file are clickable - it turns blue when you move your cursor over it.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site.




Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

Now to the bidding. Which will score better? 1NT or 3@C?  I think this hand is better played in 1NT.  With 7 points opposite 15,,,,,,,,I would fancy my chances in 1NT  IRRESPECTIVE OF THE RESULT. |

lioncub: Amazing judgment from Kia. Transfer is definitely correct.  But look at those "soft values."  South has NOT got game values,,,,,,,,so invites. Note 3@S is invitational to 4@S and not to 3NT.  Game is made..........well done Nome. Very chancy invitational hand................but brownie points for being aggressive.

               Bid 3 of the major with under 7 points

Old York: if playing Bergen, can you still use trial bids after 1@S-2@S?|AT|
JanaDe: what is the advantage of Bergen over limit raises? |
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: 1@S-2@S in Bergen is showing 3-card support,  pre-emptive value.........and helps partner decide whether to go on or not. And yes you can use trial bids.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT|
KlutzyGirl: trial bids? |
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: good question Klutzy. Then  listen carefully.  You open 1@S........partner bids 2@S. Sooooooooooo after hearing 2@S you can pass..........or invite with 3S............or you have a nice hand with 3 small clubs losers. You bid the suit (clubs here) at the 3 level that specifically shows 3 losers  asking partner if he can take care of any of them. Partner bids 4@S  if he can. If not s/he signs off in 3@S. This  bid  is called a help suit game try. |
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|
KlutzyGirl: How do you distinguish between that and showing a 2nd good suit?  Is it just p-ship agreement?  |
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


AT|  lioncub: no just use the bid to show 3 losers............not to show another suit.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


AT| 
lioncub: In this sequence  and with the points N would not make  a try bid in clubs. |
PG| ***** 36 ***** |

PG| ***** 39 ***** |


AT| 
raf43: Doesn't the 1NT to @Ss and support for @hs by E call for a trump lead by N? |
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: Good point.  BIG TIP OF THE DAY. Never lead a trump from a holding of Jx or QX..........odds on partner will have the missing J or Q and declarer will then have no loser in the suit. |
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


mc|13|Nt|
lioncub: 1@S-1NT
              2@H............3@H  This is important.  W has shown 5 spades and 4 hearts and a hand under 17 points.  THIS IS NOT FORCING.........NOR INVITATIONAL  Therefore when E bids 3@H.........he MUST be showing upper range of his points. Hearing 3@H from partner.......which MUST be showing 4-card support.......then do a hand evaluation.  14 HCP + points for shape..........add 5 for the void =19. So W by any  means of counting...........remembering also that  ACES ARE GOLD AND KINGS ARE SILVER must bid game. 
Next board please.|

lioncub: Bad lead.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


mc|0|Nt|
lioncub: 1@H-???????????????? yerchhhhhhhhhhhhh. This is exactly the hand that you should never consider bidding 2@D. Suit much too poor.......and great defensive tricks in the other 3 suits and  meets none of my rules for an overcall........apart from having 6 cards. And worse is that partner should have led the ace of diamonds so setting up 2 discards.  I am slightly questioning my friend Jimmy's bid without wanting it to sound too critical. Further,  note W should support diamonds with Axx and an outside ace. 
Let us move on please.|

lioncub: overcall is fine................note the fine quality suit. North should double 2@D ...a negative double.  Geoff would then bid 3@C. However without any bid from partner he made a wise bid of PASS.  Why do I say that?  The key holding of 3 cards in opponent's suit.........WHICH IS THE WARNING SIGN NOT TO. |

3d|1|nt||bg|6|bt||cm|Y|mn|Bergen Raises|bt||nt||cm|n|cs|2|tu|1|ht|f|at|Bergen Raises apply when partner (playing 5-card majors) opens 1 of a major. The theory is that you want to bid to the level of the combined length of your trump suit, according to "The Law of Total Tricks". 

I.E. With 4-card support + partners 5-cards = 9 tricks = 3 level. With a weak hand and 4 trumps you can jump to the 3 level pre-emptively.
