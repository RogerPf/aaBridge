^d @e@2Lioncub's bidding session is held every Friday in the BIL at noon NY time. 3 Hands @e@3are bid with 4 volunteers and then change. Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play.......or both. Feel free to ask any questions that are bridge related.

^d @e@2In this presentation we have combined the movie of the hands from lioncub's Friday @e@3Teaching Session with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed version of the chat log transcript.  

The emphasis is presenting to you lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  We did not focus on correctness of the grammar or the spelling.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. Clicking the first will move you forward and clicking the second will take you back. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  Just run your cursor over it for the explanation. 

Further, all the links in this file are clickable - it turns blue when you move your cursor over it.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site.




Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

South has its double..........MIN OF AN OPENING BID.....WITH LESS WOULD PASS. North has no 4-card major ..BUT knowing partner has min of a GOOD OPENING BID...should bid 3NT which will make. Always trust your partner to have his bid. That is what disciplined bidding is all about. 

Kib: what would South need to overcall instead of double? lioncub: 5-card suit.
lioncub: Lead & claim.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


pc|DA|mc|13|nt|lioncub: Lead should be a small diamond and NOT the ace. By giving up an early trick ( a trick  that must be lost) - -you retain communication.........That is assuming partner had a doubleton in the suit. |

This is the way to show 3-card support and 10-12 points. A jump to 3@S with first bid would show 4-card support. And West does well to pass with min hand, and nothing to spare. 
lioncub: Lead & claim.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


pc|H5|mc|0|nt|lioncub: lead is wrong. Correct suit..BUT...never underlead an ace. The lead is marked .....unbid major.......lead the ace. Dont risk giving trick away to singleton King. 
Kib: I thought you never should lead an unsupported ace. 
lioncub: depends on the bidding. Here the INTELLIGENT LEAD IS THE ACE OF HEART.|

lioncub: 1@D-?  2@C or 1@S? Answer is ........how many bids is the hand worth?  1@S if only worth 1 bid (under 11 points.) If worth 2 bids then clubs first and then spades ........as East did. Bidding again was 100% perfect. Will have diamond and spade loser. West was correct to open based on rule 20. One small point........ as South I would bid 2@H over 2@C. Good 7-card suit-- 3@H is okay too. Rule of 20 is..........add high card points and add to this total number of cards in 2 longest suits. If it is 20 or more then ok to open. 
lioncub: Lead & claim.|

I want you all to remember this hand for the rest of your lives  A double would show 12+ points with shortage in diamonds and GUARANTEEING 4-CARD SUPPORT IN SPADES AND HEARTS WITH TOLERANCE FOR CLUBS. THIS HAND HAS NEITHER and is the 4/3/3/3 hand with under 16 points. With 16 points you can just about bid 1NT. With this hand honestly peoples there is just one bid to make and that is PASS. The rest of bidding ain't so good either. The 1@H response by East would show under 7 points. The bid is 2@H showing 7 to 9 and certainly should bid again over the double by North. But North why double?  West has shown hearts and spades BELIEVE HIM. Just pass. The double by North of course is take out and not penalty. I would bid: 1@D-p-1@H-p;  2@D-p-p-p. A take out double should ideally be 4/4/4/1 with opening hand. Over a minor guarantees both majors. Over a major guarantees 4-cards in other major. lioncub: Lead & claim.|

With one less diamond would have to pass........flat hand. South hand is not suitable for 3@D,,,,,which tends to show 6-card suit and nothing much else outside. It is weak jump overcall. Cannot bid 1NT with Ax in spades. So. the bid to make........by elimination......is 2@D. lioncub: I would bid: 1@S-2@D-p-p; 2@S-X-p-3@C and  all pass.

Never open with 4/3/3/3 hands and only 11 points.........EXCEPT .....when the hand has 2 aces and a king. The bidding went 1@C-1@S ; 1NT-? The rebid is 2@D. This shows a second suit BUT does not promise more than a minimum hand. Partner can pass this or convert to 2@S. If playing NMF, then would have to pass 1NT. South should not double because is too weak that is if North bids 1@c. NMF is new minor force and needs 10+ --used with 11+ points. However, I prefer checkback.

With partner showing under 10 points........2@S seems right bid. 
lioncub: Lead & claim.|

However, at third place you can stretch it a bit.  1@S is sound overcall. Pass by South is okay. Does West like her partner's overcall? The answer is NO. 1NT in West MUST show min of 11 points or a very good ten. Don't forget your partner has not opened......just made an overcall. There is one bid left for West to make ... PASS. On the other hand, East over 1NT should trust West and bid 3NT. An overcall shows a good suit..........not points. Again we are bringing up the topic of disciplined bidding and being able to trust partner to have his bid. The recommended bids are:P-1@H-1@S; P, P, P. Someone just asked whether E should have bid 1NT with 15 points. The answer is no.....always show 5-card major.

Was South right to transfer? definitely. Not saying she will make 2@S,,,,,,,,but saying more chance of tricks in 2 S than in 1NT. Yes ........not a happy choice.  

Kib: Could East have bid 2@d? -Cappelletti. 
lioncub: Nope. Lead & claim.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |
