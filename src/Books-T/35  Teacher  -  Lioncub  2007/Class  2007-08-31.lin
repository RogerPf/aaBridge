^d @e@2Lioncub's bidding session is held every Friday in the BIL at noon NY time. 3 Hands @e@3are bid with 4 volunteers and then change. Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play.......or both. Feel free to ask any questions that are bridge related.

^d @e@2In this presentation we have combined the movie of the hands from lioncub's Friday @e@3Teaching Session with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed version of the chat log transcript.  

The emphasis is presenting to you lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  We did not focus on correctness of the grammar or the spelling.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. Clicking the first will move you forward and clicking the second will take you back. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  Just run your cursor over it for the explanation. 

Further, all the links in this file are clickable - it turns blue when you move your cursor over it.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site.




Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

Kib: cappelletti ?  lioncub: usual version.
lioncub: for more on capp........see my web site at ^*Hwww.zyworld.com/lioncub^*N

lioncub: bidding was fine
lioncub: 2@C was cappalletti showing an unknown 6-card suit, 2@D was relay bid and 2@S is to play.  But only use capp if you want to play the contract........not if you are good enough to defend. I prefer the suit to be better and less in the outside suits......but is acceptable. 

Kib: question can cappalletti  2c show  a 5 card suit? lioncub: Nope.|

This is right 75% of the time. Well done West for not bidding...if you aint got....dont bid.
 
lioncub: once N does bid 2@C then I would be inclined to double (a re-opening double) with E hand. The heart suit is very good,,,,,,,,and a good opportunity to show the 4-card spade suit where then you would find your spade fit. My suggested sequence is 1@H-p-p-p. Not wise to bid 2@S over 2@C cos partner can have 3 hearts and 2 spades. |

lioncub: 1@D-p-? Cannot bid at the 2 level with just 7 points cos it shows 10+. 1NT? or 2@D? or pass?  2@D is my choice as partner will have 4-card suit 80% of the time. The only time it will be 3-carder is if shape is 4/4/3/2.  It certainly is worth a bid I think. E will still bid 2H. The bidding as it went S should be doubling 4@H expecting partner to have 10 points or bid 5@D.

lioncub: my choice will be 1@d-p-2@D-2@H; 4@D (preemptive) which will go round to E who should double (holding 4spades)  and W bids 4@H lioncub: N decides either to double or bid 5@D..........close call. 5@D makes. |

How can E show she is short in spades and has at least 10 points? With 10+ and trump support the bid is 2NT. The answer is REDOUBLE. It shows shortage in spades and 10+ points. The bidding as it went showed long clubs and UNDER 10 points. So W is correct to pass. my bidding 1@S-x-xx-2D. W can either pass 2D showing under or bid 2@H.
 
Kib: whats the diffrnce between ignoring the dble and bidding.....or saying redbl? 
lioncub: competitive bidding IS different bidding entirely. The bid of 2@C is weak. Without intervening bid it would be forcing. SUPPORT DOUBLES AND REDOUBLES LOOK UP ON WEB SITE. So assuming W bids 2@H then E should bid 4@H.
@D@D@D  I have shown my recommended bidding.   @D@D@D|

Suit is just not good enough. But it throws up something of interest which is the bid by N over the 2@H bid. In competition you show a hand with support and 10+ points with a cue bid. This hand is worth 10 points cos of the doubleton heart. So the bid to make over 2@H is 3@H which shows a limit bid or better. 3@S is a direct raise and shows under 10 points.
 
lioncub: my bidding would be.....with no interference would be: 1@S-p-2@C-p; 3@S-p-4@S-p. And with interference (which is not correct) would be 1@S-2@h-3@H-p; 4@S,p p, p. --South hand is not suitable to open 2@C.  Keep 2@C openers for 23+ points or a nine trick hand. |

lioncub: look at E hand. This is the ONLY time you open 1@D with just 3-card suit. when the shape is 4/4/3/2. Better than opening 1@C with just 2. The bidding was 100% correct. Well done all of you.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


pc|C3|mc|0|nt|lioncub: lead not right. Best is 3@D. Cannot lead a major.......too dangerous. 3@D is a safe lead.|

@D Pass 2NT with min and 2 spades
@D Bid 3@S with min and 3 spades......this will be to play.
@D Bid 3NT with max and 2 spades.
@D Bid 4@S with max and 3 spades.

lioncub: please note carefully,,,,you are NOT  asked to use judgement as to the right bid. Those are your ONLY choices. Therefore final bid by S should be 4@S. South's hand shape (4333), not a consideration for 3nt. |

Experts will get this wrong so dont worry too much, great bid by E though. Made it very hard for the Os.
 
lioncub: 1@C-3@D-? 4@D seems correct...but the prob is it takes up too much room.
 
lioncub: 1@C-3@D-? My choice now is to double. This is a negative double. N will now bid 4@C. Now S shows his strength with 4@H. BY BIDDING ANOTHER SUIT AFTER THE NEGATIVE DOUBLE.....SHOWS VERY STRONG HAND. With the singleton spade N should now be interested in slam and bid 6@H.|

N decides that with a hand of 4/3/3/3 then the contract should be 3NT rather than 4H.
Kib: why 2nt after a fit..we have game..4 hearts.
lioncub: the 2@H was all the hand is worth with 4/3/3/3 hand. It shows 3 or 4 hearts and 6-9 points. No answer as to where the points lie. S showed the strength and shape with 2NT and 3NT agrees that this is the right contract. 
Partner can pass 2NT or sign off in 3@H. 
lioncub: let me amplify this in the next page.

pg| ***** 18 ***** |


pc|S3|mc|0|nt|lioncub: 1H-2H  Partner has shown 6 to 9 right?  With a min hand,,,,,,,,you now pass. With 18/19 points you bid game. 
Now then with a hand of a very good 16 and 17 points you ask partner....HOW GOOD ARE YOU FOR YOUR 2H BID?
lioncub: you ask by bidding either 2NT......showing all round strength of hand..........or 3@H.
lioncub: both those bids are asking partner to define his hand within the range of 6-9 points.
Kib: with 15-17 and a 5 card major .... does a NT rebid at the lowest level become wide ranging ? ( 12 - 17 )
lioncub: no.........rebid at one level will still show 12-14.

lioncub: Lead is 3@S.....the unbid major.|
