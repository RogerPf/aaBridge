^d @H@2Lioncub's bidding session is held every Friday in the BIL at noon NY time. 3 Hands @e@3are bid with 4 volunteers and then change. Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play.......or both. Feel free to ask any questions that are bridge related.

^d @H@2What  :|CP||AT| For my later review I like to have a BBO movie representing lioncub's teaching session as close @e@3to the live event as possible. I am delighted that you can also enjoy it.|cp|8|at| 

How  :|CP||AT| In this presentation I have combined the hands from lioncub's Friday Teaching Sessions with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed and edited from the chat. He has approved the bridge information in this movie. You will see the four hands and the auction by the participants and after Allan has asked for a "Lead and Claim." The claim is meaningless and is made so his critique can begin. |cp|8|at| 

Goal :|CP||AT| The emphasis is to present lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  Incorrect grammar and spelling are tolerated. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. All the links in this file are clickable - they turn color when you move your cursor over them.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site. |FP|2|AT|

The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at|^*B HELP^*N |cp||FP|2|at|box at the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section. |FP||CP|8|AT|
 

Please help me improve these movies by sending suggestions to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.|CP||FP||AT|

                                               
                                              Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

^B@2Now, assume that you are sitting South. Review your hand and decide what bid you would have made if you actually were there. Write it down and click the forward arrow. You may find that your bid may be different from the player in time. Continue until the auction is over and there is a lead and claim. Then you will see all four hands. The claim is immaterial and is done so Allan can start his critique and recommendations. Then you can compare your bidding with his recommendations. It is as good as being there. Don't forget that unlike the actual player you would be playing all the boards. Good Luck.|

^B@2lioncub: Excellent lead. 
Bidding was ok up to the 1@H bid. N with that KJ of hearts is worth a 2@D bid. I don't think E can bid 2@S here..............If partner hates spades,,,,,,,,,he will be forced to bid 3@H. Don't punish partner because he protected. The hand was good enough for you to overcall 1@S. Same goes for W. Has no bid after that 2@S bid...............no club stop to bid 2NT. |

^B@2lioncub: The correct lead is the J@D.

lioncub: 1@S-?   N has to make a waiting bid.......as only 3-card support........intending to jump to 4@S next time. BUT  do not bid 2@H. This shows a 5-card suit.........better to tell a lie with either 2@C or 2@D. And S should take his partner's bid of 2@H as being a 5-card suit and now assume that this is the agreed trump suit. With hearts ......then add points for distribution. 16+ 1 for doubleton.........= 17. Sooooooooooo should bid 4@H. |
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT|
^B@2lioncub: S even after making waiting bid of 3@C..........should still bid 4@H over 3NT. A bid at the 2 level shows a 5-card suit..............no problem if a minor. My bidding is:
1@S-2@C
3@C-4@S |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


AT|
hamalca: Why after opening of 1@S p does not say 1NT instead of @C or @D? |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: 1NT would show 6 to 9 points. |

Super bidding by NS. Perfect in fact. |

^B@2lioncub: Correct card to lead is the J@C,  top of sequence or broken sequence. Note the only card missing is the 9. For more information on leads look my article at my web site at ^*Hwww.zyworld.com/lioncub/Leads.htm^*N. 

Super bidding ............very well done. The bidding was perfect...........bidding all 4-card suits up the line. |
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


AT|
PeppeA: So 2NT denies 4 @S and you would bid directly 4 @S, if having 4 @S and 3 @H in south? |

lioncub: Yes. |

NT|
^B@2easybridge: Should E bid 1@s for lead at least.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: Nope. BUT could double the final contract for a spade lead which he was wise not to do. A double of the final contract...........would ask partner to lead dummy's first bid suit. |

^B@2lioncub: Correct lead. 

I am at a loss to understand the E bid of double? Does he hope to beat  a contract of one spade? It cannot be for take out..............there is only one suit left. IT CANNOT BE FOR TAKE OUT. There is a case of course for W to overcall one heart. Not a fantastic suit.........but seen far worse overcalls. |

^B@2lioncub: Good lead. After E opens 1@S...............W evaluates her hand. Spades are agreed suit......so adds 3 points for the singleton heart..............11+3=14.  This is enough for game. So uses Jacoby 2NT to show that. Please note if NOT using Jacoby, then that 4NT bid would be quantatative asking partner to pass with 10 and to bid 6 with 12. My bidding would be:
1@S-2NT-3@S  Then proceed to slam.  This 3@S bid just shows more than min hand...........with min hand bids 4@S. |

AT|
hamalca: How do you know when 4NT is quantitive and not Blackwood? |

^B@2lioncub: Lead is fine.  1@D-2@D Please note the S hand...........ONLY time open 1@D with just 3 card suit...........with this exact shape. Double by E should specifically show the majors and shortage in diamonds. The hand is too flat to make a double..........different if the heart suit had 2 of the top 3 honours. And S, Partner has denied 4 cards in either major.......so what is the point of bidding 2@H?. |
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT|
^B@2lioncub: W, partner has shown both majors..........................double 2@H. Llisten to what the double meant..........it was NOT a penalty double. My bidding:
1@D-p-2@D-p
p-2@H-?  The opps have subsided in 2@D............therefore partner is guaranteed to have 10+ points. Look on my web site ^*Hwww.zyworld.com/lioncub/Home.htm^*N to see description of what balancing is.|

However having opened...............round to S. This is a flat balanced hand with 10-14 points...........the bid here ( in protective position) is 1NT. However, having doubled.............next up is N. Has both majors.......................therefore bid 2@D (cue bid of the opener here) asking partner to bid a major.|

NT|
^B@2hamalca: Sorry I am a slow learner, what is the difference in the final out come if we arrived to the same contract? |
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


AT| 
lioncub: The difference is this. With your bid you want partner to know the strength of your hand. Your bid promisses a shapely hand with only 6/7 points and to play. With your strong hand you should make a waiting bid first and then work your way up to game or even slam if your partner has a strong hand too. |
