^d @H@2Lioncub's bidding session is held every Friday in the BIL at noon NY time. 3 Hands @e@3are bid with 4 volunteers and then change. Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play.......or both. Feel free to ask any questions that are bridge related.

^d @H@2What  :|CP||AT| For my later review I like to have a BBO movie representing lioncub's teaching session as close @e@3to the live event as possible. I am delighted that you can also enjoy it.|cp|8|at| 

How  :|CP||AT| In this presentation I have combined the hands from lioncub's Friday Teaching Sessions with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed and edited from the chat. He has approved the bridge information in this movie. You will see the four hands and the auction by the participants and after Allan has asked for a "Lead and Claim." The claim is meaningless and is made so his critique can begin. |cp|8|at| 

Goal :|CP||AT| The emphasis is to present lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  Incorrect grammar and spelling are tolerated. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. All the links in this file are clickable - they turn color when you move your cursor over them.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site. |FP|2|AT|

The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at|^*B HELP^*N |cp||FP|2|at|box at the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section. |FP||CP|8|AT|
 

Please help me improve these movies by sending suggestions to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.|CP||FP||AT|

                                               
                                              Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

^B@2lioncub: 4@C is correct lead
rq4mulae: low from unsupported nothing?
lioncub: yes
lioncub: my recommendation....gives partner count |
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


NT|
^B@2lioncub: let us deal with supporting partner's overcall 
lioncub: 1@C-1@H-P-?
lioncub: partner has made an overcall of unknown strength
lioncub: you cannot know at this stage how weak or strong he is
lioncub: sooooooooooooooooooo
lioncub: tell him your hand |
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


NT|
^B@2lioncub: this is the rule................please note carefully
lioncub: with trump support..........either 3 or 4 ( partner must have 5)
lioncub: DIRECT RAISES ARE PREEMPTIVE AND SHOW UNDER 7/8 POINTS
lioncub: so 2@H/3@H/4@H............all show under 8 HCP
lioncub: you show support AND 10HCP by cue bidding the opps suit
lioncub: so the bid by W should have been 2@C |
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


NT|
^B@2lioncub: note this says nothing about the club holding...........just shows 10+HCP and trump support
lioncub: then of course it is easy for E to bid game
lioncub: don't let us confuse this lesson with any other observations on the hand..........this is the key point I want to get across.
lioncub: questions? |
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


NT|
^B@2nome: I had question on lead because the @C opening usually does not mean a good holding by the opener  and also I thought that leading a low card means that i have an honour. comments please 
lioncub: with good spade suit you could lead spade. As you do not hold a good spade suit lead partner's suit. That is my rules for leading partner's suit
lioncub: I do not like MUD or top of nothing,,,,,,,,,therefore with 3 small I favour leading the lowest card |
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


NT|
^B@2okbkat: couldn't W bid 2@H to show 10 pts?
lioncub: did you not see what I had to say on this subject?
lioncub: 2@H shows under 7/8 points
irshgypsy: as bidding went,what should i have said 2nd round? |
PG| ***** 9 ***** |

^B@2lioncub: bad choice of lead
lioncub: lead K@S or 2@C.  Either would be right.
lioncub: excellent bid by West.  3@H shows the hand.....weak 7-carder
lioncub: and vulnerability being right
lioncub: BUT  bidding comes round to S. S should stop and think. Has 18, W has say 9. |
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


NT|
^B@2lioncub: that is 27.....leaving 13 points between N and E
lioncub: here is my advice...........split it down the middle.........give half the points to partner
lioncub: your 18 plus 6 from partner ......gives game possible or good double
lioncub: sooooooooooooooooooo double
lioncub: partner will bid 3@S............and you bid game in spades
lioncub: questions? |
PG| ***** 15 ***** |

^B@2nome: poor @d suit stopped me from doubling
lioncub: BUT............you have 4 spades
moonjohn: should east raise partners hearts?
lioncub: nope |

lioncub: no good lead
lioncub: good bidding
lioncub: but................over 2@H...........best bid is 3NT not 2
lioncub: although only 8 points...........does have a 6-card suit
lioncub: questions? |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |

^B@2moonjohn: why not  3@h as lead?
lioncub: E has bid the suit
lioncub: plus a very big tip
lioncub: NEVER lead from suit Jxxx

^B@2lioncub: lead is fine
lioncub: 1@D-p-?
lioncub: strain to keep bidding open if possible. Although only  5 points............look at the intermediate cards
lioncub: J109 surely worth more than 1 point and the 10/9 combination in a 4-card suit
lioncub: E correct to pass. So S is definitely worth a bid of 1@H |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT|
^B@2lioncub: questions?
Geofspa: would N then jump with 19 and 4 card support ?
lioncub: N bids 4@H
dkgrab: not 2NT then
lioncub: nope. Has 4-card heart support 
nome: 1@D-P-1@H-P-4@H-PPP would be reasonable?
lioncub: yes  |

^B@2lioncub: correct lead
lioncub: do you remember me saying in previous sessions..........make the BEST BID AVAILABLE?
lioncub: this is a tough hand to bid
lioncub: 1@C-1@S ;  that is the easy part
lioncub: lets go through the bids available to N
lioncub: 2NT shows a balanced hand of 18/19 points. So that rules that one out
lioncub: can't jump in clubs with just a 4-carder |
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT|
^B@2lioncub: So, here is my advice for what it is worth. Bid 2@D which shows longer clubs than diamonds with 17 plus points. To me .......that is the best bid available and yes it is a reverse. Now S will bid 3@C and N will then close the bidding with 3NT.  Recapping: 
lioncub: 1@C-1@S
lioncub: 2@D-3@C,  
lioncub: 3NT-p |
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT|
^B@2lioncub: questions? 
dae: why not open  1@D  with  4-4 and avoid  the problem?
lioncub: open lowest 4-card suit and bid up the line and it does not remove the problem. Let us go through it.  Open 1@D-1@S.  The 2@C now would show a 5-card diamond suit. That is  bigger lie.
lioncub: as I said.....this is a tough hand to bid, and you have to make a BEST BID AVAILABLE |

lioncub: E must play the K@D on opening lead to save blocking the suit
lioncub: rules for 4th seat light opener are...........use rule of 15
lioncub: add HCP and add number of cards in spades.......if 15 or more........then open
dae: so  should have passed
lioncub: yes Dot |
PG| ***** 38 ***** |

^B@2lioncub: another rule for you...........balanced 11HCP hands........pass.............UNLESS
