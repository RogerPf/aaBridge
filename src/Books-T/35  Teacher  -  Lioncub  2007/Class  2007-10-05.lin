^d @H@2Lioncub's bidding session is held every Friday in the BIL at noon NY time. 3 Hands @e@3are bid with 4 volunteers and then change. Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play.......or both. Feel free to ask any questions that are bridge related.

^d @e@2In this presentation we have combined the movie of the hands from lioncub's Friday @e@3Teaching Session with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed version of chat log transcript.  

The emphasis is presenting to you lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  We did not focus on correctness of the grammar or the spelling.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. Clicking the first will move you forward and clicking the second will take you back. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. 

Further, all the links in this file are clickable - it turns blue when you move your cursor over it.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site.

After clicking    ^$40  you will see all four hands with the bidding by the participants. lioncub has already asked for the lead and claim. Ignore the claim. It is made only to start the discussion. Review the hands and make your biddings and decide on the proper lead. Next you can see lioncub's critique.


Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

lioncub: 1C-1S. Next,  should be  the hand evaluation. E has 15+ 1+1=17  and correctly invites with 3@S.  And to W?  Again  W should do a hand evaluation. Spades is agreed trumps.  He is worth 6+3=9.  So W  should bid 4@S.

Next hand please.|

lioncub:  I agree with W to opens 1@C. This is the only time you open with a flat 11 point hand with two aces and a King.  Next, 1@D followed by  1@H-1@S.  The bid 4-card-suit up the line and forcing to 1NT.  The  1NT rebid by Kia showing balanced hand with 12-14 points is correct.  E says to partner. " I heard your rebid showing 12-14" and bids 2NT telling W, "if you are minimum within that range........pass 2NT, if you are maximum bid 3NT." W is minimum and should pass. 

Next hand please.     |

lioncub: 1@D-1@H-P all three bids are fine. Now choices for S  to  bid in order of preference.  Pass is first choice  followed by pass as second choice and guess what  the 3rd choice is? You got it......very difficult quiz. Yes, pass if you have nothing to say.|

Now, should W to reopen or not to reopen.  TIP OF THE DAY REMEMBER IT WELL. With 3-card holding in opponents' suit PASS IT WILL BE RIGHT FAR MORE TIMES THAN WRONG. On the other hand, W should have opened 1NT with balanced hand and 15 points.  |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |

My bidding would be: 1NT-2@D The 2@D is modified Capp showing unknown 6-card suit and  partner must relay to 2@H. Or you can use whatever system you play over 1NT which shows  6-card suit. 

Next hand please.|

lioncub: 1@D-2@S-?   2@S bid was perfect. A double by S would show a 4-card heart suit.  BUT............this is a 6-card suit.............don't be shy. However........having doubled......and hearing 4@S bid by W (great bid by the way)  S  must not sell out.  Bid 5@D. As you can see NS make 6@D or 6@H.

lioncub: Let me see if we can get this right. In competitive bidding : ALL DIRECT RAISES ARE SHOWING LESS THAN 10 POINTS. You show support and 10+ with .........A CUE BID.  1@h-2@d-2@h-?   NORTH  HAND IS TOO GOOD FOR JUST 3@D.  The bid to make is 3@H. That is the first duty of the hand.......to tell partner you have 10+ points. Then, the  3@S bid by E is a bit ambiguous.......it is forcing to game. However, E has too many losers to insist on game.|

Rules for preemptive openings in 1st or 2nd seat. The bid suit no worse than headed by KJ9;  no strong defensive tricks  AND NO 3-CARD SUIT TO AN HONOUR IN OTHER MAJOR.  THE REASON IS TO TELL PARTNER NOT TO BID WITH A 5-CARD SUIT IN THE OTHER MAJOR.  PREEMPTIVE BIDS SHOULD ONLY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO OPPONENTS.........AND NOT TO PARTNER.  WEST THEN COMPOUNDED THE ERROR BY BIDDING THE HAND TWICE.  |

pg| ***** 47 ***** |


at|
lioncub: reasoning is flawed.  It is because of your strength.......you want them to bid.  In fact  by using Rule 20 you should open 1@H.  My bidding  1@H-p-2@H-PPP. Your partner is strong enough to compete. |

lioncub: 2@S-?  N has  only one bid to consider..........and that is 3@H. If the opponents now bid 4@S you can then...........if you are brave enough............bid 4NT.......which would show the minors as well as hearts. My bidding would be  2@S-3@H-4@S-p ;  4NT-p-5@C-p . |
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


nT| 
lioncub: the 4NT bid is made by the player who bid 3@H. Bear in mind that 3@H could be passed out too.  That was a difficult hand......don't worry too much about it. |

OCTOBER 5, 2007 }

ht|f|cp||fp|4|at|^d @e@2The 4NT bid is shown in my recommended bidding

2@S-3@H-4@S-P

p - 4NT (?)- P - 5@C 

p p p --  Here 4NT is saying pick a suit in the minors if you do not hold 3 hearts.

                                       Use of 4NT in a competitive auction

Your LHO opens 1@H followed by 2@D from your partner. RHO now bids 4@H. You pass, LHO passes, and 
your partner now bids 4NT. The auction so far is

1@H-2@D-4@H- P

P--4NT -p - 5@C

What is this 4NT bid? Lets go through the alternatives. Can it be to play? Surely not. He would need 
10 tricks on top, which would mean a solid 9-card suit with stopper in spades. With that hand he 
would double first.

Is it for take out? No. He would double if that was the case. That would show spades, plus partial 
support for Clubs. Is it a 2 suited hand with clubs as well? No. He would bid 5@C to show 6/5 or 5/5. 
This bid guarantees a good 6-card ( or better) Diamond suit PLUS a 4-card Club suit- and a 
willingness to play in a 5 level contract rather than just tamely bidding 5@D, he is telling ONLY 
bid 5@C with 4 Clubs, otherwise bid 5@D Diamonds.

That was the last board for today. You all did well. Have a great week @E@3everyone. See all next week. byeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

Kibs: Thank you Allan. Great lesson.|
