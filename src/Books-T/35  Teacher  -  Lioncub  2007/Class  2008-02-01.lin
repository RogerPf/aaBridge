^d @H@2Lioncub's bidding session is held every Friday in the BIL at noon NY time. 3 Hands @e@3are bid with 4 volunteers and then change. Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play.......or both. Feel free to ask any questions that are bridge related.

^d @H@2What  :|CP||AT| For my later review I like to have a BBO movie representing lioncub's teaching session as close @e@3to the live event as possible. I am delighted that you can also enjoy it.|cp|8|at| 

How  :|CP||AT| In this presentation I have combined the hands from lioncub's Friday Teaching Sessions with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed and edited from the chat. He has approved the bridge information in this movie. You will see the four hands and the auction by the participants and after Allan has asked for a "Lead and Claim." The claim is meaningless and is made so his critique can begin. |cp|8|at| 

Goal :|CP||AT| The emphasis is to present lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  Incorrect grammar and spelling are tolerated. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. All the links in this file are clickable - they turn color when you move your cursor over them.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site. |FP|2|AT|

The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at|^*B HELP^*N |cp||FP|2|at|box at the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section. |FP||CP|8|AT|
 

Please help me improve these movies by sending suggestions to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.|CP||FP||AT|

                                               
                                              Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

SB|W I hope my hand satisfies Rule 15?|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


NT|
^B@2Yes, BUT you ain't got it. lol. 
Rule of 15 determines whether to open light in 3rd or 4th seat. Add points and add number of cards in spades......if total is 15 or more.....safe to open.|

^B@2lioncub: The best lead is 2@C.  
Now, lets look at Geof''s hand though. Here we use another rule.........the rule of 20. Add high card points and add to this total the number of cards in 2 longest suits. If answer is 20 or more....please open. So it is safe for Geoff to open 1@S. My bidding would be:
1@S-2@H-P-P 
3@C-p-3@S-p  Geoff should pass 3@S.......but if he pushes and bids one more,,,,,,,he will make 4.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


NT|
^B@2lioncub: 
Rule of 15 is a safety measure to avoid being outbid in spades.
Rule of 20.........although light..........has a 2nd suit to bid.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


AT| 
tiburonero: Does rule of 15 applies to all suits? |
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: No............just spades. You can open with any suit...........BUT you only add on number of spades in your hand.|

^B@2lioncub: Wrong lead.........must lead partner's suit.............lead the Q@D. Now the bidding.
lioncub: 1@D-?  Note this phrase...........I use it often. Make THE BEST BID AVAILABLE. 15 - 18 points and balanced  is a 1NT overcall. And here 18 points even though just a small doubleton heart.............1NT is the BBA. Now to South hand. How to show 5/4 in the majors............stayman is not the answer....as can't find out if partner has 3 hearts. Bidding as South did.............ie 2@H over the 2@D bid...........shows the 5/4 hand..........BUT IS DROP DEAD. Partner must pass..............no other option. So do it like this:|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT| 
^B@2Over 1NT bid 2@D to show 5 hearts. Partner bids 2@H..........and you now bid 2@S showing the 5/4 hand........and forcing.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


AT|  
robzim: If you have 5@S and 4@H do the same?|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: Yes. You bid 2@H and over the forced 2@S response, you then bid 3@H. This shows the 5/4 hand and invites the NT bidder to pick the final contract.  Please note this is how to bid the 5/4 hand with enough points for game..........good 9 or 10. With a weak hand ie 7 or less and  holding 5/4 in the majors.............use stayman. And then if partner bids 2D denying a 4-card major, You now bid your 5-card suit. This last bid will be to play, and partner MUST pass.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT|
^B@2My recommended bidding on this particular hand would be
1@D-1NT-p-2@D
p - 2@H - p - 2@S
p - 2NT-p-3NT
This sequence allows declarer to play in 3NT as he did not have a 4-card major or a 3-card heart suit.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


AT|
Panim: Using stayman usually promises min of 8. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: You can do it with very much less............if your hand is 5/4.|

^B@2lioncub: I still lead a spade, attack.
lioncub: 1@D-p-?  Look at the lovely heart suit South is holding. Surely the hand is worth the extra point..............bid 1@H. It is less dangerous than passing and then coming in with 2@H. My bidding:
1@D-p-1@H-1@S    :   X-p-2@H-p-p-p|

^B@2lioncub: The only lead to make.  1@D-P Now to the East. Pass or 1@S? It really is too close to say yes or no. The qJX of partner's suit,,,,,,,,,,,in my opinion sways it to open. But I would not argue if someone says.........no the hand is too weak. 2@H shows the points and shape and Jimmy correctly bids 3@D. Now W completes painting the picture of the hand with 3@S and Jimmy dismisses 3NT. Personally I would bid 3NT. 9 tricks being easier to make than 11. 4@D cannot be criticised though..........but of course there is no way that partner is going to pass and 5@D will fail.|

PG| ***** 34 ***** |

lioncub: No. He bid min with each bid. 3@D showed absolute min. Partner kept making forcing bids. 2@H was a reverse and 3@S was 100% forcing inviting partner to bid 4@S with a 5-card suit.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |

^B@2lioncub: Lead is correct.
lioncub: Remember this...........................in competition.......all direct raises are preemptive. Show points with a cue bid of opps suit. My bidding:
1@D-p-1@H-1NT
2@H-p-p---p
When opponents bid 2 suits use the 1NT bid to show 5/5 in the other 2 suits. Note a double will show under 5/5 in the other 2 suits, and will have more points.|

Okay,  odds are against making slam  when East bid 3@D. That showed a min hand. My bidding:

3NT-p    East bids 3NT with trepidation. 3@S shows slam interest..........whereas 3NT would be shut out.|
