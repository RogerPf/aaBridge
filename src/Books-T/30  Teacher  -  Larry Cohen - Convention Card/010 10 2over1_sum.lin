^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|In this new series (updated and revised from the previous decade), I want to take the reader through the ACBL Convention Card. I will give my advice on what conventions are important, and which are not. My opinions reflect 25 years of writing and teaching and are aimed at the intermediate level. This series is not for beginners and not for National Champions. Anyone in between will hopefully benefit from my thoughts.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

I am very much in the KISS (Keep It Simple Sweetheart) School.  I believe that focus on declarer play and defense is much more important than adding a fancy convention. If a convention is hard to memorize I will not endorse it. If it is highly artificial, I will say NO. If it doesn't come up much, it shouldn't be in your arsenal. The only conventions I will endorse, must meet all three of these requirements:
^cNot highly artificial;
^CEasy to remember and play;
^cComes up frequently.|

That said, I will touch on EVERY convention listed on the ACBL Convention Card.  I will downplay the "ones to do without" and fully explain those to "do with." |

In a nutshell, this bidding system uses 2-level responses (in new suits below the suit opened) as forcing to game. In conjunction, a 1NT response is used for all hands up to about 12 HCP.|

^-|cs||fp||va|4|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|In its simplest terms, the "system" described as 2-over-1 game-forcing refers to the following 6 bids :|

ht|n|at|^B@2When responder uses a game-forcing "2-over-1" bid he is informing opener that he, too, holds at least opening-bid values. Accordingly, the partnership may leisurely proceed to the optimum contract without fear of being dropped below game. Opener then should show his "shape," without implying number of HCP.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Although, these days, the majority play that bidding 2C over 1@D establishes a game force, I prefers to play that 2@C over 1@D only guarantees invitational values (10+ points). The reason is that there is no good bid available when responder holds an invitational hand with clubs. Over 1 of a major, responder has the option of bidding a forcing NT with invitational values. But there is no forcing NT available over 1@D.|

ht|m|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|One partnership issue that needs to be resolved is whether or not a reverse by opener shows extra values (16+). Most play that, once a game force is established, opener simply bids out his shape, as in this example, but that a reverse does not promise extra values. That is what Howard plays. However, another reasonable approach is to play that reverses do show extra values. This makes it easier to find slams where both partners have medium hands (around 16 points).|

^-|cs||fp||va|4|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|An important Feature of the 2/1 GF system is to employ a 1NT bid (by an unpassed hand) in response to a major-suit opening bid as forcing (or semi-forcing) for one round. Unlike Standard American, this bid ^*Bis not limited to 6 to 9 HCP. Normally, it shows 6 to 12 HCP.^*N|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


AT|

If 1NT is totally forcing, opener CANNOT pass! If he has nothing special to say, he must invent a bid, typically in a 3-card minor. For example, after 1@S-P-1NT, if opener holds the following hand:
|HT|l|cs|6|at|^b  {|ih|pSA J T 8 2H9 7 3DA 2CK J 2|at|},|ht|l|at|^l@2 the appropriate rebid is 2@C. Opener cannot rebid his major since this would show a 6 card suit. He cannot make a 2@H call because a rebid of the other major shows at least a 4-card suit. Lastly, he can't pass if 1NT is forcing, and he cannot bid 2@D, a 2-card suit. (Personally, I prefer to use 1NT as "semi-forcing"'so that opener can pass with a hand like the one above.)|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


ht|r|at|^B@2Openers's Rebids after 1NT forcing:

2 minor ' at least a 3-card suit (note: 2@C can be exactly 4=5=2=2 if not strong enough to reverse)
2 new major ' at least a 4-card suit (if reverse, shows extras)
2 same major ' at least a 6-card suit, NF
2NT ' more than a strong notrump, balanced

^-|cs||fp||va|4|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|2-over-1 is game-forcing as long as responder is not a passed hand and there is no interference bidding (so, in competition, 2/1 is NOT game forcing). Some partnerships may choose to play that if responder rebids his original suit, the game-forcing Feature is off.|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|I strongly recommends against playing that way. That defeats the whole purpose of playing 2/1 and makes it almost impossible to bid many hands where opener has a nice hand with a 6-card suit and wants to possibly explore for slam while keeping the bidding at a low level.|

^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|The 2/1 Game Forcing system is really an outgrowth of Standard American and 5-card Majors and many of the methods and conventions employed are alike. There are many more details'this mini-lesson is intended only as a brief overview of the principles.|

A 2-over 1 game force is not alertable. The 1NT response is announced (by the opener) as "Forcing" or "Semi-forcing" -- whatever the partnership has agreed.|
