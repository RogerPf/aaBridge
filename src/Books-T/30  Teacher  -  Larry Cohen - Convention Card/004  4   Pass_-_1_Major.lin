^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|In this new series (updated and revised from the previous decade), I want to take the reader through the ACBL Convention Card. I will give my advice on what conventions are important, and which are not. My opinions reflect 25 years of writing and teaching and are aimed at the intermediate level.  This series is not for beginners and not for National Champions. Anyone in between will hopefully benefit from my thoughts.|

I am very much in the KISS (Keep It Simple Sweetheart) School.  I believe that focus on declarer play and defense is much more important than adding a fancy convention.  If a convention is hard to memorize I will not endorse it. If it is highly artificial, I will say NO. If it doesn't come up much, it shouldn't be in your arsenal. The only conventions I will endorse, must meet all three of these requirements:|

ht|T|at|^b@2In each case, the 3rd or 4th seat opening was 1-of-a-major. For the responder, what should change? Last month, when responder was an UPH ("unpassed hand") there were all sorts of strong possibilities (such as a Jacoby 2NT raise, Splinter bids, 2/1 Game-force responses). Now, the responder has at most 11, maybe 12 points. Everything is different. ^*BEverything, that is, except a single raise. 1@H-2@H and 1@S-2@S should retain the same meaning as by an UPH.^*N|

the auction on left shows hearts. What strength? About 9-11 HCP. It is natural (5-card suit), and not forcing. It will usually not be a 6-card suit (no weak two-bid). |

at| ^*BIt should be a decent five-card suit, as a 1NT response to 1@S would be preferable with something like:^*N|

ht|u|va|4|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Cohen did not touch on whether or not 1NT should still be forcing by a passed hand. I suspect that he would say it is "semi-forcing" (meaning opener can pass with 5-3-3-2 distribution and 12-14 HCP). I personally think it should still be forcing. One reason is that you need it forcing so responder can bid 1NT followed by 3 of opener's major to show a 3-card limit raise (unless you play Drury). In general, I prefer to keep things simpler by playing that bids by responder have the same meaning whether or not they are a passed hand. The only exception is that 2 over 1 bids are no longer game forcing, simply natural bids showing invitational strength.|

^-|cs||fp||VA|4|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|A 2NT response can no longer be a Jacoby 2NT raise (game forcing). You can use it as natural (11-12, balanced, probably a doubleton in support). Or, you could define it as something special. Rather than use anything complex, I'd recommend that most intermediate players leave it as undefined. I prefer a passed-hand 1NT response to be up to 11 (maybe a terrible 12) points.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


ht|g|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Although Larry Cohen is basically right that, since responder is a passed hand, it is very unlikely that responder can make a Jacoby 2N bid (game forcing raise with 4+ card support), it is possible. Suppose, for example, opener has 10 HCP with 5-4-2-2 distribution. That is not quite an opener. However, now responder can now count 13 dummy points -- 10 HCP, 1 length point, and 2 points for the 2 doubletons. That is enough for a Jacoby 2NT bid. So I recommend that 2NT still be Jacoby 2N, even by a passed hand.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


ht|l|va|4|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|I like to play jumps in new suits as fit-showing. They promise 4-card support and a concentration in the suit jumped into. For example, I would bid 3@D with:|
ht|o|cs|6|at|^B{|ia|,pp1sp3d|at|}|HT|n|cs|6|3d|5|at|^m  {|ih|pSSQ T 9 8H4 3DA Q J 5 4C5 4|at|}|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


ht|r|va|6|at|
If you play Bergen Raises, be sure to discuss if they are on by a Passed Hand (I recommend NO'preferring PH jumps to be fit-showing). Jump raises by a passed hand (if you are using Drury) are a strange animal. I recommend that a 3-level raise is 4-5 trumps and weakish (at most 9 points in support).|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|I prefer that Bergen is still on by a passed hand. I see no reason not to play that. You get many more Bergen raise hands than hands that qualify for the fit-showing jump shift that Cohen recommends. (I would bet you would be lucky if you made that bid more than 2 or 3 times a year.) I don't particularly like Drury (especially because I don't think opening light in 3rd seat is that great an idea) so I still play that 3@D (Regular Bergen) or 3@C (Reverse Bergen) shows a limit raise.

^-|cs||fp||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|I'm not a convention pusher, but this one is in my top dozen. After a 3rd- or 4th-seat major-suit opening, I strongly recommend using 2@C as an artificial raise. It shows 3+ trumps and 10+ points in support (counting shape). This allows your partnership to stop on the 2-level if the opening was light. Without Drury, the responder would have to make a limit 3-level raise and get your side to the three-level (too high) when opener is on the light side.|

^-|cs||fp||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|How does opener respond to Drury? Modern day methods dictate that opener "signs off" in 2-MAJ with a minimum (no game interest). So in the following auction:|
ht|g|cs|6|at|^B{|ia|,pp1sp2cp2s|at|}|HT|g|at|^M@22@S= No game interest. (Could be a very light opener, or just some minimum)|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


ht|k|AT|^B@2

Anything by opener other than 2@S is naturalish and shows game interest (or more!). Technically, this is called "Reverse-Drury" since it is opposite of how it was first invented. However, this is the way everyone plays it today.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


AT|

Some players use 2-way Drury. Two clubs is described as above, but shows exactly 3-card support. With 4-card support, the Drury bid is 2@D. This forfeits a natural 2@D response, and also adds some memory strain (not a good one to forget).|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


AT|

Drury is not used after a minor-suit opening, and should not be on in competition (if they double or overcall)'be sure to discuss this!|

In the next article, we will discuss handling interference after our 1@H or 1@S.|
