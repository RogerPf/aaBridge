^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|In this new series (updated and revised from the previous decade), I want to take the reader through the ACBL Convention Card. I will give my advice on what conventions are important, and which are not. My opinions reflect 25 years of writing and teaching and are aimed at the intermediate level.  This series is not for beginners and not for National Champions. Anyone in between will hopefully benefit from my thoughts.|

I am very much in the KISS (Keep It Simple Sweetheart) School.  I believe that focus on declarer play and defense is much more important than adding a fancy convention.  If a convention is hard to memorize I will not endorse it. If it is highly artificial, I will say NO. If it doesn't come up much, it shouldn't be in your arsenal. The only conventions I will endorse, must meet all three of these requirements:|

  Larry Cohen - Date of publish: 1/15/2014 - Level: Intermediate  }
^-|cs||fp||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|Last month, we discussed our general system approach and the parameters for a strong 2@C opening. This month, we explore the follow-ups after the 2@C opening.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |

I frequently get asked about this. I give my usual answer: "There are many methods--all with good and bad attributes. Just pick one and live with it. It is not too important which method--as long as your partner knows it and is playing the same way!" I do, however, have a strong preference for one method over the other.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


AT|

Some people use control (or "step") responses. I've never been a big fan. Others use 2@D as "negative." This strikes me as a poor approach. I prefer to use 2@D as "waiting." It could be a zero-count, but it also could be quite a good hand. More on this in a moment. Another method is to use 2@H as negative (0-3) and 2@D as an artificial positive game-force. This is okay, but not what I recommend. Let's examine the most common (by far) method (and the one I do recommend):|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


cs|6|AT|

^-{    2C-2D Waiting    }
^-|at|^B@2
Using 2@C-2@D waiting, you will find that on almost all hands the response is 2@D. When would you not respond 2@D? With a good hand and a good 5 card suit, you can respond in the suit. What is "good?" At least 8 HCP and usually 2 of the top 4 honors. I would not respond in a suit of Axxxx or K10xxx. I would not make a positive response with only 6 HCP even if the suit were good enough. If I don't have a good 5+ card suit and 8 HCP, I respond 2@D--waiting. (I would never respond 2NT even with notrump shape/stoppers/points--risking playing notrump from the wrong side and also taking away opener's room).|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


AT|

So, a 2@D response shows "^*Bany hand that lacks 8 HCP and a good 5+ card suit.^*N" It can be a balanced 14-count! It can be a 0-count. Let s look at some examples of 2@D responses to 2@C (using 2@D as "waiting:)|

^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|With a balanced hand, this is easy. 2@C-2@D-2NT shows 22-24 balanced (assuming a 2NT opener would have 20-21). With 25-27, rebid 3NT. (After these notrump rebids, Stayman and transfers are on.)|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |

With an unbalanced hand, opener names his long suit. This is FORCING, but NOT GAME FORCING. It is important to study that last sentence.|

If responder's first bid was 2@D, he can pass a 2NT rebid by opener. What if opener bids a suit? 2@C-P-2@D-P-2@H:|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


AT|

After opener bids a suit, the most popular approach is to use "cheaper minor second negative." The terminology is a little dated since there was never a "first" negative. Anyway, next are the auctions we are discussing:|

ht|g|at|^b{|ia|o2c2d3d3h|at|}|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


ht|g|at|^j@2
In each case, responder has bid the cheaper minor (but note the exception is the use of 3@H over 3@D so as to not zoom past 3NT).|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


ht|k|AT|^b@2
When responder bids the cheaper minor he is typically showing a very bad hand. He is saying: "Partner, if you repeat your suit, you might not hear from me again--we can stop short of game." So, any of the following auctions could occur:|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


ht|n|cs|6|at|^b{|ia|o2C2D2H3C3HP|at|}|ht|n|at|^j{|ia|o2C2D2S3C3SP|at|}|ht|n|at|^r{|ia|o2C2D3C3D4CP|at|}|

pg| ***** 35 ***** |


ht|u|at|^j@2
None of this is very likely. Usually when opener rebids something other than 2NT, game is reached. After the "double negative," if opener bids a new suit, that is forcing.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |

What if responder doesn't use a double negative?|

Both of these are game-forcing (especially since one of the bids is game!). But, which shows more?

Have you heard of "fast arrival?" This principle says: "Once you are forced to game, jumping to the game is actually weaker." The "fast arrival" into game (4@H) says: "Partner, I am dead minimum, interested only in game. If you bid again, do so because you have extras." Accordingly, the slower bid of raising to 3@H shows extras and slam interest. The logic is that with slam interest you should leave the most room for exploration.|

^-{    2C-2D Waiting - 2nd Negative by Howard Schutzman   }
^-|cs||cp||cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|If you want to play the complete set of 2nd negatives recommended by Larry Cohen (3@C over 2@H or 2@S, 3@D over 3@C, and 3@H over 3@D) that is very reasonable. But I have a slightly different approach. I do like 3@C as 2nd negative over 2@H or 2@S. But I play there is no way to show a bust hand over 3@C or 3@D.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


AT|

First of all, I strain not to open 2@C and then rebid 3 of a minor. I will usually either rebid 2N or not open 2@C. So, for me, the auctions 2@C-2@D-3@C and 2@C-2@D-3@D almost never come up. And second of all, because the auction is already at such a high level (our first natural bid is at the 3-level) I think it is more important to be able to bid naturally and preserve space. |
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


AT|

So I am willing to give up the ability to show a bust hand. Bust hands, even over 2C openers, are pretty rare. So I don't worry about the very rare case where there is a 2@C opener followed by a 3 of a minor rebid and responder has a bust hand. |
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


AT|

I just bid naturally over 3 of a minor. If responder has a bust hand, so be it. You are still more likely than not to end up in the right place because responder can bid natural suits.|

^-|cs||fp||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|Know what you play after a 2@C opener. I recommend 2@D waiting. Remember that 2C is not 100% forcing to game. The approach listed here is not complete, but more than sufficient for any players not competing in National Championships. If you want to load up your brain with tons of additional agreements, be my guest, but I believe that "less is more."



Next month, we move on to opening 1-suit bids with my (un)conventional thoughts.|
