^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|In this new series (updated and revised from the previous decade), I want to take the reader through the ACBL Convention Card. I will give my advice on what conventions are important, and which are not. My opinions reflect 25 years of writing and teaching and are aimed at the intermediate level. This series is not for beginners and not for National Champions. Anyone in between will hopefully benefit from my thoughts.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

I am very much in the KISS (Keep It Simple Sweetheart) School. I believe that focus on declarer play and defense is much more important than adding a fancy convention. If a convention is hard to memorize I will not endorse it. If it is highly artificial, I will say NO. If it doesn't come up much, it shouldn't be in your arsenal. The only conventions I will endorse, must meet all three of these requirements:
^cNot highly artificial;
^CEasy to remember and play;
^cComes up frequently.|

That said, I will touch on EVERY convention listed on the ACBL Convention Card.  I will downplay the "ones to do without" and fully explain those to "do with." |

^B@2^*BMM:^*N This concludes the article as it appears as a new version in his website. Here, Larry does not fully explain the Feature or Ogust. If interested please study Howard's tutorial on "^*BOgust^*N" at 
|CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=ogust^*N|CP||AT|. 

BTW, Howard thinks Ogust is better than feature. Ogust lets you describe both the quality of your suit and the strength of your hand. It leads to more accurate bidding when the responder to a weak-2 opener has an invitational hand. However, most players overuse 2NT. It is rare that responder wants to bid 2N. On most hands, responder should either pass or raise based on the number of cards in opener's suit.

Also you can study the "^*BA Comprehensive Review of Weak-2 Opening Bids^*N" by Howard Schutzman at

^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|This popular convention is used after your partner opens with a weak two-bid. 

After a 2@D, 2@H, or 2@S weak two-opener a response of 2NT is conventional. A small percentage use it as "Ogust," but most common is "Feature."  The 2NT bidder has at least game (maybe slam) interest. As to what might constitute "interest," see "The Rule of 17." |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.larryco.com/bridge-learning-center/detail/455^*N|CP||
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


AT|

A "Feature" is usually an ^*Bace^*N or ^*Bking^*N. It is never a singleton or void. Occasionally, it can be a queen or even a jack with length.

Here are the responses to the 2NT inquiry:

^CRebid of the Weak-2 suit: ANY MINIMUM (might actually have a "feature" as well).

^CRebid in a new suit: ANY NON-MINIMUM, with a "feature" in the suit bid. 

^CRebid of 3NT: NON-MINIMUM with a "solid" suit.|

You must decide if this is a minimum (in which case rebid 3@S) or a non-minimum (in which case rebid 3@D to show the feature). This could depend on your preempting style (is it a maximum for YOU?). |
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Also important is position and vulnerability. For a 2nd seat Vulnerable preempt, I'd consider this a minimum and would rebid 3@S. For a dealer favorable-vulnerability preempt, I'd consider it a maximum and would rebid 3@D.|
