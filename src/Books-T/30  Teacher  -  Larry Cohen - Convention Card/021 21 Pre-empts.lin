^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|In this new series (updated and revised from the previous decade), I want to take the reader through the ACBL Convention Card. I will give my advice on what conventions are important, and which are not. My opinions reflect 25 years of writing and teaching and are aimed at the intermediate level. This series is not for beginners and not for National Champions. Anyone in between will hopefully benefit from my thoughts.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |

I am very much in the KISS (Keep It Simple Sweetheart) School. I believe that focus on declarer play and defense is much more important than adding a fancy convention. If a convention is hard to memorize I will not endorse it. If it is highly artificial, I will say NO. If it doesn't come up much, it shouldn't be in your arsenal. The only conventions I will endorse, must meet all three of these requirements:
^cNot highly artificial;
^CEasy to remember and play;
^cComes up frequently.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |

That said, I will touch on EVERY convention listed on the ACBL Convention Card.  I will downplay the "ones to do without" and fully explain those to "do with." |

cs||fp||ht|f|va|5|cp|8|AT|^h@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|Style is everything. We've reached the 21st month in this series and we're preempting again.

There is a box on the Convention card that addresses opening preempts. You can mark LIGHT, NORMAL, or SOUND. You might choose to base this on vulnerability (some players mark "SOUND--vulnerable").

Whatever your style, the most important things are:
^*B1) Make sure partner knows your style and you know his.
2) Stick to that style. Don't zig and zag.^*N

One popular preempting guideline is the rule of 2,3,4 which means:|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


HT|q|at|^B@2If you are Vulnerable against not, you are within 2 tricks of your preempt (for example, you can open 3@H with |
ht|r|ih|pHKQJT987|ht|s|at|^g@2 and maybe a side king). At equal vulnerability you are within 3 tricks of your bid and at favorable, within four. I suggest reading  this article |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.larryco.com/bridge-learning-center/detail/62^*N|CP||AT| for more detailed thoughts on style. Also, see my article |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.larryco.com/bridge-learning-center/detail/25^*N|CP||AT| in this series on two-bids.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


ht|w|at|^B@2In general, 2-level preempts are made with 6-card suits, 3-level preempts with 7-card suits, and 4-level preempts with 8-card suits. Note, the words "in general"--there is no rule that you have to abide by. Position is very important. When you are in 2nd seat, your preempting shouldn't be too reckless (because one of your opponents has already passed, there is a good chance the contract belongs to your side). In third seat, when your partner has already passed, you can loosen up and preempt more often.|

^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|When you respond to a preempt, you have to take many things into account. For example, say partner opens 2@H and you have:|
ht|c|ih|pSK Q 2HK 2DA J 8 7 3CJ T 2|ht|c|at|^j@2
If partner is a sound preemptor, and you are vulnerable (especially at team scoring or opposite a 2nd-seat preempt), you might just bid 4@H.  If partner is a "medium " preemptor, you might bid 2NT to find out if he is minimum or maximum. If he is an aggressive preemptor, you probably should pass. It is so important to know partner's style!|

^*B4th seat^*N: In fourth seat, can you open with a preempt (after 3 passes)? Sure. For a 4th seat weak-two, you should have a decent six-card suit and about 10-13 HCP (with less, you would pass the hand out). A 3-level preempt in 4th seat would contain a 7-card suit. After 3 passes, I would open 3@H with something like:|
ht|k|ih|pS2HK Q J T 8 7 3DQ J 9 2C2|ht|k|at|^j@2
(This hand would be too good to open 3@H in any other position.)|

^-|cs||fp||ht|d|at|^B@2Namyats |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.larryco.com/bridge-learning-center/detail/214^*N|CP||AT|: Namyats is a convention that employs a 4-of-a-minor opening to show a strong 4-of-a-major opening.|

4@C = A strong 4@H opening

4@D = A strong 4@S opening|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |

What does "strong" mean? Let's assume you deal with nobody vulnerable. Consider these two hands:|HT|k|AT|^BA)    |IH|P S5HK Q J T 7 6 5 3D4 3C5 4|AT|^MB)     |IH|PS-HA Q J T 8 7 6 2DK Q 2C4 3|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


HT|p|AT|^B@2With both hands, you'd like to preempt 4@H to make it difficult on the opponents. The first hand is somewhat normal, but the 2nd hand is really too good to preempt--you could easily miss a slam. Playing Standard, I'd open Hand A) with 4@H, but Hand B) with 1@H.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


AT|

Playing Namyats, you still open Hand A) with 4@H, but can open Hand B) with 4@C to tell partner you have "extra." The exact amount of extra depends on vulnerability and position. If vulnerable, a 4-level preempt is sound to begin with, so a Namyats opening would be even better than sound. Still, the hand can't be too strong; I would open 2@C, not Namyats (4@D) with:     |ih|pSA K Q J 8 7 6 2HA Q DA 3C2|

^-|cs||fp||ht|d|at|^B@2After a Namyats opening, the partner has several choices. With no slam interest, he will sign-off in 4-of-the-shown major. With mild slam interest, he can bid the in-between-step. For example, after a 4@C opening, say responder holds:|
ht|f|ih|pSA 8 7 6 5H2DA J 5 4CK 8 3.|
ht|k|at|^b@2He can bid 4@D to say : Pard, I am mildly interested--if you have a little extra, please cooperate with me. This bid says nothing about diamonds--it is completely artificial. The partner of a Namyats opener can also use Blackwood, control-bid, or just bid a slam.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


AT| 

^*BWhen is it on?^*N
The partnership must discuss if this is on in all 4 seats. Also, you lose the ability to open a 4-level preempt in a minor. Some pairs using Namyats play that a 3NT opener shows a 4-of-a-minor preempt. In case you haven't noticed, if you spell Namyats backwards, you will see a very familiar convention.|

CP||fp||at|^b@2
Howard thinks no one should use the rule of 2, 3, and 4 to decide whether or not to preempt. Howard happens to know that Larry Cohen does not use this rule either but simply included it for completeness. This is a very old fashioned rule that is no longer in favor by any experienced player, even those who believe in sound preempts.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


AT|

As you know,  Howard believes that you should preempt with any hand that is less than an opener and has the right suit length (open a weak 2 with a 6-card suit, a weak 3 with a 7-card suit, and a weak 4 with an 8-card suit), regardless of suit quality. You are protected by the Law of Total Tricks because partner will usually have at least enough length to make the bid follow the Law (and often will have more length). You can be slightly more cautious vulnerable with a bad suit.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


AT|

Regarding the best time to preempt. Although you definitely should still preempt in 2nd seat, that is the least advantageous seat to preempt. Partner is more likely to have a good hand and you may occasionally preempt partner. But, for you timid preempters, don't use that as an excuse not to preempt! |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


AT|

In 3rd seat, when you hold a singleton or void, it is often advantageous to preempt one higher than in other seats -- open a weak 2 with a 5-card suit, a weak 3 with a 6-card suit, etc. -This is especially true at favorable vulnerability (you are not vulnerable and the opponents are vulnerable). When you hold a weak hand in 3rd seat, it is a certainty that 4th seat has at least a nice opener, so you want to make it as difficult as you can for the opponents to bid accurately.|
