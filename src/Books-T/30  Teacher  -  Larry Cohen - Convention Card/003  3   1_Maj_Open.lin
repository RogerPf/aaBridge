^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|In this new series (updated and revised from the previous decade), I want to take the reader through the ACBL Convention Card. I will give my advice on what conventions are important, and which are not. My opinions reflect 25 years of writing and teaching and are aimed at the intermediate level.  This series is not for beginners and not for National Champions. Anyone in between will hopefully benefit from my thoughts.|

I am very much in the KISS (Keep It Simple Sweetheart) School.  I believe that focus on declarer play and defense is much more important than adding a fancy convention.  If a convention is hard to memorize I will not endorse it. If it is highly artificial, I will say NO. If it doesn't come up much, it shouldn't be in your arsenal. The only conventions I will endorse, must meet all three of these requirements:|

^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|Last month, we looked at 2@C Openings (as part of the general approach). Now, we delve into major-suit openings on the one-level.|cs|6|fp|1|ht|h|at|^-{      Opening 1H or 1S      }
^-|cs||fp||ht|k|at|In some countries (like England) and in some decades (like the 1940's), 4-card majors were in fashion. Most of my readers (assuming Bob Hamman is not one of my readers), favor 5-card majors. The only time we might open 1-MAJ with 4 is in 3rd seat and in that case it would typically be a chunky suit such as KQJ9.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |

So, for this article, we presume 5-card majors. Let us get one of the tricky side issues out of the way: What to do with a 5-card major and a 5 or 6-card minor. For example, let's examine the opening bid with the following hands:|

There are differing opinions on how to handle 5-5 in the black suits. Some espouse starting low with 1@C and hoping to bid spades twice to show 5-5. |

These days, most players prefer to start with 1@S (to make sure they get their five-card major introduced while the auction is still low enough). There is no right or wrong'each way has pluses and minuses.|mb|1s|

With 6-5 in the blacks, most players would bid 1@C to start, and then hope to be able to bid spades twice. Still, there are some who prefer starting with 1@S (not many, though).|mb|1C|

It is a bit different with red suits. Opening 1@D and then trying to bid hearts will often lead to "reversing." For example: 1@D-1@S-2@H is a reverse showing extra values. But, in no case should you ever open 1@D with 5-5 in the reds. Start this hand 1@H, planning to jump shift in diamonds.|MB|1H|

This hand is strong enough to open 1@D, then bid hearts twice. That would show 6 Diamonds and 5 Hearts. With the same shape and only 11 HCP, I'd recommend starting with 1@H.|

I concur. If you open 1@H with hand C), for example, and partner responds 1@S, what would you rebid? There is no good rebid (because rebidding 1NT shows 12-14 and rebidding 2NT shows 18-19). I prefer to get it off my chest the first time and open 1NT to show 15-17.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


ht|m|AT|

Might we miss a major-suit fit? Yes. But even when we do, it's possible notrump plays just as well. Do I always open 1NT with a balanced hand and a 5-card major? Almost always. Exceptions: With 5-4-2-2, I prefer to open in the five-card major. Also, I try not to be too extreme. |
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


ht|p|AT|

Hands A,B,C are fine 1NT openings, but I'd draw the line at D). That hand looks so "hearty" and lopsided that I think 1NT would be inappropriate.|

If you want a general rule, I'd say, open all 5-3-3-2 hands in range with 1NT, unless the doubleton is two low ones.|

^-|cs||fp||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|This is a rather large topic, that I will summarize as follows:

You must decide whether a new-suit 2-level response is Game-Forcing. If so, then a 1NT response is Forcing (or maybe semi-forcing). The 2/1 system will be covered elsewhere in this series.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


AT|

The only 1-level response that can occur is 1@S over 1@H. This shows 4 or more spades. With 4 spades and 3 hearts the ^*B"general"^*N rule is this:|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


AT|

If you have only one bid to make, then raise the hearts. If you plan on bidding more than once, show the spades first, then raise hearts. Notice the quotes around "general." This is not etched in stone.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |

^*BNormal Raises^*N: The raise to 2-OF-A-MAJOR is typically 6-10 in support. Those using a forcing notrump typically choose to define the raise as 7-10 in support. ^*BIn standard, a raise to 3-OF-A-MAJOR is Limit (invitational)^*N. The "book" says it shows 4 trump, but I don't mind if it is done with 3 trump. ^*BA raise to 4-OF-A-MAJOR is weak, usually 5 trumps and about 0-8 HCP.^*N |cp|8|AT|

^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|I very much disagree that you can make a direct limit raise with 3-card support. Whenever you make an immediate limit raise (whether or not you play Bergen raises) you should have 4-card support. The 9th trump is very important. If you have 10-12 and 3-card support (e.g. you have a 3-card limit raise) you should make another bid first and then jump in opener's suit. If you play forcing NT, you would bid 1N and then jump to 3 of the major over opener's rebid. If you play 1NT non-forcing then bid a new suit and jump to 3 of opener's suit.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


AT|

^*BOther Raises^*N: These days it is fashionable to use other artificial raises. Some use Bergen Raises. If you do, be sure you and your partner play it the same way (there are many variations), and make sure to discuss passed-hand bidding and interference.|

The ^*BJacoby 2NT Convention^*N is popular. Click here |CP|1|AT|^*Hlarryco.com/BridgeArticles/ArticleDetails.aspx?articleID=45^*N|CP||AT| for my article on that convention. If you play Splinter Bids, be sure to discuss whether 1@S-4@H is a splinter or Natural (otherwise, be prepared for a train crash). Also, be sure to discuss whether 1MAJ-3NT is artificial (some play it as 4-3-3-3 with 3 trump, 13-15 and stoppers in all side suits; others play it as a "good raise" from 1 to 4).|

^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|Make sure you know whether 1@H-2@S is strong or weak. Play it the same way as your partner! Also discuss any other jump-shift responses (is it weak, strong, or conventional)? Without partnership discussion, don't risk making such bids.|
