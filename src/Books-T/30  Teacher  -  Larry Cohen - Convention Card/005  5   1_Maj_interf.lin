^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|In this new series (updated and revised from the previous decade), I want to take the reader through the ACBL Convention Card. I will give my advice on what conventions are important, and which are not. My opinions reflect 25 years of writing and teaching and are aimed at the intermediate level.  This series is not for beginners and not for National Champions. Anyone in between will hopefully benefit from my thoughts.|

I am very much in the KISS (Keep It Simple Sweetheart) School.  I believe that focus on declarer play and defense is much more important than adding a fancy convention.  If a convention is hard to memorize I will not endorse it. If it is highly artificial, I will say NO. If it doesn't come up much, it shouldn't be in your arsenal. The only conventions I will endorse, must meet all three of these requirements:|

^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|In this article, we discuss what happens when the Opponents interfere after our side has opened 1@H or 1@S. 

We will start with their overcall. If you want to sound modern, you can refer to these auctions as "in comp." That is short, of course, for "in competition". And that means the opponents (darn it!) are in our auction again.|

If the cue-bidder has the "or better" he bids again after opener tries to sign off.|

The top experts are implementing a treatment that is gaining in popularity. When a 1@H or 1@S opening is doubled, they are using a convention that has many different names; I call it BROMAD (more in a moment). After 1-MAJ (DOUBLE) :|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


AT|

A raise to two of the major is very weak ' about 3-7 points in support and 3-card support.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


AT|

A bid (artificial) in the suit 1-under is a better raise'about 7 -10 points in support.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


AT|

So, After 1@H (Double) :
2@H=A lousy (preemptive-type) raise with 3 trumps [with 4, you'd bid 3@H]

2@D=A legitimate raise with 3 or maybe 4 trumps (7 to 10).|

ht|m|at|^B@2Both of these actions are alertable, of course. Marty Bergen developed this idea in the 1980's and named it Bergen Raises Of Major After Double (BROMAD). In recent years, the idea has been expanded so that all bids starting with 1NT (after they double 1-MAJ) are artificial. 1NT shows clubs, 2@C shows diamonds, etc. The one-under bid is still a good raise, and the direct raise is still weak. This "expanded Bromad" is sometimes called "transfers after opponents' takeout double."|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||
%%%
qx||HT|B|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||cs|6|at|This expanded version is spelled out here:

After 1@S (X): {Similar schedule after 1H is doubled}

1NT = clubs. Could be just a club suit, or might be CK Q T 3 intending to later raise spades (while getting in the club Feature first'maybe to direct the opening lead, or to help partner evaluate his hand for competing in spades).

2@C=Diamonds. Again, could be just diamonds, or might be a spade raise with diamond cards.

2@D=Hearts. (Heart suit, or a spade raise with heart cards).

2@H=One-under ' so a good raise (7 -10)

2@S=Bad raise.

Again, my WARNING! Do not try this at home (unless you just love to toy around and get into trouble). To read about one of my most embarrassing moments (showing the dangers of BROMAD), click this |CP|1|AT|^*Hlarryco.com/BridgeArticles/ArticleDetails.aspx?articleID=77^*N|CP||AT| link.

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|What Larry Cohen recommends is very reasonable and if you want to base your bidding on his recommendations that if fine. And whether or not you want to use his "BROMAD" treatment is up to you. But I use a different method for raising partner that I feel is easier to remember and just as effective.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


AT|

Over a double, I play Bergen Raises are still on. Assuming you play Reverse Bergen, say the auction starts 1H-dbl-?. If responder bids 3@H that is a weak jump raise, 0-6 with 4-card support, 3@D is 7-9 with 5-card support. 3@C is 10-12 with 4-card support. Since Jordan 2NT is no longer needed to show a 4-card limit raise, I use 2NT over a takeout double to show a 3-card limit raise.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


AT|

If you want to limit Bergen Raises in competition to auctions where an opponent makes a takeout double, that is fine. But I also play Bergen is on with some other auctions. If the auction starts 1@H-2@C-? or 1@S-2@C-? I still play Bergen Raises are on. So 3@C, 3@D, and a jump raise to the 3-level still have the same meanings as if there was no 2C overcall. Also, if it goes 1@H-1@S-?, I play Bergen Raises are on. Again 3@C, 3@D, and 3@H retain the same meaning as if there were no 1@S overcall. I also now play 2@S shows a 3-card limit raise.
