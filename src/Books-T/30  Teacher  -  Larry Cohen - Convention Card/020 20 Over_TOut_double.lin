^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|In this new series (updated and revised from the previous decade), I want to take the reader through the ACBL Convention Card. I will give my advice on what conventions are important, and which are not. My opinions reflect 25 years of writing and teaching and are aimed at the intermediate level. This series is not for beginners and not for National Champions. Anyone in between will hopefully benefit from my thoughts.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

I am very much in the KISS (Keep It Simple Sweetheart) School. I believe that focus on declarer play and defense is much more important than adding a fancy convention. If a convention is hard to memorize I will not endorse it. If it is highly artificial, I will say NO. If it doesn't come up much, it shouldn't be in your arsenal. The only conventions I will endorse, must meet all three of these requirements:
^cNot highly artificial;
^CEasy to remember and play;
^cComes up frequently.|

That said, I will touch on EVERY convention listed on the ACBL Convention Card.  I will downplay the "ones to do without" and fully explain those to "do with." |

For one, he can pass. This doesn't say he has (or don't have) support. It just shows a weak hand, usually about 0-6 (but it could be more).|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


AT|

Another choice is to redouble. The common meaning of a redouble is 10+ HCP.  After this redouble, all further doubles would be for penalty. Some partnerships play the redouble denies support for partner, but I don't feel strongly in this matter.|

^-|ht|c|fp||at|^b@2What about actions other than a pass or redouble?  Let's start with a minor-suit opening such as:|

PG| ***** 8 ***** |


ht|g|at|^b@2What if East bids a suit? Usually, he will have less than 10 HCP (because he could redouble with 10 or more HCP)--but he actually could have more than 10 (sorry if that is confusing). For example, with:|

ht|i|at|^b|ih|pSA K 8 6 5H3DQ J 8 6C 6 5 4,|ht|i|at|^K@2 I would bid 1@S over the double. I'd rather start to describe my suits than to redouble and risk the auction getting too high. After I bid 1@S to show my spades, I'll do something later to show my strength.|

at| If instead I held, say,|
ht|k|at|^k|ih|pSA Q 7 6HK QDJ t 9 8CT 4 3,|ht|l|at|^s@2I could redouble and hope to penalize the opponents.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


ht|p|at|^B@2So, when East responds with a suit bid instead of redoubling are his bids forcing? |
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


AT|Most players treat 1-level suit bids as forcing. I want to be able to bid 1@S on the hand above left and not worry that partner will pass! A 1NT response after a double shows 6-9, balanced. |
PG| ***** 13 ***** |

ht|s|cs|6|at|^B{|ia|1hx2c|at|}|ht|s|at|^m{|ia|1sx2h|at|}|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


ht|v|at|^B@2Most agree that 2-level bids after a double are natural and NOT forcing.  Since you can redouble with 10 HCP, a 2-level response is assumed to be less than 10 HCP. For example, on the first auction, East could have this hand:|

^-|ht|c|fp||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|It has become "standard" to use a jump-raise after a double as weak. So, in this auction:|

The raise is weak (less than 7 points in support). After a major, it shows 4-card support. After a minor, 5-card support. With an actual limit raise (or better), East can bid a conventional (Jordan) 2NT. More on this below.|

Be sure to discuss what a jump in a new suit shows. For example in :|

^-|ht|c|fp||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|Surely, there are other ways to play. Many tournament players use transfers after the double (see my humbling story on this |CP|1|AT|^*Hhttps://www.larryco.com/bridge-learning-center/detail/77^*N|CP||AT|).|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


AT|

Also, most experienced players use 2NT as conventional. The most common meaning is "JORDAN" -- it shows a limit raise or better (this is typically used only after a major-suit opening).|

AT|

^b@2When using this method, a redouble of 1@H or 1@S surely denies 3-card support (else you'd respond 2NT). There are many other expert treatments available after a takeout double.|

qx||cs|6|fp|1|ht|a|at|^-{          APPROACH BY HOWARD SCHUTZMAN            
AFTER TAKEOUT DOUBLES}
^-|ht|E|fp||AT|^B@2^*BMM: What Cohen recommends over takeout doubles is very standard, and it is fine if you choose to play it. But Howard finds that many students find Cohen's suggested treatment somewhat confusing. Cohen says that if you bid a new suit at the 1-level that is forcing but if you bid a new suit at the 2-level it is not forcing. That seems very counter intuitive to Howard.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


AT|

What Howard suggests is that any bid other than redouble or 2NT denies 10 points and is not forcing. Thus 1@D-dbl-1@S is not forcing. Nor is 1@D-dbl-2@C. The only way to force and show 10+ points is to redouble or bid 2NT. 2NT is "Jordan" showing a limit raise or better in opener's suit.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


AT|

One other point. In Cohen's example, he makes a Jordan 2NT bid with 3-card support to show a limit raise. That is not standard. Many people play that 2NT guarantees 4-card support. With 3-card support you redouble and raise to 3 later.^*N|

Larry's Articles(The one hereferred to earlier).
Be Social: Active Ethcs  number 2
Author: Larry Cohen Date of publish: 02/01/2004 Level: Intermediate

One of my favorite teaching/story deals features this hand:

@ST 8 7 3
@HQ 8 2
@D
@CK Q 9 8 7 2

Many years ago, playing with Marty Bergen in a major event, I held the above cards. Marty opened 1@D and RHO doubled.

I considered Pass or 1@S, but instead decided to show my club suit. I bid 2@C.

Ooops. Marty alerted. He took my bid as conventional. He was right. I had forgotten our methods. This was one of Marty's (many) brainchilds called BROmAD. Instead of showing clubs, I had shown 7-10 points and 4+ diamonds! At least I had the 7-10 points.

Now what? I prayed. It didn't work. Marty jumped to 5@D! Bury me, why don't you.

RHO doubled. What should I do? Should I run?

Here is the point of the upcoming article. I MUST NOT RUN! To do so would be unethical. Can you understand why?

I am NOT ALLOWED TO BE WOKEN UP BY MARTY'S ALERT. When I bid 2@C, I thought I was showing clubs. I must ignore the fact that he alerted and explained it as diamonds. (Even had he not explained it, I am not entitled to all of a sudden "remember".) Let me repeat: When I bid 2@C, I thought I had shown clubs. Armed with that information, my partner jumped to 5@D. Who am I to overrule him? I still have what I've shown. I showed clubs, I had clubs. Removing to 6@C would be taking advantage of the alert.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This is a hard concept to understand, but most inexperienced players would fall from grace and run from the impending disaster.

Before I show you a new deal with this theme, I will tell you that the above story had a remarkable ending. You can read about it in Points Schmoints, or hear the full story at one of my lectures (sorry for the tease).

Now, on to this deal from the 2007 Nationals.

My RHO, Daniel Levin, held:

@SQ T
@HA J 5 4 2
@DK
@CQ T 8 7 6

With neither side vulnerable, he saw a 1@D opening by David Berkowitz. This was a Precision diamond--could be short. It is important to discuss with your partner if you treat such a 1@D opening as anything special. Is 2@D still Michaels? Daniel elected to bid 2NT, unusual. This showed the 2 lowest unbid suits--clubs and hearts.

His LHO (that would be me) doubled, penalty-oriented. Daniel's partner chose 3@D.

What's that? Partner didn't choose one of Daniel's 5-card suits. He must want to play in diamonds. Maybe he has 6 or 7 of them. Daniel's singleton king is actually good support. RHO doubles. Everyone passes. The lead is made and you table your dummy.

Now, as Paul Harvey would say, for the "rest of the story".

After Daniel's 2NT, I asked what it showed. Some players, especially over a Precision diamond, choose to use 2NT as minors (as opposed to clubs + hearts). Daniel's partner answered: "I think 2NT shows the minors."|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT|^B@2

Do you see the difference? Daniel now had (unauthorized) information that his partner was interpreting 2NT as minors. When his partner bid 3@D, Daniel knew that he was choosing between clubs and diamonds. He also knew that 3@DX was going to be a total disaster.

But, he did the proper thing. Review the thinking before you knew the "rest of the story." You bid 2NT, thinking you were showing clubs + hearts. Partner then, for whatever reason, chooses diamonds. End of story. Who are you to overrule him with your ordinary hand? Sure, if you were 7-6, you would be entitled to try something else. But, not with this hand. The ethical (and correct) move is to pass and take your medicine.

The medicine was a bottom. (Partner was 3-3 in the red suits and went for a huge number, whereas 3@H would have been down only two tricks). But, Mr. Levin earned my respect. He did the right thing.

Incidentally, had he unethically removed 3@DX, the director would have been summoned and would have had an easy time ruling the contract back to 3?X, anyway. That's the rules of bridge. You are not entitled to take advantage of "unauthorized information".

I know this is a complex matter for newer players, but it is a lesson worth learning.|
