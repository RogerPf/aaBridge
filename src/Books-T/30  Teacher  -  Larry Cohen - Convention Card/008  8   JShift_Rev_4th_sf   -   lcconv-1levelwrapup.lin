^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|In this new series (updated and revised from the previous decade), I want to take the reader through the ACBL Convention Card. I will give my advice on what conventions are important, and which are not. My opinions reflect 25 years of writing and teaching and are aimed at the intermediate level. This series is not for beginners and not for National Champions. Anyone in between will hopefully benefit from my thoughts.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |

I am very much in the KISS (Keep It Simple Sweetheart) School.  I believe that focus on declarer play and defense is much more important than adding a fancy convention. If a convention is hard to memorize I will not endorse it. If it is highly artificial, I will say NO. If it doesn't come up much, it shouldn't be in your arsenal. The only conventions I will endorse, must meet all three of these requirements:
^cNot highly artificial;
^CEasy to remember and play;
^cComes up frequently.|

That said, I will touch on EVERY convention listed on the ACBL Convention Card.  I will downplay the "ones to do without" and fully explain those to "do with." |

So, opener's jumpshift is a huge bid, showing almost a strong 2-bid. Not only is it forcing (partner cannot pass), but it is forcing all the way until game is reached. |

The only way to stop short of game is if responder breaks system and just decides to pass, maybe because he has responded with a 2-count or the like.|

^-|cs||fp||va|4|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N^*N|cp||at|This can be a complex subject. "What is a reverse?" Technically, there are several ways to describe it, all of them confusing. Here is one way to define a reverse:

a nonjump bid by opener at the two-level in a new suit that ranks higher than the suit opener bid first. Also, this applies only if responder's bid was on the 1-level. Ugh! Better to look at a few example auctions of a reverse by opener:|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Before his examples and to expand Cohen's definition of a reverse further, let me define it as follows:

^*B1)^*N Opener makes a bid in a new suit that is higher than bidding his original suit at the 2-level. For example:|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


HT|l|cs|6|at|^B{|ia|,1dp1sp!2h|at|}|HT|l|at|^L@2This auction is a reverse because 2@H is higher than 2@D.|

HT|p|at|^B{|ia|,1dp1sp!2c|at|}|ht|p|at|^L@2But this auction is not a reverse because 2@C is lower than 2@D.|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


HT|t|at|^B{|ia|,1dp1sp!2s|at|}|ht|t|at|^L@2Also, the auction on the left is not a reverse. Although 2@S is past 2@D, 2@S is not a new suit. It is simply a raise showing a minimum opener (13-16 Bergen dummy points) and 4 (occasionally 3) spades.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


HT|x|at|^B@2^*B2)^*N Opener must be able to bid his original suit at the 2-level in order for it to be a reverse. Thus, if it goes 1@C-P-1@S-2@D-2@H, 2H is not a reverse because 2C was not available as a bid. However, if it goes 1@D-P-1@S-2@C-2@H, 2@H is a reverse because 2@D was available as a bid.|

Such a bid shows extras. Why? Because if the responder now were to go back (take a preference) to opener's first suit, he would have to go up one more level (to the three-level). Opener had better have a good hand to survive such a preference. How good?|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
A reverse shows at least 16-18 playing points. I won't get into how to add for distribution at this point. Suffice to say, that the modern-day treatment is to count extra for long suits. Add for short suits, only after a trump-fit has been established.|

A reverse is forcing'responder "cannot" pass. However a reverse is NOT forcing to game. Note the difference between a reverse (which shows extras and might be a huge hand) and a jumpshift which guarantees a powerful hand and is game-forcing.

^-|fp||ht|c|va|6|at|^B@2If the responder rebids his suit, it shows 5 cards and is forcing one round, but not to game. For example in this auction:|

ht|h|va|5|at|^b{|ia|,1dp1sp2hp2n|at|}|ht|h|va|5|at|^k@2If the responder bids the cheapest new suit (or 2NT if that is cheaper), he is showing a weak hand. He can pass opener's next bid. (2NT bid in this auction shows a weak hand'the responder can pass opener's next bid).|

HT|p|at|^B@2Notes: There is confusion (rightly so) over other "reverse" auctions. For example, in this auction,|

ht|q|va|4|at|^b{|ia|,1hp2cp2s|at|}|ht|q|va|4|at|^k@22@S is a "reverse?", but does it show extras if playing that 2@C was already GF? There is no universal answer, but I say that in a 2/1 GF auction, there should be no such thing as "reverses" -- i.e., they don't show extras. |

^-|fp||ht|c|va|6|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Reverse auctions are complicated because the reverse does not establish a game force. Sometimes responder must take charge of the auction and make sure their side gets to game. Sometimes opener must take charge and make sure their side gets to game. And sometimes neither partner has enough to force to game.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


AT|

Cohen's system of the cheapest of 2N and the 4th suit as indicating that responder has a weak hand that cannot force to game is played by many. But it is flawed in my opinion because it forces responder to make an artificial bid that may get your side too high when, in fact, you want to stay low. I play what I feel is a much sounder, more natural, and easier to remember system. It is described fully in my movie on reverses
|CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=reverses^*N|CP||AT|.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


AT| 

In summary, it works like this:

1. The only way for responder to force to game is to bid the 4th suit (analogous to 4th suit forcing). Any other bid by responder is not game forcing. If responder does not bid the 4th suit, and opener has a hand strong enough to force to game (18+), then it is up to opener to take charge and force to game.

2. The partnership cannot stop below 2NT.

How strong a hand? I recommend playing it as a game force. This means the responder has at least opening-bid values (he knows that opposite his partner's opening bid there is enough combined strength for game). Examples are next.|

NT|^B@2
In each of the three auctions above, what if responder had a game-forcing hand with either hearts, spades, or clubs? In all cases he'd start with 2@D to set up the game force. On his next turn (he had better get one!) he clarifies his intentions with a natural (forcing) bid.|
