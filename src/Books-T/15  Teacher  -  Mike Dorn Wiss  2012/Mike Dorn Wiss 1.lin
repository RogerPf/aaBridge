sk|e|nt||mb|2D|at|M_DornWiss: 2@D - the suit is meaty enough; the hand value is a dead minimum not vulnerable. The trend today is to bid more than when I started umpty ump years ago...|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||sk|s|mb|p|at|
M_DornWiss:  had east passed south would bid 1NT forcing in 2/1 but not so in SAYC
north would rebid 2@C and south would have a choice between 3@C and 2@H

on the actual aution the 2@D bid makes it tough for south to find an action
no bid really fits, a neg X is out because no 4 @S's
so the pass is my choice as well|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


sk|w|nt||
mb|p|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


sk|n|mb|d|at|Opener has an easy X to balance with
opener CAN rebid 3@c, but X is better
In effect it is a take out of 2@d
north's "balancing" double is also a "takeout" double
it is a takeout in balancing position|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||at|
Karen10: 3@c would still be strong jump shift points..even in pass out seat?
M_DornWiss:  On this hand there has been interference (2@d) over the 1@h opening. Now a 3@c bid by opener is no longer a jump.
It can be made on a dead minimum if responder has shown values (such as with a negative double), and with as little as 15-ish ( a point above a minimum 11-14 range) if responder has passed over 2@d.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||at|
In either case opener has "shape", meaning a stiff or void in overcaller's suit and 9+ cards in the rounded (@h + @c), and "no interest" in defending 2@d or 2@DX (since no pass or double instead). Both double and a cue-bid would show extra values and/or shape, with ensuing bids defining the handtypes closer.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||at|
If there is no interference and after the 1@H opener responder bids 1NT, in my opinion opener is borderline between a 2@C and a 3@C rebid. 
There are "only" 15 HCP but that hand resembles 15 about as much as I resemble Angelina. In actuality it is worth 18+.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||at|
In a natural system a jump shift rebid by an opener shows 18 up to just under an initial 2@C opener. 
I define a 2@C opener as 22+ if the hand is balanced or 9+ tricks in a suit-oriented hand if the suit is a major or 10+ tricks if the suit is a minor - in other words, a hand within a trick of game and one which requires no more than a high card control (an ace or king) by responder to make game a good proposition.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||at|
Therefore a jumpshift by opener says "we are now on a game force no matter what you hold, as my 18+ and your 6+ (or 5 if it includes an ace or a king) is enough of a total holding." 
A 2@C rebid in a standard and natural system has a very large range - from the minimum to open (11) up to 17 (just under a jumpshift). |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt||at|
Here, the X is the most FLEXIBLE bid
The way I value north's hand is thus:
15 hcp + 1/2 for each Ace  + 2 or 3 for the @D stiff - the latter only when a fit is found|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||at|
total 18 1/2 to 19 1/2
If you check the kaplan-ruben hand evaluator ( here is the link:  ^*Hwww.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi^*N|at| ) the results are very similar
so north has a great hand
moonjohn: as norths x is a balancing takeout, now can south bid 3@C ?
M_DornWiss: and MIGHT make a game try should south choose a 3@C rebid  (I would)|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


sk||nt||at|
on this hand were the @SK with the overcaller a 5@C game would be a good spot
|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


sk|n|nt||at|
MarilynLi: how many points are needed for the dbl by opener generally? or just need shape?
M_DornWiss: good question marilyn
Shape is most important, with shortness in the overcalled suit. But some minimum hands should be passed out and defended.
There are a lot of view-points on this topic and it is much too time consuming for now :) Mike Lawrence on balancing will be a good place to educate oneself|

M_DornWiss: ok - 1st - south had a 1@D opener - nowadays you cannot win (or even compete) unless you open any 11 count that includes 2 aces or defensive tricks (like a KQ)
After the pass and 1@H opener by West, north had an easy takeout X, which left south with a problem
(I just got a private message which contradicted my statement of an 11 count to open
and said 12.) 
That is ancient history|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt||
at|When Fred and I played we actually played the roth-stone system where we routinely passed "ugly" 14's in 1st & 2nd!
Nowadays you MUST open "good" 11's so long as they hold 2 defensive tricks or superb shape with 1 1/2 tricks

South's 3@D was now a bit of an underbid - perhaps a cue-bid of 2@H first would show a pip under an opener|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt||at|
Even over 3@D north should not have raised, as the hand was a minimum double in the 12-14 range 
- no extras, no extreme shape

The only POSSIBLE game might be 3NT IF south had a @H stop
Now I know that wasn't the actual case, but south did not have a "real" pass at first|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt||at|
M_DornWiss: now to the 5@C bid:
Since @D was the agreed suit, the only real reason to bid another suit (as a cue-bid) on the way to 5@D is as a SLAM try!
so here's a hand that originally passed which is now sniffing for slam :)
it happens... :)|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt||at|
M_DornWiss: the interesting thing is that 5@D is not a bad game
Had east's @C doubby be Jx or Tx 5@D would make!
The correct way to play the @C suit is to cash BOTH honours from the south hand 1st
Usually is it right to cash them from the hand short in length
Had the J or T dropped south could then finesse the 9 to make 4 @C tricks and 11 in total :)|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt||at|
M_DornWiss: after a 1@D opening and a 1@H overcall, north has a fine 2@H cue-bid
South would have nothing to rebid but 3@D (which north might now raise to 4) 
and that would be the final contract
Any Questions?|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt||at|
moonjohn: souths hand has 8 losers is that still ok to open in 2nd seat?
M_DornWiss: indeed|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


nt||at|
cruzer:  what does the cue-bid 2@h say?    1@d - 1@h - 2@h
M_DornWiss: a cue-bid of an opp's suit says:
1) I have a great holding in context with likely very good support for your suit (too good to merely raise)
2) it is forcing
3) it usually promises a rebid
Partnerships must make their own agreements whether cue's show or ask for stoppers in the opps suit - it depends - and again would take too long here|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt||at|
firsty: would you consider East opening 2@S?
M_DornWiss: east's hand is TOO weak for 2@S, although I HAVE seen good players do exactly that
I do not approve
This is a PARTNERSHIP game, and we play bridge, not poker here :)|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


nt||at|
robzim: I did consider it -- but it breaks all the rules I tell the Beginning Bridge students :)
It doesn't meet any of the requirements --no 6 points and not enough high cards
FM75:  5 of top 8 :)
Karen10: 6 of top 13...|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


nt||at|
M_DornWiss: the problem is that responder will ALWAYS misjudge the potentials of both offense and defense if there is not a minimum suit and point quality to the bidder
May I say:
In 3rd seat, not vul vs vul, after 2 passes....ANYthing goes :)
I would open 2@S with KQTxxx and out not vul, that is my personal minimum.|

M_DornWiss: ok - I'm going to pass you all two pieces of very valuable general advice that will apply to millions of hands, so please bear with me!
In the bidding:
south's rebid of 1@S was what I call an "RCA" bid - lemme explain:|
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


nt||at|
M_DornWiss: remember ye old RCA Victor logo with the white dog listening with cocked ear to the gramophone?
(yes, I'm old - 68 on the 2nd)
The logo said "his MASTER'S voice"
to ALL of we humans, the voice we love best is our own
so I call RCA bids "bidding to hear one's voice"|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


nt||at|

^*Hwww.sw-em.com/rca_nipper.jpg^*N|at|  (for the younger amongst us)|
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


nt||at|
M_DornWiss: let's examine why I think 1@S was RCA:
south had a MINIMUM hand
The only 2 reasons to rebid FREELY (when RHO sticks in a call) is:
1) extra values   or 2) extra SHAPE|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


nt||at|
M_DornWiss: therefore, with a flat minimum (like a weak NT 12-14ish) - a PASS let's partner know:
1) you are minimum and 2) you are balanced
Therefore a BID says EITHER I have extras, OR I have SHAPE|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


nt||at|
FM75->Kibitzers: Would having 14 cards be extra shape? :)
M_DornWiss: 14 cards would definitely qualify
Fijukeit: I'll have one of those please
M_DornWiss: pour me a double|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


nt||at|
M_DornWiss: so here 1@S showed at least 4 cards in @S, but guaranteed longer @C and shortage elsewhere|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


nt||at|
RedCat08:  Did I have a bid in second seat with my shape?
M_DornWiss: west had the SHAPE for a mikey's* bid, but NOwhere near the strength
Now if west were NOT vul AND NS WERE vul, many players would not resist a mikey's chirp
red vs white: my pard's can depend upon KQT8x, QJT9x at the WORST

*Michaels cue bid
|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


nt||at|
M_DornWiss: back to my advice - when you have bid your hand, and shown your values, do NOT bid them again (unless forced by pard's cuebid or similar situations|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


nt||at|
M_DornWiss: 1@D auto - now to east's 1@H
First, I have some admiration for this bid! It is a very tuff hand
Some partnerships play 2@C as this type of suit, but most do not and are "stuck"
granted east does not have a 5 card suit, but it is a GREAT 4 carder, and now is the only chance to show "stuff" when a Double is equally impossible|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


nt||at|
M_DornWiss: sometimes one has to 'bend" just a bit, and 'lying" by only a pip is better than lying about a moose of a hand!
I confess I too would bid 1@H

South should PASS 
and west will raise|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


nt||at|
M_DornWiss: Now, if north also has a major suit and is good enough to "reverse" (will have at least Limit Raise values), the major fit could still be found.
It is normal for a responding hand (when in the 5-9 hcp range) to bypass a longer @D suit in order to bid a four card major. 
This allows the partnership to find major fits early and to explore for games, etc. Therefore, when responder holds more hcp's (10+) the @D suit is bid first, intending to bid the major on the next turn.
(i.e. bidding the @d's does not DENY a major)|
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


nt||at|
In effect, responder is "reversing" the normal order and thereby showing higher values. 
As an example - 1@C - 1@D; 1NT - 2M. Opener is balanced and has a weak NT value - 11-14 - else would have opened 1NT with 15-17; responder is unbalanced with a four card major and five+ @D's and has 10+ hcp's. 
Therefore the partnership is "safe" at the three level (or 2NT) in either opener's or responder's minor.|
pg| ***** 94 ***** |


nt||at|
The 2M bid is forcing in that case and opener must make a rebid over it, either raising the major if they have four, or rebidding their own minor, or supporting responder's minor, or rebidding NT.

Now to my other piece of general and important advice:|
pg| ***** 95 ***** |


nt||at|
M_DornWiss: Like a marriage, bridge partners must:
1) TRUST each other
2) make things EASY on each other
3) COMMUNICATE|
pg| ***** 96 ***** |


nt||at|
FM75:  was 2@H too timid by West?
xfco: W  couldn't bid the weak freak ? 
M_DornWiss: west's hand was worth 7+ in support of @H's - values for 2 @H but shape for 3
anyone have a 2 1/2 @H card?|
pg| ***** 97 ***** |

pg| ***** 98 ***** |


pc|H5|
pg| ***** 99 ***** |


pc|HK|at|M_DornWiss: when east led the @H Ace at trick 1 west played the 3
- east must TRUST partner's @H 3 and SWITCH
Whether to switch to the @SK or @CA and another @c is a guess imo, but continuing a @H EVEN IF IT WORKS - is showing mistrust - try that with your spouse and see what happens :)|

M_DornWiss: this is a very good lesson hand!
Despite the minimum values and a "quacky" hand I agree with the 1@H overcall
the negative X by east is "auto"
the 3@H call by south is obviously meant as preemptive - and just does fit that despite the defensive trick|
pg| ***** 124 ***** |


nt||at|
M_DornWiss: 4@C is also a good bid
and 4@D is fine as well - (cannot cue 4@H as that would imply good @C fit)
back to west|
pg| ***** 125 ***** |


nt||at|
M_DornWiss: I confess on this hand I would be in a slam (and likely down 1!)
xfco: I thought about it
M_DornWiss: I would cue 4@H
Although this would not "light up" east with the wasted @HK and MAYbe A (west might have a stiff @H)|
pg| ***** 126 ***** |


nt||at|
M_DornWiss: 5@H exclusion is a BIG overbid because it forces to a small slam and invites a grand with NO knowledge of a @C fit or help
Over 4@H east MIGHT show the @CK with 5@C on the way to 5@D (I would choose to do so)
NOW west (or moi) would just hop to 6@D with the unannounced @S control|

pc|D3|at|M_DornWiss: Eddy found an excellent trump lead
with any other lead slam is easy
because ALL the trumps are high but for the ace|
pg| ***** 128 ***** |


nt||at|
M_DornWiss: West can win any other lead, play a @C to the K, ditch the @S and a @c-loser on the 2 top @H's, and lead a @C to the Ace.
When that lives BOTH the losing @C's can be ruffed hi in dummy
and you only lose the @d Ace|

South needed to continue Eddy's good work and lead a second trump, then only 1 loser can still be ruffed|

mb|p4Hppp|at|M_DornWiss: I like (most) of this auction - I think the 1NT overcall is preferable to 2@D - with a @H less and a @D more is a real difficult choice - perhaps still NT at matchpoints but @D at IMPs
|
pg| ***** 152 ***** |


nt||at|
M_DornWiss: I like 2@S by south - with 9+ X is best to "punish" the overcaller, but with less - another important thing in the game: SUPPORT with SUPPORT
Now to west :)  a tuff hand with which to compete
Only 6 hcp but a hand worth 9 if overcaller has 3+ @H's|
pg| ***** 153 ***** |


nt||at|
M_DornWiss: I know west 'meant' 3@D as a transfer
But in this auction 3@D is both natural and forcing
showing a 5+ suit and 10+ points|
pg| ***** 154 ***** |


nt||at|
The way to play in @H's is to use the Lebensohl convention where 2NT (by west) is a relay to 3@C (by east)
Which responder can pass or correct to another suit to play there at the 3 level
It allows competition on many hand types where interference makes it tuff to find a meaningful bid
Here the fit was there and game was basically on a @H hook through the opening bidder - not bad|
pg| ***** 155 ***** |


nt||at|
M_DornWiss: I like north's 3@S competitive rebid
the hand is worth 16 when south supported @S
and the 6th @S is necessary for the call
all in all a pretty well done hand by everybody, this is stuff I love to see by learning players :)|
