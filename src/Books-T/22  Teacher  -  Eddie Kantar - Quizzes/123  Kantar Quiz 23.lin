at|^i@2^Z@3Eddie learned to play bridge at 11 and by the time he was 17 he was teaching professionally- and still is! He often took his bridge books to junior and senior high school, hiding them beneath his textbooks. One of his instructors was so impressed with his "study" habits that he mentioned it in class, causing Eddie to sweat bullets fearing the teacher would come a little closer and see "Reese on Play" superimposed over the history book he was supposed to be studying.|

ht|L|va|4|at|^B@2At the high school level many of the girls who had boyfriends in college found out that Eddie played bridge and begged him to teach them the game. He did, with high hopes in mind, but the minute they thought they knew how to play, he never heard from them again. At the University of Minnesota where he studied foreign languages (now he can enjoy bridge books written in French and Italian),  he taught bridge and sold football souvenirs to pay his tuition.

|ht|p|at|^B@2Eddie Kantar's bridge wisdom combined with his wit makes reading his popular books a learning experience (at any level) as well as a true pleasure. He is one of the best known bridge writers in the world. He has written some 25 bridge books, some available in CD-Rom form, and is also a regular contributor to the ACBL Bulletin, Bridge World, Bridge Today, and OKbridge. A two-time World Champion, Eddie is highly regarded as a player, and he competes regularly on the National level.  He is known as one of bridge's great ambassadors. 

This presentation is based on ^*BBidding Quizzes^*N by Eddie Kantar using Howard Schutzman's Viewer App. It has 240 Bidding Problems divided into several sections. In this section we have:

ht|h|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|True. The 5@C response to regular Blackwood ask shows 0 or 4 aces (Nowadays most play Key Card Blackwood with different responses).

ht|H|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|False. There are various responses to show a void, but counting the void as an ace is not one of them.

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|True. The strong hand usually does the asking, the weak hand, the telling.|

^*BWhen the Blackwood bidder first bids 4NT and then 5NT asking for kings, the responder can leap to seven without answering for kings.|ht|d|cs||at|^kQuiz 5 - by Eddie Kantar|hf|j|lb|*m^True~False^1|
ht|H|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|True. If the responder can count 13 tricks, he should bid the grand. It is assumed, of course, that the 5NT bid guarantees joint possession of the four aces.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Basically the same thing is true when playing Roman Keycard. Responder should jump to 7 if he can count 13 tricks. 5NT guarantees your side has all 5 key cards and the trump queen (or a 10+ card fit).

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|True. Say the Blackwood bidder has two aces and a void and gets a one ace response. He may not know which ace partner has.

ht|H|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|False. If the previous bid was 1NT, 2NT or 3NT, a follow up bid of 4NT by partner is [natural], not Blackwood--[quantitative].
