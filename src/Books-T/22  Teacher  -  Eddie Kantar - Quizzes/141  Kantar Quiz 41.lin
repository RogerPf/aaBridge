^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|My first serious partner and lifelong friend was and is Marshall Miles. Nobody I have ever met loves the game of bridge more than Marshall. Marshall has written some of the classics in bridge literature, is a National Champion many times over, and well known for his theories and imaginative bidding. Everybody, including Marshall's partners, have to be alert at all times! 

Things are not always what they seem to be when Marshall is at the table. Here's your chance to test your bidding skills against those of Marshall Miles.

You are South and you are playing rubber bridge. |

^B@2^*BMarshall Miles: ^*N|cp||at|I bid 3@H. A good suit and a reasonable amount of controls on the side. A jump will be necessary to reach slam if partner has  @Sxxx @HQx @DAJx @CKQJxx |

^B@2^*BMarshall Miles: ^*N|cp||at|4@H. We may or may not make this one. Partner should not have an ace on the side, but he may have the @CK or a singleton club. 3NT would be dangerous since we are missing three aces (I was sure Marshall was going to bid 3NT).|

^B@2^*BMarshall Miles: ^*N|cp||at|3@H. Unless I rebid the suit, partner can't very well support the suit with a doubleton honor and a single diamond stopper. If he now bids 3NT, I can pass with confidence. |

^B@2^*BMarshall Miles: ^*N|cp||at|I Pass. Game is unlikely so I pass in the safest partscore contract. (I thought Marshall would bid 2@H).|

^B@2^*BMarshall Miles: ^*N|cp||at|I Dbl. At this level a double simply shows high cards. If partner has a balanced hand, he should pass. If he is distributional he can bid knowing I have high card strength.|

^B@2^*BMarshall Miles: ^*N|cp||at|I bid 2@D. Since I hope to bid all three suits, I do so in the normal order. With a weaker hand I might bid 2@C planning not to show the diamonds unless partner bids them first.|

^B@2^*BMarshall Miles: ^*N|cp||at|I Dbl. I have as good a defensive hand as partner can reasonably expect. His redouble shows a good defensive hand.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|I think 3@H would have been a limit raise at the time this was written. |

^B@2^*BMarshall Miles: ^*N|cp||at|I Pass. If I raise, partner may take a sacrifice for one trick too many. Or he may double. When my hand is this weak, I believe in staying out of the bidding so as to avoid a disaster. (Good advice-wish I had taken it more often).|
