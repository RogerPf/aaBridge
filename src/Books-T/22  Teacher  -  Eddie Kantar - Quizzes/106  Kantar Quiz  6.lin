^Z      }|HT|f|AT|^e@2All About Eddie Kantar - A Must Read from |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.kantarbridge.com/index.htm^*N|CP||at|^b@2^Z@3Eddie learned to play bridge at 11 and by the time he was 17 he was teaching professionally- and still is!  He often took his bridge books to junior and senior high school, hiding them beneath his textbooks.  One of his instructors was so impressed with his "study" habits that he mentioned it in class, causing Eddie to sweat bullets fearing the teacher would come a little closer and see "Reese on Play" superimposed over the history book he was supposed to be studying.

At the high school level many of the girls who had boyfriends in college found out that Eddie played bridge and begged him to teach them the game. He did, with high hopes in mind, but the minute they thought they knew how to play, he never heard from them again. At the University of Minnesota where he studied foreign languages (now he can enjoy bridge books written in French and Italian),  he taught bridge and sold football souvenirs to pay his tuition.

|ht|p|va|6|at|^*BMovie Maker^*N: Eddie Kantar's bridge wisdom combined with his wit makes reading his popular books a learning experience (at any level) as well as a true pleasure.

A two-time World Champion, Eddie is highly regarded as a player, and he competes regularly on the National level.  He is known as one of bridge's great ambassadors.

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Next are four bidding decisions from a National Championship in San Antonio. Let's see how you would have fared. Assume you are playing Matchpoints. You are always South and since you and partner have most of the high card strength, the opponents pass throughout. I know that in real life this never happens, but in this quiz it does.|

lb|*mWhich bid is the best?^2C~3C~2H~3H~2D~Any^6|NT|^B@2 
There are five possible rebids: 2@C, 3@C, 2@H, 3@H, and 2@D. Expert opinion varied as to which was best. However, on this hand the stronger the rebid the more likely you are to get a good result.|

NT|^B@2 
The way the cards lie, there is a grand in clubs, hearts or notrump, however just arriving at a small slam would have achieved a superior Matchpoint result.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|The winning action was to bid on. A possible forward going move is 4NT, quantitative, another possible move is 4@D helping partner to visualize that his long diamonds are going to be worth quite a few tricks or simply taking the bull by the horns and bidding 6NT. |mb|4n|

NT|^B@2 
I could have made it a little easier on myself by bidding 3@H over 2@S. Once partner confirms four card spade support it is much easier to bid the grand.|
