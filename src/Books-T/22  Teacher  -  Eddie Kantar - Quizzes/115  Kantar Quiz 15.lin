He often took his bridge books to junior and senior high school, hiding them beneath his textbooks. One of his instructors was so impressed with his "study" habits that he mentioned it in class, causing Eddie to sweat bullets fearing the teacher would come a little closer and see "Reese on Play" superimposed over the history book he was supposed to be studying.|

ht|l|va|3|at|^B@2At the high school level many of the girls who had boyfriends in college found out that Eddie played bridge and begged him to teach them the game. He did, with high hopes in mind, but the minute they thought they knew how to play, he never heard from them again. At the University of Minnesota where he studied foreign languages (now he can enjoy bridge books written in French and Italian),  he taught bridge and sold football souvenirs to pay his tuition.

|ht|p|at|^B@2Eddie Kantar's bridge wisdom combined with his wit makes reading his popular books a learning experience (at any level) as well as a true pleasure. He is one of the best known bridge writers in the world. He has written some 25 bridge books, some available in CD-Rom form, and is also a regular contributor to the ACBL Bulletin, Bridge World, Bridge Today, and OKbridge. A two-time World Champion, Eddie is highly regarded as a player, and he competes regularly on the National level.  He is known as one of bridge's great ambassadors.

{     TEST YOUR MONTE CARLO BIDDING     }

|fp|2|at|Each year in Monte Carlo on the French Riviera they hold a big money bridge pairs tournament,
over 300 teams entering. Prizes are awarded similar to golf tournaments.
In this particular event they paid down 30 places and the winning pair split $10,000.

The most prestigious event, however, is the knockout team of four.
Here are four problems from this event. 
The eventual winners were the Lancia team (Belladonna, Garozzo, Vivaldi, Forquet and Omar Sharif). 

If you make the winning bid on at least three of the following four problems,
you might have wound up in the money!  ^-|ht|w|fp||at|^B@2

It's right to take the sac. If partner would have had two defensive tricks he would have doubled. One opponent appears to have solid diamonds and the other solid spades. Partner's outside length figures to be in clubs.|

Partner's hand: ^i|ih|@S52  HAQJ2   D5  CQT8765 |at|

You are down four or five (five if they find the club ruff) and that is a good save against their 1430.
