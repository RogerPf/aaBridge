He often took his bridge books to junior and senior high school, hiding them beneath his textbooks. One of his instructors was so impressed with his "study" habits that he mentioned it in class, causing Eddie to sweat bullets fearing the teacher would come a little closer and see "Reese on Play" superimposed over the history book he was supposed to be studying.|

ht|k|va|4|at|^B@2At the high school level many of the girls who had boyfriends in college found out that Eddie played bridge and begged him to teach them the game. He did, with high hopes in mind, but the minute they thought they knew how to play, he never heard from them again. At the University of Minnesota where he studied foreign languages (now he can enjoy bridge books written in French and Italian),  he taught bridge and sold football souvenirs to pay his tuition.

|ht|p|at|^B@2Eddie Kantar's bridge wisdom combined with his wit makes reading his popular books a learning experience (at any level) as well as a true pleasure. He is one of the best known bridge writers in the world. He has written some 25 bridge books, some available in CD-Rom form, and is also a regular contributor to the ACBL Bulletin, Bridge World, Bridge Today, and OKbridge. A two-time World Champion, Eddie is highly regarded as a player, and he competes regularly on the National level.  He is known as one of bridge's great ambassadors.

NT|^B@2
Bid 2@S. Although partner will play you for a doubleton as it is rare to withhold three card major suit support, it is better in the long run to respond 1NT with a balanced 6 count than raise to 2@S which is a more encouraging  response.|mb|2S|

Bid 3@D. Don't count this as wrong if you didn't make this 'obvious' rebid! Just kidding. Many years ago the British writer, Norman Squire, suggested that in this sequence (and some similar ones ) where a jump in a new suit could not logically be natural, it should show a humongous fit with partner's last bid suit plus a control in the jump suit.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT|^b@2
He labeled the bid "The Out of the Blue Cue". Without that crutch at your disposal, leap to 5@C as a jump to 4@C would not be forcing.|mb|3D|
