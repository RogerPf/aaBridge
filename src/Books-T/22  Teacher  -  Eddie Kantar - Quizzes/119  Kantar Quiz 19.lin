He often took his bridge books to junior and senior high school, hiding them beneath his textbooks. One of his instructors was so impressed with his "study" habits that he mentioned it in class, causing Eddie to sweat bullets fearing the teacher would come a little closer and see "Reese on Play" superimposed over the history book he was supposed to be studying.|

ht|L|va|4|at|^B@2At the high school level many of the girls who had boyfriends in college found out that Eddie played bridge and begged him to teach them the game. He did, with high hopes in mind, but the minute they thought they knew how to play, he never heard from them again. At the University of Minnesota where he studied foreign languages (now he can enjoy bridge books written in French and Italian),  he taught bridge and sold football souvenirs to pay his tuition.

|ht|p|at|^B@2Eddie Kantar's bridge wisdom combined with his wit makes reading his popular books a learning experience (at any level) as well as a true pleasure. He is one of the best known bridge writers in the world. He has written some 25 bridge books, some available in CD-Rom form, and is also a regular contributor to the ACBL Bulletin, Bridge World, Bridge Today, and OKbridge. A two-time World Champion, Eddie is highly regarded as a player, and he competes regularly on the National level.  He is known as one of bridge's great ambassadors.

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|South should bid 3@S. 2@S is just a preference and usually shows 2-card support. 3@S shows a 3-card limit raise, which is what South has.|

PG| ***** 8 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|South should bid 4@S. As noted in the previous hand, 3@S is NOT forcing -- it shows a 3-card limit raise. Alternatively, South could bid 3@D (4th suit forcing) and then correct to spades. But 3@S is not correct as it only is invitational.|

Bid 3@D.  4th suit forcing. When the responder does not have a convenient way to limit a strong hand, he can fall back on the 4th suit which is considered artificial. It is a game force when made at the three level. |mb|3d|

Bid 3@H.  This one is played as not forcing by some and forcing by others. It should be discussed by the partnership. If played as not forcing it shows 10+ to 11 HCP with four hearts.|mb|3h|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|I don't know any SAYC players who play 3@H as forcing. It is invitational. With the South hand, South has a clear 4@H bid. South has 15 Bergen dummy points - 10 HCP, 1 length point, 2 quality suit points, and 2 points for the 2 doubletons.|

Bid 4@H.  The jump to game shows an opening bid with four hearts if 3@H is considered forcing then the jump to four shows concentrated strength in the two bid suits.|mb|4h|
