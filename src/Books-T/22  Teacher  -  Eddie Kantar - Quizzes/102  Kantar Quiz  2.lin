He often took his bridge books to junior and senior high school, hiding them beneath his textbooks.  One of his instructors was so impressed with his "study" habits that he mentioned it in class, causing Eddie to sweat bullets fearing the teacher would come a little closer and see "Reese on Play" superimposed over the history book he was supposed to be studying.

At the high school level many of the girls who had boyfriends in college found out that Eddie played bridge and begged him to teach them the game. He did, with high hopes in mind, but the minute they thought they knew how to play, he never heard from them again. At the University of Minnesota where he studied foreign languages (now he can enjoy bridge books written in French and Italian),  he taught bridge and sold football souvenirs to pay his tuition.

|ht|p|va|6|at|^*BMovie Maker^*N: Eddie Kantar's bridge wisdom combined with his wit makes reading his popular books a learning experience (at any level) as well as a true pleasure.

ht|l|at|^B@2
You bid 4@S. Your hand has improved tremendously on the bidding. Partner figures to have five or six spades.(If partner had four spades, he would have arranged a different auction). There is a likely slam here and you should indicate the strength of your spades; a raise in clubs, partner's second suit, would show four clubs.

You bid 3@S. You have already shown partner six hearts so now is the time to give partner a preference. A raise to 4C shows four card support and rebids of 3@H or 3NT are both off the wall.

ht|l|at|^B@2
You bid 4@D! You have to have talked this one over! The jump to 4@D announces a big fit with partner's last bid suit plus the ace of the jump suit.    It's a neat way of inviting slam showing while staying beneath the level of 4NT.  The leap is called the " an out of the blue cue".
