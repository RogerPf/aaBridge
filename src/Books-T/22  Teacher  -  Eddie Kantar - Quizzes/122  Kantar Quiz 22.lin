He often took his bridge books to junior and senior high school, hiding them beneath his textbooks. One of his instructors was so impressed with his "study" habits that he mentioned it in class, causing Eddie to sweat bullets fearing the teacher would come a little closer and see "Reese on Play" superimposed over the history book he was supposed to be studying.|

ht|L|va|4|at|^B@2At the high school level many of the girls who had boyfriends in college found out that Eddie played bridge and begged him to teach them the game. He did, with high hopes in mind, but the minute they thought they knew how to play, he never heard from them again. At the University of Minnesota where he studied foreign languages (now he can enjoy bridge books written in French and Italian),  he taught bridge and sold football souvenirs to pay his tuition.

|ht|p|at|^B@2Eddie Kantar's bridge wisdom combined with his wit makes reading his popular books a learning experience (at any level) as well as a true pleasure. He is one of the best known bridge writers in the world. He has written some 25 bridge books, some available in CD-Rom form, and is also a regular contributor to the ACBL Bulletin, Bridge World, Bridge Today, and OKbridge. A two-time World Champion, Eddie is highly regarded as a player, and he competes regularly on the National level.  He is known as one of bridge's great ambassadors.

Your bid is 3@H. You can't just sit there with this good of a hand. If you get doubled, you might consider running to your other suit.

Your bid is 4@H.  Much too good for 3@H which puts undue pressure on your partner. When you need just a little bit to make game, bid it yourself!

ht|l|at|^B@2
Your bid is 3@D. Ugh!  And  pray someone, anyone, bids something. If they do, bid 4@H. Making a takeout double with a singleton spade, an unbid suit, is a recipe for disaster. If everyone passes 3@D, don't call and don't write, I don't know you.

Your bid is Pass. Not strong enough to bid 3NT and double is for takeout. Pass and hope partner can reopen with a takeout double. N
