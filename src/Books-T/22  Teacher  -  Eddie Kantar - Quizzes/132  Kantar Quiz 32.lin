He often took his bridge books to junior and senior high school, hiding them beneath his textbooks. One of his instructors was so impressed with his "study" habits that he mentioned it in class, causing Eddie to sweat bullets fearing the teacher would come a little closer and see "Reese on Play" superimposed over the history book he was supposed to be studying.|

ht|L|va|4|at|^B@2At the high school level many of the girls who had boyfriends in college found out that Eddie played bridge and begged him to teach them the game. He did, with high hopes in mind, but the minute they thought they knew how to play, he never heard from them again. At the University of Minnesota where he studied foreign languages (now he can enjoy bridge books written in French and Italian),  he taught bridge and sold football souvenirs to pay his tuition.

|ht|p|at|^B@2Eddie Kantar's bridge wisdom combined with his wit makes reading his popular books a learning experience (at any level) as well as a true pleasure. He is one of the best known bridge writers in the world. He has written some 25 bridge books, some available in CD-Rom form, and is also a regular contributor to the ACBL Bulletin, Bridge World, Bridge Today, and OKbridge. A two-time World Champion, Eddie is highly regarded as a player, and he competes regularly on the National level.  He is known as one of bridge's great ambassadors.

^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*n  Before we start please note the following comment by Howard Schutzman:|
cp|8|AT|



^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most experts play that, after your overcall, a new suit by your partner 
^p  (who is called the "advancer") is ^*b NOT ^*n forcing. 

I disagree with this approach. 

The reason is that, if you play that, you cannot show a good hand as advancer. 

The expert solution is to use a cue bid to show a good hand. 

But I think you should treat bids by advancer the same way you treat bids by responder (partner of opener). 

It is simpler and more consistent. 

So I recommend you play new suits by advancer as forcing. 

And a cue bid by advancer shows a limit raise or better. 

However, as you will see, this Kantar quiz assumes a new suit by advancer is not forcing.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|You probably need to make a bid. Keep the following in mind:
2@C is not forcing and denies three spades. A jump in response to a one level overcall is invitational (some play it forcing) and the only force is a 2@D cue bid. Not everyone plays this way, but you have to talk over even a simple sequence like this and come to some firm agreements.|
