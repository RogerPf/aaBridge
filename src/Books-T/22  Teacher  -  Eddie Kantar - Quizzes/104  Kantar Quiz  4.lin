He often took his bridge books to junior and senior high school, hiding them beneath his textbooks.  One of his instructors was so impressed with his "study" habits that he mentioned it in class, causing Eddie to sweat bullets fearing the teacher would come a little closer and see "Reese on Play" superimposed over the history book he was supposed to be studying.

At the high school level many of the girls who had boyfriends in college found out that Eddie played bridge and begged him to teach them the game. He did, with high hopes in mind, but the minute they thought they knew how to play, he never heard from them again. At the University of Minnesota where he studied foreign languages (now he can enjoy bridge books written in French and Italian),  he taught bridge and sold football souvenirs to pay his tuition.

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|One doesn't always pick up good hands. Sometimes one has to make do with one like this. You are sitting South playing IMPs with both sides vulnerable. How would you handle this lovely hand given the following 6 sequences?|mb|1sxp?|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


nt||lb|*bWhat would You bid with this hand?^^2c|NT|^B@2
Bid 2@C. It's not for you to reason why, it's for you to do or die. Bid your cheaper four card suit and hope for the best.|mb|2c|

Pass. You are off the hook after the redouble. It is up to partner to rescue himself. Bidding a minor suit at the two level after a redouble suggests a 5 card suit, exceptionally a strong four carder.|mb|p|

Bid 2@D. Partner's double is for takeout and you are taking it out. Bridge is a simple game.|mb|2d|

Bid 4@C. The other choice is 5@C, a bid you might make if your king were in another suit, any other suit. Partner figures to have 10 or 11 black cards with more clubs than spades (possibly 5-5) and there are no words to describe a "pass" at this point.|mb|4c|

Bid 4@H. Having passed partner's 1@H opening bid, you could hardly have more. Besides, there is a double fit - always good for taking mucho tricks offensively. Go for it!|mb|4h|

Pass. Your partner has announced a hand as strong or stronger than the opening bidder. Believe it or not, you have nothing to be ashamed of. Your side probably has as many or HCP than they do and partner is on lead.  If you remove partner's penalty double of one notrump, you announce a weak hand with a five or six card suit.|mb|p|
