He often took his bridge books to junior and senior high school, hiding them beneath his textbooks. One of his instructors was so impressed with his "study" habits that he mentioned it in class, causing Eddie to sweat bullets fearing the teacher would come a little closer and see "Reese on Play" superimposed over the history book he was supposed to be studying.|

ht|k|va|4|at|^B@2At the high school level many of the girls who had boyfriends in college found out that Eddie played bridge and begged him to teach them the game. He did, with high hopes in mind, but the minute they thought they knew how to play, he never heard from them again. At the University of Minnesota where he studied foreign languages (now he can enjoy bridge books written in French and Italian),  he taught bridge and sold football souvenirs to pay his tuition.

|ht|p|at|^B@2Eddie Kantar's bridge wisdom combined with his wit makes reading his popular books a learning experience (at any level) as well as a true pleasure. He is one of the best known bridge writers in the world. He has written some 25 bridge books, some available in CD-Rom form, and is also a regular contributor to the ACBL Bulletin, Bridge World, Bridge Today, and OKbridge. A two-time World Champion, Eddie is highly regarded as a player, and he competes regularly on the National level.  He is known as one of bridge's great ambassadors.

^*BTakeout. West had a takeout double of 1@S, so his hand couldn't have changed during the bidding. He still has a takeout double, only a strong one, a very strong one.|

ht|m|at|^B@2
^*BTakeout.  Doubles of opening bids of 4@C and 4@D are for takeout. Most play that a double of 4@H is also for takeout, but there is no agreement as to what a double of 4@S means. Most play it as a penalty double. Something to talk over with your partner.|

ht|m|at|^B@2
^*BTakeout. After partner makes a takeout double and responder raises, a double by 4th hand shows "two places to play", an effort to land in the right trump suit. East probably has both minors and wants to land in the right one. For example:
@S84  @HT87   @DKJ54   @CAT87|
