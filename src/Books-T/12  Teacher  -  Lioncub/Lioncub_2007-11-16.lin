^d @H@2Lioncub’s bidding session is held every Friday in the BIL at noon NY time. 3 Hands @e@3are bid with 4 volunteers and then change. Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play…….or both. Feel free to ask any questions that are bridge related.

^d @e@2In this presentation we have combined the movie of the hands from lioncub's Friday @e@3Teaching Session with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed version of chat log transcript.  

The emphasis is presenting to you lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  We did not focus on correctness of the grammar or the spelling.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. Further, all the links in this file are clickable - it turns blue when you move your cursor over it.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site.

@D@D@D  Please note that with each board you will see the four hands and the auction after Allan has asked for a "Lead and Claim." The claim is meaningless and is made so the bidding critique can begin.  @D@D@D|

AT| VFTowers: Why not bid the 4 card club suit. |
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: Careful defence will beat it by one.........but as I said ......too dangerous for S to bid at the 3 level. 3@C doubled by the way goes for 300 points.|

lioncub: Should S make a bid over 2@H? The answer is no.  However, spirited players would bid 3@C. Disciplined players would pass. Again no right or wrong. |

BUT..........it is a very good suit.|

NT|^B@2^Z@3lioncub: Correct lead.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: All biddings are  correct until the 2nd bid by North. By that bid North says, "partner I do not trust you to have your bid."  2NT is a 100% losing bid.  questions? |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


AT|
sooki6847: So that was penalty dbl? |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: Of course.  Can be nothing other than penalty after bidding 1NT. Once a player has bid NT.....after a bid by partner........any subsequent double is penalty. It is mandatory for him to pass.|

PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3lioncub: bidding nearly right.
		1@H-2@C
		2@D-?
IT IS PERFECTLY correct to show second suit. nOw Jimmy should bid 3@H.........showing 10-12 points and exactly 3 hearts which N will pass . note the sequence of bids by South. never jump with just 3-card support.........make a waiting bid in a minor first........and then biD 3 of the major. You can even bid the minor with just 3 card suit. Questions? |
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3scarlet310: Could it not South opened with 1@c ? |
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: No. And can someone tell me why not. It does not follow Rule 20. Also with the 4/3/3/3 hand.........deduct one point. |

AT|^B@2^Z@3lioncub: 2@D shows club support with 10+ points. The bid was technically correct...........but I prefer 2NT which shows the full value of the hand. |

AT|
lioncub: One spade opener is correct..........note the "stuffing." So sorry to be critical. BUT the 2@D bid is as bad as it gets. It is a poor suit with 3 losers possibly. Has defensive tricks in all other suits.  The  only one bid to ever consider would be  ....PASS. |
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


AT|
South also should pass.  However, as the biddings went Lisa should bid cue bid 2@S showing  good support of 3 small opposite a 2 level bid and 10+ points. |
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT|^B@2^Z@3My bidding:
1@S-p-1NT-p
p- 2D-p  -p

Note after pass of NT by North then W who is marked with points and is in different situation now can bid 2@D.|
