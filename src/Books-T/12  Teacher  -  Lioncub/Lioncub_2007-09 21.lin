^d @H@2Lioncub’s bidding session is held every Friday in the BIL at noon NY time. 3 Hands @e@3are bid with 4 volunteers and then change. Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play…….or both. Feel free to ask any questions that are bridge related.

^d @e@2In this presentation we have combined the movie of the hands from lioncub's Friday @e@3Teaching Session with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed version of chat log transcript.  

The emphasis is presenting to you lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  We did not focus on correctness of the grammar or the spelling.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. Clicking the first will move you forward and clicking the second will take you back. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. 

Further, all the links in this file are clickable - it turns blue when you move your cursor over it.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site.




Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

lioncub: Although West at fourth seat is just short for Rule 15 (it is 14 and not 15), the 2 nice 10s make it worth while opening…..albeit a bit aggressive.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


at|
lioncub: East........?  3@C is NOT  wrong  but I prefer 2NT. It shows  balanced hand.......points in all suits.......and 11/12 points.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |

lioncub: 1@S-?  We are playing SAYC.......not 2 over 1. The  hand is too good for 1NT.
My bidding would be:
^C1@S-2@D 
^C3@C-3@S
^C4@S|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt|
lioncub: 2@D is perfectly good bid over 1@S which  promises 5-card suit and 10+ points.
DavidVan: Does East's second bid of spades promise 6 cards?
lioncub: He would not rebid spades.......he should bid 3@C over 2@D........showing 17+ points.
lioncub: clear everyone?|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt|
analisals: Do you need that many points to always bid a 4 card suit at that level?
lioncub: yes
lioncub: 1@S-2@D 
              3@C......promises 17+|

lioncub: First my question to the Kibs and then the point which I would like to tell you all.  What should be the opener’s bid?|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


at|

Several Kibs suggested  2@C and others  2NT to which Allan responded.|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


At|

lioncub: You all are wrong except  David who bid it correctly. The point is,  “IF PARTNER CANNOT BID OVER 1@S THEN YOU WILL NOT HAVE MISSED GAME.”|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|
lioncub: Next tip on this hand. In balancing seat..........that is East...........NEVER balance with a 3-card holding in opponent’s suit.  This is a rule that will pay dividends more often than not.  Other bids were fine.  Good redouble by David showing the extra strength.  Geoff  after not bidding on the first round used his 3 trumps and a doubleton and made a good raise.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


nt| 
lioncub: My bidding, however, would be.........1@S.......followed by 3 passes.  BTW I say don’t open 1NT with 5-card major........but yes to 2NT opener with 5-card major.
 
gene_k: Ahh then a 2NT would have been good also?
lioncub: Nope .....not with small doubleton @D.|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


pc|H9|mc|13|nt|
lioncub: Lead… correct suit but wrong card. Partner should have 4 hearts for his double, so lead a heart……but lead the correct card which ps the 8@H.

Next board please.|

Dianne0516: Should West have opened using  Rule of 20?   
lioncub: good point Dianne.  Yes he should open using Rule of 20...plus 2 aces and a king. The bidding should be.
    ^C1@D-1@S-P-P
    ^CX-p-p-p |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


Nt|gene_k: Then, in that bidding sequence isn't it correct to double the 1@S as; 1@d-1@S-X-?  ?|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


at|
lioncub: A double of 1@S would NOT be a penalty double……..but……would be a negative double showing the 2 unbid suits. Therefore, the correct action for East is to pass and pray that partner will reopen with a double....It is mandatory for the opener to do this………EXCEPT …….when holding 3 or more cards in the opponents suit.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


at|
lioncub: I invite you all to study take out and negative doubles and Rule 20. Look them up in my web site ^*H www.zyworld.com^*N.  Even when partner opens..........a  double of an intervening bid......IS ALWAYS TAKE OUT unless of course partner has opened 1NT.|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|
Rule of 20 determines whether you can open a hand based on combination of HCPs and good distribution. Add HCP  to  the number of cards in 2 longest suits, if answer is 20 or more....open. There we had 11+5+4=20. You can use Rule 20 in any seat. |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


At|

Dianne0516: Allen--Do you need most of the hcp in the two suits to open Rule of 20 ?|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |

lioncub: Yes, Dianne........good point again. |

lioncub: 2@D overcall was a bit poor...........but have seen worse.  Pass by Jimmy is ok. Now, to the bid by East. First of all that 2@S bid promises a 5-card GOOD SUIT. Remembering that it was made in response to partner's overcall.........not to his opening bid.|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


at| 
lioncub: I want you all to give some thought to what East should bid.....BUT DONT CALL OUT. Partner has made an overcall of unknown strength and East has 3-card support and 10+ points. You will get the answer on the next panel.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|
lioncub: The answer of course is cue bid 2@H showing  10+ points and 3-card support. Please remember this.......it comes up every week. You show support with which  partner would be free to bid any number of diamonds.......which will be under 9 points. So if West overcalls with 2@D and North passes.... East bids 2@H. Diamond fit is now established. West now would sign off in 3@D.  Note any change of suit by West would be invitational. South, however, of course would either double the 2@H bid by East or even bid 3@H. |

lioncub: Once again...........very well bid.  South is too good for just simple preference bid of 2@S. Excellent.  2@H bid shows no more than a minimum opening bid with 5 spades and 4 hearts. |
