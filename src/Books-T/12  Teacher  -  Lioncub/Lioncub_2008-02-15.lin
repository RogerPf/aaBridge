^d @H@2Lioncub’s bidding session is held every Friday in the BIL at noon NY time. 3 Hands @e@3are bid with 4 volunteers and then change. Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play…….or both. Feel free to ask any questions that are bridge related.

^d @H@2What  :|CP||AT| For my later review I like to have a BBO movie representing lioncub's teaching session as close @e@3to the live event as possible. I am delighted that you can also enjoy it.|cp|8|at| 

How  :|CP||AT| In this presentation I have combined the hands from lioncub's Friday Teaching Sessions with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed and edited from the chat. He has approved the bridge information in this movie. You will see the four hands and the auction by the participants and after Allan has asked for a "Lead and Claim." The claim is meaningless and is made so his critique can begin. |cp|8|at| 

Goal :|CP||AT| The emphasis is to present lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  Incorrect grammar and spelling are tolerated. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. All the links in this file are clickable - they turn color when you move your cursor over them.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site. |FP|2|AT|

The buttons at the bottom of the page have their usual BBO functions. Use them to move around in the movie. An explanation window will pop when you move your cursor over them. Further, anywhere in the movie, you can click the |cp|8|at|^*B HELP^*N |cp||FP|2|at|box at the right lower corner of the screen to launch BBO's help section. |FP||CP|8|AT|
 

Please help me improve these movies by sending suggestions to kiaaziz@@yahoo.com.|CP||FP||AT|

                                               
                                              Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

Should North open 2@D? I say no due to the outside ace...........but a lot would,,,,,,,,,,,and I would not argue if you did. Now, let us look at the bidding as is: P-1@H-X-?
West should MAKE IT AS HARD AS POSS FOR OPPS TO KNOW WHAT TO DO. REMEMBERING THAT IN COMPETITION.........DIRECT RAISES ARE ALWAYS WEAK. Using THE LAWOF TOTAL TRICKS............the right bid here is not 2@H........but 3@H.  Over either, N should still be bidding at least 4@D making it  hard for E to stay out of game.|

lioncub: Don't forget this is in competition.........you have 9 card fit.....so bid to that level....i.e. to the 3 level. This is the LTT -the law of total tricks.|

^B@2hateshinai: Why doesn't E open, it has exactly 26 ZAR points perfect minimum 1@H bid.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: We don't use Zaar points........we use rule of 20.  We do know that if you have a suit with  a 10/9 combination with a higher honour,,,,,,,then you add one point. Sooooooooooooo E has 10HCP + 1=11. Therefore using rule of 20 East can then open. |

^B@2lioncub: Correct lead.
Now, look at this wonderful hand by E.  I love 6/5 hands. Open 1@c -9HCP +6+5=20. 6-card suit before the 5-carder. My bidding:
1@C-P-1@D -P
1@H-P-1NT-P 
Both N and S MUST pass at first time of bidding.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT|
^B@2Please learn this lesson well............IF YOU HOLD THE ENEMY SUIT........ALWAYS PASS INITIALLY THEN double. However as the bidding progresses it should be obvious to S that there must be  a spade fit and should advance to game in spades.|

minette309: I always thought u must have 7 tricks & 9 points to bid a 3 bid.|

lioncub: A good 3 bid is QJ10to 7 with a singleton or void................that is only 3 points.|

Opening bid of 1@S is correct. South cannot bid at the 2 level with under 10 points or a very good 9 ..........write that in stone. The only bid available is 1NT. The bidding will go:
1@S-1NT
2@C-2@H
The 2@H bid shows a 6-card suit..........and is usually drop dead.|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt|
^b@2lioncub: However with a 6-card spade suit......rebid 2@S would be acceptable  which will be passed out.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


aT| 
lioncub: Let's go over it again. When partner opens a major...........and you do NOT have 10 points..........then the only bid available is 1NT. Then, partner bids his second suit............2@C. I am suggesting that NOW you can bid 2@H to show your 6-carder which should be passed. However with a void in hearts.......partner rebids his spades.......as it was a 6-carder.|

^B@2lioncub: Safe lead. Now, note the opening bid of 1@D. This is the only hand that you open 1@D with 3-card suit, a 4/4/3/2 hand. After the bidding sequence of
1@D-1@H-
2@H-?     there should be hand evaluation.......hearts agreed suit.........so add points for shape. Add 3 for the singleton.  Therefore 3@H is correct. And we have a good disciplined pass by South.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT| 
^B@2lioncub: On the other hand as one of the kibs mentioned East should have opened 1@C using Rule 20. In that case, it would be different bidding entirely as:
1@C-X-1@H-p 
1@S-P-2@S-p-p-p |

dkgrab: Why not 2@H by east so west can bid 3nt?|

lioncub: 2@H by east would be 4SF.......DENYING HEART STOP........and asking partner if he has one. Bidding was perfect. |
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT|
^B@2But, someone just pointed out that South has opening bid and yes she has. Why? NEVER OPEN WITH A 11 POINT HAND THAT DOES NOT SATISFY RULE OF 20...........UNLESS WITH A HAND WITH 2 ACES AND A KING................THEN YOU OPEN.|

After the very brave interference  with only a doubleton heart South should pass the 2@S bid. In fact that is exactly what the pass shows. South, however with 3 card support.........should bid 3@H. LESSON FOR TODAY.............DON'T BE AFRAID TO COMPETE........wont always get it right BUT. On the other hand, on the first round  West could have bid 2NT showing 5/5 in minors -CAPP.|
