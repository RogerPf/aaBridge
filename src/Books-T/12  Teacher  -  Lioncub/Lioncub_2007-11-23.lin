^d @H@2Lioncub’s bidding session is held every Friday in the BIL at noon NY time. 3 Hands @e@3are bid with 4 volunteers and then change. Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play…….or both. Feel free to ask any questions that are bridge related.

^d @e@2In this presentation we have combined the movie of the hands from lioncub's Friday @e@3Teaching Session with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed version of chat log transcript.  

The emphasis is presenting to you lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  We did not focus on correctness of the grammar or the spelling.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. Further, all the links in this file are clickable - it turns blue when you move your cursor over it.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site.

@D@D@D  Please note that with each board you will see the four hands and the auction after Allan has asked for a "Lead and Claim." The claim is meaningless and is made so the critique can begin.  Clicking the forward arrow will take you to the next board.  @D@D@D




Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the page.|

azin: Could E bid 3NT outright?|

lioncub: No. As the bidding goes, 1@D-1@H-1NT, W denies 4 hearts and 4 spades. So 2NT was perfect as an inquiry.|

lioncub: 1D-1H-X-?  1@H is a bit marginal..........but not terrible. Double shows the 4-card spade suit. Well done. PLEASE PLEASE WHEN PARTNER MAKES OVERCALL............IT SHOULD BE SHOWING STRONG SUIT. Therefore you must support with 3-cards. Remembering our rules for competitive bidding. All direct raises show under 9/10 points.  3@H would not be out of order with this vulnerability. You might buy the contract with 3@H.|

lioncub: Correct opening bid as was the overcall of 3@H. An overcall of a weak opener must show at least a strong opener. W should trust partner and bid 4@H. BUT failing to do so N  committed the cardinal sin. Don't bid your hand twice. There is nothing extra to add and all the 4@C bid did was to give opps another chance to bid game. And they after saying thank you very much.|

lioncub: Bad lead............4 to the jack is nearly always wrong. Heart lead is safest.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


AT|
lioncub: 1@H_?  N will bid 3@H with next bid showing 10-12 points and exactly 3-card support. Now to S. Ask yourself this question, "Has my partner's bid of 1@S made my hand better or worse?" The answer is worse. Singleton support is not an asset. To amswer one of the Kibs any points in the N hand in spades opposite a singleton is  wasted points. South should  show strong hand with jump bid of 3@C.|

lioncub: Correct lead. How do you bid these big hands?  21 points sitting over the opener. Give the opener at least 12. Now you get 33 if you add your 21 and 12. So there are 7 points between other 2 hands. My advice is to bid as if they are split. Therefore double first and then bid 3NT. Questions? |

lioncub: I am going to keep this very short. The situation is similar to previous hand. You got 19 points this time under the opener. 19+12-31. Therefore just 9 points between the 2. Take your share of half, say 4. Therefore you have 23 points between the 2 hands. Thus, you should only compete for a part  score. And do this by bidding your very good suit - bid 2@D. The rest is unimportant. |
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT|
I  specifically reserve the redouble to show extra in points. Here the extra was in length. So the correct bid over double or 2@D  would still be 2@H. AND OLD MAXIM IS THIS. GET YOUR FIRST BID WRONG AND IT IS HARD TO CATCH UP. To double a major will show at least 4-card support for other major UNLESS has very strong hand with own suit and need at least 17 points to bid like that.|

lioncub: Now after looking at four hands, Who wants to know the law of restricted choice? Here a small heart to the ace on which W plays the Q. The law of restricted choice by Terence Rees of Enland states that if W was dealt the Q and the J he could play either. However, if he has stiff Q he has no choice to play it. Therefore if he plays the Q then the J is more likely to be in the E hand and you should now play East for 3 to the J. Odds are 2 to 1 in favour of playing this way,,
