^d @H@2Lioncub’s bidding session is held every Friday in the BIL at noon NY time. 3 Hands @e@3are bid with 4 volunteers and then change. Once the bidding is finished, Lioncub will do a critique and then invite questions and comments. Do come along, the more the merrier. You can sign up for his weekly newsletter which gives tips on play and bidding. Private lessons can be arranged on a one-to-one basis to practice bidding or play…….or both. Feel free to ask any questions that are bridge related.

^d @e@2In this presentation we have combined the movie of the hands from lioncub's Friday @e@3Teaching Session with his critiques, questions and comments from kibitzers.  Those are a condensed version of chat log transcript.  

The emphasis is presenting to you lioncub's analysis of the biddings and the leads.  We did not focus on correctness of the grammar or the spelling.  ^$40   or  ^$6   boxes at the bottom of each page will help you to view the movie. When available there is an explanation for the bid in a gray box.  To see the explanation just roll your cursor over it. Further, all the links in this file are clickable - it turns blue when you move your cursor over it.  Simply click the link if you wish to visit the site.

@D@D@D  Please note that with each board you will see the four hands and the auction after Allan has asked for a "Lead and Claim." The claim is meaningless and is made so his critique can begin.  Clicking the forward arrow will take you to the next board.  @D@D@D

^d@h@h  Please do not miss our salute to Allan after board 12.  @H@H 


Good Luck. Please click the    ^$40  box at the bottom of the age.|

lioncub: Good lead.  1@D-? Here the hand is worth more than one bid........so show the 5-carder first. So it should go as:
^C1@D-2@C
^C3@C-3@S
Now, 4@S from N pinpoints the singleton heart. Next, start a cue bidding  sequence showing interest in a slam. The bidding should be 4@S-5@C; 5@D-5@H. Finally, 6@C shows the second round control and South should bid 6@S. PLEASE NOTE CAREFULLY ALWAYS USE CUE BIDS RATHER THAN RKC.|

lioncub: Not good choice for lead. Best lead is K@H.

1@D by opener is correct. W is worth a bid at the one level. Definitely 1@H. After 1@D-1@H-? N should bid 2@S over 1@H and South should bid 3@S. |

lioncub: Right suit........wrong card. The right card to lead is indeed the @S2. Overcall by North is based on shape........I definitely recommend the 2@H bid. 2@S by East was also correct.
Now to S hand. Has  9HCP.......PLUS points for shape as the suit is agreed. Add 5 for the void. So hand is worth 14 points and you should always bid game. Well bid all of you.|

lioncub: With good trumps..........lead long suit.........not short suit. Lead the 4@D.
1@S-2@H promising 5 hearts and 10+. Now sit with me in N seat. Partner has shown a 5 -card heart suit with 10+ points. HEARTS ARE NOW THE AGREED SUIT and my points are 15hcp+1+1=17. I would ignore the fact I have 6 spades (the suit is very weak) and therefore bid 4@H. On the other hand South is only worth an invite of 3@S. And 4@H makes.|

lioncub: Lead should be @SQ. Now to the bidding. Biggest lesson of the year. TAKE YOUR TIME BEFORE BIDDING............THINK OF THE OPTIONS. E in first seat with good 3-card suit in one major, and 3 in other major should PASS. However having opened, S makes the correct bid of 3@S showing 5-carder and promising a strong hand.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT|
You never bid weak over weak. Now to N? an 8-card suit would not keep me quiet. However having decided to pass E comes to the rescue and S makes the expert bid of doubling 4@C. THIS CANNOT BE PENAALTY..........WHY? COS PARTNER HAS NOT YET BID. Now over that double North should just bid 5@D with the fingers crossed. Please, look for this strength showing doubles........this is part of an advanced player's armory.|

lioncub: Lead is correct. The hand is too strong to open 3@H.  HCP are 10..............using rule of 20 add 7+4+10=21. However having opened 3@H. Now let's sit with E and think about it. You can't double. That implies 4 spades. Best option is  4@C showing the 5-carder. Now to what I think is assessing the points. I put equal share with opp and partner. East has 18 and opener has say 9. That is 27 and leaving 13 points between W and S. Now give partner 6. Together with your 18 is enough for game. Not ideal. BUT...........I think the best bid available is 3NT.|

lioncub: Lead from either black Kings is okay. Brilliant bidding. S too strong for simple overcall. So is right to double and then show hearts next. Then shows her singleton with a splinter bid of 4@D. Next is the magic bid by N........accepting slam try and shows the ace diamonds, Finally S finishes off the good work by bidding 6. Very well done.|

lioncub: Lead is correct.
lioncub: 2@C-2@D  Both correct. My suggestion is to always bid 2@D as waiting bid to hear from partner again. Then 3@C showing the very good 5-card suit.  Now what should W be thinking?  W should think that there must be a slam on probably in clubs. Best bid by W now is 4@C. This has gone past 3NT so has announced slam interest. Over 4@C, lets try cue bidding.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT|
^C4@C-4@D   (4@D = first round Diamonds control = ace or void)
^C4@S 5@H   (4@S and 5@H = first round Spades and Hearts control = ace or void) 
^C6@H-7@C   (6@H = second round Hearts control) 
Here is my suggestion. If you think that you may have a slam on then a cue bid (1st round control, i.e. the ace or void.) The cue bid shows INTEREST in a slam without insisting as Blackwood would. |

ht|g|fp|2|CP||at|^bAllan,

^B@H@2You have been our teacher, mentor and friend. With extraordinary patience, you have tolerated @e@3our improper bids and our intrusive chats before you even  had a chance to start your critique.  You carefully instilled years of bridge experience into beginners and kept repeating things until even the slowest of us finally understood. You were so dedicated to your teaching that you even taught us on your birthday.

We all worked hard and tried to do our best, hoping to get a “job well done” or an “excellent” or a “Brilliant” from you. Therefore, for all that hard work and dedication to teaching your students, we salute you and wish you and your family a happy new year filled with love and joy and good health.

                                                                    YOUR STUDENTS|

lioncub: Once E opens.............W wants to be in game.......but what game? 1@D-1@H and 1NT are correct so far.  Now W knows that there is no 4/4 spade fit as E did not bid 1@S over 1@H.  E should have doubleton heart to bid 1NT. In any case just bid your hand, 3@H and let E choose. 3@H is 99% forcing and shows the 6-card suit. and asks partner with doubleton honour or any 3 small to bid 4@H. Without either of those 2 holdings E would bid 3NT. |

lioncub: 1@D-?   GET YOUR FIRST BID WRONG.......AND BE IN TROUBLE LATER. North can't bid 2@C....under 10 points.  2@D would imply 4 or more diamonds. 1NT looks wrong. So there is no perfect bid..........here you must make a choice as to the best bid available. My choice would be 2@D rather than 1NT, However over 2@C South has just one bid to make.......and that is 2@D. W cannot overcall with such a weak spade suit. N would safely pass 2@D. |

lioncub: Lead is fine. Bidding is fine up to 2nd bid by W.  The bid should be 2@S instead. Please  note the vulnerability. One off doubled for 200 beats any part score by NS. The void  does not give W any extra tricks. Further, W should not open 2@S because  he has 3 cards to an honour in the other major. He was correct to pass as opener and come in later.|
