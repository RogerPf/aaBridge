at|Peter Brennan: The purpose of this course is to acquaint you with some useful tools when you declare a hand. Hopefully, by seeing a number of examples in random order you'll recognize these situations when they pop up in your game.  

Each hand features a common challenge of some sort:  dealing with bad suit breaks, handling tricky entry situations, making inferences from the bidding or play, counting enemy distribution and/or points, when to draw trumps, basic end plays, etc.

These hands should be played using IMP or rubber bridge tactics.  Don't even think of risking the contract to make a measly overtrick or two.

Good try by our volunteer!  Too bad the finesse was off.  Now let's look at all four hands.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


at|
If you remember the chances of both the key Kings being offside is only 1 in 4, so this was a particularly evil development for our declarer.  Despite this the contract can make 100% of the time. But it's not easy to see that right away.|sk||
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


at|
One common theme of all the hands we've seen is the necessity of picturing the opponent's hands to make a successful plan. To begin we should duck the first @h to see how the suit splits.|
pc|hhh|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|
When East shows out on trick 2 we know @hs are 5 - 1.|
pc|hQhc2|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|To guarantee the contract, all we have to do is extract West's @cs and give him his 4 @hs tricks.  Then he's ENDPLAYED.|

West must lead now (it's in the rules!!).  Our 9th trick will come from either a @s or a@d.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


mc|9|sk||sc|y|nt|The lesson text:  Many declarers will spend time and energy trying to determine whether to finesse the @s or @d for their 9th trick. The winning line is much simpler.  Remove West's safe exit cards (@cs) and give him his @h tricks.  West will return the favor, giving us our 9th trick by leading a "pointed" suit.|

The @hs are likely 2 - 5. You have 3@ds, 1 @c and 2 @hs = 6 tricks.  @s, @d and @c each offer chances for additional tricks. The order which you test these suits could determine success or failure in this contract.  Good luck!|PC|H9|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


at|
There are two important cards held by the defense, the @sA and the @cK.  If West has either one we will make the contract, provided we tackle the suits in the right order.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


at|
It's a mistake to play @s first. West could win the @sA and lead a second @h, allowing East to clear the suit. Later, East could gain the lead with the @cK and cash 2 more @hs for down 1.  Does everyone see that?|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|The @c finesse offers the better chance.  If it wins, we then switch to @s to insure 9 tricks.  (2 @ss, 2 @hs, 3 @ds and 2 @cs)  And if it loses and East establishes his @hs we must hope West has the @sA so East will have no entry.|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


at|
This is a basic principle of good bridge play. When there are two plays needed to establish suits and you hold one stopper in opps long suit, PLAY INTO THE DANGEROUS HAND FIRST.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


at|
Our hope is the not-so-dangerous opp, when he gets in, will be unable to get to his partner as is the case here. So should we take the @c finesse right away?|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


at|
The answer is "no", because we'd go down if East held both the @cK and the @sA when ^*Bthere was a decent line of play we didn't try^*N.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|The way to give us the most chances is to test @d first.  If they split 3 - 3 (36%), we can just play @ss to knock out the Ace.  We don't need the @c finesse at all.  We'll have 2 @ss, 2 @hs, 4 @ds and 1 @c.|

If we find @ds are not 3 - 3, it's important to be in our hand for the @c finesse.  Once again, we shouldn't lead @s first for the reason given earlier.|

Now we can claim 9 tricks...|mc|9|sk||sc|y|at|
Here's the lesson text:  There are several ways to develop tricks in this hand.  West may have the @cK or @d may divide 3 - 3 (36%).  To try everything, test @ds first.  If they split 3 - 3 (36%), knock out the @sA for 9 tricks.  If the @ds don't split, take the@c finesse before playing @s.|

pg| ***** 36 ***** |

This layout requires the @ds split 3 - 3 to make.  If we try the @c finesse and then @s, down we go since greedy East has both key black cards and 3 good @hs.|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


at|
But we do not know yet of this unlucky distribution. And since there is an other decent line of play, we have to try it first. We must test the @ds.  If they're 3 - 3, we'll take 2 @s, 2 @hs, 4 @ds and the @cA for our 9 tricks.|

West, for his @h overcall, is marked with both the @hA and @cA.  This puts you at risk of losing 2 @cs and 2 @hs. Can you eliminate one of these losers?  Good luck!|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


at|
West made a 2-level vulnerable overcall based on a suit that is probably headed by the AQ or AQJ.  The only other cards of interest are the @cA and the @dK.  All agree?|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


at|
East must hold the @dK or we'll surely be defeated.  Therefore, West must have the @cA for his 2@h bid. OK?|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


at|
Now if we could get an exact count on this hand and if that exact count showed West had 2 @cs, the @cAx, we could limit our loss to only one @c, the @cA.  Do you see how?|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt|Yes, lead low to the board's @cK and play low on the @c return.  West must play the @cA and your @cQ is now a winner.|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


at|
Better yet, if we stripped the @ds from our hands after we drew trumps, West, upon winning his doubleton @cA would be reduced to nothing but @hs and possibly the 13th @d.  He'd have to lead away from his @hA or give us a ruff-sluff if he led the last @d.|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


at|
Unfortunately, we can't get an exact count on the opps' hands.  Our beautiful endplay vanishes when we realize that.  However, playing on elimination lines seems like a good idea since West is marked with the 2 missing Aces.|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


at|
The play of the first 5 tricks should be routine. Draw trumps and eliminate @ds.  As long as West has both missing Aces there's a play which works no matter West's distribution   The clue is North - South each has a doubleton @h.|

With @hs stripped from North - South, our partial elimination will become a full elimination endplay. West will have to lead away from his @cA or give us a ruff-sluff by leading a @h or the 13th @d. You all see this?|SK||

But East - West have played this game before.  Suppose that at trick ##7, West, instead of cashing his @HQ, tries to reach partner... avoiding the endplay.|

Up to now there's been little mention of opening leads in this course.  There are certain lead conventions and agreements between players that we all use.  Declarers should be aware of these and use them when forming a plan.|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


at|
West leads the @d10.  Dummy has the @d9, also known as "Curse of Scotland."  East opened 1@d.|
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


at|
It seems West has short @ds.  If dummy didn't have the @d9, West could have led from @d1098(x) but it's more likely West started with @d108.  If so our contract is in trouble.|
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


at| We have a combined 26 high card points and East opened the bidding ,so most of those points are there including, no doubt, the mighty @hA.|
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


nt|The Ace of trump is THE card to have.  With it declarer has control of the play to a certain extent.  Without it the defense is in charge.|
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


at|
When we play trump, East will hop up with his @hA and lead another @d. Our @dQ will be ruffed away.  There's still the @cA to lose, so we are down 1.  :(|

We can't take the @hA away from East but there is something we can do to disrupt the enemy communication.  Before we play trump we can...|

Here's the lesson text:  When the defense threatens to add a ruff to their 3 Aces declarer must take emergency measures.  He uses a SCISSORS COUP to snip the defender's line of communication by discarding his 3rd @d on the @sQ before leading trumps.|
