at|Peter Brennan: The purpose of this course is to acquaint you with some useful tools when you declare a hand. Hopefully, by seeing a number of examples in random order you'll recognize these situations when they pop up in your game.  

Each hand features a common challenge of some sort:  dealing with bad suit breaks, handling tricky entry situations, making inferences from the bidding or play, counting enemy distribution and/or points, when to draw trumps, basic end plays, etc.

These hands should be played using IMP or rubber bridge tactics.  Don't even think of risking the contract to make a measly overtrick or two.

You may have seen this hand if you've been attending Dave Germain's (Euvid) excellent classes on Wednesdays in the BIL. When I watched two different declarers go down because they misplayed the  @h suit I decided to include this topic in class.  (Thanks, Dave !)|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


at|
Our focus is on the  @h suit. The 7 cards outstanding will divide 4 - 3, 62% of the time. That's fine with us. We'll lose 3 @hs and the @cA; our 9 tricks are there.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


at| But what if those pesky @hs divide 5 - 2, which happens 31% of the time?  With only the @hA as a stopper, we could lose 4 @hs and the @cA for down 1.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|The hidden asset in  @h is South's @h109xx.  With the @hAx on the table declarer has a surprisingly powerful combination !|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at|
Assuming West began with 5 @hs it is clear they weren't headed by the @hKQJ because he would have led the @hK, not 4th best. @hKQxxx,  @hKJxxx or  @hQJxxx are possible holdings from West.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|
If this is true, East has @hHonor x.  Possibly @hKx, @hQJ, @hQx, etc.  Everybody agree with this so far?|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|
What should East do with his @Hhonor x when declarer plays the @hA on the opening lead? Unblock by dropping the honor under the @hA? Or should he play low and keep his high card?|pc|HA|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|
If he unblocks the high card - even if he wins the next trick with the @cA and leads his remaining low @h - our  @h1095 will serve as a 2nd stopper.  By dropping the @hHonor East promoted our @h1095 into a 2nd @h trick.|pc|HQ|hc|HT95|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


up|1|hc|HKQJ|PC|H8|nt|If East does not unblock - now the defenders have the @hK, @hQ and the @hJ against our @h1093 but the suit is blocked.  If West overtakes East's @hQ, once again our @h1093 is promoted into a 2nd @h trick.|sk||
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


at|
We see what a powerful holding Ax opposite 109xx is in a NT contract.  Similar holdings can be as productive - Kx - 109xx, A10 - 98xx, Ax - 98xx (if East has Honor10 doubleton), etc.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |

Does everyone see what would happen if declarer had ducked the first trick?|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


up|2|pc|H4HQH2|lc|Hkjqt95|at| Then East takes the trick and replays the suit to remove declarer's last stopper.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at| Declarer always goes down since West has an entry (@CA) and 3 @H tricks...|hc|CAHKJ7|pc|H8h5h3hA|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt|Here's the lesson text: It would be correct to holdup one round of hearts if South's @hs were weaker. But with  @h109xx the correct play is to rise with dummy's  @hA. If the lead was from a 5-card suit, the @hA should put East in a hopeless situation. He can either block the suit or promote South's @h10.|lc|caHKJ7|up|7|sc||

You need to develop 2 more, either both in @c or 1 @c and 1 @h.  But if @ss are 5 - 3 you can only afford to lose the lead once.  Good luck!|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


at|
The plan is to test  @cs since they can provide the two extra tricks you need.  Here's the good news - given the  @c holding in your hand and the dummy, the probability of making 3 tricks is almost 90%.|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


at|
But how you tackle the suit is the key here.  If  @cs are split 3 - 2, you will always make 3 @c tricks no matter how you play or misplay the suit, so it's prudent to  guard against a 4 - 1 break, if possible.|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


at|
Taking precautions to protect a holding from bad breaks is called a SAFETY PLAY.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


at|
With this combination in  @cs the correct play to guard against a 4 - 1 (or 5 - 0) split is the @cA first.|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


pc|SK|pc|S8|pc|S4|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


pc|C3|pc|C7|pc|CA|pc|CK|nt|This play pays big dividends with this particular layout.  When the  @cK falls under the Ace you have an nearly automatic 10 tricks - 2 @ss, 1 @h, 4 @ds and 3 @cs.|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


at|
I can hear some of you saying, "Sure, stiff King offside.  What about more normal holdings?"  I've prepared two more hands where North - South hands are the same.  Only the defenders' distributions varies.|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


at|
Next hand coming. Now we can look at all the four hands.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


sk||md|0,C8,,D6|up|1|at|
As before we cash the @cA first. |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |

Then, if nothing exciting happened, cross to dummy with a @d and lead a low  @c towards the Jack in your hand.|PC|C8|

at| When you lead a 2nd round of  @cs, three things can happen:|

pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt|If it loses or West follows with a  small @c, the suit splits 3 - 2 and the board's @CQ9 will provide your 8th and 9th tricks.|

nt|Next variation...|up|3|
md|0,cTC2,,d9h6|

Case 2.  When you lead a small  @c from dummy, East shows out (West started with @cK10xx) - Play the  @cJ.|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


pc|H4|pc|CJ|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


at|
West will be forced to win with his King and, later, the marked finesse of the board's @cQ9 will pick up West's @c10 and provide your 8th and 9th tricks.|

Case 3. When you lead a small @c from dummy, East follows with a low @c. - Play the @cJ.  Now it's West who shows out, so East has the @cK10 remaining  behind the board's Q9.|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


pc|C2|pc|CJ|pc|HT|at|
With this distribution you can't make 3 @c tricks.  But, with one extra trick (the @cJ) in your pocket, turn your attention to @h to establish your 9th trick.|

pc|DA|mc|9|sk||sc|y|nt|Notice in Cases 1 and 3 above, East followed to the board's lead toward your @cJxx with a low @c.  If East has the@cK, he can't afford to play it because it will set up your @cJ and dummy's @cQ so he must play low.  Everybody understand that?|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


at|
Here's the lesson text. Although after seeing it so many times you've probably memorized it by now : ). With seven top tricks, we'll need to develop two more, either both in  @c or 1 @c and 1 @h. The standard SAFETY PLAY is to cash the  @cA then lead towards the  @cJ.|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |

nt|Now that's a dummy to display with pride. With 8 @s tricks and the @hA you're practically home. Surely the red suits should provide at least 1 more trick. However, if you're having a bad day there is a slight danger of losing a @h and 3@ds. Can you avoid all risks?  Good luck!|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


at|
It's easy to miss the winning line of play here. You all know the concept of the dangerous opponent, the one you don't want in the lead.  In this hand which opp is the "dangerous" one?  Why?|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


at|
Of course, East.  Too bad a losing @h finesse will put him on lead.  IF WE COULD ONLY LOSE THE LEAD TO WEST INSTEAD BECAUSE HE CAN'T ATTACK  @D.|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


at| If we throw our losing @h on the @cA it has the same effect as losing the @h finesse to West.  Luckily, our @hQJT will provide a 10th trick.|
pc|C6|pc|C9|pc|H3|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


nt|Now, it's a matter of good technique. We must lead @h from the table after trumps are gone. Just in case @s are 2 - 0 (48%), play @sK, then the @sA.  Keep a low @s in your hand for another entry to dummy.|

Now the  @hQ planning to discard a low @d if the K doesn't appear.  This is called a LOSER ON LOSER play. We don't care if we lose the trick to West because he can't attack  @d.|

East has shown a 5-card @h suit with 9 hcps. It's reasonable to place him with the @dK as well because there aren't too many points floating around for his vulnerable opening bid.  Everyone agree?|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


at|
If we're right about the @dK, ten tricks are there by means of an ENDPLAY.  We'll give East the lead with a @h when he will have no safe exit card. Any ideas how to accomplish this?|
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


nt|First, we must remove any safe exit card East holds.  Draw trump, and cash two @cs ending on the table.|

At this point we don't care about East's distribution; as long as he's holding the @dK, it doesn't matter how many @hs, @ds or @cs he has left.  He's about to become very unhappy. : )|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


at|
We lead the @h and East wins while we throw the @d2. We have no interest in ruffing this trick.  Instead we sluff a @d, a sure loser anyway. We want East in the lead. This is another example of a LOSER ON LOSER play.|pc|H6|pc|HT|pc|D2|pc|D5|

mc|10|sk||sc|y|at| That's an example of an ENDPLAY combined with a LOSER ON LOSER play. (2 for the price of 1)|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


nt|The lesson text is: Declarer is lucky not to receive a @d lead which would change the timing of the hand and lead to down 1. Instead, South is able to strip the black suits and put East on lead with a LOSER ON LOSER play. East is then ENDPLAYED.|

Many thanks to the BIL's foremost teacher,  Albrecht Hollstein (xx1943) for this beautiful hand.  His website is full of useful information with plenty of hands to study and learn from at: ^*Hwww.albrecht-hollstein.de/Bridge/Bridge%20with%20Al.htm^*n.|
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


nt|Here's the lesson text:  A trump lead followed by a second trump when the defense gets in would sink this slam because you'll need two ruffs in dummy and @c no worse than 4 - 2 to come to 12 tricks. Since a second  @c is sure to be overruffed, declarer must "transfer" the ruff from  @c to  @d. This is accomplished by a LOSER-ON-LOSER play.|
