^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."
Mitch Edelman aka mitche 

Ok let's play bridge!

MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.

pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|sk||at|mitche:  Bidding:  first, let's discuss what 2@S meant.
It was a transfer bid to Clubs.  If you use 4-way transfers, then 2@S transfers to 3@C, and 2NT by responder transfers
to 3@D.  We will discuss later. 
In any case, 2@S wants opener to bid 3@C.  So the double by N was a very strong wish for South to lead spades - it was not takeout.
Anyway, West advertised clubs, and North has spades.  We agreed on what 2@S and X mean?
If, after the X, East accepts the transfer by bidding 3@C, it usually means "I have some good stuff in clubs".|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  East can bid 2NT to say "I have not got good clubs", but when N doubled, East is off the hook.
3@C should still mean "good clubs",  but pass means "minimum NT"  or a tolerance for spades.  
Here, E should bid 2NT over the X with Spade stop and no club honor.
If West wants to raise to 3NT or bid 3@C, she can do so.  

My preference, by the way is for passing the X to show 3 spades, redouble to show 4 of them. 
The NT bidder just might be willing to play in a 4-3 fit and make the doubler pay for his bid. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Here, of course, E/W do NOT want to play in spades - so E passes and W can redouble to say 
"please complete the transfer".
Let me summarize: |ub|4|mb|p|an|max 3@s's, no great clubs|at| 
(1) Opener passes the X to say nothing particular about the hand, maximum of 3 spades, and no great clubs;|

(3) opener bids 3@C with good clubs; and |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


ub|1|mb|2n|an|maximum, no good fit|at|
(4) you can agree on 2NT as maximum, no particularly good club fit.  |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  This way, W can decide if 3NT is a good bet:
if opener raised to 3@C, he is very likely to have @cQxx or @cxxxx, and 6 club tricks are there. 

This is not beginner stuff that we just went over... 
BILAsst10: In this instance E should have passed?  After the double? 
mitche:  I would probably pass.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  You might look at Bridgeguys, or Mike Lawrence on overcalls.  I think he discusses lead-directing X there.
BILAsst10: E passes and then what? 
mitche:  W can redouble to say "please complete the transfer".

Why redouble?   If 2@S doubled is making, you are getting a very good score. 
One last thing -- if the NT bidders want to play 2@S X, North should bid 3@D. 
That's how she gets her 2 suits in.. |

up|52|pf|y|at|mitche: Play: When someone doubles a transfer bid (artificial bid), they are saying, they have got that suit, 
and some strength in it, like KQ10xx.  It helps you out with your opening lead.  
Unless opening leader has a very good reason not to, it's a good idea to cooperate by leading the suit pard doubled.

So S should not lead a heart - but a spade.  The declarer can always take 9 tricks at NT, even with spade lead,
but we don’t worry about that.  We just thank partner for his suggestion and lead a spade.|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Declarer should think really hard about the finesse in clubs. 
Here is why.. 
The odds are about equal on the clubs splitting 2-2 or not, but when N advertises long spades, 
that should tip the balance in favor of the finesse.
East - needs to count hearts more carefully.  He established his 5th heart, so he could have discarded a spade loser from dummy and take 11 tricks.|

at|mitche: Bidding:  West has a hand worth a 2@S Michaels Cue Bid , showing 5-5 in hearts and an undisclosed minor.  
^*iIf^*n  W bids 2@S, then what should N do?
WestElsdon:  3@S?
mitche:  Well, 3@S is just competing.  N has a pretty decent hand.
ecolodge:  I'd still bid @S game, I think.
mitche:  The reason I ask is that there is no good way in standard bidding for N to bid her hand! |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Some conventions have evolved to handle this kind of interference, but I would rather wait until
we are better in the basics  to discuss "unusual over unusual". 
A double of 2@S is probably a good idea then. 
I don’t know what it should mean, but I would take it as "spade support, not enough to force to game".
But over 2@H, N should bid 3@H to say "limit raise or better" in spades:
a "limit raise" is 10-12 dummy points in spades, so a 3@H bid here says 4 spades, 10+ dummy points.|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt||at|BILAsst10: Limit raise can be only 3-card trump support.
mitche:  At this level, I would expect 4-card support.  When you force to the 3 level, you are odds on to have 4. 
So in the actual auction, N bid 4@S and W continued to 5@D which must be a very distributional hand.
E properly corrected to 5@H and North doubled.  
I think that South has enough stuff to double. |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


nt||
at|WestElsdon:  I figured that E would be short in @D, so I didn't think I had enough.  
As I figured that spades would be short in both Opps hands.

mitche:  That's exactly why S should double.

up|42|pf|y|at|mitche:  Play:  Declarer is running into horrible splits.
After the defense cashes 3 black suit winners, S should lead a small heart.  Also, S should throw away
spades and hang onto diamonds.  Even if N leads a trump (or cashes the @CA and shifts to a trump), 
the defense will always beat 5@H as long as S keeps his diamonds.

at|mitche:  Bidding:  I guess E has a choice of bids over 1@C:  double, 1@S, or 2@C (Michaels cue bid). 
I rate them as 1@S, then 2@C,  and X as the poorest choice. 
And this is a matter more of style than of bridge logic. There is something to be said for all of them... 
But 1@S is certainly reasonable.
What should S do over 1@S?
Pass is quite reasonable.  I do not like raising 1@C to 2 with just 3-card support, and a flat hand, to boot.  |
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  West has the world’s worst 10 point hand.  If you use Marty Bergen's "adjust - 3" guideline,
West would be quite correct to deduct 2 points and figure the hand to be worth 8 points,
So I would content myself with a 2@S raise over 1@S - and hope I am not overbidding.
South should pass 1@S, and W shouldn’t bid 1NT, but should raise 1@S to 2 with 3-card support
and a weak hand.  |
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: In the actual auction, East decided to bid 2@H (not unreasonable, actually -- W might have 3 of them)
But after W bid 2@S, East's jump to 4@S was, well adventuresome. 
In other words, it was an overbid by a lot. West promised a MAXIMUM of 9 or 10 points, yes?
And in addition to a maximum of 10 points, some of them are in clubs - W bid no trump, therefore,
East can see that club cards are going to be completely useless to her so the most prudent thing for East
to do is pass 2@S.|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Here is the lesson point:  West showed very lukewarm support for the East hand with
1NT and then 2@S over 2@H.  That being the case, then, East's hand has not improved in the auction.

So a minimum overcall and a minimum response by partner doesn’t make for game.

at|mitche:  Bidding:  Someone wondered about the 1NT bid.
Playing Standard American, E would bid 2@H to show 10+ points and 5+ hearts.
But playing 2 over 1, the E hand is not good enough for a game-forcing 2@H bid.
  A) the hand may be a misfit.
  b) East just isn’t strong enough to insist on a game contract on a possible misfit. |

at|mitche:  West's 3@S announces 6 good spades and 16-18 points.
So 3@S is OK - what should East do now?  She bid 3NT.
Hard to see that as the cards lie, 6@S is making, and 4@S is a better place to play too.. 
gypsy1308: Has 2 losers
mitche:  No, not in spades. You win the opening lead, play trumps,  ruff a heart, and win 6 spades, 
5 hearts and the @DA.  
(MM: If you win in hand with @dQ, as the @dAce is only entry to long hearts, if Q holds, 13 tricks)   |

south would feel a squeeze on the heart run :) )

(S is actually a shade light, but the good 6 card spade suit is enough compensation for the S hand to bid here)

In Standard American, a free bid by responder shows about a king more than minimum.

If S has that really sound 5-card suit, the @sAK is more than adequate support.|

With something like  @sQJxx   @hKJx   @dJxxx   @cxx        
I bid 2@D, or  (depending on my agreements about negative X)  I double.
With the example hand I bid 2@D.

at|mitch:  Play:  With the W hand, I do not lead a club. 
Leading an unsupported ace in a side suit at trump contract is losing bridge, even when partner overcalled the suit.
Really, folks, really!  I lead the @H10.
Turns out that if W leads the @h10, East will win the @hA and count the diamond suit. 
Since S is unlikely to raise a minor with fewer than 4 of them (with 3, she would look for no trump), 
I would try @DA and a second diamond, then W can cash he @CA to defeat the contract.|

at|mitche:  Here is the way East could think as defender: there are 6 diamonds in dummy, 4 in declarer's hand
(almost surely), so I know about 12 diamonds, and that leaves just 1 with my partner.  I can give her a ruff.
She will then know how to continue (cash the setting trick).

This type of inferential counting is not hard to do, but it isn't completely obvious.
It requires you to draw a conclusion from the opponents' bidding, and that takes practice.
When you hear the bidding, try to build a picture of the unseen hands' distribution. |

at|mitche:  You will get better at it with practice.  
annie8888:  Was discarding @hJ a good idea?
mitche:  Good idea to ditch heart.  Guarantees you lose just 1 of them.

MM:  By clicking on the cards, you can play the hand Double Dummy,

at|mitche:  Bidding:  4441 shape is probably the most awkward to bid - S decided to bid 1@D, 
which is the best bid, I think.  After the 1@S response, I think there are 2 sensible bids: 2NT or 2@H.

2NT is probably getting more votes than 2@H because the heart suit is kind of thin.
If the @D10 were the @H10, then I might bid 2@H.|
pg| ***** 120 ***** |


sk||at|
If S bids 2NT, showing 18-19 HCP, N should bid 3@H, which would get them to 4@H - the best contract.|
pg| ***** 121 ***** |


nt||at|
4@H is always making 11 tricks, as long as hearts are 3-2, 
and 3NT can lose 3 spades and a heart, as the cards are situated.

Partner didn't take trick 1 with the Ace   => declarer has it

When P gets in and returns the @c5 (which ^*icould^*n have been from T65....declarer plays the 6...=>

at|mitch:  Play:  East returned a club when she came in with the @HQ; after the lead of the small club,
that seems the right play;
But when W won the @C7, she should have realized that the @CA10 were on her right. 
How could she know? Clearly the ace is with south, because E would have played that card at trick 1
Next, if E started with @cQ105, her correct card would have been the @C10, not the 5
So E cannot have started with @cQ105. |

at|mitche:  OK.  This is important stuff, folks, which is why we stress standard carding.
If you know carding signals you can work out suit distribution with most partners.
UDCA (mm: Upside Down Count and Attitude) also works, but more people know standard carding.
So west can see that leading a club costs a trick.  She can get out safely with spade ace and a another spade.

at|mitche:  So tonight’s hands taught us something about defense. 
Thanks to Eileen for her generous assistance and to all of you for your courteous participation. 


MM: You can play the hand Double Dummy if you wish
