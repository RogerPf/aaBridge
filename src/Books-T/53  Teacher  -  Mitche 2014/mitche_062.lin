MM: The recommended screen resolution for .lin movies is 1440 x 900 pixels 
(rightclick on your desktop,select "personalize" "screen defenitions")
Also, make sure you have "widescreen" checked in your windows BBO-version
(If you're not sure about your settings log into your BBO windows version then:  
click the yellow tool at bottom and under the "general" tab check "widescreen" and save)
This will prevent the "cutting off" of the bottom parts or scrambling of your text in these presentations.

If you downloaded BBO recently, you will not be able to get online with the windows version...
You can still change or check your settings: 
Go to your C disc, and under "programs" find the Bridge Base Online folder
Open it and find the "profiles" folder
Open and scroll to find: BBO_Default_Settings 
line 71 should read: WIDE_CLIENT=1
If your setting is 0, change it to 1 and save.

fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."
Mitch Edelman aka mitche 



MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.
Thank you Eileen (wyoming33) for sending the hands and editing the chatlog! @h

|sk||at|mitche:  Bidding:  Make sure your regular partnerships discuss this auction (the preemptive raise) --
It happens a lot of the time.
Marty Bergen has no real problem with preemptive raises such as this, but even he likes advancer to have more shape.
Let me clarify one point - this raise shows a weak hand -- 
With better values, a cue bid shows "limit+" strength.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||
at|atrump:  Was my negative  X  ok?
mitche:  Yes. negative  double was perfect.
peggyall:  Should I bid 3 spades?
mitche:  It's close. Your hand is probably too flat to bid.  
Responder has another bid, and with 10 points or so, South will reopen the bidding.
Essentially, North's opening promised a minimum opener. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  The bidding hasn’t improved it very much (@HK, @DQ look like defensive cards).
Responder might reopen with X, and then you can bid 3@s or pass, if you think you'd rather defend 
(not on this hand!!).

at|mitche: Play:  There are times when it might be right to underlead one, but they are so infrequent that you should pretty 
much never lead from a suit headed by an unsupported ace against a trump contract (especially from length).
Turns out that the @DT was particularly unhappy, because it promoted a second @D trick for the declarer.

Now, one other point.  When around trick 7, declarer led a small club from dummy, 
North went in with the Ace, and declarer now has 2 certain club tricks (she can always get 2 by 
playing the @CQ and ducking a club later)  but playing the ace is basically surrendering a trick.|

|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


sk||
at|mitche:  Bidding:  I consider the East hand balanced.   
With 322 side shape, this is the absolute worst shape to have for a weak 2. 
So if you want to preempt on it, you need some compensation in the form of a slightly stronger suit, 
something like @sKJ109xx or @sAJ10xxxx, so you will be able to hold the trump losers to 1 most of the time.|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt||at|Another way to look at it: 
East's hand has 9 losers. Typically, a weak 2 has 8 or even 7 losers.  
So be careful opening this hand with 2@s. 
After the 2@S opener, no one has anything sane to bid.  So pass, pass, pass seems correct.

SK||

at|mitche: Bidding:  An essential part of 2 over 1 (and also SAYC) is "new minor forcing", 
And 2@C was NMF here.  This bid is artificial. Responder may or may not have clubs.  
She is asking "do you have 3-card support for my major?"
Opener says "yes" by bidding 2@h (responder's major). 
Otherwise, opener makes the most descriptive bid she can.  
And here, it would be 2@d, not 2NT. 2@d shows a 5-card suit and at most 2 hearts. |
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  After 2@d, North can do whatever seems correct 
(maybe it's bidding 2@H or passing or bidding an invitational 2NT.  
Here, North would mentally flip a coin and either bid 2@h (showing a GOOD 5-card suit) or 2NT.

(note MM: NMF comes in a few flavors.

at|mitch:  Play:   A spade was as good as anything else, and here it establishes 3 tricks for the defense.
Declarer has to count tricks. She has 1 spade (on lead); 1@D, perhaps 2; 1 or 2 hearts, and so she needs 
to develop all her extra tricks in clubs. So the @H lead was correct.

sk||

at|mitche: Bidding:  I guess East bid 3@H as a limit raise.
2 points:  
A) You really want a 4-card support to bid at the 3-level.  
Better here is to bid 1NT (forcing) and then raise to 3@h.    Reason for this: 
If opener has minimum opening with a weak 5-card suit, you won’t like it when the defense begins to shorten her trumps. 
B) With a balanced hand 4333, you may be better off in 3NT. 
Put the @DK in your hand, for example, and 3NT may be on ice.

pg| ***** 81 ***** |


sk||at|mitche:  Bidding:  East decided that her hand was worth an opening bid. 
I agree. When you have 2 Aces and a King, strain to find an opening bid.
2@d was a Michaels cue bid, promising something like 5-5 in the Majors, which is exactly what she had. 
What should west do with his giraffe?
I am not sure what is best, but 3@D is not it. 3@D is not forcing, just competing. 
I think best is to double 2@d, showing a good hand. The bidding is not going to die at 2@DX. |
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  6@D is kind of a flyer. 
East might have the Kings of hearts and diamonds, in which case 6@D is doomed. 
I recommend starting with a double of 2@d, followed by a cue bid of 4@s with the West's hand.  
Note that there is no science for dealing with wild shape like this.
geeeoo:  would the cue bid show first round control?
mitche:  4@s would guarantee first round control. East, staring at the @SA will realize West has a spade void, 
and by inference, a very healthy @D fit. |
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Freak hands are really hard to bid scientifically!!
Oh, BTW, the 6@d bid was a stab in the dark, but a very reasonable one.

(Karen10: Would a direct cuebid of the implied suits be an option? 
To set the @d-suit trump and start a control bidding sequence?)

up|52|pf|y|at|mitch: Play: Where are South's 9 tricks? How should she plan to play? 
She has just 1 trick outside of hearts, so she should plan to establish some tricks in clubs. 
Best would be to play a club at trick 3 and discard a spade.
That sets up a couple of tricks and forces the defense to cash its spades before 2 of them go away on the clubs.

at|So the best defense is to play the @HA and a second round at tricks 2 and 3
Then declarer is going down a bunch.
Eliza said she wants to dissuade the defense from leading trumps. 
Good idea, but you get back the tricks by establishing clubs.
geeeoo:  Would a heart lead have been better then?|

MM: You can play the hand Double Dummy if you wish
