MM: The recommended screen resolution for .lin movies is 1440 x 900 pixels 
(rightclick on your desktop,select "personalize" "screen defenitions")
Also, make sure you have "widescreen" checked in your windows BBO-version
(If you're not sure about your settings log into your BBO windows version then:  
click the yellow tool at bottom and under the "general" tab check "widescreen" and save)
This will prevent the "cutting off" of the bottom parts or scrambling of your text in these presentations.

If you downloaded BBO recently, you will not be able to get online with the windows version...
You can still change or check your settings: 
Go to your C disc, and under "programs" find the Bridge Base Online folder
Open it and find the "profiles" folder
Open and scroll to find: BBO_Default_Settings 
line 71 should read: WIDE_CLIENT=1
If your setting is 0, change it to 1 and save.

fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. 
We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. 
My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the
table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."
Mitch Edelman aka mitche 



MM: For this lesson, Mitch introduced a new format - the first two hands consist of Mitch bidding the hands in all 4 seats - with questions and comments during the bidding.

On the last 4 hands -- in "real time" -- bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.
Thank you Eileen (wyoming33) for sending the hands and editing the chatlog! @h

3@s shows a hand with 6 spades, a good suit, and about 16 -18 points.  Close, but not close enough. 
2@H shows a better hand than 2@s, so we will bid that.|

at|Well, let's see: 2@s is clearly wrong. 
2NT is invitational, places the NT contract on the right side, and DENIES 4 HEARTS.
We're too good for 2NT, 3NT would be better, but still, no cupie doll.
That brings us to heart raises. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  What is West's hand worth in support points in hearts?
West has 12 HCP plus a quality club suit (|cp|4|at|4+ card suit with 3 of the 5 top honors = 1 point|cp||at|) 
and a VERY good card in the @SA. 
So after 2@H, West's hand has gotten better.  West now has the equivalent of a full opener opposite 
East's 2@h bid.  So the bid is 4@h.|

pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|mitche: Bidding:  We WANT to be in hearts for 2 good reasons:   
a) a 4-4 fit is more flexible, and 
b) spades will generate discards in a @H contract, but hearts won't generate discards in a spade contract.
BILAsst10: Well - if ops take their tricks off the top there can be no discards.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt||at| 
mitche:  Ops have been known not to take their tricks off the top.
In SA, with a 2@c response, the auction would be 1@s – 2@C/ 2@H - 4@h
East should pass 4@h (fast arrival).|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Play:   What should S lead against 4@h?
One could argue for a club or a @D. Declarer will try for the maximum number of tricks.|

or if North should cash the @CA. 
Note - that will set up discards for East's losers.
Well, it really is a guess.  At IMPS, you might very well lead a trump or spade here, trying to 
defeat the contract.  A spade would work if South has an entry and can give you a @D ruff.  
Remember, North doesn't know East's shape.|

lb|*mWhat should East bid?^1@d~1@c~Pass^1|at|I think this is a clear-cut opening bid. With 5-4 shape, 12 HCP, no "adjust-3", and 2 1/2 quick tricks, 
it is a Bergen 20 (or Mitch 22 = 20 + 2 Quick Tricks) opener.
If East opens 1@c what to rebid?
If responder bids a major over 1@c, you have to decide whether you want to bid 1NT or 2@C or 2@d.    
All of them are wrong to varying degrees.
So to have an easier time rebidding, I vote for a 1@d opening.|

at|Let's look at what each bid might show -- 3@H shows 5 hearts and  ??? points ???
A FREE bid at the 3-level is at least 11 points, because you are forcing partner to bid (3@H is forcing) 
and you're at the 3 level.
And the @SKJ don't look very useful on offense after the 2@s preempt.
Our hand has soft values and strength in the opp's suit. 
That means we should not bid 3@h  (Or 2NT or 3NT or Anything)
I would consider a negative X, but I would not be happy if opener bids 3@C. So I will pass and let partner decide what to do.

at|mitche: Play: Note that N/S went for 200 and E/W have no game. So down 2 is death.

How does NT play for E/W?
The defense has 3 diamonds, the @HK and the @SA – E/W cannot make game.
WestElsdon:  Possibly make 1NT.
mitche:  Which is still less than 200.|

nt||
at|mitche:  Was South unlucky?  Well, kind of.. 
I would expect a lot of -200's for N/S, and a couple of plusses when West goes overboard, especially were 
South to bid 1@s.

Here is a hint. When you have length in the suit bid by your opponent, tread gently.
Those cards might be useful on defense and they won't be of much use to you as declarer, unless it's in no trump.

But in play, East discarded a @D on the play of the spade suit.  East has to hang onto his diamond

can make is that East is unbalanced (well, his hand is, anyway) and probably has 5 diamonds. |

If you've never heard it before, you would not know how to show a big hand with a fit in opener's suit.

So let's assume that the bidding goes 1 plum by pard, 1 banana by your RHO raises to 2 plums, 3 plums, 
or 4 plums, which are all weak bids, showing 3, 4, or 5 plums in your hand (they are designed to obstruct 
rather than be constructive bids) if you don't make a neg X, you show strong support by an immediate 
cue bid, or 2 bananas. |

at|mitche:  So South can bid 2@H (East overcalled hearts, so @h = bananas for our example).
North will bid 2@s over 2@h (looking for 3NT) and South would happily bid game in NT with his heart stopper
Actually, South has a slam-invitational hand so she might bid 3@C over 2@s, giving North a chance to get excited.

North will not get excited with his minimum opener and rebid 3@d, 
South will then bid 3NT and that will be that.|
pg| ***** 108 ***** |

3NT will take at least 10 tricks as the cards are situated.
2@h bid doesn't show slam interest, only a limit raise (10 points or more) with @D support.|
pg| ***** 109 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Your 3@c bid will tell pard "game forcing".
If you bid 3@d over 2@s, then you'd be saying  "just a limit raise".
As I play it, after the cue bid, a new suit by responder is game-forcing and may be just a stopper.

Also, please note that since in my sample, North bid 2@s, South should assume only a spade stopper, 
not a really good spade suit. |
pg| ***** 110 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Why?  South could have made a negative X over 1@h so North knows that South doesn't 
have as many as 4 spades.

2@s by North would be a "want to get to NT" bid.  A "control bid", as it were.
Once South knows that North can stop spades, she will go for 3NT or a @D slam.

at|mitch:  Play in 6@d was about as good as you can do. You always lose a spade and a heart.

at|mitche: Bidding:  East might have opened 2@s, but with a broken suit and 2 outside honors, I think pass was correct.
After 3@c, West has some stuff, but it is pretty scary to come in at the 3 level with 3 cards in the preempter's suit 
and a poor quality heart suit.  So I pass and hope partner can reopen the bidding. 

North was very disciplined in passing 3@c. 
And East, being just as vul as he was at the start of the auction, opted for a pass --also a good idea.  
So the auction was quite reasonable by all players.

up|46|pf|y|at|mitch:  Play:   It was absolutely a free play for Declarer (South) to put in the @SQ from dummy at trick 1.
If West underled the @SK, she will make the contract, and if not, well, the @SA will be used to discard a loser.
Good idea, Laura.
As it turns out, it didn't cost her anything when West ruffed the @SA. It was at the expense of a natural 
trump trick (suppose South won the @SA and discarded a @D) then West wins the @CQ and declarer still has 
4 red-suit losers.|
