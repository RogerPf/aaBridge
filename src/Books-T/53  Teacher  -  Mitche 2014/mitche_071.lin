fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back yard), 3 (spoiled) recue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defender's perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgement and avoiding common mistakes in play."

at|mitche: Bidding:   South bid 2@h over 1@c – pass.
I think that it is very common, certainly the majority of players treat that auction (1@c-pass-2@h) 
as showing a long heart suit and a weak hand. 
Playing "pre-emptive jump shifts" by  responder is the usual treatment. 
Since 1@h is forcing, there is no need to jump to show a strong hand. South's correct bid is 1@h.
|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  IF West wants to get into the auction, the best way would be to double 2@h 
(West would probably think that 2@h was pre-emptive).
West has support for both unbid suits and so the easiest way to engage partner is to give him a vote 
in what should be the trump suit. 
So, if you want to get into the auction with West's hand with this bidding -- double. 

Should you want to get into the auction with the west hand?
|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  There are 2 answers possible ---- maybe, or maybe not... :) 
BILAsst10: That should be a pre-emptive bid less than 6 HCP.  So yes I think west should.
mitche:  Well, showing a heart suit, anyway, and no outside stuff bigger than a Queen.
OK ... let me discuss South's bid.
|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: a) 4@h might be described as "I want to play 4@h and that is that!."
But South has a hand that if opener has the @HK and @DA instead of the @CK and @DQJ will make 6.   
So   1@c-4@h is a bad idea.
b) Next, we agree that 1@c - 2@h is pre-emptive, and 1@c - 3@h would be a splinter bid in support of clubs.
I recommend that we use splinters. They are pretty much standard now.  
Even Audrey Grant's books use them!
|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  So by elimination, South should bid 1@h, which is 100% forcing. 
OPENER Guarantees a second bid.

West should have doubled if she believed 2@h was weak.
Now, after 3@s, South should bid 4NT.  
North promises at least 3 hearts (probably to an honor) and an opening bid.
|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  All South is interested in is the number of key cards. If North shows 3 key cards, 
South will bid 6 hearts.
There are 5 key cards, the 4 aces and the trump king. 
You may wish to look at Howard's page or bridgeguys for Key Card Blackwood, 
which is also considered standard bidding now.|

at|mitche: Bidding:  After 1@d,    2@c by responder is game forcing... 
You are in GF auction.  Partner cannot pass until you get to game.
Now, after 2NT, what does 4@c mean? (hint - it isn’t clubs).|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


at|
Most pairs treat it as Gerber.  
If it's not Gerber, then it should demand opener to start control bidding, but it should be Gerber for you all.
|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  So South should count to 3 and say --- 4NT.
North now can count 13 tricks (2 major suit aces and 11 tricks in the minors) and should bid 7NT.  
That would be the recommended auction.

WestElsdon: Is the 4NT quantitative?
mitche:  Not in response to Gerber 4@c.
Had North bid 4NT instead of 4@c then that would have been a quantitative raise of 2NT.

Key point on this deal
a)  2@c over 1@D is game forcing and 
b) treat a 4@C bid over a naturally bid NT (1NT, 2NT, or 3NT) as ace-asking.

at|mitche: Bidding: When East bids 2@h over 1NT, she pretty much guarantees a full opening bid. 
With a minimum balanced hand, East would pass 1NT. (West is a passed hand)
So 2@h shows a sound opener, and West invites game. East is happy to accept.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


at|
North wondered if she should overcall 2@d after 1NT.
I think 2@d would be OK.  
It is a bit thin, but you would like a @D lead - the opponents would not get rich doubling 2@d and defending.
Also, since North is a passed hand, south will not expect a lot more than you have.

at|mitche: The opening lead of the @D9 is a top of nothing lead. 
So North would be happy to see South continue diamonds, yes?
The way to encourage partner to continue the suit is to play as high a card as you can spare -- the 6.
When North played the @D2, it says "No interest in continuing diamonds."
The consequence of the @D2 is that South thought the only chance to beat the contract lay in the club suit.
|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Yes, you give information to the opponents, but you also help partner to find the right course of action.   
Signalling is essential to proper defence.

When declarer played 3 rounds of trump, she risked the contract.|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt||at|Better is to win the first 
diamond, play a spade to the @sJ, and then ruff 2 spades.   
Trumps are high enough to assure there won’t be an overruff, 
and this still leaves enough high trumps to pick up the trump suit.
|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: So the play should be. @DAce at trick 1, Spade finesse - losing, a trump return by South,
@SAce and a @s ruff, @d ruff, @s ruff, pull trumps and concede 2 clubs.

mitche:  How many losers does South have?
WestElsdon: 8
mitche: So should North just blast or invite, using LTC?
Well, is there a game? 8+5 = 13, so game looks very reasonable. 
|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  I want you to start to think about losing trick count.  
It really helps decide whether to bid game, invite, or play in part score.
Here the N/S hands have an easy game with just 24 HCP.
WestElsdon:  With an LTC of 8 in my hand, should I have bid 3@H to invite?
mitche:  No, 2@h was fine
|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt||at|ecolodge:  Does South have enough pts to bid 2@C - game forcing?
mitche:  No, 2@c is an overbid on South hand.
South needs a 7-loser hand (or better) even to think about 2@c bid. 
Even thinking about bidding 2@c is an overbid!

at|mitche:  Play:  The @DJ looks like a reasonable lead. 
Declarer extracts trumps in 2 rounds, finishing in hand, she then led what at trick 4?
It was the @CKing and East played the Queen under his majesty.
When East plays the @CQ, how many clubs would you expect her to have?
WestElsdon:  Just the 1.
mitche:  Right!  It would be foolish to play the Queen unless it were singleton.
|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


nt||at|ecolodge:  When the @CQ falls, doesn't that make all the @C's good in South 
and the losing @S go away in North hand?
mitche:  So how many clubs does that leave for West?|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


at| 
Three of them to the 10.
Playing the Ace on the King promotes the @C10 to being the SECOND highest club, 
a winner after the @CJ is played (or an immediate winner if declarer doesn't play the J).
The point is that playing the @cAce created a loser where there was none.  And it cost 3 tricks! 
|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Declarer can win the @CK,@CA, and then the Jack.
Now what happens to all of North's spades?|
pg| ***** 68 ***** |

Bye, Bye, and you win 13 tricks.. 
But if the defence starts with spades (they most emphatically should NOT), the defence gets its 2 tricks.
And the LTC said you should probably win 11 tricks.

at|mitche: Bidding:  First, with 4/4 distribution in the minors, I suggest you start with 1@d, not 1@c.  
There are many reasons for doing that.
Standard bidding:  If you are 3-3 in the minors, open 1@C.
If you are 4-4 in the minors, open 1@d. 
Assuming, of course, you cannot open 1 of a Major or 1NT.
Otherwise, open your longer minor.
|
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  1@h overcall is the right bid.  This is a book 1@h overcall.
South bid 2@s, thinking it is weak.

RULE: when you make a pre-emptive jump overcall, you absolutely, positively promise 
you have NO Aces or Kings outside your suit.  
So South should bid 1@s not 2. A normal response with long spades and 7 HCP|
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


at|
Now... what should West do over 2@s?
|
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Unless you play "Romex" doubles, to double 2@S here is penalty.  So that is out.
There are lots of gadgets to show a good heart raise here, but I think the simple approach is best. 
Just bid 3@h. 
You do not want to punish partner for making an overcall.
Now, we come to the second RULE this auction brings to mind: 
After you make a preemptive bid, your partner is in charge.
|
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  So if South pre-empted with 2@s, North gets to decide on bidding 3 or passing.  
And North should probably pass if she thinks South had a pre-empt. Why?|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


at|
North can tell that the defence probably has just 3 tricks if South pre-empted, 
and bidding 3@s will give E/W a chance to bid 4@h.
So the fact that South felt compelled to bid 3@s means his hand was too good to bid 2@s originally. 
|
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


nt||at|WestElsdon (Tom): If I bid 1@S should I keep bidding?
mitche: If South bids 1@s, then West can bid some number of hearts, and you will have the chance to compete later, 
with 4@S, probably. 
You know what they call an 8-card suit, Tom?  They call it TRUMPS.
3@s makes, most likely, with 1 @S, 1 @D and 2 @C losers.
|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


nt||at|BILAsst10: So 4@H's is good sac here?
mitche:  Yes, but you should not have to guess to bid it.
4@h is doomed because the @D suit has 2 losers, and 2 black Aces.|
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


at|
jaggermb:  Can you comment... how strong is South after 1@H bid?
mitche: 1@S shows 5+ spades and at least 7 HCP. With more spades, you may have as few as 5 HCP, 
but always at least 5 spades -- with only 4, negatively double.

at|mitche: Bidding: After the pass of 1@h by West, North has a difficult hand -- 1@s is the best alternative.
After West's pass, a vulnerable 2@h on East's hand is very aggressive. 
If West cannot find a bid over 1@h, then you're probably outgunned on the hand.  
And vulnerable and too flat, too.|

nt||at|mitche: After 2@h, I don’t know about passing with North's hand. 
I would try a reopening double. 
North wants to compete and possibly to push E/W to the 3-level.
South would bid either 2@s or 3@d with his cards.|

And if South did bid 3@c, well, then you need a new partner. :)
If North bids 2NT over 2@h, she will play there and go down 1.
East plays @HA and @HQ, and when in with the @DA, runs 4 more hearts. 
That is kind of double dummy defense, but it is also what deep finesse will find.

at|mitche: Play: What spade did North lead to give South his spade ruff at trick 3? |
pg| ***** 116 ***** |


at| 
North led the @S2, her lowest spade.
If North wanted a @D return, she could have led a higher spot card.  You have to watch these spots.
BTW, if North had no preference, she would return the 4, her middle remaining  spade.  
The @S9 would have requested a @D shift.
OK.. that is it for this hand.

nt||at|mitche:  Summary of important points from this evening:
a) remember Gerber 4@c 
b) remember suit preference signals
c) remember that responder's jump bid of 2 of a Major over opener's 1 of a minor is pre-emptive
d) watch the cards!     and hopefully, remember them :)
