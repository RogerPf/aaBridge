^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. 
My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, 
be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed 
to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|^b@2^*BLooking at Combined Strength ^*N


Last week we started asking the question: "How good are your high cards?"
To review a couple of key points:

FIRST PRINCIPLE: |cp|4|at|
"Other things being equal, honors are more valuable in your long suit than your short suit"|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


cp|2|at|

SECOND PRINCIPLE (Concentrated Strength): |cp|4|at|
"Other things being equal, honors in combination are worth more than isolated honors"|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


cp|2|at|

An example     Two 14-HCP hands:

Hand 1: @sAKxxx, @hAKxxx, @dxx, @cx
Hand 2: @sAxxxx, @hKxxxx, @dAx, @cK 

Which one would you rather hold? 
Obviously, the first one.
Partner's hand is @sQxx, @hQxx, @dQxxx, @cQxx 

Hand 1: @sAKxxx, @hAKxxx, @dxx, @cx - makes 4@S or 4@H around half the time;
Hand 2: @sAxxxx, @hKxxxx, @dAx, @cK  - is lucky to make 1 of either major. 

The same number of HCP, but at least 3 tricks difference in playing strength.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2 


With that as background, let's roll on.
We can move from here to the THIRD PRINCIPLE of Honors with Length: |cp|4|at|

"Other things being equal, honors are more valuable in your long suit than your short suit... 
^*BThe longer the suit, the more valuable the honors"^*N|cp|2|at|
Let's go one step further -

Another key part to evaluating your hand is:  |cp|4|at|^*b"How well it fits with partner's known length"^*n|cp|2|at| 
Suppose you have:      @sAKxxx  @hxxx  @dKxx  @cAx         and open 1@S 

Case 1: Your partner splinters with a bid of 4@C

Case 2: Suppose he splintered with 4@D

Case 3: Pard splintered with 4@H

What would your rebid be in each of these instances? |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|

Let's look at it this way.  Pard has about 14-15 dummy points.
In cases 1 and 2 your high cards are not working as well as you'd like (especially over 4@D)
The @CAce opposite a singleton is fine... but you have 5 losers in the red suits. 
Pard is not likely to cover 4 of them for a slam.

Over 4@H you have 3 losers in the minors, but your minor honors are opposite length ànd probably STRENGTH
So over the 4@H-splinter bid  5@C.   (Control-bid showing a 1st round control of clubs) 
If pard bids 5@D, you would be happy to bid 6@S |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||fp||cp|2|cs|3|at|^b@2
Now this leads to the idea in bidding:
"When possible, tell partner where his strength will be useful"
An example:     How would you bid these 2 hands?

Opener:      @sAJ   @hKQJxx  @dAxxx  @cAx 
Responder: @sxxx  @hA10x   @dKQJx  @cJxx

Suppose you open 1@H  which is overcalled 1@S 
Responder might bid 2@S  (limit raise in hearts), and 3@S by advancer:  1@h-(1@s)-2@s-(3@s)
Now, what should opener rebid? |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|

You have 19 HCP (with a useless @SJ) and pard advertised 10+ points with heart support. 
You are close to the slam zone, right? And the auction is at 3@S now...
Let's start with a control bid of 4@C, just to see if partner gets excited.
(If you control-bid, you should start with the cheapest control bid you can make =>  4@C)
If you bid 4NT, you may get lucky, but let's give partner a chance to say something important.
This lets partner show controls, too, while 4NT takes up a lot of bidding room. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|

And over 4@C, pard says 4@D showing first or second round control of @D's, which you know to be second round control, 
the @dK (or maybe a singleton, but not likely).

OK - now we can find out about the @HA with Blackwood...Pard has that card and bids 5@D (0314)
What now? Are we going to slam??
Opener has 4 controls so it must be the @HAce
Let's say we are going to slam.. 
So we bid 6@D,        NOT 6@H 
Why?|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||fp||cp|2|cs|3|at|^b@2 

We are going to give partner the choice of slams. 
Pard has no problem passing 6@D, which happens to be the only slam that makes.
You get 5 heart tricks, 2 black aces, 4 diamonds and a ruff! (12 tricks in all).

The idea here is that the 6@D says   "I have length here - You pick the best slam"
It is Bergen's idea of "pick a slam"   and it follows from the principle: 
"Tell pard where his high cards will be of most use".|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|

If you're offering a @D slam, you need to have some length in the suit!
If you had not had 4 diamonds, you'd bid 6@H (then pard's @D suit would generate a discard for your hand!!)
Pard might have clubs, but that is fine, too.. then you get pointy-suit discards.

Another example:  Partner opens 1@D 
And you have:     @sAQ10xx  @hxx  @dxxx  @cKJx      

You bid 1@S and pard raises to 3@S 
You are happy to raise to 4@S, which you expect to make opposite his 16-18 point hand.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


at|

Let's suppose your hand is slightly different:
@sAQ10xx  @hxx  @dKJx  @cxxx 

Same auction: 1@D – 1@S / 3@S..    Now what do you rebid?
Again 10 HCP ... 
But this time you should bid 4@D - Your hand got much better - knowing pard has diamond length. 
Opener: @sKxxx  @hx  @dAQxxx  @cAxx       and you make 6@D or 6@S 

The 1@D bid told you that your @D cards are working fully..  |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||fp||cp|2|cs|3|at|^b@2 

WestElsdon:  How do you know that partner didn't open with 3 @D's?
mitche: You do not know if he opened with 3 diamonds, but opener can look at his hand and realize you have 
strength in his long suit. 
That will help your pard drive to slam. 
And the idea is "high cards in pard's suit are working" 

(MM: 4@d control-bid (denying club stop, it còuld be a singleton, but more likely showing the @dK)

kat827:  spades were agreed upon....is there really a choice to have a @d-slam, or should you stay with spades?
mitche:  spades, because we have that 5-4 fit .. 
Opener:       @sKxxx    @hx   @dAQxxx  @cAxx
Responder:  @sAQ10xx  @hxx  @dKJx    @cxxx 

1@d-1@s
3@s-4@d
4@h-4@s
5@c-6@s    in comfort.

Next week, we will discuss an important idea: "In -  and out -  evaluation" - let's play!

pg| ***** 18 ***** |


sk||pc|C8|at|mitche: Bidding:  I think West would do well to bid 3@C over 2@S.  
With a useful heart card (pard opened 1@H, after all) and a decent 5-card suit, this gives you a shot at slam. 
You won't bid it (no one can show a @D control), but West is worth 1 move toward slam.|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt||at|Should N bid 2@D? |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


at|
I think that a 2@D bid is a poor bet. 
Reason: You have only 5 diamonds and an 8-loser hand, and both opponents are bidding.
If you have @DAQ10xx, then maybe 2@D would be OK, but even then, I would be cautious.
kat827:  If W responds 1@S, doesn't that just promise 4 spades, so should E bid 1NT not 2@S?
mitche:  As a matter of style, I think that 2@S is OK....|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt||at|Remember the 2NT gadget we discussed last week?  
West can find out if opener has a 4-card support if she wants to.
Example:  1@H - 1@S/ 2@S - 2NT asks opener to show spade length and overall strength. 
With 3-card support and poor controls, bid 3@C over 2NT.
With 3-cards and good controls, 3@D.
And with 3@H and 3@S showing 4-card support with poor and good controls, respectively.
Here, E would bid 3@C (3-card support, only 2 quick tricks).|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


nt||at|MM: The other option seems to be a 1NT rebid by opener.
IF responder is interested, he could use NMF (1 or 2 way), CBS or x-y-z     for example

up|36|pf|y|at|mitche: Play:  The opening lead of a club (on the auction we had) is probably correct.  
A heart is a poor idea, and leading from the @DA is too risky for my blood... or anyone else's, 
unless they are riverboat gamblers.
So on the @C lead, declarer should win the first club in DUMMY and play the @HAQJ to discard 2 diamonds. 
Then she can play spades. 
And if someone ruffs the third round of hearts? Well, you traded 2 diamond losers for a diamond and a trump.|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt||at|The way declarer should think about this is: 
If I play trumps, the defense might grab its Ace and see no hope in hearts or clubs, so they'll get their 2 diamonds.
The chances of hearts breaking 6-1 are just about 6%, 
(MM: And 6-1 in north is fine, as you can over ruff south if needed be =>) 
so I am pretty sure of getting rid of at least 1 diamond and maybe both of them. (when 4-3 = 62%)

at|mitche: Bidding: I suppose that West wants to tell pard about that nice @D suit... 
but here, I would cue-bid 3@H to show a good spade raise.
5@H turned out to be a worthwhile save, since E/W can make 6@s
They do not want to bid to 6@S, but they would take 12 tricks if they did (on a @h lead).
West might bid 4@H, splintering, but I would like to save the bidding space.
W has a hand that needs very little (@DK, @CK and @SA) for 6@S to roll.|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


nt||at|The 3@D bid was not bad, by the way, 
but if W recognizes that E has 6 spades for her 3@S bid, she might bid 5@S over 5@H
The general rule of thumb in competitive auctions:|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt||at|At the 5 level, if you think the hand belongs to you 
- and have just 1 loser in the suit that your opponents are bidding, you may go on.
- If you have 2 losers, you pass, 
- and with 3 losers in their suit, double.
This way, you avoid getting too high when you have too many cards in the opponents' suit.
WestElsdon:  Is that a variation on the law of total tricks?
mitche:  No, LOTT is based on trump length.  |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


at||nt|Mitche:  BTW, the Law breaks down when there are lots of trumps.
Here, for example, N/S have 10 trumps and can take 10 tricks,
E/W have 10 trumps and can take 12 tricks - 20 total trumps, 22 total tricks. :).
Mike Lawrence wrote a book, "I fought the Law (of total tricks)" - good book!

sk||pc|H2|

at|mitche: Bidding:  After the 1@D opener and 1@H overcall, West has a pretty good hand. 
The way to show a good hand with diamond support here is to cue bid 2@H; 
Since 1@D might be a 3-card, West will have 5 diamonds for the bid. Here it would work very well.  2@D would be West's bid if we removed the @HA from her hand.|
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


nt||at|So just to summarize:  
Suppose your partner opens in first or second seat.  Your RHO overcalls.  
You may cue bid the overcall suit to show 10+ dummy points and support for opener's suit.  
That is pretty much standard bidding in both SA and 2/1 (in precision, when you open 1@H or 1@S, also)  
After 2@D, East has a pretty decent hand (18 HCP and a good diamond suit). |
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  3@D would be right if E lost the club Ace, 
but with that card, she should think about game.  
And the best way to get there would be to bid 2@S instead of 3@D.
East knows that West cannot have 4 spades, and West knows it too.  
So 2@S shows extras (either very strong or very distributional hand.|
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Why can't West have 4 spades?
If she had 4 spades, she would make a Negative Double.  
No negative X, no 4 card spade suit.
So 2@S by East shows a really good hand (or really distributional hand).
For Anyone a Sherlock Holmes fan.... remember the dog that didn't bark in the night?
No bark, no 4 spades :)|
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


nt||at|All right. So East should be bidding 2@S.
West, looking at good cards in hearts and clubs should bid some number of No Trumps.. 
Remember, West undercooked her hand with 2@D 
The auction might be: 1@D (1@H) 2@H (pass)/ 2@S (pass) 2NT (pass) / 3@D – 4@D / and then E/W will get to 6.

up|38|pf|y|at|mitche: Play:  Declarer guessed well to finesse the @HQ at trick 1. 
She then finessed against the @DQ, losing. 
BOO, HISS!!! (sorry, my New York is coming out!!) 
E/W have 10 diamonds between them, leaving 3 for N/S AND N followed to the first diamond. 
E can play the Ace. 
If S shows out, so if the @D suit split 3-0, she can play @SA and ruff a spade to finesse the diamonds.
So declarer always has 5 diamonds, 2 hearts, 3 clubs, the spade ace, and 2 spade ruffs in dummy|

The key point in play: Declarer knows, once a small diamond appears from N, she can always pick up the @DQ

MM: By clicking on the cards, you can play the hand Double Dummy.

at|mitche: Bidding:  West was contemplating what to bid over 1NT.
Marty Bergen makes the point in his lessons: 
The worst thing you can do with a balanced hand is to bid over 1NT.
Taking action over 1NT requires a distributional hand. 
So West is pretty much compelled to pass.|
pg| ***** 95 ***** |


nt||at|Let's look at it a different way.  
West has 14 points, South 15. 
How much does that leave for North/East?  
At most 9, and for West to do OK in play, East would need 7 of those 9 points, leaving N with a bust hand.  
But if N has a bust, then 1NT will play very poorly for North/South.
So RULE 1: with a balanced hand, pass when RHO opens a strong 1NT on your right.

up|36|pf|y|at|mitche: Play:  Had N/S been playing 1NT, then maybe a diamond would be OK (just maybe.. ).  
But to underlead the @DA is more often than not, suicide...
First, you may allow declarer to win a trick with the unsupported @DK.
Second, you won't ever recover the trick you blow by under leading an ace.
So RULE 2: Never under lead an ace in a side suit against a trump contract.
Or, as Mike Lawrence put it. NEVER LEAD a side suit headed by an unsupported ace |

nt||at|I would lead the @C10 with West's hand. 
It gives nothing away.
Later in play, when W got in with the trump Queen, she shifted to a spade. 
That also could have cost a trick.
West can reason as follows: |
pg| ***** 110 ***** |


nt||at|Dummy has 5 points, I have 14. 
That leaves 21 points for E and S; 
S has 15-17 of them, leaving 4-6 points for partner, and I have already seen the @DK.  
So declarer MUST have the @SAK for her 1NT bid, and I need to get out as safely as I can.
The diamond, giving up a ruff-sluff, may have turned out correctly, just in case S had a doubleton heart 
so I am not nearly as concerned with that play.
The key idea here, for the defenders: count declarer's points.|
pg| ***** 111 ***** |


nt||at|A NT bid helps the defenders assess their partner's strength very accurately.  
Remember to add your points to what you know declarer has and what you can see in dummy 
that will help you know your partner's strength.

MM: By clicking on the cards, you can play the hand Double Dummy.
