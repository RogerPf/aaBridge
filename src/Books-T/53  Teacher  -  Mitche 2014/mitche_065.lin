fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in the back yard), 3 (spoiled) recue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."
Mitch Edelman aka mitche 



MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.
Thank you Eileen (wyoming33) for sending the hands and editing the chatlog! @h

|mb|1H|mb|p|lb|*bWhat should South bid?^^3C|mb|3H|at|mitche: South has a Bergen 3@C bid (7-9 support pts and 4-card support).  
If not using Bergen raises, South should bid 2@H, as South's hand is a bit too thin for a limit raise.

pg| ***** 9 ***** |


sk||at|mitche: Bidding: Let's start with a quick review of Bergen raises, which I recommend as part of your 2 over 1 repertoire.

When  partner opens 1 of a major (1@h or 1@s) in first or second seat,  and your RHO passes, then
a) a double raise to 3 is WEAK, showing 0-6 points and 4-card support,  
b) 3@C is a 4-card raise with 7-about 9+ dummy points,  
c) 3@d is a 4-card raise with 10-12 dummy points, and  
d) 2NT is Jacoby, showing 13+ dummy points and 4-card support of opener's major. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||

at|mitche:  So South has a Bergen 3@c bid.
In the actual auction, South bid 3@h, which I guess was intended as a limit raise.

South's hand is a bit too thin (9 losers) for a limit raise, so if you don’t use Bergen, then 2@h is enough.
A Bergen raise to the 3-level always shows 4-card support;  rarely, you will have a 5th card. 
After a limit raise to 3@h, North reevaluates his hand and it comes to ... 15 HCP plus 3 for the singleton. |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||
At|mitche:   South would need to have a singleton @D and the @SA 
(or controls in both spades, diamonds, and a trump Q) to make 6.
So North, if he thinks 3@h was limit, should just bid 4@h. 
Responder could have the magic  hand, BUT it is not good bridge to try to stretch to a doubtful slam. 
Mike Lawrence, one of the all time greatest players said: 
"Don’t play me for the perfect hand, partner, I never have it."

at|mitche: Play: If East wants to lead clubs, the right card is the 3, not the 7, at trick 1. 

Reason:  Leading the highest spot  (the 7, since west can see the others) denies an honor in the suit.
With that information, West should win the club ACE at trick 1 and shift at trick 2 to a high diamond. 
In summary,  important points for this deal: 
a) BERGEN RAISES and 
b) Lead LOW from three to an honor in a side suit.|

at|mitche:  Bidding:  Should West bid 1@D or 1@h, after 1@C by East?
If you bypass a weak @D suit, using "Walsh style" responses, you're with the majority of modern bidders, 
If you bid suits "up the line", then you're with a large group of players.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


at|
geeeoo:  What is the advantage to bypassing the diamonds?
There are advantages to both approaches|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt||at|The main advantages to bypassing a 4-card @D suit with weak hands are: 
a) get the Major in quickly,  
b) get pard off to the correct lead, and  
c) especially if responder has spades, you preempt the opps at the 1 level.  
It is easier to overcall the auction 1@C - 1@D than it is to overcall 1@C - 1@S.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt||

at|mitche:  The advantage of up the line is you clarify your shape and get the stronger hand to declare more often.
calligal: So most would bid the @d's before the @h's?

mitche:  I think most would bid the @H suit.  There is a lot more about Walsh style - 
you may find information by googling Walsh style responses.  There are so many traps in bidding 1@d 
Walsh style.. for example, opener will frequently hide a 4-card Major in the auction 1@c - 1@d by responding 1NT.|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  If responder has a 4-card Major and doesn’t bid it, he has enough strength to reverse.
I don’t like that approach, because while I will bypass a 4 or even 5 card @D suit with a weak hand, 
if I am 4-6, I won't distort my shape that much.

I intend do a paper on Walsh Style bidding in the next couple of weeks.  Will announce when it's done.

at|mitche:  Play:  Declarer discovered spades split 3-3 and should have cashed the winning @S6 early --
but the club play is important.
Then declarer should probably play the club suit before going after spades, and the way to do it is - club 
to the ACE and then a club toward the @CQ.
More important, if the @CK gets played by North then the declarer has an entry in spades to hand to cash the @CQ.

SK||

at|mitche:  Bidding:  West has a pretty good hand, I think we agree.
It has 18 HCP and 6 losers (plus the extras in spades, clubs, and hearts that are not counted in losing 
trick count) The hand is worth 2@S or 2NT, depending on the  methods you play.

Were West to bid 2NT, say, showing 18-19, East could add her 13 points to get 31 - 32, meaning slam is 
going to be kind of thin (no good fit for diamonds in East hand, no 10's or 9's) so the final contract would 
be just 3NT, not the riskier 4NT.|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  But since West undercooked her hand by about an ace, she felt compelled to raise to 4NT.
bjh346: Is that a quantitative bid?
mitche:  And yes, the raise is quantitative, but also, if West "had" her 1@S bid, an impossible bid!!|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


at|
gypsy1308: I took the go slow approach as was pard's first bid.
mitche:  Go slow is fine in a ^*uforcing^*n auction, to show extra values.  But you need to bid your values when you want to force
to game, and if East has any kind of 1@h bid, you want to get to game; 
So bid what you have and that is  2@s (or 2NT, if you use a checkback method to locate an unbid Major).

at|mitch:  Play:  The Opening lead was a small diamond.  I think that it's better to lead the @CJ.  Why? |
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


at|
a) 4-card sequence is safe and 
b) the opponents bid diamonds. We don't want to lead their suit when we have a better lead elsewhere.

One more important point. 
Declarer had 3 spades, 3 clubs, 1 diamond and 2 hearts, needing just 1 extra trick.
So I suggest taking the @H finesse first. If it works, you don't need the @D hook to get to 10 tricks.|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  As the play developed, declarer played off the hearts before taking the @D finesse.
Better not to spend your stoppers in side suits before taking a finesse.
If the @DK were offside, then declarer had set up 2 heart tricks for the defense.
Alternatively, take a diamond finesse before you cash the hearts.
geeeoo:  If 4NT is quantitative,  how would you ask for aces?

|sk||

at|mitche:  Bidding:  Rule of forcing bids: In SA, 2 over 1, ACOL, and pretty much every system I know: 
a new suit by an unpassed hand is forcing for 1 round.
Playing 2 over 1, bidding the 4th suit is forcing  (4SF)
Let me clarify the new suit, new level, by saying that a new suit by unpassed RESPONDER is forcing. 
for example: 1@C – 1@S/ 1NT - 2@d is 100% forcing on opener.
New Minor Forcing...The convention we are using.|
pg| ***** 103 ***** |


nt||at|(However there are simialar conventions like Check Back Stayman (CBS) or Two-way Minor Force.
When playing one of these conventions, you may argue that a 2@h rebid by responder is non forcing, highly constructive. 
I think that it should show 5-5 with at least invitational values 
(I may be in the minority here; the alternative is to jump to 3@H with 5-5 invitational)
(2-way Minor Force resolves this problem)|
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


nt||at|1@C    1@S
2@C    2@H ? 
Opener has shown a 6-card club suit and a minimum. 
This MUST show 5-5 or better in the Majors (Responder will pass with a minimum and any number of clubs). 
This is the classic “when you are in a hole, stop digging".    So bidding past 2@C shows. 
  
|
pg| ***** 105 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Why do I mention this?  
Because 2@c by West was "4th suit forcing". 
West could have had a club void for that bid!|
pg| ***** 106 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Opener is expected to make a descriptive bid.  Here, 3@c would have been the best bid.
Raising the 4th suit shows 4 and no particular desire to declare notrump, 
and that is precisely what East has. |
pg| ***** 107 ***** |


nt||at|
If East had a 3-card @h support, she would bid that first.  
Then on a balanced hand (with a stopper), NT (particularly if opener's first bid suit was a minor)
With neither of above "do something intelligent" (i.e. make the most descriptive call possible)
For ex. raise with a 4-card in the fourth suit (never beyond 3NT though), or even rebid a 5-card suit if necessary

And the spade suit will generate a discard or 2 for declarer.  What's left? The diamond suit.
(MM: Though you might very well think partner has a few clubs left, and can overruff
However, if P had the @cJ, she would have taken trick 3 with the J and not the K)

at|mitche: Play:  Defense could have won a diamond that it did not. 
How should the defense know?
A heart cannot possibly help - declarer will trump it.
South led the @S7, which once again is top of nothing, so the @SK is marked in declarer's hand
This idea of leading low from strength in play, especially when dummy's spades are so strong, 
can be used to "deke" declarer and try to fake her out of taking a normal finesse.
(i.e.: Leading a low spade to make declarer think you hold the honor)|

But make sure partner won't be deceived into blowing the defense :)

|sk||
at|mitche: Bidding:  West's unbalanced hand looks hard to bid.
But it has a 4-card Major, so she should start off with 2@c.  
If pard bids spades, no further problems - we just shoot for 4.
And if opener bids something else, bid 3NT.
Guess your 6 card club suit is going to work.  And if not, well, too bad. 

My philosophy is to be an optimist in the bidding when there is a decent chance of a happy outcome.|
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


nt||
at|ecolodge:  Would you open North hand weak 2 nonvul?
mitche:  No, I would not open a weak 2.  Here is why.
I have no honors in my suit and I have 9 points outside it.
Some players are perfectly happy with a weak 2 with North hand. I am not one of them.

at|mitche:  Play:  The @SQ is a standard lead, and declarer's hold-up was correct.
When North shifts to hearts, ducking is also correct.
Now East wins the @S continuation and must take the club finesse sooner or later, right?
What happens if she runs the clubs immediately, and North could slip the @DA into the South hand.
Now, when declarer finishes with the clubs, she must come off dummy with a diamond. |
pg| ***** 138 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  South will save her good spades and the @DA and - - the contract is sunk. 
Here, if the @DA and @CK are both off, the contract is dead.  
So declarer must put one of those cards in South's hand, and the one it has to be is the @CK.
Therefore, she must cash the 3 hearts before trying the clubs.  
If the club hook loses, well, that's life.  Maybe North will have the @DA.
But if South has that card, it is imperative that declarer cash her hearts first. |
pg| ***** 139 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Down 1 or down 3 is irrelevant. But making the contract is worth the risk of a couple of undertricks.
Moral:  Preserve entries to the hand that needs them -- don't just assume they'll be there.

BILAsst10: How do I show @S?  Do I bid 1@S?

I agree with East's 1@d and 2@d bids, mostly, but West should bid 1@s over 1@h.
a) she has a good suit, one that might be happy to play a 4-3 fit  
b) she wants spades led.
Be that as it may, 3@d was over 2@H.

at|mitche: Play: South should, if she decides to lead spades (the unbid suit) start with the @S4, NOT the @S3.
Tell partner you have a doubleton small - the 3 followed by the 4 shows an odd number of spades.
Next, declarer's first 4 cards should be the @SA, @CQ, @SK, @CK (throwing a heart) and @CA (throwing a second heart)
Now the contract is pretty much assured, with 4 black suit winners, and when spades are 3-2, a 5th black suit winner.  
Then she can afford as many as 3 trump losers.|
pg| ***** 159 ***** |


nt||
 
at|mitche:  How should declarer know to play that way?
She knows that the defense will find its heart winners as soon as they get in 
(they can see 4 winning black cards in dummy).
And declarer can be pretty sure that she will lose a couple of trumps, too.. 
Well, here, the tipping point is that declarer cannot deal with 4-1 spades, 
so she may as well just try to cash outside winners to ditch those hearts.  
Alternatively, she can play a trump first, but she has to use the clubs to discard losers.|
pg| ***** 160 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Having just 5 clubs, she is a bit unlucky if they split 6-2 (so the defense ruffs a club winner.) 
But the ruff is a natural trump anyway.

Thanks to Eileen for her generous assistance and to all of you for your courteous attention and participation.
