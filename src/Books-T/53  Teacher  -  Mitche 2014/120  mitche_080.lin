fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department).  Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue 
(who loves puttering with the plants in the back yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.  Mitch is also an avid 
amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.  Mitch is currently an active bridge player, and joined the BIL's Mentoring Team 
February 24, 2010.  His "Play and Discuss 2/1" sessions are most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player.

"When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."
Mitch Edelman aka "mitche" 


MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.
Thank you Eileen (wyoming33) for sending the hands and editing the chatlog! @h

pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at|mitche: Bidding:   1@d, 1@h and 2@d were all book bids. What should West do over 2@d pass, pass?
I think that passing over 2@d may be forced, but I do not like the pass over 1@h.
I would consider 1NT, if it is natural, double if it's not.

Turns out that E/W can make at least 2 spades (losing 2 spades, a heart, diamond, and club)
Definition of takeout X is support for unbid suit(s), and Axx and Kxx are support. 
If West passes, she will frequently find herself giving up -90 or -110 when she can make +110.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  N/S didn't look for NT so there is reason to suspect that East has some spades or clubs. 
The late Ron Anderson had a rule: NEVER let the opponents play at the 2 level in an uncontested 
auction.
BILAsst10: My pard couldn't say anything over 1@D and I know if she has anything she will bid.
mitche:  Not necessarily so. She may not be able to overcall 2@c (showing 10) or have enough of a
spade suit to overcall. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||
at|BILAsst10: Sometimes one can't do anything about 2 level bids - maybe they are losing a game and 
don't know it.
mitche:  With West hand, they aren't missin a game :)

at|mitche:  Play:  N/S are scheduled for 9 or 10 tricks, depending on how declarer plays trumps.  
So declarer quite reasonably played off the trump @dAK and that was that.
WestElsdon:  Better to do the finesse in @D first?

mitche:  With no opposition bidding, there is no reason to favor finesse over playing for drop.
The thing is, if West were short in diamonds, she might have balanced, so that might tip the scales 
very slightly in favor of a finesse. But that is a very tenuous assumption.|

at|mitche: Bidding:  I don't mind the occasional 4 card overcall, especially if the suit is spades. 
So good idea, East.
But (and this is a big but) you should have better shape than 4432 
-- perhaps a singleton in one of the opponents' suits.
Marshall Miles book - I think it was titled "Bridge in the 21st Century" - is a big advocate for 4 card overcalls.
(MM: M Lawrence in "the complete book on overcalls" discusses 4-card (1-level) overcalls, this hand would NOT qualify)|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Most people play that a jump to the 3 level in overcall suit as we saw here with 3@s 
= asks for a full stopper.
Unless you explicitly agree that the cue bid shows half a stopper, you may be stuck finding 3NT here.
Meckwell uses the immediate jump as asking for a partial stop, but this depends on an understanding that someone 
must bid NT with a full stop.
|cp|4|at|Question: Can one assume that south would have rebid any number of NT with a full @s stopper, rather than rebidding 2@d.
And in that case, the 3@s would be asking for half a stopper ?|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt||cp||at|

Even though 3NT is on for 10 tricks, it's very hard to reach, especially after the 1@s call.

at|mitche:  Play:  N/S are once again headed for 10 tricks against any defense, no more, no less. 
Declarer's line was perfectly reasonable. 

One last point:
After the lead of the @SA, how should East signal in spades?
If the Ace asks for attitude (it does) then East must play the 2, followed by the 3 to show PRESENT count.|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  You need to agree how to deal with this problem:  
there are situations where East clearly might want a spade continuation after the A and K
(i.e. to prevent declarer from repeating a finesse), 
so you should agree with your regular partner how to encourage or discourage continuations in suits. 
This is very important, because defense is more difficult without agreements on common defense problems.

at|mitche:  Bidding:  South might want to double over 1@c to get the spade suit in play early, but 1@h is also OK.  
Now, when North bids 1@s, South has an easy raise to 2.
Since North is a passed hand, South should not bid any more than 2@s.
When the auction runs back to East, should she pass or do something else?|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


at|
1NT was the correct call over 1@s ... This shows the 18-19 HCP hand. 
Since East bid her values with the 1NT bid, she is right to pass.
She limited her hand and West can bid if she has a reason to.|

at|mitche:  Putting it a different way, after the auction reached 2@S,

at|mitch:  Play:   East's Opening Lead is kind of suspect: South advertised at least a 5 card suit. 
So leading hearts helps set up declarer's suit. 
Better to try to build up tricks in your suits before declarer gets the hearts going.
So yes, the @DK is a better idea. Your heart winners aren't going anywhere.|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


nt||at|
One comment on declarer's play.  He use the @HQ to ditch a @D and simultaneously set up the @HJ for a discard. 
I think that he should cash (or try to cash) the @HJ when West signaled low (= odd).
(in stead of ruffing a heart)
With a doubleton or 4, West might have high-lowed.  And if East does ruff, it could be with a natural trump trick.

sk||

at|mitche:  Bidding:  There is something to be said for 3@c over 1@c, showing a weak hand with long clubs.  
Since North must have at least 3 of them, it should be OK.
North has got a good hand, and if South has the @CQ instead of the @CJ, then 3NT may make.  
So N/S were a bit unlucky.
BUT North knows that South has pretty much nothing outside of clubs, 
so he needs to wonder where he is going to develop 2 or 3 tricks.|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


nt||at|
Since South promises a club bust, it would be better, I think, to thank partner for her bid and play 3@c.
Pretty standard now for 1@C - 3@c to be weak, especially playing 2 over 1.
Most pairs play "inverted minors", where 1@C - 2@C is a strong bid.(limit raise or better)

at|mitche:  Play in 3NT:  The @s5 was the opening lead.  
Most people play a low card shows either an honor or extra length. 
So West might try leading a second spade instead of a heart shift.
The reason is that declarer will need to play hearts himself, either out of his hand or by finessing.  
West wants to establish East's spade before her potential entry is removed.|

|sk||

at|mitche:  Bidding:  North has a "Bergen 20" and a 1@c opener. So that was fine.  And 1@h is surely correct.
What about 2@s?
It is preemptive, but is it weak?
What do you think?  Should Bob bid 1@S or 2@s?|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


at|
OK - here is something to think about: East passed, so there is very little chance for E/W to bid and make game.   
We agreed on that?
So West made his bid, he took away a chunk of bidding room.|
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  I think it's perfectly reasonable for West to bid 2@S preemptively, but not weak, 
showing zero outside aces or kings as long as East is a passed hand.
A two-level preempt is usually 6 cards, but that spade suit will play pretty well opposite a small doubleton.
North rebid his 6-card @C suit (aggressive, but with tolerance for @h's, not completely unreasonable).
East should bid 3@s over 3@c.  Partner advertised spade length, after all.|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:   If the bid is preemptive and weak, N/S might have a game somewhere, and in fact, 5@c makes,
And in fact 3@s also makes. 
Lots of facts here. 
OK, so 3@s is a good idea..|
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


nt||
at|btour:  Only problem with 3@S is that it sometimes forces them to crash into the game when you show the fit -
mitche:  They have to bid to the 5 level -- Not easy.
If you preempt you have to recognize that partner will push with a big fit.
And here, if I were in East seat, I might bid 4@s with favorable vulnerability.
Trust me, at favorable vulnerability, you stand to gain more than you lose by raising spades with the East hand.|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  The point of preemption is to make them guess.  
If the opps have a slam, they will find it more easily when partner passes than when you take up 3 levels of bidding.|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


at|
Once again, Stansby's advice: "I just bid my hand and leave the hard decisions to partner."
WestElsdon:  Should I have understood that the 3@H bid was only promising 5?
mitche:  With a 5-card suit, South needs another honor to rebid 3@h. |
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  In essence, you're willing to play hearts with pard holding @hJx, 
and with the club fit, maybe 4@c is a better idea than 3@h.
Also, 3@d would say, "I would like to try for NT.. but I need you to have a spade stopper

btour: If my pard bid 3@S or 4@S how many losers would south count in the spades suit?
|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Oh, if East raised spades... South still counts 3 losers.. 
North would evaluate his hand as 6 loser.
That is where that 3@d bid would help.. It might ease N/S into 5@c.

Remember that East didn't raise spades, so West thinks that South has a few of them.
Declarer now has to play carefully to make the hand.
She can play as follows: 
After the heart split is revealed, she set up her suit by knocking out the @HQ.  
East properly played spades to tap declarer and promote a trump trick for herself.  
She should continue playing clubs and leave the @DA alone.|

at|mitche:  East will eventually have to ruff in with her trump, and when she does, 
she will be endplayed, forced to lead away from the @DK.
In other words, clubs become "trump substitutes" - declarer uses the established club suit 
to get the defender with long trumps to ruff and restore "trump parity."

MM:  By clicking on the cards, you can play the hand Double Dummy, 
please click the  ^$40 for the next board |

at|mitche:  Bidding:  Let's begin with 1@d.
Marty Bergen might agree with 1@d if East planned to rebid 2NT.
The hand is probably too strong for 1NT (15-17) opener, with 17 HCP, and 3 10's and a 5-card suit.
You should still rebid 2NT after the negative double.|

And if you play weak NT, you MUST announce it.
msphola:  I announced it when we sat down, also, and alerted it.
mitche:  So, the East hand is still too strong to bid 1NT (or rebid it if you play 12-14 opening 1NT).|
pg| ***** 110 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:West has an automatic negative X. 
Over the neg X, East should bid 2NT, not 1. 
Why? Her hand is worth much more than 17 points, as mentioned before, and she has a heart stop.
Back to our actual auction:  
If you play weak NT, then you might also play that East would have to conceal a 4-card spade suit.|

nt||
at|mitche:  That is a poor idea, because it is MUCH easier to bid when you know you have a 4-4 major suit fit.
btour:  Yes so 2@C is check back, and we have agreement that opener would jump bid the spades next if has 4.
mitche:  I understand, but I disagree with the idea. |

You are forced to discover your fit after 
a) giving the opponents plenty of opportunities to double for lead and 
b) get preempted.|
pg| ***** 113 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Finding the fit may be more useful. Sharp opponents will take you to the cleaners.
Anyway, your partner bid 1NT, which should promise a heart stopper. 
Bidding 1NT after someone has overcalled should guarantee a stop.
So 2@h by west serves no purpose, as West also has a @H stop. 

So I think that if you play weak NT, the auction should be 1@D (1@h) X (p)/ 2NT - 3NT.
If you play strong NT, you should have the same auction.

at|mitche:  Play:  The opening lead of a small heart turns out to have given declarer an easy time of things.
(A new book by David Bird, Opening Leads against NT contracts, does computer simulations of hands and deals.. 
I think that the computer simulations suggest that a low heart is correct here.)
Anyway, after a low heart, declarer just knocks out the @D honors and claims.

Thanks to Eileen for her generous assistance and to all of you for your courteous attention and participation.
