MM: The recommended screen resolution for .lin movies is 1440 x 900 pixels 
(rightclick on your desktop,select "personalize" "screen defenitions")
Also, make sure you have "widescreen" checked in your windows BBO-version
(If you're not sure about your settings log into your BBO windows version then:  
click the yellow tool at bottom and under the "general" tab check "widescreen" and save)
This will prevent the "cutting off" of the bottom parts or scrambling of your text in these presentations.

If you downloaded BBO recently, you will not be able to get online with the windows version...
You can still change or check your settings: 
Go to your C disc, and under "programs" find the Bridge Base Online folder
Open it and find the "profiles" folder
Open and scroll to find: BBO_Default_Settings 
line 71 should read: WIDE_CLIENT=1
If your setting is 0, change it to 1 and save.

fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, 
if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. 
We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. 
My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, 
so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving 
and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."


Mitch Edelman aka   "mitche"






MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.
Thank you Eileen (wyoming33) for sending the hands and editing the chatlog! @h

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1S|lb|*bPlease click West's bid on the right^^3S|at|Western Cuebid asking partner to bid 3NT with a spade stopper -

pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||mb|d|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|sk|w|
at|mitche:  Bidding:  Let's ask what the double of 1@S was.  
I'm guessing that West thought it was double - for penalty with an opening hand (well, nearly),  
opposite an opening hand.  
But, in Standard American,  the double means something else: Negative double:
It says "I have 4 cards in hearts" and at least 8 points (to force the bidding to the 2 level). 
That is 8 HCP,  plus whatever distributional strength I have.  In this auction, the double promises hearts. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: So a Negative X promises 4 cards in unbid majors.  
Some people say it might promise 4-3, but I disagree (call me old-fashioned);  
I find that with 4-3 in unbid majors, I may just bid 1 of the major I have 4 of.  
For example:   Had this auction started 1@C – 1@D, I would probably bid 1@s 
(MM: A X would promise 4-4 in both Majors in this auction)
or a natural 2NT, if my @D card  was a King instead of the Queen.
I really love being able to make as descriptive bids as possible.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||
at|ecolodge:  So could you please tell me how the auction should have gone?
mitche:  I was waiting for that... 
After 1@C – 1@S,  I would probably bid 3@S with my regular partner, which means: 
"bid 3NT with a spade partial stopper".|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


sk|e|at|   And opener would bid 3NT, which makes, as it turns out.
Western cue-- the auction goes -- 1plum and an opponent overcalls in grapes.
A cuebid at the 3 level (3 grapes) says - if you can stop grapes, bid 3 fruit salads (3NT).|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


sk|w|nt||
at|So you are asking for pard to look specifically at spades when you bid 3@S, the overcalled suit.
Alternatively, if you don't bid 3@S, you should pass and hope partner reopens with a double. 
As it happens, 1@S goes down a trick or maybe 2. 
But West could never convert 1@S-pass-pass-X into a penalty double.
If W passes and E reopens with a double, then W should bid 2@S - again, saying "pick your contract".

at|mitche: Play: North did well not to ruff the spade opening lead.  It allowed E to win the ace and lose 2 spades later. 
Apart from that, play was quite normal -- 
Except for 1 thing, South should duck the @DJ as that limits declarer to 1 diamond trick, not 2.

at|mitche: Bidding:  Well, it looks like 6@H or 6NT are both cold.  How can E/W get there?
Let's see -- after 1@H – 1@S, what does 2@H say? |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


at| It says "6 hearts" and a minimum hand.
How "minimum" is East's hand?  East's has 5 or 5 1/2 losers, right?  
And a heart suit that plays for 1 loser opposite a singleton, yes?  
East has enough strength to bid more than a modest 2@H.  I think 3@H is fair. |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt||

at|mitche:  After 3@H, West has a whale, with 4 working cards 
(West would bid 1@S even without any of the club cards).  
East's 3@H bid says I can play "heart suit trump" for 1 loser opposite a singleton heart.  
So West knows the @HK is gold.
West would bid 4@C, saying "I have club control." East bids 4@D (I have  a diamond control), 
West should then bid 4NT, and the final contract will be 6@H.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt||
At|ecolodge:  Yes.  What is the standard rule for "powerful enough"?  Number of losers?  Strength of major?
mitche:  Well, A suit that plays for 1 loser (KQJ10xx) and 2 more controls (aces or kings) is enough.
Here, the 7th heart is adequate compensation for the missing other control.
This is a bidder's game, and with a powerhouse hand, it pays to show strength.

Note that 3@H is invitational, showing 16-18 HCP usually.
Here, you have just 14 HCP, but the @H suit is so good, I will bid 3, not 2.|

So there is nothing to the play, except for keeping the entry situation in mind.  
Declarer must win the first club in  hand, cross with the spade (NOT heart!!!) and then overtake the @HK..  
Well done!!

at|mitch:  Play:   Declarer is looking at a fair number of losers-- 1 or 2 diamonds, a spade, and a trump.  
So how can he make the most of dummy's resources?|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


at|
Once declarer gets lucky (very lucky) in diamonds, he may as well play a heart to the ACE (not the @HK), 
and then play a heart from dummy, planning to let it ride. 
If West can win the 9, then declarer's K will remove the last trump.
If East ducks, then once again, declarer loses just 1 trump.
Why should declarer think to do this? |
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  West has announced length in clubs, and she did so after a 1@H opening.  
Preempting with length in the suit bid on your RIGHT (hearts here) is not the best idea, 
because those cards may be useless for offence - but valuable as defensive cards.
That is a pretty important idea -- |
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


nt||at|The "death holding" in preempting is 3 small in the suit bid by the opponents -- 
and 4 to an honor is better suited for defence.
The point is, declarer should play East for heart length.

at|mitche: Bidding:  8 points opposite an opening 15-17 1NT is a touchy number of points.
If pard has a maximum and a 4-card fit for one of East's Majors, then game may be on.
So East probably should bid 2@C , especially at IMPS scoring.  After 2@D, East should bid 2NT.
- In a previous lesson we learned - If East has 5-4 in the Majors and an invitational hand,
she bids 2@C and over 2@D bids her 5-card Major.
Here, with 4-4 in the Majors,  East's best idea is to bid 2NT over 2@D.|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


nt||

at|mitche: Play:  Not sure what I would lead against 2NT.  
North can work out that E/W have 23 - 24 HCP or maybe a very bad 25 -- 
with 6 points, North can reason that South has 10-11 HCP. So far so good?
Next - North has 6 spades, and how many do E/W have? 
2@S's by E should be 5 of them (see earlier discussion), and West has 2 or more for the NT bid. Right?
So North can conclude that South has at most 1 spade, probably none.|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  What does that say about the chances of setting spades up?
Pattipat: Nil, but didn't want to finesse my partner 
mitche:  OK - if you want to make a passive lead, that is one thing,  but a better shot is to lead a small heart.  
At least there you have a shot at developing a trick.
It would be very anti-percentage to lead a minor.  
It may not work out on this hand, but in general, you're better off leading a Major that the NT side 
is less likely to have.|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Here, a passive lead won't hurt, but it won't help, either.

at|mitche: Bidding:  If your style is for sound opening bids in first seat, 
then S must open in third seat with her hand - just in case partner passed a decent 11 point hand or a bad 12  count.
So 1@C is pretty standard in third seat.
- In particular, South has spades, so she isn't quite as worried about being outbid at a low level.
What should West do after pass - pass 1@C?|
pg| ***** 95 ***** |


nt||at|West has a full opening bid, shortness in clubs, and decent support for any unbid suit 
so he should bid a takeout double.
Some of you are saying, "But what if East bids spades?"
Well,  you play @s's in your 4-3 fit,  that is what happens :) 
North has what can be described as a terrible hand - all quacks, 9 losers.
So North should not bid 3@C.  Why? |
pg| ***** 96 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  The club suit is OK for a 3@C preemptive raise, BUT -
a) N/S are vulnerable, and the defense may decide to double for a 1 trick set and 200 points.
b) North has the worst possible shape for the 3@C bid - 332 in the side suits.
When you preempt, you should have some distributional strength. A singleton or void is best.
And 5422 is the flattest shape you should ever hold for a preemptive raise.  
And if you do preemptively raise with 5422 shape, you should have a side suit like KJ9x or so.|
pg| ***** 97 ***** |


nt||
at|mithe:  West should compete for the part-score and if she does, E/W will play in a peaceful 1 or 2@D

at|mitch:  Play:   Declarer should make sure of her diamond ruff by leading a diamond at trick 2.
One last point for the defense - when East overruffed dummy at trick 10, she had 2 spades and the master @D.
She should lead the diamond.  Declarer must ruff in dummy, and then she loses the last 2 spade tricks.
East can recognize the need for that particular line of defense as follows: |

nt||at|If declarer has the @SK it doesn't matter what she does.
Also, the @D10 is the highest diamond.  And South is out of trumps, so the @D play cannot cost a trick-- the spade might. 
Note that these kind of inferences require the defenders to count declarer's hand.|

nt||up|40|pf|y|at|Can 3@C be held to down 1? 
I think it can if declarer ruffs a diamond and guesses to do everything perfectly (so the @C10 is shut out).

at|mitche: Bidding:  There are several ways for East to show her giraffe.  
One of them is just to double 1@H, which must be a distributional takeout.
Second: East is a passed hand, so 1NT cannot possibly be a strong, balanced hand. 
So if E were to bid 1NT, it would show a 2-suited hand.
The difference between X and 1NT should be that: 
- 1NT should show less defense, 
- X should show 2 good-ish suits.|

nt||at|If E held the @DK instead of her 6 rags, then a double would be the best idea. 
With the weak distributional hand, use the sandwich NT.

Also, some people think that double should be less distributional than the sandwich NT, 
so that the doubler's partner might be willing to defend with the right hand.|
pg| ***** 121 ***** |


nt||at|With her wild 2-suiter, East should involve partner in the decision where to play.
1@S makes it harder for E/W to find diamonds when that is correct.
Your strength is fine. 
It is your distribution that makes the sandwich 1NT preferable.|
pg| ***** 122 ***** |


nt||at|Now, after 3NT (a bold bid), 
East may pass - or if she does bid, she should bid 4@D, not 4@S.
West knows about East's 2-suiter. So 4@D allows West to play in their better fit at the 4 level.
4@S makes it rather hard to play in 4@D -- like real hard, you know :)
After E bids 4@S, S may decide it is time to double. 
With 2 sure @D tricks and 2 probable spade winners, 4@S is not going to make.|
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


nt||at|East may have 8 spades to the AQJ.  Doesn't the @SK10xx turn into 2 tricks then?
Well, 4 tricks is usually enough.  And partner did bid, too.
West's 3NT, by the way, was a reasonably good shot.  I like that bid!
Put the @DK in East's hand and it is just about cold.
Karen10: On what would South have opened then, or on what would N have found a 1@h-bid? :)
