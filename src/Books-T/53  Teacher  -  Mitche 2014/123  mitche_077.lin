fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department).  Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue 
(who loves puttering with the plants in the back yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.  Mitch is also an avid 
amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.  Mitch is currently an active bridge player, and joined the BIL's Mentoring Team 
February 24, 2010.  His "Play and Discuss 2/1" sessions are most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player.

"When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."
Mitch Edelman aka mitche 


MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.

|at|mitche:  Bidding:  1@S by West is thin. I don't have a problem with it, because West has a 5 card suit, 
but I would not fault West for passing, either.
Now, East's hand - after 1@S, I would give some thought to 2@s, not 1NT.
Why?    Why this terrible heresy -- raising partner on only 3-card support?! 
anniebmisc:  My question is about bidding 1NT when I have no rebid ... 
looking for New Minor forcing, which is better.     Don't think Partner plays NMF.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  1NT is a reasonable rebid, but I think you may wish to consider 2@s for these reasons:
a) with Axx and a worthless outside doubleton, East can probably take a ruff;
b) If N/S want to get into the auction, they have to do so at the 3-level, 
which may allow you to buy the contract cheaply.

OK, so East bid a not-too-unreasonable 1NT and West passed this time, also correctly.
Should that end the auction?|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||
at|gehrhorn:  I think North may balance with a double
mitche:  Yes, North should reopen.
Why?|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at| 
E/W have found a parking place at the 1-level.
North has 11 points and E/W have around 22 (and in this case, considerably less), 
so South is marked with at least 7 points.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: North has very good support for either unbid suit, and the @SK10 rate to be worth something after West bid 1@S
So North should balance in with a double.
South will bid just 2@C.
Why only 2? |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


at|
The balancing doubler "borrows" about an ace's worth of South's strength to make the double. 
So South needs a full opening hand to make a game-invitational bid.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  If South were to bid 2@c they might buy the contract there.
Over the balancing X, East goes quietly and might find 2@s over 2@c.

2@s will go down 1, most likely, while 2@c will make, very likely 3 as the cards lie.

at|mitche:  Play:  What was the opening lead?
gehrhorn:  2@c
Right, a small club.
It is reasonable for North to think that the lead promises a picture card in the suit.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


at|
Why?
a) leading small from 4 small is hardly a popular choice of leads.
b) (hint) -- if we happen to have an unbid MAJOR worth leading, we prefer leading it.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: OK, so North might reason that since East has the @CQ10, playing the @cAce allows declarer to take a trick 
if South has led from  @cKxxx.  
But if south has led from @cKxxx, playing the @cJack will keep declarer from taking any club tricks.
So play that @cJ when pard leads low.|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


at|
Next, it was a good idea for North to continue clubs. 
The only way declarer gets to dummy is with spades or clubs, so removing the club entry probably kills dummy.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: Next point on defense -- When North got in with his @S10, he finished the @c's and got out with a @h.. 
Which one?|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


at|  It was the @H8 -- Better is the @HQ.
Finally, when South scored the @HK, he exited with a small diamond.  Once again, the lead of an honor will 
guarantee an extra trick for the defense.  Declarer will have to lead away from his @DJack.
The key points here:  Do not let the opponents play at the 1 level if you have any excuse for bidding.
And remember that the lead of a low card, especially against a NT contract suggests length or an honor.

sk||
at|mitche:  Bidding:  I wonder -- if East thinks her hand is worth a game raise to 4@s, 
would it make sense to bid 4@d to show the singleton?
What do you think?
anniebmisc:  Probably should 
mitche:  Well, what else could 4@d be? North bid 2@D naturally.
ecolodge:  Don't know splinter with any reliability.|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt||
AT|mitche:  Learn them!
Lesson 1 about a splinter: 
a) A double jump in a suit is a splinter bid.
So 1@h-pass-3@S is a splinter bid in support of hearts.
And 1@H-pass-4@C is a splinter bid in support of hearts.|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


at|
b) If the opponents overcall pard's 1@h opening bid (2@c), then 4@c is also a splinter bid in support of hearts.|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  next:
c) either partner may splinter.  (support = 4+ card support, under special circumstances 3+) 
Here's an example of a splinter by opener: 
1@C-pass-1@h-pass
4@D = a splinter by opener in support of hearts, showing about 19-20 dummy points AND a singleton diamond.|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt||at|
If you plan to bid to slams, you need to know what a splinter bid is and when to use it.
East can splinter.
West passes 4@s (correctly, I think).

at|mitche:  Play:  Leading the @CK is looking for a ruff.
But for North to get a ruff, South has to have a fast entry in trumps, not likely in this hand.
Maybe the @CK will set up tricks for the defense, 

In any case, the @CK is probably the best lead on the hand, whether North gets a ruff or no.
Declarer should not worry about ruffing diamonds, but rather should just set up hearts.  |
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt|| 
at|mitche:  Reason for not ruffing @D is that if he ruffs a @D before playing trumps (and they happen to split 3-1),
it will be very hard to both set up hearts and enjoy an entry to cash them.
But watch: declarer wins the @hA at trick 2, plays 2 (or maybe 3) rounds of trumps, and then 
leads the @hQ.  That guarantees 11 tricks. 
As long as declarer preserves a low trump (the 3) to use the @S5 as an entry, the contract always scores 11 tricks.  
Or declarer can ruff a diamond after setting up hearts.   But the key is not to ruff that diamond too soon!|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: How should declarer think about the hand?
He sees 5 losers in hand after the @C lead, so he knows that he will need to find some extra tricks. 
He also knows that he can't use all of dummy's trumps to do that, because the @SJ then will win a trick - 
so the @h suit is a source of tricks.
He also knows that dummy's only entry is in trumps.|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: So he can reason that a trump must be there for a late entry, after hearts have been established.

|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


SK||

at|mitche:  Bidding:  East has a pretty decent hand, with 10 HCP and a singleton in the overcalled suit.
So her best bid is not 2@d (which is a pretty weak bid, showing not much more than 4 or 5 diamonds and 6-8 HCP),
but 2@h. 
2@h should mean either "limit raise or more in @D" or a hand too strong for me to bid my own suit over 1@h.
This is a very common situation, where you are responder and your RHO overcalls.
Anyway, since East did not negatively double, West knows that East has not got as many as 4 spades.|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


nt||

at|mitche:  West still bid 2@s. That bid must be forcing.
Over 2@S, East should bid 3@c.
West might bid 3NT over 3@C, which has the advantage of making 9 or 10 tricks, depending on the defense.
So the sample auction might be 1@d (1@h) 2@h p/ 2@s (p) 3@C (p) / 3NT all pass.
Remember, 2@h showed a good hand.|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


nt||
at|gehrhorn:  Is the only reason West's 2@s bid is forcing is that it's a reverse?  
Or is the fact that East raised diamonds and they found a fit...thus new suit is forcing?

mitche:  Well, 2@s shows extra values.  I think it should be treated as a 1 round force.

at|mitch:  Play:  There are a couple of interesting lines of play at 2@s, West could opt for a crossruff,
playing a heart at trick 2 (or maybe a club and a heart to hand).
Alternatively, play 2 rounds of trump (with the Q and A) and then play diamonds, so the defense can ruff a 
diamond, but then declarer preserves trump control.

When declarer actually ducked the @CJ, she traded her @h loser for a @C loser. 
If the defense continues clubs, it will do at least 1 trick better and I think maybe 2 tricks better.

sk||

at|mitche:  Bidding:  What does raising opener's weak 2@s to 3@s mean?
It is a weak bid, showing spade support (maybe as few as 2) and is intended to keep the opponents from getting 
in cheaply.
Here are some rules of the road after a weak 2:|
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


at| 
a) a raise is not forcing;  
b) if you are an unpassed hand, a new suit is 100% forcing
-- it shows a good hand and probably some tolerance for opener's suit; |
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


nt||
at|c) a bid of 2NT is also forcing and asks the weak 2 bidder to describe her hand. 
The simplest treatment is to use "feature asking (FA)."
How does that work?|
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


at|
- Opener rebids 3 of her weak 2 suit with a minimum weak 2.  
- With a good suit (2 of top 3 honors or 3 of top 5, i.e. KQ10xxx or better) AND an outside K or A, bid the outside suit.
Example:  KQ10xxx, Kx, xxxx, x.  The spades are good, so bid 3@h over 2NT.|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


nt||
cp||at|mitche:  Responder will then know whether to bid 3NT, 4@S or maybe 3@s to sign off.
Why do spades need to be that good?|
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


at|
Responder needs to know if the opener's suit is good enough to run in NT.
Here, if you play FA opener would bid 3@s over 2NT (no outside A or K). 
Basically, the advantage of showing an outside control  is to allow responder to evaluate her hand for either 
game or partscore in the opener's suit or No Trump.|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


nt||
at|gehrhorn:  related to a) RONF, is it also true that after 2@s (p) 3@s (p), opener is prohibited from bidding 
again (e.g., 4@s by opener is not allowed, responder is captain)?

mitche:  Yes, that is true, after you preempt, your partner gets to make all the tough decisions.
The preempter has bid her values.. A weak 2 shows between 5-10 HCP, so there isn't much room for outside honors,
if your weak 2 is "disciplined."|
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Later on in your development, you may want to use a different bidding style for preempts, but for now, 
you will be better off with sound suits for your preempts.
ecolodge:  Is East hand too powerful for a simple 4@S bid?
mitche:  Should East bid 4@s directly?  Well, how many losers does East have? 

I would count 6+, because the unsupported @HQ is a potentially useless card. 
Count @hQ as a loser when she is unaccompanied by at least the 10.     So 6 or 7 losers. |
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  What does the weak 2 bidder have with a sound suit? 
You can generally expect a 7 loser hand with the preempt.
So a 7 loser hand by RESPONDER is usually enough to give you a play for game.  So yes, East can bid 4.

Now you know Feature Asking - use it (or Ogust, if you and partner both know it).

She should play just 1 more round of trumps, saving the 2 in dummy to ruff out the clubs.
If she does this, she wins 6 spades in hand, the @CA, @DA and 2 club ruffs in dummy for 10 tricks.
calligal: What saved the hand was the cross ruff.
mitche:  Yes, but if South has a second heart, then perhaps she has one less @D.

at|mitche:  Bidding:  East's double of 1@C says "support for all unbid suits", which she has,in a manner of speaking. 
But I would not double on that hand.  I would bid 1@d.
Why:|
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


at|
a) the major suit support is sketchy, and  
b) the hand is too weak to double and then bid @d's.
- When you double and introduce your own suit, as E's bidding did here, it promises a hand that is too strong to make a simple overcall.|
pg| ***** 105 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Generally, since most people play that an overcall shows some range like 7 - 16 or so, 
the sequence of (double => bid your suit) promises at least 17 points.

East's bid led West to bid 3@d with her hand (which was really quite weak, since the @CK might have been worthless), 
but the bid was justified.

at|mitche:  Play:  South decided not to lead clubs. I agree. 
If I believed the E/W bidding, then a trump might be better, since West would probably be weak with 3 or 4 trumps, 
and East is marked with strength. 

Leading a spade might destroy the N/S spade holding ... As it is, the spade went to the Ace.
What did North return at trick 2?  It was the @S8.|
pg| ***** 119 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Third hand (North here), when returning opening leader's suit, should give count.  
That would be to return the original 4th best card, here the @s4.
There are exceptions (having honor sequences, for example), but from Axxx or Kxxx, if you win and decide to return that suit, 
return your original 4th best.
I might return the @HA at trick 2,  and then a second heart if I were north. 

South bid hearts, so I think I want to lead partner's suit and hope he has the @HK and can give me a ruff.|
pg| ***** 120 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: When declarer led the @CJ, South went in with the @CAce.  
I would duck in the hope that declarer is planning to run the J, in which case the defense gets 2 club tricks.

If you have a count and expect the declarer to have a singleton, that is a different story, but here, when you raised clubs, 
Tom, had your pard held 6 clubs, she might have bid over 3@d.
OK, so on this deal, 2 lessons: double and bid your suit = very good hand, 
and on defense:  returning opening leader's suit. |
pg| ***** 121 ***** |


nt||
at|WestElsdon:  Could the 8@s be a sign that Kate did not have another honor?
mitche:  Not necessarily - with A10xx or even AJxx, it's probably right to return 4th best.
With say @SA109x, then the @S10 would be the right card to return.

at|mitche:  Bidding:  West has a pretty decent hand in support of spades.  
I think I'd announce that with a 3@c cue bid - limit raise or better.
If opener has a better hand, say something like AKxxx, Kxx, Axxx, x, you might miss slam with the 4@s bid.
3@C here in response to OPENER's bid and South overcall shows LR+ (Limit Raise or more) in support.  
Even with 5th spade, I would do that.

at|mitche:  Play:  Declarer should still make the hand as follows:  
After the first 2 tricks, win the club return and play @SA to remove the last trump.  
Then play a @D toward the king. You lose 1 trump, the heart, and the @DAce.

If the @DAce is behind the king, too bad, but you may as well play South for that card, because he has no points in hearts, 
4 points in spades, and if he didn't have the @dA he would have a  maximum of 7 HCP.
When someone makes a 2-level overcall, you should put a minimum of about 10 HCP in that hand.|
pg| ***** 136 ***** |


nt||
at|kat827: For South's hand - is it suitable for a 3@C weak jump overcall?
mitche:  South has a cruddy @C suit, but a singleton @h.  Well-placed @S and the @DAce.
So he has an excuse for 2@c, even with that swiss-cheese suit (hole-y).
In general, a preempt should have more points IN the suit you're preempting than OUTSIDE of it.|
pg| ***** 137 ***** |


at|
If you have better defense, don't preempt in front of an unpassed partner.
So no, South does not want to preempt.|
pg| ***** 138 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Also, when you do preempt, you suggest that you want your partner to lead the suit. 

We had a lot of interesting points come up tonight. Please think about them. 
Thanks to Eileen for her generous assistance and to all of you for your courteous attention and participation.

MM: You can play the hand Double Dummy if you wish
