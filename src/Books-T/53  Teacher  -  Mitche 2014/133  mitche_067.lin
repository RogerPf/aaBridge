fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch and his his wife Sue live in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore, together with 3 (spoiled) recue cats 
and aquaria.
Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.
Sue loves pottering with the plants in the backyard.

Mitch is also an active bridge player who learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament
bridge for graduate school, career and marriage.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player.

mitche:
"When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

Mitch Edelman aka mitche 



MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.
Thank you Eileen (wyoming33) for sending the hands and editing the chatlog! @h

sk||at|mitche: Bidding:   When the auction returns to East after 1@S, pass, pass, what should he do? 
(a) pass  
(b) double      
(c) 2@d|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|
BILAsst10: What would a double show?
mitche:  The REOPENING double here invites West to do something smart.  
It shows spade shortness and tolerance for the 2 unbid suits; here   @c and  @h.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  So I would not pass with East cards - (a) is out.  
Double is the most flexible.    East should double, since:
a) It allows West to pass with a good spade holding and a misfit, or
b) bid a 4 or 5 card @H suit when she is too weak to bid it freely, or  
c) Do something  else smart (1NT, 2@d... )|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Now, should South overcall 1NT? 
I would not object strenuously, because the hand looks no-trumpish.
So South could bid 1NT, and if N/S agree that they are playing "systems on" with 1NT overcalls (you should), 
then I would be OK with 1NT.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: There are advantages to both 1@S and to 1NT overcalls.. I like 1NT.
1NT clarifies strength and @D cards.

Note that a 1NT overcall will get North to transfer to @h which is a pretty decent contract,
and East-West would be defending  2@H's|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||at|gehrhorn:  The 2@s rebid?
mitche:  I do not like 2@s, since South has what looks like a defensive hand. 
The @DQJ10 are useless in a @s-contract, and the @h's also look like weakness on offense. 
So South should pass and give North a chance to do something (like pass, here).

sk||
at|mitche: Bidding:  West's 1@h was a shade aggressive, but I think OK.  
If you play matchpoints, the 1@h bid is essential.
The 1@s shows 5+ of them.  I might point out, if North had just 4 spades, he would have made a negative double.
So 1@S shows 5+.
Most people play that 3@h by East is preemptive. 
|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  So better would be to make a cue bid of 2@d to say 10 points, 4 card @h support 
-- save 3@H for a preemptive raise.
Here is the problem that a cue bid solves: 
West could have had a pretty decent hand for the 1@h overcall, something like @sx, @hKQxxxx, @dxx, @cAJ10x.
And when East bids 3@h, West will think N/S have more strength than they do.  He may pass 3@H when game is cold 
(although with a 10-card heart fit, West should probably bid 4 in this example anyway). 
|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  But the 2@D bid says that East has some strength, allowing West to better judge whether to bid game, 
double a spade contract, or save.

Let's say West has @sxxx, @hKQxxx, @dxxx, @cKx... then he would know to take a sacrifice over a 4@s bid by N/S,
since 3@h promised long hearts and no defense.

|SK||

at|mitche:  Bidding:  We recall that 2@d is game forcing...
So South wants to get to the best contract, and South doesn't know about North's hearts. 
South should bid 2@h to announce to the world, and especially to partner -- "I have 6 hearts".
(MM: Unless you agreed that 2@h is your fall back bid, then you are not promissing 6 yet)
mitche: Since they are in a game forcing auction, North cannot pass 2@h -- agreed?
OK, then North bids 3@c and South can raise to 4 clubs.   1@h-2@d/2@h-3@c/4@c-
Why 4@c? Why not 5@c?|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: 4@c is stronger than 5@c, and South has 16 points, a working @DQ, and that @SAce, too.
So yes, slam is possible.
Whether they can find it, 4@c gives North the chance to bid something useful like 4@d 
(a cue bid, showing first or second round control of  @D's).
South loves that, and will bid 4@h (first or second round heart control). 
4@s by North, and South can just about bid 6@C all by himself.    (4@c-4@d/4@h-4@s/6@c)
More likely, South bids 4NT and they arrive at 6@c that way.|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt||at|
(MM: Would N bid 6@c after 4NT, showing an odd number and a void in higher ranking? Given the void is in partners suit?
Or would N bid 5@c = 1 ? This then shouldn't get South to bid 6@c with 2 Aces missing and not knowing about a void
When South cuebids the @s then North is better placed to bid the slam, P did show extra's)

|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


sk||

at|mitche: Bidding:  First, let's ask a question.   Do you think 1@h is forcing or non-forcing here?
I think that since South is unpassed, it is most useful to play a new suit as a 1 round force, 
showing tolerance for overcaller's suit.  
Had South been a passed hand, then 1@H should be non-forcing.|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: North should probably bid 1NT over 1@h.
South would then bid 2@d and North would pass or raise, depending on how good his hand is. 

N/S can make 3@D, by the way. |
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  You should discuss this auction with your regular partner to make sure you are on the same page.  
Some pairs will play 1@h as not-forcing, but I don't agree that is the best treatment.  
Without discussion, it is forcing.

at|mitche: Play: First, South should do some counting.. with 24 total points in N/S hand, and West opening the bidding, 
where is the @DAce likely to be?|
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


at|
West
Since West did not bid 1NT, East is likely to have at most 4 points anyway, 
and with an Ace, most people will find some excuse to bid.
Remember that!  It will locate the spade, diamond and club Aces here.|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Why do I mention this?
When West led a small heart it also confirms that he has all 3 Aces. 
When the @h9 holds, declarer should just finish trumps and lead a diamond to dummy 
(do not horse around with any side suits until you establish your long suit)  
and win the @DK and lead a small one. You are sure that the @DA is onside.
If the diamonds are 2-2, you are home.  
You may as well play for 2-2 since West did not find a call over 1@h he is likely to be balanced.|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  It is very, very tricky here.   The inferences are: 
- If West has 3 Aces and some distribution, he won't sell out to 1@h, so he is probably balanced. 
- If he's balanced, then diamonds are likely to split.  
They might be 3-1 but when West leads a small trump and shows up with the @hJ, had he had the AQ of diamonds, 
- he might open 1NT.
So if the diamonds really were 3-1 then East will have the singleton Queen.|

A Reversed Drury 2@C response by East would show a limit raise with 3 trumps support |

|sk||

at|mitche: Bidding:  First, I wonder if you know 2-way reverse Drury.   If not, learn it.
East has @h-support and about 11 dummy points, right?
He is a ^*upassed^*n hand => 
a) 2@c is not game forcing, right?   And... 
b) a non-forcing 2@c is not likely to be the final contract.
You can make an argument that 2@c is useful to show a hand with clubs and 10-11 points, 
but I think it's more useful to reserve 2@C and 2@d by passed hands for 2-way reverse Drury.|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Perhaps it's a matter of style, but I think Drury is really more popular than using 2@c and 2@d by passed hands 
as natural, especially if you play 1NT as forcing by passed  hands.  It is very popular in tournament play.
Even if you just use 2@C as Drury, you're ahead of the field with it.
Anyway, here is what the bid means: pass - 1@h / 2@c shows a 3-card limit raise 
and 2@d (instead of 2@C) shows a 4-card limit raise.  
Then opener bids 2 of his Major to say "not interested in game".. any other bid is at least invitational - 
I play them as help suits.|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  So pass - 1@h/ 2@c - 2@d says "I have a hand that would make a help-suit try in diamonds... "
That's pretty much all there is to Drury.

at|mitche: How should declarer play?
First, he counts his losers -- a couple of spades, a heart, a diamond, and a club. That is too many.
How can declarer make 2 losers vanish?
If the @CK is onside, then the club loser goes away. 
And if not, then the clubs produce an extra winner. So declarer should finesse at trick 1.
South should NOT return a club. There's no chance at all that the club led was singleton.|

at|mitche:  A spade looks OK, or perhaps a trump at trick 2 is much better. 
Anyway, if the defense shifts to anything, declarer should win it (no heart finesse today, thank you) 
and then cash 2 clubs and discard a loser. That brings the winner count to 2 spades, 2 clubs, and 5 hearts.  

Then it is easy to ruff a spade for the 10th trick.
Declarer loses 1 heart, 1 club, and either a diamond or a spade, depending on how the defense cashes its tricks.

at|gehrhorn:  I would have gone down 1 if South hadn't played the 9@s at trick 7. 
mitche:  Exactly right, George.     No reason to play the @s9
And you should have ditched a loser earlier on clubs.

at|mitche: Bidding:  South should pass 1NT 
- If the auction dies at 2@d, he can balance with a double (so North can bid hearts with 4 of them).
2@s is pretty unilateral, since it doesn't allow South to get North's opinion on what might be best.|

Similarly, West's 3@d bid 
a) put E/W in a poor spot and 
b) didn't allow East to help with the bidding.|
pg| ***** 116 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Also, 2@s could have been a disaster.  
West could have an 18-19 point hand, and 2@s doubled, vulnerable might cost a telephone number.
So West has nothing to say over 2@s.  Pass with his minimum hand with 7 losers and a defensive looking spade holding.
The @SQ is not going to be very useful for a @D contract, so West has just 10 working points.

gehrhorn:  I couldn't really figure out what South could have that would have made him bid 2@S after a passed hand. 
I thought my partner had 7 cards in the minors, so rebidding diamonds would be ok.  But passing did cross my mind.|
pg| ***** 117 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  If East has a minors-oriented hand, he can bid it over a pass. 
But 3@d pretty much takes away any options East has for bidding 

For West to bid over 2@S, he should have a 6 loser hand or better. 1NT could be as many as 10 losers!
So beware of the 3-level on semi-balanced minimum hands.
You all have heard the saying, "the 5-level belongs to the opponents"?
Well, in competition, so does the 3-level, unless you have a 9 card fit.

at|mitche: Play: The contract was down 1 before West got going.   
And when he won the @HQ he SHOULD discard the club Ace, take a diamond finesse, and if it wins, 
play his small club to dummy to allow him to repeat the finesse.

Thanks to Eileen for her generous assistance and to all of you for your courteous attention.
