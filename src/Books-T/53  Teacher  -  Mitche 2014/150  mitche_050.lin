^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, 
if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. 
We will also discuss play from declarer's and defender's perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. 
My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, 
be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives:  "to acquire bidding judgement and avoiding common mistakes in play."

fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f The Negative double  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|^b@2mitche: OK, welcome back from last week.
In the interim, I wound up tripping out.    Actually just tripping.   In the garage, over a power cord. 
Broken wrist and kneecap. Nuts!!!
BILAsst10: we shall have to go easy on him
mitche: Don't let up. Just because I waddle and type with 1 hand doesn't mean I stopped being a target

Lesson time            Tonite:  ^*bThe humble negative double^*n.


One of the most common problems you face in bidding is holding a hand like:  @sKJxx @hxxx  @dQJxx  @cxx 
Your partner opened  1@C  and your RHO over-called  1@H 
What to do? 
Obviously, we want to get spades into the picture.     But 1@s here should show ?      What should it show, anyway?

When partner opens the bidding, he may have as few as 11 or as many as 20-21HCP, 
so responder tries to give opener a chance to bid again whenever possible. 
If second hand overcalls or doubles,      opener will have a chance to bid again, 
and there is less pressure for responder to bid. 

Historically, when responder bids over second-hand interference, it shows about a King more than if no overcall 
had been made. 
So a 1-level FREE BID shows about 9 points and a  2-level free bid is 11+ HCP. 
Another old-fashioned idea is that double  by responder is for penalty. 
But be honest - when was the last time you held  @sxx  @hKQ10xx  @dAxx  @cKxx  and heard your RHO overcall  1@H? 
Probably not this year - or century! 

So the NEGATIVE double takes a bid that's almost never used and ^*bretools^*n it 
=====>>>>   to show a hand holding 4 cards in any unbid major and no convenient bid. |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2 

So with  @sKJxx @hxxx  @dQJxx  @cxx   after:   1@c - (1@h) - we  double to convey the message: 
"4 spades" and any strength from 6 to 40 HCP. 


NOTE: Some pairs play that a negative X promises tolerance for both unbid suits, but this is not a good idea. 
You could have a hand like this someday:   @sKQxx  @hx  @dxx  @cAJ10xxx 
If pard has something like  @sAJxx  @hxxx  @dAx  @c KQxx,    you have a pretty good play for  6@s, 
even with just 24 HCP. 
If you can't get spades in here, you will find it real hard to get to game, let alone slam, 
because the next bid is going to be 3@H no matter what you do as responder.

So, What does this mean for our bidding?

A: when we do bid 1@s, we have 5+ spades
B: when we double we have exactly 4 spades, no more, no less. 


OK -- So far, so good, but we need to look at one more auction:   1@C - (1@D overcall)
Suppose we do not have 4-4 in the majors. 
What're we supposed to do with our sample hand:    @sKJxx @hxxx  @dQJxx  @cxx 

We cannot negatively X because we don't have 4-4 in the majors.
We do not want to pass with this hand. We will never be able to catch up later.
We need to bid:     and we make the same bid we would have made without the overcall. 

Modern bidding treats the auction 1@C (1@D) 1@S as showing 4+ spades and 6+ points minimum. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2 

Next:     ^*b2-level negative X^*n

When the bidding begins something like 1@S by pard, 2@C by RHO, then a negative X promises 4 hearts and about 8 points. Once again, the negative X is unlimited in strength. 

Now, a free bid of 2@D or 2@H promises 5 cards or more and 10+ HCP. 
Sometimes when you lack the strength for a 2-level free bid, you will make a neg X with a 5-card major, 
for example:   @sxx  @hKJ10xx  @dQxx  @cQxx 

(But note - some pairs like to use negative free bids to show this kind of hand. 
This means they use a neg X to show good hands. 
But while this is popular, it is not yet widespread outside of expert or tournament circles.)  

Most pairs play negative X through 2@S    Some will use them at the 3 or 4 level, 
but I like to be able to penalize the opponents when I have points and the hand looks like a misfit. 

I have a couple of survey - type questions:
Do you know what negative free bids are and do you use them?
If you don't know about them, I will save the topic for  fuller discussion later on. 
They are not part of standard bidding, so I would like to save the discussion until you are all more expert 
with standard stuff
OK - someone asked for definitions

Recall earlier that we talked about giving opener a second chance to bid, because an opening 1 bid can be anywhere
from 11-21 HCP?
If second hand bids, then opener is guaranteed another bid, and we don't need to stretch to give him that chance
So if we bid, it is a "free" bid.
In older-style bidding, a free bid shows extra values, about a king more than minimum
A "negative free bid" is limited. 
At the 2-level, a "negative free bid" shows 6-9 HCP, 
At the 2-level, with more, as responder, you start with a negative X|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

Example:  1@S - (2@C) -    and you have   @sxx  @hKQxxx  @dxxx  @cKx 
- Playing negative free bids you bid 2@H
- Playing standard, you neg X.    Even with 5 hearts, because the hand is not big enough to bid 2@H freely 

BILAsst10: So you have an agreement with pard - do you have to alert it as free bid?
mitche: A negative free bid isn't alertable, I think. 
I don't see anything on a cc for "negative free bids"  ..

at|mitche: bidding: Let's look at 3@S first,
N has an 8 loser hand
She could have had a 9 loser hand, so the invitation is perfectly normal.
Putting it another way, she would have bid 1@S without the @CK, right?
Being 1 trick above minimum as responder, with 5th trump and extra values, 3@S is pretty conservative, in fact|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||at|But opener could be lighter than he was, so 3@S looks right
Should opener accept?  He has a 7 1/2 loser hand, so it's pretty close. I would bid 4 because of the hand's texture. 
So 4@S looks normal, 
The duplication in clubs is unlucky (change @CQ to @HQ and 4 is much better bet).

at|mitche: Play... when E led the @HA, she may as well continue the suit. 
It's hard to read the 6 as encouraging, but nothing else looks all that attractive.
Declarer made the mistake of switching horses mid-stream
What was that? |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |

She finessed in spades and then decided to play the ace instead of repeating the finesse|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: I once took lessons from the late world master Nancy Gruver, and she told me: 
Either play ace and out or repeat the finesse!
Either line would hold trump losers to 1
So you are getting the lesson for free that I paid a world-class player to get: DONT CHANGE HORSES MIDSTREAM!!
BTW, Nancy also taught world champion (and former partner) Beth Palmer|

at|mitche: Play: I would have led a spade queen instead of the @DQ. 
First - I have the @S9, so chances are I will not be blowing a trick. 
Second, E/W bid pretty strongly, and as we see, unless pard has diamond strength, 
the lead from @dQJx can be costly
Declarer took full advantage of the lead for 3 overtricks. 
Should S have led a club?     Only if he peeked.
Note that the finesse of the  @D10 doesn't risk the contract, which always has 10 tricks. |

There are advantages to both bids.
But after 2@H, I wouldn't bid 3 of the other minor.
It should be treated as fourth suit forcing, asking opener to do something smart.
If N bid 32D, S would bid 3@H
And then N would be wise to bid 3@S, showing a strong doubleton.|

at|mitche: East's hand is too strong to open 1NT, so she bid 1@D, planning to rebid strongly.
West should have bid 1@H -- it is rarely correct for responder to hide a 4 card major.
Some folks might want to pass with W hand, but 1@H is really the best idea.
If W bid 1@H or 1NT,   N might give some thought to a club overcall. 
She should not think very long about it...|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


nt||at| Pass with 2 bidding opponents and a partner who could not find a call  over 1@D
After 1@H, I think East's best bid would have been 2@S, preparing to raise hearts later. 
But over 1NT, promising 6-10 points (as most of you play it), I would blast off and bid 3NT with East's hand
Yes, 3NT, your hand is a balanced 18 opposite a 1NT bid. Pard doesn't have the majors. What's left? 
Clubs and diamonds, most likely|

at|mitche: But we are in 2NT.  How should declarer play after the club lead showed they split 6-0?
gypsy1308: I actually would have gone for Spades  true
mitche: yep - when @CQ wins, W can set up 3 spades and should do so -- if N has the @SA, she can't lead clubs without surrendering a trick, and if S wins it, she can't return a club
Note that leading a spade brings declarer's count up to 6 tricks|
pg| ***** 102 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: Declarer played a small heart at trick 2. 
S should hop up and go after diamonds immediately.    Then the @SAce will be an entry to the suit... 
Also, Declarer should allow South to hold the @DK and the @DQ if he continues the suit
Now, a third diamond would give declarer 2 tricks in that suit
Finally, at trick 10,  declarer knows that N has nothing but clubs remaining, so it would be safe - essential - 
to play a small club to endplay N |

at|mitche:  Play:  : Leading a heart seems normal - 4th from longest and strongest - 
One can make a case for a spade lead, but a heart seems right to me
Partner is not broke, so the defense will get in more than once.
And when W got in with the @SQ, she should take advantage of being in to shoot a second heart thru
There are 2 ways to think about continuing hearts:|
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


nt||at| First, there's no compelling reason to break a second suit for declarer and second,  
You would like to knock out the entry to the diamond suit before the  @DAce is taken out of play
Also, pard will appreciate your returning her suit :)|

at|mitche: Bidding: When the bidding comes back to E in the balancing seat, I think the best idea is for her to double.
KQx in spades is as good as 4 small.. and this allows W to vote on what's best.
BILAsst10: She will say 2@H - if anything
mitche: Right.. but at least you know that is her best guess as to trumps. |
pg| ***** 138 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: East's hand is a 5-loser hand, as I count it - 1 in clubs, hearts, spades, 2 in diamonds..
So I might risk a 3@H bid instead of passing 3@C.. after all, N/S has a fit (N raised) so E/W do, too
East would like to defend 3@C.. but I think her hand says "offense" with shortness in the opponents' suit. 
If E/W use Bergen's strategy, W might have bid 3@H preemptively (4 hearts, 0-6 HCP, and outside singleton)
But that is not going to be a majority opinion, I think.
BILAsst10: not with 4@C's --  ops suit.....if @D ops suit then yes - 3@H|
pg| ***** 139 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: North would not raise with 2 card support. 
By the way, I would not have bid 2@C with S hand.       S has 20 HCP
He should double 1@H and when pard bids 1@S, he should then bid 2@C to show a hand too strong to bid 2@C directly
BILAsst10: anyway - you are much more aggressive than I am – with all that strength behind me and vul – I'm bailing
mitche: faint heart ne'er fair matchpoint won.. 
BILAsst10: LOL - the X shows the strength|
pg| ***** 140 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: There wasn't a double in the auction we had.....     But there shoulda been :)
OK - enough on bidding.. I think in the actual auction E is good enough for 3@H even at these colors 
(of course, I could be wrong)
And S was too strong for 2@C - by about an Ace|

at|mitch:  Play: W might risk leading a diamond, looking for a couple of ruffs. 
On a diamond lead, the defense scores the @DA, a heart, a spade, and 2 diamond ruffs: to beat 3@C
@DAce, @D ruff, heart, @D ruff, and declarer cannot avoid losing spade later
BILAsst10: Thanks Mitch - rest your broken wrist:)
mitche: Well, thanks for coming to this evening's session. Thanks to Eileen for her generous assistance and play,
and to all of you for your courteous attention and questions.
