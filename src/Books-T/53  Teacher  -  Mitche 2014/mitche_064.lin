(If you're not sure about your settings log into your BBO windows version then:  
click the yellow tool at bottom and under the "general" tab check "widescreen" and save)
This will prevent the "cutting off" of the bottom parts or scrambling of your text in these presentations.

If you downloaded BBO recently, you will not be able to get online with the windows version...
You can still change or check your settings: 
Go to your C disc, and under "programs" find the Bridge Base Online folder
Open it and find the "profiles" folder
Open and scroll to find: BBO_Default_Settings 
line 71 should read: WIDE_CLIENT=1
If your setting is 0, change it to 1 and save.

fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."
Mitch Edelman aka mitche 



MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.
Thank you Eileen (wyoming33) for sending the hands and editing the chatlog! @h

at|mitche: Bidding:  Whether or not you open the North hand is a matter of style. I would prefer a club preempt 
(yes, even with 6) because the hand has no defensive tricks outside of clubs.  So pass or 3@c.

But 1@c should promise 2 quick tricks, and this hand has just 1.  Double of 1@c is pretty standard.
South, with the big club fit, (I guess the hand is worth about 12 -13 support points) should bid more strongly than 2@c, 
which she could bid without the @SA.  
My preferred bid is 2NT, the Jordan convention.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt|| 
at|mitche:  If you don't know or use it, a redouble would show strength (10+).
BILAsst10: If playing inverted minors? 
mitche:   Inverted minors are "off" over doubles. Except   1@c - 3@c  is preemptive.
BILAsst10: Because you can use Jordan?  
jkk9175: I thought Jordan was only over a Major opening?  
mitche:  Well, because you want to allow responder to raise clubs to 2 with something like  xx, xx, Qxxxx, Kxxx.
So Inverted Minors are off over X   (or any bid at all, for that matter) |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  West bids 2@s when she had to bid. 
At IMPS -- where small differences in scoring are not penalized as they are in match points 
-- I might bid 2@d with the West hand instead of 2@s.

at|mitche:  Play:  After the spade lead, declarer is pretty much assured of making the contract, 
with 3 hearts and one @D loser.
I think that East might lead the @DA (if you lead A from AK) or K (if you don't) in preference to the blind spade lead.
Although it doesn't matter here
(Declarer will finesse against the @SK because if West has that card, the contract is going down)|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt||at|Note that 3@s will make or go down 1 (depending on how well E/W guess to play spades).  
So there is something to be said for East raising spades to 3, after the 3@c bid. 
With a hand worth about 18 dummy points, I would do so.
Rabbit2W:  Would vulnerability change this opinion? 
Mitche:  Well, at IMPS, I would give up. At matchpoints, NV, I would bid.  
I would need to flip a coin before deciding to pass if vulnerable. |

BILAsst10:  What else could it be?
mitche:  Some play it as a mini-splinter, and some play it as looking for 3NT.      

In any event E/W decided it was a preemptive jump shift.
But the real bidding question for me - why not open East's hand with 1NT?|

Bergen uses 14+ - 17.

at|mitche:  Play:  What could the @C10 be as an opening lead?
If it's top of a doubleton, then West has 2 clubs. 
If it's a singleton, then West has 3 clubs. 
And if it's from @c10xx, then North would need to read a book on standard leads.

So, it's either a singleton or doubleton, and in either case, South can afford to play the @cQ at trick 1, 
followed by the Ace, and a third club for the defense.|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  West does best to ruff the third club with the @HQ.  If North can overruff, then that's too bad. 
Of course, I am assuming that West had doubleton club. 
With 3 of them, then the declarer must follow and North gets to ruff small.|
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


nt||at|One last point on play for the defense: 
Note that at trick 2, North led the @D6. 
I am not a fan of MUD  (Middle Up Down) 
Better to lead small from the  10 6 4    and then later on, discard the @D10
That way, North communicates her tripleton and can ruff a diamond.

nt||sk|w|mb|p|lb|*YWould you consider East's 3@H bid forcing?^^y|
mb|p|at|mitche:  It is about universal that a new suit bid after partner preempts (and you are an unpassed hand)

pg| ***** 53 ***** |

|sk||
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


at|mitche: Bidding:  
In second seat, and ESPECIALLY vulnerable, a preempt should be "sound", i.e. adhering to the rule of 2 and 3. 
If you aren't familiar with that, it says you should never offer more than 500 points to the opponents with your preempt.|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


at| 
With equal vulnerability, you can afford to go down   2 vulnerable,    3 nonvulnerable, 
and when preempting with unfavorable vulnerability, you need a pretty good hand. 
West's hand is not an opening preempt of 3@C in any form of scoring, at any vulnerability, not in second seat, anyway. |
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  You can define a hand as "semibalanced", 
where you have 1 long suit and the other 3 suits are as evenly divided as possible, 
so 6-3-2-2 and 7-2-2-2 are semibalanced.
If you hold either of those shapes, you should be very careful and have close to maximum values when you preempt.
|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


nt||at|Now, East has a problem over 3@c - her hand is, after all, pretty decent.
East bids 3@h  which would be my choice, too.
It is about universal that a new suit bid after partner preempts (and you are an unpassed hand) is 100% forcing.
So it doesn't matter if you preempted with the cheesiest hand outside of outer space.
Responder could have game in hand and does not need to jump to get the opening preemptor to continue bidding.|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


nt||at|Here, East just about has game in hand -- a 4-loser hand -- and with the opening preempt, the @CQ looks useful. 
So 3@h is the right bid, expecting some bid from partner.

at|mitche: Play:  I think it might be best to lead the Queen from this club holding, followed by the @CA and @CK. How should North signal when the @CK is led? 
It's usual to signal attitude, followed by present count, 
so the order should be 4, followed by 7, which shows no help in clubs -- followed by the lowest from her 3 remaining clubs. 
South shifted to @H's and the defense took its 4 tricks early. |
pg| ***** 95 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Declarer did well to ruff her third @D high and just cross-ruff to make the contract.  Also well played.
If she ruffs low, there is a risk of an overruff and a trump return, killing the crossruff.

Now, let's look at the opening 1@s bid. 
If you use Bergen's rule of 20, the North hand is a bit too thin for an opening bid. 
I would be more inclined to pass, 
since North has spades, she will always be able to get the suit in at the same level as the opps.

nt||
at|mitche:  Now, East's overcall of 2@d.   I would prefer a double to 2@d and 
- if pard bids clubs, then I'd bid 2@d 
- if pard bids 3@c, well, I would still bid 2@D 
(but the tournament director would make me bid 3, the  bum... )|
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


nt||at|jpadams52: Why would you prefer the double?  Just so I understand. 
mitche:  This treatment is known as "equal level conversion" 
and it allows you to bid a sort-of 2-suited hand, especially one with 4 of the unbid major and 5 diamonds. 
In standard bidding, a double of an opening bid followed by bidding your own suit shows a big hand.
But the number of times you hold 16 or 17 points and your RHO opens the bidding - well, that's not very common.
So we have seen takeout doubles evolve to show 2- or 3- suited hands.|
pg| ***** 105 ***** |


nt||at|This is called "equal level conversion doubles" 
and you always promise the unbid major and diamonds when you do it. 
You would NOT double with clubs and hearts.
So 1@S, double, pass, 2@C / pass 2@d shows hearts and diamonds, and probably diamonds are longer than hearts, 
else you would probably overcall hearts if you have 5 hearts and just 4@D's.|
pg| ***** 106 ***** |


nt||at|This is very common in tournament play and not 100% standard, so if you decide to use ELCD, you 
a) must discuss with partner to avoid a costly bidding misunderstanding and 
b)  discuss with partner again, just to make sure. 

As far as I know, equal level conversions are not alertable.|
pg| ***** 107 ***** |


nt||at|Liz111:  So always, a double of a Major opening would be an ELCD? - can never be a regular t/o double?
mitche:  If you agree to equal level conversion doubles, 
a double may be your regular, conventional "I have the other 3 suits" double 
OR  "I have the other major and diamonds"|
pg| ***** 108 ***** |


at|
You find out ONLY if the auction goes like this: 1@S (or 1@H) double, pass, 2@C
Now, if it's a standard double, the doubler passes (or raises, if his hand's good enough)|
pg| ***** 109 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  If the doubler bids 2@d, 
then it shows 4 hearts, and probably 5 diamonds and still minimum (13-16+ HCP)
jpadams52:  Do have to list it in your CC's?
mitche:  yes

at|mitche: Play:  I would prefer that South lead the @SJ to the 6. 
With this holding, you do not want to mislead partner about the location of the J and 10.. 
When declarer finessed the trump at trick 4 into North, it isn't easy to see that the best return is another diamond.
Here is how North can reason it out:|
pg| ***** 128 ***** |

If South has a singleton club, he might have led it.

pg| ***** 129 ***** |


nt||at|And as it turns out, it also kills the contract.
The same reasoning tells North that it must also be correct to duck the @cQ and @CJ, 
so that the suit cannot be set up.

at|mitche:  Bidding:  What does North show for her 2@s raise?
arya_01:  4 card support 
Mitche:  What should North have in high-card strength for 2@s?
Think this out: who opened the bidding?
South did, and North bid 1@H (which is unlimited.. could be 19 points!).
When South bid 1@s, his hand's limited to about 16 points, maybe a bad 17.
So 2@s is a minimum raise by North, showing a hand with about 9 losers and a maximum of about 10 points, a bad 10 at that.|
pg| ***** 137 ***** |


nt||
at|Now, South has how many losers? 
BILAsst10:  6
mitche:  Yep, 6 losers opposite a bid that shows 9 losers.
That means the N/S pair has 15 losers between them, 
which means their probable maximum is just 9 tricks (24 less 15).  
So South should not bid over 2@s.    Are we agreed to that??|
pg| ***** 138 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Now, should North have bid just 2 spades?  How many losers does North have?
jkk9175: 8
BILAsst10: 8 1/2
mitche:  yes, with 8 losers, North should bid what?
jkk9175: 3
BILAsst10: 3
mitche:  well, it's a soft 8 - call it 8 1/2 because of the unsupported queens|
pg| ***** 139 ***** |


nt||
at|BILAsst10: right - so maybe 2 is enough and lousy distribution -
mitche:  With this particularly flat hand and unsupported queens, (two negative aspects), 2@S might be right, 
but it would not be out of the question to invite with 3@s.
If North does bid 3@s, south, with a decent hand and what might be a useful filler in hearts, should then bid 4. 
But South should not even sniff at game after a 2@s bid|
pg| ***** 140 ***** |


nt||at|If you don't have my losing trick handout, please email me and put BIL LTC in the subject line 
- I will mail you a summary of the losing trick count in MS Word format. 
(Can google Loosing Trick Count for several links.)
If North decides to bid game over 3@d, 3NT might be right, but I would still go to 4@s, 
since pard expects to play in spades, and my hand really doesn't have a lot of strength in the  minors; 
remember that flat hands need a lot of strength to take 9 tricks in NT.
So N/S on their actual auction should wind up in spades, not NT, and probably after 3@D, at 4 spades.

at|mitche: Play:  In 3NT, I wouldn't lead a club. 
A) North promises strength in that suit and  
B) I would let declarer figure out the suits on his own and lead the most passive lead I can - a spade
This was not an auction that promised a lot of extra strength, so declarer will need to do some work.  
I do not want to help her.
BTW, declarer should not take a spade finesse but rather play off the @SA at trick 2, hoping for 3-2 spades.|

nt||
at|mitche:  When the Jack falls and declarer gets the news about spades, she can still score 4 spades, 2 hearts, 
2 clubs (even if the defense doesn't lead them) and 1 diamond.

Thanks to Eileen for her generous assistance and to all of you for your courteous attention and participation.

MM: You can play the hand Double Dummy if you wish
