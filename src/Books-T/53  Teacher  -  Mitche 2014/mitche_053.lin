^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, 
if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. 
We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. 
My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, 
so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving 
and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|^b@2mitche:    ^*BOverview of 2/1^*N


In response to a request, I will do a very quick (50,000 foot) overview of what we mean by 2 over 1 bidding
-- for most of you this should be review, but it is useful to review and reinforce what we already know.

We are going to set these constraints on what a "2 over 1 GF auction" is: 
Opener starts in first or second seat with a bid of 1@D, 1@H, or 1@S, RHO passes,
AND Responder makes a NON-JUMP response at the 2 level.

So there are just 6 possible starts to a 2 over 1 GF auction: 
1@S followed by 2@C, 2@D, 2@H
1@H followed by 2@C, 2@D, and 
1@D with a 2@C response.

So, if partner opens 1@S in first seat and you have this hand: 
@sxx   @hAJ10xx   @dKQx   @cKxx    your hand is strong enough to bid 2@H over 1@S.

But @sxx   @hAJ10xx   @dKQx   @cJxx is not good enough. 
That is a MAJOR difference between SA and 2/1

You would NOT want to force to game with 10 points opposite 12, I think, 
so you may not bid 2@H if you are playing 2/1.

This means that there are lots of times when you will be unable to bid at the 2 level.
You use the FORCING 1NT response to keep the auction alive.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


nt||cp|2|
at|^b@2
mitche:
Example 2 (@sxx   @hAJ10xx   @dKQx   @cJxx) would NOT bid 2@H over 1@S, but rather, the bid is 1NT (F)
Opener MUST NOT PASS 1NT if he opened 1@H or 1@S.

But (sidebar) the auction 1@D – 1NT is not forcing, and responder has a hand without a 4-card Major and
(it depends on your agreements) a range of 6/7 - 9/11 HCP.

I use a weaker and broader range of 6-10 as range the for 1NT in the auctions 1@C - 1NT and 1@D - 1NT.
This sometimes gets us 1 level too high, but it makes things much easier for bidding games.

Remember the definition of 2 over 1.. 
1@D - 2@C is Game Forcing, so you need your 1NT response to be rather wider than in SA.

That is the brief overview.  
2/1 is built on frequent use of the forcing 1NT and game forcing 2 over 1 by an unpassed responder.


OK, let's play some bridge!

at|mitche: Bidding:   East's 2@D was a Michaels Cue bid.  If you bid 2@D over 1@D (or 2@C over 1@C), it shows 5-5
in the Majors.  You need to decide on the strength.   
This hand may well have been in the range where it might have been better to bid your suits
WestElsdon:  Do you have a range that you use?
mitche:  I use good-bad Michaels, where the bid is either really ratty (5 -10) or good (15+) HCP.  
So pard knows whether we have game going hand or not.  But that is a lesson for later.  
I will someday do a  lesson on Michaels. It's an important convention to know and use well.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


sk|s|nt||
at|mitche:  Anyway - East showed the majors.  S doubled, 
(I might bid 3@D to take away some bidding room from West.   
She may have decided to pass 3@D).  

Also, S isn't sure she wants a @D led against a Major-suit contract.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


sk|w|at|
West's 2@S bid is about right, I think.  
And East's hand is a minimum strength hand for raising to 3@S freely.
So the auction was mostly what I would expect.

at|mitche: Play: If I were North, I would give some thought to a trump lead. Why?  East is known to have a
distributional hand, and West liked spades enough to bid over the double.  So West is likely to plan to
cross-ruff.  On the lead of the @CQ, West should play as follows:|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


at|
Win the club, cash a diamond, and the @HA from dummy, return to hand with a club, and start cross-ruffing.
She would score at  least 10 tricks that way.  If the defense can lead trumps 3 times (as declarer allowed
them to do), declarer would score only 7 or 8 tricks, depending on when the defense shifts to trumps.|

at|mitche: Bidding: After S bids 2@D, what should N do? If you look at the cards, 3NT is a very good contract
(declarer ducks a club and has 5 clubs, a heart, 2 spades, and 4 diamonds, if she can score  them all).
But the defense has 3 winners, so declarer will win just 10 tricks, maybe 9,  if she ducks a club to East.
Anyway, how do they get there?|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


at|
N can bid 2@H over 2@D to say "I have an opening hand" and "I have heart cards".  S has an easy 2NT rebid,
and N carries on to 3NT.|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Here is the principle: N bid her suit freely after the overcall;  then, after opener's rebid,
N's 2@H bid says "I have hearts under control."  
Or at least under control enough to think about NT.
If N had bid 2@S over 2@D, I would assume that it is NOT a spade suit, but rather, a spade stopper.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt||at|no skill 2: A bid at 2 level is 2/1, only if rho passes?
mitche:  The 2@C bid is Standard, not 2 over 1.  
A 2-level bid by responder after second seat overcalls (as happened here) shows a minimum of 10-11 points.  
And yes, 2@C would be 2 over 1 GF only if the auction was 1@D - pass - 2@C.

at|mitche: Play: West decided to lead the unbid suit, which turned out not to hurt.  
Declarer led to the @D9, ducked by West,  and then cashed a couple of clubs, I think, with the idea of 
setting the suit up for discards.  If I were declarer, I would think that the spade finesse is a bad idea. 
Why?
If East had the @SK, he would have played it at trick 1.   Leading the unbid suit when you have not got
a good lead in a different suit is very common practice.  |
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Now, one last point: when W got in and led the 13th spade,  East ruffed it.  Which he should not do.
(you need to count the cards, everyone) - 
had East just discarded his last club, it would save a trick for the defense.
OK?  We all count - now count the cards, too :)

at|mitche: Bidding: Someone asked if there is a Michaels bid over a weak 2 - 
Most people I know play it over all 1 bids and weak 2@D,  also.   
As with any bid, you need to discuss with partner when it is and when it isn't in force.  
Anyway, the standard convention card doesn't specify a range for Michaels.
You need to take it up with pard.|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


nt||at|
Basic common sense tells you that the higher the level and whether you're vulnerable,  the stronger your 
hand needs to be.  
In my expert partnership, I double with 5-5 in the majors (and play something called "equal level conversions").|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  We use the immediate 3@D bid over 2@D as an ask for a stopper for NT.  
I am sure that is not a standard agreement.
North's 4@D bid might talk some East hands into a double, but 5@D is sure to keep them out of the bidding.   
And here, it's cheap insurance against 4@H  (and best defense beats 5@H - will get to that momentarily).|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |

Anyway - when E bids 4@H, S has nothing else to say 
(Rule.. when you preempt, you must not bid again unless partner asks you to).

How many of you as declarers know "high card from short side" to prevent blocking suits?  
Look at the club suit. 
Declarer cashes the @CAK before playing to queen!!|
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


nt||at|Well, the same thing applies to defense. 
When declarer won the @DK, N was in possession of the @DQ10 and she played the 10.  
If Declarer had played on hearts instead of spades, South would have been forced to win the @HA 
while N had that @DQ.|
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  And the diamond suit, instead of producing 3 defensive tricks, would have gotten the
defenders just 1 of them.  
It is MUCH harder for defenders to unblock, because defenders are trained to hold onto winners 
(and they see only one hand).

Even at this vulnerability, I am good enough to balance with a double.  Especially at matchpoints,
where if 2@H is making, and I am making 2@S or 3 of a minor.

at|mitch:  Play:  OK, contract was 2@H and N led the @C10 -  the best lead.  
When the @CK won the first trick, North, where is the club Ace located?|

You knew this because declarer would have happily won it and 2 club tricks.  
Also, from last hand, we remember that stuff about lowest of equals on defense :)|

So, when N won the @SA, she should not play diamonds, but rather, she continues clubs.  
The defense now wins 3 clubs and 3 aces to set  2@H
Also, when declarer ducked the @DJ in dummy, S did well not to win the @DA.  
That limits declarer to just 1 trick in diamonds. Good play, gypsy|

at|mitche: Bidding: After 1@C, S should overcall 1@S.
You don't need an opening hand to overcall, just a good suit.  
And the outside @CK - behind the 1@C opener - is probably a winner, too.  
Also, when the gods of the deal give you the spade suit, use it for its preemptive value.|

nt||at|Note that W would not have enough to bid 2@H, but rather she would almost surely pass,  
and north, with her very good hand, would have something to say.  
After 1@C-1@H, North is kind of fixed.  She has a big hand but no way to get into the auction.
So 2@C became the final contract by default, almost.  That is another reason to bid 1@S initially.

up|52|pf|y|at|mitch:  Play:  S led the @D8 (I lead small from xxx here,  so pard doesn't think I have a doubleton).  
And N won the @DA, then the @DK and then a shift.  That sequence shows doubleton @dAK specifically! 
N should win the @DK, lowest of equals --- again-- and then plays her singleton spade at trick 2.|
pg| ***** 132 ***** |


nt||at|Declarer is now cooked.   
The defense will score the @SAQ and a spade ruff, the @DAK, the @HA, and the @CK to set 2@C at least 2 tricks 
(those diamonds aren't going anywhere). |

fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|^b@2

There were some  key points covered for tonight: 
First -  The defensive principle of lowest from equals on defense occured several times. It's really essential
to learn this, because it is imperative for defenders to  communicate effectively -- this helps you place honor
card and spot card sequences.
So please... learn it! And use it!|

Second, we had some interesting Michaels Cue bid sequences.  We discussed 1@C -2@C showing the Majors.  
What does it mean when the auction is 1@H (2@H overcall)?  Michaels – A cue bid over a Major, shows the
other Major and an undisclosed minor.  If advancer (4th hand) wants to know which minor the Michaels bidder
has, what does she do?
In other words, the auction is 1@H – 2@H (Michaels) - pass - ??? |
pg| ***** 136 ***** |

The bid is 2NT -  says "pard, please bid your minor".  You give up the natural 2NT bid but it's really
uncommon for you to have a natural 2NT bid in that auction, so you aren't giving much up.. 
Pattipat:  So overcaller must have a stronger Michaels bid?
mitche:  Not necessarily.. If opps were vul and I had @sx, @hKJ9xx, @dx, @cQ109xxx, I would overcall
1@S with 2@S, expecting to save against a possible 4@S contract.
Mike Lawrence, one of the all time greats, teaches that the most important thing is shape, not high
card strength. 
Imagine that over 2@S advancer has @sxxx, @hQ10xx,@d xxxx,@c xx.
5@H is down 3, less than 4@S making, and in fact, aggressive bidding may keep them out of their ice-cold 7@S.

Thanks to Eileen for her generous assistance and to all of you for your courteous attention and participation.

MM: This concludes this presentation, we hope you enjoyed, Karen10 & GG_Bridge|
