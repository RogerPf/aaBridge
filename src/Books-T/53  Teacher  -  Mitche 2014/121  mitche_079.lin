fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department).  Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue 
(who loves puttering with the plants in the back yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.  Mitch is also an avid 
amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.  Mitch is currently an active bridge player, and joined the BIL's Mentoring Team 
February 24, 2010.  His "Play and Discuss 2/1" sessions are most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player.

"When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."
Mitch Edelman aka mitche 


MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.
Thank you Eileen (wyoming33) for sending the hands and editing the chatlog! @h

pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|mitche: Bidding:   West has a pretty good hand, and after the @h-fit has been discovered, 
she might think about more than game by bidding 3@c, a "control" bid.
East might get very interested and bid 3@d; since @H are agreed on, there is no ambiguity. 
This shows a high diamond card (A or K).
E/W will very likely then get into a Blackwood auction, discover they are off an ace and the trump queen, 
and stop at 5.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Should West bid 3@c?
It is close.   With 6 losers, she needs more than a minimum hand from East. 
The issue is that with 6 losers, she needs a 6 loser hand from opener.
With that much strength, East would not have made a simple 2@h bid!!|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Even though West has a very good hand, 
East would have found something stronger than 2@h if she had a 6-loser hand.
So the bidding we saw is right.
Think in terms of losers. An opening bid of 1 in a suit = how many losers???
tapanzee:  7
mitche:  Good.  It could also be 6 losers, or even 5.  But with 6-loser hand, East might invite game.

at|mitche: Play: What should North lead against this auction? |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


at|
Let's begin by looking at what North should NOT lead.
- A spade or a heart is out. 
- A diamond is very risky and can blow a trick.
Better would be to lead the @C10, which may not set up anything for the defense, but neither will it cost anything.
Leading from 2 non-touching honors, e.g. KJ or Q10, especially when the other guys have bid strongly, 
will often blow a trick without getting anything back in return.  Look for a better lead elsewhere.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt||
AT|mitche:  Sometimes you will have a clue that it's OK to lead from a broken sequence, 
like when the other guys bid 3 suits (like they want to bid NT) but settle for someone's second bid suit. 
Then the lead from KJ rates to be better. 
Should declarer take the first round finesse? |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


at|
Well, let's see. She is planning to use the long club to discard the losing @d, but then she has spades to lose. 
Declarer has how many losers? |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


at|
Her hand has 1 trump loser, 2 diamonds, 2 clubs, and  2 or 3 spades. |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Dummy will cover 4 losers and she can ruff a spade (maybe 2) in dummy.  
So the contract is safe. Yes?
I think it is correct to finesse in diamonds at trick 1, because then the clubs can be used to cover a spade loser 
(3 rounds of trumps will leave declarer with just 1 trump in dummy  and 3 spade losers in hand).
veeree:  We can discard diamond on club so why take risk.
mitche:  Because then you have spades to lose.
If North wins the @SA and gets out with another spade, instead of the @DK you are held to 11 tricks.|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt|| 
at|veeree:  She took 12.
mitche:  She was not entitled to take 12 tricks!  Go back to the 10th trick, where North played the @DK.
Let's suppose that the defense gets out with the @SJ (rather than the @DK) then declarer loses a spade .. 
the @DQ is not a winner.

MM: By clicking on the cards, you can play the hand Double Dummy.

lb|*mWhat factors might lead South to pass the 1@c bid?^Partnership agreement~Playing for IMPS~Bidding Style~All those reasons^4|
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|sk||
at|mitche: Bidding:  This is one of those hands where you have to have some discussion of bidding style.
First... does South have enough stuff to bid over 1@c?
CarlieG:  No but I could not leave her in clubs.
mitche:  With a bad 5 count, some pairs would decide it's best to pass.
Others would believe (as Carlie just said) that she can't sit for 1@c.
The fact is that if South passes 1@C, about 80% of the time, West will balance.
And when West doesn´t pass, partner has a club stack.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  The risk is not that you play 1@c, but that opener bids something like 3NT or 2@h over 1@s.
...So it's a matter of style and agreement whether South should bid. 
Or, if my style is to bid up the line instead of walsh style, I would bid 1@d. 
So you need to know your style and agreements to know what is best with south hand.
At IMPS I pass.  At matchpoints, I bid 1@s.
GG_Bridge:  I'm not seeing the difference for the 2 types of games .. why does that matter? |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  At IMPS, we may have better contracts than 1@c, 
but bidding over 1@c may lead us to a much worse contract (imagine that North rebids 3@c). 
So I am willing to give up on improving the contract.
At matchpoints, I want to bid 1@s as a preemptive bid.  
Maybe it will shut out a 1-level overcall by West and allow me to steal the board 
.. at matchpoints, I am really, really aggressive.  
But that is my style.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


nt||at|Some people will pass that hand no matter what the scoring!
Let's move back to North and ask what she should bid over 1@s.
Her hand is worth 19 HCP and 2NT is reasonable.. but it has a defect.. namely the heart suit.
If you and partner are on the same wavelength, North might be able to get away with 2@d, a reverse.
But you have to have a partner with a good sense of humor (or a good imagination)
2NT is right on value, but 2@d (yes, I KNOW it's a 3-card suit) might be a better bid, 
as long as partner knows you have more clubs than diamonds.|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


nt||at|Here, if North found the inspired 2@d bid, N/S will wind up playing in 4 or 5 diamonds 
(5@d makes because the clubs are friendly).
So North is likely to bid 2NT and that just makes...|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


at| 
Here are this deal's key points:|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt||at|
1) You need to know if responder passes, bids 1@d or 1@s. Those are all matters for partnership discussion.
2) You need to know if 2NT rebid by opener promises a hand like this. I think it should not.
I think that you should treat a reverse into 2@d as looking for 3NT, not for a minor-suit game.
GG_Bridge: Can you recommend the bidding sequence?
mitche:  My regular partnership (not the precision one) bids 1@C – p.

SK||

at|mitche: Bidding: After 2@c, North has a bit of a problem: she would like to bid 2@h, but that is 4th suit forcing.
2NT would show about 10 points.
2@s should show 6 or a very good 5. I think 2@s is biddable here.
I would not raise 2@c with just 3 card support.
2NT by South is a bit of an underbid, but it is less an underbid than 3NT is an overbid.|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  The alternative to 2NT is to pass 2@s, and that would be a popular, if not unpleasant choice.

If South passes, 2@s will take 8 tricks, or maybe 9, 
depending on how declarer handles trumps and the opening lead.

sk||

at|mitche: Bidding:  Note that South doesn't need North to have the @SA to make a slam 
- put the @CK in the North hand and 6@h is a very good contract.
So how should the bidding go?
a) North should not bid 2@h, but rather she should "super-accept" by bidding 3@h to show 4 card support 
and a minimum NT overcall.
If you do not know about super acceptance, please see Marty Bergen's booklets on it. 
(MM: note: There are many ways to superaccept, they therefor need partnership agreement)|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


nt||
at|b) It is a bad idea to use blackwood with a void (unless you use "exclusion blackwood" ) 
which asks for the number of aces outside the "exclusion suit". 
|cp|4|at|MM: Info link (click)    ^*Hwww.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/exclusion_keycard_blackwood.html^*n |cp||at|
Better sequence here: after 1@s opener: 
1NT overcall - 2@d / 3@h (4-card support) - 3@s (@s-control) / 4@D (@d-control) - 5@c (@s AND @c-control) / 6@H.
In any event, do not use blackwood with a void.  Better to cue bid.

Well, how many losers in declarer's hand?  She has 3 spades and 2 clubs.
What can she do about them? |
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


at|
She can ruff 3 spades in dummy. 
And when trumps divide 2-1, she could play just 2 rounds of trumps to finish off the trumps.
That still leaves 2 club losers. |
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  One of them can go away by discarding a small club on the @SA.
Then declarer can ruff her last small club after giving one up
So the play should be.. win @CA at trick 1 - draw trumps at tricks 2 and 3; then @SA (discard club) 
and concede a club.
Now, the defense will return a black card. Ruff in dummy, diamond to K, ruff a black card in dummy, 
@DA, and cross-ruff.
The point here -- plan the play before starting.|

The rule of 15 (for opening 4th seat) says: Add the number of HCP and the number of spades you have, 
this total should be at least 15 for you to open in 4th seat.
The reasoning is: the points are likely divided 20-20 or 21-19 or maybe 22-18.|

at|mitche:  So the side with spades will be able to outbid the other guys at the 1 or 2 level, and to do so in safety.  
If 4th seat doesn't have spades, it is better in the long run to pass out the deal.
So West bid 1@d.
And East bid 1@S, West - 1NT. 
East now bid 2@s .. I think that a better bid might be 2@c - New minor Forcing. 
Find out if West has 3 spades.
If West bids 2@d then East might pass.|
pg| ***** 99 ***** |


nt||
at|BILAsst10: Over 2@C would West bid 2@H?
mitche:  I think It's better to rebid 2@d (show the 5 card suit). 
If East has 4 hearts, she would have bid 2@h instead of 2@c.
1@d - 1@S/ 1NT - 2@h shows 5 spades and 4 hearts.
(MM: Playing NMF: 1@d - 1@S/ 1NT - 2@h shows 5 spades and 4 hearts, but is NF!
To make the forcing auction, you would go through NMF...ask for 3-card @s or 4-card @h..
Opener holding neither answers 2NT after NMF...unless you made other agreements with P...)

at|mitche: Play:  After the heart lead, North wins the @HK and should cash the @DA.
Why?
The @h opening lead cannot possibly be a singleton. Why? 
If it were a singleton, then East would have to have 4 hearts. (right? we just had that discussion).
So leading a heart into the AJ10 cannot possibly work for the defense.
And after cashing the @DA, a shift to clubs is right.
Now, South will NOT lead a diamond for a ruff (why?).|
pg| ***** 115 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  South can work out that the @DQ is a winner. 
When North cashes the @DA and doesn't continue the suit, she can reason that the @DA was singleton.
Which means that the @DQ will win a trick on its own eventually.
So South knows that diamonds cannot be right.
She can lead another heart.
Declarer will now lose 2 or 3 trumps, the @CA, the heart, and 2 diamonds, down 1.|

at|mitche: Bidding:  What should North do after 1@s?
I think that we agree North is too weak to bid 2@h.
But North should probably make a bid of some sort, possibly 1NT or a negative X, depending on how chippy she feels.
I would bid 1NT.
BILAsst10: Shouldn't 1NT show at least 8 HCP?
mitche:  7.  I am going to lie by a point based on the @H suit.|
pg| ***** 121 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  It might be a cruddy bid, but I kind of like the North hand with an ace and a 5 card suit.
So sue me, but I am taking full advantage of everything there is to take advantage of, vulnerability, the @S9 
and I would not be all that upset if North passed, either.
Again, I am very aggressive competing for part scores.
But passing isn't awful either.
East bid 1NT (OK)
I would bid 2@c with South hand over 1NT. |
pg| ***** 122 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  The hand has a lot of pluses - aces and kings, instead of quacks, and the @C suit has some intermediates, too.
Whether South bids 2@C or passes, West should bid 2@d.
The 6-5 shape is too wild to pass 1NT.
And I am going to rebid 3@D over anything but 2@s.
 |
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:If East raises 2@d to 3@d, as East is a passed hand, West should be reluctant to bid more.  
East would need 2 Aces and either the @DK or a working finesse for 5@d to make, much too much for a passed East. 
So 3@d should be the final contract.
The defense will win its 3 Aces and that will be that.

at|mitche: Play:   South led the @C7 
North should win the @cAce and return a club.
If the defense begins that way, East should play the @CJ at round 2.
If South wins and continues the suit, then East has 2 club stoppers and can play on diamonds. 
That gives her 5 diamonds and 2 clubs.
No other defense will work to defeat 1NT, either.|
pg| ***** 139 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  If North wins the @CA and shifts to a heart at trick 2, declarer will duck a heart trick, 
and N/S can set up, but not cash the @H suit.
So 1NT is always making.

So let's summarize the lessons from tonite.|
pg| ***** 140 ***** |


nt||
at|a) The bidding gives you an idea of what the opponents have.  
Equally as important as what they did bid is what they did NOT (hand 5, I think, with heart suit).
b) Plan the play: - count losers (at trump contracts) and winners (at NT) and decide how many tricks you need to develop.
You and your regular partner need to discuss bidding style (think about the weak hand after 1@C opening).|
pg| ***** 141 ***** |
