fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, 
if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. 
We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. 
My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, 
so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving 
and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."


Mitch Edelman aka   "mitche"






MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.
Thank you Eileen (wyoming33) for sending the hands and editing the chatlog! @h

pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|mitche: Bidding:   The first thing we need to do is distinguish between a natural and an unusual NT bid.
In this case, as this auction developed, I would treat 2NT as natural, and not the minors. 
Why?|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at| 
There are 2 reasons:
First, the bid was non-jump.
Second, 4th hand (West) is marked with some points. |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||
At|mitch:  East should have a 10-11 point balanced hand with a spade stop for her bid.  
At least that is what I would expect,  and if that is what East should hold, West should bid 3NT. 
That is what I would think is the majority treatment of a balancing 2NT after a weak 2 bid.

A Direct 2NT bid over 2@S should show about 15 -17/18 points and spades well –protected.
Now how would you show the minors after a weak 2?
You wouldn’t.  Too bad. Can't get there from here.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt|| 
At|mitche:  Should West have bid over 2@S? |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


at|
West should pass, and wait for East to do something.
He cannot bid a 4-card suit at the 3-level opposite a passing partner, and he isn’t strong enough for 2NT.
If E/W use equal level conversions at the 3-level (a very uncommon treatment), then maybe West could double. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||
at||cp|4|at|Info says experts use this conventional takeout double (ELCD) 
to look for the other major when ops open a major and bidder has the other major and diamonds 
- if pard responds clubs to the double, bidder can correct to diamonds 
Not showing a big hand. (= not showing a "double and correct" promising good 17+)|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt||cp||
at|mitche:  But best is to wait for East to reopen the bidding, hopefully with a double.
Then West can bid 3 or 4 hearts, depending on how brave he feels. 
(I am a coward and would bid just 3).

Do you agree with North’s pass over 3@D?
It is very close, and I would not fault a 3@S  bid, nor would I fault passing, especially at IMPS.|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


nt||

at|mitche:  I expect to defeat 3@D at least 1/2 the time with North hand (2 aces, a spade, and 1 or 2 trump tricks).
I think that on balance it's better for North to pass, 
because his hand has an unappealing distribution and no spade picture.

Just something to remember -- If you are bidding to the 3 level when the opponents have the balance of  strength, 
you need some good distribution or else you will get your head handed to you.

at|mitche: Play:  Now - when South won the spade at trick 1, she shifted to a club. 
I don't agree with that. 
Better is to play a @h, hoping to pin an unsupported heart honor in the West hand and maybe to get a ruff.
The clubs look like dummy's best asset.  Don't help set up declarer's side suit.

at|mitche: Play:  If West wants to lead diamonds, the suit bid on his left, 
he would do best to lead the @DQ from @DQJ9, rather than the 4th best 7. 
South may have thought the 7 was singleton, because she did not take the Spade finesse.

However, even if the diamond was a singleton, there is no reason not to take the finesse. |
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: If it loses and a ruff happens, then declarer can discard a losing heart or club on the @DK.
So the finesse costs nothing, even if it loses. (unless it loses to singleton K)|

(MM: But what are the chances? 4 cards out split 3-1 or 1-3  49.8% of the time,

SK||

at|mitche: Bidding:  West wonders what to do over 3@S.  Let's help figure this out.
How many (or how few) points should East have to make a negative X here?|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


at|
Around 8.
Does East have around 8?|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


at|
6 HCP and a singleton spade and all the points in long suits. 
Close enough for this level. |
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


nt||
At|mitche:  This would be a decent dummy most of the time at the 2 level.
But not at the 4 level!
So West should ask herself if her hand is worth a "raise" to 4@H...|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


at|
Not opposite an 8 point hand, vulnerable.  So pass is reasonable. 
Sometimes 4@H will make, but it seems against the odds. 
Another way to look at it is that E/W rate to have just 8 trumps between them.
So 4@H would need more than a minimum negative X. |
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


nt||
At|mitche:  I do not like the double of 3@S 
If North passes, and the alternative of pass is reasonable, then E/W are committed to the 4 level.
The bidding should have died at 3@S. 
North's 4@S bid with 6 losers opposite a preemptive raise is very aggressive, especially when not pushed there.

Pattipat: If they bid 4@H, should North go to 4@S?
mitche:  Yes.  With a 10+ card fit, you can't afford to sell out at favorable vul, especially, at IMPS.

at|mitch: Play: West knows from the negative X that East has 4 hearts, Right?
So declarer is marked with a singleton.
And when East played high-low in diamonds, West should count the suit and deduce that North began with 3 @d's. 
OK - the reason I mention this is that West can now avoid the poisoned heart continuation 
and play a third diamond to beat 4@S by a trick. |
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


nt||
At|mitche:  This is pretty important, folks. 
Your partner's signals (high low in diamonds) and bids (neg X promising 4 hearts) 
helps you count the hand

sk||

at|mitche: Bidding: Looking at West's hand, it's plain that she intended the double of 1@S to be takeout-oriented.
Problem is, it isn’t.  I am not sure what it is, but takeout, it is not. 
If you had a spade stack behind declarer, it's best to pass and await a reopening X, 
So, you may agree to define X as something, I guess, but it isn't standard bidding to treat it as takeout here.
Remember that East passed, so she is not robust, and West is on a sound minimum opener.  |
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


nt|| 
At|mitche:  So West should bid 2@C, if she feels like competing, but best is to pass.
After the X, things were a bit unusual.
North's 2NT was scrambling, I guess, bidding what her values suggested.
and 3@S and 3NT look like more scrambling.

sblitz: Would you pass 2NT with the South's hand?
mitche: No, I would bid 3@S -  and I suggest that as the final contract.|
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  North should reason that South heard the 2NT bid and thinks that the hand belongs in spades.
So South should have a decent 6-card suit.
You all know the old saw, "when you find yourself in a hole, stop digging!" 
This hand is an example of that, and the result was N/S reached a pretty silly contract.
Why is 3NT silly?
Well, they are entitled to 8 tricks - maybe just 7.

It works for both declarer and defender.
West's diamond lead (at trick 8) was made hoping for something good to happen in diamonds.

there was no way for E/W to win the 4 diamonds they were entitled to -- the suit now blocked. |

Marty Bergen has a saying, "He who knows, goes" - 
S knew that the hand belonged in game and 3NT seemed the best place - so he bid it.
a) South was strong enough to bid 1@D. 
(BUT some people will bid 1@H anyway, because of importance people place on finding Major suit fits.)
b) After no Major fit found, then 3NT is a logical conclusion to the auction.

I would have played a third round of clubs. East returned her original 4th best club, the 3, so once again, 
an inferential count was available to the defenders,

sblitz:  After the first two tricks, would you risk the contract and try for an overtrick in Spades
before taking your 9 tricks?
mitche:  No, I am not interested in overtricks in a cold contract at IMPS.

MM:  By clicking on the cards, you can play the hand Double Dummy, 
please click the  ^$40 for the next board |

at|mitche: Bidding:  After partner's pass and RHO opens, 2@H (weak jump overcall) is reasonably good idea.
There is no reasonable chance that E/W have game, and the bid takes up some bidding space.  
When East pushes the bidding to the 3 level, N/S have a bit of a problem.

Turns out N/S can beat 3@HX for 800, but they are also making 6@D. 
6@D is a poor contract (needs to find 2 cards, the @SK and the @DQ), not many people will be in that contract.  |

At|mitche:  So 3@H really puts N/S under the gun, but N/S should be in game.
There is the problem that even vulnerable and risking 800 puts on N/S.
I think that after 3@H, pass, pass, North may try 3@S. 
Since the neg X says "4 spades", South won’t be confused about N's hand.
And the logical interpretation of 3@S is "can you bid 3NT, pard?"
South won't like it, but he can either bid 4@D or risk 4@S 
(if South had spades as good as @sA10x, he might raise to 4@S anyway) |
pg| ***** 120 ***** |


nt||
At|mitche:  Here (after 3@s) south bids 4@D and North goes on to 5@d. 
Remember, the 3@S bid here is begging South to bid 3NT with a heart stopper.
If South had a minimum hand, then he would pass 3@s even with a heart stop.
Remember that the negative X promises only 8 points.
So North has to be the one to push to game.

up|24|pf|y|at|mitch: Play: One point on defense - East played the @H4 at trick 1, her highest spot. 
The idea here is to hope that West will realize East has a good heart card, 
in case it might be correct to continue hearts even with the void in dummy.|
