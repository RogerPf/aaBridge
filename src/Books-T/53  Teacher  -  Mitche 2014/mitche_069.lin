fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch and his his wife Sue live in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore, together with 3 (spoiled) rescue cats 
and aquarium.
Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.
Sue loves pottering with the plants in the backyard.

Mitch is also an active bridge player who learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament
bridge for graduate school, career and marriage.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player.

mitche:
"When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

Mitch Edelman aka  "mitche" 



MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.

fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|^b@2mitche:   ^*bBidding After Opener's Reverse^*N
We are going to start with a discussion of reverses and bidding after Opener reverses. 
First, we need to make sure that we agree on what a reverse is.

A reverse is a non-jump rebid by opener, in a higher ranking suit than his first bid suit, and below 2 of responder's suit.
When the bid is made after a 1 over 1 response, the reverse shows extra values. 
Examples of reverse auctions: 
1@c – 1@s/ 2@d     or     1@h – 1NT/2@s. 
Opener's first suit is always longer than the second bid suit - at least 5-4 in shape (*)|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at| 
But note: 1@c – 1@h / 2@s is not a reverse, it is a ^*b"jump-shift"^*n and is forcing to game 
- because 2@s is ^*uabove^*n 2@h, responder's suit.
 
(*Expert note:  Sometimes you may reverse to establish a force and describe your hand pattern. 
Example: @sKQx, @hx, @dAKJ, @cAK10xxx  
After 1@C – 1@S by responder, it would be foolish to stop short of game. So opener bids 2@d (forcing, 1 round), 
and over any rebid by responder, raises to 3@S. 
Responder will know opener has 3 good spades and a singleton heart and bid game on a hand like 
@sJ10xxx  @hKxxx  @dxx  @cxx  
With decent spades and working cards in the minors, (ex: @sAJxxx, @hxxxx, @dxx, @cQx) 
an expert pair might even reach 6@s)|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at|

A reverse is forcing for 1 round.
Some players like to say they are game-forcing, but I think they are best played as forcing for 1 round, 
showing 5 or 6 losers (16+ points with good suits).  
Example hand for a reverse: 
@s 7 @h KQJ6 @d AQJ83, @c K54.  You open 1@d, and over 1@s, you bid 2@h to show a 6-loser hand 
with 4 hearts and more diamonds.
|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
Responder may have kept the bidding open on a very poor hand (with 10 losers)..... so you need to have a way 
for responder to distinguish between  - a hopeless hand <=> one that will offer a chance for game or slam.

When responder has a very poor hand, he may use a ^*u2NT^*n (A!) call to slow  down the auction here. 
Example: responder holds
@sQxxx, @hxx, @dxxx, @cQJxx. 
If the auction had been 1@d – 1@s / 2@h, responder's hand is about as poor as it could be  ... but he must bid. 

^*U2NT by responder forces opener to rebid 3@C^*n,   and then responder will bid 3@D to end the auction.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|

Most pairs also play that responder's rebid of 2 of his opening suit shows: 
a 5+ card suit and a weak hand, without good support for either of opener's suits. 

Responder's bids after the 2NT - 3@c relay:

a) Pass opener's 3@C rebid with 6+ clubs and no support for either of opener's suits, 
e.g. @sQxxx, @hxx, @dx, @cQJ10xxx.  
If opener's first suit was clubs, then passing 3@c relay shows 3 card support.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at| 

b) Bid one of opener's suits with 3+ card support. This is an absolute signoff. 
Opener's 3@C promises a minimum reverse, and responder denies the strength to bid game. 
Example: @sKxxx, @hJxx, @dx, @cJxxxx. 
Relay to 2NT and then bid 3@h. If you're lucky, you will survive.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|

Notice that I left out a rebid of responder's ^*uown^*n suit after the 2NT relay. Some pairs play that as a strong 
response, showing (usually), a 6+ card suit and at least game-going values.
Example:   
@sKQTxxx   @hxx   @dKx   @cAxx 
Bid 2NT, and after the 3@C forced response, bid 3@s. 
Opener cannot pass, and if he has a hand like @sJx, @hAKxx, @dAQxxx, @cKx, you will soar into 6@S. 
|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
If opener has a hand strong enough to bid to game opposite a 5-6 point dummy, he will bid something other 
than 3@c. Example: 
@sJ, @HAKJ10, @DAKQxx, @cK10x will make game opposite as little as @sJxxx, @hQx. @d10xx, @cQJxx. 

Opener's rebids are as follows (when breaking the "puppet 3@c" = GF): 

a) With extra length in his first bid suit and 4-5 losers, opener rebids his first suit. 
Example @sKx, @hKQJx, @dAKxxxx, @cx rebids 3@d. 
NOTE: this may be based on playing strength, not high cards.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at| 

b) With extra length in his second bid suit and 4 losers, opener rebids his second suit. 
Example: @sx, @hKQJxx, @dAKJ10xx, 
Note, since diamonds must be longer than hearts, this auction promises 5-6 or longer in hearts and diamonds.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


at|

c) With a 3-card support for responder's suit, opener may rebid 3 of responder' suit. 
Example: @sQJ8, @hAK93, @dAK1084, @c3|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|  

d) With a stopper in the unbid suit and 4-5 losers, opener may bid 3NT.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


at| 

Of course, responder may have a better hand. Supporting either of opener's suits shows 8+ support points 
and is game forcing. Example: AQxxx, Jxxx, x, xxx 
1@d-1@s / 2@h-3@h

I like to treat the 4th suit by responder as showing a partial stopper and about 8-10 points, something 
like KQxx, xxx, Jx, Q10xx. The reason is that opener will be able to evaluate a holding like Jxx as 
enough to risk 3NT.

OK – quiz 
The auction has gone 1@D – 1@s/ 2@H
What is your action on these hands
1:  @sAJxx, @h10xx, @dKxxx, @cxx   |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


at|

Answer:  3@d – all of your high cards are working and game is likely. |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


at|

2: @sKQxxx, @hxx, @dxx, @cJxxx  |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


at|

Answer:  Rebid 2@S. This is a weak bid. |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


at|

3: @sKQxxx, @hx, @dJxx, @cQJxx  |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


at|

Answer:  Rebid 2NT. 
- Partner will relay to 3@C and you will rebid 3NT 
– If partner rebids 3@d or 3@h over 2NT, you will bid 5@d 
- Of course, if partner rebids 3@s, you will happily bid 4@s, since opener will not have 3 small spades 
(most of the time). |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


at|

4: @sQJxxx, @hQxxx, @dKx, @cxx  |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


at|

Answer:  Just bid a quiet 3@h.. opener will know whether to settle for game or look for slam. 
No need to jump to game here.

OK, let's play some bridge!

|sk||at|mitche:  Bidding:  After the 4th seat 1@D, I like North's double. It's his best shot to get N/S into the auction.
Likewise, 1@h by East makes sense.
South has nowhere to go after 1@h. 
And when 1NT comes around to him again, the balancing 2@d is kind of risky at IMPS scoring, 
since the points are evenly split, but the diamonds do not rate to be.
At match points the problem is more difficult, but here, I would let E/W struggle in 1NT.
|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  E/W would make exactly 1NT, most likely.
Over 2@d West took his life in his hands with 3@c.  
East bid his hand with 1NT.
And 3@c after the double could be losing a couple of clubs, a diamond, and a couple of spades, too.
So pass 1NT, South, and pass 2@d, West.
In particular, West, you have a partner, and 3@c takes away her chance to bid her hand.

at|mitche:  Play:  Even with the 2@d call, there is something to be said for leading the @HA. 
Apart from that , the play was pretty much what I think it should have been.
One point.  South, should realize that when partner leads the @D10 and follows with the 8...(doubleton) 
West has 4 of them => hang on to 2 diamonds. Don't blank the @dJ.

at|mitche:  Bidding:  East has a near book 2@s opening at any vulnerability or form of scoring.
West has a nice hand, but let’s analyze:  
East probably has 7 losers or so for the 2@S bid. 
West has 8 losers. So the limit of the hand rates to be 9 tricks. 
Maybe 4@h is making, for N/S, maybe not.
The 4@S rates to be down 1, and the opponents haven’t bid 4@h yet. 
So I would content myself with 3@s.
|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  The opponents aren’t in the auction yet, and 3@s may be enough to dissuade them from entering.
Since I have spades, I can always take a 4@s save if they do get to 4@h.

Only hitch is that if I "walk the dog" to 4@s, I am sure to get doubled.
So all of that says you are now entering into the "poker" part of bridge - bluff, counter bluff.
If you think that 3@S will shut up your opponents, then bid 3@s
|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  If your opponents will barge into 4@h over 3@S, 
then bid 4@s immediately and transfer the guess to them.

In other words, there ain’t no right answer.   I have to know who is at the table - 
and 4@s is not the worst bid ever made in bridge.

at|mitche:  Bidding:  I like 2@s with west's hand. Even with this "giraffe", the hand just looks like 2@s to me.
North, with a giraffe of his own, bid 3@h. 
Which is a guess.. ... when the hands are from the zoo, no science is going to help.
East's bid was very, very conservative. 
If West held the @CJ, a spade slam would be 50%, and the @CK would make a slam almost 100%.
|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  I think I would start with 4@h.
If all West can find is 4@s, I would bid 5@c. Partner should get the message that I too have a monster.
West will bid 5@s and that will be that.  5@s is very, very unlucky to go down. 
It makes whenever clubs are 2-2 or when North holds any singleton honor or any 3 clubs or all 4 clubs 
-- about a 93% chance.
But the potential of East's hand calls for him to make some move toward slam. 
|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  I also need to point out that in SECOND seat, when you preempt, you need a good suit.
You should never open a weak 2 in second seat with a ratty suit.  
KQ10xxx is the absolute minimum suit for an opening 2@h or 2@s in second seat.
Why??|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


at|
Because with a passed hand in first seat, third seat rates to have points 
(pass on your right, you have 6 points.. what does that leave for third/4th hands?)
|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  One point on East's hand --- even without the @HK, it has 17 HCP and a monster spade fit. 
You are in effect playing with a "30 point deck" because the opponents hearts are good for just 1 trick. 
If pard has a 9 point weak 2, a very live possibility in second seat, vul, you are in the slam zone.
Do not discount the value of shortness in the opponents' suits!

Responder will bid 1 extra level for each K or A she holds.
So the bidding was what it should have been.|

at|mitche: Play:  With West's hand, I would lead the @SJ
Why?
a) I have a natural 3 card sequence;
b) Other things being equal, we like to lead majors because if the other guys have a major fit, 
they will most likely play in it, rather than NT. So get that spade on the table.
Declarer will doubtless cash her 10 tricks and then lead toward the @DK, but by then, the 
defense will have tricks to cash.
|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Declarer should NEVER risk the contract for an overtrick. Not at IMPS, anyway.  
If the @DA is behind the K, declarer could go down in a cold contract by trying the diamonds  
before cashing her 10 winners.

MM:  By clicking on the cards, you can play the hand Double Dummy,

at|mitche: Most people (I among them) think that West's hand is worth a 1@s opener,

BUT you can make a case for 2@s in 4th seat.  Here is the reasoning:   
a) East has some points (there are 27 HCP West cannot see, and N/S rate to have around 20 of them, max).  
So East has at least 7, and possibly as many as 11;  
b) The rationale goes on, that the bid is safe and makes it very hard for N/S to get into the auction.
|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  The argument for 1@S.
a) partner can bid his hand normally, 
b) With spades, the opponents will not outbid us.

- It is more common for a 4th seat -2@H- bid to be an "ACOL 2" = 6 losers, 6 hearts.|

mitche: Question: Should you ever open a weak 2 in 4th seat?
Marty Bergen's newest booklet will discuss 4th seat weak 2's.  
He thinks that such a bid should show a good 6-card Major suit and 10-12 HCP. 
|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Once again, the arithmetic shows that pard won't be broke, so his logic is sound, 
but not a majority opinion among experts.
Back to our bidding.|

nt||lb|*mWhat should North bid?^pass~Double~1NT~1@c^3|mb|1N|
at|Well, let’s see
a) North has a pretty good passed hand and he's pretty sure he is going to be outbid in the majors. So passing is kind of timid.
b) Double is out. We lack hearts.
c) Certainly, 2@c is reasonable, but it tends to be unilateral.
d) What about 1NT? 
|
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


nt||at|BILAsst10: 1NT should be natural.
mitche:  It ^*ucannot be^*n a natural bid. 
Why?  North passed, so he can't seriously want to overcall 1NT for play. Ever.
We know that if North bid 2NT over 1@s, it would be for the minors, right?
Why not use 1NT, an IMPOSSIBLE BID, for the minors (or 2 lower unbid suits)?
|
pg| ***** 94 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  A PASSED HAND 1NT overcall should show a goodish hand with the minors, usually 5-5 
but 5-4 if you have some compensation in the form of extra strength or shape.
So we bid 1NT.. Pard is free to pass with good major suit cards, but most of the time, he will pick his better minor.
East will now bid 2@s with his decent 3-card support  - (Unless you know unusual over unusual)
But for now, I advocate sticking to unambiguous bids, like raises.
|
pg| ***** 95 ***** |


nt||at|maggie347:  Is there a name for this for profile?
mitche:  This 1NT overcall is pretty standard, so it has no name. 
There is a convention called "sandwich NT"  where a passed-hand 1NT, when the opps have bid 2 suits, 
is a weaker, more distributional takeout than a passed-hand double.
We can discuss later.
One last thought before East bids. 
|
pg| ***** 96 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  I recommend that you should use a double over an unusual NT to show:
a) poor fit for opener's major and 
b) the ability to double for penalty 1 of the 2 suits the NT bidder promises.|

nt||lb|*mWhat should South bid?^pass~3@d^1|
mb|p|at|mitche: I vote for pass, but I would not fault a 3@d bid... Jxx is nice holding in clubs when pard promises at least a good 4... 
but I have too much wasted strength in the majors and not enough length to compensate for my weak diamonds.|

lb|*mWhat should West bid?^pass~3@s~4@s^1|mb|p|at|mitche: How many losers will East have for 2@s?
msphola:  9
mitche:  If East has as few as 8 losers, he will bid more than a simple 2@s. (check that losing trick count handout!)
So West knows East has at best a 9 loser hand.   West has 7 losers.   
And the @D holding is unappetizing since North "bid" (implied) diamonds.
So we pass.
North is done, he bid his all with 1NT.|

pc|CK|pc|CA|pc|C9|at|mitche: Why should South play the 9, not the 8?
The @CK promises the Queen, and South knows that it's safe for the defense to continue clubs. 
A shift could blow a trick, so the 9 helps the defense from committing suicide.

As it is, he has no choice but to play the Ace, hoping for 2-2 spades. 
Also, note that there is nothing West needs to ruff in dummy. |

at|BILAsst10: I have never come across the 1NT used there in that way.
mitche:  It is a very common treatment. I think you can find it in Steve Robinson's book on Washington Standard
and I am pretty sure Marty Bergen discusses it too.

MM:  By clicking on the cards, you can play the hand Double Dummy,
