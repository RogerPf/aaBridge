fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, 
if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. 
We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. 
My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, 
so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving 
and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."


Mitch Edelman aka   "mitche"






MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.

fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|
at|^b@2mitche:  This evening's lesson covers splinter bids. 
A splinter bid is an unusual jump (usually a bid above a jump raise of a suit) by either partner 
to show game-going values and a singleton or void in the suit being bid.

Example 1: Opener bids 1@S and responder holds   @sQ10xx   @hx   @dKQxxx   @cKJx. 
This hand evaluates to around 14 dummy points in spades, so we want to be in game. 
A 4@h bid shows the singleton small heart, 4-card support, and game values.

Either opener or responder can splinter. Let's begin by examining splinters by responder.  
For now, we will assume that there is no interference bidding.   
A splinter bid shows the following by responder:  

4-card support for opener's major suit, 13-15 dummy points, 
A small singleton (at most a queen, preferably less) or void in the splinter suit. 
Do not splinter with a singleton Ace, and avoid splintering with a singleton king.

Quiz time: Opener starts 1@H.     What do you bid with each of these hands:
a)  @sAxx   @hJ109x   @dx   @cQJ10xx 
b)  @Sx   @HJ10xx   @dAKxx   @cQJxx
c)  @sAQx   @HAKxx   @dx   @cQJ10xx
d)  @sAx   @hKxxx   @dQxxx   @cQJx

Your answers?  Think about these hands as I present my thoughts. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
 
a) This hand is not quite strong enough for a splinter, so we will make whatever limit major raise we use, 
either a Bergen 3@d or a 3@h limit raise. 
b) This is a fine 3@s splinter, being worth 11 HCP + 2 more for the singleton. 
c) With 16 HCP, this hand is too good for a splinter bid, so we will show a big raise with a Jacoby 2NT.  
If opener signs off at 4@h, we will make one slam try with 4@s.
d) While the point range is correct (12) for a game raise, there is no singleton, 
so we would like to bid a Bergen 3@D here.  Depending on how you and your partner treat Jacoby 2NT.  
Your system may tell you to bid 2NT 
(I downgrade the hand to a limit raise because of the quacky nature of the hand and its sterile shape). 


bjh346: What is the top point range for a splinter?

mitche:  For responder to splinter, I suggest 13-15 Support Points (Dummy Points).  
That translates to about a good 9 to 12 or so HCP.  
The reason for that is that with more strength, there is a pretty fair chance for slam, so we like to conserve bidding room. 
Think of this as a cousin of "fast arrival."

Notice hand a) has a quacky 8 points, which is too thin for a splinter, and hand c) is too strong.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

^*bShowing a void:^*n  

If responder has a void, he shows it with a repeat cue bid of the splinter suit. 

The 30-point deck:
When there is no wastage in the splinter suit, slam becomes easier to make with limited values.  
For example: 
@sKQx   @hKQxxx   @dxxx   @cAx   opposite   @sAx   @hAxxx   @dx   @cKxxxx  is a laydown slam with just 25 HCP. 
The auction: 1@h – 4@d/4NT - 5@h/6@h.  
Declarer plans to ruff 2 diamonds in dummy, and if the defense slips up, 13 tricks may come home. 

^*bOpener Rebids after a splinter bid:^*n
 
The first thing opener should do after partner splinters is to reevaluate his hand.  
Opener's ideal holding in the splinter suit is either Axxx or 3 or 4 small. 
The worst holdings are combinations like Q10xx or KJx, where you know that your honors are not working for you.
With a holding like KQJx we may think about 3NT, since dummy won't be doing much ruffing of our side suit.

Now you should see why the splinter must promise 4-card support.  
Responder's trumps have the very important job of ruffing declarer's midgets in the splinter suit, 
or allowing for a dummy reversal. 

Suppose you opened 1@S and heard responder bid 4@d. Rate these hands for exploring for slam:
a)  @sAQJxx   @hQJ   @dxxxx   @cAx    or     b)  @sAQJxx   @hxx   @dQJxx   @cAx.  

Who would rather have hand a?   And who would rather have hand b?|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|

I rate hand A as the better hand - Why? 
If partner has game-going values with no diamond strength, we have at least 25 HCP in our suits. 
If responder has only the @SK  @HA  @CK and  either the @CQ or@HK (12 or 13 HCP) 
we will be making a 27 HCP slam, most likely.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

^*bGuideline:^*n If responder splinters, count your total points, ignoring unsupported honors in the splinter suit. 
If you have 15+, then look for slam. 

Example: you have  @sK109xxx   @hx   @dAKQ   @cxxx   and start with 1@S. 
Responder bids 4@C. 
Your hand has 12 HCP plus a 6th trump and a singleton, about 16 total points.  
Control-bid 4@D. 
Responder bids 4@h (showing first or second round control). 
You now bid 4NT, and partner says 5@h (2 aces without the @SQ). 
You know he has the @SA and @HA, so you  happily bid 6@S on your 10 card fit. 
How do you know that he has these 2 aces? 
We do not splinter with singleton aces, that's how.  
Responder's hand -  @sAJxx   @HAJ10   @dJxxxx  @cx 
with 23 HCP-- and 6@S is virtually indestructible.

^*bWhen opener has a singleton:^*n 

When opener has a 4-card fit for responder's Major, a singleton, and a hand that evaluates to 18+ dummy points, 
he may find a splinter bid. 

Example: You open 1@c with  @sAJ82   @hKQx   @dx   @cKQJxx.  Responder bids 1@s. 
Your best bid here is 4@d. 

^*bGuideline:^*n  You should have at least 15 HCP outside your singleton suit 
(and, as usual, no A or K in the splinter suit).|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
  

Assume that the auction begins 1@D – 1@s - What is your rebid on each of these hands?

a) @sKQJ   @hAQxx   @dAJ10xx   @cx;   
b) @sJ10xx   @hx   @dKQJ10xx   @cAx;  
c) @sAJ10   @hx   @dAQJxxx   @cAQx,   
d) @sK10xx   @hx   @dAQJxx   @cAQx; 
e) @sQJ10xx   @hx   @dAQJxx   @cKx.

Answers: |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|
a) I bid 2@h - only 3-card trump support . 
I expect to reach game somewhere, but 2@h gives us the best chance to reach the best game. 
I will support spades later, revealing the singleton club 
(when I bid 3 suits naturally, I have at most 1 card in the 4th suit).

b) This hand is a bit too weak for a game-forcing 3@h bid. I would bid 3@s, invitational. 

c) I want to force to game  (maybe a 4-3 spade fit? Maybe a diamond slam?)   So an invitational 3@D is out.  
An immediate spade raise is out, too, because I have just 3 of them. So what's left? 
3@c, a jump-shift.

d) 3@h -  Perfect splinter bid. Why 3@h?  
A 2@h bid is a reverse, so 3@h, being an unusual jump, shows the singleton heart. 
This allows responder to sign off with 4@s, bid 3NT when  appropriate, or control-bid below 4@s. 

e) The 5th spade is enough to convince me to splinter with 3@h. 
If responder has as little as  @sKxxx  @hxxx  @dxx  @cQxxx,   4@s is on a finesse.  

And some of your partners might pass 1@s with this hand.  
Note that when I can make the double-jump of 3@h to show a splinter, I do. 
Some refer to this as a "mini-splinter."  I think it's just common sense to leave room to explore.

^b@2^*bOther splinter auctions:^*n

When you play Jacoby 2NT, opener's rebid of a new suit at the 3-level shows a singleton or void 
(and a jump to the 4 level shows a second 5 card suit). 
Responder can now evaluate  his hand and quality of fit. 

Example: opener starts 1@s, responder holds  @sK10xx  @hxxx  @dAKx  @cAQx and bids 2NT. 

After opener's 3@h rebid, responder can bid 6@s (or, if he is very cautious, 4NT, followed by a trump Queen ask).

On some occasions, you may splinter with just 3-card support. 
This situation arises when someone has a 6-card suit. 

Example: 
Opener has @sQx   @hKQ9xxx   @dAQx   @cxxx   and responder holds  @sAKxxx   @hAxx   @dKxxx   @cx. 
The auction was: 1@h – 1@s/2@h – 4@c/4@d - 4NT/ 5@s – 6@s. 

^*bAnother way to approach things:^*n 
 
When opener bids 1@h or 1@S, a jump to 3 of the other Major is usually undefined. 
Some partnerships use these bids to show a hand with 4-card support, minimum game raise values, 
and an ^*bunspecified singleton^*n. 
Marty Bergen included this treatment in his original description of Bergen Raises. 

Here's the idea: 
It is very unlikely that you will want to play in 3NT after responder reveals a 9-card fit and shortness, 
so opener's rebid of 3NT shows extra values and asks for responder's short suit.  
Responder bids 4@C for club shortness, 4@d for diamond shortness, and 4@h for shortness in the other Major. 
|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|
^b@2Here are some examples: 

a)  @sxxx   @hKJ10xx   @dKx   @cKQx   
After a 3@s response to opener's 1@h, just sign off in 4@h. 
Responder needs 3 aces for slam, and this uninformative auction gives the defenders less information to help them 
with the opening lead and no chance for a lead-directing double.  
Note that you do not know responder's singleton here, nor do you care. 
Your hand is too weak for a slam try.

b)  @sAKx   @hAQ10xx   @dJxxx   @cx  
After 1@h – 3@s, opener should rebid 3NT. 
Responder will (most likely) show shortness in spades or diamonds. 
If it's diamonds, opener can bid 4@s, inviting responder to control-bid a minor suit Ace (or void in diamonds).

c)  @sx   @hAKxxx   @dAKJxx   @cAx  
After 1@H – 3@s,  
I treat 4@C as an Italian control bid, asking partner to show first or second round controls. 
If partner bids 4@d I know it is his singleton, and I'll bid  4NT, RKC Blackwood. 
If pard shows an Ace, I will ask for the trump Queen.  
If pard shows that card and a king, I will bid 7@h.  
Also, if pard bids 4@h over 4@c, at IMPS I will bid 6@d giving him a choice of slams.  

As a side-note, this hand shows the value of using 1430 RKC.

pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2
^*bSummary^*n 


A jump 1 level higher than either a reverse or a jump raise should be treated as a splinter bid, 
showing a singleton or void in the splinter suit. 

In almost all cases, this shows a 4-card support and for responder, 12-15 dummy points, for opener, 18+ dummy points. 
When responder's hand is stronger than 15 dummy points, he should prefer a Jacoby 2NT response.  

We do not splinter with a singleton A or K. 
There's a good chance that a high honor will solidify the other hand's holding in that suit.  
When a hand splinters and the other hand has no wastage in that suit, you may be able to reach a slam with 
as few as 26 HCP. 

And as always, make sure to discuss your bids and responses with each other before you and your partner agree 
to use splinters,  or any convention for that matter!

BILAsst10: Why 3@S response to 1@H open? - I think I missed something.

mitche: 3@s is the other Major.  A Bergen raise to 3@C or 3@D shows 4-card support, and less than GF values.  
The jump to 3 of the other Major is stronger and promises an unspecified singleton.  
So the auction 1@h – 3@s/3NT – 4@d promises GF values for responder and singleton @d. 
The idea is that opener asks for the singleton only when he has a hand worth a slam try.  
You don't reveal responder's shape or allow an opponent to double a splinter bid for lead, 
or possible sacrifice unless you are strong enough that you don't care. 

NOTE that the Bergen jump to "3 of the other Major" means that you have 2 different ways to splinter over a Major. 
If you use the Bergen technique, you may decide to use jumps to the  4-level for something other than splinter.  
|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

And I strongly suggest you discuss all of this with your partner, preferably before you start using these ideas.
Splinters are wonderful tools for bidding to distributional slams, but if you aren't on the same page, 
you may wind up declaring in your 3-1 fit. 

And believe me (the voice of experience), it's not very easy to hold a 3-1 fit to just 2 losers. 

This is the end of the lesson on splinters.

at|BILAsst10: Should north double after 1@S? 
mitche: No, North should not.  
If you use sandwich NT, you may want to bid 1NT - but double should show better defense.   
And technically, 1NT should show better distribution.

at|mitche: Play: Declarer should reason as follows: The clubs are pretty sure to produce 6 tricks.  
I have the @SAKQ and the @DA.   What could go wrong?  
Well, suppose North gets in with a diamond and shoots a heart through to South's  Ace. Then 3NT goes pffft.  
Therefore declarer should win the first diamond, so the defense does not have a chance to make a killing shift!

DO NOT HOLD UP IF IT EXPOSES YOU TO A POTENTIALLY LETHAL SHIFT!!
Next - with 10 clubs, at trick 2, play the @CA.  If both opponents follow, the Q will fall on the second round. |

at|mitche: Bidding: After 1@h by N, East should  bid 1@S, I think.  Here is why:  
Modern style is - if responder can make a natural 1-level bid over an overcall, he should.  So E can bid 1@s.  The @HK is a good card (the suit was bid by N in front of the K) and East has 5 spades. 
With only 4 spades, E would, of course, make a negative X.|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt||at|realrowdy:  Would we end in game?
mitche: well, we shall see.  
If E bids 1@s, S might bid some number of hearts.  
W will get excited and bid 3@s or maybe just blast to 4.  
In 4@s, declarer should take 10 tricks, losing 1 spade and 2 aces, I think -  Or 9, perhaps.

at|mitche: Play: If declarer is careful, she will not allow the defense to ruff a @D winner.  
But a club lead and continuation may beat 4@S 
- club ace, club, and when declarer finesses in trump, a third round of clubs allows the defense to score 
a second trump.
(MM: But East is declaring 4@s, so south would be on lead, and holding @sQxx as a nutural trump trick
and Partner bidding hearts.. that club lead from south is not likely)

at|mitche: Bidding:  What do you call a 7-card suit headed by the AQ?
anniebmisc:  Trumps.
mitche: Indeed.  2@s by East is a bit of an underbid (but 3@s is definitely an overbid) 
and on a potential misfit, it's better to go slowly.  
Over 2NT, East should bid 3@s, though.  And west should probably pass 3@s. 
The @HQJ look pretty useless (they aren't, but... ), and the @D suit is ratty and probably unsupported.

sk||

at|mitche: Bidding: :  I think the South hand is worth a 4@h bid, but I would not do it. 
I would bid 1@s and then over 1NT.  I would then bid 4@h. That would accomplish 2 things:
a) it would get the message about club shortness across, and 
b) it would show a pretty good hand, too.
Maybe I am being devious in my thinking.  But bidding 3 suits 
(the jump in @H's must be on either 3 very good hearts or 4 of them) shows shortness in the 4th one.|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: 1@S is forcing and natural.  By the way, the 4th suit forcing bid is 2@s here.  
The auction   1@c – 1@d/1@h-1@s is forcing for one round, and all suits are natural.
tutootsie:   Are you saying South should bid 1 spade instead of 1 diamond?
mitche: No, I am saying that South should bid 1@s over 1@h.  
South is worth about 19 points in support of @h, so she will insist on game in @h, 
but showing the shape and pinpointing to North that spade cards are good, 
club cards bad for the fit is an advantage.

at|mitche: Play:  I would lead spades on the actual auction - 
a) It's the unbid suit;  
b) diamonds are declarer's suit, and E/W are not likely to get any ruffs in the suit.  
And if they do, it's with a natural trump trick :(
BILAsst10: Lead the @SQ?
mitche: Right -  they didn't bid spades or look for NT, so E/W rate to have some spade cards.
dmac5:  I think we go down with spade lead. |
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: No, you ditch 2 spades on the @CAK -  lose just 2 trumps and a spade.  
One point - as play developed, declarer should discard spades from her hand on the high diamonds and 
never ruff the suit. 
The defense will win the @HJ but then declarer discards all his black card losers on the @D's.
Gotta count the cards!!!

at|mitche: Bidding:  I am not sure I would bid 1@d on the S hand.   
An overcall is primarily a lead-director, and Jxxxx is not the kind of suit you want to hold when pard leads 
the K from Kx.
Anyway, when S does bid 1@d, West shows 5 spades with his 1@s bid (no, 4), and North, looking at a pretty cruddy hand 
with lots of @D's, probably should preemptively raise them to 3@d.
Yes, the vulnerability is wrong, but E/W can't have enough trumps to double.  
And if they do let N/S play 3@d, it won't be horrible. |
pg| ***** 96 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Now, what should E do over 2@d? 
Her hand was originally a pretty bare minimum opener, but the auction has been very kind for her.  
She knows about the 9-card fit. (the 1@s bid only promisses 4 => knows 8-card fit)
Her hand has 10 HCP, a quality club suit worth another point, 
the 6th club is worth 2 more points, and the void at least 4 more. |
pg| ***** 97 ***** |


nt||at|So I guess the Bergen evaluation for this hand is around 18 points. 
Bid 3@S!  Then W will have an easy 4@s bid, and that makes with very little drama.
Well, could be 4 @'s, now that I think on it.  W could not neg X (does not have 4-4 M), so may be only 4 @'s in west hand.  
Still, E bids 3@s and W raises to 4.
