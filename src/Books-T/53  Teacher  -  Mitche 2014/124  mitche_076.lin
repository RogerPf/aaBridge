fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue (who loves puttering with the plants in 
the back yard), 3 (spoiled) rescue cats and aquaria.

Mitch is also an active bridge player. 
Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player.

"When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I recommend a few bidding tools for all of us: 
first, forcing No Trump, Jacoby 2NT, Bergen Raises, and Key Card Blackwood (1430 recommended).
Also, I suggest using Jacoby Transfers and, if you know them, Texas Transfers.
Negative doubles are standard thru 2@s (or if you're OK with them, thru 3@d.),
and best that you stick to standard signals and carding.

Questions are always OK, so please ask if you need explanations.
I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."
Mitch Edelman aka mitche 


MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.
Thank you Eileen (wyoming33) for sending the hands and editing the chatlog! @h

pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|mitche: Bidding:  North would do better in the long run to pass this kind of hand. Why?|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|
a) It lacks 2 quick tricks;  
b) The spade suit is pretty ratty, even with K1098, the suit's kind of thin.
gypsy1308: Open 2@S?
mitche:  Whether you open 2@S is a matter of style.  Some would, some not. My style is to have a decent suit,
but some people will preempt on J10xxxx, xxx, xx, Qx.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  At any form of scoring except matchpoints, that kind of preempt is suicidal, I think.  
So, no, I would not start 2@s.
At IMPS, you need some safety in preempting.  You won't always catch pard with 3 good spades for your weak 2.
Anyway, here the bid was 1@s, and raised to 2@s.  This is about as good a hand as you can bid 2@s on -- 9 HCP 
and 3 spades to 2 honors.  
Any more, and you should treat the hand as a limit raise 
(which we do  by bidding 1NT and then raising spades to the 3 level).|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  All right, so now 2@s reaches West.  What are her options? 3@C or ????
Some people will prefer to double rather than bid 3@C -- why? |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


at|
Finding a 4-4 major-suit fit is pretty important.  If E/W have a game it is easier to win 10 tricks than 11, 
so we look for that 4-4 major suit fit (well, 8 card fit) first, and 5@C is sort of the consolation prize.

So doubling is probably the best percentage bid.
All right, West bid 3@C and now back to North.|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Having opened very aggressively and hearing a bid that promises at most a decent 9, 
North decided to bid 3@S, probably thinking to take a save against 3@c 
(at least I hope that is why 3@s was bid).
When 3@s comes back to West, she passed.  What do you all think of that pass?|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: I do not like it very much.
West has a pretty good hand, worth more than the 14 HCP.
That is part 1.. part 2, she has pretty decent support for any other suit East might care to bid.
So I would balance with a double.|
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Note that this should not be treated as penalty X. Why? |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


at|
a) If West has spades, she is sitting in front of the spade length, so any spade strength will not be as 
helpful as if East had them.
b) she has a very offense-oriented hand with support for both unbid suits and a club suit that can stand 
playing opposite a singleton 10 or small doubleton.
c) East might have a spade stack and a random King or so, in which case 3@s may get clobbered.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  In any event, having freely bid at the 3 level, West shows a powerful hand with a reopening X.
If West doubles, East should bid 4@h.  4@h will probably roll in.
BILAsst10:  West sort of denied @H with the @C bid.
mitche:  Yes, she did, but even so, the reopening X says she can tolerate @h.  
Maybe East would bid 4@c   (or even 5@c).
Over a reopening X, I might also bid 5@C, since I have 3 working cards opposite pard's strong hand.
And we note that E/W would have no difficulty getting to 4@h over a takeout X of 2@s.|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  I do recommend X because the hand can stand to play in a 4-4 heart fit.  
If I don't X, I run the risk of missing 4@h.
While 3@c rates to be the safest contract for E/W, it isn't going to pay very well.

at|mitche:  Play:  East has 4 spades and should think about a ^*bforcing game^*n.  
Make declarer shorten her trumps to the point where East has longer trump than declarer. 
If that happens, then E/W will have control of the hand. 
The club ruff tells E/W that they want to continue playing clubs every chance they have.

So when East wins her @HQ, she plays a second club, reducing declarer to the same length in spades. 
(By the way, declarer should NOT cover the second club. That king prevents West from attacking the suit.)|

pg| ***** 39 ***** |


sk||
at|mitche: Bidding:  Forcing NT.. what is it, and when is it used? |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


at|
a) Forcing NT is a 1NT bid over partner's opening bid of 1@h or 1@s, but never over 1@d or 1@C;
b) Use it when responder has no convenient 1-level bid and is not strong enough for a 2 over 1 response.
So here, 1NT shows a hand with 6 to 9 or maybe 10 points, no 4-card Major -- SAME AS STANDARD AMERICAN.|
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


at|
So what should North do with her 12 HCP hand?
Well, it depends on what your agreements are.  
I think that standard treatment would be to bid 2NT to show 11-12 HCP.|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  If you treat 1@D - 3NT as 13-15, with 4333 hand, then 2NT is the bid North would make.
If you use inverted minors, then 2@d is OK.
But otherwise, you would have to improvise with 2@c (ugly, I know, but).
We can discuss inverted minors and "criss-cross" sometime. 
I prefer to save those for advanced intermediates, since they complicate some other areas of bidding.
Now North bid 1NT. 
What should South do over 1NT, assuming that North had the 6-9 or 10 point hand the bid usually promises?|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


nt||
at|WestElsdon:  pass
mitche:  Yes, pass ... 13+9 = 22 HCP maximum, well short of the 25 or so you like to have for 3NT. 
And 1NT is going to take 8 tricks without too much effort.

So let's suppose the auction went 1@D - 2NT. 
Now, South counts 11-12 HCP in responder's hand.  Should he raise to 3NT?|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  I might raise to 3.  
a) being vulnerable, I want to be in close games - the game bonus vul makes it more attractive to reach game.   
b) the 5-card @D suit may produce 4 tricks opposite as little as @DJ10 or even @dJxx.  
So I go. 
It's kind of "resulting" for us to say South should pass. Look at it this way.  
If the E/W hands were reversed, then 3NT would probably make.|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  I go at any form of scoring, IMPs or matchpoints, because of the vulnerability.

BILAsst10: North does not bid a major, so south knows they are weak in the Majors and so do the ops.
mitche:  North may have strength in the Majors, if not length.

at|mitche: Play:  North has 8 tricks with the @h opening lead and should lead a club at some point,
which is what she did. But she must play the @CK, not the @c9.
She needs 1 club trick, and losing to the @CJ guarantees that the defense will shoot a heart thru the vulnerable @HK.
So the game is a 50-50 proposition, as long as she plays the @cK. 
Well, game is 100% if East has the @CA, 0% if West has it, so 50-50.|

SK||

at|mitche: Bidding:  What should North do over 2NT (unusual for the minors)?|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


at|
A part of the "unusual over unusual" convention that everyone should know and use:  
If third hand doubles an unusual 2NT, it means "I can defeat one (or maybe both) of their minors."

So North should hammer 2NT.  Double means "I can beat a 3 level contract in at least 1 of their minors."
If North does double 2NT, East will remove to 3@d, and South should PASS, giving North a chance to make a second bid.  
Maybe North has diamonds.|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  In practice, North will either double 3@d or with her actual hand, bid 3NT. 
If North bids 3NT, South should bid 4@h (since North will almost certainly have at least 2 hearts).
But South should not bid 3@h over 3@d.
Why?  |
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


at|
3@d doubled would get N/S +500, which is more than they can earn at 3NT.
As long as the vulnerability is as it is, doubling is a pretty good idea.      If N/S can make game, 
they have enough strength to beat 3 of a minor by 2 tricks- and if not, then +200 is better than any part score.

|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


sk||

at|mitche: Bidding:  1@s and a forcing 1NT seem perfectly reasonable. 
North is too strong for 1NT, so 1@s is quite correct.
2@h is a pretty risky bid at this vulnerability on only a 5-card suit. 
West should have another honor somewhere, perhaps a second club picture to support the @CQ.
But 2@h was the bid.
What should North do with that big hand? |
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  With the balance of power, North must do something, and 3@h is the bid I like. 
It says: bid 3NT with a heart stopper.
And if South does bid 3NT, it makes at least 10 tricks, depending on the lead.
Keep this in the back of your mind:  
^*bAn immediate cue bid at the three level by OPENING side of an overcall asks the other guy for a stopper^*n.
If the auction were something like 1@C - 1@h (1@S), then a 2@s bid conventionally is a GF cue bid by opener.  
It just says "describe your hand."|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Cue bidding can get pretty confusing.  
Make sure that you and your regular partners have discussed what you mean with them.  
I suggest reading Marty Bergen's bid better books.
ecolodge:  If South does not have a @H-stopper, what does she bid?
mitche:  South without a @h stop does something intelligent.. like support opener's suit on Jx or better .. 
or bid a long suit of your own. |
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


nt||at|The thing is, that North MUST have a pretty strong hand  for that 3@h cue bid. 
North has about the weakest possible hand for that call.
ecolodge: Wait ... North bids 3@H, can't play in 2@S, so what is South's bid if no @H-stopper?
mitche:  South bids 4@D here. Otherwise, she returns to spades with Jx or better.  
Or bids a good 5-card suit of her own.
North promises a parking place if N/S don't have a heart stop, 
and that spade suit is good enough to play opposite Jx, or in a pinch, 10x.

at|mitche: Play:  Declarer has 2 hearts and a spade and at least 1 club to lose. 
The defense (East) does best to ruff the 4th diamond and play another heart. 
Declarer then will lose 2 clubs and be held to 10 tricks...as well

at|mitche: Bidding:  I like the 4@h splinter bid very much.  It tells North that he has no heart losers.
BTW, Kadu, what did you mean with 6@h?
kadu:  Thought marika was bidding Hearts, missed splinter.
mitche:  If N/S don't get confused in the bidding, they should reach 7@s with little difficulty.

After 4NT, and the 5@h rebid, North can just about count 13 tricks. 
5 spades, @HA and 2 ruffs, and if South has a heart singleton, how many clubs does she have ? |
pg| ***** 109 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  If it's 4, then no club loser, if it's 3, a club ruff, and no @D losers. So 13 tricks are there.
I would not open 2@c because the @S suit was not good enough to be trumps in a game contract opposite 
a small doubleton.  
Something like  @sAKJ10xx, @hKQx, @dKQJ, @cx is a fine 2@c opener.
Someone asked about 5@h.  Playing key card BW, 5@h shows 2 keycards, lacking the trump Q.
But here, I would bid 5@s.  The 5th spade in responder's hand means they have a 10 card fit. 
The odds that a 10-card fit with the A and K has a loser is about 1 in 32.|

nt||
at|mitche:  Sidebar: the 4NT bidder must have at least 1 key card and the trump Q, or 2 key cards.

sk||

at|mitche:  Bidding:  North can take his time with a 2@c bid.  
Since it's game-forcing, he will have a chance to discover if South has an above-minimum hand, 
in which case 6@C or 6@d (or even 6NT) might make.
I suggest a bidding sequence of 1@D - 2@c/ 2N - 4N/ pass.
Note that 4NT is quantitative, asking South to bid 6 on a maximum.
South should accept on 14 points, pass otherwise.|
pg| ***** 119 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: North might be a bit light for 4NT, since South has a maximum of 14 HCP (usually)
(with a balanced 15, South opens 1NT).
BILAsst10: I always have trouble with that unless 1 or 2 NT are opened 
- how do you quantify a good hand - min or max or just average?
mitche:  Well, I use this idea:  the fewer bids, the weaker the hand (sort of fast arrival).
So 4NT would be weaker than if North had made a third forcing bid, e.g. 3@h or 3@s over 2NT.
Note that North would not likely have a real 4-card suit for 3@h over 2NT.|
pg| ***** 120 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  Why?|
pg| ***** 121 ***** |


at|
a) South would have denied a 4-card Major with 2NT and 
b) With 4 hearts, North would have probably bid 1@h over 1@d.
So these kinds of "impossible bids" show even more strength than a direct jump to 4NT over 2NT.

Another thing that you should discuss with your regular partner.  What do "impossible bids" mean?|
pg| ***** 122 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  That is how you know, whether the bid invites with more than a minimum, versus a maximum.

BILAsst10: Think they are more advanced bids. 
mitche:  Yes, they are.  But you will encounter them in tournaments all the time.  
So if you play in them, you should at least know what they mean.

at|mitche: Play: When the @d's fail to divide evenly, North decided to duck a @c, just in case the suit divided evenly. 
If they do not, then he should just claim his 9 tricks.
In the near future, I will do a lesson on cue bids for fun, profit, and getting to the right contract.|
