^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL’s Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that “practice makes perfect”, but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss” sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament players. We will also discuss play from declarer’s and defenders’ perspective.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|^b@2^*BHand Evaluation - Additional Gadgets ^*N

Welcome to 2 over 1 bid, play, discuss.

First, I want to start this week's class with a short lesson to introduce a useful convention.
The lesson is on hand evaluation and these observations come (mostly) from "Secrets of Winning Bridge", 
a classic written by Jeff Rubens (back in 1969).|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


at|

First, we all know the "work" point count system: 4321.  4321 point count works best on balanced hands.   
It ignores 10's, 9's, and distribution. 
10's and 9's are important, and your hand will play better if you have more than the 2 you expect to be dealt.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


at|
Aces and Kings are worth more than their "work point count".     Why?  
They control suits.
Quacks (Queens and Jacks) are overvalued, because they don't come into their own until later in the play of a suit.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


at|

When you evaluate your hand, you don’t do it in a vacuum.  
The bidding and partner's hand enter into answering the question   "How good is my hand?".
Fitting cards in partner's suit are important.  Unsupported honors don’t pull their weight.  
A singleton king, for example, may be worthless to your side.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|

But we can look at our hand to get a pretty good idea of whether our hand is a "good" 13, or a "bad" 13   
For example, high cards in long suits improve your hand.
Example 1:   @SK10   @H9xxxx  @DAQ   @CJxxx  (10 HCP) is not nearly as good a hand as these 10:  
@Sxx  @HKQ109x  @Dxx  @cAJxx 
 
Rubens' FIRST PRINCIPLE:  "Other things being equal, honors are more valuable in your long suit than your short suit. The longer your suit is, the more valuable the honor." |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt|
|fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|b|at|^b@2^*BHand Evaluation - Additional Gadgets^*N (Cont)

Example 2:
Your hand is @SAx  @HKx  @DJxx  @C10xxxxx    What do you bid if pard opens 1NT?|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


at|
At best, it's a raise to 2NT.
But @Sxx  @Hxx  @Dxxx  @CAKJ10xx is an almost automatic raise to 3.

The 2 hands have identically the same high card strength, but the concentration of strength in the club suit 
pretty much assures you of 5 tricks at NT,  6 if the @CQ is  friendly.

This leads to Rubens  SECOND  PRINCIPLE (Concentrated Strength): 

Other things being equal, honors in combination are worth more than isolated honors 
Example:  Suppose you have Axx and Kxx in 2 suits:  You have 1½ quick tricks, 
but  AKx  xxx   is 2 quick tricks. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|

How the auctions affects hand value:
Example 1:  You hold @cKQxx, a nice holding.   But suppose you knew that your pard was void in clubs....  
Now that holding is not so nice.

Example 2:  You have @SAKxxx  @Hxxx  @DQxx  @CAx and open 1@S  
Suppose partner splinters with 4@H.  
You would be happy to look for a spade slam.  
But suppose partner splinters with 4@D...  Now you will just sign off in 4@S|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


at|

Some of you may be using the Help Suit Game Try (HSGT)   (in Europe, these may be known as "trial bids")
The idea is - we use "constructive" raises of 1M to 2M.  
If opener has a hand that evaluates to 16 or so points after the raise, she may want to get to game if 
there aren’t 3 quick losers in a side suit.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||fp||cp|2|cs|3|at|^b@2

Example:  You open 1@S with   @sAJ10xx  @hxxx  @dAx  @cAQx
You have how many losers?|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


at|
Your loser count is 7.  
How many losers would pard have for a 2@S (constructive) raise?
That is on a good hand.. you'd raise to 2@S with either  @sQxx  @hxx  @dKxxx  @cKxxx which has 8 losers 
or with @sQxx  @hxxx  @dKxx  @cKxxx - which has 9.  
So you want to be in  game with hand 1 but not with hand 2.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|
So a help-suit asks pard: "Do you have 3 quick losers in my help suit? (@h here)".
If responder can keep the losers to 2 in the help suit, she raises to game, otherwise, she signs off at 3. 
(MM: P, I have a 7-loser hand, but if you can make it a 6 loser hand with shortness in hearts,
and you have an 8-loser hand yourself => 24 - ( 6+8 = 14) => 10 winners.  ) 
So they are useful to get you to close games. |

^*BHand Evaluation - Additional Gadgets^*N (Cont)
There are lots of variations on this idea, and here is a gadget that has a lot of support among tournament players.
It is part of the Washington Standard (the system played a lot here in the DC area) 
put together by World Champion and Hall of Fame player Steve Robinson.

Suppose that you use "constructive" major suit raises (3 card support, 7-9 HCP);  
The auction starts off 1@S - 2@S. 
If opener bids a new suit at the 3 level, it's a game try of some sort 
(most people use "help suit" game tries, some use "short suit" game tries).|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


at|
 
After a raise of 1@S or 1@H to 2@S/@H, opener rebids 2NT (alertable!). 
This is NOT looking to play in NT, but rather to find out where pard has shape. 
Responder bids a short suit (xx or shorter). Opener now has a better idea of whether her high cards are working.
 
Example: Opener has  @sAQJxx  @hxxx  @dKQx  @cAx 
If responder has something like  @sKxx  @hxxx  @dJxx  @cKxxx, you do not wish to be in game, 
but with  @sKxx  @hxx  @dJxxx  @cKxxx, 4@S doesn't need more than a 3-2 @s split (and no diamond ruff).|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


nt||fp||cp|2|cs|3|at|^b@2
So opener bids 2NT (alertable) -- Responder signs off with 3@S on the first hand (@sKxx,@Hxxx, @DJxx,@CKxxx). 
(Opener could open 1NT with the first hand, but some people will open 1@S with that hand)
On the second hand, responder bids 3@H (also alertable - @sKxx,@Hxx, @DJxxx,@CKxxx).
Opener now knows to bid 4@S, since there is no wastage in hearts, 
AND dummy will be able to ruff the third round @h. 

Now, there is a second advantage for using this gadget.  
When opener bids a new suit at the 3 level, it shows a better hand than a simple game try, for example: 
@sAQ10xx  @Hxx  @DKQJx  @CAx|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |

Cliff228: Can you use both HSGT and SSGT?
mitche:  You should pick 1 or the other.  Some like SSGT,  some HSGT - 
My preference is to use SSGT, but most of my pards are not quite that enlightened :)
Reason for SSGT - if responder has good stuff in it, she can escape to 3NT. 
Example:  @sQxx  @HAK10xx  @Dxx  @CAJx   makes SSGT and if pard has something like: 
@SJx  @HQxx  @DKQ10x  @Cxxxx   can bid 3NT.|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |

My example may not make (I'd need a bit stronger spade stop) but I am winging the examples here.

OK, let's play some bridge.

Novella24:  With 12 HCP and nothing to bid, is pass the correct bid?
mitche:  East can double 1@S for takeout. She has ideal shape and while the hand is a bit light in high cards, I would get in.  West will bid 1NT (she will NOT pass 1@S X, her spades aren't quite strong enough).  
If East does pass 1@S, she should double 2@S for takeout, and W should bid 2NT.  
When the @S9 comes down, E/W can scramble for 7 tricks..

sk||

at|mitche: Bidding:  1@C and 1@D were book bids.  
If you are playing "Walsh style", then East's correct rebid is 1NT, not 1@H 
But if you bid your suits "up the line", then 1@H is OK.  Most people play Walsh today 
(Frank Stewart, the bridge columnist, is a notable exception)  
Maybe next week I should interrupt the hand evaluation lessons to discuss Walsh style.|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


nt||at|Anyway, whether East bids 1NT or 1@H, West's 2@D is correct 
- it shows a minimum hand with long diamonds and not much else, Which is exactly what she has.  
East should just pass 2@D.     Imagine if the @DK were offside.   
East should have about a king or so more for that 2NT bid, in other words, a hand that's too good for 1NT.  
West's 2@D bid shows a very weak hand.  
If E/W use "preemptive" jump-shifts, then W would be justified in bidding 2@D over 1@C.

Neither E nor W bid the suit, so chances are that N has spade length, if not strength.  
South led the @C10, and there is good reason not to lead that suit.  
The lead is not going to set up very many tricks, and the suit was bid by EAST,

2@D sounds like a weak bid, and I would have given some thought to 1NT.
BILAsst10: Could S redouble?
mitche:  I do not particularly like XX here, because the hand is not really that good. 
It has 1 1/2 defensive tricks to be sure, but it's completely flat.

Often, there is no right bid, only a "best" bid.    Here 2@D or 1NT could be right.   
My rule of thumb is to open 1NT whenever I have a hand in the NT range and shape. 
Even with 5 card major.|

at|mitche: Bidding:  E/W clearly would like to be in spades, but how to get there? 
Most people treat 2@S in this auction (instead of 2NT) as showing 4 card support.. 
The chances that West has a penalty double of 2@H are pretty low. 
(if W does have enough hearts for a penalty X she probably has enough to OPEN 1@H)  
So yes, the answer is to use the X for something else 
And what most people find useful is to show a 3-card support with it.|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Here is how the support X works:
Opener bids 1 of a suit, and responder bids at the 1 level, e.g. 1@C - 1@S.
4th seat (advancer) overcalls 2 of something or makes a take-out X.
With a 3-card support for RESPONDER's suit, OPENER doubles (or redoubles) to say: 
"I have a 3-card support for your suit."|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


nt||at|You have to agree on a bunch of stuff 
-- for example, do you always show  support whenever you have it?  
Or is opener free to make a more descriptive bid, e.g. 2NT when that looks  right?  
If you play support X, my guideline is to use it whenever you can.|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  In other words, if responder bids 1@S and opener doesn't make a support X, 
he denies a 3-card spade support...Period.|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


at| 
And then bidding 2@S would guarantee a 4-card support in this auction: 
1@C - 1@S - (2@H) - 2@S.  
I have that agreement with all of my partners with whom I use support X 
(and that is all of my expert partners).|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


nt||at|If west makes a support X, then at this vulnerability, N can bid 3@H 
I trust partner to have a pretty good hand for the 2@H bid. 
Why should S have a good hand? 
When N first passes, at this vulnerability, south coming into a "live" E/W auction is pretty dangerous.
So S has to have some good excuse for the bid 
-- a good hand is that excuse.. and also, a good suit!|
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


nt||at|amcs:  Can south bid 2@H with only 5?
mithe:  If S bid 2@H on a 5 card suit, it would have to be better .. at least QJ10xx and preferably KJ10xx.  
Remember that partner is going to lead the suit if she can.

at|mitche: Bidding:  Let's look at West's hand:  It is a pretty good hand, but it has 7 losers.  
East passed originally and then bid 2@S in competition.  East's hand is 8 or possibly even 9 losers.  Right?  
So 7+8 = 15, which is safe at the 3 level, not the 4 level.  
W should pass 2@S or bid 3@S if she is forced to and that is if East has a good raise to 2@S.|
pg| ***** 112 ***** |


nt||at|kat827:  If you were evaluating W's hand using Bergen point count, what would you give to it?
mitche:  I find it useful to use both Bergen points AND LTC, because they complement each other.. 
when LTC is 15 and I have a balanced hand (6322 is balanced) I go slowly.  
Now, how good is the W hand in Bergen points?|
pg| ***** 113 ***** |


nt||at|11 HCP + 1 for the 2 doubletons + 2 more for the spade length = 16 Bergen points, 
maybe 17 if you count the spades as a quality suit.
But W still has to wonder how 4 of his losers are going to go away.

pg| ***** 124 ***** |


at|
Yes it is, but here, when the @CK holds, there is no doubt in S where the @CA must be.
One point on defense here.  To be sure, N wants to lead hearts, but it might be best to play the @CK at trick 1, 
and then to shift to hearts.  
This way, there is no question in South's mind that the setting trick is coming from clubs, not hearts.|

at|mitche:  Bidding:  S has a "Bergen 20" opening bid (or a "mitch 22",  if you prefer),  
and S should open @1C.  
The advantage of getting the first bid in is significant.   
But be that as it may,  when E bid 1NT and W pulled to 2@C, she said she has a weak, unbalanced hand.  
Perhaps W was 4-5 in diamonds and clubs.   I think East’s 1NT was correct.  The hand is balanced, and we prefer NT to minor suit contracts when we have a choice, 
but East should still bid 2NT -- not pass the 2@C bid.|
pg| ***** 130 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Now - should N bid 3@S after the double?   After all, she has 9 HCP and a 5 card suit?  
When partner BALANCES  (as compared with a direct double),  you need to subtract 4 points or so from your hand.   
Your partner "borrowed" those 4 points to make his double.  
Think of it this way - a balancing double might be an ace -or more- lighter than a direct X.  
So no, N should not bid 3@S on this hand.

up|40|pf|y|at|mitche: Play:  I think if East passed 2@C, she should lead a LOW diamond and not the Jack.   
Anyway, after the @D lead, the declarer and the defenders both played well.
