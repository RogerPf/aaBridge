(If you're not sure about your settings log into your BBO windows version then:  
click the yellow tool at bottom and under the "general" tab check "widescreen" and save)
This will prevent the "cutting off" of the bottom parts or scrambling of your text in these presentations.

If you downloaded BBO recently, you will not be able to get online with the windows version...
You can still change or check your settings: 
Go to your C disc, and under "programs" find the Bridge Base Online folder
Open it and find the "profiles" folder
Open and scroll to find: BBO_Default_Settings 
line 71 should read: WIDE_CLIENT=1

fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch is a computer scientist, adjunct faculty member at UMBC (in the Computer Science department), 
and active bridge player. 
Mitch lives in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore with his wife Sue, cats and aquaria.

Mitch learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament bridge for graduate school, 
career and marriage.

Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player

When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

"Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: to acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."
Mitch Edelman aka mitche 



MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.
Thank you Eileen (wyoming33) for sending the hands and editing the chatlog! @h

at|mitche:  Bidding:
a) North has a reasonable minimum opening bid of 1@d, with 2 quick tricks and the majors.
b) 2@c is a bit light, since the East hand has, in effect,  8 points 
(the @SJ won't help unless pard has some good spade values, so don't count it).  
And 8 HCP with a kind of ratty 6 card suit is asking for trouble.|
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt||at|Change the @SJ to the @CJ and you're still too light for the bid.  A minimum 2@C overcall would be something like 
@sx, @hKxx,@h xxx,@c AQ10xxx - and even this is very thin.
Over 2@C, South has not got enough to call just yet, so pass was a good idea. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  West's 4@c bid is either a misclick or a pretty big overbid. I would have bid 2NT with West cards.  
I have a fitting @C-card and position wise the @DAQ are nice -- 
the opening leader cannot go after @D's profitably from her side.

After 2NT, East would do well to pass.  But in the auction we had, bidding 5@C is still too much.  
East may like the bid, but her hand has 8 losers.  
If W had enough stuff to make game, he would have bid more strongly than to invite it. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||
at|WestElsdon:  If East had passed, what should I have bid?
mitche: West might bid 2NT (my preference) to describe his hand, and then East would either pass or bid 3@c. 
If East passed, you (south) would, too.

at|mitche: Play: in 5@c.. 
Declarer may as well play the @DQ at trick 1. You played for S to have that card anyway.   
Next, when you led a trump from dummy at trick 2, the @CQ popped up. 
May as well use the Ace to catch the high honor. That way you assure yourself of just 1 trump loser.

sk||
at|mitche: Bidding:  I guess 3@c is OK at this vulnerability.  
If you are lucky, you will not get doubled and go down more than 500. 
3@h is an overbid here for 2 reasons:  
First, your hand is pretty balanced - you have a fair - not great heart suit, and no aces, and just 9 points. 
And second, you are vulnerable against nonvul opponents.  
Give West one of your partner's aces and you could be hurt badly.  
You should have a hand worth very nearly a full opener (with distribution) to come in vul at the 3-level.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt||at|WestElsdon:  If W had that extra A, wouldn't he bid? 
mitche: maybe.. but South is bidding in front of West, and double can be very effective, you know.
North had an easy 4@h bid. In all honesty, if my partner bid 3@H, I would be thinking about slam.
BILAsst10: recommended bidding?
mitche: 3@c, pass, pass, double, pass, 4@h.

at|mitche: Play: I think declarer must play a heart honor and finesse in trumps.  
If the trumps are 4-1 that is the only way to hold your losers to 1.
(and you do expect longer hearts with west due to east's preempt)|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt||at|I guess the lead of the @CA makes sense.  Pard bid the suit at the 3 level.  
But I would play the @C2 at trick 2 - leading a spade works only if your partner can ruff 
- which is not completely impossible, since you see 10 spades between  your hand and dummy.

SK||

at|mitche: Bidding:  South made a BALANCING 1@h bid.     Balancing here can be on a quite weak hand, 
since the odds are pretty good that North has some strength.  
So North should figure that his partner is bidding on some of North's points.
The balancing 1@h after South had previously passed is not a very strong bid.  
So North has not got a good enough hand to invite game. |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: If North wanted to invite game, there is a better idea than 3@h, and that would be 2@d.
sblitz:  Does that show @h support?
mitche: A cue bid here nominally shows a limit raise or better in hearts (balancer's suit) - so yes.
One deterrent in bidding 3@h is the flat hand.  
A key point in bidding:  the poorer your distribution, i.e. the closer you are to 4333 shape, 
the more high card strength you need to take tricks.

at|mitch:  Play: If you lead A from AK, then W should probably lead the @SK and then the @SA 
and then shift to something-- and the only logical something is the @C suit. 
Why?  |
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


at|
If partner's signaling is reliable, she played low spades and low spades,  so she discouraged spades the first 
time the suit was led. (She should play the 9, followed by the 2.)|

One of these days we will do a lesson on leads and third-hand play.   
Or you can read Kantar's excellent book(s) on defense. |
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


nt||
at|Mitche:  Back to play: 
When South got a diamond at trick 3, he counted his losers (3 spades and 2 clubs) 
and had to find a way to eliminate one of them. 
The @DAQ are sitting in dummy, and declarer has just 1 @D left. 
That should lead him to play 3 rounds of trumps, and then 2 more rounds of @D to discard a club loser. 
Since he has the @SJ10 left, he can set one of them up - the danger is to lose 2 clubs.

at|mitche: Bidding:
West has a pretty decent hand, worth 19 HCP and with a very nice 5-card @H suit.  
The hand's good enough that I would bid 3@c, not 2, to clue East in to the fact that we belong in game 
opposite even a minimum 1@S bid.   2@c shows some extra strength but not as much as West has.

BILAsst10: Could West open 2@C? |
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: No.  West has a 4 loser hand, to be sure, but would not want to play at the 3-level opposite, say, 
@sQJxx,@h xx,@d xxx,@c xxxx.   If hearts are 4-2 then 3@h would go down opposite that dummy :( 
I understand the 4 and 4 idea   (MM: 4 Losers/4 QT criteria for bidding 2@C)
but I am still looking for playing tricks.  And it's 4 1/2 losers. 
BILAsst10:  One won't always get the perfect dummy.
mitche: Right... nor will you always get the perfectly cruddy dummy.. Unless I am your pard :).
The 2@c opening is still GF|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche: and so East bids 2NT, a very reasonable idea.
Someone wondered if East had enough for 2NT.. maybe not.. but the alternative is 3@c, 
showing about 9 points or so.  
Remember that West bid 2@C, which should show some extra values (with a minimum hand, West rebids 1NT).  
So East can expect 14+ points, possibly as much as 17.  Vulnerable, you want to stretch to get to game.  
West would be happy to bid 3NT with a maximum.

at|mitche: Bidding: At IMPS, I think East should pass this hand.
South might bid 1@D in third seat, even vulnerable, especially if your style is to have full openers in first seat.  
If you open light in first seat, then passing the S hand in third seat is certainly reasonable.
West has 10 HCP and a good heart suit.  
In 3rd seat, West might open 1@h.  But here in 4th seat, pass is correct. 
Why? |
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


nt||at|Well, how many spades does West have?
BILAsst10: 2 - So ops may have spade fit?
mitche: Exactly - the rule of 15 (add HCP + S) should apply.  
If W opens 1@h, he may get outbid in spades. 
On balance, it's better to pass west's hand in 4th seat. |
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


nt||at| 
Occasionally you miss a 3@h partial, but more often, you wind up pushing the opps to a making 2@s contract.
BILAsst10: If south opens 1@D then West can bid 1@H?
mitche: Yes, absolutely

at|mitche: Bidding:  The third seat 1@s and 2@s bids were probably OK (we will get the other bids in a moment)
but 3@s was not a very good idea at all. If S had any values, she could have bid them over 3@d
And passing 3@d would have let E/W play their ice-cold slam in a part-score.
ELIZA42: Didn't want to give up
mitche:  OK,  you didn't want to give up.  It cost you 800, when you would have got out for -190. 
I admire your courage -- but not your discretion
ELIZA42: I didn't open 4@s. |
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  OK, so North's bidding wasn't completely off the deep end... she didn't open 4@s :),  
but after 2@s,  you should get the message that your partner has nothing. So N/S are outgunned.   
And the hardest part of competitive bidding is knowing when it's time to let the opponents win the bid. 
Let's get the E/W bidding under the microscope now.|
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


nt||
at|Certainly East has the biggest hand of the night.  
And she shows it by doubling the first round (planning to do more bidding later).
West has a near-bust;  I think West is best bidding 2@C (only 4-card suit)
veeree:  Not NT?  Shows @s stopper
mitche: 1NT should show about 7 - 8 points (maybe a bad 9). 
Thing is, you cannot count on east having a mammoth hand after the X. 
So East has a mammoth hand and over 2@s, I'd bid more than a simple 3@d|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


nt||at|tutootsie: What would you bid? 
mitche: maybe 4NT, asking pard to bid 6 with the top of his 1NT bid.
West's 1NT promises spade control
tutootsie:  Go to NT without @s? 
mitche: What was West's bid?
tutootsie: I know but that singleton K scared me.
mitche:  West bid NT, so should have @S stop.|
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


nt||
at|tutootsie:  Really?   When I forced her to bid?
mitche: Yes, 1NT absolutely promises a spade stopper.  
Even if the spade stop were just QJx, you have the suit under control.  
West might have bid 2@c.
tutootsie: I still thought my 3@D was forcing|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: The problem with east cue-bidding spades in this auction is that West described his hand as 
7-9, balanced, spade stopper(s).  
And cue bidding 3@s would get a 3NT bid (or possibly 4@c) - but West should have bid 2@c to begin with.|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  And over a hypothetical 3@s bid by East 
p-p-1@s-X/p-2c-2@s-3@s/p-3NT-p-Ace ask to 6@c)
West would now bid 3NT, a natural bid, showing a stop.
tutootsie: Well my bad, I didn't know how to force.  And I can only count 10 tricks don't see slam
mitche: I don't expect E/W to get to 6@d or 6@c (both of them make, by the way). 
But 5@d is a very decent contract.|

nt||at|Suppose the opening lead is a spade. 
Win the @SK and knock out the @CA, making sure to keep the @C2.
Then the club suit provides an entry to dummy. 
Win the @SA and finesse in hearts.
6NT is making. |

at|So to summarize my flaying this poor, deceased horse:
East doubles 1@s, and W bids 2@c. N might bid 2@s, and E bids 3@s,
W bids 3NT, East can ask for aces, and finding W with 1 of them bids 6@c
After North bid and rebid vulnerable, the odds are high that she owns the @HK.

at|mitche: Bidding:  
After 2@s, North should bid 3@d.
North should not pass 2@s, and 3@d looks like a good idea. 
What does North need for game? 3 spades to the queen and either the @HA or @hKQ
In bridge, better late than never doesn't apply. Better sooner than later!!!
Back to the bidding -
After 2@S pass, pass (our actual auction), I would bid 3@h, not 3@c. |
pg| ***** 105 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  West could have an undisclosed heart fit, and East's hand is too good to make a non-forcing 3@c bid
I don't know if I'd bid 5@c with West hand.  
East's auction certainly suggests a sacrifice, but @sAxxx of trumps means that N/S may have some problems.
If West's trumps were as good as @sA109x, I would have passed 4@s and taken my chances defending.
So West has a hard problem.. the 5@c bid was "taking out insurance" and rates to be a cheap sacrifice 
(probably no worse than down 1 or 2), given East's great length in clubs.|
pg| ***** 106 ***** |


nt||
at|mitche:  And now we see why 3@d by N at her first turn would have been a winner.
South would know that N/S have a double fit in the pointed suits.  
So N/S hands are better suited for offense (declaring) than defending.
As it is, 5@s is down 1. 
Sample auction: 
p-1@S-2@C-2@S/p-3@d-3@h-p/4@h-p-p-4@S/p-p-5@h and then 5@s.
