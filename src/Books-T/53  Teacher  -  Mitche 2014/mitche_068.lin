(rightclick on your desktop,select "personalize" "screen defenitions")
Also, make sure you have "widescreen" checked in your windows BBO-version
(If you're not sure about your settings log into your BBO windows version then:  
click the yellow tool at bottom and under the "general" tab check "widescreen" and save)
This will prevent the "cutting off" of the bottom parts or scrambling of your text in these presentations.

If you downloaded BBO recently, you will not be able to get online with the windows version...
You can still change or check your settings: 
Go to your C disc, and under "programs" find the Bridge Base Online folder
Open it and find the "profiles" folder
Open and scroll to find: BBO_Default_Settings 
line 71 should read: WIDE_CLIENT=1

fp|3|cp|2|cs|1|ht|c|3d|3|at|{^f Mitch Edelman, aka MITCHE  }|
fp||cp|2|cs|3|ht|e|at|
^b@2Mitch (now happily retired) is a computer scientist and was an adjunct faculty member at UMBC 
(in the Computer Science department). 
Mitch and his his wife Sue live in Finksburg, Md, a suburb of Baltimore, together with 3 (spoiled) recue cats 
and aquaria.
Mitch is an avid amateur photographer, whose shots have appeared in a number of books of poetry.
Sue loves pottering with the plants in the backyard.

Mitch is also an active bridge player who learned bridge while in college and took a 20 year break from tournament
bridge for graduate school, career and marriage.

Mitch joined the BIL's Mentoring Team February 24, 2010 – Play and Discuss 2/1 
most suited to the improving/upper intermediate player.

mitche:
"When a bridge player starts to get serious about improving his/her game, s/he discovers an exciting 
and challenging world of bidding systems, conventions and techniques.

Intuition and card-sense provide a floor for our level of bridge expertise. Improving our proficiency at bridge 
takes practice and study. 
They say that "practice makes perfect", but that is only half the story.

Perfect Practice makes for perfect performance, and in our 2/1 bid, play and discuss" sessions, 
we will transform practice into perfect practice.

We will use the popular 2 over 1 standard bidding system, probably the most widely-used system in North 
America, if not the world. We will cover those conventions and treatments most commonly used by tournament 
players. We will also discuss play from declarer's and defenders' perspective.|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


nt||cp|2|at|^b@2

We will cover the 2/1 system and the thinking that goes into bidding and play. My goal is to improve your 
technical skills in a friendly environment, so that you can hold your own at the table, be it on BBO or in a 
club or tournament game.

I will assume that you have learned sayc, have played a bit, are interested in improving and seriously 
committed to enjoying yourself too.

The objectives: "To acquire bidding judgment and avoiding common mistakes in play."

Mitch Edelman aka mitche 



MM: In "real time" bidding was discussed after the play.
In this presentation it will be discussed right after the bidding.
Thank you Eileen (wyoming33) for sending the hands and editing the chatlog! @h

at|mitche: Bidding:   It's hard to knock success... But this auction gives me some issues.
Imagine that South has hearts.  Then they have lost the suit.
Although the North hand has just 4 losers, it also has a couple of possible places to play the contract. 
So I would start with 1@c, not 2@c.  I would plan to reverse into hearts (which is forcing, right?).
And then, depending on how the auction proceeds, I will get to 6@C or 6@h or here, 6NT from South is 100% on ice.
So that is the first thing. I want to keep my options open where to play this powerful hand.
|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Second, South's heart holding is kind of weak, right?
Here is Mitch's rule on using Blackwood (and Eddie Kantar's and pretty nearly everyone's): 
DONT launch into BW with 2 losers in an unbid side suit. 
South has a bit of a problem after 3@C.. I think the best bid is 4@c. 
Why? 
North has advertised a pretty good club suit. So I want to raise. Yes, South has just Jxx, 
|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  But consider the alternatives:   
3@d is second negative;
4@d just complicates life; 
3@s? need a 4th spade.
After the raise, North will bid 4@d (cue bid), and South will bid 4@s.
When North knows that there is a spade control, he can rebid 5@D (first/second round 
control of diamonds AND a heart control).
|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  You can just bash into 6@C and hope that it works... Or you can try to find out.
GG_Bridge: Why does the 5@D bid show a heart control? 
mitche: 4@S by South would deny a heart control. Yes?
So when North bids past 5@c, he says "I am not concerned about 2 fast heart losers."

at|mitche: Play: East has a more or less blind lead.  
When the other guys just blast into slam, it's time to look for 2 fast winners.  
Because given time, they will probably be able to set up 12 tricks.
So I like the aggressive @S lead. If it surrenders an overtrick, too bad (at IMPS, that is just 1 IMP), 
but if it catches partner with a cashing trick, you gain a bunch of IMPS.
Other than that, not much to say...Except, West should not duck both the first and second heart.
|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  If North has Kxx, for example, he will never win it.
Maybe East would win a late spade trick instead, if North has @HKxx...

SK||

at|mitche: Bidding:  I guess the double of 3@h was intended as negative, and South thought it was business.
I think that most pairs use neg X only through 2@s.  Some pairs play them thru 4@h (or 4@d, maybe).
imaquila:  Yes figured that out pretty quick.   How does one know which to interpret?
mitche: The important thing is that you and your partner are on the same page. 
Otherwise, you will be writing a lot of -730's on your scorecard.
veeree:  At 4-level it is penalty?
|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: If you have no agreement, you are operating in the dark. 
I would just assume the negative X thru 2@s.
I like to be able to penalize pre-emptive jump shifts, so I play double of 3@h here would be business, 
or maybe if you agree, "card-showing." 
If North is not using the negative X at this level, a free bid of 3@s would be fine. 
veeree:  With 4 cards?
|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: If South cannot stand spades, he may have a @h-stopper and can bid 3NT, else he goes back to 4@C 
with club length.     Pre-empts can be very nasty to cope with. 
Here N/S would get lucky, because they are on ice for 4@S.
As for showing 5 spades. North has been put under pressure.  
|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  If North passes, so will South.     4@c or 4@d are guesses.. 
I sympathize with the guy who has to bid over 3@h on that hand. 
Wonder what you would do as South with a 4@d bid by North? 
MM: Under pressure bid 4@s? :)

|sk||

at|mitche: Bidding:  I admire West's courage. But bravery is not quite enough.
There are some agreements for bidding with a cruddy 5-5 in the majors 
- but here, E/W are probably not using any of them.
After 3@D, vulnerable, West's bid of 4@S is a losing proposition.
If West bids over 3@d then 3@s is probably enough. 
E/W can take 8 tricks, and that's it. 3@s down 1 is not a disaster, but 4@s down 2 is! 
|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


nt||at|GG_Bridge: Should West have passed after the 1NT bid?
mitche: I think that West should bid 2@c (sort of a Garbage Stayman) and over 2@d, bid 2@h.
The NT bidder will then pass or correct to 2@S. 
(MM: In sayc that would be showing an invitational hand with 5 hearts and 4 spades
And would you want opener to accept the invitation?
Transfer to your best 5-card and pass is another option)

at|mitche: Bidding:  I am not a fan of control-showing responses to 2@c, 
because they frequently allow lead-directing doubles and for the opps to find pre-emptive bids. 
That said, the 2@s bid tells South that the @CA is with North and slam is probable.
Which slam?      Well, over 3@d, North must show her heart suit.
If N/S get the hearts going then they reach 6@H, or maybe 7@h, which doesn't need anything more than a 3-2 @H split, 
and no void.

at|mitche: Bidding:  With this 1-4-4-4 pattern and the @SQueen, South might as well bid 1NT and not 2@c.
Why? 
A) 1NT limits the hand's strength. N/S got to a 22 point 3NT on momentum, and 
B) 2@C suggests 5-4 shape here, not 1444
Over 2@C, What should North do?
|
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Well, if South is 5/4,  certainly pass is a possibility, and 2@d is, too.  
As 2@C bidder could have as much as a bad 17 HCP, I would bid 2@d to keep the auction alive.
(3@c is highly invitational)
But since I bid 1NT, and not 2@c, I don't have to worry about being in a 4-3 @D fit.|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


nt||at|Cliff228: With 7 pts, if South has 17, game is still not possible?
mitche: Well, 24 points might be enough.. if South has, for example,    @sQ, @hK8x, @dAQJxx, @cAJxx 
then game is not impossible    (cruddy, but not out of the question).  
Maybe a better 17 would be @sx, @HK9x, @dAKJxx, @cAQxx.

at|mitche: Play:  I think the heart lead is OK .. nothing else appeals.. With spades bid by opener's LHO, 
it's not a great idea to lead the suit. 
East continues hearts, and at trick 3, West played a third heart. Declarer cashed his last heart winner at trick 4.
So, What can East deduce from the bidding and early play?
East knows that South bid 1@D, then clubs and has 4 hearts. 
|
pg| ***** 99 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  The only way this makes sense is for South to be either 1=4=4=4 or 0=4=5=4,
but if declarer really were void in spades, he would not have bid 3NT.
So it is virtually certain that East knows at trick 5 the entire story.

at|mitche: Bidding:  I suggest that you use Bergen raises. Here, North would bid 3@C to show 4-card support 
and about 7-10 dummy points, exactly what she has.  
South will happily bid 4@h, knowing about the 10-card fit and 25 HCP, plus or minus HCP.

If you do not use Bergen raises, I recommend you learn them.
Now, in the actual auction, East bid 2@S over 2@h, 
|

nt||at|mitche:  I don't mind that bid terribly much (after all, East has a decent 7 card suit) --
You could make a case for 3@s too.  
I think that 2@s is a better idea, since East does have a defensive card, the @CKing.  
Over 2@S, South bid 3@c. Is that intended to be a help suit?
I think that South should just bid 4@h directly. 
btour:  Why, yes intended as help.  I am looking at 6 losers
|
pg| ***** 107 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  South is trading on keeping the opponents in the dark on where his strength is, 
versus scientifically pinpointing where the defense should be looking to attack.
btour:  Why should I go to 4 after only 2@h response? :)
msphola:  20 Bergen pts?
mitche: I know you have 6 loser hand and North could have 9 losers, 
but you also have a very decent 6 bagger and 3 aces... that is why I tend to get aggressive.
|
pg| ***** 108 ***** |


nt||at|mitche:  Another way is to count Bergen points, as was suggested. 
Your 6th heart is 2 points, and your 2 doubletons, another one that brings you to 19 and your quality @H suit - 
adds the 20th point.
That is why I want to bid 4@h, not to get too fine. 

|
pg| ***** 109 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: North didn't bid 3 originally, she bid 2@h which could be a 10 loser hand.   
That is why I think you should use a Bergen raise.  
Bergen 3@C should be a good 9 or 8 loser hand.
I want to discuss 3@d.
calligal: Do we have to?|
pg| ***** 110 ***** |


nt||at|mitche: When East bids 2@S in a "live" auction, where S's hand is unlimited, do NOT bid 
3@D unless you have an express agreement that your suit bid shows tolerance for the spades.
If you bid over 3@c, bid 3@s, not 3@d.  And I would bid 3@s.

at|mitche: Play:  The 3@d bid should tell declarer where the @DK is located, so at trick 2, lead 
a @D to dummy (finessing the queen) and then lead a heart from dummy. 
With 10 hearts missing the @hKing, even with the spade bid, I would plan on finessing. 
If I lost to a singleton offside @sKing, that's just bad luck.  But the percentage play is the @H finesse.
When the King shows up, you can play a club to the Jack and cash the @CAce to luckily drop 
the doubleton @CK and take 12 tricks (:))

nt||at|mitche:  Do I want to be in slam?   No, it depends on 2 finesses and a lucky club lie. 

OK, thanks to Eileen for her generous assistance and to all of you for your courteous 
attention and great questions tonite. 

MM: You can play the hand Double Dummy if you wish
