^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 333 - January 27, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
This week's deal is one of those rare masterpieces in which the winning play for the declarer is far from obvious with all 4 hands in view, yet it would be possible for a great player to find the path to success at the table. It turned out that the actual declarer was a great player - ^*BMichel Lebel^*N of France (a former World Champion).

This week's deal took place about 3 years ago in an exhibition match where Lebel was playing with ^*BMichel Perron^*N (another of France's all-time greats). ^*BSociété Générale^*N (a French bank) sponsored a series of these matches in which the French National Team faced various local teams in an effort to help promote bridge in various parts of that country. 

This particular match was against a team from Bordeaux that included ^*BPatrice Piganeau^*N who reported this beautiful deal to me. Apparently Société Générale did a fine job in promoting this match as there were over 700(!) people watching vugraph at the playing site. The audience got to see an example of bridge at its best when this week's deal was played.

This deal has been rotated to make South the declarer.

I will be going to Japan on February 1 to play in the ^*BNEC International Bridge Festival^*N. I am very much looking forward to this trip for a couple of reasons. First, the very first international tournament that I ever played in was in Japan in 1984 and I really enjoy visiting that fascinating country. Second, the NEC tournament has earned a reputation for being one of the toughest and best run bridge tournaments in the world. Rumor has it that the tournament organizers treat the visiting players very well (which is not a surprise given the treatment that I received when I played in Japan in 1984).

I am also pleased to report that the quarter-finals, semi-finals, and finals of the main team event at the NEC tournament (the ^*BNEC Cup^*N) will be presented as a live vugraph broadcast through ^*BBridge Base Online^*N on February 7th and 8th. I do not know the exact starting times of each session right now, but I am hopeful that this information will appear in the next ^*BDeal of the Week^*N. Starting times will also be posted in the lobby area of ^*BBridge Base Online^*N as soon as the information is known.

The software that you will need to install ^*BBridge Base Online^*N on your PC is available as a ^*Bfree^*N download through the following web site. Click on the blue rectangle below to be taken directly to this web site in a new browser window.

West overcalled 2@D which, as is common in France, was an artificial bid showing at least 5-5 in the majors. Most North American experts would bid 2@C (a Michaels cuebid) instead of 2@D with such a hand, but the French prefer to use the 2@C cuebid of a 1@C opening as natural.|

ls|sc|mb|2S|an|Some kind of cuebid|
nt|I am not sure exactly what ^*BMichel Perron^*N, North, meant with his 2@S bid. Apparently 2@S was some kind of a cuebid, but when you see his hand (it will become the dummy), you will see that Perron did not have much of a fit for his partner's club suit. |

nt|One of the things I really like about this deal is how well Lebel timed the hand to ruff exactly the right number of hearts (one) in his hand. It turned out that he eventually forced West to allow him to ruff a second heart and this had the effect of removing the last heart from East's hand, |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|wh|ls|eh|pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|hk|pc|ct|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


hs|wh|hs|nh|at|thereby isolating the heart guard in the West hand (which was necessary for the squeeze to operate). |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|If Lebel had ruffed a second heart before throwing West on lead, then West would have been in a position to remove the dummy's last heart. If he had not ruffed any hearts at all, then East would have been left with a heart guard in the ending. In either case there would have been no squeeze and Lebel's contract would have failed. |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


ls|wh|ls|nh|up|35|
nt|This is certainly one of the nicest played hands that I have seen recently. Not to take anything away from Lebel's great effort, but did you notice that he gave the defense a chance to defeat his slam? This is not to suggest that the winning defense is realistic, but I think you will agree that it is interesting nonetheless!|
