^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 337 - February 24, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played by my friend ^*BLars Andersson^*N, one of Sweden's leading players.

During the next week there is going to be a lot of live vugraph broadcasts through ^*BBridge Base Online^*N. 10 matches from the the ^*BTony Memorial Cup^*N tournament will be broadcast live from Taiwan over the period of February 27 to March 2. In addition, the complete semi-finals and finals of the ^*BDanish Teams Championship^*N will be broadcast live from Denmark on March 1st and 2nd.

The Danish broadcast is especially ambitious as live action will be simultaneously presented from all the tables in this event (4 on March 1 and 2 on March 2). We have never broadcast from more than one table at a time before. Session starting times for all of these broadcasts can be found at:

pg| ***** 7 ***** |


hs|sc|hs|nd|nt|The defenders had made it impossible for Lars to ruff all 3 of his club losers in the dummy. At first glance it appeared that Lars would need the club finesse (or to ruff out the @CK) in order to make his contract. Lars had 2 reasons to believe that neither of these lines would succeed: West's double of the final contract and the fact that West had selected a trump as his opening lead.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


ls|nd|hs|nh|nt|Both West's double and his trump opening lead suggested that he had been dealt strong holdings in both of the unbid suits. In this case Lars' only chance was to arrange for some kind of heart-club squeeze against West. That is easier said than done, especially if East was dealt a stopper in hearts. Can you see how Lars was able to reach a successful squeeze ending?|
