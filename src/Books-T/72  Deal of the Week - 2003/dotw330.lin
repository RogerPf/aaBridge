^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 330 - January 6, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }

Last week's deal featured ^*BGIB^*N as declarer. ^*BGIB^*N is the best computer program ever written for playing random bridge deals. In this week's deal, ^*BGIB^*N was also the declarer. I have shown this play problem to several (human) experts. So far none of my friends have come up with the correct solution, but it did not take ^*BGIB^*N long to find the best line of play.

^*BGIB^*N was written by ^*BMatt Ginsberg^*N, a professor of computer science at the University of Oregon as well as a fine bridge player. Matt's goal for ^*BGIB^*N is nothing less than world bridge supremacy. Judging from its performance on this week's deal, it is easy to imagine that eventually Matt will be successful. Although ^*BGIB^*N still makes silly mistakes on occasion (just like any other bridge player), it continues to improve at a rapid pace. The day in when a computer program wins a World Championship at bridge may not be that far away.

I found this week's deal especially interesting. The solution to this problem is not very difficult in a technical sense, but it seems that human bridge experts suffer from a blind spot in this deal that prevents them from seeing the light. One of ^*BGIB's^*N strengths is that it does not have any blind spots of this sort.

The original Culbertson-Lenz Match brought bridge to the front pages of the world's newspapers for several days. Arguably no other event has done more to contribute to the popularity of our game. The ^*BACBL^*N should be commended for trying to recapture some of the magic of the original Culbertson-Lenz Match in the form of this exhibition match. I would personally like to thank the management of the ^*BACBL^*N for their interest in broadcasting this match through ^*BBridge Base Online^*N.

The ^*BACBL^*N has also asked our company to start producing live vugraph broadcasts of their major National events, starting at the upcoming ^*BSpring North American Championships^*N this March in Philadelphia. We are committed to keeping ^*BBridge Base Online^*N and access to these live broadcasts completely free and we will do our best to serve the world's bridge players with our live coverage of future events.

at|West's opening lead was the @SQ. Think about you would play this hand as the declarer before reading on. |

hs|nc|hs|sc|nt|So far all of the human bridge experts that I have shown this problem to have concluded that against best defense a 3-2 club break is required to make 3NT. |

hs|sc|at|all that is left is to try running the clubs. If that suit breaks 3-2 then the contract will succeed. Otherwise, there is very little chance to come to 9 tricks. |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


hs|nc|up|11|nt|It should not come as a surprise for you to learn that clubs were indeed 4-1 when ^*BGIB^*N played this deal. Can you think of any way to handle any of the possible 4-1 club splits without having to risk your contract when clubs turn out to be 3-2 after all? |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |

at|Can you see what ^*BGIB^*N was "thinking" about when it made this unusual play in hearts? |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sc|nt|^*BGIB^*N was always planning on playing on clubs, but it found a slight advantage in starting that suit by leading the @CQ from the dummy (instead of starting with the @CK from the closed hand). |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|
pc|CQ|hs|ec|sk||at|^*BGIB^*N gave itself the extra chance that East might have been dealt a singleton @CA. In this case East would have to win the trick. |

ls|sc|ls|wc|hs|es|hs|ss|nt|The best the defense could do from here was to lead a second round of spades. ^*BGIB^*N was able to win this trick in its hand |

hs|sc|hs|ec|at|and then continued clubs from the top to drive out the @CA. In this case, ^*BGIB's^*N line would have transformed into the same line that most humans seem to favor. |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


ls|ec|hs|nc|up|8|md|0,c4,,,d4|nt|Why is it that so many human players have trouble solving this problem? I think it is because even the best human players are largely creatures of habit. When we see a club suit like the one that existed on this deal and so few entries to the hand with the long clubs, it seems obvious to lay down the @CK - a play that would be right on many similar deals. |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


nt|It is interesting to note that if we change the club suit in this deal |

pg| ***** 31 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|nh|hs|Sh|at|it would be likely that almost all experts would now find the right play of crossing to the dummy in hearts |

nt|The club suit shown above (which I think most experts would play correctly) |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


md|0ct,c4,cq|at|is, at least as far as this deal is concerned, functionally identical to the club suit that was part of the deal that ^*BGIB^*N played better than several of my bridge expert friends. |
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


up|7|nt|Blind spots (like this one) that the best human players suffer from may eventually lead to our downfall at the hands of computer programs like ^*BGIB^*N! If you fear that day, just think about how much we can learn about bridge from machines that "understand" this amazing game better than we do! |
