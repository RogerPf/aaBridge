^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 331 - January 13, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
If you ever get an e-mail from ^*BTom Carmichael^*N with "Interesting hand" as the subject line, you should not expect to be disappointed! That's exactly how I found out about this week's deal which Tom played last year in a Knockout Teams event.

Regulars at the ACBL Nationals may find this hard to believe, but Tom will be turning 29 years old soon (January 20th is his birthday). It seems like Tom has been a Junior player forever, but it has been a couple of years since Tom has been eligible to represent the United States in various World Junior Championships. The high point of Tom's career as a Junior came in 1999 when he was part of the American Team that won the Silver Medal at the World Junior Teams Championships in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

Tom has also made his mark as a player in various open events, including a win in the 1997 National IMP Pairs (a North American Championship event). Tom is not considered a Junior anymore, but he continues to be one of the most promising and successful young bridge players in North America. Tom brings more than just his bridge skills to the table. He is always a gentleman to both his partners and his opponents.

It is obvious when you play against Tom (or when you receive an e-mail from him with "Interesting hand") that he is very much in love with the game of bridge.

hs|nd|hs|sd|ls|nh|ls|sh|at|Given that Tom had lost 2 tricks already, the contract seemed to have no hope at all. Tom did not give up. Being a true student of the game, Tom was well aware of the fact that strange things can happen when you run a long suit. Something strange indeed did happen on the run of the diamonds.|

pg| ***** 24 ***** |


ls|wh|Hs|ws|at|Tom also expected West to have a strong holding in spades. When it turned out that West had been dealt the @SKJ10, there was no way that he could get out of his own way. |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|West discarded a spade on Tom's last diamond (a heart discard instead would have been immediately fatal as Tom would have continued with the @HA and another heart to establish an extra winner in the dummy in that suit). |
