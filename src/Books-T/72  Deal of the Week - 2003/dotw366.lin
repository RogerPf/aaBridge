I am pleased to announce the release of the latest educational CD-ROM based on software that was developed by my company. ^*IThe Jannersten Collection^*N was produced by ^*BLex de Groot^*N who runs the offices of ^*BBridge Base^*N in The Netherlands.

This software product is based on the material from 2 classics of bridge literature, ^*IFind the Mistakes^*N and ^*IThe Only Chance^*N. Both of these books were written by Sweden's ^*BEric Jannersten^*N, one of the greatest bridge writers and analysts in the history of our game.

^*IThe Jannersten Collection^*N consists of 75 deals from ^*IFind the Mistakes^*N and 83 deals from ^*IThe Only Chance^*N. The user is able to play these deals while the program defends and each deal is accompanied by a detailed analysis. The material in ^*IThe Jannersten Collection^*N is suitable for  strong intermediate to advanced players. The are ^*Bmany^*N beautiful bridge deals in this package and I suspect that regular readers of ^*BThe Deal of the Week^*N will really enjoy this product.

This week's deal was taken from ^*IFind the Mistakes^*N. In this book (and in the software version), you are presented with what looks to be a series of well played hands. Your mission is to figure out where the declarer went wrong and how he really should have played.

The basic format of ^*IThe Only Chance^*N is different. This book is essentially a collection of declarer play problems. What makes these problems special is that in each problem it appears at first glance that the contract has no hope at all. ^*BJannersten^*N challenges the reader to come up with a distribution of the defenders' cards and a line of play that will allow the contracts to be made.

The retail price of ^*IThe Jannersten Collection^*N is $39.95. For people who have bought this product, enjoyed it, and want more, we also sell a supplement to this program that includes 70 deals from ^*ICard Reading^*N, another classic by ^*BEric Jannersten^*N. The ^*ICard Reading^*N supplement to ^*IThe Jannersten Collection^*N retails for $14.95 (however, you must have intial CD ROM package running; ^*ICard Reading^*N cannot be purchased alone, it is only a supplement).|va|8|at|
