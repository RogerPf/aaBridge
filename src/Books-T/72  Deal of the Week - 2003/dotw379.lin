^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 379 - December 15, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
This week's deal was created last week by the deal generator of ^*BBridge Base Online^*N (^*BBBO^*N), the ^*Bfree^*N online bridge service that was developed by my company. Thanks to ^*BDean Strachan^*N for bringing this deal to my attention. Dean (^*Bdeanrover6^*N on ^*BBBO^*N) is an aspiring young player from England as well as a yellow member (volunteer administrator) on our site. Dean has also worked for our company as both a vugraph operator and in assisting us in the development of various educational CD-ROMs.

Yesterday was a record day on ^*BBBO^*N. At our peak time there were over 2650 people logged into our site. That's the most there have ever been if you don't count the times in which a ^*Blive^*N vugraph broadcast was going on (the vugraph record is over 5400). Nowadays there are at least 1000 people logged in to ^*BBBO^*N for close to 20 hours of every day and over 2000 people logged in for almost 6 hours every day.

Late January of 2003 was the first time we had over 500 people logged in to ^*BBBO^*N at once. These days there are never fewer than 500 people online. As 2003 progressed, it was a real thrill watching our numbers grow from fewer than 500 to more than 5000. I wonder what will happen in 2004...

You can join all of these crazy bridge players by downloading and installing the ^*BBBO^*N software through the following web site. ^*BBBO^*N is a 100% free service.

You don't have a very good hand, but your position at the table suggests that you are going to be the declarer. How did that happen? |
pg| ***** 1 ***** |


mb|1D|mb|D|mb|R|mb|1S|hs|ss|nt|Here's how: West dealt and opened 1@D, your partner made a takeout double, and East redoubled. You chose to bid 1@S as South (would you?). |
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


ls|ss|mb|3D|
at|West rebid 3@D which was described as a strong playing hand that was possibly light in terms of high cards. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |

at|You might have thought you were out of the woods, but your partner jumped to 4@S and East doubled (no surprise there). |

nt||ls|ss|pc|DK|
at|The opening lead was the @DK |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


pc|D8|pc|D4|pc|D3|at|to which East followed with the @D4. |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


pc|DQ|
hs|ns|at|West continued with the @DQ which you ruffed in dummy |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


ls|ns|pc|S6|pc|DA|pc|D5|at|as East played the @DA. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sc|at|The @DA being with East is a good news - West probably has the @CA. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|ns|hs|ssa|at|The bad news is that the bidding suggests that trumps are 4-0. Think about how you would continue as declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


sk||hs|es|nt|With respect to the possibility of trumps being 4-0 (strongly suggested by East's double), can it hurt you to find out if West has a spade by cashing a high trump at trick 3? As we will see this would hurt. One of the things that makes this deal difficult is that the declarer has to take an early position about the layout of the trump suit.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt|At first glance it appears that, if East has all 4 spades, the certain trump loser |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


ls|es|ls|ns|ls|ss|hs|nc|hs|sc|at|and 2 certain club losers (plus the trick that has already been lost) will make the contract hopeless. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|ns|at|4@S is in fact makable against the not unlikely layout of the East-West cards shown above. Precise timing is required and cashing a high trump early would be the end of the world (you will see why soon). |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sd|ls|ns|nt|The first necessary step is to cash ^*Bboth^*N of dummy's high hearts, discarding the last diamond from your hand on the 2nd round. |

pg| ***** 20 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|pc|C3|

hs|wc|at|At this point West has some choices about how he can defend, but none of his options result in 4 tricks for the defense. |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |

pg| ***** 23 ***** |


hs|wd|at|A diamond return would make things easy. |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


ls|wd|pc|dj|hs|nc|hs|es|at|You would be able to discard the dummy's club loser and East's @SJ would be the only remaining winner for the defense. You should now be able to see why it was necessary to cash both of dummy's high hearts for a diamond discard early in the play.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|es|hs|wc|up|1|nt|If, after winning the @CA, West defends passively and returns a club, |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |

pg| ***** 27 ***** |


ls|nc|pc|CK|pc|CJ|pc|C4|

pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|In the ending shown above, it is vital that there are 2 spades left in the South hand. |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |

pg| ***** 40 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|es|mc|9|at|East's @S8 would then represent the setting trick. |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|es|up|23|hs|wc|nt|If West had ducked his @CA, the eventual result would be an identical endplay against East. |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


up|17|ls|wc|

hs|wh|at|Furthermore, it would not have helped the defense for West to switch to a heart (rather than play a 2nd diamond) at trick 2. |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


ls|wh|pc|hj|hs|nh|nt|It is possible to arrive at an interesting end position in this variation (not that I am suggesting that the declarer should play as described). After winning West's heart shift in the dummy, |

pg| ***** 59 ***** |


ls|ns|pc|sa|hs|es|hs|ec|at|leaving East with no convenient discard. Being squeezed is never much fun, but it is particularly painful when one of the suits you are squeezed in is trump! |

hs|es|hs|ss|hs|ns|mc|10|at|In this 3-card ending, East is just as endplayed in trump as he was in the 4-card end position that we saw earlier. |
