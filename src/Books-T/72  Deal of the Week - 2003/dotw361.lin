|cs|4|at|^-{ ^*BSPECIAL!!!! There are 2 Deals of the Week this week!^*N }
^-
Both deals of the week this week involve redoubled contracts played by the partnership of ^*BDaniel Korbel^*N and ^*BSusie Harbor^*N on ^*BBridge Base Online^*N. Daniel and Susie are 2 of Canada's brightest Junior stars. Apparently they like to redouble so be careful when you play against them!

Expert commentary will provided in English and at least one other language.

pg| ***** 31 ***** |


lc|da|mb|d|
hs|sc|nt|Apparently West did not care (or did not realize) that his opponents were trying for slam in clubs. He doubled 5@C |

hs|nc|hs|sc|nt|
Daniel (correctly as it turned out) decided that West rated to have the 3 remaining trumps given his double of 5@C. Can you see any way to stop West from winning 2 more tricks with his @CQ98?|
