^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 340 - March 17, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
I played this week's deal yesterday in the finals of the ^*BJacoby Open Swiss Teams^*N at the ACBL North American Championships in Philadelphia. The bad news is that I misplayed this deal and went down in a slam that I should have made. The good new is that my team won the event despite our result on this deal!

My partner in Philadelphia was ^*BChristal Henner^*N. Christal and I had played a grand total of 12 deals (on ^*BBridge Base Online^*N) before the tournament, but we really hit it off at the table. Besides being a terrific player, Christal is also an excellent partner. I thoroughly enjoyed playing with her.

Christal and 2 of our teammates (^*BPeter Bertheau^*N and ^*BFredrik Nystrom^*N of Sweden) were part of a team that reached the semi-finals of the ^*BRosenblum Cup World Championships^*N last year in Montreal. Our other teammates, Italians ^*BFulvio Fantoni^*N and ^*BClaudio Nunes^*N, had an even bigger result in Montreal - they were the Gold Medalists in the ^*BWorld Open Pairs^*N. 

This was my 3rd win in a North American Championship event, but despite all of their international accomplishments, none of my teammates had ever won a North American Championship before yesterday. As such, our win in the Swiss was especially exciting. This was a great group of people and it was a privilege to be part of their first victory in a major ACBL Championship.

I played on the same team in the ^*BVanderbilt^*N and things were going very smoothly until we had to face the powerful ^*BNickell^*N team in the round of 16.

^*BNick Nickell^*N-^*BDick Freeman^*N, ^*BJeff Meckstroth^*N-^*BEric Rodwell^*N, and ^*BBob Hamman^*N-^*BPaul Soloway^*N (^*BEric Kokish^*N is their coach) are arguably the strongest bridge team in the world right now. This team was playing in great form against us and they continued to do so for the next several days after they knocked out my team. Eventually the Nickell team won the Vanderbilt. Congratulations!

The entire semi-finals and finals of the Vanderbilt were broadcast live through ^*BBridge Base Online^*N. Every time we do a live vugraph broadcast we set new attendance records on our site. This time there were well over 1400 people logged in at the peak time and over half of these were watching the live broadcast (presumably the other half preferred to play online bridge).

These broadcasts have been very well received and we will be producing presentations of several other major tournaments in the upcoming months. I just got word that a Junior tournament in Sweden will be broadcast through ^*BBridge Base Online^*N on March 22 and 23. When the session starting times are known this information will be posted at:

^-{ ^*BWarning^*N: This week's deal is extremely complicated and time 
 considerations prevent me from analyzing all possible variations! }

pg| ***** 2 ***** |

st||sk|s|hs|sc|nt|In this week's complicated deal, I dealt and opened 1@C as South with neither side vulnerable. |mb|1C|
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


ls|sc|hs|sh|mb|P|mb|1S|mb|P|mb|2H|at|Christal responded 1@S and I reversed into 2@H. |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


ls|sh|mb|P|mb|3D|mb|D|mb|?|
at|Christal rebid 3@D which was doubled by East. Given that Chistal and I had spent about 30 seconds discussing auctions involving reverses, I was not exactly sure what kind of hand her 3@D bid suggested or what I should do now.|
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|Fortunately I knew there were several things that Christal did not have. She did not have 5 spades (or she would have rebid 2@S). She did not have a weak hand (or she would have rebid 2NT as an artificial negative). She did not have 4-card support for hearts or 3-card support for clubs (or she would have raised one of my suits). |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|So it sounded like Christal had a good hand with roughly 4342 distribution and that she needed more information from me in order to select the best final contract. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


hs|ss|at|If East had passed 3@D then I suspect I would have bid 3@S now (to suggest spade support and to leave Christal room to bid 3NT). The problem with bidding 3@S is that Christal might expect 3-card support for this call.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt|I considered bidding 3@S despite East's double, but it occurred to me that 3@S really ^*Ishould^*N suggest 3-card spade support once East doubles 3@D. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ls|ss|mb|P|at|The reason is that when the opener has a hand that lacks 3 spades (or any hand that has no comfortable bid), he can pass. I knew Christal would not play in 3@D doubled and I expected that my next decision would be easy.|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


mb|P|mb|3H|mb|P|mb|3S|
hs|ss|nt|I was right about that. Christal tried 3@H to suggest 3-card support (she would have raised earlier if she had 4 hearts). I was now able to bid 3@S and be fairly confident that my partner would play me for only 2 spades. |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


mb|P|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|?|
nt|Christal then bid 4@S and this really threw me for a loop. Remember, she had denied 5 spades (much) earlier in the auction. Did Christal know I had only 2 spades? Was she intentionally trying to play in a 4-2 fit? Was it possible that 4@S was the best contract despite the 4-2 fit? Why hadn't we spent some more time talking about our system?|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


ls|ss|mb|5C|hs|sc|nt|I was not exactly sure what was going on, but I still thought Christal was 4342. 4@S might well have been a playable contract, but I suspected that 5@C would be as well. I therefore bid 5@C and expected the auction to end. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


mb|P|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6c|
nt|It did not end! Christal continued with 5@D - clearly a cuebid of the @DA. I wasn't 100% sure where she was headed, but I really had no extra values for my reverse and I was quite certain that clubs should be trump. I therefore retreated to 6@C and once again expected the auction to end. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|at|This time I was right. Everyone passed and 6@C became the final contract. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


nt||pc|D2|ls|sc|at|West's opening lead was the @D2 (3rd and 5th best) and you can now see that you are actually in a reasonable contract! Remember that East doubled 3@D (suggesting length and strength in that suit) so you can assume that West was dealt exactly 3 cards in diamonds. Think about how you would play this deal as the declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sc|nt|There is a certain trump loser and the contract will have no chance if the clubs are 4-1. Assuming trumps break, |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|Hs|nh|hs|sh|at|at first glance it appears as though you will need the heart finesse to make your contract. Can you think of any way to give yourself a chance to make 6@C without having to depend on the heart finesse?|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|hs|nd|nt|This deal has "squeeze" written all over it, especially since the bidding and opening lead suggest that East has length in diamonds. If you are a student of squeeze play then, after winning the @DA at trick 1, |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


ls|nd|pc|DA|pc|DT|pc|D6|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sc|at|you might be tempted to ruff a diamond at trick 2 in an effort to begin the process of isolating the defensive diamond guard in the East hand. |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|As we will see (and as I found out at the table) it is actually a mistake to ruff a diamond immediately. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


ls|nd|hs|nc|at|The correct approach is to play 3 rounds of trump at once. |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|
pc|C5|pc|C8|pc|CA|pc|C9|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


pc|CK|pc|CJ|pc|C3|pc|CT|at|Suppose that both defenders follow to the @CA and @CK |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


hs|sc|at|and that the third round of clubs |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


ls|sc|pc|C2|pc|CQ|hs|nh|at|is won by West. You should discard a heart from dummy on this trick |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


ls|nh|pc|H4|pc|D4|at|and East discards a diamond. |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


pc|SJ|hs|nd|hs|sc|nt|Suppose that West returns a spade. At this point you might be thinking that you really should have starting ruffing diamonds earlier as it is now too late to isolate the diamond guard in East's hand. As we will see, that is really not necessary - watch. |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


ls|sc|ls|nd|hs|ss|at|Win the @SA |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


ls|ss|pc|S2|pc|S6|pc|SA|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|at|and then cash the @SK and @SQ. |

pc|S4|pc|S5|pc|SK|pc|S7|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


pc|SQ|pc|S8|pc|H2|pc|S9|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


hs|nd|Hs|sc|at|Next, ruff a diamond back to your hand |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sc|
pc|D3|pc|DK|pc|C4|pc|D7|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


hs|sc|at|and play your last 2 trumps. |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


nt|On the second last trump, |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


md|0,hq,,ht|ls|sc|pc|C7|sk||hs|ws|at|West will come under serious pressure whenever he is the defender who started with 4 (or more) spades. |
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


hs|ns|at|A spade discard would give you your 12th winner with dummy's remaining spade. |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


ls|ws|ls|ns|hs|wd|at|If West discards his last diamond, |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


ls|wd|pc|dj|pc|d56|pc|d9|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


hs|ed|hs|nd|at|then East will be left with the responsibility of guarding the diamond suit and a ^*Bdouble squeeze^*N will result on the next trick. |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|ed|hs|sc|nt|When the last club is played, |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


ls|sc|pc|c6|hs|wh|at|West must discard a heart. |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


ls|wh|pc|h|hs|ns|at|Dummy's remaining spade has served its purpose and it can now be discarded. |
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


ls|ns|pc|s3|hs|ed|hs|nd|at|Since East must keep his diamond to prevent the dummy's card in that suit from becoming a winner, |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


ls|ed|ls|nd|hs|eh|at|he must also come down to a doubleton in hearts. |
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


ls|eh|pc|H8|
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


mc|12|hs|nh|hs|sh|hs|eh|hs|wh|at|The position of the @HQ is now irrelevant as all of the defenders' hearts will fall under the @HK and @HA. |
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|nh|ls|sh|up|7|nt|Now suppose that West discards a heart on your second last trump. |
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


ls|wh|
pc|C6|pc|H3|pc|D8|pc|DQ|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


hs|sc|at|On the final club, |
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


ls|sc|pc|c6|hs|wh|at|West must discard another heart (a diamond would lead to East being squeezed as before). |
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


ls|wh|pc|h7|pc|s3|hs|ed|at|East can now afford to part with his diamond since West guards that suit. |
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


ls|ed|pc|d9|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


hs|ws|hs|wh|hs|wd|at|In the 3-card ending you know that West has exactly 1 spade, exactly 1 diamond, and therefore exactly 1 heart. |
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


ls|ws|ls|wd|nt|If the 1 heart that West holds is the @HQ then the rest will be easy. |
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


md|0,ht,,hq|at|If West's heart is a lower card, |
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sh|at|he will have to play it when you lead a heart to dummy's @HK. |
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|ls|Wh|
pc|H5|pc|HT|pc|HK|pc|H8|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


mc|12|hs|nh|hs|sh|hs|eh|At|Given that West is now known to be out of hearts, you will have a proven finesse against the @HQ with East. |
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


ls|sh|ls|nh|ls|eh|up|12|
hs|sc|nt|For those of you who are squeeze enthusiasts, the position that arises when the second last club is led |
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


ls|sc|pc|c7|hc|hjht|at|is similar to something called a ^*Bdouble guard squeeze^*N. If the @HJ and @HT were switched between the South and West hands, |
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


md|0ht,hj|at|the resulting ending is a classic double guard squeeze and the contract can be made in the same way. |
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


md|0hj,ht|lc|hjht|hs|ws|hs|ns|nt|The entire analysis up to this point is based on the assumption that West guards the 4th round of spades. This is a reasonable assumption to make since East's known diamond length makes it likely that West is the defender who guards spades. Besides that, if East guarded spades there could be no squeeze - you would need the heart finesse to make 6@C.|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


ls|ws|ls|ns|up|29|
hs|nd|hs|sc|nt|Now let's see why it would be a mistake to ruff a diamond at trick 2. |
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sc|pc|d3|pc|dk|pc|c2|pc|d7|
pg| ***** 68 ***** |


hs|wc|hs|sc|at|West would win the third round of clubs |
pg| ***** 69 ***** |


ls|sc|ls|wc|pc|ca|pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|c8|
pg| ***** 70 ***** |


pc|ck|pc|cj|pc|c5|pc|ct|
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


pc|c4|pc|cq|pc|h4|pc|d4|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


hs|wd|hs|Sc|at|and play another diamond for you to ruff. |
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


ls|wd|ls|sc|pc|dj|pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|c6|
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|ed|at|The diamond guard has been isolated in East's hand and a double squeeze is possible, |
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|ed|hs|ns|hs|ss|at|but there is no way to cash the top spades before the last club without ruining the sqeeze in some way. |
pg| ***** 76 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|hs|sc|nt|You have to play your last club before the spades are cashed, |
pg| ***** 77 ***** |


ls|sc|pc|c7|hs|ws|at|and, if West discards a spade on this trick, |
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


ls|ws|pc|s5|hs|ns|hs|nd|at|you will have to guess between discarding a spade and a diamond from the dummy. A diamond discard would be the winner on the layout shown above (because all of dummy spades are good). |
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|nd|md|0,s8hq,,h3h7|hs|ws|nt|If it turned out that West had started with 5 spades, however, |
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


ls|ws|hs|nd|at|discarding a diamond from the dummy in the hope that West had abandoned spades could be fatal. |
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


ls|nd|pc|d8|hs|ed|at|It would no longer be necessary for East to guard diamonds |
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


ls|ed|pc|dq|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sh|hs|eh|hs|wh|at|and you would have to guess the position of the @HQ in order to make your contract. |
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


md|0,h73,,s8hq|up|24|ls|nh|ls|sh|ls|wh|ls|eh|
hs|nd|hs|sc|nt|So ruffing a diamond at trick 2 is a mistake, but it is a mistake that an expert player would usually be able to get away with. I made that mistake and I did not get away with it, but it was not due to any ambiguity in the end position that I reached. |
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


md|0,hqh9s7,,cjdjd7|ls|nd|ls|sc|hs|ed|hs|ec|hs|wc|at|The reason I went down in 6@C is because the outstanding minor suit cards were actually distributed as you see above!|
pg| ***** 86 ***** |


ls|ed|ls|wc|ls|ec|hs|nd|hs|sc|nt|When I ruffed a diamond at trick 2, |
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sc|pc|d3|pc|dk|pc|c2|hs|wc|at|West was able to overruff with his doubleton trump (I still would have been fine if West had been dealt 3 clubs)! |
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


ls|wc|pc|c9|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


hs|ec|at|East still had a sure trump winner so my slam now had no chance (I ended up squeezing West in the majors to go down only 1). |
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


ls|ec|up|4|hs|nd|hs|sc|nt|If, instead of trying to ruff a diamond at trick 2, |
pg| ***** 91 ***** |


ls|nd|hs|nc|at|I had made the correct play of 3 rounds of trump, I would have had no trouble making my contract on the actual layout. |
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


up|3|ls|sc|ls|nc|ls|ec|hs|ed|hs|ec|at|While the distribution I lost to was very obscure (especially given that East didn't preempt with 3@D over Christal's 1@H), I must admit that I fully deserved the punishment that I received. |
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


ls|ed|ls|ec|nt|It was annoying to go down in 6@C because being able to accurately analyze deals like these at the table is one of the strengths of my game. I am not nearly as good on deals that involve things like delicate timing of crossruffs. |
pg| ***** 94 ***** |


nt|My only excuse for not making my slam on this deal is that my team was under serious time pressure. The match we were playing was going very slowly and this was the last board. If I did not play the hand within a minute or so, my team would have been penalized. Nice to have an excuse, and even nicer to have won the event despite needing an excuse for my play on this deal!|
