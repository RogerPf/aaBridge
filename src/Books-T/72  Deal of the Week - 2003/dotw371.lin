st||hs|ss|sk|s|nt|In this week's deal, I dealt and opened 1@S as South. My partner's 2NT response showed a balanced game-forcing hand with 2 or 3 spades. |
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


mb|P|mb|3D|mb|P|mb|3S|
hs|sd|ls|ss|at|I showed my diamond suit and my partner rebid 3@S to show 3-card support for my major. |
pg| ***** 3 ***** |


ls|sd|hs|sc|at|I cuebid 4@C |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


ls|sc|hs|sd|mb|P|mb|4C|mb|P|mb|4D|
at|and my partner's 4@D bid, clearly showing the @DK, nicely filled in one of the gaps in my hand. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


mb|p|mb|4h|ls|sd|hs|sh|nt|I chose to cuebid 4@H at this point. |
pg| ***** 6 ***** |


ls|sh|hs|sc|at|Given that I had never played with this partner before, I had no idea if he had read my 4@C bid as not just a cuebid, but a length-showing cuebid. |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


ls|sc|Hs|sh|at|If he had then there was no reason to cuebid hearts now (since my 4@C would have suggested that I held a singleton heart at the most). |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


nt|Regardless of what 4@C ^*Ishould^*N say about my heart holding, bidding 4@H now seemed like a good idea. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ls|sh|hs|sc|mb|P|mb|5C|
at|My partner came back with a 5@C cuebid. The knowledge that he held the @CK improved my hand |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


ls|sc|hs|ss|At|to the point that I was willing to take a shot at 6@S (I knew my partner had to have at least one Ace given all the bidding he had done and the fact that I held the @SKQ).|mb|P|mb|6S|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


nt||ls|ss|pc|HA|hs|nh|at|West's opening lead was the @HA. When my partner put down his dummy, his heart holding suggested that the poorish slam we had bid had just gotten better. |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


ls|nh|pc|H2|pc|H5|pc|H3|at|West's @HA won the first trick. |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


pc|HQ|at|He continued with the @HQ. Think about how you would play this deal as the declarer before reading on. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


hs|nh|Hs|sd|hs|sc|nt|Since I didn't know if I wanted to discard a diamond or a club on the dummy's @HK, |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


ls|sd|ls|sc|hs|ss|at|I decided to postpone this decision by ruffing the second round of hearts. |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


ls|ss|ls|nh|pc|H6|pc|H7|pc|S2|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sc|at|At first glance it appeared that my best chance was to plan to discard a club on the @HK, |
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|sd|hs|ns|ls|sc|ls|nh|at|and to ruff my diamond loser in the dummy, but I realized that there were some serious dangers to this approach. |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|For one thing, a 5-2 diamond break would put me at risk of either an overruff or a trump promotion. |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


ls|sd|ls|nd|hs|ss|at|Furthermore, if East was dealt 4 spades to the @SJ, ruffing a diamond in dummy would make it difficult, if not impossible, for me to pick up his trump holding (since I would never take a 2nd round trump finesse, a trump coup would be my only chance).|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|I therefore decided to probe the spade distribution by cashing the @SK in my hand |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


ls|ss|ls|ns|pc|SK|pc|S8|pc|S4|pc|S5|at|(both defenders followed small) |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|at|before playing a spade to the dummy's @SA. |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|pc|S3|pc|H4|pc|SA|pc|S6|
at|West discarded a painless heart on this trick. |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|at|I continued by finsessing the @S10. |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


ls|ns|ls|ss|pc|S7|pc|S9|pc|ST|pc|D2|at|West pitched an easy diamond. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


hs|ss|at|When I drew the last trump, |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


ls|ss|pc|SQ|pc|C4|pc|C3|pc|SJ|at|West parted with a club, his slowest discard - this one took about a second.|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


hs|nh|nt|While it was impossible to be certain, West's discards strongly suggested that he had been dealt 5 cards in hearts. If that was the case then I knew I would be able to win the rest of the tricks from here without having to guess, regardless of the distribution of the outstanding cards. Do you see what my plan was? |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


hs|ed|md|0,c2,,d5|sk||hs|wd|ls|nh|hs|nd|hs|sd|nt|There were 3 possibilities in the diamond suit. First, if West's diamond discard had been from a 4-card holding, I would have no diamond loser. |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


md|0,cq,,dj|at|Second, West might have discarded a diamond from a 3-card holding, meaning that East had a diamond stopper. |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


md|0,dj5,,cq2|at|Finally, West might have started with 5 diamonds in which case he still had a stopper in that suit. |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|I saw that I could not only find out how the diamonds were distributed, but more importantly ensure my contract (under the assumption that West was dealt 5 hearts), by playing 3 rounds of diamonds next (discarding a club from the dummy on the third round). |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |

pg| ***** 37 ***** |


ls|ec|pc|C2|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


hs|wd|at|so I knew that West had the master card in diamonds.|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


ls|wd|hs|nc|hs|sc|nt|I continued with a club to the dummy's @CK |

ls|nc|ls|sc|

ls|nh|ls|sd|
pc|HK|pc|HT|pc|D9|pc|H8|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sc|at|Finally, I played a club to my @CJ with confidence that the finesse would win. |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|ls|ec|pc|C7|pc|CT|pc|CJ|
hs|wh|hs|wd|at|Why was I confident? Because I knew that West had only 2 cards left. I knew that one of these was a diamond and I strongly suspected that his other card was a heart |
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


hs|ec|mc|12|at|- he could not have the @CQ as well. |
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


ls|wh|ls|Wd|ls|ec|up|14|md|0,cqt,,djt|hs|ed|nt|Suppose that it had been East, not West, who was guarding the 4th round of diamonds. |
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


ls|ed|hs|wh|At|West would have to discard on my 3rd diamond winner. A heart discard would surrender a trick at once |
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


ls|wh|hs|wc|at|so West would have to pitch a club to come down to 2 cards in that suit. |
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


ls|wc|pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|dt|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|Sc|at|As before, I would play a club to dummy's @CK |
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|pc|c9|pc|ct|pc|ck|pc|c2|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sd|at|and discard my diamond loser on the dummy's @HK.|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sd|pc|hk|pc|ht|pc|d9|pc|h8|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sc|nt|If East then followed small on the 2nd round of clubs, |
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|ls|ec|pc|c7|pc|c5|hc|ca|hs|wc|at|I would know to reject the club finesse as the @CQ would be certain to fall under the @CA. |
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


lc|ca|ls|wc|pc|ca|hs|ed|at|East's one remaining card would be known to be a diamond |
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


ls|ed|hs|wh|at|and one of West's 2 remaining cards would be known to be a heart. |
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


ls|wh|hs|wc|at|West would therefore have had to come down to a singleton @CQ. |
pg| ***** 59 ***** |
