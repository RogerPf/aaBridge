^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 369 - October 6, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
This week's deal was played in the recent ^*BDanish Cup FInal^*N by ^*BMichael Askgaard^*N who, along with his partner, ^*BGregers Bjarnarson^*N, and teammates, ^*BLars Villinger^*N and ^*BKasper Konow^*N, went on to win this event.

Those of you who have watched any of the ^*Blive^*N vugraph broadcasts that we produce on ^*BBridge Base Online^*N will be familiar with ^*BRoland Wald^*N (^*BWalddk^*N on ^*BBBO^*N). Roland, a very strong player from Denmark, is one of the best and most dedicated volunteers that we have when it comes to providing commentary and analysis during our vugraph broadcasts. Roland is also deeply involved in these productions from behind the scenes - he is the primary person who organizes, schedules, and makes contact with our various expert commentators. 

It was already difficult for me to thank Roland enough for all of the contributions he has made to our site, but now I have to thank him even more - it was Roland who brought this week's deal to my attention.

Speaking of vugraph, our next production will be of the ^*B2nd EBL Champions Cup^*N from October 10-12. Many of Europe's top stars will be playing in this prestigious event and it rates to make for an excellent broadcast. For session starting times, click on the blue rectangle below.

nt||cs|1|at|This year's EBL Champions Cup is being held in Rome and our vugraph broadcast of this event will be produced by ^*BBridge Base Italy^*N. My long time friend and business partner, ^*BVincenzo Delle Cave^*N (who runs our offices in Italy), will be in charge of organizing this production.

Vincenzo is another person who is well known to the ^*BBBO^*N community (his user ID is ^*BVincenzo^*N). Vincenzo runs tournaments on our site and most of his tournaments contain well over 100 tables. He is currently engaged in a friendly battle with the people from ^*BBridge Base Poland^*N to try to set the record for our largest ever (and quite possibly anyone's largest ever) online bridge tournament. The Poles currently hold the record at 130 tables, but Vincenzo assures me that he will soon be breaking this record!

Vincenzo sells several Italian language bridge software products through his web site (including a translation of ^*BBridge Master 2000^*N, our best-selling program). You can find out more about ^*BBridge Base Italy^*N and the software they sell through the following (Italian language) web site:

hs|ns|hs|ss|At|He would have liked to have been able to take a spade finesse, but the dummy did not have a single entry. As such, he cashed the @SA and @SK in the hope that the @SQ would fall doubleton. |

ls|nh|ls|sh|sk||hs|wh|hs|wd|hs|wc|nt|Prospects may have looked bleak from our point of view, but it turns out that West was now endplayed in 3 suits! |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


ls|wh|ls|wd|hs|sc|at|As West's @D2 signal had suggested, he still had the guarded @CK, but West could not afford to return a club without losing his 2nd trick in that suit. |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


ls|wc|ls|sc|hs|wd|hs|nd|hs|sh|at|A diamond return would allow the declarer to discard his heart loser - he would then lose only a club at the end. |

ls|sc|ls|wd|ls|nh|ls|nd|up|8|nt|At the point where West exited with the @H4, do you think it would have been better if he had got out with the @HQ instead? I have seen other deals in which leading a Queen in this sort of position is the only way out of an endplay. |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |

ls|sc|ls|nh|ls|nd|ls|eh|ls|ed|up|16|
hs|eh|nt|The one and only chance that the defense had was for East to ignore his partner's signal for clubs and switch to a heart instead (a play that would be very difficult, if not impossible, to find at the table). |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


ls|eh|pc|h2|hs|Sh|mc|9|at|Regardless of how declarer plays from here, subsequent accurate defense would defeat his contract. |

ls|sh|up|5|hs|sc|Hs|wc|nt|Since we have examined a possibly unrealistic opportunity for the defense, it is only fair that we do the same thing for the declarer. At the point in which Askgaard led a third round of trump, a club exit to West instead |
