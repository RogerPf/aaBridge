^-{ ^*BDeal of the Week 332 - January 20, 2003^*N
 ^*BBy Fred Gitelman^*N }
^-
Indonesia has been among the strongest and most consistent countries in the World Championships during the past 10 years. Although the Indonesians have yet to win a World Championship, they did come second in the 1996 World Teams Olympiad and they almost always seem to be in contention.

The partnership of ^*BEddy Manoppo^*N and ^*BHenky Lasut^*N have been at the top of Indonesian bridge for a long time. Eddy was the declarer in this week's deal which came from the 1996 ^*BCap Gemini World Top Pairs^*N. Only 16 of the best pairs in the world are invited to play in each Cap Gemini (a tournament that, sadly, no longer exists) and Eddy and Henky finished second in the 1996 running of this illustrious event.

Thanks to ^*BSyahrial Ali^*N of Bandung, Indonesia for sending this deal to me. Rial (as he is known to his friends) is a longtime follower of the ^*BDeal of the Week^*N as well as a keen student of bridge. If you would like to see one of your favorite deals appear as a future ^*BDeal of the Week^*N, please send me all the details by e-mail:

I have been receiving a lot of interesting deals by e-mail and I would like to thank all of the people who have taken the trouble to send me these deals. Unfortunately, there are only so many weeks in each year and it is impossible for me to write about all of the deals that I receive.

nt|In this week's deal, only North-South were vulnerable (the vulnerability is indicated by the graphic in the top left corner above - red is vulnerable and white is not vulnerable). Henky opened with a Precision-style 1@D as North and Eddy, South, ended up as the declarer in 4@H with the opponents passing throughout.

nt|Think about how you would continue as the declarer before reading on. 

|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


hs|nh|hs|sh|at|Eddy realized that the contract would be in danger only if one of the defenders was dealt 4 hearts to the @HJ |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ls|nh|ls|sh|hs|nd|hs|sc|hs|ss|at|since the dummy's diamonds could be used to take care of 2 of his black suit losers. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|ss|ls|sc|hs|nh|hs|Sh|nt|The fact that the defense seemed intent on forcing the dummy to ruff suggested that trumps might be breaking badly. However, in an event like the Cap Gemini, all of the players are more than capable of this kind of deception. Eddy considered finessing the @H10 on the second round of the suit, but he realized that this "big play" might not be required, even if East had 4 hearts to the @HJ.|
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


ls|sh|nt|He therefore attacked trumps in the normal fashion, by cashing the dummy's @HA |
pg| ***** 12 ***** |

pc|H4|pc|H5|pc|HK|pc|D2|at|West discarded a diamond on this trick, making it necessary for Eddy to put Plan B into action. Can you see how Eddy was able to come to 10 tricks from this point?|

pg| ***** 22 ***** |


hs|nd|at|When dummy's last diamond was played, |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


ls|nd|pc|DT|pc|C4|hs|sh|at|East correctly discarded a club and Eddy found the key play of ruffing this winner in his hand! |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


ls|sh|pc|H6|pc|C5|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


hs|nc|hs|sc|nt|It was now necessary for Eddy to guess the layout of the missing club honors. Eddy Manoppo is blessed with great table presence and this position did not pose much of a problem for him. West, who had shown up with the @SKQ and a singleton heart, was unlikely to have the @CA given his pass over 1@H at favorable vulnerability. |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|Therefore Eddy led a club to the dummy's @CJ |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |

sk||hs|eh|hs|ec|at|Here are the cards that remained. Regardless of what East returned, he was not going to win a trump trick. |
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


ls|ec|hs|sh|at|A heart return would allow Eddy to finesse the @H10, |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|sh|hs|ec|at|but East's actual club return was no better. |

pg| ***** 34 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|Sh|ls|Eh|up|16|hs|nd|hs|sc|nt|Note that Eddy also would have succeeded if he had discarded a club (instead of a spade) on the third round of diamonds. |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


ls|nd|ls|sc|pc|dj|pc|d8|pc|c2|pc|d9|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


hs|nd|hs|eh|at|East might ruff the dummy's last diamond, |

ls|nd|ls|eh|pc|h8|pc|dt|pc|h8|hs|sh|at|but Eddy would then be able to overruff |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|sh|pc|ht|pc|c5|

up|11|ls|nc|ls|ss|ls|ec|hs|ec|nt|In this variation, a club discard by East on the second last diamond would not help the defense. |

pg| ***** 51 ***** |


hs|wc|hs|eh|hs|sh|mc|10|at|West's forced club return would result in his partner's remaining @HJ doubleton being picked up. As before, Eddy would end up with the 10 tricks that he required to make his contract. |
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


ls|wc|ls|eh|ls|Sh|up|24|
hs|nc|hs|sc|nt|Finally, it should be noted that Eddy could have made his contract in a similar manner by correctly guessing clubs early in the play. I will not get into the complex discussion as to which line of play on this deal represents the declarer's "best percentage chance", but this is something that the serious students of the game out there might enjoy thinking about. |
