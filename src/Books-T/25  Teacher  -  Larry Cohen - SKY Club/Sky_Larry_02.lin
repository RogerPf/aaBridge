pg| ***** 1 ***** |


nt||cs|2|ht|b|fp|2|at|^-{INTRODUCTION}
^-
|fp||at|In the first four weeks of this series (see last week) we will be facing a preempt by partner. When your partner preempts, you have an easy decision. If you are interested in game (rare), then bid accordingly. But, if you are ^*Inot^*N interested in game, just raise to the level of your side's number of trumps.

pg| ***** 3 ***** |


mb|2h|nt||ht|c|at|At favorable vulnerability (white versus red), your partner deals and opens 2@H. |
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


mb|p|at|RHO passes and it is up to you.  |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |


nt||cq|3|lb|*mYour call is?^Pass~3@h~4@h~2NT^2|nt||ht|c|at|First question: Are you interested in game? |
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


at|It is close, but I'd say no. |
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


at|A popular guideline here is to add your HCP to your number of trumps (12 + 3 = 15). |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|If the number is 17, then you should be interested in game. |
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


at|I'm not thrilled with memorizing such numbers, and this guideline is far from perfect, |
pg| ***** 11 ***** |


at|but I thought I'd mention it anyway.|
pg| ***** 12 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Since you aren't interested in game, your decision is easy |
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


at|- ^*BFollow the LAW^*N. |
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


nt||ht|c|hs|eh|at|Since partner has 6 trumps and you have 3, you want to bid to the 9-trick level. |
pg| ***** 15 ***** |


ls|eh|mb|3h|nt||ht|c|at|Raise to 3H. |
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


at|This raise is ^*BNOT^*N invitational to game. |
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


ub|1|mb|2n|nt||ht|c|at|If you were interested in game you would have started with 2NT.|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


ub|1|mb|3h|nt||ht|c|at|Over your 3@H, LHO thinks a while, |
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


at|shrugs, |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


mb|4s|at|and bids 4@S. |
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


sk|ns|mb|ppp|nt||ht|c|at|Let's jump over to his seat and play the hand. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


sk|ns|nt||ht|c|at|That's some hand that South holds. |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


at|By the same token, North's hand is the complete opposite - quite ugly. |
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|South had a tough guess over the preemptive bidding from E-W. |
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


ub|4|mb|x|at|He could have doubled, |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


ub|1|mb|3s|at|also could have bid a conservative 3@S. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


ub|1|mb|4sppp|nt||ht|c|at|I think 4@S is a practical guess; |
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


at|after all, his partner didn't have to have such garbage.|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


pc|hk|sk|y|nt||ht|c|at|Do you see how declarer should play 4@S after the @HK lead?|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|As usual, in a suit contract, declarer should count his LOSERS. |
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


hs|ncsc|nt||ht|c|at|Here, he has to lose 3 club tricks, |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


ls|ncsc|at|so to make the contract he can't lose anything else. |
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


hs|nh|nt||ht|c|at|There are no problems in hearts |
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


ls|nh|hs|ssns|at|and spades, |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


ls|nsss|hs|ndsd|at|so his eyes should immediately focus on the diamond suit.|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|With AQ10 opposite low ones,  |
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


ls|ndsd|hc|dkdj|at|your only chance is that both the king and jack are onside. |
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


lc|dkdj|nt||ht|c|at|For mathematicians out there, this is a 25% chance (probably better on this auction, where West has preempted).|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


hc|dakqjt|nt||ht|c|at|To take that double finesse in diamonds, |
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


lc|dakqjt|at|you need 2 entries to dummy, |
pg| ***** 41 ***** |


hc|s9853|at|but luckily you have them. |
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


lc|s9853|nt||ht|c|pc|hh|at|However, you have to be very careful at trick one. |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


hc|s53|nt||ht|c|at|If you carelessly ruff the first trick low, |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


lc|s53|pc|s|at|you are dead.|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


up|1|nt||ht|c|hc|sakqjt|at|Instead, you should ruff the first trick with a higher spade |
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


lc|skqjt|at|(if you really want to show off, you can trump with the ace!).|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


lc|sa|nt||ht|c|pc|sa|at|Then, |
pg| ***** 48 ***** |


hc|s9853|at|play your carefully preserved low spade to dummy |
pg| ***** 49 ***** |


lc|s9853|pc|ssss|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


hc|d2dt|at|to play a diamond to the 10. |
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


lc|d2dt|pc|dddd|
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


at|Your luck is in! |
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


nt||ht|c|at|Now, |
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


hc|s95|at|you have another small spade to reach dummy |
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


lc|s95|pc|ssss|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


hc|dq3|at|for another diamond finesse. |
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


lc|dq3|pc|dddd|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


nt||ht|c|mc|10|at|The rest is easy-10 tricks. |
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


up|17|hs|ss|nt||ht|c|at|As long as you concentrate at trick one, |
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


ls|ss|at|you should be able to figure out the gist of the problem.|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


at| As ugly as North's hand was, |
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


hc|s98|at|I hope you remembered to thank the dummy for the 9 and 8 of spades!|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |
