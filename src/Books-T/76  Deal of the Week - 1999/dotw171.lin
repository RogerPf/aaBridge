pg| ***** 4 ***** |


pc|D6|pc|D2|pc|D5|nt|The @DQ held the first trick as East contributed the @D2, a suit preference signal for clubs by partnership agreement. |
pg| ***** 5 ***** |

East returned the @S8 and Federico had to decide how to handle this trick.|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


ls|ns|lb|*CWhat card would you play?^^s9^sa9632|ls|ss|hc|S9|nt|Federico wisely played the @S9 from his hand. This proved to be a necessary play as we will see shortly. |

Federico made another good (and necessary) decision to overtake dummy's @SK with his @SA.|

Federico continued down the only winning path by ruffing his remaining diamond in the dummy, eliminating that suit. |

ls|nc|ls|sc|pc|C6|pc|CK|pc|C7|pc|D4|at|East won the @CK as West discarded a diamond.|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


hs|sh|hs|ns|at| East was out of spades and clubs. A diamond return would allow Federico to discard his heart loser while ruffing in dummy. The @S6 could later be used to draw the last trump.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


ls|sh|ls|ns|pc|H2|
hs|sh|nt|
East did his best by returning a heart and presenting Federico with a guess for his contract.|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


lb|*CWhat card would you play?^^H5^HQ5|

ls|sh|hc|h5|nt|
Federico had overcome many hurdles to get to this point and he was not about to stumble at the end. He correctly played the @H5 from his hand.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


lc|h5|pc|H5|sk||
hs|wh|nt|This prooved to be a good move as you can see by looking at the remaining cards. Federico's heart loser would disappear, regardless of the card that West played. |
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


ls|wh|pc|hk|pc|ha|at|West actually chose to play the @HK and Federico won the trick with dummy's @HA. |
pg| ***** 27 ***** |

pg| ***** 28 ***** |


up|5|md|0,hj,,hk|hs|eh|hs|wh|nt|Federico's winning guess in hearts was not really a guess. The @HK and @HJ have now been reversed and we are back at the point where Federico exited in clubs to East's @CK.|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


ls|eh|ls|wh|hs|ws|nt|If East was dealt the @HK, West would ruff his partner's winner on the third round of clubs. |
pg| ***** 30 ***** |

pg| ***** 31 ***** |


hs|wh|at|A heart lead from West's side of the table would establish the setting trick in hearts for the defense.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


ls|wh|up|19|hs|ss|nt|Now's let's go back even further and see why it was necessary for Federico to play the @S9 from his hand when East returned the @S8 at trick 3. Suppose Federico had played a low spade instead of the @S9 to win the trick in dummy (the @SA play fails for the same reason).|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


ls|ss|pc|s|pc|s|pc|sj|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


hs|ns|hs|ss|nt|The contract would now fail. Suppose Federico wins the second round of spades with the @SA as before (nothing else is better). |
pg| ***** 35 ***** |

pg| ***** 42 ***** |


hs|ed|nt|
East can now defeat the contract by returning a diamond. |
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


ls|Ed|pc|da|hs|sh|hs|ns|at|This return gives up a ruff and discard that takes care of South's heart loser. |
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


pc|h|hs|ws|ls|sh|nt|The defense will come out on top, however, as West's @S10 will be promoted into the setting trick after dummy ruffs with the @SK. The difference here is that when South plays the @S9 on the first trump play, if West does not cover, South is left in his hand and can ruff his diamond.|

Nice work by our friend Federico in avoiding all the pitfalls in this deal!|
