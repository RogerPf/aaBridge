bt||rh||ah|Deal of the|ah|Week #164|nt|
This week's deal is based on a real one, but unfortunately your author did not find the correct line of play at the table. The deal was played in October during a practice match at the home of Francesco Angelini in Rome.

Francesco and partner Antonio Sementa, along with their teammates Lorenzo Lauria-Alfredo Versace and Andrea Buratti-Massimo Lanzarotti were practicing for the upcoming IOC Grand Prix, an event which they subsequently won. The same team are reigning World Champions, having won the Rosenblum Cup last year in Lille, France.

Bridge Base Inc. President Fred Gitelman was invited to play with Federico Primavera in this practice match. Federico is not only one of Italy's brightest young bridge talents, he is also the developer of the BridgeTV web site (www.bridgetv.net).

The Italians are well known as magnificent bridge players, but they are also magnificent hosts. Many thanks to Francesco, Federico, Vincenzo Delle Cave and all of our other friends in Italy for your warmth and hospitality while we were in your country.

Thanks to Federico for being a good partner when I did not find the right play on this week's deal.|

nt|We can't remember exactly how the auction went when this deal took place, but it was something like the above, with 2NT being a transfer to clubs. In any case, Francesco, East, was known to have a maximum strong notrump. Antonio, West, was known to have a weak hand with long clubs. The final contract was 3@H.|

Antonio found the killing lead (as usual) of the @H9. Think about how you would play as declarer before reading on.|

Hint: The contract will be in danger only if trumps are 3-1 and spades are bad. Can you see any way in which you might succeed if this is the case?|

Despite going down on this deal, Fred (and Bridge Base Inc. Vice President Sheri Winestock) had a wonderful time in Italy. Thanks again to all of our Italian friends!|
