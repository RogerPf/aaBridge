In a rematch between last year's Rosenblum Cup finalists, Italy once again defeated Brazil to win the Open Team event of the IOC Grand Prix. Congratulations to our friends Francesco Angelini-Antonio Sementa, Lorenzo Lauria-Alfredo Versace, and Andrea Buratti-Massimo Lanzarotti on another impressive victory!

This was the first IOC Grand Prix that also featured a women's event. The European team of Sabine Auken-Daniela von Arnim (Germany), Véronique Bessis-Catherine D'Ovidio (France), Pat Davies-Nicola Smith (Great Britain), and Bep Vriend-Marijke van der Pas (The Netherlands) defeated the United States 278-210 over 128 boards.

This week's deal took place in the 1999 IOC Grand Prix and features Sabine Zenkel as declarer. Sabine's careful technique and accurate card-reading enabled her to make a 3NT contract in which most of the field went down. The deal has been rotated to make South the declarer.

Many consider Sabine and Daniela to be the strongest women's pair in the world today. This pair is also special in that they both always radiate class and charm. It is a pleasure to play against this pair regardless of who is winning at the time.|

Sabine correctly inferred that since West was known to have 4 spades, 5 diamonds, and at least 2 clubs, the heart suit was unlikely to run.|

Furthermore, there was a good chance that West was out of clubs. Sabine therefore developed another spade trick by driving out West's @SK.|

hs|shnh|nt|In the 3-card ending, Sabine knew there was no point in taking the heart finesse as one of East's last 3 cards was known to be a club. East had been show up squeezed down to  a doubleton heart so she knew to cash the @HA and @HK.|

mc|9|nt|Towards the end of the deal Sabine knew she was going to make her contract, but she was pleased, nonetheless, to see the @HQ appear on her left - perhaps her careful play would earn the European team a swing. So it proved to be. Nicely played Sabine, and congratulations on your team's victory in the IOC Grand Prix!|
