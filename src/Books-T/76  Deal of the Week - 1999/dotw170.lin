nt||bt||rh||ah|Deal of the|ah|Week #170|nt|
This week's deal is a double dummy problem based on a deal from real life. In a double dummy problem you are allowed to look at all 52 cards. The idea is to decide if (and how) declarer can make his contract assuming best play by the defense.

There is a remarkable new computer program that is able to solve any double dummy problem in a matter of seconds. That is even more impressive when you consider that even the best human bridge players have been known to spend several weeks solving such problems. The program is called Deep Finesse and was written by William Bailey. You can find out more about Deep Finesse, try a demo version, or order the program through:

www.deepfinesse.com

We are proud to report that we figured out the correct answer to this week's deal without the help of Deep Finesse. We were not completely confident in our answer, however, and used Deep Finesse to confirm our findings. It took us about an hour before we thought we had this one right. It took Deep Finesse about half a second!

Deep Finesse is an absolute must for anyone who is seriously interested in bridge analysis. Besides being an invaluable tool, the program has an attractive and intuitive user interface and excellent online help.|

Suppose the final contract is 6NT (yes it is a very poor contract and yes the bidding is very poor). |

Can you think of a way to win 12 tricks against best defense?|

pg| ***** 7 ***** |


ls|nc|ls|sc|hs|nd|hs|sd|at|It looks like you will need some sort of squeee for a 12th trick and your first thought might be to duck the opening lead in an attempt to rectify the count down to 1 loser.|

It turns out that if you duck the first trick the contract will fail. West can continue diamonds or switch to a spade or club. In either case it will be impossible to win a 12th trick.|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ls|sd|nt|In order to win 12 tricks you must win dummy's @DA at trick 1.

hs|wh|nt|On the last round of clubs West must keep 2 hearts (or else the @HK would drop his @HQ exposing East's @HJ to a finesse). |

ls|wh|hs|ws|hs|wd|at|It doesn't matter if West discards a spade or a diamond. |

Congratulations if you figured this one out. It was not an easy problem (unless you happen to have a copy of Deep Finesse).|
