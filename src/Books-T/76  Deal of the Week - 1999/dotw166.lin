Reminder: The vulnerability is shown by the graphic in the top left corner. On this deal East-West are vulnerable (red) and North-South are not vulnerable (white).|

West accurately shifts to the @SQ, overtaken by East with the @SA. |

It seems safe to assume that West has the @SJ. Think about how you would play before reading on.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


hs|shns|nt|It is likely that the defense will succeed in preventing you from ruffing one of your heart losers in the dummy. |
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


ls|nssh|hs|Ncsc|at|At first glance it appears that you will have to find the @CQ in order to make your contract. There is a 2-way finesse available in clubs. Which defender do you play for the @CQ?|
pg| ***** 10 ***** |


ls|ncsc|

sk||hs|ecwc|nt|If you had to guess which defender was dealt the @CQ, you would probably play East for that card (because West is known to have more spades than East and the information about the other suits is neutral). This is not a deal for guessing, however. The contract is assured if you play clubs properly.|

ls|ncsc|hs|ndss|at|Those entries can be used to ruff dummy's diamonds in the closed hand. |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


ls|ndss|hs|ws|at|If West ruffs in (or overruffs) at any time you will be able to ruff your heart loser in dummy afterall. There is nothing he can do to stop you from making your contract.|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |

hs|scnc|nt|For example, you can start by overtaking your @CK with dummy's @CA. |

hs|ndss|nt|This deal is a slightly unusual example of a dummy reversal. A dummy reversal involves ruffing in the long trump hand in order to establish the short trump hand. It is difficult to spot the possibility of a dummy reversal on this deal due to the weakness of dummy's trump holding.|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


ls|ndss|hs|ncsc|nt|
By handling the club suit correctly South will either not lose a club trick, or, if a club trick must be lost, enough entries will remain to complete the dummy reversal.|
