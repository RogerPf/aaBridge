The play of a suit contract is in general much more complicated than to play a NT-contract. 
To get a better idea you might look up this page:

^c@2{This is a general rule in suit-contracts too: Make your plan of play, BEFORE you touch a card in dummy!!! ^z}

{^c@2In suit contract we count primarily the number of losers, not the sure tricks. ^z}

{^c@2The two most important ways to avoid losers are:
^d Plan 1: Ruff with dummy's trumps.
^d Plan 2: Discard on dummy's long suit. ^z}

{^c@2In this lesson we shall see some variations of Plan 1: Ruff with dummy's trumps. ^z}

{^c@2Questions you should always ask yourself before playing the first card:
^d1. How many losers do I have?
^d2. Are those losers unavoidable or delayed?
^d3. How can I get rid of some losers?
^d4. Shall I draw the trumps right away and how many (to make my bid safely)?
^d5. What are the dangers for my bid? ^z}

{^c@2The most important decision declarer has to make is: to draw opponent's trumps at once or postpone it. 
This will be the topic of the next lesson. ^z}

Finessing the @HK is in theory a 50% probability. In reality however considering the bidding it is unlikely West would underlead his @hK.  But why rely on a 50% chance when there is a plan that is 100%? What is this plan?|
pg| ***** 16 ***** |


sb|sPlan 1: ruffing a club loser in dummy.|
pg| ***** 17 ***** |


at|
While it is not an obvious solution, only this plan is fullproof. Do you first play one or more rounds of trumps?|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


sb|sI think that playing on trumps even only one round could be fatal.|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|You are right again. The correct defence against your ruffing plan (Plan 1) consists in playing trumps as often as possible. You must lose the lead twice in @cs. To make sure you can ruff the 4th @c round, you need all of your current 3 dummy trumps. So you need to attack the clubs right away.

sb|s|up|19|
nt|You went down in a 100% foolproof contract. The only thing you need is for trumps not to be divided 4-0 (void with WEST).
From the bidding (West's overcall promises at least 5 spades) you know that EAST has at most 2 @ss. Therefore this is a time when you draw trumps in a flash to prevent overruffs.|sb|s|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


at|
The trump situation is much different than hand 1. Here you have enough trumps in dummy so you can pull out opponents trumps in 3 rounds (assuming at worst a 3-1 split) while keeping one in dummy for ruffing a spade loser.
It is allowed that you lose 2 @ss and @cA. You need to ruff only 1 @s to make your bid.|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|Now let's play the hand once more, the correct way.
|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


sb|sWhy not hold-up once?|
pg| ***** 46 ***** |


at|There is nothing to be gained from a hold-up. On the contrary, if West has 6 cards in @s, then the opponents could quickly defeat you by winning the first 4 tricks: @sK, @s ruff, @cA and a 2nd @s ruff.|

How can you get rid of your delayed @d loser?|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


sb|sI don't really know. How can I ruff a loser when the suit is 3-3?|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


at|
Good comment. Look closely at both the master-hand and dummy. Do you see something that could be used to discard a diamond in the dummy hand? Thereby creating a doubleton @d in dummy, and allowing eventually a ruff in the short hand (dummy) of the small @d loser left in the master-hand.|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


sb|sWell...we have an extra heart winner in the master-hand. Is that it?|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


nt|Yes. You can execute the Plan 1 in 2 steps:
1. You discard a @d in dummy on your @hs extra winner.
2. You then ruff the @d loser in the short hand.|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


sb|sWhat about trumps? Should I start with 1 or more rounds?|at|| 
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


at|
Certainly not. You were so lucky that opponents did not lead a trump. If you give them a 2nd chance, good defenders would cash their 2 winners, @sAK, and lead a 3rd @s, preventing you from ruffing and defeating your bid.|
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


sb|sAny other danger I should know about?|at||
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


at|
Yes. As always, when you have the choice to take the lead either in dummy or in the hand, you should think about which one is best. When using the Plan 1 you need to preserve your master-hand entry.|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |

The @sK is a lure, an illusion. With this kind of hand, go for the safe plan. Use the Plan 1 which is 100% sure. However you need to start right away playing on @ss until you can ruff the last one in the short hand.
