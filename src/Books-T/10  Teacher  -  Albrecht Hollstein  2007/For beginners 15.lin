at|#3The play of a suit contract is in general much more complicated than to play a NTcontract. 
To get a better idea you might look up this page:
^*Hwww.albrecht-hollstein.de/Bridge/Lessons/Play a suit contract/How to play Suit-contract summary.htm^*N|

ht|h|fp|3|cs|7|cp|9|at|
#3^c@2{This is a general rule in suit-contracts too:
Make your plan of play, BEFORE you touch a card in dummy!!! ^z}
|
cs|2|fp||cp||
at|#4{^c@2In the last lessons we learned that in a suit contract we count primarily the number of losers, not the sure tricks. 
You count the losers of the main hand which is generally the one with the more trumps. ^z}|
cs|8|
at|
#5{^c@2The ways to avoid losers are:
^d Plan 1: Ruff with dummy's trumps.
^d Plan 2: Discard on dummy's long suit.
^d Plan 3: Make tricks with lower honors by finessing.
^d Plan 4: Score extra tricks in trumps
^e      (e.g. cross-ruff; dummy reversal; trump coup).

{^c@2In this lesson we shall see a variant of Plan 3, the elimination play: It is described as the situation in which an opponent has to choose between leading towards a tenace or conceding a ruff and discard.  ^z}@0|

ht|h|at|#7@4
{^c@2Questions you should always ask yourself before you adopt an elimination play:
^d1. Do I have a problem suit where I have to make a guess or where leading the suit (breaking it) may cost a trick?
^d2. Do I have enough trumps in both hands to make a ruff and sluff possible?
^d3. Is it possible to eliminate the side suits?
^d4. How will I put a defender on lead? ^z}|
cs|2|

at|

{^c@2Most elimination plays rely on a tenace in some suit. Often it is a holding which will benefit from a lead by an opponent. Let's see some examples:
^d1. Qxx  Jxx One trick is certain if suit is lead by an opponent.
^d2. AQT  xxx Two tricks are certain if neither opponent has a safe exit.
^d3.  AJx  KTx Three tricks are certain. ^z}

nt|Now we lead a @s and claim our bid. It does not matter who has that 3rd @s or what he does when he gets in with it. The luckless defender can do one of two things: play into the @d tenace, or give declarer a ruff and discard.|

If west plays @cQ then you get rid of a @dloser in dummy and ruff in hand.
At last you can now see that you use your last trump in dummy to ruff the third @d in your hand.|

This is not a bad plan. It has very good probabilities to work out (75%). But can you think of a plan that is totally safe (100%)?|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


sb|sGrrr... On a spade lead I had 12 tricks on top....|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


at|
Exactly! Maybe you can make an opponent do just that. As we saw previously there is a plan to make the opponent play through your tenace or give you a ruff and discard. Always consider using an elimination play when looking for an extra trick, with lots of trumps in both hands, and the possibility of eliminating the side suits.|

Correct! Sometimes you can put a defender on lead in the problem suit itself.|nt||
