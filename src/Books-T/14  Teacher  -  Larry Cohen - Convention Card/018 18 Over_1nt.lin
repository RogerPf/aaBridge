^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|In this new series (updated and revised from the previous decade), I want to take the reader through the ACBL Convention Card. I will give my advice on what conventions are important, and which are not. My opinions reflect 25 years of writing and teaching and are aimed at the intermediate level. This series is not for beginners and not for National Champions. Anyone in between will hopefully benefit from my thoughts.|

I am very much in the KISS (Keep It Simple Sweetheart) School. I believe that focus on declarer play and defense is much more important than adding a fancy convention. If a convention is hard to memorize I will not endorse it. If it is highly artificial, I will say NO. If it doesn't come up much, it shouldn't be in your arsenal. The only conventions I will endorse, must meet all three of these requirements:
^cNot highly artificial;
^CEasy to remember and play;
^cComes up frequently.|

That said, I will touch on EVERY convention listed on the ACBL Convention Card.  I will downplay the "ones to do without" and fully explain those to "do with." |

cs||fp||ht|f|va|5|cp|8|AT|^h@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|This is the 18th in a series of articles taking the reader through the ACBL Convention Card.

When the opponents open 1NT, there are many options. Only the newest and natural bidders would go without a convention here. I'm the last one to push conventions, but this is an area high on my list where I recommend playing "something."|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


AT|

There are numerous conventions available; even if you go alphabetically you can list: ASTRO, BROZEL, CAPPELLETTI,  DONT. That's just the start of the list. You can click this |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.larryco.com/BridgeArticles/ArticleDetails.aspx?articleID=83^*N|CP||AT| link to read about my favorite method: DONT. I prefer DONT because it allows you to show all 1- and 2-suiters without reaching the 3-level. Space doesn't allow a detailed description here of all the methods. |
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


ht|r|at|^b@2More important than which convention you play, are the following partnership issues:
 
1) Are you playing the same methods against all notrump ranges (weak and strong)?|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT|

It is hard to memorize two different systems, but if your defense against a strong notrump doesn't employ a strong double, you do need that option available against a weaker notrump.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |

2) Does anything change if you are in balancing seat (1NT P P ??)  ?|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


AT|
I suggest playing the same methods, but allowing lighter actions in balancing seat. |

PG| ***** 11 ***** |


va|2|AT|
For example, suppose you overcall with 2@D to show Diamond and either major, and the next player doubles. What do "advancer's" actions mean? What is Pass? What is redouble?  In such a situation, I'd suggest: Pass="diamonds -- to play."  XX="pick-your major"  2@H = "my own heart suit--I don't care if you have spades -- don't correct"  2@S = "my own spade suit--I don't care if you have hearts -- don't correct"|

4) Is your philosophy to act in the direct seat aggressively? How important is suit quality or vulnerability?|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


va|2|AT|
I suggest that direct seat actions show either a good hand (like an opening bid) or very good/long suits. It is too perilous to get involved with, say, king-empty fifth in one suit and queen-jack-fourth in the other. Exercise caution when vulnerable.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |

5) In balancing seat are you likely to be very aggressive?|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


va|2|AT|
My experience says that you should be very aggressive in this position. Don't let them play 1NT. Balance! Accordingly, if your partner dutifully balances over 1NT, don't hang him. Let him out in a partial. Don't Blackwood him into a grand slam.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |

6) How important is it to use double for penalty?|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


va|2|AT|
These days, there is a big debate as to whether or not you need a PENALTY (or "card-showing") double of 1NT.  I am not a big believer in penalty doubles. I prefer to have the double available as artificial. However, against weak notrumps, I need penalty doubles. if you do play penalty doubles, remember to discuss what it means if your partner pulls. I recommend: "Front of Card." In other words, if you make a penalty double and partner bids 2C, treat it as Stayman. If he pulls your double to 2D or 2H, treat is as a Jacoby transfer. For more on defending against a weak notrump, see the end of this article.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


AT|

Regardless of the method you use, be sure to discuss and agree with your partner on items #1-6 above. Interfering with the opponents' notrump is an important area that occurs frequently. As a side note: Be prepared for their interference over your 1NT!|

^-|cs||fp||ht|c|AT|^*B1) Comment on competing against a weak NT^*N
Howard disagrees with Cohen about the need for a penalty double over a weak NT. It is a common misconception that you can get a big score by trying to double them. In Howard's extensive experience with the weak NT, he very rarely gets a bad result when the opponents try to double his 1NT opener. Weak NTers are usually strong players and they have good runout schemes for escaping to 2 of a suit.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


AT|

Although there is no perfect system to combat the weak NT (which is one of the main reasons Howard plays it), Howard recommends you play natural overcalls and double as takeoutish showing a balanced hand whose minimum strength is near the top of the NT range. For example, if the NT range is 12-14 the doubler should have at least a good 13. That system works as well as any.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


AT|

Howard plays "transfer" overcalls over a weak NT, where the overcaller bids the suit below his real suit. For example, if Howard overcalls 2D over 1N, that shows hearts. This is essentially like playing natural overcalls except it gives the overcaller a little more flexibility to keep bidding with a strong or 2-suited hand (since partner can't pass the overcall).|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


AT|

Many players like to play the Cappelletti convention against a weak NT. Howard definitely recommends against playing Cappelletti and has had good success against pairs that play it. If you find it easier to play the same thing against all NT ranges, DONT works reasonably well against the weak NT (and is one of Howard's all time favorite conventions against a strong NT).|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |

^*B2) Comment about balancing against 1NT^*n
If it goes 1NT-P-P-?, Howard agrees with Cohen that you should strain to balance when you have a hand with good distribution (a 6-card suit or a hand with a singleton or void). This sounds counter intuitive, but the weaker you are, the more you should want to balance. Why? Well, the points are probably evenly spread between the 2 sides. If you have a weak hand, that means partner is likely to have a strong hand. And he is sitting behind the strong opponent, meaning your finesses are going to work. Similarly, if your partner balances and you have a strong hand, don't "hang" them by bidding on. Be content to play a 2-level contract. If the opponents let you play there, you are likely to get a good result.|

^*B3) Comment about pulling penalty doubles^*N
As noted above, Howard is not a big fan of penalty doubles of 1NT. However, even if you decide to play them, Howard strongly disagrees with Cohen about what it means when you pull a penalty double. Cohen recommends you treat the penalty double as a strong NT and play "systems on" (e.g. 2C is Stayman, 2D is a heart transfer, etc.). The problem is the doubler often does not have a strong NT shape. So Howard recommends that all 2-level bids by partner of the doubler be natural and weak.|
