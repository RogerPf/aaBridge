^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|In this new series (updated and revised from the previous decade), I want to take the reader through the ACBL Convention Card. I will give my advice on what conventions are important, and which are not. My opinions reflect 25 years of writing and teaching and are aimed at the intermediate level. This series is not for beginners and not for National Champions. Anyone in between will hopefully benefit from my thoughts.|

I am very much in the KISS (Keep It Simple Sweetheart) School. I believe that focus on declarer play and defense is much more important than adding a fancy convention. If a convention is hard to memorize I will not endorse it. If it is highly artificial, I will say NO. If it doesn't come up much, it shouldn't be in your arsenal. The only conventions I will endorse, must meet all three of these requirements:
^cNot highly artificial;
^CEasy to remember and play;
^cComes up frequently.|

That said, I will touch on EVERY convention listed on the ACBL Convention Card.  I will downplay the "ones to do without" and fully explain those to "do with." |

CS|6|at|^h@2{ The Unusual notrump  }   |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.larryco.com/BridgeArticles/ArticleDetails.aspx?articleID=568^*N|CP||AT|

Let's start with the jump-overcall of 2NT. This is one of the first conventions that new players learn. The "Unusual" notrump shows a 2-suited hand (at least 5-5). The two suits are the "two lowest unbid suits." So, after the opponents open 1@H or 1@S, the jump overcall of 2NT shows at least 5-5 in the minors. Over a 1@D opening, the 2NT bid shows clubs & hearts. Over a 1@C opening, it shows diamonds & hearts. What strength? Usually it is a preemptive-type hand (weak)'but could be a very strong hand (in which case the 2NT-bidder will act again). The vulnerability is important; I'd show a 2-suiter with KJ9xx in each suit if not vulnerable, but would prefer to have better suits if vulnerable.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


hT|r|cs|6|aT|^B@2{  1NT Overcalls  }

When the opponents open one-of-any-suit and we overcall 1NT, it shows a balanced hand with the strength of a strong 1NT opening. A normal range for a 1NT opening is 15-17. The overcall can be slightly stronger, possibly up to 18. On the low end, a 15-count should be a decent 15, especially if vulnerable. So, the approximate range is 15 to 18. Of course, a stopper in the opponent's suit is a good idea (especially if the opening was a major). In balancing seat, it is normal to "subtract a king" so the range is approximately 12-15.|

^-|cs||fp||ht|d|va|4|cp|8|AT|^b@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|A big change the last several decades has come in responding to notrump overcalls. In the old days, cue-bidding the opponent's suit was used as Stayman. Nowadays, an easier (and better) system is employed. Simply treat a notrump overcall the same way as a notrump opening. So, 2@C is Stayman, 2@D is a transfer to hearts, etc. Pretend the auction started with 1NT. This is often called "Systems On" or "Front Of Card." Of course, this leads to a rare situation where you might transfer into their suit such as:|ht|i|va|3|cs|6|

at|^B@2Such an action would be strange, so either don't make this bid, or come up with a special meaning (I'd suggest that it shows the other major and invitational strength). Since it is so rare, and unlikely to be remembered, it is probably just best to ignore this strange "transfer" bid.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |

After a balancing 1NT, I suggest you KISS (Keep It Simple Sweetheart). Play "Front of Card" ' but just be aware that the balancing notrump is ^*Blighter^*N than a direct notrump overcall.|

^-|cs||fp||ht|c|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|For my intermediate students, this is one of the most misunderstood calls in bridge. A 2NT overcall after a one-level opening is indeed the "Unusual notrump" for the two lowest unbid suits. But a 2NT overcall after the opponents' weak two-bid is anything but Unusual. |
PG| ***** 10 ***** |

It is natural and balanced. It guarantees a stopper in the opponent's suit. The range is that of a strong 1NT opener'maybe a little stronger. I'd say it is at least 15 and could be up to 19. In the balancing seat, it is (as usual) about a king less (still natural, balanced and with a stopper). And again, play "Systems On" ' Stayman, Jacoby, etc.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


AT|

^B@2^*BMM: Unlike what Cohen recommends, Howard plays that a 2NT bid in the balancing seat over a weak 2 (e.g. 2H-P-P-2N) still shows a strong NT (15-18 or so) not 12-15.^*N|

^-|cs||fp||ht|c|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|This is even a more daunting call. It is natural and again shows a stopper in their suit. The range is crazy. It is wide enough to drive a truck through. If the opponents opened 3H, I'd overcall 3NT with a flat 16, but also with a flat 20. I also might have a gambling (trick-taking) type of hand such as:|ht|f|at|^B|ih|pSQ 7HK 2DA K Q 9 4 3 2CK 2|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


AT|

When in doubt, if it is at all conceivable to try 3NT, then close your eyes and go for it. Partner can usually be counted on for a little help. Even if he lets you down, you are unlikely to get doubled. Partner should not bury you when you make a 3NT overcall; he should assume you are already bidding some of his cards. If partner does bid, I suggest 4@C is Stayman and 4@D/4@H are transfers. There are many complex possibilities here, but why bother to memorize them when this situation doesn't come up very often? A jump overcall to 3NT is always a very good hand (roughly 20+ in playing strength)--as opposed to overcalling after a 3-level preempt, where you might have to do it under duress (with the equivalent of, say, only 16+).|

^-|cs||fp||ht|c|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|Finally, we have a notrump overcall that is not natural. In general, a 4NT overcall is for the minors. After the opponents' 4@H opening, I'd overcall 4NT with:|ht|f|at|^B|ih|pS7H2DA Q J 9 8 7CK Q J 6 5|AT|

It shows at least 5-5 shape. Again there are many complexities (really, 4NT can be any 2 suits), but this article can't go on forever. What's written here is sufficient for my "summary approach."|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|In general, a 4N overcall is 5-5 in the minors (assuming the opening bid was in a major). However, there is one exception. If the opponents open 4@S, then 4N shows any 5/5 hand. The suits are not necessarily the minors; one of the suits could be hearts. Therefore, responder must take that into account when bidding. Responder should only bid 5@D over 4N if he is willing to hear partner correct to 5@H. Otherwise he should bid 5@C even if he has better diamonds.|

^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|Note: Make sure your partnership discusses what 1NT means in this auction:|ht|f|cs|6|
at|^B{|ia|1cp1s1n|at|}|ht|f|at|^k@2Is 1NT natural, strong (15-18) with stoppers?  Or, is it a light takeout for the unbid suits?  These days, I recommend the former (strong) -- and, of course, systems on if North continues.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


ht|i|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Playing this as a strong NT (15-18) is fine. However, it is slightly dangerous. In general, the opponents have at least 20 HCP between them, often more. Therefore partner rates to be weak so you could easily be in trouble in 1NT. Therefore many good players play this as a "sandwich NT." It is defined as a weak takeout bid, less than an opening hand. Usually with 5 cards in the unbid minor and 4 cards in the unbid major. With a stronger hand and the 2 unbid suits, you can still make a takeout double.|
