^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|In this new series (updated and revised from the previous decade), I want to take the reader through the ACBL Convention Card. I will give my advice on what conventions are important, and which are not. My opinions reflect 25 years of writing and teaching and are aimed at the intermediate level. This series is not for beginners and not for National Champions. Anyone in between will hopefully benefit from my thoughts.|

I am very much in the KISS (Keep It Simple Sweetheart) School. I believe that focus on declarer play and defense is much more important than adding a fancy convention. If a convention is hard to memorize I will not endorse it. If it is highly artificial, I will say NO. If it doesn't come up much, it shouldn't be in your arsenal. The only conventions I will endorse, must meet all three of these requirements:
^cNot highly artificial;
^CEasy to remember and play;
^cComes up frequently.|

That said, I will touch on EVERY convention listed on the ACBL Convention Card.  I will downplay the "ones to do without" and fully explain those to "do with." |

^-|cs||fp||va|4|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|We've spent many months to get to the 2-level. Sort of. We did have a discussion of general approach and strong 2@C openings. Now, we have reached one of my favorite sections of the convention card. There are so many Bubbemeises ("old wives tales") when it comes to weak twos. Let's start with the easy stuff:|

pg| ***** 5 ***** |


ht|i|at|^i@2In the first 30-40 years of contract bridge, all two-level openings were strong and natural. Then, sanity prevailed. Now, 2@C (artificial) is used for all (rarely-dealt) strong hands, freeing up 2@D, 2@H, 2@S for more practical use. Today, only dinosaurs use strong 2-bids (although ACOL and other systems where 2@D, 2@H and 2@S have special meanings are prevalent in certain areas of the world).|

What should a weak two-bid show?|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT|^*B Typically a 6-card suit and about 5-11 HCP^*N. Within that definition there is lots of room.|

PG| ***** 10 ***** |


ht|i|at|^B@2At one point (in the mid-1980's) the ACBL had the "5-and-5 rule" (some people called it the "Marty Bergen rule"). You had to have at least a 5-card suit and 5 HCP for a weak two-bid. That rule lasted only a year or so. Now, "^*Banything goes.^*N"|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


AT|

There is lots of room for judgment. Vulnerability and position are crucial. If you are vulnerable, try to have a good suit and to be at the upper end of the HCP range. If you are in second seat (a bad position to preempt because the contract could easily belong to your side), be very sound. In all situations, be aware of suit quality. I don't think it is a good idea to preempt with a suit of ^*Bjack-empty-sixth^*N.|

^B@2^*BLaryy Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|Absolutely possible. I wouldn't preempt if the void made the hand too good for a preempt (see the first example in this article). But, if the hand is in range, why not have a void?|

^B@2^*BLaryy Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|You can preempt with a side 4-card major. But, I wouldn't open 2@S with this hand.|
HT|f|at|^b|ih|pSQ J 8 7 6 5HA Q T 3D5 4C3|ht|g|at|^k@2We could easily belong in hearts, and I'd be afraid of preempting our side out of that suit.|

HT|k|at|^b|ih|pSK Q J T 8 7H8 7 4 3D3 2C2|ht|l|at|^k@2However, I'd proudly open 2@S with the hand on the left. Who cares about the hearts when my spades are so good and my hearts are so bad?|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


ht|o|cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Basically I think it would be fair to say Cohen pretty much thinks there is nothing wrong with opening a weak 2 with an outside 4-card major. As with many things in bridge, he might occasionally make an exception. But he would aggree that you should not let the presence of a 4-card major deter you from opening a weak 2. Be reluctant to pass any hand that has the points and suit length to open a weak 2.

^-|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


fp||cs||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BLaryy Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|Not really important. Rather than focus on the top honors, I care more about the intermediate spots. I'd much rather have Q J T 9 8 7 than A K 5 4 3 2. The cards in the middle are what make the suit of "good quality" for preempting.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |

Next are a few (relatively easy) examples. Note the vulnerability and position. Assume you are playing a "normal" style (not super-conservative, not crazy aggressive). |

2@H. If you are waiting for @HK Q J T 9 8, you'll never get to preempt. This is a textbook weak two (albeit a minimum).|

3@C. Since there is no weak two-bid in clubs, we sometimes have to open 3@C with only a six-card suit.|

2@D. The side-void doesn't bother me. The side four-card club suit is no problem. The suit is excellent. So, why not 2@D?|

PASS. It's not so much the side major that is the problem. It is the poor heart suit. Maybe with @HK J T 9 x x we could talk. But, second seat unfavorable calls for extreme soundness.

^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|I'll leave you this month with one more question: "What about using 2@D as Multi or Flannery or for other purposes?" If you want to, go ahead and enjoy. Personally, I find a weak 2@D to be quite effective (and easy on my memory). |
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


AT|

However, in most parts of the world outside of America, 2@D to show a weak-two in either major is quite popular. Try such a bid at your local duplicate (if it is allowed there) in the U.S. and you're likely to get some disgruntled opponents.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|I think suit quality is vastly overrated. Although I would open a weak 2 with some suits that Cohen might feel are too weak, in general we are in agreement. Having said that, I think Example E is a clear weak-2 opener even if Cohen does not. With Example H, although I would open a weak 2 with that hand in all seats, opening a weak 2 in 1st and 3rd seats but not in 2nd seat is a reasonable compromise.

The reason I push opening a weak 2 with any suit is because many students look for excuses not to open a weak 2. I think this is the opposite of what your mind set should be. Your mind set should be that you want to open a weak 2 any time you hold 5-10 points and a 6-card suit and you should be very reluctant to pass. |
