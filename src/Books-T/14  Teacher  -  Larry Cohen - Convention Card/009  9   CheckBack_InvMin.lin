^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|In this new series (updated and revised from the previous decade), I want to take the reader through the ACBL Convention Card. I will give my advice on what conventions are important, and which are not. My opinions reflect 25 years of writing and teaching and are aimed at the intermediate level. This series is not for beginners and not for National Champions. Anyone in between will hopefully benefit from my thoughts.|

I am very much in the KISS (Keep It Simple Sweetheart) School.  I believe that focus on declarer play and defense is much more important than adding a fancy convention. If a convention is hard to memorize I will not endorse it. If it is highly artificial, I will say NO. If it doesn't come up much, it shouldn't be in your arsenal. The only conventions I will endorse, must meet all three of these requirements:
^cNot highly artificial;
^CEasy to remember and play;
^cComes up frequently.|

That said, I will touch on EVERY convention listed on the ACBL Convention Card.  I will downplay the "ones to do without" and fully explain those to "do with." |

This article we wrap-up some more difficult 1-level-opening follow-ups by examining these loose odd-and ends:

^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|New-Minor Checkback would barely make my top-10 list (maybe at number 9 or 10) for worthwhile conventions. It comes up frequently and serves a useful purpose. |
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT|

^*BThis popular convention is used when the OPENER rebids 1NT or 2NT. Responder bids the new minor as an artificial way to ask about (or "check back" on) the majors. Next we have Example Auctions. In each of these auctions, responder's second bid is new minor forcing. The responder is asking the opener about the majors (typically looking for 3-card support)^*N.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


AT|

New minor is used only by the responder and always as his second bid of the auction. It promises at least invitational (10 - 11) strength (after a 1NT rebid) and some doubt about what the final contract should be. In most cases, the responder will have 5 cards in his major and be trying to decide if the hand should be played in his suit or in notrump.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


AT|

When the new minor is bid, the opener must ALERT. If the opponents ask, he can explain: "My partner's bid is artificial and forcing for one round. He is asking me about my majors." The opener now should show 3-card support if he has it (with 4-card support he would have raised on the previous round). If the opener doesn't have 3-card support, his next obligation is to show 4-cards in the other major. If he has neither of the above, he makes the cheapest bid he can (over clubs he bids diamonds; over diamonds he bids notrump).|

Note: If you play this convention, make sure partner is playing it the same way as you. I suggest you play it as written here, but some people play that on Opener's 3rd bid he bids his cheapest major (up-the-line). (In other words, he might show 4 hearts before showing 3-card spade support.)|

^-|cs||fp||va|4|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|This convention reverses (or "inverts") the strength of minor-suit raises. In "Standard," a raise from 1@C to 2@C (or 1@D to 2@D) shows 6-9 and a raise to 3-of-the-minor shows 10-12 (limit). |
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


AT|

If playing "Inverted," then the raise from 1@C to 2@C is 10-12 and the raise from 1@C to 3@C is weak (typically less than 7). There is a gap for hands of about 8-9 points (too strong for 3@C, but not strong enough for 2@C). When playing this convention, here are the discussion points:|

I recommend that you can stop in a partscore if either player's next bid is 2NT or 3-of-the-minor. Otherwise, it is Game Forcing.|

I suggest relying on the vulnerability. At favorable, it can be something like Jxxxxx and out. At unfavorable, it would be much sounder, maybe up to AQ10xxx and out.|

ht|k|cs|6|at|^B@2 {  How many cards to raise?  }|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


va|2|AT|
In clubs, usually five or more. In diamonds, five are also the normal requirement, but it can occasionally be done with four (since a one-diamond opener is usually four-plus cards).|

ht|n|cs|6|at|^B@2 {  What does it mean if opener bids 2-of-a-Major after an inverted raise?  }|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


va|2|AT|
I recommend that it show a stopper/concentration (it is pointless to show a 4-card major, since responder should never raise a minor with a 4-card major). After this show of concentration, if responder bids 2NT or 3-of-the-minor, it can be passed.|
