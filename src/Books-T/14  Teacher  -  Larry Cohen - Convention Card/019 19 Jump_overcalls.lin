^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|In this new series (updated and revised from the previous decade), I want to take the reader through the ACBL Convention Card. I will give my advice on what conventions are important, and which are not. My opinions reflect 25 years of writing and teaching and are aimed at the intermediate level. This series is not for beginners and not for National Champions. Anyone in between will hopefully benefit from my thoughts.|

I am very much in the KISS (Keep It Simple Sweetheart) School. I believe that focus on declarer play and defense is much more important than adding a fancy convention. If a convention is hard to memorize I will not endorse it. If it is highly artificial, I will say NO. If it doesn't come up much, it shouldn't be in your arsenal. The only conventions I will endorse, must meet all three of these requirements:
^cNot highly artificial;
^CEasy to remember and play;
^cComes up frequently.|

That said, I will touch on EVERY convention listed on the ACBL Convention Card.  I will downplay the "ones to do without" and fully explain those to "do with." |

If you have used a time machine to bring you and your computer back to 1950, you had better be prepared to play such jumps as strong. However, as all of you are reading this in the 21st century, you can expect such calls to be weak.  (There is a small minority that treats these jumps as "Intermediate" when vulnerable).|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


ht|r|at|^B@2What are the requirements for this weak jump overcall? Let's keep this easy. If you would open a weak two-bid, then you can make a jump two-level overcall. If you would open with a three-level preempt, then you can make a three-level jump overcall. Vulnerability and suit quality are key. Next, are some examples.|

ht|g|at|^k@2I prefer to have a 7-card suit for a three-level jump overcall, but would do so with the right 6-card suit--as in the third example. As usual, vulnerability is a big consideration.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


AT|


If I were vulnerable against not, I'd be afraid on all three of these hands. If I were not vulnerable, I'd gladly bid 3 on all of them. Everyone has to choose their own comfort level, usually consistent with your style for opening preempts.|

If you want more science, you can play that 2NT after partner's jump overcall is artificial. You can use it for Feature ("Front of Card"), or you can use it to ask for shortness.  I find that this never comes up--not worth the memory strain.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


AT|

Whatever you do, stay in character. if you are a sound preemptor, don't change your style for jump overcalls. If partner expects you to have a good suit and a decent hand, don't start zigging and zagging. |

^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|Bonus for very experienced players:

ALERT:  What does it mean if you jump overcall after they have preempted?  For example in:|

ht|g|at|^jauction, or.|
ht|h|cs|6|at|^B{|ia|,,2h4c|at|}|ht|i|at|^jthis auction you are South with 3@S and 4@C bids.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


ht|k|AT|^B@2There is a good saying: "You can't preempt a preempt." Once your opponent has preempted, you shouldn't also be able to preempt. Therefore, the jumps in the auctions above don't show weak hands. They show good hands. How good? "Intermediate." |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


AT|

This means about 16-18 in playing strength (more than a full opening bid) and a good 6+ card suit. So, on the first example, a 3@S jump overcall would look something like:

^B@2^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|In the second auction,|ht|c|cs|6|at|^B{|ia|,,2h4c|at|}|ht|c|at|^j@2without any special agreements, the jump to 4@C would also show an intermediate hand with 6+ good clubs.|
ht|f|at|^b@2However, many experts use this jump (to 4-of-a-minor) as a Roman Jump Overcall |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.larryco.com/bridge-learning-center/detail/116^*N|CP||AT|. You would need to discuss with your partner if you use this method. If so, a jump to 4@C shows 5+C and 5+ in the other major. A jump to 4@D is 5+D and 5+ of the other major. So, in the auction shown above, 4@C would be 5+C and 5+S.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


AT|

When using Roman Jump Overcalls, the cuebid (3@H) in the auction above is freed up to ask for a stopper. It won't be Michaels |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.larryco.com/bridge-learning-center/detail/761^*N|CP||AT| (since the Roman Jump covers the 5-5 hand). The cuebid would show a good hand (usually with a running suit) and requests partner to bid 3NT with their suit stopped.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


AT| 

Summary of jumps after their preempts: All such jumps show GOOD hands. Make sure you and your partner know if you are using Roman Jump Overcalls to 4-of-a-minor.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


AT|

^B@2^*BMM: What Cohen calls "Roman Jump Overcalls" is also known as "Leaping Michaels" (which Howard finds more descriptive name since it shows a Michaels type 5-5 hand). Howard thinks that Leaping Michaels is a better way to play a jump to 4@C or 4@D than having it show a single suited minor hand. As Cohen suggests, this lets you play a 3-level cue bid over a weak 2 as asking for a stopper. That comes up fairly frequently and lets you get to 3NT when appropriate. The 3@H/3@S cue bid as stopper ask only applies over 2@H and 2@S openers. A 3@D cue bid over 2@D is still Michaels.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


AT|

As with any conventions, especially lesser known ones like those mentioned in the previous paragraph, please make sure you and your partner are in full agreement and will not forget what they mean. If there is any danger that one of you will forget, then you should revert to having jumps to 4@C and 4@D being natural and cue bids of 3@H and 3@S as Michaels.^*N|
