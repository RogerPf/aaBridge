qx|3p2B01,End Play  |nt||HT|E|at|^B@2^Y@3The ^*Iend play^*N|cp|8|fp|1|at|*|FP||cp||at| is perhaps the most interesting of the advanced plays in Contract Bridge. For this reason it has often been written about, and very often maltreated and given an air of complexity which it really does not deserve. Broadly speaking, the end play is but another application of a principle which is described in the elementary section (Part I) of this book - namely, that it is usually more advisable to force an Opponent to lead up to your tenace holdings than it is to lead away from those holdings yourself. This is really all there is to an end play, except that to execute this more advanced form of the situation a certain amount of preliminary sparring must be done to secure the right opening. Furthermore, the true end play, properly executed, does not give the Opponents any chance of protecting themselves.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

|cp|8|fp|1|at|*|FP||cp||at|^*I It would appear that an end play, if properly named, must occur toward the end of a hand - say at the 10th trick or later. Broadly speaking, any strategic play which takes place at the 10th trick or later might be called an end play. But the term end play by virtue of its long use in a particular sense, has come to mean just one form of play toward the end of a hand - that form of play which forces an Opponent to lead as desired by putting him in the lead when he can lead back only to the Declarer's advantage. The preparation for an end play, of course, may begin at the first trick, and, as a matter of fact, the climax may on occasion occur in the very middle of the hand.
^TSam Fry, Jr.^*N|

The end play has been given many names. It has been called ^*Ithe elimination play, the strip play, the throw-in play, the forced-lead play, etc^*N. These names are mostly variants of the same thing, and they are quite unnecessary. Some end play situations require elimination of side suits, but others do not, and such a variation can be taken care of very easily when it comes along. After all, it does not matter what the play is called just so long as the player knows how to execute it.|

Sometimes you will be right, and sometimes wrong. But if it should happen that either Opponent has the lead and must lead a heart, before any hearts have been played at all, your troubles are over. As soon as either East or West leads a heart, you no longer care which one of them has the Queen, for it is sure to be picked up. Clearly, then, it is to your advantage to place one of the Opponents in the lead - if you can do so.|

Naturally, the example just given is an invented, artificially set up situation. Yet you could plan from the beginning, or fairly early in the hand, so that such a situation might develop. You could actually make sure that the Opponents hold no more cards in any of the other suits, so that a heart lead will be the only one available to them. This requires careful planning, of course, but that is all it takes.

Consider this situation at the end of the tenth trick. |
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


AT| Suppose that the lead is now in the Dummy (North) and that you (South) must win 2 out of the 3 remaining tricks. It is true that the spade finesse offers about a fifty-fifty chance of success, but if you can avoid this chance of losing you must certainly do so. |

PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This play of the heart suit first is the elimination or strip play which is preparing for the end play. Before you can force West to lead spades, you must make sure that he holds no cards of any other suit to lead back to you. As soon as you have eliminated all other suits, the rest of the play is as easy as falling off a log.|

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%page
HT|E|at|^B@2^Y@3Y|FP||AT|ou may think it is much more difficult when an entire hand has to be stripped in preparation for an end play. It is somewhat more difficult, of course, but not really much more difficult. All that you need is enough imagination to recognize the fact that certain card combinations are bound to be more valuable to you if the Opponents can be induced to lead into them. |
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


AT|

Once you have this fact well learned, it is not such a hard matter to start the preparations for an end situation in which you leave a luckless Opponent with no choice but to lead the suit you wish. Imagination plus the ability to count up to thirteen - scarcely more than this is required to execute end plays with the touch of a master.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


AT|

The following deals illustrate different types (|fp|1|cp|8|at|*|FP||cp||at|) of end plays, but they are all of the same fundamental character.|cp|8|fp||at|" |FP||CP||AT|They all involve reaching a situation in which an Opponent can be thrown in the lead at a moment when he can lead back only what the Declarer desires.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


fp|1|cp|8|at|^B@2^Y@3*|FP||cp||at| Some writers have divided end plays into two or more classes or groups. This seems rather pointless, since there is essentially no difference between them in principle. To classify merely for the sake of classifying in Bridge is about as idle a pastime as one can imagine, though when classification aids the student there is some value to it. It is true that elimination at no-trump, in preparation for an end play, means leading out high cards, and that elimination at a suit means ruffing outside suits - but this difference is not a characteristic of end plays, but a characteristic of no-trump as contrasted with suit play.
^TSam Fry, Jr.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


AT|

Before taking up the first example, it must be emphasized that any understanding of end plays requires very careful watching of all the cards as they are played. End plays are made, as a rule, to avoid taking finesses, because they offer a better chance of success than a finesse. However, a finesse is sometimes the better play; sometimes the hand which you can throw in the lead will be one holding nothing but good tricks, and one which will never be forced to lead the suit you wish. Under such circumstances, you must prefer the finesse.|

PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West has already thrown off a diamond, has followed suit on two diamond leads, and has failed to follow suit on the third round. Therefore he held originally three diamonds - and it was previously shown that he originally held five clubs and two spades.^*N|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That means that his original hand contained three hearts, of which he has discarded one. Therefore he still holds two hearts. Furthermore, South knows that West's remaining cards consist of two clubs - exactly the Ten and nine - and two hearts, (denomination unknown). The possible end play is no longer a shot in the dark.|

This end play, which took place at the eleventh and twelfth tricks, was absolutely sure to work, because South's count on West's hand was perfect. Even if West did not hold the King of hearts, the contract was sure to be made, as West would have to lead the heart suit anyway. It is equally apparent that a heart finesse would have lost the contract, as South needed 2 heart tricks to complete his required total of 12. |
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT|^B@2
At the beginning of the hand he could see 4 sure spade tricks, 1 sure heart trick, 3 sure diamond tricks and 3 sure club tricks, 11 tricks in all. The heart Queen offered the only chance of making the twelfth trick. Finessing would have meant losing the card altogether, as East and West also held the Jack, Ten, and nine.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |

Before leaving this example deal, it should be added that West might have made things very trying for South [Let us move to the beginning of trick five when South led the spades Ace].|

West's last three cards would then have been the Ten and nine of clubs, and the singleton King of hearts. This would put the Declarer in a terrific dilemma. He would know that West held only one heart, but he would have no way of telling it was the King. The discard of the Jack might indicate that West had blanked the King of hearts, but this would not be conclusive.|

^B@2* |CP||AT|^*I It should be clear that with West holding two clubs and one heart at the eleventh trick, the end play is out. If South leads a club, West makes 2 club tricks. The dilemma South faces is whether to finesse his Queen or lay down the Ace of hearts for the drop. - Sam Fry, Jr.^*N|

The manner of playing this hand - hoping right along that West holds the club King - is common with expert players. It is colloquially termed "playing for the best chance," which means to play the hand in a way that will make the contract if the adverse cards are placed right. |
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In this deal, if East should hold the club King, the contract cannot be made anyway. South loses nothing, and has everything to gain, therefore, by playing as though the club King were placed in the West hand. His optimism was rewarded; such optimism - playing for the best chance - is really good Bridge, for it is playing to win some of the time as against always losing.|

Now there is only one heart remaining - the Queen. South has available a two-way spade finesse, but he does not know in which direction to take it, as both Opponents have assiduously refrained from discarding any spades lest they give a clue. However, South does know that whichever hand wins the third round of hearts will win it with the Queen, and that this hand will be absolutely forced to lead spades.^*N|

Of course, it may be contended that South could have guessed the finesse right - but what of that? The end play by throwing West in with a heart is much surer - in fact, it is a dead certainty. Incidentally, note West's discards. If he had only known, he might have kept an extra club, and Declarer would not then have dared to throw him in with a heart. However, in this particular deal, he would have been forced to discard a spade instead of the club, which would probably have enabled the Declarer to mark East with the Queen. |

It makes no difference whether he leads the King or a small card. Even if he held a club or a diamond, he could still not make any tricks.

In other words, the lead of a suit in which both his hands are blank, permits the Declarer to use both of two remaining trumps separately and make 2 tricks instead of 1. It is apparent that the possible play of taking two finesses in hearts will fail, as West holds both the King and the Queen.|

In taking this double finesse, South is not particularly interested in which card wins the trick. West is now in the lead and has a choice of three suits for his return - anything but a trump (hearts). Certainly a club is out of the question, for it will plunge right into Declarer's Ace-Queen tenace. A spade or a diamond amounts to the same thing - that is, they are the same in effect - so let us suppose that West returns his spade Queen.|

Trick 10. West leads @SQ, North ruffs with @HK, East plays @S10, and South discards @CQ. The Declarer ruffs in the Dummy and discards his losing club from his own hand. He now holds two trumps and the Ace of clubs - clearly the rest of the tricks are his.|
pc|sQ|pc|hK|pc|sT|NT|^B@2
Notice one thing - the Declarer must discard the club from his own hand. To discard a club from the Dummy will avail him nothing, as, even with the discard, the Dummy would still hold two clubs, one of which must lose.|

mc|12|sc|y|nt|^B@2
You have probably observed by this time that the elimination or stripping which takes place in preparing for an end play at a suit contract occurs in both Declarer's Dummy's hands - so that the suits which, at no-trump, it would be undesirable for the Opponent to lead, can be controlled by Declarer's or Dummy's remaining trumps.|
PG| ***** 230 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In this way, if the player forced to lead to the Declarer chooses to avoid the suit in which the Declarer holds a tenace over him, he must lead a suit of which the Declarer and Dummy are void, thereby enabling the Declarer to ruff in one hand and to throw off from the other hand that subordinate part of the tenace which a lead in that suit would have enabled him to win. |
PG| ***** 231 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In other words, an end play at a suit contract is slightly more complex only in that it permits the Declarer to benefit even when the tenaced suit is not led. The player thrown in the lead has to lead into a tenace or lead a suit which will give the Declarer a ruff and a discard.|uP|40|pf|Y|sc||nt|

Trick 2. North leads @H5, East plays @H2, South ruffs with @S8, and West plays @H8. Note that the Declarer starts stripping hearts even before drawing trumps. This is not absolutely necessary, but by doing this he makes sure that he will not lose his tempo.|

Declarer could, of course, ruff the heart King, but if he does so the success of his contract will still depend on the club finesse. He therefore throws off the club which he must lose later anyway, in order to make sure that West will have to lead up to him. Note that this play renders West as helpless as a baby.|
PG| ***** 265 ***** |


NT|^B@2
To lead a heart permits South to discard his losing eight of clubs (as he did in the last trick), while the club lead eliminates another club loser since it enables South's tenace to win. Of course, the play would not work if the Declarer did not first remove the low hearts from the Dummy. This is absolutely essential.|

The Declarer now stops to consider. He has lost 1 trick already, and is sure to lose at least 2 more tricks (in hearts).

Here East is thrown in the lead for an end play at the seventh trick. He holds no more spades and no more hearts. A diamond lead eliminates the finesse in this suit and a club lead permits the Declarer to discard a diamond.|

South really did not think he would succeed when he made this play, but he simply took advantage of this extra possibility. The hearts have to be lost anyway, so why not lose them at once? The missing trump is not at all dangerous and can just as well be left alone for a while.|

The principal characteristic of this end play, which also has something of the glamour of the coup, is that the player thrown in the lead, instead of being forced to lead into Declarer's tenace or to lead a suit providing Declarer with a ruff and a discard, is forced to lead a suit of which both Partner and Dummy are void, so that poor West is obliged to ruff under the Dummy's Ace of trumps.|

PG| ***** 368 ***** |


AT|

An end play, as the term is used by the majority of writers on Bridge and related games, occurs when an Opponent is put in the lead at a time when he can lead back only to the Declarer's advantage. The "Declarer's advantage" may be any one of a number of situations. |
PG| ***** 369 ***** |


AT|

The Opponent may be forced to lead into a tenace, thus destroying the value of his own guarded honor or honors, or |
PG| ***** 370 ***** |


AT|

he may be forced to lead a suit which the Declarer can ruff in one hand and throw off on in the other. |
PG| ***** 371 ***** |


AT|

Only the first type of end play - that which forces an Opponent to lead into a tenace - is possible at a no-trump contract. At a suit contract, both kinds just mentioned are possible, and one or two variations. |
PG| ***** 372 ***** |


AT|

One rare sort of end play occurs when an Opponent is forced to lead a suit of which both his Partner and one of the Declarer's hands is void, so that Partner is forced to trump under the Declarer's commanding trumps.|
PG| ***** 373 ***** |


AT|

A certain amount of preparation is necessary for most end plays. This preparation consists of |
PG| ***** 374 ***** |


AT|

eliminating those suits which it is not desirable for the Opponent to return when he is thrown in the lead. Often, when the end play is designed to give the Declarer a ruff and a discard, the elimination is from the Declarer's partnership hands instead of from the hand of the Opponent who is to be thrown in.|
