qx|92B01,|nt||HT|e|at|^B@2^Y@3This miscellany of advanced plays and playing principles is thrown  together here because the examples included do not fit into any other category. They illustrate situations that occur rather frequently and that require special treatment. The reader must not get the notion that this Chapter is not important; the situations dealt with here are vital, but the fact that they cannot be grouped logically with other types of plays simply goes to show that the subject of the play of the hand is peculiarly difficult of classification and codification.|

For Declarer to hold up here can do no harm and it may save the contract. After the Ten of spades is allowed to hold the second trick,|PC|s6s4h2|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


AT| it makes no difference whether West later holds off or not, as East will be exhausted of the suit. In other words, the Declarer, by holding up on the second trick, will lose only 3 spade tricks and 1 club trick.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The hand just given also [Board 2 is reloaded] has another interesting point. If East had played the Ten of spades instead of the Ace on the first trick,|UP|6|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


pc|st|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


AT| South would have been put in a bad spot. If South thought East was deliberately holding back either the Ace or the King, he should duck, of course. However, if both the Ace and the King should be in the West hand, the duck will be a losing play as East can come through the Declarer twice.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, the Ten of spades on the first trick is an almost impossible play for East to make, since West might be leading from the King-Jack, when the Ten simply loses a trick to an unguarded Queen. Taking everything into consideration, the play of the Ten by East is a little far-fetched, but with the play of the Ace on the first trick the subsequent play by the Declarer was marked.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Another variation of a hold-up, which is an exception to a rule learned in Part I, occurs when you are desirous of keeping a certain hand out of the lead. The following deal illustrates a hold-up when the King and Queen are divided between two hands:|

PG| ***** 39 ***** |


AT| As explained in Part I, Declarer's best chance of obtaining 2 tricks in spades lies in going up with the Queen in Dummy. In this particular case, however, he is not interested in 2 spade tricks. All he wants to do is to keep West out of the lead. If he plays the Queen and East eventually obtains the lead with the King of diamonds, the King in his own hand will be led through and captured. He should therefore play low from the Dummy|pc|s5st|

NT|^B@2
In order to make 9 tricks, he must establish both diamonds and hearts, and he must therefore guess which Ace is held by which Opponent. If he should win the first spade trick, and decide in favor of starting diamonds, East will be able to return the spade suit and West will eventually obtain the lead with the Ace of hearts and set the contract.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It is true that if South should start to establish hearts first, he can still make his contract, but this is nothing but a guess, pure and simple. The hold-up on the first trick can lose only if West held five spades originally and |CP|8|AT|both|CP||AT| Aces, in which case the hand cannot be made anyway. |

lb|*mWhich suit should South play first - clubs (finesse) or diamonds?^Diamonds~Clubs^1|AT| His first impulse is to take his club finesse, but a simple count of the tricks which are available to him will show him that such a precipitate course is wrong.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If the club finesse works, he can run off 9 tricks without bothering about the diamond suit, but if the club finesse loses, he will have only 8 tricks, and the spades will be established against him before the Ace of diamonds is put out of the fight. If East holds the diamond Ace, all will still be well, but if it should lie in the West hand and if West held five spades originally, the diamond Ace will defeat the Declarer. The point is that Declarer must make sure of 1 diamond trick at once.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT|^B@2
At the third trick, therefore, South leads a low diamond, and the trick will probably be won with Dummy's Ten.|PC|d3d6dtd2|

pg| ***** 65 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Note that the play cannot possibly lose. Leading the diamond first simply provides against a 5-3 distribution of spades. If the spades are adversely divided 4-4, the Declarer cannot lose more than 4 tricks anyway.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


AT| Note also that immediately taking the club finesse allows East and West to set the contract, as East can knock out South's last spade stopper upon obtaining the lead with the club King, and West will simply retain two good spades and his Ace of diamonds for the last 3 tricks.|

sk|S|NT||at|^B@2^Y@3It is at once apparent that the success or failure of the contract depends on diamond suit, and that the finesse against the King seems to be the only chance. However, does the actual finesse really matter? If West holds the King and is allowed to take a trick with it he will not be able to lead spades to his partner's established suit, as was proved by his opening of the six-spot (this marks East with @s K Q J T 9, and three rounds have been played). If East holds it the contract is lost anyway - unless he holds it alone!|

HT|E|CS|1|cp|4|AT|^-{    "DOUBLE DUMMY" PLAYING PROBLEMS    }
^-|CS||cp||FP||AT|^B@2^Y@3This is perhaps as good a spot as any to insert a word or two about so-called "Double Dummy" problems in contract Bridge. You will frequently run across problem hands in magazines, in advertising matter, and so on, in which you are given a theoretical situation requiring the making of a Grand Slam, let us say. You are supposed to solve the problem while looking at ^*Iall four hands^*N. Since the problem is really difficult, even with all four hands exposed, it becomes something quite alien to the ordinary play of the game.|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


AT|

Although it is true that in the examples used in this book the four hands are usually exposed, all being printed, necessarily, in plain sight on the page, there are no real "Double Dummy" problems|CP|8|AT|^*B* ^*N|CP||AT|among them. Every hand presents a situation which can be logically analyzed by a player who sees only his own cards and those in the Dummy that are exposed in regular Bridge. 

|CP|8|at|^*B* ^*N|CP||AT|The "Double Dummy" problem came to be so called from the whist game of Double Dummy, a variant of ordinary Whist, intended for two persons, each with an exposed or dummy hand for a partner. In the actual Double Dummy bridge problem, there are really four dummies, or, if you like, one player and three dummies,for the one player manages all the hands to arrive at a solution which will work against any possible defense by the opposing side. Many difficult Double Dummy problems involves fantastic squeeze plays, discards, etc., which could not by any stretch of the imagination ever be planned by the world's most masterly player if he could not always see all four hands. - Sam Fry, Jr.|
PG| ***** 165 ***** |

A Double Dummy problem hand really does not teach Bridge tactics at all. It is on a par with an end game in chess, or with a problem in algebra. You can manipulate the cards any way you like to reach a solution, the only requirement being that you lead and follow suit as in the actual game of Bridge. Otherwise the Double Dummy problem does not even remotely resemble Bridge. Such tactics as safety plays, deception, and counting have no possible place.|

HT|E|CS|1|cp|4|AT|^-{    "DOUBLE DUMMY" PLAYING PROBLEMS - Continued    }
^-|CS||cp||FP||AT|^B@2^Y@3A|FP||AT| careful line must be drawn, then, between the Double Dummy problem, as such, and the printed Bridge hand which, for lack of any other way of presenting the deal to a single reader at a time, shows all  four hands also. The Bridge hand intended as an example of actual play requires a wholly different approach on the part of the reader. In seeking to get the greatest benefit from an example hand, such as those printed in this book and those printed in daily newspaper articles on Contract Bridge, the reader should look only at his own hand, putting himself in the place of but one player at the table, and try to deduce from his own thirteen cards and the Dummy (as soon as it is exposed - after the opening lead has been made) what ^*Ihe^*N would do if he were confronted with this situation in actual play.|
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


AT| 

To this end it may prove advantageous to cover the two hands which  would be concealed in normal play. After a plan of play has been made in this fashion, the reader's perspicuity can then be checked with reference to the covered hands, and to the explanatory text.|
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


AT|

This note on Double Dummy or exposed hands is appended here chiefly to dispel a prevalent notion that Bridge experts claim to be miracle workers. Many average players have seen certain Double Dummy hands, and have been frankly skeptical that even the greatest player in the world could solve them - without seeing all the cards. If the hand is really a Double Dummy problem, and correspondingly intricate, the skeptical readers are perfectly right. In fact, there are many expert Bridge players who are not at all adept at working out Double Dummy problems, and who, if the truth must be told, do not care to become any better at it, for the very good reason that the technique is entirely different from actual play. |
PG| ***** 169 ***** |

There are also a number of good Double Dummy experts, who are "puzzle solvers" at heart, but who are about average when it comes to the contest of wits in an honest-to-goodness rubber.

QX|92DS,DUPLICATE STRATEGY|HT|e|cs|1|cp|4|fp||at|^-{    DUPLICATE STRATEGY    }
^-|cp||FP||at|^B@2^Y@3T|FP||AT|he differences between play at Duplicate Bridge and play at Rubber Bridge are not as great as the differences in bidding. 

Play at team-of-four matches, which are always scored at total points, is approximately the same as at Rubber Bridge, but match point play for pairs, either by the Howell or the Mitchell method, is sometimes quite different. For example, a player who has reached a contract of four spades might on occasion risk getting set when his bid is assured, merely for the sake of obtaining an extra trick. This extra trick, which counts only 30 points in regular Bridge, can very easily give him a top score on the board. |
PG| ***** 171 ***** |


AT|

This is not generally good policy, however, and a play of this type should not be made unless the percentages are very much in favor of its success, or unless the pair has so bad a score at the moment that very desperate measures are required. With a good score, the tendency should be to play for average and let the other pairs worry about the tops.|
PG| ***** 172 ***** |


AT|

The other main difference revolves around the fact that a pair is often liable to get into the wrong contract. For instance, suppose that you found yourself at one no-trump and saw immediately that the hand was a lay-down for three hearts. If it seemed that most other teams would play the hand at hearts, you would then be forced to try desperate means to make - not two no-trump, as this would count only 70 as against the 90 produced by three hearts - but three no-trump!|
PG| ***** 173 ***** |


AT|

Even if you went down in the process, this loss would probably involve very few match points. However, if the hand were such that it seemed likely that most pairs would reach four hearts and go down one, then the best thing to do would be to play safe and assure yourself of a plus score. 

So far as technique - attack or defense - is concerned, it is the same in Duplicate Bridge as in Rubber Bridge.|

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Summary
qx|92SUM,Summary|HT|e|CS|1|CP|4|AT|^-{    Summary    }
^-|CS||CP||FP||AT|^B@2^Y@3N|FP||AT|ot much can be said in summarizing this chapter, since the points involved depend so greatly on the specific instance. You were told that a hold-up of a King-Queen or a Queen-Jack suit might occasionally prove profitable, when there is a specific reason for so doing. You were shown the advantage, or rather the necessity, sometimes, of establishing a trick in a short suit, at no-trump, before proceeding to the more lucrative business of setting up a long suit. You were informed that an Ace-King suit should be held up under certain circumstances, to eliminate a guess. And, contrary to the rules laid down in Part I, it had demonstrated to you the occasional value of deliberately leading into an adverse tenace - to prevent the Declarer establishing a suit before your own setting trick was in sight, or to establish a suit which otherwise could not be set up.|
PG| ***** 175 ***** |


AT|

The time element was a vital factor in practically all of these situations. You were also shown a rather spectacular example of trumping your partner's Ace, and a less spectacular, but perhaps more valuable case, where a chance of dropping a singleton King was taken just for a little bit of extra safety.|
PG| ***** 176 ***** |


AT|

The principal lesson of the Chapter should be that a good player always looks about him before he plunges ahead with his play. He tries to see whether normal play will make his contract, and, if not, he casts about for something which, even if a departure from the normal, may give him a chance. Very often playing for the only chance will not result in victory, but the fact that it fails is no worse a blow than certain defeat without such an attempt being made, and the fact that it occasionally succeeds is ample reward for perceiving the possibility.|
