nt||HT|e|cp||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3U|FP||AT|nlike defense against no-trump contracts, when Partner's lead should almost always be returned, suit defense offers quite a field for the imagination of the individual player.

Against suit contracts other considerations must be taken into account.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


AT|

When one suit is predominant, or, in other words, when it is trump, the time element tends to militate against the Defending Side. At no-trump, tricks can very often be sacrificed immediately for the later good of the entire hand; at a suit, no sacrifice can be made without a reason which will prove important within a few tricks. |
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT|

The cause of this, of course, is the trump suit, which is always liable to take control of the whole hand. A shift to a suit other than Partner's, therefore, is frequently not only advisable but necessary, and any postponement of the play is liable to render it completely ineffective later.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


AT|

Take, for example, the following deal, where a lead through strength must be made immediately because of the danger that the trump suit will interrupt future defensive activities:|

PG| ***** 12 ***** |


at| If you were playing against a no-trump contract, you would be in no trouble in deciding on your proper return; you would simply lead back a diamond. Since spades are trumps, however, you see immediately that the diamond lead will accomplish nothing constructive, even if Partner can win the trick.|

NT|^B@2
He will be obliged to lead to the third trick and will not be able to play any card which can advance your combined cause in the slightest.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


AT| What is your best chance of defeating the four spade contract? Obviously Partner's spade or club tricks (if any) will make, no matter what you do or what you lead.  |
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Your one chance of capitalizing on the fact that you are in the lead lies in the heart suit - perhaps you can strike Partner with some combination of cards in this suit which must be led up to. You therefore abandon the diamond suit and switch to the deuce of hearts. This enables Partner to make both his Ace and Queen of hearts, in addition to his diamond King.|

If you had continued the diamond suit, it is obvious that Declarer would have made his contract. Partner, unable to lead from the Ace-Queen of hearts, would probably have shifted to clubs, and Declarer would have been able to discard one of his heart losers on the long clubs in Dummy.|

Sometimes, as in the above shown deal, a shift of the same type must be made when you know that Partner holds a second round winner in the suit opened and you do not dare trust him to shift suits immediately. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You are again East, defending against a contract of five diamonds, and|MB|5dppp|at| Partner opens the King of spades.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


PC|sk|at| You must pause to consider the situation. Regardless of anything else you are bound to win a trick in trumps. One spade trick can probably be counted on, but can you make 2?|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If so, well and good, but if Declarer should happen to hold a singleton spade he will ruff your Partner's second lead. You may still obtain a club trick later, but there is a chance that Declarer holds only one club loser and, if so, the fourth heart in Dummy looks awfully dangerous and may easily be a card which can be used for discarding purposes.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You must therefore overtake Partner's King of spades with your Ace |

PG| ***** 28 ***** |


PC|ck|SK||at| This insures the defeat of the contract, as you must regain the lead with your Ace of trumps and you can then cash in your good Queen of clubs. |
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Note that, if you had failed to do this and Partner had continued a spade at the second trick, your Ace of diamonds would have been driven out before your club trick was established and the losing club in Declarer's hand would have been discarded on the fourth heart in Dummy. Thus the contract would have been made.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This overtaking play in order to shift can lose nothing. If it develops later that Declarer actually held another spade, this trick is still not lost; it can be cashed in after the setting trick (in clubs) has been taken.|

The shift to another suit also occurs frequently when Third Hand sees a chance to develop ruffing power. The presence of a doubleton or a singleton in the hand should suggest immediately the chance of establishing a trick by shortening yourself. |

Take this deal, in which you are sitting East, defending against a contract of four hearts played by South.|

Ordinarily this would be a lay-down, as it seems as though the Declarer and his Partner can lose only 3 tricks - two in spades and one in clubs. However, proper defense will actually defeat the hand by 2 tricks. Your Partner opens the King of spades,|pc|SK|

The same principle can also work out very well if applied to doubletons, as in this deal.|

PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The club situation is obviously hopeless and a trump lead is little short of senseless. There remains one chance. If you can shorten yourself sufficiently in hearts, you may be able to defeat the contract by developing a ruffing-trick.|

Another time when Partner's suit should not be returned is when an honor in the Dummy threatens to become established for a discard. For example, take this deal, in which you are again sitting East and defending against a four heart contract:|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


pc|s6|at| Your Partner (West) opens the six of spades and when Dummy plays low|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


pc|s5|at| you win the trick with the Ace, as you have no finessing possibilities. |PC|sas9|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You see at once that a return in this suit will establish Dummy's Queen, and so you look around for other means of defense. Of course the diamond suit is the most obvious, and so you shift to the Ten of diamonds.|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


PC|dt|SK||at| No matter what card Declarer plays, he can not avoid losing 2 diamond tricks and 1 more spade trick, and he is therefore set 1 trick.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Obviously, the spade return enables him to get rid of one of his losing diamonds before his Ace is driven out.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |

There are many hands which call for but a temporary shift; that is to say, Partner's suit is actually continued but not until you have given him some information as to your hand. For example in this deal,|MB|3hppp|pc|sk|
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


at| your partner opens the King of spades against South's three heart contract. You should overtake with the Ace,|PC|s3sas8|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


at| in order to lay down the King of diamonds. |PC|dkd5d3d2|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now you return a spade and Partner comes back with a diamond through Dummy's Queen.|PC|S7s9sts5|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


SK||PC|d9d4djd6|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


sc|y|sk||
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


at| If the spade were returned immediately, Partner would be forced to guess whether to lead clubs or diamonds. If he happened to choose clubs, the contract would be made, as Declarer could get rid of a diamond in Dummy on the long club in his own hand.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||sc||
st||sk|E|MD|SJ8HAKQJ9DQJ5CKQ6,SKQT5H85D9864CT72,S97H632DKT732CA95,SA6432HT74DACJ843|RH||AH|Board 7|NT|^B@2
Another similar case is shown here.|MB|4hppp|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


AT| Your Partner (West) opens the King of spades against South's four heart contract.|PC|SK|
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


AT| This card you must overtake with the Ace,|PC|s9sas8|
pg| ***** 75 ***** |


at| and lay down the Ace of diamonds.|PC|DAd5d4d2|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


cp||AT| Now when you return the spade, your Partner cannot mistake your meaning, and must return a second round of diamonds which you ruff for the setting trick.|PC|s3sjsqs7|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


PC|D9d3h4|sk||
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


CP||NT|^B@2
These examples cover about all of the probable occasions for failing to return Partner's lead against a suit contract, which have not already been discussed under Continuation Plays. However, these opportunities will present themselves in many guises, and every situation must be weighed separately. Be sure to remember this - if the return of Partner's suit seems pointless, try to find some better lead. Nevertheless, make sure that to return Partner's lead really is pointless!|

^-{    SUMMARY    }
^-|CS||CP||AT|^B@2^Y@3I|AT|n this short but important Chapter you learned that it pays to shift suits at trump contracts more often than it does at no-trump contracts. Sometimes the reason may be that you must lead through strength immediately, and other times it may be because you wish control of the second lead yourself. You must also watch for any possible ruffing power, and be ready to develop it if you see a chance to do so.  |
