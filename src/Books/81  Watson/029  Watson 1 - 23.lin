qx|23B01,OPENING LEADS AGAINST A SUIT CONTRACT|
NT||HT|E|cp||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3T|FP||AT|he time has come to abandon temporarily the subject of defense against a no-trump contract and consider some of the aspects of defense against a suit contract. Of course, the majority of the principles taken up in discussing defensive play against no-trump apply with equal force to defensive play against suit contracts. However, some modification has occasionally to be made to fit the conditions when one suit (the trump suit) is of greater trick-taking power than the other three. Also, quite a number of new principles will be introduced.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

The proper place to start is again with the opening lead. This is the first shot fired by the Defending Side, and the best possible effort should be made to have it take effect. Strangely enough, the opening lead against a suit contract does not greatly differ from that against no-trump. |
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|

The same conventions, in general, are still effective. The lead of a Queen still tells Partner that the leader has the Jack, and the lead of a King promises the Queen or the Ace. Also, the lead of a low card is usually to be regarded as the fourth best from a long suit, so that the Rule of Eleven can be used by Partner. However, the order of preference in opening leads against a suit varies somewhat from that against no-trump, because the conditions of play differ.

^-{    THE MOST DESIRABLE LEADS AGAINST A SUIT CONTRACT    }
^-|cp|8|at|^B@2^Y@3The best opening lead of all is undoubtedly the lead of the King from an Ace-King holding|cp||at|. This lead is not only almost certain to win the first round, but it permits you to see the Dummy before you take your next step in planning your defense. Against no-trump, it is usually better to lead away from Ace-King combinations to facilitate development of long-suit tricks. Defending against a suit, however, you cannot waste time thinking about long-suit tricks, for by the time you develop any the Declarer or Dummy will be exhausted of the suit and able to trump in.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|

Unlike no-trump defense, suit defense does not involve waiting around to take tricks. The best policy is almost always to grab what you can, and run - hoping, naturally, that what you can grab will be enough to set the contract.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


CP|8|AT|

Perhaps the next best lead against a suit is a singleton, or the top card of a doubleton, in the suit bid by Partner (if he bid a suit)|cp||at|. This lead has several advantages. The fact that Partner has bid the suit indicates that he must have some strength in it, showing that he will either be able to win the first round or perhaps the second or third round. Furthermore, such a lead immediately shortens your own hand and puts you in the position of being able to ruff either the second or third round of that suit. The singleton lead is better than the doubleton because Partner need hold only the Ace to make the lead a strategic success.|

^-{    THE MOST DESIRABLE LEADS AGAINST A SUIT CONTRACT - Continued    }
^-|CS||cp||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3T|FP||AT|he third best lead against a suit is already familiar to you. It is called, you remember, |cp|8|at|the honor-sequence lead|cp||at|, such as the King from King-Queen, the Queen from Queen-Jack or the Jack from Jack-Ten. Here again you perceive a difference between no-trump and suit defense. In no-trump defense the honor-sequence lead is most effective when the suit also has length; in suit defense, the lead is usually more likely to produce results when the suit contains only three cards.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


AT|

The reason for this is not far to seek. The more cards of a suit you hold, the fewer your Opponents will hold, and consequently the greater risk you run of being ruffed. The shorter your suit, the greater chance you have of making tricks before the Declarer can ruff.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


AT|

There is another slight modification of the no-trump honor-sequence lead. Against no-trump it is customary to prefer the honor lead to a length lead only when three honors in sequence (or two honors in sequence with the third card only one step removed) are held. |
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


AT|

Against a suit, this is not true. Holding either K Q x x or Q J x x, your proper lead is the top honor - not the low card. The element of time is so much more important in suit defense that this is an important difference.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


AT|

You cannot afford to gamble on setting up a winner for the third or fourth round, because such winners exist only in rare distributions. Whatever tricks you win with high cards against a suit contract must be taken on the first or second rounds of the suit, as a rule. This also explains why the lead of the King from K Q x is desirable against a suit but undesirable against no-trump.|

^-|
cp||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3O|FP||AT|ther good leads against a suit contract cannot be ranked in order of preference, since this is practically impossible, owing to the variety of conditions which may arise. The bidding is an important factor which cannot be allowed for in any set rule. The individual player will have to use his own best judgment, taking into consideration all the knowledge that he possesses.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


AT|

There is the lead of Partner's bid suit when more than a doubleton is held. This may be a very good lead, in that it starts constructive defense. The only question is the choice of the particular card in that suit, which happens not to be very difficult.|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


AT|

With four or more cards in Partner's bid suit, |FP|2|cp|8|at|you should always lead the fourth best|cp||FP||at|, the only exception being that the Queen should be led from Q J x x, and the Ace should be led from A x x x.|cp||
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


at|

With three cards the choice is less simple, and there is much difference of opinion among expert players which lead is likely to work out to the best advantage. If the three cards are headed by the Ten or some lower card, it is universally agreed that the highest of the three cards should always be led.|va|2|cp|8|FP|1|at|*|cp||FP||at| But if the tripleton in Partner's suit is headed by a card higher than the Ten, opinion is divided. |

va|4|cp|8|FP|1|at|*|cp||FP||at| See Chapter XII, Part II, for a further discussion of this subject. - Sam Fry, Jr.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


AT|

The writer has found that the Jack from J x x and the Ace from A x x are good leads; and that the lowest card from K x x or Q x x seems the most desirable. The decision is a close one, but with K x x or Q x x it seems fairly evident that the honor should be retained, either for an entry later on or to kill any honor which may be held by the Declarer. Since the Jack in J x x cannot be expected to serve either purpose, it may as well be led. And to lead away from the Ace in A x x is far too dangerous a lead to toy with. Of course, when a doubleton is held originally, the higher of the two cards should be led, honor or no honor. |

cp||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3S|FP||AT|hort-suit leads against a suit are about the most paradoxical of all opening leads. If they succeed, they are crowned with glory, but if they fail, they deserve only ashes. When a short-suit lead fails to click, it may lose more than 1 trick, which is a dismal result. The advantage of a short-suit lead lies in the fact that the leader's hand is shortened and thereby is nearer to ruffing power. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


AT|

The chief disadvantage of such a lead lies in the fact that its significance is very easily read by the Declarer, so that he can immediately place all the missing honors in that suit in the hand of the leader's Partner. The card reading may do the Declarer no good, and if so the lead does no harm in that deal, but it may frequently be the very information the Declarer needs to enable him to make his contract.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


AT|

Many players like to lead a low (worthless) singleton, or the top of a worthless doubleton. Curiously enough, experience has shown that the worthless doubleton is a better lead than the worthless singleton. The reason is that the doubleton lead can be read with less facility by the Declarer, while it still offers almost as much of a chance of developing ruffing power in the leader's hand. Furthermore, a small card is retained which may be of use in getting over to Partner's hand.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


AT|

A player's trump holding is frequently the determining factor in choosing between an ordinary length lead and a short-suit lead. |cp|8|at|Strangely enough, the more trumps you hold the less inclined you should be to open a short suit|cp||at|. With four or more trumps your object should be to try to reduce the number of Declarer's trumps, and so it is better to choose some long suit which may eventually compel him to ruff, thereby bringing him nearer your level. This will be explained more fully in the Chapter on Forcing the Declarer.|

cp||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3W|FP||AT|hen you hold only two or three trumps, especially when they are headed by an honor which may easily turn out to be an entry, the short-suit lead is often a very successful maneuver.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


cp|8|at|

A short-suit lead from any holding containing a single honor should usually be avoided. Preserve as long as possible combinations like Ace-small, King-small, Queen-small, and Jack-small|cp||at|, as they are bound to prove more valuable if the suits in which they are held are first led by the Declarer. Occasionally the Ace may be led from Ace-small in order to develop ruffing power when no other lead is available, but as a general rule it should be eschewed. The Jack from Jack-small is also a possible lead on occasion, but the King-small and Queen-small combinations should be opened only when the situation is very desperate.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


AT|

A lead of a singleton honor is just about as undesirable, with the possible exception of the singleton Ace. To lead a singleton Ace gives you ruffing power in that suit immediately while you still retain the lead. |cp|8|at|To lead a singleton King can only be described as dreadful|cp||at|, while a singleton Queen lead is not much better. The latter may sometimes be led as a desperation lead, but the King can almost never be. |cp|8|at|A singleton Jack, on the other hand, is sometimes a very desirable lead|cp||at|.|

cp||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3A|FP||AT|s for leading the top of two honors in sequence, this is really a pretty good lead. The King from King-Queen alone or the Queen from Queen-Jack alone are both very desirable, since they offer good foundations for later defensive play. The top card is usual, even from Ace-King alone, when the conventional opening is the Ace followed by the King on the second round. Whenever the opening lead of the Ace is immediately followed by the King on the next round, Partner knows that you hold no more cards of that suit, as this play is a reversal of the normal procedure when holding an Ace-King combination. He thus is informed of your ruffing power.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


AT|

The simple or plain length lead, so common in no-trump defense, is also fairly common in suit defense, especially when no better lead is available. To lead fourth best from K x x x, Q x x x, J x x x or 10 x x x, at least stands a chance of promoting honors in Partner's hand, and may develop second- or third-round winners immediately. You may be surprised to see K x x x included here, for you have probably been told by some wiseacre that you should "^*Inever^*N lead away from a King." |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


AT|

Such advice is fantastic. Admittedly it is not usually a very desirable lead, but sometimes it is very necessary. The lead away from the lower honors is less dangerous, but the lead away from the lone King has the compensational advantage of the time element. A trick can be established with this lead more quickly than with any of the others if Partner holds but one high honor, namely, either the Ace or the Queen.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


AT|

To lead fourth best from A x x x, however, is usually ill-advised, as to do so may lose a trick to Declarer's or Dummy's singleton King, especially when the leader holds more than four cards topped by the Ace. However, in certain desperate situations, such a lead must be made. These desperate cases will be described later.|

cp||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3Y|FP||AT|ou may also recall that the top card from a worthless tripleton was mentioned as a possible lead against no-trump. This lead is good against no-trump only when the leader's hand is otherwise quite worthless. Against a suit contract, such a lead - top of a worthless tripleton - is more advantageous when the rest of the hand is quite strong. The worthless suit is deliberately chosen to let the leader retain untouched his tenace combinations in the other three suits.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


AT|

Tenace combinations, which should not, as a rule, be led away from, include A Q x, K J x, A J x, A 10 x, and the like. For this reason, the lead of the top of a worthless tripleton is rather more common in suit than in no-trump defense. In fact, such a lead is better than any card from A x, A x x, or A x x x.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


AT|

Finally, there is the lead of the Declarer's trump suit. When it is apparent from the bidding that the chief strength of the Declarer's hands depends on Dummy's ruffing power, the time element becomes of prime importance, and the Defending Side must make the most of the fact that they have the first move. You might quite reasonably change your mind if you could see the Dummy first, but that first lead may very often be vital. This trump lead is not common, but it must be mentioned here as a possibility, since it is sometimes imperative. A later Chapter is entirely devoted to the subject of killing Dummy's ruffing power.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


AT|

The Declarer's trump suit may also be selected for the opening lead when the bidding has shown that the Declarer and Dummy hold all the strength in their bid suit. This means that to lead a trump cannot possibly injure Partner's hand. When no other desirable opening is available, the trump may be led under these circumstances.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


AT|

As you gain in knowledge of suit defense, you will find it easier to judge which of all possible opening leads you have in your hand is the best.

Obviously you cannot open the trump suit; as this will almost certainly sacrifice a trick. Clubs and diamonds are both possible leads, but both run the risk of shooting right into an opposing tenace situation. |
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It is true that hearts have been bid on your left, but they have not been supported - in fact, South showed little enthusiasm after hearing his Partner's heart take-out, but jumped to game over his second response. It would seem, therefore, as though South must not have much of a fit in hearts, and since North has never rebid the suit, the balance of strength must be with East. Your best opening, therefore, is a heart.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you held an honor in the suit, such as the King or Queen, the principle would not apply. Then you would be better advised to open from one of your tenaces and hope for the best.|

NT|^B@2
In no-trump contracts, a lead of this type should not be employed unless you are certain that the suit has been denied. A mere no-trump rebid does not imply a denial, as more often than not the opening bidder will hold a fit in his Partner's suit.|
