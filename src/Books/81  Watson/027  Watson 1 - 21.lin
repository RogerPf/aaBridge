A modern interpretation of leads and discards has been given. In all of these instances the Defending Side were attacking the Declarer, for the most part - either leading or making some preparation for a future lead. As a matter of fact, the Defending Side attack with comparative rarity. By far the greater part of the time the Defending Side are following suit to Declarer's leads and either winning or refusing to win these tricks.|

The problem of the defensive player in the fourth position - that is, Fourth Hand in playing to a trick, after the other three players have already played - is not very difficult. Most of the time it is fairly easy for Fourth Hand to see when he should win the trick, if he can, and when he should refuse to win it.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |

The problem of the defensive player in the second position - he who plays Second Hand to a trick - is much less simple, for either the Dummy and Partner still have to play, or the Declarer and Partner still have to play. In other words, when you are Second Hand to a trick, there are still two chances left for someone else to win the trick after you play. The defensive play of Second Hand resolves itself into two categories:|

cp||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3P|FP||AT|laying defensively before the Dummy is no more difficult than playing before the Declarer, for you see not only your own cards but those in the Dummy. Nine times out of ten the Dummy's holding in the led suit will furnish the clue for Second Hand's proper play. Against no-trump contracts, particularly, it is no great problem for Second Hand to find the correct defense.|

There is an old Whist maxim that Second Hand should play low  - |cp|8|at|"Second Hand low"|cp||at| - which is analogous to that other one already discussed (|cp|8|at|"Third Hand high"|cp||at|). This saying has a lot of truth in it, in spite of the fact that it was at one time much overdone in the observance. The formula is still good, but it must be phrased somewhat differently, as follows: ^*IPlay low Second Hand unless there is some good reason for doing otherwise.^*N|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |

The most obvious situation for playing Second Hand low occurs when the play of a high card will certainly sacrifice a trick. The following distribution illustrates the point.|

cp||fp||at|^B@2^z@3T|FP||AT|he point underlying all this discussion is that a defensive player should almost never try to win a trick which does not contain some honor originally belonging to either Declarer or Dummy. If you win a trick with an Ace on which everyone around the table has a chance to throw off small cards, the full value of that Ace is depreciated by half.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


AT|

You remember the promotional value of honors - that every time two honors fall on one trick an honor directly below becomes promoted in rank. This is what happens when, in the preceding example, you refuse to take your Ace until you can capture Declarer's Queen with it. |cp|8|at|Always play an Ace, if possible, in such a way that it will capture at least one opposing honor|cp||at|.|

|HT|Q|at|^D  @H Q 9 5 |HT|O|AT|^I@2^3@3Look at the preceding example once again. The most foolish play of all would be the Ten. To be sure, the Ten will, you might say, force Dummy's Jack - but why do that? It is presumably the Declarer's ^*Iintention^*N to play Dummy's Jack when he leads his five-spot, and your play of a low card is not going to change his mind.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


HT|r|AT|^B@2^Z@3

Playing to "|cp|8|at|force out|cp||at|" a higher card for no reason at all is a weakness of some players. They feel that they have gained something if the Ten, in the last example, does force out Dummy's Jack, when actually they have succeeded only in losing the Ten. Besides, even supposing that, in a rare instance, the Jack will not be played from Dummy regardless of what you do, what about your Partner? He is likely to have at least one high card now and then, and he must be allowed full opportunity to take advantage of the situation if Declarer plays low from the Dummy also.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


AT|

Following is another simple example of the necessity for playing low in the position of Second Hand:|

st||sk||pn|Declarer,,Dummy,|md|4S875,Skj9,Saqt2,S643|HA|Y|rh||ah|Diagram 3|ah|Plays by Second Hand|sv||wt|S|NT|^B@2
Here Second Hand (West) is in a finessing position when the Declarer leads the five. You, as West, must play your nine. The play of either the King or the Jack merely simplifies the Declarer's play - in fact, it will place for him all the missing honors in your hand. By playing the nine you may induce the Declarer to finesse Dummy's Queen on the first round, thereby making your King-Jack worth 1 sure trick.|

A sequence changes the outlook, thus:|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


AT|

Here it is advisable, when West is Second Hand, to play for the certainty of making 1 trick. If Declarer leads low you, as West, should play the Jack, which forces the Ace and leaves you with a sure third round winner. Notice carefully the difference between this and the preceding situations. Here the play of the Jack is right because of the threatening Ten in the Dummy. |

st||sk||md|4d4,dqj7,da832,d-|rh||ah|Diagram 5|ah|Plays by Second Hand|sv||NT|^B@2
Now it would be dangerous for West to play the Jack, as the chances are against the Declarer's holding @d K 10 9 4. The danger in playing the Jack lies in the fact that to do so might conceivably force Dummy's Ace and drop Partner's singleton King.|

Put another way, with the Dummy holding @d A 8 3 2, the chances are pretty good that Partner holds either the King or the Ten, and to play low will force Dummy's Ace just as surely as to play the Jack - and is much safer.|

With Declarer leading the deuce, you, as West, must play the seven even though you know that the Dummy's Ten may win the trick. Your only hope is that the Declarer will consider the possibility too remote that you have Queen-Jack and do not play one of them, and will simply, as a matter of safety first, go up with the Ace, hoping that the suit will ultimately break to his advantage. You see, to play the Jack here, flaunting it in the face of Dummy's powerful holding, will give away the whole situation. |

at| which would practically tell the Declarer that you also have the Queen. He could not fail to finesse the Ten on the second round, preventing you from getting any tricks in clubs. Thus to play low on the first round is your only chance to make a club trick - by persuading the Declarer to play safe by not taking that double finesse of the Ten on the first round.|

^-|
cp||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3W|FP||AT|hen Declarer leads low and Dummy lacks any high cards, Second Hand's decision becomes a matter of common sense. In the first place, ask yourself whether you want the lead or you wish your Partner to have it. If you want your Partner to get in the lead, you naturally play low and hope that Partner can overtake the Dummy; if you want the lead yourself, you naturally play higher than any card in the Dummy.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


AT| 

But you cannot do this invariably. If you can win the trick cheaply - without the expenditure of a very high card - you should do so, generally speaking. Thus you would play the Jack from a King-Jack holding if the Dummy has no card higher than the Ten. But if you hold Ace-Queen, or only the Queen, you must be a bit circumspect.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |

Consider, for example, the following spade distribution:|

cp||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3T|FP||AT|he given situations take care of practically all low leads by the Declarer. When the Declarer leads a high card, and you are Second Hand to play before the Dummy, you have a real problem when the Dummy also holds a high card.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


AT|

You have undoubtedly heard the slogan to |cp|8|at|"cover an honor with an honor," |cp||at|which means that whenever a high card is led toward a hand which contains a higher honor, the intermediate hand (Second Hand) should play the middle honor in all cases so that the higher honor from Third Hand must be played to win the trick.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


AT|

This is in direct contradiction to that other old saw that Second Hand should always play low!|cp|8|at| Covering an honor with an honor|cp||at|, in Second Hand position, will very often prove to be the best play.  Note the following heart distribution:|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT||

st||sk||md|4hq43,hkjt,ha75,h9862|rh||ah|Diagram 9|ah|Plays by Second Hand|sv||wt|S|NT|^B@2
Here the decision is easy to reach.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


AT| If Declarer leads the Queen, you must of course cover with the King,|PC|hqhkhah2|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


AT| which assures you of 2 tricks in hearts. Against this you have the objection that if the Declarer knows much about Bridge he will not lead the Queen, for it is the height of folly to attempt such a finesse - as you already know.|

Suppose that the hearts were distributed as follows, however: |

Now Declarer leads the Queen, and what do you play?|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


AT| You certainly hesitate about covering that Queen with your King, for Dummy's Ace will surely win. But to cling to the King will do you no good, for if the Declarer also holds the Jack and Ten, he will continue to lead hearts until your King is caught eventually.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It is much better to |cp|8|at|"cover an honor with an honor,"|cp||at| forcing the Dummy's Ace in the hope that Partner may have the Jack or Ten, which will be promptly promoted.

In this example, if you, as West, lack that nine-spot with your King, you should reconsider covering an honor with an honor - especially against a good player. Any Declarer acquainted with the rudiments of the game will not lead the Queen unless he holds a lower honor with it. If Declarer does hold the Jack, however, together with the nine, he might attempt a secondary finesse, thus:|

Consequently, when you hold the King ^*Iand^*N the Ten or the nine, you should not hesitate to cover; but without one of these cards, you must weigh the issue.

NT|^B@2
As to the question of covering honors other than the Queen, you  need good judgment again. ^*IUsually^*N it is a good play to cover the jack with the Queen whenever the Dummy holds two dangerous cards, but to refrain from covering whenever the Dummy holds but one threatening card.

The only thing to hope for is that Partner holds - the nine-spot! Suppose he does:|

Carrying the principle further, sometimes Second Hand must cover even a Ten to try to establish a tenace position in Partner's hand. Study the following diagram:|

NT|^B@2 
Still another problem is when to cover honors with honors when intermediate honors are missing, such as a Jack with a King, or a Ten with a King. The same principle holds true. If Dummy holds but one high honor, to cover is generally futile. If the Dummy holds two honors, and you foresee that you are going to be placed in a tenace position under the Dummy, you must sacrifice your honor bravely.  The following diagram illustrates an extreme instance of this:|

^-{          PLAYING DEFENSIVELY BEFORE THE DECLARER          }
^-|
cp||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3T|FP||AT|he fundamental principles of playing Second Hand before the Declarer - that is, on a card led from the Dummy - are exactly the same as those governing Second Hand's play before the Dummy. There is the obvious difference that in playing before the Declarer you cannot see the cards in the next hand to play, as you can see those in the Dummy. However, strange though it may seem, this lack of visibility sometimes makes your decision easier rather than more difficult.|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


AT|

The general rule is that, unless you hold many cards of the suit led, you should ^*Ialways cover any bare honor led from the Dummy.^*N For example, with @d J 8 2 in the Dummy, and @d K 7 5 in your hand, you should not hesitate to plunk the King right on the Jack if it is led from Dummy. This cannot place your Partner in an embarrassing position because he will under no circumstances be playing before the Declarer, who holds the strong part of the suit. However, when the Dummy holds a sequence of two honors, and one of these is led, you must ^*Ipractically never cover.^*N|
PG| ***** 148 ***** |

If the Queen is led, there is no sense in refusing to cover.|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


PC|dk|at| If the finesse succeeds, a low card can catch your King later (if you do not cover at once), and Declarer will have used a minimum number of high cards to accomplish his aim. By playing the King at once you seize your one chance of making some gain, for there is a remote possibility that Partner may hold both Ten and nine. |

^*B When playing Second Hand before the Dummy - ^*N
@D Play low when to play high will certainly sacrifice a trick.  
@D Try to capture an adverse honor whenever you play to win a trick.
@d Play low when you make the Declarer guess on a double finesse from Dummy.
@d With a sequence, play high to make sure of 1 trick (if Dummy has a threatening card).
@d With a sequence, play low when to do so may make Declarer consider safety first. 
@d When Dummy has no high cards, use common sense.
@d With the King and the nine ^*Ior^*N Ten, cover Declarer's Queen lead.
@d Cover Declarer's Jack lead with the Queen whenever Dummy holds two threatening cards.
@d Do not cover Declarer's Jack lead with the Queen when Dummy holds only one threatening card. 
@d Cover Declarer's Jack lead with the Queen whenever not to do so will place you under Dummy's subsequent tenace.
@d Cover Declarer's Jack, or even Ten, to try to establish a tenace over Dummy in Partner's hand.
@d Cover Declarer's Jack or Ten with even the King when Dummy holds two honors, and you foresee that not to cover may place you in a tenace position under Dummy.
@d Do not cover when your King must win the third round anyway.|

^*BWhen playing Second Hand before the Declarer^*N - 
@D Always cover a bare honor led from Dummy (except when you hold a great many cards of the led suit).
@d Do not cover when an honor is led from a sequence in the Dummy (except when your honor heads a doubleton). |

CS||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Watson gave several examples where he felt it was right to cover when second hand had the Queen. However, in general, it is not right to cover when you have the Q and no other spot cards in 2nd seat. This is because declarer often has a guess as to who has the Q and is trying to induce you to eliminate his guess. Of course, if you hesitate when you have the Q, that tells declarer just as much as if you covered with the Queen. |

So, get in the habit of playing 2nd hand low smoothly. For every instance where it costs you a tricks, there will be three or four instances where it gains you a trick. You will note that when I and my expert friends play, we virtually always play 2nd hand low very smoothly.
