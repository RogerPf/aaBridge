^B@2^Y@3T|FP||AT|HE word "coup," from the French use of it in coup d'etat, suggests a strategic stroke, a brilliant move, whether in defense or in attack. But the word has been carelessly applied to so many widely different types of plays that it is impossible to give a definition of the word "coup" itself which will include all the plays that have been honored with the name. Practically all of these plays have come down from the days of Whist, and have merely been adapted to Bridge with its exposed Dummy hand.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

The more famous coups include those plays called the ^*bBath Coup^*n, the ^*bDeschapelles Coup^*N, the ^*bGrand Coup^*N, and the ^*bVienna Coup^*N. Two of these were named for the places in which they supposedly first occurred, namely, Bath (England) and Vienna (Austria). One, the Deschapelles, is named after the great French player who is reputed to have discovered it in the days of Whist. The Grand Coup is so called because it is a highly spectacular play in which a winner is ruffed in order to capture eventually an opposing trump honor. |
PG| ***** 2 ***** |

Various coups are treated together in this Chapter because they have happened to be called coups, though they vary widely in their structure. A quadruple Grand Coup is possible, for instance, but the combination of cards necessary for its execution, and the bidding necessary to reach a contract in which it may be utilized, are almost as unlikely as the collision of the earth and a comet.|

It might be said that the Bath Coup seldom works against good opposition. The smaller cards are very seldom so distributed that the leader can be led to believe that his Partner is starting an echo. However, it is very frequently a highly successful maneuver, in fact a must play, to this extent: Even if the Defense doesn't continue the suit and sacrifice a trick, the very fact that they must abandon the suit and thus lose a valuable time unit may result in the salvaging of Declarer's contract. |

^-|
cp||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3I|FP||AT|n sharp contrast to the Bath Coup, the Deschapelles Coup is a very brilliant and effective play available to the Defending Side on occasion. Indeed, there are two varieties of this coup. In one, a high card is deliberately sacrificed in order to knock an entry out of the Dummy and prevent the run of an established suit. In the other a high honor is deliberately sacrificed in order to create an entry in Partner's hand. The following deal illustrates the first type of coup:|

NT||lb|*CAs East which card would you play now? This quiz is not in the book!^^HK^S52HKJT6CA92DQJ4^|at|
Looking the situation over, East sees that the Declarer will probably be able to make his contract as soon as he establishes clubs. Since East holds the Ace of clubs, he can hold off for two rounds, and perhaps eliminate all the clubs from Declarer's own hand. But this will do no good so long as the Ace of hearts remains in the Dummy for an entry. Therefore, the success or failure of the contract may depend on whether the Ace of hearts can be knocked out of the Dummy.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT||at|
Obviously the lead of a low heart will not accomplish the purpose. The time element enters very strongly here, too, for East will not have a second opportunity to bring about the desired result. South's two no-trump bid must certainly mean that he has the Queen of hearts, so that for East to play a low heart will not frustrate his plans. The Jack or the Ten would meet the same fate-they would be captured by the Queen, and the Ace would be left in the Dummy. In spite of the fact that East's King is a sure winner if he holds on to it (provided Declarer leads the suit twice), East must play this card now sacrificing it deliberately - in order to make sure that Dummy's hand will be shut out of the later play.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT||at|
Of course, this play of the heart King is a refusal to return Partner's suit, but a moment's consideration will show why this return should not be weighed in the balance. South opened the bidding and rebid without an honor in clubs, with only the Queen in hearts, and, at the most, the Ace and King 'of diamonds. He must therefore hold at least the King and Queen of spades, which precludes the possibility of the spade return being at all constructive. Note what happens in the first 6 tricks, assuming that East finally decides in favor of the King of hearts' return.|

This lead of the King by East constitutes the Deschapelles Coup. The Declarer cannot refuse to win with the Ace, for, if he does, the suit will be continued.|

The other form of the Deschapelles Coup is less obvious, involving, as it does, the deliberate sacrifice of a high card in the hope of establishing an entry in Partner's hand. This deal illustrates its use. With East and West vulnerable, and North the Dealer, the bidding has gone as shown above.|MB|1cp1np2cp2np3nppp|nt||at|
The bidding is rather unusual, if not downright mad.|CP|8|fp|2|AT|*|CP||fp||at| North's opening bid is a minimum as far as high cards are concerned, but he is nevertheless compelled to take out one no-trump with two clubs. South's two no-trump bid is perfectly logical in view of the fact that his one no-trump was far above a minimum hand for that response. It is North's three no-trump bid which is incomprehensible. He should, of course, bid three clubs to sign off. However, as the cards lie South can be beaten only by expert defense.|

If West happens to hold either the Ace of diamonds or the King of clubs (a remote possibility), he is pretty sure to get in the lead anyway, but if his only possible entry should happen to be the King of hearts, the Ace of hearts has to be driven out of Dummy's hand pronto. Furthermore, East cannot afford to lead a low heart, as this will kill Partner's King (if he has it). Therefore he must lead the heart Queen, in the hope that Partner has the King, which will be set up for an entry when the heart Ace is forced out of the Dummy. |

By way of clinching this matter of the Deschapelles Coup, one more example of it is included here. This deal was actually played in the National Challenge Team-of-Four Championship (1932), in which Mr. Oswald Jacoby sat West, being the Partner of the author. Mr. Jacoby's play of the Deschapelles Coup in this deal stands on record as one of the finest defensive plays ever made.|

The opportunity for the Deschapelles Coup now presented itself. If Mr. Jacoby continued the spades, the contract would easily be made. However, he analyzed the situation correctly, and figured that Dummy's Ace of diamonds was a very necessary entry for the heart suit. Acting upon this perception,|

From this point on it was impossible for Mr. Stearns to preserve his entry, and the heart suit was successfully and completely blocked from all further play.

^-{    THE TRUMP COUP - Grand Coup    }
^-|
CS||CP||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3T|FP||AT|he Grand Coup is the most publicized - the most widely talked about - of all the trump coups. The play has gained a reputation that it does not deserve, for it is far from being a very useful play. Actually, the mechanics of it are fairly simple, for it is merely a trump-shortening play with the additional feature that the shortening is brought about by the deliberate ruffing of 1 or 2^*I winners^*N.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


AT|

To make the Grand Coup clear, it is first necessary to explain the simple coup. The opportunity to make a simple coup occurs when the Declarer holds a finessing position in the trump suit over the player on his right, but cannot finesse because of the lack of trump cards in the Dummy. His play must therefore be to reduce the number of his own trumps to the same number as held by his right hand Opponent, meanwhile arranging the lead so that, at the proper time, the Dummy's hand will be in the lead to come through the Opponent's trumps. The way of shortening Declarer's own trumps is to ruff some of Dummy's cards, as in the following situation.|

On the lead of the Ten of spades, in other words, both Opponents imperturbably follow suit, but the trick must still be won in the Declarer's own hand.

*|CP||FP||AT| The trump coup, simple or Grand, is further dubbed single, double, triple, etc., according to the number of cards ruffed for the purpose of shortening Declarer's own trump holding. If Declarer has one more trump than his right-hand Opponent, and shortens his holding by one ruff, the play is a single coup; if he shortens himself twice, it is a double coup. The triple coup, simple or Grand, is extremely rare. As was stated earlier, a Quadruple Grand Coup can be set up artificially, but such a hand will probably never be dealt in actual play. - ^*ISam Fry, Jr.|

At this point, South learns that East still holds the King of spades, guarded. The Dummy holds no more trumps, and so the only way in which the King of trumps can be captured is through a coup.

If East is permitted to discard when another heart is led, he will undoubtedly throw off a card from his shortest suit.

East is forced to ruff ahead of South, and South holds a tenace in trumps which enables him to over-ruff and draw the last trump. Thus East's guarded King is roped in, in spite of the fact that Declarer had no small trumps in Dummy which would let him take a finesse.|

If at the eighth trick he had led a small diamond instead of the Ace, winning with Dummy's King, and then led his last heart, West would have thrown off a diamond and would have ruffed the third round of this suit, had Declarer led it again at the tenth trick. |

For this reason, a coup situation resembles, in a vague sort of way, a cross-ruff situation, in that the side suits must be led out first so as not to give the Opponents any chance to throw off losers. At the same time, the side suits cannot be eliminated too quickly, for they may be needed for communication purposes - their high cards serve as needed entries. |

NT|^B@2
All in all, it is impossible to execute a coup successfully without looking ahead and planning exactly what is going to happen at each trick. If you do not see ahead of you the precise position you wish to bring about at the twelfth trick, you may just as well not bother with the coup at all. |

CS||cp||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3I|FP||AT|t is a comparatively simple matter to change the preceding double simple coup into a Grand Coup.

This leaves the Declarer with the same number of entries to the Dummy, and he should play the hand in exactly the same fashion as the preceding one, the only difference being that when he shortens himself by trumping hearts, he is trumping ^*Iwinning^*N cards instead of ^*Ilosing^*N (small) cards. In spite of the fact that the principle of play in both hands is the same, the former is correctly called the double simple coup, and this play is given the name of Double Grand Coup.|sk||

CS||cp||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3T|FP||AT|he following deal is very much like the two preceding; in fact, only three cards are differently placed. The Queen of diamonds has been transferred to the South hand, and North and West have exchanged two hearts. What does this change of the diamond Queen do? It removes one of the Declarer's essential entries from the Dummy and consequently prevents him from shortening himself in trumps and at the same time ending up in the Dummy for the coup lead. He cannot possibly do all these things ^*Iunless the Opponents assist him^*N. First look at the deal, and then consider the possibilities:|

NT|^B@2
The crucial point for the Defending Side comes right here. West should know that South is hoping to execute a coup, and he should therefore try to prevent him from shortening himself in trumps. The temptation to lead a heart is very great, as it seems to be a very safe lead. But the heart is one lead which will let the Declarer accomplish his purpose, since it will give him a ruff, thereby shortening him in trumps, ^*Iwithout wasting one of the precious re-entries^*N. Let us see how it works.|
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


NT|^B@2
After the heart ruff (if West leads a heart) the Declarer will take three rounds of diamonds, winding up in the Dummy, and then trump the last heart in his own hand. This will reduce him to two trumps, and a low club led to the King serves his final re-entry to the Dummy. If West leads some card other than a heart, however, the Declarer will not be able to shorten himself and retain his last entry at the same time.|

Thus you see, that by making a few minor changes, the simple coup, the Grand Coup and a coup in which the Declarer must rely on an Opponent to help him, can all be illustrated with much the same deal. The importance of timing is just as great to the Defending Side as to the Declarer. |

NT|^B@2
The number of entries which are needed into the Dummy is always one more than the number of times one must shorten himself. In this hand, then, three entries into the Dummy must be found.^*N|

NT|^B@2
Unfortunately, the Dummy appears to have only two entries, namely, a club and a diamond. This permits South to get through the shortening process all right, but he will not wind up with the lead in the proper hand. The only chance therefore depends on finding an extra entry, and the Jack of diamonds pops up as an immediate possibility.|
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If West happens to have the Queen, the Jack can be finessed, and the coup is in the bag. Of course, if East has the Queen of diamonds, taking this finesse will mean that South is set 2 tricks instead of 1, but this is negligible in comparison with the chance of making game.

The lead is in the Dummy (North) - let us assume that to have the lead there at this point was prearranged by the Declarer, Dummy of course holding no trumps. The hand has actually been "couped," for in this situation South must make a trick with his Ten (the Ace and Jack already having been played). If the lead is in the South hand at this point, no tricks at all can be obtained in this suit (trumps). |
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The trump coup is applicable to any combination of cards resembling a tenace, whenever a finesse is impossible. It depends, of course, on learning that the right-hand Opponent holds the missing honors ^*Iunder^*N your own tenace, and on being able to lead from the Dummy at a time when he must play before you - or ruff before you, to be more exact. Two things must always be remembered, namely, that the Opponents must be prevented from discarding if possible, and that the number of entries to the Dummy must be one more than the number of times it is necessary for the Declarer to shorten himself in trumps. |
