qx|CHIB02,THE LESS COMMON FINESSING SITUATIONS |
NT||HT|e|at|^B@2^Y@3I|FP||AT|n early chapters, the usual finessing situations were explained. The rarer situations were postponed until a later place, and now is the time to take them up. You realize, of course, that a finesse can become established through an Opponent's lead, as in the following simple situation:|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


NT||
st||pn|You,,,|ha|Y|md|2sK43,,sAt9,sJ65|rh||AH|A1|NT|^B@2 
If you, as the Declarer (South), should be forced to lead this suit, you can obtain only 2 tricks at the most. However, if the suit is led by either East or West, a finessing position will be established for you which will enable you to make 3 tricks. |
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|^B@2
For instance, if West leads the deuce,|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


md|0,s2.0,0|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


PC|S2|cp||AT|^*B you play Dummy's nine and East will have to play the Jack.^*N|PC|s9sj|

PG| ***** 6 ***** |


PC|SK|md|0,sq87,0,0|AT|^*B and leave the Dummy in perfect tenace position over West's Queen-eight.^*N|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


NT||
st||ha|Y|md|hA32,,hjt9,|rh||AH|A2|at|^B@2
Again, similarly, if West leads this suit, you (South), are bound to get 2 tricks no matter how the other honors are distributed. It is true that you can finesse twice in this suit yourself, |
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


md|hA32,hkq,hjt9,|at|^*B  but if West should happen to hold both the Queen and the King, you could not help losing 2 tricks.^*N|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


NT||
ST||HA|Y|MD|2d954,,dAJ7,|rh||AH|A3|NT|^B@2
Here is a slightly more complex situation.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


AT|^*B If you (South) have to lead this suit yourself, you can make only 1 trick in it. ^*N|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


at|But if West should ever lead it, you can make 2 tricks if you guess right. Your best chance is not to finesse the Jack, in hope that West holds both the King and the Queen, but to allow the trick to come around to your nine-spot. You should play the seven from Dummy,|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


MD|0,d3,0,0|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


NT|^B@2
which forces East to win with the King (if he has it).|PC|d3d7|md|0,0,0,dk|PC|dk|PC|d4|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


at|^*B This leaves your Ace-Jack in a very formidable position over West's Queen-Ten.^*N|md|0,dqt6,0,d82|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT||
ST||HA|Y|MD|c754,cKt63,cAJ9,cQ82|rh||AH|A4|NT|^B@2
Changing the preceding combinations of cards around a little, you find that it is possible for you to make 2 tricks out of Ace-Jack-nine combinations even if the lead does not come from an Opponent, for instance, here:|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


pc|c4c3c9|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


at|^*B With the cards thus placed, you can lead low from your own hand and finesse Dummy's nine.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


pc|cq|at| This again establishes a second-round tenace.^*N|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||
ST||HA|Y|MD|s983,sQt6,sAJ4,sK752|rh||AH|A5|NT|^B@2
Or again, here you can lead the nine and pass it, since you also hold the eight.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


pc|s9|AT|^*B However, West can circumvent you by covering the nine with the Ten. ^*N|PC|ST|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


at| This forces Dummy's Jack, and the trick is won by East's King.^*N|PC|SJSK|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


cp||AT| On the second round, if you lead the eight,|wt|s|cp||
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


pc|s8sqsas2|at|^*B West should cover with his Queen. This establishes the seven-spot in East's hand as a third-round winner. ^*N|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


cp||NT||
ST||HA|Y|MD|s987,sQt6,sAJ4,sK532|rh||AH|A6|at|^B@2
Give South the nine-eight-seven instead of just nine-eight-three, as here however, and all the covering in the world by West will not harm South's play.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The next combinations are also fairly frequent:|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||
ST||HA|Y|MD|h432,,hKt98,|rh||AH|A7|AT|^B@2
Here, if your contract is such that you must win 2 tricks in this particular suit, your proper play is to lead low and finesse Dummy's eight-spot. This will probably drive out the Jack or the Queen, and on the second round you must hope that the finesse of the nine-spot will drive out the Ace. In other words, you hope that West holds either the Queen or the Jack.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||
ST||HA|Y|MD|d432,,dqt98,|rh||AH|A8|AT|^B@2
Here, you must simply hope to find the Jack in the West hand. By leading low from your own hand, and finessing the eight and subsequently the nine, you may succeed in losing only 2 tricks to the Ace-King. This, of course, leaves 2 tricks in the suit for you.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT|^B@2
These combinations will occur again and again, and you will not always be able to secure the maximum number of tricks by the plays just described. But that does not detract from the efficacy of the plays in the long run.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Unfortunately, cards very often seem to take a perverse delight in being divided unfavorably, so that the most expert manipulation will not develop the desired tricks. However, as already said, these methods offer the best chance, and will gain tricks more often than any other method. This is not a matter of opinion; it is sound Bridge mathematics.|

qx|CHIB03,THE OBLIGATORY FINESSE|
NT||HT|e|va|6|cs|1|cp|4|fp||at|^-{    THE OBLIGATORY FINESSE    }
^-|cp||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3O|FP||AT|ne particular type of finesse is called the Obligatory Finesse, for reasons which will appear. In some ways this play does not resemble a finesse at all, but it has become known as one because it is an attempt to take tricks with cards not in sequence. Recall for a moment the earlier discussion about combinations which lack the Ace and the Jack of a suit. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


AT|

You will remember that if you hold K x x in one hand and Q 10 x in the other hand, the proper play is to lead a low card up to the King. If the King holds the trick, you readily place the Ace in the hand on the left of the Queen-Ten and finesse the Ten on the return round. |
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


AT|

The Obligatory Finesse is really the same play, with the exception that the Ten is missing, and consequently the play is a finesse around five or six cards instead of but one! If you simply remember this characteristic you will have no trouble in recognizing the situation when it comes up.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |

It is, by now, evident that the success of your contract depends on your early development of diamonds, but it is also as sure as sundown that if you lose 2 diamond tricks you cannot make three-odd (your contract). Since the Ace, Jack, Ten, and nine of diamonds are all missing, and the Opponents hold a total of five diamonds between them, it looks at first glance as though you are up against it and no mistake. However, there is one chance, and you must avail yourself of it without any fiddling around.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |

At the third trick you should lead a low diamond.|

The Ace is pretty well marked in the West hand, but the location of the Jack is still a dark secret. Yet you can be sure of one thing: if East has the Jack, West's Ace is alone! If this is true, you must play low, because you will then establish the next 3 diamond tricks for yourself.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |

As a matter of fact, West's Ace does come out on your six-spot, and your troubles are ended.|

PG| ***** 51 ***** |


mc|9|sc|Y|NT|^B@2
Note that the play just described can lose nothing. If West holds the Jack together with his Ace, he is sure of obtaining 2 tricks in the suit no matter what you do. Your only chance is to hope that his original holding consisted of Ace-small. Note also that this is your only chance of making the contract. Even if by some unforeseen chance you could win 3 heart tricks, this would give you only 8 tricks in all. And you really stood no chance of making 3 tricks in hearts.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This Obligatory Finesse - obligatory because it is the only way you can play the suit to hold the Opponents to 1 trick in it (provided the Jack is placed right for you) - would have been easier to recognize in this deal if you had held the Ten of diamonds in your own hand. Actually, this card was of no importance, since everything depended, in this particular deal, on the location of the Jack. Incidentally, if the position of the King and Queen were reversed, the play would be exactly the same.|

The same sort of play can be used with an Ace-Queen combination, although the choice is a little more difficult. Look at the first of next two examples.|

AT| Obviously, you stand very little chance of accomplishing much with either of these holdings by leading the Queen to the Ace, for you do not hold the Jack.|

In this second combination, you have to choose between a simple finesse and an Obligatory Finesse. If you think the King lies with East, you must come up with the Queen, but if you think the King lies with West, you have a chance of catching it by playing low. In other words, you then hope that West's original holding consisted of King-small.|

QX|CHIB04,FINESSING TO ELIMINATE A GUESS|

^-|
cp||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3W|FP||AT|e now come to a type of finesse which has not been discussed at all as yet. It has no real name, but is used simply to eliminate a guess.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT||
ST||HA|Y|MD|hQt98,,hA742,|rh||AH|C1|NT|^B@2
Suppose that your hand and Dummy's contain the above cards. You need 3 tricks in this suit. According to the preceding discussion, your best chance would seem to be to lead out Dummy's Ace and follow with a low card to the Queen-Ten. If East should also play low on the second round, however, you are forced to guess whether to finesse the Ten or the Queen. You may guess right, and then, on the other hand, you may not.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT|^B@2
There is a method of play which eliminates this guesswork and at the same time offers just as much chance of success. This consists of leading the Queen out of your own hand first. Obviously, if West holds the King your troubles are over without more ado, as, no matter whether he covers or not, one of the honors has been located. If West covers, you simply win with the Ace and eventually give up a trick to the Jack. |
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If West does not cover, this leaves the Opponents with only three cards of the suit, so that you are certain that you will lose but 1 trick in it. Now suppose that East holds the King and wins the trick. Then the only card in which you are interested is the Jack, and you simply finesse for this card the next time the lead is in your own hand.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In other words, this mode of play is bound to win 3 tricks if West holds either one or both of the missing honors. It can lose if East holds both the King and the Jack, but it offers just as much chance of success as leading the Ace first, which must lose if West holds both honors. Its advantage lies entirely in the fact that the guess is eliminated. Of course, the play must not be used if the bidding seems to indicate that East holds both of the missing honors.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Strangely enough, the combination of cards just discussed can occasionally win 4 tricks, as in the next two distributions.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT||
ST||HA|Y|MD|dQt98,dk,dA742,dJ653|rh||AH|C2|NT|^B@2
Here, if you lead out Dummy's Ace, West's King will fall, and all that you have to do is finesse against East's Jack twice. |
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT||
ST||HA|Y|MD|cQt98,cK653,cA742,cj|rh||AH|C3|NT|^B@2
In this combination, you can lead out your own Queen, and, if West covers with the King, the Ace will also capture East's lone Jack. Of course, if West does not cover, the Queen simply picks up East's Jack and you continue finessing through West's King until it falls. |
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It is true that in each case you might decide on the losing play, but this is a question of human fallibility, for no Bridge player is clairvoyant. These particular combinations are highly improbable, but it is just as well for the reader to realize their possibility. Suppose that the above combination is not quite so solid, as the next example.|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT||
ST||HA|Y|MD|Qt65,,A932,|rh||AH|C4|NT|^B@2
Now the Queen cannot be led safely because of the missing eight spot. The best play is to lead low from Dummy at the first opportunity, and, if East also plays low, guess whether to play the Ten or the Queen. Even if you guess wrong, the fact that the Ace remains in Dummy gives you a second-round finesse.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT||
ST||HA|Y|MD|sQJ43,,sA65,|rh||AH|C5|NT|^B@2
This example is slightly different. With this combination the best way of playing for 3 tricks is to lead low from the Ace. 1f the King is in the East hand, your troubles are over, and if it is in the West hand you can still hope for a 3-3 break. Leading the Queen for a first-round finesse through West can only win 3 tricks on the 3-3 break.|

PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT||
ST||HA|Y|MD|sAJ876,,sQ93,|rh||ah|Example X|NT|^B@2
There are five cards missing in the suit, including the King and the Ten. Therefore more than a simple finesse is called for. Your best play is to lead low from Dummy and finesse your Jack. If the Jack holds, you are confronted with two possibilities.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The Opponents' cards may have been divided originally in one of three ways, as follows. In all three instances, you first lead a low card from Dummy (North) and finesse your Jack, which holds the trick, West playing low. Of course, if West drops the Ten, you have a simple finesse left - by leading twice more through East's King.|

PG| ***** 92 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It follows from the preceding discussion that the play of the Queen on the second round is generally the best. The play loses if the first division (COMBINATION 1) exists, and gains if the second or third divisions (COMBINATION 2 and 3) exist. |
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The play is marked when the Ten drops on the first round. With such combinations as these, as with all others, the play offering the best chance of success is usually the one to choose. Incidentally, reversal of the Queen and Jack does not affect the manner of playing the suit for the best results.|
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


NT||
ST||HA|Y|MD|hj43,hQt2,hAK98,h765|rh||AH|D1|NT|^B@2
This is a similar situation. Here the lead of the Jack from your own hand is bound to win 4 tricks in the suit if West holds both the Queen and the Ten. This is a play made without much hope of success, but is used when 4 tricks must be squeezed out of this particular suit. It also wins when the Ten is alone or doubleton in the East hand. If only 3 tricks are needed in the suit, the play for the drop of the Queen on the first or second round is equally good. |
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


NT||
ST||HA|Y|MD|dj76,,dAK943,|rh||AH|D2|NT|^B@2
The same principle applies to this situation. Your proper play is to lead out the King and, if neither the Queen nor the Ten falls, you have a choice of plays. You can play the Ace and hope that the Queen will drop, or you can lead the Jack from your own hand and hope that East's original holding was Ten-small, as in this way you can drop two honors together.|

^-|
CS||cp||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3Y|FP||AT|ou are now ready to consider the very valuable type of finesse called the Backward Finesse. Unlike other finesses, this play is not made to gain a trick, but is made to lose a trick immediately for the purpose of keeping one of the Opponents out of the lead.|
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


NT||
ST||HA|Y|MD|cA432,,cKJt9,|rh||AH|E1|NT|^B@2
We earlier discussed a combination of cards like the above. The finesse can be taken either one of two ways with equal likelihood of success. The way you choose must depend on which hand it is desirable to keep out of the lead-in the event that the finesse loses. Thus the precise purpose of the Backward Finesse comes to the front. |
PG| ***** 98 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It is called backward because it is taken in an unnatural way rather than in the way that most players would consider natural. Strangely enough, this unnatural or "backward" way sometimes results in gaining a trick which would have been lost by the natural approach. The following hand is a good illustration.|

You also see that you do not need all 5 of the diamond tricks which are possible. If you can take only 4 diamond tricks, you will have the 9 tricks necessary for your contract. Therefore, you are perfectly willing to give up a trick immediately if such a course seems advisable. Obviously, it is not only advisable but necessary, because you realize the danger of allowing West to gain the lead on account of his established hearts.|

You therefore see that the natural method of finessing diamonds (leading ^*I[low]^*N over to Dummy's Ace and finessing the Jack on the way back) would lose your contract if the finesse loses. You must, then, play the Jack from your own hand with the intention of passing it if West plays low. You are perfectly willing to allow East to win the trick, since he presumably is exhausted of hearts.|

What actually happens is rather remarkable. If West plays low you can take 5 diamond tricks instead of 4; if West covers, (let us go back to the beginning of the trick),|

Let us now consider the possible adverse diamond distribution to see why the Backward Finesse was so necessary.|

To begin with, as in this example, West might have Q 10 x, when no play will succeed. ^*I[Let us look at a deal more friendly.]^*N|

Of course, as in this example, West could hold the Queen-Ten alone, and your play would then surely succeed, as the King would drop the Ten on the second round (if West covers the Jack). At this point, you may say, "But we might have finessed the nine," and the answer is that you would not have done so because you were still trying to keep West out of the lead and you were still willing to give up the trick to East's Ten if he held it.|

Thirdly, East might have Q x, Q x x, or 10 x x. Fine! You lose but 1 trick in the suit - and that to East. The possible 4-1 distribution offers about an even break on chances. The Backward Finesse gains with some and loses with others. It is the tremendous advantage secured when the adverse distribution is 3-2 that makes the Backward Finesse so often a winning play - and the only winning play available.|

Generally, the attempt with the more complex finesses is to give up tricks to as high outstanding cards as possible, so that later handling of the suit becomes less a matter of pure guesswork.|

The Obligatory Finesse requires the play of a low card with the hope of finding the missing honors divided in the only way that will hold the Opponents to the fewest tricks (usually 1 trick, with the best division). Leading the Queen to the Ace, even without the Jack, if the Ten-nine-eight are also held, will eliminate the guess about the location of the missing King and Jack, for it should locate one of them immediately.|
PG| ***** 119 ***** |

The Backward Finesse is similar, in that it consists of leading a card which can be finessed instead of leading up to it, with the intention of giving up a trick to keep the dangerous Opponent out of the lead if the finesse should fail. |
