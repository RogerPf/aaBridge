qx|15B01,No-Trump Plays at Suit Contracts|
nt||HT|e|at|
^B@2At no-trump, the play of a hand consists almost entirely of making tricks with high cards and with the low cards which may be established in long suits - that is to say, high-card tricks and long-suit tricks. At a suit contract, on the other hand, the play consists chiefly of making high-card tricks and short-suit tricks (the latter are also called ruffing-tricks). The long-suit trick is occasionally present in suit play, but it is usually of minor importance.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

With one type of hand, played at a suit, the long-suit trick does become of just about as much important as the short-suit trick. This type of hand, because of the nature of the play, is really much more like a no-trump hand than a trump hand; in fact, it would be a no-trump hand if it were not for the fact that one of the four suits is the declared trump. This kind of hand is characterized, generally, by some fairly long side suit in the hand with the fewest entries.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |

This hybrid - the "no-trump-suit" hand - calls for a trump postponement play. The following deal is a good example:|

NT|^B@2
The adverse trumps offer no obstacle, for they can probably be drawn in three leads. Further, unless one Opponent has four spades to the Jack, there is no adverse commanding trump. However, Dummy's singleton diamond focuses your attention on the fact that ruffing power is available there - Dummy's three trumps look like just the answer to the three losing diamonds in your own hand.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


NT|
^B@2Now look just a bit further. Suppose you lead the diamond Ace, exhausting the Dummy of the suit, and follow with a small diamond which you ruff with Dummy's spade five. The only way you can reenter your hand is to lead Dummy's last heart (three rounds of hearts have already been played, you know) and ruff it in your own hand. |

What is likely to be the best way to make your contract? Of course, you can first draw trumps and then establish the club suit, but East will certainly not be so accommodating as to play his Ace on the first round of clubs - and if he wins the second round, you will be shut out of the Dummy with a vengeance, for your only possible entry, the spade Queen, has vanished.|

The only way to manage this hand is to play it exactly as though the contract were no-trump. You must, to avoid blocking yourself, establish the club suit before touching spades. Thus you retain the spade Queen in the Dummy as a re-entry for the set-up clubs.|

Note that ruffing even one diamond in the Dummy would have proved disastrous. When the time came to draw trumps, you could then have taken only two rounds - if you wished to use the Queen as a re-entry for the clubs. This would mean that East would trump the fourth round of clubs, forcing you to wind up with one losing diamond, shattering all hopes of making your contract.|

Your contract is four hearts, of which you have only seven against the Opponents' six, and although scarcity of trumps may become one of your minor troubles, this need not worry you unduly since you are lucky enough to have controlling cards in all the side suits. However, West, like a worthy Opponent, makes things difficult by choosing for his opening lead the club King, thereby removing your only control card in clubs (your Ace).|

NT|^B@2
You know from West's King lead that he has some club tricks, even if you are not sure he has as many as 4. Note that by drawing trumps, which requires four trump leads, you exhaust both your own hand and Dummy of hearts, so that you have no ruffing power available to stop that run of clubs by West.

The temptation to tackle an attractive side suit may be very strong, and yet it is entirely possible that the invitation to establish the side suit can be declined until trumps have been drawn. In fact in the majority of instances, the establishment of the side suit can wait until the drawing of all the adverse trumps has destroyed all threats of possible ruffs by the Opponents.|

Since your victory is certain, you may just as well look around for an extra trick or so. Those diamonds look intriguing, for you have seven against the Opponents' six. Of your seven, Dummy has five topped by Ace-King, so your own two small ones are well taken care of. Now what about those three small diamonds in the Dummy? Is there not some way of benefiting from your superior diamond length?|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


NT|
^B@2There is. If the adverse diamonds are divided 3-3, or even 4-2, you can establish 1 or 2 long-suit tricks by ruffing Dummy's small diamonds in your own hand. You therefore plan to cash in Dummy's Ace and King of diamonds, and ruff the third round in your own hand. You thus take advantage of the fact that one of your suits happens to be the trump suit, but the principle involved here is basically a principle of no-trump play.|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Should you develop diamonds immediately? No, for you hold all the high trumps, and the Dummy actually has four trumps, which means that the matter of entries is no source of worry.

Some readers are doubtless agog with an earlier statement made to the effect that the Declarer's own hand practically never contains any ruffing power. At first thought, this example may seem to contradict this statement. When you ruffed the third round of diamonds in your hand you were not trying to make a ruffing-trick. You were trying to establish a long-suit trick in the Dummy. In other words, this was not a senseless waste of a trump which would have been a good trick in any event, but instead was the sacrifice of a good trump for the purpose of establishing some extra tricks.|

The diamond distribution was very favorable for your purposes in this last deal. If the adverse diamonds had broken 4-2, you would have been obliged to trump two rounds of diamonds in your own hand. Instead of establishing 2 winners for discarding purposes, you would have been able to throw off only one heart, ultimately losing the other heart to the Opponents. Also, if the diamonds had been divided 5-1, you would have set up no diamond winners at all.|

^B@2There would then have been nothing you could do about it, but you would have lost nothing by trying. Your 2 losing heart tricks, which you saw at once when you first examined the hand, would then have been lost in spite of everything. However, at no time was your contract in any danger whatsoever.|

Your first examination of your prospects is discouraging. Your one hope lies in how the adverse hearts may break. If the adverse hearts are divided 3-3, there is a chance of setting up a couple of long-suit tricks by ruffing the third round, but you are annoyed by the barrenness of the Dummy in the matter of entries.|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


NT|
^B@2The only obvious entry is the Jack of spades, which will be killed by any premature drawing of three rounds of trumps. You might lay down the Ace and King of trumps, and then lead three rounds of hearts, but this will not obviate your difficulty if the hearts are unfortunately distributed. There is the further possibility of a ruffing-trick in clubs (third round).|

An immediate ruff of spades can do you no good. The only suits offering any number of tricks are hearts and diamonds. You have only 1 other trick: the club Ace. You may discard some of your losing clubs on the long diamonds in the Dummy, but the number is limited. There are only two more diamonds in the Dummy than in your own hand, which means only two discards will be available.|

If you ruff the spade trick (which you will lose if you do not ruff), you must ultimately lose a club trick instead. What if, instead of ruffing here, you throw off a club? Study the situation carefully. If you trump, you will have only three trumps left in your hand and three in Dummy's hand. Before you can run off your diamonds, you will have to draw trumps. If the adverse trumps break 3-3, you will be all right, but if they should break 4-2, you will find yourself exhausted of trumps while the Opponents have one left. |

CS||CP||FP||AT|^B@2^Y@3M|FP||AT|ost Declarers have a tendency to regard their own hand as the supreme one, and look upon the Dummy as merely supplementary or secondary. When they check over their losing tricks, they do so, almost invariably, from the viewpoint of their own hand. This is generally correct, but there are still many occasions when the Declarer's own hand must be looked upon as the secondary holding of the partnership. After all, it makes no difference which hand wins the bulk of the tricks so long as they are won by the partnership. The following deal is a good illustration of this:|

Looking at the possibilities entirely from the standpoint of your own hand, things look rather dark. You can give up a club trick immediately, and thus make available 2 ruffing-tricks in the Dummy. You can also hope that East has the heart King, so that you can finesse against it for 2 heart tricks. But if West should have the heart King, this mode of play will mean the loss of your contract by 1 trick.|
PG| ***** 200 ***** |


NT|^B@2
There is another possibility. Perhaps you can lead some of Dummy's diamonds in order to trump in your own hand, and eventually establish a long-suit trick for discarding purposes. But if you do this, you will sacrifice your ruffing-tricks in clubs. What should you do? You can answer this question if you will pretend, for the moment, that your own hand is the Dummy, and the Dummy is Declarer.|

Looking at the South hand as though it were the Dummy, you see that you can lead a low spade to North's Ten, and then lead out the diamond Queen, on which you discard from the South hand a small club!

The likelihood of gaining a long-suit trick is sufficient justification for postponing the trump lead, provided you lose nothing by so doing. But you should postpone drawing trumps only when you have a clearly defined reason for doing so, and only when that reason is something to your advantage.|
PG| ***** 244 ***** |


AT|

The talk about "no-trump play" as applied to suit contracts need not disturb you. As long as you understand each hand, and perceive the principle demonstrated, whether the principle rightfully belongs in the category of no-trump or  suit play is not at all an important question. The hands are grouped together here because they are in many ways similar in kind, and because it is felt that the reader is sufficiently advanced to understand them.|
PG| ***** 245 ***** |


AT|

The warning about not always looking upon the Dummy as the secondary hand, however, should be heeded. Again the terms used need not be remembered. You merely view your prospects from the standpoint of the combined hands: If it ever seems advisable to make Dummy the Declarer, you must do so.
