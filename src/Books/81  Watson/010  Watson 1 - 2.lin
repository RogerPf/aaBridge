^B@2In our discussion of honors thus far, we have assumed that the lead must be made by South (you) or an Opponent. We have not mentioned that the North or Dummy hand may also lead - in fact, must lead when it is that hand's turn to lead. In short, the Declarer playing a hand at Contract Bridge must pay particular attention to this matter of which hand has the lead - himself or Dummy - and so plan his play that the lead will always be in the hand where it is to his best advantage to have it at any particular moment. |

This appears even with such a simple thing as the holding of a King with only small cards below it in the same suit. Though this holding is valued at 1/2 trick in most bidding systems, because it stands a fifty-fifty chance of winning a trick in the play, it can actually win a trick only if the King is played in a certain way, and that way depends on how the suit is led.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |

You can see at once that with several honors in a row, or in sequence, as we say - such as K Q J of a suit in one hand, and a few small cards of the same suit in the Dummy - it makes no difference which hand leads the suit or which of the honors is played first. Any one of the three high cards, since all are held by the same side, will drive out the Ace, leaving the other two in command of the suit. That is, a holding of K Q J in the same suit will certainly take 2 tricks (barring the possibility of being ruffed). The same is true if the three honors are divided between the two partnership hands, as in the following heart distribution:|

But, you ask, what if the left-hand Opponent holds the Ace? Then you can do nothing, for he will win the King no matter whether you lead it directly or play it by leading up to it from the other hand.

The fact that there are two Opponents, and that only one of them can hold the Ace, gives the guarded King its fifty-fifty chance of winning - hence the 1/2 trick valuation, which means 1 trick half the time and 0 trick the other half. |CP|8|AT|In playing the hand as in anything else you do, never forget the truism that a fifty-fifty chance is better than no chance at all!|CP||AT| To lead the King in the preceding heart holding is futile; to lead up to the King may win.|

The holding of the King and Queen of clubs, together with a small club in the same hand, is regarded as worth about 1 1/2 tricks for bidding purposes - to the prospective Declarer or Dummy. That is, if a Declarer plays this combination of cards, he will make either 1 club trick or 2 club tricks, depending on how he plays the clubs, and on his luck. The way to be sure of making only 1 trick is to lead the King from the North hand, letting the trick be won by the Ace, and the Queen is then good for the next round.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Can the Opponents be prevented from winning all the club tricks but one? If you are going to try to stop them, you must lead from your weak hand toward the strong hand - that is, lead the four-spot up to the King-Queen holding. If West plays low, you then play the King or the Queen (they are equal in value) from the North hand, and if East does not have the Ace, you win the trick. You can repeat this process by returning to the South hand (by leading a card of some other suit, which we will assume you hold, that can be won in the South hand, giving that hand the lead again) and leading the six-spot.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If West still plays low, you play your other high card, and win the second round - 2 club tricks. That is, if West holds the Ace of clubs, this method of playing your club holding will always win 2 tricks, for if West plays the Ace on the first or second round, you merely play your deuce from the Dummy (North). If East holds the Ace, of course, you will make only 1 trick - but remember the truism about some chance being better than none!|

The principle of leading from the weak hand toward the stronger, to avoid unnecessarily throwing a high card under an adverse Ace or other winner, applies with equal effect if one hand holds @C K Q J 3 and the other hand three small cards of the same suit. The hand with the three small, by leading three times toward the stronger hand, can win 3 tricks in this suit if the left-hand Opponent holds the Ace - even if that Ace has three small cards with it! Indeed, it is a good general rule, whenever you play an honor combination that is not in continuous sequence, to lead from the weak hand toward the stronger.|

^b@2Up to this point we have discussed only the play of honors that are in sequence. Yet, in actual play, most of the honor combinations you hold will be broken up so that sometimes the honors are one position apart (with one intervening card missing), and sometimes more widely separated (with more than one intervening card missing).|

CP|8|AT|^-

A broken sequence of honors - that is, a combination of honors not in continuous sequence
is known as a tenace. * 

^-|cp|8|fp|1|at|* |fp||cp||at| The word "tenace" has no relation to either "Ten" or "Ace;" but is French in origin and is closely related to the word "tenacious," carrying the connotation of holding. As a matter of fact - though it is of small importance - the tenace was originally, in Whist, a holding, by the fourth hand to play, of a combination of high cards, such as the major or minor tenace, which gave him the winning position over an adversary with the missing honors. Later the word was applied to such a broken honor combination held by any player. The word is pronounced with the accent on the first syllable, and the (a) long as in Ace.  |AT|^*i - Sam Fry, Jr.^*N|

^b@2In the days of Whist, the best and third best cards of the suit formed the "major tenace," and the second and fourth best cards the "minor tenace." For all practical purposes in Contract Bridge, however, any combination of two or more high cards not in sequence may be regarded as a tenace. Any tenace holding, as already stated, should be played up to or toward rather than away from. The so-called major tenace, or Ace Queen holding, clearly shows the advantage of this, as follows:

All bidding valuations give the Ace-Queen the value Of 1 1/2 tricks. Yet if you lead the Ace and follow it with the Queen, you have practically no chance of making 2 tricks - your only chance, indeed, depends on the King being a singleton in an Opponent's hand. The best chance, then, is to lead the deuce toward the Ace-Queen, so that, if West plays the King, you can win with the Ace from Dummy, or if West plays low, you can play the Queen from Dummy, hoping that East does not have the King. Whenever West holds the King, then, with the diamond holding shown, the Ace-Queen is worth 2 tricks, but it is worth only 1 trick if East has the King.|

^B@2You may ask why, if West holds the King, he does not play it? |
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


AT|He holds it up for the simple reason that  it would do him no good to play it, since he cannot thereby affect the winning power of Dummy's holding of Ace-Queen. Indeed, West has a very slight chance of gaining something by holding up his King, for if you cannot afford to take the fifty-fifty chance that East does not hold the King, you will be obliged to play the Ace from Dummy. This is a rare situation, however; it is mentioned here only to emphasize further the definite advantage of leading from your weak holding toward your stronger holding in playing tenaces. This manner of playing tenaces has a name familiar to every card player. It is called taking a finesse.|cp|8|at|*  

* |CP||AT|Writers on Bridge have used the word "finesse" very carelessly. So that there may be no misunderstanding, the reader should note the correct usage observed in this book, as follows: To finesse a card is to play that card; thus, in the example just given the Queen is finessed. The outstanding King is the card finessed against, or the card the player hopes to capture by his finessing maneuver. Thus, you finesse against a missing honor but you finesse the card you yourself play, the card finessed being so played that it has a chance of winning against the missing higher card.   |AT|^*i - Sam Fry, Jr.^*N|
pg| ***** 43 ***** |


at|

Though a finesse is an extremely elementary play, it is also a very important play. The greatest of experts use finesses. Some unthinking players regard a finesse as a gamble, and get the idea that they may lose something by taking a finesse. Unless there is some better play available, a finesse stands to win and actually loses nothing - for it may win a trick which would be lost if the honors were led in rotation or led directly into the Opponents' hands. |
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


AT|

Every finesse is so planned that only one of the two Opponents is given an opportunity to win the trick with his higher card (if he has it), as against a sure-to-lose method of play whereby either Opponent is given the chance to play that higher card and win the trick. Thus, in the example just given, by finessing the Queen you give only one Opponent, East, the chance to play the King if he has it. But if you lead the Queen, before or after the Ace, you give either Opponent a chance to play the King on it and win it. A finesse is therefore a strategic play which is sure to win a trick if the higher missing honor is in a favorable position.|

^B@2The finesses thus far explained have been characterized by the play of a high card third hand - that is, next to the last card played to the trick. A finesse may also take place when the high card is played first (led), provided the situation is such that only the last Opponent to play to the trick really has, an opportunity to win it, if he holds the card you are finessing against. The following two suit holdings illustrate this type of finesse.|

Is it possible, then, to play the combination of Ace and two small in one hand, with Queen and two small in the other hand, to make 2 tricks? It is, and next is how it is done. |up|4|

It should be evident that the only way the Queen can win a trick is either for East to lead, or for East to be made to play before the South hand - as when a small heart is led from Dummy (North) toward the guarded Queen. Here the object is not to capture the King, but to prevent it from capturing your Queen!|

How does this differ from the example in which it was proper to lead the Queen toward the Ace? Ah, when this was the correct way to finesse, you should have noticed that the Jack or Ten was also held. In other words, when a finesse may be correctly made by leading the card finessed, another card is also held in sequence with it, and hence equal to it in trick-taking value, so that if the card led is killed by being covered, no tricks are lost by the sacrifice, and control of the suit is still retained. A moment's thought will clarify this for you.|

The current suit distribution is an extension of the principle that you can profitably finesse a card by leading it only when you hold another card in sequence with it:|

Now you may lead the Queen, hoping that West has the King, for if the Queen is covered, and you win with Dummy's Ace, you still have the Jack left to control the suit. By leading the Queen, you successfully finesse against West's King, for whether West plays the King or plays low, you must make 2 diamond tricks. You cannot make 3 diamond tricks, because West's Ten will win the third round no matter what you do, assuming that the King is played on the Queen. |

You can readily prove this by trying the various plays yourself. The best procedure, then, is for you to finesse your Queen, and take your Ace, abandoning the suit for attacking purposes, since 2 tricks are all you can get out of it.|

The Ten, it appears, may be a very vital card. Suppose we merely interchange the Ten and the seven-spot in the next example:|

Now you may finesse twice against the King - first by leading the Queen toward the Ace, and, if it holds, following with the Jack, for you still hold the Ten if the Jack is covered and you are forced to win with Dummy's Ace. Put another way, it is profitable to finesse by leading an honor in such a way that it may be covered only if the next lower card is held, which will thereby be promoted to command of the suit.|

You should form the habit of regarding finessing as a method of winning tricks, and not as a method of eliminating the missing higher card. Ask yourself: Can I win 2 tricks with this combination if the position of the outstanding higher card is favorable, or will this method of play gain a trick, or will it establish the cards held by the Opponents if I am forced to play my highest card to win the trick?|
