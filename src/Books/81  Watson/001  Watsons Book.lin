You can return back here (to Watson's Book) via the  |cp|8|at|^*b^*uB^*n^*books^*n|fp||cp||at|  on the menubar above (top left).

The two sections of the book have been split into their chapters.  See the INDEX in the dark grey bar on the left.   Clicking on a chapter will jump you to it.

|cp|gr|at|^*bBookmarks ^*n|cp||at| @- the Bookmarks system is there so that you can remember and return to interesting places in the text. Look in the menubar above (top left).

The  |cp|gr|at|^*bNavigation Bar^*n|cp||at|  is the cream and grey line, with bobbles on it, at the bottom of this window. Clicking anywhere on the bar will move you that point in the current chapter.
