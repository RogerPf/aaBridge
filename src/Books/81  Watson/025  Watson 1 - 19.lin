qx|19B01, Elementary Defense |
nt||HT|e|at|^B@2^Y@3T|FP||AT|he reader may be amazed to observe that defensive play has taken up two chapters and not progressed beyond the first trick. As a matter of fact, however, the principles outlined for the first trick apply with practically equal force to the subsequent tricks. Except insofar as subsequent leads and plays may be modified by better knowledge of where the outstanding cards lie, the conventional leads and plays already explained for the opening trick apply just as much to any later trick.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


AT|

As is true of play by the Declarer, not all the tricks won by the Defending Side can be secured with high cards. What may be regarded as the really important tricks will be won with low honors which have been promoted or with low cards which have been established. To secure these tricks should always be the primary object of every defensive lead and play.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|

As already pointed out, the Defending Side has one advantage. They gain one time unit from the privilege of making the opening lead. Except when a short suit is opened, this first lead is an attacking move, made for the purpose of establishing low-card tricks as quickly as possible. When the lead is a high honor (from a sequence), it will often turn out that the Declarer holds but one or two stoppers in the suit, and the high honor lead will drive out one of these stoppers without more ado. When the Defending Side succeeds in pulling a stopper out of the Declarer's hand, they have accomplished half their purpose. They need only one or two entry cards in order to regain the lead and run off their established low cards.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


NT||
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%5
HT|e|at|^B@2^Y@3N|FP||AT|aturally, when the Declarer holds two stoppers, one lead in that suit is not sufficient to achieve the aim of the Defending Side. When they regain the lead, it is necessary to revert to the original line of attack and lead this suit a second time - letting the Declarer take 2 tricks with his stoppers so that the suit will be cleared. To do this effectively, the Partners must cooperate. Nothing can be more wasteful - of both time and cards - than a policy of leading first one suit and then another. |
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


AT|

If the Declarer is a sound player, he will not have undertaken a no-trump contract without stoppers in all suits, so that to shift from one to another will not make the Declarer lose control of any of them. The first principle of defensive play at no-trump may then be stated as follows: Partner's suit should be returned at the first opportunity whenever there is reason to believe that it can eventually be established. The following deal illustrates this principle:|

Your own suit, hearts, looks more than tempting. However, the chances are that Declarer holds two stoppers in hearts. And you know that just one more lead is required for the Declarer to set up the rest of Dummy's diamonds. Consequently you cannot expect to regain the lead more than once. |
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Your Partner opened the spade suit, showing some length in that suit. Of course, the King still remains in the Dummy, and this is the commanding card, but if this controlling card is driven out, your Partner will very likely be left with some high spades.
|
PG| ***** 13 ***** |


NT|
^B@2Your best clue to the proper play depends on applying the Rule of Eleven, which tells you that Declarer held originally one card higher than the six-spot. But he has already played it - the Ace on the first trick. Therefore, if you knock that King out of Dummy's hand, all Partner's spades will be high. Surely you have no cause for hesitation - you return a spade.|

^B@2The Declarer finds himself in quicksand. He can take his 2 clubs tricks, his sure diamond trick, and his heart trick - giving him a total of 6 tricks, since he has won that second round of spades, willy-nilly with Dummy's King.

^-|cp||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3G|FP||AT|ranted that it is vitally important to return Partner's opening lead, the choice of the card to return is sometimes not easy to make. In the example deal just given, you have a choice between the five-spot and the eight-spot.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


AT| Which should you lead back? You should lead the eight, because it is the highest card you have and clears up any doubt which Partner may have as to the outstanding high cards. In this particular deal it is not very important, since Partner holds all the high cards himself, but if he is confronted with the problem of locating all the missing intermediate cards, he will know that he cannot count on you for anything higher - if you always follow the sound principle, in returning Partner's suit, ^*Ialways to lead back your higher remaining card whenever you held three cards originally^*N.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


AT| This is always important, but it has special significance when the combination held by Third Hand is something like |cp|8|at|Ace-Queen-small|cp||at|, |cp|8|at|Ace-Jack-small|cp||at|, or a |cp|8|at|similar tenace|cp||at|. With such a holding you must be very sure to return the honor, not the low card, after winning the first round with the Ace. In fact, to do this will very often embarrass the Declarer exceedingly.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


AT|

The play not only enables Partner to locate the missing cards higher than your second highest, but it also serves to unblock the suit by getting your high cards out of Partner's way. The unblocking is of little consequence when your choice is between the eight and the seven, but it is of great consequence when you hold two or more honors.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


AT|

With four cards of Partner's opening suit, however, the situation takes on a different hue. You do not need to hurry about unblocking, for you can do this later. Also, it is not so imperative to give your Partner information as to the missing high cards since, if Partner's lead indicates at least four cards in the suit (as it very likely does), you and your Partner hold most of the controlling cards together. But it is important that you tell your Partner that he has hit upon a fairly good length in your hand - such as four or more cards. The following deal demonstrates the return lead from four cards:|

^B@2However, West cannot know whether the Jack is alone or accompanied by a small card. In other words, he will not know whether his best play is to put you in the lead again (if he can), so that you can lead through Declarer's hand a second time in hearts, or whether he should play his King immediately, hoping to drop the missing Jack.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


SK||NT|^B@2
The clue to the mystery - that is, mystery so far as Partner is concerned - lies in the card of his suit that you return. Since you held four hearts originally, you should not return the eight, but the three - the card that was originally your fourth best in the suit. When Declarer plays the nine your Partner will win with the Ten and now he can tell that Declarer holds only one more heart, the lone Jack. Consequently he will promptly lay down his King and drop the unguarded Jack.|

NT||at|^B@2^Y@3T|FP||AT|wo more interesting points characterize the deal just analyzed. |
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


AT| The first is the question of your proper play on the third round of hearts. You still have remaining the eight- and five-spot, and you know that Partner originally held at least four hearts. His four must have included the seven-spot, or he would not have played the King immediately.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If he held four, which card you play can make no difference; but if he held five, your play is very important. If you play the five spot on the third round, your eight will be the highest outstanding heart and will win the fourth round. This will completely shut out Partner's fifth heart, which is good, and he will never be able to cash it in. |
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT|^B@2
To provide for the contingency that Partner may have held five hearts originally, you must play your eight on the third round. Then you can play the five on Partner's seven, and his deuce will be good for a trick.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Thus, every heart you played was important - first the Queen,|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


AT| to make sure of driving out Declarer's stopper;|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


AT| second the trey, to tell Partner that you held originally four cards in the suit;|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


AT| and third the eight on the King, to unblock the suit.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This is excellent defense - cooperating with Partner to give him the correct count on the hand, and getting out of his way. |
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The second interesting point is how West knew that the trey showed an original holding of four rather than only two hearts. After all, the trey might have been your only card. The answer is simple.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you had held only two hearts, the Declarer must have held five. Certainly if the Declarer had held five headed by Ace-Jack, he would have bid the suit some time during the auction. Since he did not ever call hearts, let us say, he must have held only three, and you had four.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Almost invariably a clue like this will enable Partner to read your return lead correctly - if you follow established conventions, as recommended here. If no clue is available, you must merely hope that your Partner guesses aright!|

^-|cp||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3S|FP||AT|ometimes, to avoid blocking Partner's suit, it is necessary to return the highest card even from an original holding of four cards. But this happens only when an honor sequence is present. Take, for example, the following:

1. @D K Q J 3 ^G2. @D Q J 10 2 ^K3.@D J 10 9 4|

AT|

In each situation, if Partner opens diamonds against a no-trump contract, |cp|8|at|you should play the bottom card of the sequence|cp||at|. Then, if you regain the lead, you cannot return your original fourth best because this is certain to block the suit if Partner held five cards originally. The play here is |cp|8|at|to lead back your top card and follow it on the next round with the next highest, reserving the low card to put Partner in the lead if he should hold one more diamond than you|cp||at|.|

^-|
CS||cp||fp||at|^B@2^Y@3Y|FP||AT|ou will recall that three forms of play were useful to the Declarer in the early chapters about no-trump play, namely, the hold-up, unblocking, and ducking. Every one of these is equally useful to the Defending Side.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


AT|

The hold-up is the simplest. The Declarer holds up in order to shut off communication between the two Defending Hands and try to render one of them void of the suit they are trying to establish. The defensive player who employs the hold-up does it for exactly the same reason - to shut off communication between the Declarer's hand and Dummy's hand.  The following deal is an illustration:|

You now consider yourself in the West position. Opening the six of hearts against South's three no-trump contract, you watch the five played from Dummy and the Ace played by Partner, Declarer dropping the four-spot.|

Your only chance of getting the most out of your heart suit is to refuse to overtake the Jack at the second trick. You duck by playing the trey, hoping that your Partner will be able to obtain the lead once more and return his third heart.|

As it happens, Partner does regain the lead with his diamond King, and returns the deuce of hearts, which you win with the King, South having been forced to play his Queen. The heart suit is established with a vengeance, and you run off 2 more tricks.|

By leading the trey, which your Partner wins with the Ace, you will be forced to pass up Declarer's play of the Jack on Partner's return of the Ten. You must do this because if you led a third round of the suit you would plunge right into Declarer's Queen-seven, losing 2 tricks in the suit instead of but 1.|

In returning Partner's opening suit, you learned always to return the highest card left in your hand from an original holding of three, but what was the fourth beat from an original holding of four or more (except when an honor sequence is held, when the highest honor must be returned to guard against blocking the suit if Partner held five cards originally).|
PG| ***** 142 ***** |

The application of the hold-up, unblocking, and ducking were tied up with defensive play, showing that they are as valuable to the Defending Side, on occasion, as to the Attacking Side, on other occasions.
