qx|10B01,UNBLOCKING - Chapter X|
nt||HT|e|at|^b@2^z@3Passing now to the phase of play known as unblocking, you are really taking up an extended phase of an old subject, namely, entries. The underlying principle of an unblocking play is so to arrange a hand that it will contain sufficient entries for you to cash in whatever established cards that hand contains. What we call unblocking is nothing more nor less than the best means of accomplishing this result. Three simple types of unblocking situations are shown below:|
pg| ***** 1 ***** |

^C @d K Q J 10 2 ^k@d A Q J 10 2  ^p@d A K J 10 2
^C @d A 8 ^K@d K 8 ^P@d Q 8

Disregarding the rest of the hand entirely, assume that you find it necessary to cash in the tricks you have in diamonds in each of these situations. (|cp|8|at|Move Maker:|CP||AT| see a footnote by Sam Fry, Jr. later.)|cp||at| |
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


AT|

Notice that in each one, if you lead the eight-spot from your own hand (South) and win with a card in Dummy, you must lead to the second round from Dummy, and, if you lead a card which you win with the lone high card remaining in your hand, you have blocked yourself in diamonds. In other words, having won the second round in your hand, the lead is now there and you have no more small diamonds to lead to Dummy's set up cards. If you have no entries in  any other suit, the diamonds in Dummy are then worthless to you. What is worse, the blocking has been your own fault. All you have to do to unblock yourself in all three situations is to ^*Ilead the honor first^*N from your own hand,  following it with the eight-spot on the second round.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |

It is an excellent idea to get in the habit of unblocking;|

^-|FP||fp|2|CP|8|CS||AT|^B@2^Y@3^*B*^*N |CP||fp||AT|The fact that the word hand is used in two ways in Bridge terminology is often confusing to the beginner. Usually, a player's hand consists of the thirteen cards dealt him originally, and continues to be called the hand at any point during the play as long as any cards remain unplayed by that player. In this sense, there are four hands around the table. The word is also used in a larger sense to mean a complete deal of four hands. To avoid confusion, the word deal or the term complete deal is frequently employed in this work to mean all four hands. Otherwise the context shows clearly which sense is meant.|

^*B*|cp||at| ^*ILest the reader become suspicious, let it be said here that not all hands are played at three no-trump. It so happens that, in illustrating no-trump play (which logically precedes suit play), a deal showing a legitimate contract of three no-trump is the most natural situation for bringing out the effectiveness of various principles. - Sam Fry, Jr.^*N|

NT|^B@2
You may now stop and consider to your heart's content, for you have avoided any possibility of blocking yourself in clubs later on. Your long diamond suit of eight cards looks dazzling, but you cannot try to develop it because the Opponents hold five diamonds between them - and every one of those five diamonds is higher than every one of yours except the Ace and King. |
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Obviously, |cp|8|at|the greatest number of adversely held diamonds that will fall on your Ace-King leads is four; in other words, to lead two rounds of diamonds is sure to present the Opponents with a diamond trick.|cp||at| You cannot afford to let them have this, for they will still hold five good spades between them, at least three of which (and probably four) they will be able to make. Any notion of developing diamonds is therefore squelched at once. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT|^B@2	
The next best bet - in fact, the best bet - is the club suit. To make good on your clubs you must enter Dummy's hand. The Ace of hearts will accomplish this all right, but, speaking of hearts, what about that sequence of Queen-Jack-Ten? And the nine in Dummy? A heart finesse seems simple - and alluring. If it works, we can add 3 or 4 heart tricks to all those club tricks and make about 12 tricks!|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||at|^*B
^-One thing you should have learned by this time, however, is that in Contract Bridge it never pays to be too greedy.
The player who gorges himself every time he sits down to the Bridge table,
always hoping that he will gulp down all the tricks before his Opponents even get started,
finds that the occasions when he is interrupted and starved (defeated)
more than offset the times when he succeeds.
^*N^-|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Though it is true that the finesse in hearts may succeed, there is an equal chance that it will fail. If it fails, the Opponents will cash in their good spades at once, and will probably defeat your contract. In other words, you are betting a practically sure game (three No-trump) against the possibility of making at most 110 extra points.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You have already taken 1 spade trick and 1 club trick; you can surely take 2 diamond tricks, 1 heart trick, and almost surely 5 club tricks. Your count of clubs should show you that the Opponents have left only four clubs between them. You control three more rounds of that suit (Ace-King-Jack). Your three leads will drop all the adverse clubs unless all four of them are in one hand, which is the worst of all possible distributions. |

NT|^B@2
A 4-0 division of the adverse clubs is extremely unlikely, however; the chances are about ^*Itwenty to one against it^*N. Mathematically stated, your chance of making your contract by being content with 1 heart trick and at once leading the clubs is about 95% certain, while the heart finesse is only 50% certain. The percentage is all in favor of spurning the heart finesse as too risky and taking the almost sure game that immediately cashing in clubs offers.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


SK||NT|^B@2
As you can see from the diagram, the contract is made this way without difficulty. As soon as both Opponents follow suit on the Ace of clubs your fears are over. But if you had taken the heart finesse, East would have won the trick and returned a spade giving his partner 4 more spade tricks, and you would have been set 2 tricks.

West's opening lead against your three no-trump contract is the spade Queen. |
PG| ***** 29 ***** |

Your first decision must be in which hand you should retain an entry in spades, since you have one in each. You see that the Dummy is the hand which contains the greater length of the only establishable suit (hearts), and therefore win the trick with the King in your hand, leaving the spade Ace in Dummy for an entry. (Note that no hold-up in spades is necessary, for you hold more spades than your Opponents though you cannot expect to win more than 2 tricks in the suit.)|

NT|^B@2
You have discarded your two small spades and three little diamonds on the last five rounds of hearts led from Dummy's hand. Your contract is safe, for you have 2 more tricks in those Aces looming in your own hand. However, there is that club finesse, which looks tempting. |
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If East has the club King, why not enjoy grabbing that extra trick? Probably you think you should not jeopardize your contract by taking that finesse when all you have to do is cash in the two Aces to be home. |
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Of course, you should not jeopardize your contract at any time in exchange for a sure thing. But look at this situation again. You recall that just a few tricks ago we decided that the Opponents had left 2 spade tricks at the most. |
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Your count of spades proved this. They have won already only the Ace of hearts, so that, even if the club finesse fails (falling to West's King, if he has that card), the greatest number of tricks the Opponents can take is 4 (1 heart trick, 2 spade tricks, 1 club trick), for you still retain control of the two unplayed suits (diamonds and clubs.)|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Here, then, you should by all means take the club finesse, for it does not place your contract in jeopardy. You take no chances. You merely play to make an extra trick if the location of the club King is favorable, and you ^*Ilose nothing^*N if it is not. |
PG| ***** 59 ***** |

As it happens, East has the club King, so you risk nothing and gain a trick by finessing. If there had been even the remotest possibility that West could take 3 spade tricks, it would have been insane to take the club finesse.

If both Opponents follow suit each time, a count of diamonds shows you that eight cards have been played, and you still hold four. This means that the Opponents can hold but one more diamond. You can therefore lead the nine and overtake it with Dummy's King, retaining the trey in your hand. |

This lowly three-spot will enable you to enter the Dummy in diamonds by leading your low card to Dummy's high eight. That eight-spot was a hidden entry which you uncovered by your manner of playing the diamond suit.|

The second situation illustrates the same principle. The technique is exactly the same as that applied in the first situation, if you wish to find two extra entries in the Dummy. You lead your Ace and King so that, if both Opponents follow suit on both rounds of spades, you will succeed in your purpose. |

In the second situation just analyzed, if it were important for you to enter your own hand three times, and the Dummy were otherwise well supplied with entries, this unblocking play in spades would be unnecessary. The Ace, King, and Jack in your hand serve very easily as entries, and the complication of the overtaking play in Dummy would not take place.|

The whole point here is that unblocking in this fashion is for the purpose of establishing entries ^*Iif those entries are needed^*N. The suits just  considered may be played whichever way is most desirable. You need only estimate how many entries you require in each hand and play accordingly.|

The player who blocks himself in one hand or the other through failure to look ahead, is akin to the fellow who paints himself into a corner, or to the chap who sits on the outer edge of a limb to saw it from the main trunk. In this connection, whenever a solid or nearly solid suit is split between the partnership hands, you should lead in a such a way that on the trick which exhausts the shorter hand the lead will remain in the longer hand.|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |

Finally you learned that application of unblocking may not always have for its object the cashing in of the tricks in the suit in which the unblocking occurs. Unblocking may also be used to develop entries in one hand or the other.

^c@2^Y@3A|FP||CP||AT|dditional notes on "normal distribution" of suits. 

- If six cards are outstanding, they are more likely to be divided 4-2 (around 50%) than 3-3 (around 35%). 
- If 4 cards outstanding, they are more likely to be divided 3-1 (around 50%) than 2-2 (around 40%).  

The general rule is, with an odd number of cards outstanding, the most probable distribution is for them to be divided as evenly as possible (4-3, 3-2, 2-1). 

With an even number of cards outstanding, an even distribution (3-3, 2-2) is not the most probable distribution (although it is still somewhat likely); the most probable distribution is for one defender to have two more cards than the other defender (4-2, 3-1). 

On the very rare occasions when you have 11 cards between the 2 hands, the cards are equally likely to be divided 1-1 or 2-0.|
