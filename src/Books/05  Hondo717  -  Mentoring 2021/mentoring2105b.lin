PG| ***** 41 ***** |


mb|2S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With 10 HCP (the @HJ should be discounted on this auction) and a doubleton, it is certainly reasonable for West to bid 3@S. But, on most hands, East's takeout double means East almost always has only 4 spades. |
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So East/West are probably in an 8 card fit and East's double could easily be just competitive rather than showing an opener. Therefore, although I think 3@S is reasonable and probably what I call since the @CK appears well placed behind the club bidder, I think 2@S is okay also.|

CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=lott,Law of Total Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at| should compete to 3@H right away. 3@H is NOT a game try. It is just competing.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I understand North's reluctance but the Law Of Total Tricks is paramount although many players would pass 2@S. Letting the opponents play at the 2 level with an 8 card fit on a competitive hand is losing bridge in the long run.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


mb|3H?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West freely bid 2@S. So, if nothing else, East knows they have a 9 card fit. And, again using the Law of Total Tricks, 3@S is the minimum East should bid.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Remember, HCP are only a small part of how strong your hand is, particularly when you have great distribution and a fit. That sure justifies a 4@S bid.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Someone asked me a good question. Why am I using Declarer Points to count the East hand when in fact East is going to be dummy on this hand. The reason is because although technically East is dummy, the hand with the longer trump counts Declarer Points.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This occurs frequently when there is a transfer bid after a 1NT opener. In general, the hand with longer trump is Declarer because they bid the suit first. But occasionally, such as on this hand and after a transfer bid, the hand with the long trumps is dummy.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So Declarer Points is a slight misnomer. You should think of "Declarer Points" for hand with longer trump points. In any case East has a clear 4@S bid which again, illustrates the power of distribution and fit.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


mb|4S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East needs to be a bit more optimistic. East is thinking too many negative thoughts such as "my trumps are weak", "I am vul and they are not."|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Optimistic bidders do well. Surely, the trump are puny. But you have a 9 card fit. So even if West has no spade honors (which is extremely unlikely) and if spades break 2-2 you only have 2 spade losers.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, if West has as little as Axxx in spades, and if spades break 2-2 that is only 1 loser. A 9-card fit means your trumps are not "weak" regardless of honors. Regardless, East has a clear 4@S bid.|

PG| ***** 57 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is unlikely we have 2 spade tricks, but a club still looks like the best defense. After I lead a club, West must do some planning. The best way to play the hand is to set up diamonds which means you want to preserve entries to dummy.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On my club lead, West should win the @CK, plays 2 rounds of trump, lead diamonds, ruff a 3rd diamond. If diamonds don't break 3-3, lead a club to the carefully preserved @CA and ruff another diamond and claim, losing a spade at worst.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not to mention the nice club 10 and 9 given I opened 1@C although it turns out on this hand they are not especially helpful.|
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, I also have a difficult decision to chose my bid. I love my 3 quick tricks and the QJ10 of diamonds. So I guess we have at worst 25 points and possibly 26. Therefore, 3N seems right.|
