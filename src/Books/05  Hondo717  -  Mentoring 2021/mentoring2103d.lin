up|29|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 3@H we lose 3 hearts (maybe 2 if North guesses correctly) 1 diamond and 1 club for a likely -50 or possibly +140. In either case +150 is better.|
PG| ***** 14 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, 3@C is the LOTT bid with a known 9 card club fit. You should always follow LOTT in competition as it is right most of the time. And despite the -150, it actually didn't work out that badly in IMPs (despite the fact that East had a very marginal 2@C bid) since we do make 2@H (110 so only a 1 imp loss). |
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And, had West bid 3@C right away, it is quite possible that North, with a singleton club and 6 nice hearts, might have decided to compete to 3@H. But once West passes and North gets the chance to bid 2@H, it is clear for North to pass 3@C. |
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So bidding 3@C right away puts a lot more pressure on North. The idea in competitive bidding is to pressure your opponents when you can because they will often make incorrect decisions.|

But first, a couple of things about the West hand. First of all you need to learn how to bid when you are 5-4 in the majors opposite a 1NT opener.

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are different ways to bid, depending on strength. Here West bids 2@C and if East responds 2@D West would jump to 3@S to show 5 spades, 4 hearts, and a game forcing hand.|S

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people play a convention known as Smolen. Smolen is okay, but only if you remember it and it is very unnatural. All that doesn't apply here. Once East responded 2@H West has a clear 4@H bid. More after the play.|

up|25|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Obviously, East-West should play in hearts. The only question is whether to be in game or slam. Let's count West's declarer points. Starting points are 13 HCP, 1 length point, and 1 quality suit point for a total of 15. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Additionally, you can add 3 points for the singleton with 4-card support which brings the total to 18. Certainly enough to consider slam (which requires at least 33 points between the 2 hands).|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Instead of 4@H, the bid I would make with the West hand is 4@C, which is a splinter showing a singleton or void in clubs. It also shows slam interest. However, 4@C is not what East wants to hear. That means that the @CQ and @CJ are essentially wasted values. |
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The ideal holding in a suit where partner splinters are 3 or 4 small, or 3 or 4 to the ace. Other honors in the suit are minuses because they do not fit well with partner. So over 4@C, East should show no interest in slam and bid 4@H.|
