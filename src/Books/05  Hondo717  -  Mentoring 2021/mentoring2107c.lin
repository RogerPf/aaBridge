up|40|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I agree with North's pass. Unfortunately, my 2@S bid preempted partner rather than the opponents. That does happen on rare occasions. But it should not deter you from preempting.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The @DA was a reasonable lead. So is the @C9. Leading singletons when you have trump control is often a good idea. I probably play @DA, @DK, and a 3rd diamond, hoping partner can ruff.|

mb|1H|mb|P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think pass by North is better than 2@D although the 6-card diamond suit is nice. The 3 hearts in the hand is a big minus. Any time you have 3 cards in an opponents suit, that is a minus. Also the lack of a singleton or void is another minus. |
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, being vul means you need to be a bit more careful. But you should not let being vul deter you too much from bidding.|

mb|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You should strain to "Support with Support." So East should have bid 2@H. With stronger hands with 3-card support, sometimes you have to make another bid rather than supporting directly.|

mb|P|mb|1C|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think 1@C with my hand is best. But I wouldn't hate 3@C. Although I have 12 HCP, my red jacks are pretty dubious. In fact, if I had a singleton spade instead of a singleton heart I would be very tempted to preempt because I don't want the opponents outbidding me in spades.|

up|44|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think pass by North over 2@C was very reasonable. When you have a misfit you want to stop bidding ASAP. But 2@H over 2@C would be okay with the nice 6 card suit headed by the AK. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So in 2@H we would probably be no worse off than in 2@C. And if I had a doubleton heart 2@H would probably be better.|
