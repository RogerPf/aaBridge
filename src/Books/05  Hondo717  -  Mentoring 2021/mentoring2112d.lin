mb|1S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1@S is an okay bid. The hand technically meets the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=ruleof20,Rule of 20^*N|CP||FP||at| (10 cards in majors with 10 HCP) but the @DJ and @CQx are both downgrades.|

mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@C is possible with the North hand though I prefer 1N. Unlike a direct 1N overcall a 1N in the pass out seat shows 11-14.|

mb|1N|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|3N|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3N is a bit of a stretch. If I bid 2N, it is unclear if North should bid 3N. Technically North is on the low end of the range and might pass. However, the nice 5-card suit is probably enough to push him to bid 3N in IMPs. Please note that in Match Points you don't stretch to bid games but in IMPs you do stretch.|
