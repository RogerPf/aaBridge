pc|C3|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is always a problem when one hand is very strong and the other is very weak and that is, transportation to the weak hand is very limited. It is much harder to play the hand in general. Therefore, you should be more conservative when that is the situation. So I would have probably passed 2NT with the North hand since we have at most 24 HCP.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me do some planning. I have 2 clubs, 3 hearts, 1 diamond, and 1 spade. That is 7 and I need 2 more tricks. A 3-3 spades would give me 2 more tricks. I also might be able to set up 1 diamond but not 2. I might get a 3rd club. Although 3-3 spades is not wonderful it seems like my best shot.|

In both Responder with a suitable hand, assuming there is no interference, bids 2NT. The 2NT bid, in both conventions, is 100% forcing.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that, although I love to open Weak-2 bids even with a 4-card major, in 1st and 2nd seat, with this hand holding 5-6 in the majors I would probably pass and come in later because there is too much of a chance you can make 4@H or 4@S and you don't know which.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this hand, although East only has 7 HCP, I would consider that as strong hand. 6-5 is wonderful distribution and the void is also very powerful. So I would respond 3@H (strong hand weak suit).|mb|3h|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, there is another style of Ogust which simply reverses 3@D and 3@H. In this version 3@D shows a good hand and a bad suit and 3@H shows a bad hand and a good suit. I don't think it matters which you play, But obviously you need to check with your partner.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other treatment or convention is ^*BFeature^*n which many good players use. Personally, I prefer Ogust slightly but ^*BFeature^*n is reasonable.|

mb|p?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now West has a bit of a problem. With a weak suit, West knows there are likely at least 2 heart losers and likely to lose 2 more tricks somewhere. So I would pass 3@H  particularly since there is only an 8 card fit. |
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You need to be conservative with 8 card fits though 4@H would not be awful as it turns out. 4@H is likely making because West has 3 very good cards for East and East has a very powerful hand. Regardless, pass is the correct bid.|

up|44|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|let's see how they do in clubs. They lose 1 club, 1 diamond, and 1 spade, and make 4. So even if I went down that is a reasonable result for me. However, they should not be in 4 of a minors.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Rarely is it right to bid "4 over 3" especially if you are not sure if you want to push the opponents into 4 of their major. Therefore, passing 3@S was correct here although it worked out better for me.|

mb|P|mb|1C?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally with 6-5 hands I just bid my 6 card suit because it is likely to play at least equally well in that suit. However, here since my spades are so strong I will treat it as 5-5 and bid Michaels since it is quite possible spades could be better than hearts or at least as good.|mb|2C|an|5-5 in majors|

mb|3C|mb|3S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|5C|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|5@C is a very good bid. East knows they have at least a 10 card fit and perhaps even 11. And East also knows, since NS have a spade fit, partner is short in spades. This is a case where an expert would "picture" what might happen, rather than counting HCP. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If West has the @CK and nothing else at most their side will lose 2 hearts and 1 spade (assuming partner is short in spades). So down 1 at worst, and we can easily make 4@S.|

MB|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally it is not a good idea to bid "5 over 5" though with 5-6 hands you really want to declare. If partner has as little as the @HK or a minor suit ace we are making. And since partner freely bid 3@S, that is somewhat likely. |
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even if not, probably only down 1. So this is a rare instance where I think "5 over 5" is correct although it almost never is.|mb|5S|

mb|1n|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1NT is not correct with a nice 6 card suit. I do believe in opening 1NT with a 5 card major but not a 6 card major. I will also open 1NT occasionally with a 6 card minor but that is because 5 of a minor is rarely better than 3N. |
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And in fact, on this hand, East also has 18 HCP, too many to open 1NT. The hand is closer to a 2NT opener than a 1NT opener. Let me give East an undo.|
