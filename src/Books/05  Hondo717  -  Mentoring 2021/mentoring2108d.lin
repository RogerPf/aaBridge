nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@D shows 4+ diamonds and 10+ points with no upper limit. If they did not play inverted minors, East would have to bid 3NT (12-15 balanced) which is not a terrible way to play. |
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


mb|p?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, I don't like to bid 3N over 1 of a minor if I can help it because it takes up a lot of bidding room and if partner has a strong opener, you could easily miss slam. |
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Uneconomical auctions (auctions where you jump with strength) are not as good. That is the whole idea behind 2/1 game forcing. It lets you establish a game force early at a low level so you have lots of room to explore for your best spot. |
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also, 2@D bid in |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=invertedminors,Inverted Minors^*N|CP||FP||at| denies a 4 card major.

mb|1N|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1NT is the best opening bid and the one that would be chosen by most experienced modern players. These days, virtually every good player will open 1NT with a 5 card major as it is the most descriptive bid.|

mb|4N|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4NT is a great bid by North. It is "^*BUnusual^*n" showing both minors. It gives East a huge problem.|

MB|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally "^*Bthe 5 level belongs to the opponent^*n" is a good principle meaning it is rarely right to bid 5 over 5. But in this case, East knows their side has an 11 card heart fit. However, he also has a small doubleton club. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So they could easily go down in 5 hearts and we could be down in 5 of a minor (probably 5@C). It is not clear what to do. I might pass and see what happens although I don't usually like to give the opponents free reign. And here since it is not clear what to do, I think pass is reasonable.|

up|41|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East/West judged this hand very well. They lose 2 clubs and 1 diamond and are down 1 in 5@H. Many pairs would bid 5@H with their 11 card fit particularly in Match Points, where they are vul and the opponents are not. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, the principle "^*Bthe 5 level belongs to the opponents^*n" is a good one.|
