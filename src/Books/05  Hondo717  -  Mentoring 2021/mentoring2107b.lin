nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In Quick Trick Points, there are 8 possible Quick Tricks (2 in each suit). There are 40 HCP. Therefore, a Quick Trick is worth around 5 points. If your number of Quick Tricks times 5 is equal or more than your actual HCP, your hand is better than its counts.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case, with 3.5 Quick Tricks, East's hand, with only 14 actual HCP, is worth about 17.5 Quick Trick Points meaning East's hand is much better than its HCP indicate.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is because aces and kings are actually worth more than their HCP indicate, especially if in combination and East does have 3.5 Quick Tricks (2 in spades, 1 in clubs, and 0.5 in hearts).|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Note that quick trick points do not change the actual value of your hand from your Bergen Hand Evaluation calculation. But when you have a close decision, you should be much more aggressive when your quick trick points exceed your actual HCP.|

With 5 spades, a singleton heart, and vul against not I think 4@S is reasonable. Another choice is double, which just shows cards, not hearts.
