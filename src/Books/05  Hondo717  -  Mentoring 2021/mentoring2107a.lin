mb|1D|mb|2S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Personallly with East's hand, I would bid 3@S. Always preempt as high as seems reasonable. With a 7 card suit, 3 level preempts are fine.|

So you should strain to bid 3NT even when 5 of a minor isf possible. It is much easier to take 9 tricks than 11 tricks.|

pc|H9|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, so let me plan. I can take 4 clubs, 3 hearts and 2 diamonds for sure. So I will knock out the @CA. In Match Points I would assume East has the @SA and try for an overtrick. But in IMPs I am happy to take 9 tricks. |
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I could also try the diamond finesse in Match Points. But first I will play the club suit.  This way, I can handle a 4-0 break in either hand. I can take my 9 tricks ending up on the table and lead a spade. That way I still might score my @SK.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it turns out we are down 1. But had partner bid 4@C I might have bid 5 and they do make 5@H. So this was a very rare instance where a vulnerable sacrifice works out.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, I agree with West's double. It looks likely West will get the @CA and a spade ruff. And since partner opened, it is likely they have 2 more tricks which would be down 2.|

pc|D4|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think a diamond is the best lead and what I would have chosen as well. I have 4 diamonds, 2 hearts, and 3 clubs for sure. But I can do a bit better if I ruff a club.Also, I need to unblock hearts as well so I can cash the @HA when I get to dummy with a club ruff.|
