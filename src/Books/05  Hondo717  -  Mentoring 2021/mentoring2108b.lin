PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But a better option might have been to save the @CK and duck a spade, in case spades were 3-3. That way West has a chance to make 4 (if one major splits 3-3) or 5 (if 2 majors split 3-3). |
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But as the cards lie it doesn't matter. However, West should try for an overtrick by losing a spade early. "Lose you losers early" is often a good declaring technique.|

pc|H2|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The heart I just led is a suit preference signal. Whenever you are giving partner a ruff on defense, the spot you lead tells partner which of the non trump suits to lead back.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if I lead a low heart, that says lead the lower of the non trump suits (clubs here). If I lead a high heart, that says lead back the higher non trump suit (diamonds).|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here since I have a natural trump trick I don't want a diamond ruff. I want a club back. Therefore, I will lead the @H2 a low heart asking for clubs.|

PG| ***** 37 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, cashing the @CA can't give away a trick even if East has the @CK because it will either fall or partner will be able to get a ruff. Counting out suits is a very important defensive technique you should work on.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another good defensive technique is to not ruff with a good trump unless you need to get in because you want to use your good trump to draw declarer's trump. On this hand it doesn't matter as it turns out.|

cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No. It is not Jacoby 2N. In COMPETITIVE bidding, 2N is known as Jordan 2N. That shows 4+ card support, and 10+ points if partner opens, the next person doubles, and responder bids 2N such as 1@S-X-2NT.|
PG| ***** 99 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Jacoby 2N only applies over a passed call by the opponent such as 1@S-P-2NT.

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I would have bid 3@C with the West hand to show 10+ points and 4-card support. And use 2NT over a takeout double to show a 3-card support. That is not standard but I find it very effective. 3@C shows 10+ with no upper limit, same as Jordan 2N shows no upper limit.|

mb|4H|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|4S?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The auction so far tells South that partner has a weak hand. East opened. South doubled. West showed a strong hand. So North cannot possibly have too much strength. Therefore, with a singleton and 5 hearts, the 4@H bid by North is clear assuming North is confident South won't take her for any strength.|
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now you should normally be very cautious to bid 5 over 4. But in this case I have a clear 5@H bid because of my spade void which is incredibly powerful. The favorable vulnerability (we not vul, they are) is also great.|

As a general rule "^*Bthe 5 level belongs to the opponents^*N" meaning you should not bid "5 over 5" without a good reason. To be fair, West is a little stronger than 2NT promised and their side is vul, and our side is not. So 5@S has some merit. |

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As I said, very difficult decision for West, particularly at this vulnerability. However, as a general rule you should avoid bidding "^*B5 over 5^*n" unless you have a really good reason, which most often is a void in the opponents' suit. Having said that it was rather unlucky that 5@S did not make.|
