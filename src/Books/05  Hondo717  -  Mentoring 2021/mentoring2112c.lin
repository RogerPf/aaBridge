mb|P|mb|2S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some players think you should not open a weak 2 with an outside 4-card major. I disagree. When you have a 6-card suit, it is overwhelmingly likely you want to play in your 6-card suit especially with a weak hand. You should look for reasons to preempt, and avoid reasons not to preempt.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In fact, on this hand, were I not vul or in 2nd seat, I might open 3@S. 6-4-3-0 distribution is wonderful. Please note that on this hand I preempted partner. That is sometimes the case which is why, although you certainly should preempt in 2nd seat, it is not as effective as in other seats.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As a good rule you should definitely avoid marginal preempts in 2nd seat.|

up|44|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The only lead that beats slam, due to the 4-1 club break is a heart and there is no conceivable reason for West to lead a heart given her holding.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I did get a question that if I passed and partner opened 2N, would we get to slam. It is more likely, though I am still not sure we would get there. We have a very good fit though there is no way to work that out.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, if I pass and partner opens 2N, I might very well just transfer to spades. If we played Texas Transfer, I might bid 3@H and bid 4@S over 3@S. The 2N-3@H-3@S-4@S, as opposed to 2N-4@H-4@S, is a mild slam try.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even then, I am not sure North would go on.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other question from the table was whether North could open 2@C and rebid 2N. Bergen himself would say yes. With 20 HCP + 1 for quality clubs + 1 for 5 card suit giving me 22 Bergen Points, I personally would still open 2N.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I only stretch my NT openers if my Bergen Points are 2 higher. So if my Bergen Points came to 23, I would consider that a 2@C followed by 2N opener. With only 22 Bergen Points, I am only 1 point over. That is my criterion. |
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bergen loves to stretch his NT openers. That is one of the few areas where I disagree with him. Of course he has won 11 national championships and I have won none.|

mb|p3s|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The transfer and 3@S bids are fine. However, given his great spades I might venture a 4@S bid. If I had AK10x of spades it would be clear to bid 4@S even if partner had zilch. With only 3 spades, it is not nearly as clear. Let us give West an undo.|

North should continue with the @DJ not the @DQ. That gives partner more information. Partner already knows you have the queen.

PG| ***** 72 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So say you have 5 points. That means partner on average will have around 15 points. Those 15 points are well positioned behind the NT opener. Whereas say I had 13 points a lot of my points would be poorly positioned in front of the NT bidder.|

Some think that leading a major on this sort of auction is a good idea. Even if that is your preference, I would have chosen a heart, because of the intermediate hearts. Of course, North is smarter than me and made the lead which works best here.|

Regardless, I can not worry about it because on this auction it is very unlikely I have a spade stopper because my 3@H bid is likely based on spade shortness.|

up|24|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Again notice the power of distributional hands for both North and South. South has only 13 HCP and North only has 6 yet we are cold for 4@H with 19 HCP between us.|
