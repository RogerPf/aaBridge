^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, 1N is imperfect. But it is less imperfect than double. Double promises at least 3 card support in all unbid suits. |
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, 1N is not likely to get you in too much trouble, whereas double might when partner bids clubs. You should strain to open and overcall 1N whenever you can. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With 1N overcalls, sometimes you have to compromise a bit. 1N bids give partner a pretty good description of what you have and usually result in accurate auctions.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@C = weak hand weak suit
3@D = weak hand strong suit
3@H = strong hand weak suit (which I would bid with this hand)
3@S = strong hand strong suit
3N = hand with top three honors - AKQxxx. It is very rare.|
