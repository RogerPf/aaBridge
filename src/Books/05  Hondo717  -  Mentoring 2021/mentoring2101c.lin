mb|1S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1@S is reasonable bid. But personally I would open 4@S as that is very likely to be the correct contract and you make it hard for the opponents to bid.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The risk of preempting 4@S with an opening hand is that you occasionally might miss a slam. But with this hand in particular, with no outside aces or kings, it is very unlikely that your side has slam. |
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And even with a slightly stronger hand, it is still unlikely your side has slam. By jumping to what is almost certainly your best contract, you make it much more difficult for the opponents to compete.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North really needed to count tricks at trick 1. With the opening lead North has 4 diamonds for sure. If clubs break 3-2 North has 5 clubs. If not the hand gets a little tricky.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Playing one heart was fine. But first you needed to test clubs by playing the @CA and @CQ. If clubs are 3-2 then you can play a heart. If not you must play the @CJ and hope East has the @HA. |
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The way North played it, if East had started with Jxx of hearts, North will lose 2 spades and 3 hearts and go down, Admittedly they have to find that defense, and many players would not.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So remember, although I am a big fan of 4th best leads, if the opponents have bid the suit, usually it is not a good idea to lead that suit. So on this hand, a low spade is best which doesn't help as it turns out.|

PG| ***** 47 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good question. The ACBL does allow you to open 1NT with a singleton A, K, or Q and these days many players do. In general I do not. |
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, if you would like on this hand I would make an exception to my dislike of opening 1NT with a singelton, since if it starts 1@D (P) 1@H or 1@S, I don't like a 2@C rebid as I can't show my strength.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, if you were going to rebid 1N over my 1@H or 1@S you should have opened 1N in the first place. At that point, 1N is a very big underbid. So if you choose to open 1@D, you must either rebid 2@C or 2N or else open 1N to start with.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As a general rule, when you have an unclear opening bid try to imagine how the auction might go and choose the bid that makes the auction go as smoothly as possible.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*N ^*NWouldn't 1NT open get into trouble if South transfers to hearts?|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes 1N opener is risky if responder transfers to hearts which is another argument against it, and why I don't like it in general.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |

PG| ***** 55 ***** |


mb|4H|mb|D?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You have to bid 4@S. I told you to pick whichever major you prefer and you clearly prefer spades. Also West, although expecting to set 4@H should not double. If North wasn't sure whether to pass or bid 4@S, West just made the decision easy. So West should pass and maybe we end up in 4@H, which West would love. Whereas West not thrilled about playing in 4@S.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good defense. Unlucky hand with all of those bad breaks. The contract was fine. Note however, that if North rebids 2@C over 1@S I have a big problem. I can't bid 2@H as that is 4th suit forcing to game. And I don't want to play in 2@C or 2@D. So I probably rebid 2@S in which case North should bid 4@S and we end up in the same place.|

mb|P|mb|1N|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Many players with my hand might bid Stayman and that would not be unreasonable. But as a general rule, if you have a 6 card major and a 4 card major particularly when partner opens 1N and is known to have at least 2 in one of the majors, playing in the 6-2 card major is almost always as good and often better than playing in a 4-4 fit. |
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although, some people say that playing in a 4-4 fit is better than playing in a 5-3 or 6-2. That is not really true because when you have an 8 card fit with 4-4 you get a 4-1 break about 1/3 of the time and you don't like that. Whereas if playing in a 5-3 or 6-2 fit, a 4-1 break doesn't bother you as much. So it is safer.|

UP|32|nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*NWhat is the advantage of Texas Transfer?|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One of the reasons you do transfers is to let the strong hand be declarer which has some advantages on opening lead. The strong hand has more honors which are protected on opening lead.|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example if declarer has Kx in a suit, and the lead is in that suit, the K is now guaranteed to be a trick. So when you have a 6-card major and partner opens 1N and you have game forcing values you can make a transfer at the 4 level known as Texas Transfer.|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BSame Kib: ^*NWhat about regular transfer then jump to 4@H?|
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You could do that and nothing wrong with playing that way. But that is a "mild slam try" if bid 2@D and then jump to 4@H. In that case partner, with a nice heart fit and some aces and kings might bid RKCB to see if slam is possible.|
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also if you don't play Texas Transfer you need to decide what 1N-2@D-2@H-4N auction means. I think it should be RKCB. But some play it as quantitative: which I think is silly.|
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But if you play Texas tansfer then in 1N-4@D-4@H-4N auction, the 4N is RKCB.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you play DONT, then a double over 1N shows a 1 suited hand which promises a 6-card suit. But at this vul (EW not, NS is) I would cheat and double with my nice 5-card club suit.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very lucky to make 3N. So passing 1N was 100% correct. If West does make a |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dont,DONT^*N|CP||FP||at| double and East will end up playing 2@C because it will go 1N-Dbl-P-2@C (pass or correct to your suit)-All pass we end up taking 2 hearts, 2 clubs, a diamond trick, and 3 spades.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You look at preempts incorrectly. Tthey are a risk vs. reward bid. The reward for making it hard for the opponents far outweighs the risk.|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you wait for hands with perfect preempts you will hardly ever preempt and give up a great offensive weapon of bidding.|

PG| ***** 120 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It just says, "partner I have a good hand", do something intelligent. It does not promise 4 hearts as I said it is not takeout. It just shows a good hand.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Often I will pass. But if I had a long suit and no defense I might bid. And here I have a problem. I have to pass though I have no defense and they could easily be making the 4@S.|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


MB|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That, once again, is why you preempt because you make the opponents guess what to do and they often guess wrong.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@S doubled making will be a great result. Normally on these hands a trump lead is often right after partner doubles because we have the majority of the strength. It turns out a trump lead works here and does not give away a trick. |
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, with my holding of @SQ9x I can't lead a trump because it will often give away a trick. I might sometimes lead a doubleton hoping for a ruff.|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But with my trump holding I could easily have a natural trump trick. So I am going to lead the @CJ.|

UP|37|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you can see we guessed wrong. We should sacrifice in 5@C. But no one did anything wrong. It just shows the value of preempting. Had East passed I doubt we end up in 4@S and certainly not doubled.|
