up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although 3@S was a possible bid, I think East has better choices. As usual, preempts cause opponents to guess. Personally I would bid 4@D which is Michaels. East is a bit weak for a 4 level Michaels bid particularly the heart suit.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Regardless, I think 4@D gives you the best chance of getting a good result plus it describes East's hand. Then West bids 4@H which is a much better contract|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 4@H if North leads the @DA, 4@H is also down. The @DA could very well be the best lead since North doesn't want to lead a spade since East showed spades by bidding Michaels. A heart is possible lead too in which case 4@H might make.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A double is also a possible bid by East. The problem is partner might very well bid clubs. However, as it turns out if East doubles, West should pass. But I personally prefer 4@D because it describes East's distribution better.|

PG| ***** 46 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2NT is not correct. 2NT is not unusual over a weak-2. It is natural showing a strong NT  -  with a spade stopper here.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Double is a good possibility although North only has 3 hearts, But the hearts are very nice and that is what I would choose.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another possibility is 3@D which is better than 3@C because with 2 equal suits you tend to bid the higher one first. That allows you to bid the lower one next and partner can correct to the higher one if need be at the same level.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if North chose not to double, 3@D is better than 3@C.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other possibility is 4NT. That is unusual and takeout for the minors. But on this hand I like double best.|mb|D|

mb|3S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|After 2 passes, North should definitely not sell out and should double again. The spade void is huge and the 3@S bid just about guarantees N/S have a fit somewhere.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We have a fit somewhere because if they have a 9 card fit mathematically that means we must have a fit. Let me explain the math.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We have 26 cards between our 2 hands. If they have a 9 card fit, we only have 4 cards in their suit. That means we have 22 cards in the other 3 suits which means we must have at least one 8 card fit.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You need not remember that math. Just remember "if they have a fit we have a fit."|

up|44|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand shows why voids are so powerful. Basically, a void means 10 of the opponents HCP are useless and we are playing with a 30 point deck. Notice we only have 19 HCP between us and yet we made a small slam. Granted, it was very lucky that we made a small slam but 5@D is just about cold.|

mb|p|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Drury is a convention that some players use over third or fourth seat opener of 1@H or 1@S. The player who is using Drury is a passed hand. The best Drury is called Two-Way Reverse Drury.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If partner opens 1@H or 1@S in 3rd seat or 4th seat, 2@C and 2@D responses are artificial. 2@C shows 10-12 points and 3 card support and 2@D shows 10-12 points and 4 card support.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Opener's rebid over 2@C shows whether opener has a light opening bid or a normal opening bid. On this hand the 2@D rebid showed a normal opening bid.|

mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|mb|1S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would have passed with the North hand in 4th seat. I dislike 11 HCP flat hands and I dislike the spades. But many would open using |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=ruleof15,Rule of 15^*N|CP||FP||at| which I am not a big fan of.

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|^*BThe rule of 15^*N says you should open in 4th seat if your HCP + spades are 15 or more. So using that rule, with 11 HCP + 5 spades = 16, North has an opener. But as I said I don't particularly care for that rule.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you see, opening light in 4th seat led to a minus despite the rule of 15. I am not saying that always happens and you should not base your bidding on results per se. However, my experience tells me not to open balanced 11 counts.|
