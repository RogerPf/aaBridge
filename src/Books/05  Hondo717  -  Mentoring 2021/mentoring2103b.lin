nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, one could claim with a self sufficient suit, East could assume spades is trump and make some dummy add ons. In that event, East can add 2 points for singleton for sure for 16 points. Regardless, 2@S is 100% correct.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West should be very interested in slam once East rebids 2@S. A 4@S bid by West is incorrect. That is Fast Arrival. Since a game force is established, a jump to 4@S shows a weak hand with little slam interest. |
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West's correct bid is 3@S. Whereas with slam interest you want to conserve bidding room. 3@S is at least a mild slam try establishing spades as trump.|

mb|3S|mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East certainly has slam interest, so 4@C is a control bid, showing 1st or 2nd round control in clubs.|

If West passes, then North knows that East has a lot of points and wants to preempt. But once West opens 1@C, it is not clear who has the points. The only time I would open 2@H with the North hand is 3rd seat. Otherwise I wouldn't.|
