mb|D|mb|3H|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another nice bid by West. With only 12 HCP it is a very powerful hand. In fact, 4@H would not be out of the question but 3@H is fine.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|4H|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@H is a reasonable bid for East. But another possibility would be 3NT. Since the East hand is not getting any extra tricks by ruffing, the 9 trick contract might be easier to make than a 10 trick contract, assuming that the timing of the hand allows declarer to take 9 tricks before the defense takes 5 tricks. |
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it turns out, declarer will probably make 3N, taking 7 hearts and a club for sure and a trick in either diamonds or spades.|

pc|DT|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is why it is important to lead count in partner's unsupported suit. I now know that we are beating this hand because if partner has a doubleton diamond which is what the 10 indicates. That means I know declarer started with 3 (dummy and I have 7, partner has 2, leaving 3 for West). |
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This sort of counting is crucial if you want to defend well. So we are getting 2 diamonds, a diamond ruff, and the @SA. Further, I will make it very easy on partner to defend. Whenever you can prevent partner from making a mistake on defense you should do so. This defense guarantees down 1. |
