nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Originally Bergen recommended 3@C = 7-9 and 3@D = 10-12 with 4-card support. Others, including me, play 3@C = 10-12 and 3@D = 7-9. That is called Reverse Bergen.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |

If our side "constructively" bids to game, then if the other side bids over our game bid, we have to double or bid over their bid. Therefore, if 4@H were bid voluntarily (for example, 1@H-P-2@H-2@S-4@H ) that would be a constructive bid to game since North could have competed to 3@H and chose to bid 4@H.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In that case if they bid 4@S, we must double or bid 5@H because otherwise the opponents will be able to steal from us. So in that case, if North passes over 4@S after 4@H, that is called a "forcing pass."|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It means North is not sure whether to double or bid 5@H and is leaving it up to me. However, in this auction, it is not clear that 4@H was constructive. 4@H might just be competing over 3@S and could mean that normally North would have just bid 3@H over my 3@D bid has West passed.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the pass here is not forcing. Having said that, because North has such a nice hand, North must double. It is possible they are making 4@S, but unlikely. North could easily be taking 4 tricks (1 heart, 2 clubs, 1 diamond).|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So because North was intending to bid game over 3@D she should either double or bid 5@H. With 3 spades, I would choose double.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now that she passed, I have to decide what to do. In general I try not to bid to the 5 level. But on this hand, since I have no defense and a singleton spade I will bid 5@H.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It worked out okay for us. BTW, the 4@S bid was a very nice bid. It usually pays to bid 4@S over 4@H. On the defense, West chose what is called "passive" defense. The 2nd spade was a neutral play, as it did not give anything away.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, on this hand West might choose an "active" defense. It is quite possible their side has 2 diamond tricks off the top. For example suppose partner had the @DK instead of the @DQ.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Then by leading diamonds they can beat the hand, even if North has the @CA and @CK. So the @DA was the best play at trick 2. Passive defense is often the correct way to play, especially at Match Points, as it gives nothing away.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, there are hands where, when declarer might be able to run a long suit and discard losers, that the defenders must play aggressively.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Finally, it is almost never right to bid "5 over 5" e.g. if, for example West had bid 5@C or 5@D over 4@H. Then 5@H would almost never be right, even if we were vul and they were not.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|"5 over 4" particularly 5@H over 4@S, is not as clear cut. But as a general rule, too many people bid 5@H when they should double, So when in doubt, double rather than bid.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One other comment on the opening heart lead. I got a question about a lead convention called "MUD" which stands for "middle up down." With that lead convention, you lead your middle card from 3 small and then play your higher remaining card.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So in this board, West would lead the @H8 and then follow with the @H10 (to have partner not think he has a doubleton). I think that is a terrible convention as it is very hard for partner to work out you are leading middle.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You should take a stand regarding leading from 3 small. Either play count (my choice) or top of nothing (attitude) which is okay also. MUD is worth "mud" as far as I am concerned.|

mb|3S|mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I consider my hand to have some good news and bad news. The bad news is my 4-3-3-3 distribution meaning I can't generate any tricks with ruffs. I hate the downgradable 4-3-3-3 hands. On the other hand, I have lots of good news. The most important is I have lots of controls (aces and kings) which is very good for slam.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another way to say this is I have 3 |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=quicktricks,Quick Tricks^*N|CP||FP||at|. They are 2 in clubs, 1/2 in spades, and 1/2 in hearts.|

PG| ***** 57 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One way I evaluate whether or not to upgrade my hand is to count what I call Quick Trick Points. There are 8 possible Quick Tricks (2 in each suit) and there are 40 HCP. So each Quick Trick is equivalent to around 5 HCP (40 / 8). By that method, I have 15 Quick Trick points.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If your Quick Trick points exceed your actual HCP, you should like your hand and upgrade it because that means you have lots of controls for your number of HCP. So since my 13 HCP are equal to 15 Quick Trick points, I upgrade my hand as having excess controls. My quality club suit is an added bonus.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore,, despite my downgradable 4-3-3-3, I do like my hand for slam. If I had a really weak opener with minimal controls, I would not accept the slam try and just bid 4@H. But here I will control bid my cheapest control which is 4@C.|

mb|1C?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North has a clear 1@H overcall. Pass is not an option. You should overcall at 1 level even with as few as 8 points if you have a good suit. As soon, you will see, this gives East a problem. Competing often does make it awkward for the opponents.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West did well to go down 1. Please, notice the whole bidding problem experienced by EW was a result of the 1@H overcall. So the moral of the story is to compete aggressively. Sometimes even simple non jump overcalls can cause problems.|

mb|P|mb|1S?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My hand is an example of how you change evaluation depending on the auction sometimes. If East had opened 1@D, I would bid 3@C preemptive. But over 1@S my hand is not as good. Length in the opponents' suit is a downgrade on offense.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 3@H, depending on the defense, and because of the lucky heart and club positions we end up taking 5 hearts and 6 clubs and a spade making 6. That is another argument for not bidding 4@D because it might make us bid 4@H which we make.|

mb|3H|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@H is what most players would bid and is fine. However, with very nice hearts and diamond void, I might open 4@H with the East hand although the unfavorable vul is discouraging.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This was not a good result for NS, although the bidding okay. North should save a trick by playing 2 rounds of diamonds, ending up in dummy: and avoid the admittedly very unlucky club ruff. But still takes 9 tricks at most.|
