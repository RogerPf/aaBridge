mb|P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I agree with North's pass. However, I will sometimes preempt 3@C with a 6-card club suit. You obviously can't open a weak 2@C. So, in 1st or 2nd seat, I will open 3@C with a 6-card suit if I have a singleton or void, especially if I am short in the majors and in 3rd seat, I will pretty much open 3@C with a 6-card suit regardless because 3rd seat is the most effective seat in which to preempt.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I also might open 3@C without a singleton or void in 1st or 2nd seat at favorable vulnerability (we are not vul, they are vul).|

mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's discuss responses when partner makes a forcing raise of 2NT over 1@H or 1@S. Your first obligation is to show shortness (singleton or void). So on this hand East should bid 3@C.|

PG| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With no shortness then East would use "fast arrival" to describe hand strength meaning the higher they bid, the less they have, the idea being the stronger you are the slower you want to go in exploring for slam.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With a weak opener (12-14) they would bid 4@S. With a medium opener (15-17) they would bid 3NT (which is not a suggestionto play 3NT, just strength showing) and with a strong opener (18+) you bid 3@S.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another alternative for opener over 2NT, which rarely occurs is opener can jump to 4 of a suit if they have a 5-card suit with 2 of the top 3 honors. This situation almost never occurs.|

up|36|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@S was correct as West has little slam interest. Again an example of fast arrival. Now this is a good time to discuss "active" vs. "passive" defense. More often than not you play passive defense meaning you try not to give away tricks.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand I can see I need to play active defense, taking as many tricks as possible because the @HJ9 are set up for discards. So I have to hope we have some tricks in diamonds and/or clubs. Unfortunately I have no way of knowing which suit to lead. So at trick five I lead a diamond.|

mb|P|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't hate pass by North. but an invite would not be terrible although aggressive. In Match Points pass is probably best but in IMPs, especially if vul, you want to stretch to bid games. So 2N is not out of the question although very aggressive.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people play 4 way transfers where 2@S over 1N is a club transfer and 2N over 1N is a diamond transfer. If you play that, the way you invite is to bid 2@C (presumably Stayman) and then bid 2N over whatever opener responds to Stayman.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you play that, then you must alert the 2N bid as not guaranteeing a 4-card major.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, what happens if I open 1@S, feeling my hand is too strong for 1N.  In that case North responds 2@S and I need to bid game. Probably 3N is my best bid, but 4@S is fine as well. However, both 4@S and 3N are iffy contracts.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 4@S, I could easily lose 2 spades and 2 clubs. And in 3N, unless I manage to lose only 1 spade, I cannot make 3N.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So my hand certainly qualifies and even if you normally open a weak 2 with a 6-card suit, given my very nice heart suit, and the favorable vulnerability, I think a 2@H bid is very reasonable.

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Tough hand to play.  The diamond split was very unlucky.  Not sure why North ducked the @DA at trick six, but on this hand it probably only cost one trick.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@C is a difficult contract to play and it is not clear how to play it. But here is how I would play the hand. After winning the @HA at trick 2, I would lead the @SJ. Say East wins the @SA and returns a spade (which is reasonable). |
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Declarer should win the spade and ruff a spade in dummy. Declarer can now lead a diamond to the ace and exit with a low club. |
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West should win the club, cash the @DQ and play a heart. The defense will probably end up taking 1 diamond, 1 spade, and 3 clubs, and declarer will make the hand.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, East was thinking about bidding again because of the strong hand. I am certainly in favor of aggressive bidding but you must exercise some prudence.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case, East for a few reasons should be very worried about bidding again. First, they are vul and we are not. Second, I bid 1NT meaning I have some heart values and partner did not raise.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Third, East has club cards which are great on defense, but probably do not fit well with partner on offense. You prefer having honors in combination with partner rather than in an opponent's suit when declaring.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So in this case East is best passing because bidding is likely to get EW into trouble and has little upside.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now this is a very interesting distribution in spades. Most players would get this wrong. Note that if West leads a low spade and North plays low, E/W can only take 2 spade tricks. Let me show you with tricks nine and ten.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The ^*B"surround play"^*N is an expert play that does happen on rare occasions. It occurs when dummy holds the 10 and you are behind dummy with the honor and the 9. I am not suggesting you necessarily learn it as it is rare and you should focus on the more common techniques of defensive card play.|

mb|P|mb|P|mb|1D|MB|3h|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@H is the wrong bid for several reasons
a) it shows a preemptive hand, not a strong hand and North has a strong hand
b) it shows 7 hearts usually and north has 8 hearts.|

up|25|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With the West hand I would be tempted to double 4@H. That is neither pure penalty nor pure takeout. It just shows extra values. It says "partner do something intelligent" and partner would often pass with a flat hand with some defense. |
PG| ***** 140 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But on this hand, partner would bid 4@S which is not a wonderful spot, but is not horrible. In 4@S they lose 2 clubs, 1 diamond, and 1 or probably 2 spades for down 2 which given the vulnerability if doubled is slightly worse than our side making 4@H (-500 vs. -450).|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In IMPs, assuming North doubles that is not a big deal. However, some Norths or some Souths might bid 5@H over 4@S given the vulnerability and the fact that, if partner has a preempt, we are not beating 4@S.|
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since 5@H makes, it ends up being a wash. But if 5@H went down, the double would have worked out well if they got to 5@H. The main point being, as usual, aggressive bidding often pays off, and usually makes the opponents guess.|
