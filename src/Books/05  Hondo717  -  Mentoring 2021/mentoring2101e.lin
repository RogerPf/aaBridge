mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me review how East responds to Jacoby 2NT. East's first obligation is to show a singleton or void. Bidding 3@C, 3@D, or 3@H shows shortness in that suit. Failing that, East shows the strength of their opener using the principle of "fast arrival" meaning the higher they bid, the weaker their hand.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East has 3 ways to show how strong they are. 3@S is the strongest bid, showing 18+ (and strong slam interest). 3N shows a medium opener (15-17). It is not really a suggestion to play 3N, just the conventional way to show a better than min opener and 4@S shows a min opener.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Rarely East (OPENER) will bid 4@C, 4@D, or 4@H which shows a 2nd 5 card suit with 2 of the top 3 honors. But if you forget about those bids it is fine as they rarely come up. 4@S is the correct bid here.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That was a pretty straight forward hand, with at most 2 losers. If the heart finesse loses, then East can discard a club on the 3rd heart, and will either lose 1 club and 1 heart, or 2 clubs.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When there is the suit combination Kxx opposite Qxx, which is how the clubs are distributed here, almost all of the time, that is going to result in 2 losers, as it did here.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, if it so happens that one player has Ax, as was the case here and declarer happens to guess who has Ax, then there is only one loser. Here there was no reason for declarer to guess I have Ax of clubs, except for the fact that because North has a spade void, they are less likely to have a doubleton club because that would mean they are 6-5 in the minors and didn't bid.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So an expert declarer might decide to play me for Ax of clubs and at trick 8 lead low to the dummy's @CQ. If I take my @CA (which is the wrong play) then East has only 1 club loser.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Declarer now plays a low club from dummy and plays his low club, not the @CK. So on this hand, I have to take the @CA and East's club K is now good. That rarely occurs, but is something to keep in mind if that is your only shot to make a contract.|

mb|1D|mb|P|mb|1H|mb|3S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a reasonable bid. I prefer, however, to have a singleton or void with a vul preempt. But with the nice suit, even at this vul, I like 3@S rather than 2@S. Aggressive preempting usually pays off.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Note that North has an inference I started with 3 hearts because with a doubleton in hearts I might very well lead the @HA since partner bid the suit.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I led the lowest visible club. So I have either 3 or 4 clubs meaning East has at least one more. And the @CA should be cashing. Further, I don't have the @CJ10 because I would have led the @CJ to start with. After that North can lead a diamond.|

up|32|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So notice all the inferences good defenders can make based on the carding and auction. Good defense is very hard, and you must train yourself to use all the available clues including "negative" inferences. |
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case, because I didn't lead the @HA, the negative inference is I don't have a doubleton heart. So double would have worked well here. But even -200 is probably a reasonably good board since we can't make game.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|At best we make 3@H and that might even go down. Double would be very speculative on my part which is why you should preempt. Even when it might not work out, it is hard for the opponents to double you into game.|

UP|28|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very lucky I made the hand. As East, it does look hopeless to beat the hand but there are 2 possibilities. One is that partner started with doubleton @HQ and couldn't play it under the @HK and will get a ruff.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other is that partner has a spade trick, although that seems unlikely based on the auction. So East, at trick three, should probably cash the @HA before exiting with a spade. |

mb|P|mb|1D|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West has 3 flawed choices of responses to 1@D. One is to pass, because of the possible misfit. Another is to bid 1@S because of the superior spade suit. In general, with 5-5 in the majors you usually bid 1@S. But in this case, 1@H is also a reasonable choice. |
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West is likely passing whatever East rebids. So by bidding 1@H, West gives East the chance to bid 1@S with 4 spades or bid 2@H with 4 (or sometimes even 3) hearts. So 1@H was definitely a reasonable choice.|

mb|1H|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P|mb|3D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let me discuss a little known bid that East can make and that is 3NT.

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is another suit combination--@SJxx opposite @SA10xxx to talk about. You will often lose 2 spades. But there are 2 chances you lose 1 spade. One is if South has the @SKQ and the other (as in this hand) is if South started with @SKx or @SQx. |
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So a slightly better way to play the hand after drawing trump and knocking out the @HA is not to play all the diamonds out rather lead a low spade to the @S10 and, while still retaining diamond entries to the hand play a 2nd spade and hope an honor falls, which it does. |

mb|1S|mb|P|mb|2S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I personally think 2@S is a bit of an underbid. Using Bergen Hand Evaluation West has 9 HCP, 1 length point, and 1 point for the doubleton. So is worth a 3 card limit raise. In fact, I wouldn't hate a 2@H bid, although that is a slight overbid since it is a game force and West is not quite strong enough to game force.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I swapped the @DK and made it the @HK, such that East held @SQxx @HAK10xx, @Dxxx, @Cxx, I would in fact bid 2@H. But with West's actual hand, I think 1N, followed by a jump to 3H, is actually best. As it turns out it doesn't matter since East has a 4@S call.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Declarer should make 5. The way declarer played it, guaranteed to only make 4. whereas if the @CA was onside, as it was, he can make 5. Therefore, at trick eleven after cashing the @H10, declarer might as well lead a low club.
