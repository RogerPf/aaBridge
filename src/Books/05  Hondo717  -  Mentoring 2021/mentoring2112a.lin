nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Despite what some thing, getting into the auction ASAP, particularly with distributional hands, is much better than waiting to describe your hand later. If you wait, by the time the auction gets back to you, the auction will be at a higher level such that you won't be able to describe your hand anyway. And you have made it so much easier on your opponents by waiting.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That didn't work out well for East, but that happens occasionally when you preempt aggressively and many players would bid with my hand then it would have worked out fine. The upside of aggressive preempting is much higher than the downside. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, had East taken the @CK he would have been down 1 less. Although 2@H is aggressive, these days many experts open weak a weak 2 with a 5 card suit when they have unbalanced distribution. |
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So 2@H was a reasonable choice. Some only do it in 1st and 3rd seat but some do it in 2nd seat as well.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, absent the spade lead 3N is fine. It is often the case that even with an 8 card major suit fit 3N is just as good and sometimes better than 4 of a major.|

up|40|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although it is not going to matter, North should have played the @S8 on my S@K to show the @SJ. Also with the clubs on the table North needs to save clubs. That is the safest play. Although in Match Points, given the @CJ lead, I would have risked ducking in both hands. This is risky, in that if North then switches to a spade, 3NT might go down. But if North does not find the spade switch, you will end up running the clubs and making a lot of overtricks.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But if you are trying to make you contract, the @CA is 100% correct. Please note on this hand 4@H is better than 3N but more often than not, opening 1N with a 5-card major will get you to the right spot even with an 8-card fit.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BWest: ^*NIs it possible to use 3@C as |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=puppetstayman,Puppet Stayman^*N|CP||FP||at|?|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a good point. Some people do play that if you bid 3@C over 1NT as "Puppet Stayman", it allows opener, West here, to show their 5-card heart suit as well as 4-card majors.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, if playing Puppet Stayman, East could bid 3@C and West would respond 3@H which shows a 5-card heart suit. Then they would get to 4@H.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if it bothers you to open 1NT with a 5-card major you can learn and play 3@C as Puppet Stayman and therefore, guarantee that you will not miss an 8-card major suit fit (when responder has a game forcing hand) which makes it even more valuable to open 1N with a 5-card major.|

mb|2D?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had West passed 2@H would be a reverse by North over 1@S showing 16+ and North is not strong enough. However, 2@H over 2@D by West is fine as it no longer shows as much strength.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason 2@H is no longer a reverse is because opener no longer has 2@C available as a rebid to show a hand too weak to reverse. So rather than possibly losing the heart suit, opener is allowed to bid 2@H even with a weaker hand. Note that the 2@H bid still shows 5 clubs and 4 hearts.|

mb|2H?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East has a clear diamond raise. The only question is how many diamonds to bid.

It is okay but I am not in love with it. I like having both major suits. However, I wish I had my high cards in my long suits rather than having most of my high cards in my short suits. It is much more desirable to have your high cards in your long suits.|

mb|1H|mb|D?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I recommend you play |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=bergenraises,Bergen Raises^*N|CP||FP||AT| over a takeout double. North has a 7-9/4-card raise and therefore should bid a 3@D Bergen Raise.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So North bid 3@D to show 7-9 with 4 hearts.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*NIs it standard that Bergen is on with interference?|

cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No it is not standard. But I think it is a good way to play it. Many only play it over takeout doubles but I also play it after a 1@S and 2@C overcall.|

sk|s|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Given the takeout double, I know West is short in hearts. With no information, one way to play the heart suit is to play the @HA and a low heart which works whenever hearts are 2-2 or someone has a singleton honor. |
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But given the auction the better way to play it is to take 2 heart finesses against East who will often have the @HKQ on this auction.|
