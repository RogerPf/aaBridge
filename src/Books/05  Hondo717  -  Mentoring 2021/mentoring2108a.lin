mb|P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Pass is okay with the North hand but only because of the 5 card spade suit. Otherwise, even with a 4 card spade suit and weak diamonds I think 2@D is a better bid.|

Whether or not North takes the @CA West will get one or two club tricks and makes the hand, perhaps even making 5 if North takes the @CA. Again, planning the hand is important.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So when you play negative doubles, if you are short in an opponents suit in the balancing position after 2 passes you have to protect against partner having a penalty double and not being able to make it and strain to double even with imperfect hands. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Fortunately, on this hand, East has about as perfect a double as there is.|

pc|CJ|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you can see, EW can make 4 hearts. That's why you preempt. You cause the opponents to guess what to do and they often guess wrong. I probably pass with the East hand as well since partner didn't bid 3@H over 3@C and would do so with any 8+ raise. |
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out hearts break on this hand. But after a preempt, with an 8 card fit a 4-1 break is very likely, probably around 45% which is another reason not to stretch to bid game. |
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With the same hand and a 6th heart I might bid 4@H with the East hand. But with a likely 8-card or even 7-card fit, 4@H is much harder to bid.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If North had won the first heart, they could return a heart. A diamond back is probably best since I am unlikely to have the @SA particularly given I had 10 points in clubs.|

up|41|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East did not plan the entries well. East should win the diamond in her hand, draw the last trump, and leave the @DQ on the board as an entry to take the spade finesse. Further, this hand is a good illustration of preempts working.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, defense is very hard and players often don't defend optimally which is why it pays to bid aggressively. Even if you are in a non-optimal contract, you often make it even when you should not.|
