up|40|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A very lucky hand for me. I needed 2-2 break (40%) and @DA on side (50%) so about 20% that it would make. Also, it turns out they make 3@C. But obviously can't bid it over 3@S.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Anyway, you should take the opportunity to preempt whenever you have a suitable hand with the appropriate length. Preempts work out well more often than not.|

cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes in every seat. However, there are some differences. In 2nd seat, if you open a preempt it should be more standard rather than stretching because you are more likely to preempt your partner since one opponent has already passed. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 3rd seat, after 2 passes, you should be very aggressive. The weaker you are the more aggressive you need to be because 4th seat is likely to be strong. In 1st seat you should also be aggressive as striking the first blow when you can is likely to get you a good result.|

mb|1D|mb|3S|mb|P|mb|4S|mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let me discuss the bidding. Although West only has 8 HCP, she has a great hand given the auction. The spade void is huge and 5-5 is wonderful distribution. She even has some diamonds and not vul against vul is nice as well. So West should make a double at 3@S or higher. |

up|36|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I didn't discuss my planning because I wanted to illustrate that sometimes you can make a hand by hoping a mis-defense. On this hand I can count 9 sure tricks--6 spades and 3 aces. |
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My only hope for a 10th trick is in clubs and I have to hope that I can set up a 2nd club before they lead hearts. Otherwise, I will lose 1 heart, 2 clubs, and 1 spade and go down 1. So that's how I played it.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, it was hard for West to know when they got in with the 2nd club that they needed to lead a heart and that's what I was hoping for.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, the moral of the hand is plan, and if there is no legitimate way to make the hand, come up with a plan that at least gives you a chance if there is a mis-defense.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's talk about what happens if West doubles. North will still bid 4@S and it is not clear what E/W should do in that case. I probably pass with East's hand, although 5@D is not unreasonable.|

In Match Points I might pass hoping we can't make game and we can beat 1@D at least 1 @- +200. In Match Points when your side can't make game it is a top board. But in IMPs I can't afford the risk. So I will bid 2N, to show a hand with diamonds, just short of an opener and no majors.|

pc|SQ|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a good lead. West did not lead a diamond. That is a "negative inference", that I can make because of something West did not do. So West almost certainly does not have 5 diamonds. It is likely West has 4 but on a good day might only have 3. |
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I can count 4 diamonds, 2 clubs, and 2 spades for 8 tricks.

PG| ***** 64 ***** |


mb|3D|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is NOT strong. 3@D is weak, showing 4+ diamonds and not a limit raise. If West wanted to show a limit raise (or stronger) they would cue bid 2@C, the opponent's suit. |
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is an important bidding principle in competitive auctions. Make your jump raises weak so you preempt the opponents. Use a cue bid to show a strong raise.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*NI would bid 1@H with West hand. East could easily have a 4 card major. Or give East a good 4 card spade suit and game can be made.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well, I think you would be wrong, particularly with such lousy hearts. If West had a strong raise, they would have bid 2@C.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


mb|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's discuss what North should do over 3@D. North with 7-4 distribution does not want to defend. 4@C is possible and probably the best bid. Another possibility would be 3@H (although since I am weak, it is not clear that hearts will play better than clubs). |
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


mb|4C|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@H would show long clubs and only 4 hearts because with 5 hearts (unless 5-6, very unlikely) North should have opened 1@H. So keep that in mind. When you open 1 of a minor and later rebid a major, you almost always have exactly 4 in that major.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


MB|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I see no reason for East to bid 4@D although it turns out it works out here. East could easily be losing 2 clubs or even 3 on a bad day and might only lose 1 trick in the majors, but given West is weak, could easily lose 2. So I would defend 4 clubs and hope to beat it. However as it turns out, 4@D is the winning call.|

PG| ***** 85 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So declarer should win the diamond return in the dummmy and ruff a club. Then lead a diamond and ruff another club.

PG| ***** 88 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 1st seat, I will do it if I have an unbalanced hand (a singleton or void) but not if 6-3-2-2. In 2nd seat, I tend to avoid it, because I might be preempting partner and partner is entitled to think I have 7 clubs. |
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, if I am short in the majors (for example I have 2-1 in the majors and 6 clubs and 4 diamonds) I might do it, particularly if not vul. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 3rd seat I do it regardless of distribution. As I said before, in 3rd seat in general, you want to aggressively preempt. So 3@C by North is reasonable. But I would be a little concerned that we might miss 4@S. |
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But in general, when you have a 6-card suit and a weakish hand you want to play in your long suit, so I would still open 3@C.

Argument in favor of 3@H is the vulnerability (West not vul, NS vul). But the 4 card club suit is a red flag because East is known to be short in clubs, and yet did not compete over 3@C. So East can't have that good a hand and West's hand is not that good either.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So although it is far from clear, I might pass instead of 3@H. Meanwhile, I don't want to discourage you from bidding aggressively, so 3@H is certainly reasonable.|

up|44|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 5-0 heart break was a problem for declarer in setting up diamonds. And please notice how I planned the defense. |
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I counted out West's hand. I know West started out with 5 hearts, 2 spades and 2 diamonds which meant West had 4 clubs. So, at trick 9, when I lead the @SK I knew West had a club and 3 hearts left and therefore could not make the hand.

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 3@C we take 6 clubs, 3 spades, and 1 diamond and making 4. So 3@H down 1 was a reasonable result. Once again showing that aggressive bidding is right much more often than not.|

mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I have a lot of choices here. The hand technically meets the  |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=ruleof20,Rule of 20^*N|CP||FP||at| with 9 HCP and 11 major suit cards. So I theoretically could open 1@H. And the hand is a very powerful hand on offense. |
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The fact that I have spades is not relevant on offense, because I want to play in hearts even if partner has 4 spades. Admittedly if partner has 5 or 6 spades and only 1 heart, I might prefer spades. |
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But even then, hearts is reasonable. My other choice is to open 3@H. But I really like opening 4@H as that is likely to be our best spot and making it hard for the opponents to bid.|

mb|4H|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Double is not pure penalty. It is "value showing" and asks partner to "do something intelligent".|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|5D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Pass by East is certainly an option so is 5@D. It's hard to know. Partner is not showing diamonds, and with a weak 5 card suit it could be very wrong. But that's why you preempt. You make it uncomfortable for the opponents.|
