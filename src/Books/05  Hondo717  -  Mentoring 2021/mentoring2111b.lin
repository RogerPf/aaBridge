The criteria for opening 2@C is your hand has to be able to take 9 tricks and has 4 quick tricks. |
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The hand has 4.5 quick tricks (2 in spades, 1.5 in diamonds, 1 in hearts). It obviously can take 5 spades and the 2 aces for 7 tricks. It is not clear how many diamonds East can take.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With a 5 card suit, the other 3 hands contain 8 diamonds. So on average West will hold 2-3 diamonds. Therefore, with an 8 card fit and reasonably likely 3-2 break, East could take 3 diamond tricks. But with a 7-card fit it is not as clear. |
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So East hand probably can take slightly less than 9 tricks on average. Further, with a marginal 2@C opener and a 2 suiter, it is often better to open at the 1 level. So I think it is a tossup between 1@S and 2@C.|

up|41|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out pass by West was best. I might have bid 4N with West's hand. That is definitely takeout. Over 4@S most experts play it as any 2 suits. Others play it as showing both minors.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here I think they make 5 of a minor although it requires careful play with both minors breaking 4-1. So the result for N/S should be okay.|

mb|P|mb|P|mb|1H|mb|3D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think a preempt is best. North doesn't have a major. So he should consider making it hard for E/W to find their fit. Personally, I think 4@D with an 8 card suit is better than 3@D, particularly at this vul where NS is not vul and EW is vul.|

mb|D|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That bid is okay. That is still a |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=negativedoubles,Negative Double^*N|CP||FP||at|. However, I prefer 3NT. It is risky, though very rewarding when it works. It is certainly possible that West has 4 spades or without 4 spades West might rebid 3@H and then East can bid 3N. But I like 3N right away slightly better, although double is reasonable as well.|

up|37|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out they are also down 1 in 5@C losing 1 club and 2 spades. In 4@D doubled (I would double 4@D with the East hand) we lose 2 hearts and 2 diamonds for down 1.|
