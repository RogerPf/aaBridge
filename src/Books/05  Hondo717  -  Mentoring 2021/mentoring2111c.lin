mb|P|mb|P|mb|1H|mb|1S?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North certainly could pass. Personally I would bid 2@D although admittedly one could argue North is slightly weak for that bid. However, with such a nice suit I would strain to bid it. 2@D is not forcing given North is a passed hand. It tends to show around 10-11 points.|

But there is a case to be made for 2@S with the flat hand and extra strength. In fact, there is a convention that you can play to show a 7-9 hand with 4-card support which is what East has. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Note that if East cue bid 2@H, that would be a limit raise 10+. Some experts play a jump cue (e.g 3@H) shows a constructive raise (7-9 with 4-card support). If you played that, then East could bid 3@H. Not playing that, I think both 2@S and 3@S are possible.|

mb|2S?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I hate to pass. I have a great 6-4 hand with all my points in my 2 longest suits which is always an upgrade. Partner did not bid 2@H so I know he likely doesn't have 3 hearts. He might have clubs. |
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I could bid 3@C. On the other hand, with nice hearts I could conceivably play opposite a singelton although I wouldn't like it. Therefore, I will bid 3@H, which is a bit of a risk.|

I play 4 way transfers which means 2@S is a transfer to clubs and 2N is a transfer to diamonds. And the way I play responses to the minor suit transfers is non-standard. |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I play over 2N, if the 1N bidder bids 3@D that means he "likes" diamonds because he has one of the top 3 honors. If he bids 3@C he denies one of the top 3 diamond honors. So on this hand if I have the DK North definitely wants to be in 3N.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I suggest you switch to using 4@S as RKCB when hearts are trump because it allows you to do the queen ask when the response is the 2nd step. I also prefer 0314 to 1430 although that is not especially important. I just think it is more logical.|
