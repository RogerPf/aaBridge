up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North needed to plan the hand a little better. At worst North can see he will lose 2 spades and 1 club. The question is what is the best way to play the spade suit. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Personally, I would play West for at least one honor and lead the @S9 and duck. If that loses to the @SJ I would return to dummy and play a low spade and play the @SQ if West plays low. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it turns out, still makes 5 that way. However, North needs to plan the entries better. North should play a low heart to the ace at trick 2 and a low heart to the K at trick 3. Then play the @S9. When that loses, still has an entry with the @HJ to take the spade finesse again. |
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Handling entries is a difficult declarer technique on some hands which is why you need to plan the entire hand before you play.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't like the Rule of 15 in any case. I prefer that you open if your hand meets the rule of 20 in all seats and don't open if it does not.|

mb|P|mb|P|mb|2C|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss how I like to respond to 2@C opener. Some players bid 2@D as a "^*Bpositive^*n" response (meaning they have 5+ HCP or at least one ace or king) and 2@H shows a bust (0-4 with no aces or kings).|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't particularly like that. I play that you almost always bid 2@D with one exception. If you have a 5+ card major with 2 of the top 3 then you can bid it. So I would bid 2@H with the West hand instead of 2@D.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Note that if you play 2@H shows a weak hand and if East happens to have hearts you end up wrong siding the contract. Having said that, if you want to play 2@H as a bust, it works out okay most of the time. Here we will play my way, and West will bid 2@H.|

mb|2H|mb|P|mb|2S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West should bid 3@S which is stronger than 4@S. When you are in a game forcing auction the principle of 
"^*Bfast arrival^*n" applies meaning a jump to game shows a weaker hand and 3@S shows a stronger hand.|

mb|3S|mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now East knows a lot about West's hand--West has the KQ of hearts and at least 3 spades so with all the controls he can just bid 4N. I prefer 3014.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, it would not be terrible to be in six--around 50%-- because with a 9 card fit missing just the queen and not the jack the odds that the queen comes down in one or two rounds is around 50%.

mb|P|mb|P|mb|1N|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|These days you always open 1NT with 5-3-3-2 and 15-17 even with a 5-card major. So West should open 1NT.|

mb|p|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North needs to decide what to do. Pass is definitely not correct. If you play DONT (and you definitely should play DONT over 1NT) when you have a long spade suit, you have several choices.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you bid 2@S right away, that shows a relatively weak hand with 6+ spades. If you double (showing a 1 suited hand) and then bid 2@S that shows a stronger hand. And if you double and bid at the 3 level (that applies to all suits) you show a really strong hand with a really nice suit. Another option is to bid at the 3 level right away which is preemptive.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now what should North do given all of those options?|
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


AT| Definitely not just 2@S though doubling and bidding 2@S or 3@S is okay. And given I passed, just bidding 3@S right away is fine also.|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|At this vulnerability, I would bid 3@S because although North has a nice hand, the likelihood we have game once I pass is pretty small, particuarly after the 1N opener. So the best option is to get in the opponents way. Now let us give North an undo.|

up|36|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Please note that the @HQ lead made it easy for North to play the hand to decide whether to take the heart finesse or spade finesse. In general, you should avoid leading a doubleton honor unless partner has bid the suit, or you have no better alternative.|
