WHen playing |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dont,DONT^*N|CP||FP||at| that promises either 5-4 or 5-5.

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Playing DONT, if you double 1NT, that shows a single suited hand with a 6-card suit. A suit bid shows a 2 suited hand, which is why 2@D is the correct DONT bid.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


mb|2D|mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally, with 3-card support, pass is fine. Without 3-card support, North bids the next higher suit (hearts on this auction). This allows West to pass if the 2nd suit is hearts or correct to 2@S if spades is their 2nd suit.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So as I said, technically pass is okay with the East hand. However, in this case, East also has support for whichever major West has. Therefore, if East bids 2@H, it would be fine with East if West passed with hearts or bid 2@S with spades. |
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In addition, if West's suit happened to be hearts, then East will be delighted to have 4-card support. So although east could pass 2@D, I think 2@H is a better call with this particular East hand.|

I would rather compete particularly since North's suits are the unbid suits, spades and clubs. North could double here, which would be takeout for spades and clubs.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But with such nice clubs, despite the fact that we would be at the 3-level and not so nice spades I think 3@C is the best bid.|

mb|3C|mb|Ppp|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Unfortunately, the auction tells neither East nor West that they have a 9-card heart fit. with that information, LOTT says they should bid 3@H.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In fact, many 2/1 players if they have a game force, 4 spades, and a 4 card minor over 1@H, bid 2 of their minor to establish the game force. And partner is supposed to bid 2@S (as North did) with 4 spades.|

mb|P4h|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 4@H bid by North, is another example of "Fast Arrival." If North had slam interest, would control bid. So by bypassing all control bidding, North is saying they have no interest in slam unless I am very strong (20+).|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Given the 9-card fit, I would bid 4@S with the West hand. But since it is possible that West could in theory have as few as 8 points, 3@S is a reasonable alternative.|

pc|HJ|pc|HA|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's do some planning for East. It is almost certain South has the @SK. If spades are 3-1 and the spade finesse works, declarer can count 5 spade tricks, 3 heart tricks, and 1 club ruff for 9 tricks. The 10th trick can be either the 4th heart or perhaps declarer can set up a diamond.|

sk||cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 4-0 spade break is fatal. If declarer draws all the trump in 4 rounds, he will end up losing 2 diamonds and another club (since West will be out of trump and unable to ruff the @C10).|
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So declarer should plan on setting up a diamond trick,  and losing the @SK. That should result in down 1.|
