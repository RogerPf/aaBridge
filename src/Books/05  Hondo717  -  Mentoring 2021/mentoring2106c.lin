UP|46|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The hand took a little planning. The idea is to count your winners. Declarer had 2 spade winners, 2 club winners, and 4 heart winners. That's 8 tricks. 2 more tricks were needed. |
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The easiest way to get 2 more was to ruff a club and knock out the @DA and @DK to set up a diamond which is what declarer did. The idea is not to draw trump until you ruff a club. |
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It would have been fine to play the @HA and @HK first and then play a club to the king and ruff a club. But after that you "lose your losers early." So rather than playing any spades first, you then play diamonds to lose diamonds while you still have spades controlled.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In terms of counting winners vs losers, a lot of teachers recomend you count your losers in a trump contract. But it is not always obvious how to count losers and frankly it is easier and better to count winners because your objective is to win tricks. |
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, on this hand, you have one club loser if you draw trump. But if you don't draw trump, you have no club losers. So it is true when you have losers you figure out a way to eliminate them. But counting winners essentially does the same thing and I think is easier to do.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@H was a reasonable bid. It didn't work out on this hand. A preempt always involves some risk. Most of the time, it works out well for the pre-empter.

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, some people would panic with my hand and bid 3@S. That is not a good idea because it is likely West has spades given the double. So I am just trading one bad result for another.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Partner's hand is not worth much unless you play in hearts and my @HJ has some value. And other than spades I have no other source of tricks. So I should just pass and hope for the best.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Actually both sides did pretty well. But I have several small nits. If East chooses to lead a diamond, East should lead the @D9 not the @D8. You lead high low from a doubleton. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But another way to play clubs is to lead a low club to the @CK right away. If that loses and North can get to the board then can lead another club and play the @C9 hoping West has the @C10. Again those are small nits. Basically everyone did very well on the hand.|

mb|1C|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I agree with opening 1@C. However, some players open 1@D with 4 diamonds and 5 clubs, intending to rebid 2@C over 1 of a major. I think that is an awful way to play because then partner never knows when you open 1@D and rebid 2@C, if you have 5 diamonds and 4 clubs, or 4 diamonds and 5 clubs.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The idea is a rebid of 2@C over 1@C is supposed to show 6. On this hand, I would rebid 1N over either a 1@H or 1@S response.|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Anyway, bottom line is I think opening 1@D with 4 diamonds and 5 clubs is a very bad idea although some good players disagree with me.|

mb|1N|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not sure I like 1NT with no spade stopper. But it certainly is possible to hope partner has something in spades.|

In Match Points where you don't stretch to bid games I would pass since 3@H is not forcing, and although East has 14 HCP and Ax of hearts is nice the 2 jacks might not be useful, particularly the @DJ. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, in IMPs, especially vul, where you stretch to bid games I think 4@H is reasonable though aggressive.|
