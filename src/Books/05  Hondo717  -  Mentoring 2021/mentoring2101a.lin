nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general you should not bid Stayman with less than an invitational hand.

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is conventionally a takeout double but partner can pass it to convert it to a penalty double. I certainly can't pass with my hand. Double will work out well here, but in general with 6-4 hands you prefer to declare rather than defend.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I clearly want a heart back.

nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BEast: ^*NHow is 4@S so obvious? Aren't we trump heavy possibly and vul?|

cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is possible we will double and you will go for a number. Anything is possible, but it is very unlikely. We have no trump tricks and doubling without trump tricks is hard. Plus partner doesn't need much with a nice fit to make 4 spades.|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example give partner a singleton diamond the @SA, the @HAQ or @HKQ with 11 or 12 points, and 4@S is on a finesse. Not to mention 4@S makes it hard for me to decide what do do.|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the actual hand, we are going to take 3 hearts, 1 diamond and 1 club. So admittedly 4@S is down 2. And if we doubled we would get a good result. But it is hard for me to double with my club length.|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And I know from the bidding partner is short in spades. So I am going to bid 5@C which turns out to be wrong. |MB|5C|
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But 4@S put me to the guess and I guessed wrong which often happens over preemptive bids. You have no scientific way of determining what bid is best and have to make an educated guess. That is why 4@S is right even though it was wrong here.|
