mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let me discuss a good way to play 2/1 that is not standard but works well.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When partner opens 1@D or 1@H (particularly 1@H) and you have a game forcing hand with only 4 spades and a 4+ card minor, it is better to bid 2 of the minor to establish a game force rather than bid 1@S. |
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It makes the rest of the auction much easier. That is not the way most play, though it is recommended by Bergen and I really like it. So I will do that here.|mb|2C|

PG| ***** 6 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P|mb|4C|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@C is a control bid.|

If you play Kickback RKCB, rather than 4NT being RKCB, the suit just above the trump suit is RKCB. So on this hand 4@H is RKCB.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I will bid 4@H which is RKCB. As you will see, this allows me to do the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=queenask,Queen Ask^*N|CP||FP||at|. Obviously, we are in a diamond auction. If we were in a heart auction, I would have bid 3@H over 2@H. In this auction my 3@H was at least a mild slam try in diamonds.|

up|36|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played. Let me suggest a slightly better line of play that guarantees 6, because you will take 6 diamonds, 3 hearts, 1 spade, 1 club, and 1 heart ruff.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On my suggested line of play you cash the @HAQ right away, lead a diamond back to your hand, and ruff a heart. Then cash the @CA, ruff a club, draw the last trump, and lose a spade.|

mb|1H|mb|P|mb|2H|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West has a different hand from what I discussed in the last board. West is not strong enough to bid 2@C to establish a Game Force. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With 3 hearts and 6-9 points, West should always bid 2@H regardless of how many spades he holds ("support with support"). If West had no more than 2 hearts, then he would bid 1@S.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


mb|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If North takes a bid over 2@H, that is just competing. It does not show extra values per se. It appears the points are likely evenly spread out and ^*Bif they have a fit we have a fit.^*n|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Admittedly, at this vulnerability I wouldn't blame North for passing, and, in fact, with only a 5-card diamond suit, I would pass. |
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, with a 6-card suit, I think 3@D is reasonable if a tad aggressive given the heart cards. 3@D is particularly clear if playing Match Points. |
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In IMPs it is not as clear because of the vulnerability. 3@D down 1 is probably essentially a wash. 3@D down 2 (-200) is probably a good board for the opponents. So unless NS can make 3@D and EW can make 2@H (which is possible but hard to know), the risk at IMPs is higher. Having said that, I probably bid 3@D even at IMPs.|

mb|3D|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P|mb|3H|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@H is correct with the West hand. It meets my competitive guidelines of bidding 3 over 3 with a singleton.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You bid 3 over 3 with a) a 9 card fit (LOTT) or b) a singleton in their suit with an 8-card fit. Therefore, 3@H is a good bid because of the singleton diamond.|

That gives partner the option of bidding 5@C, 4@D to show diamonds, or control bidding a major if looking for a club slam.
