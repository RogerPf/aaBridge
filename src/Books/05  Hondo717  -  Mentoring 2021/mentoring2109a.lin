up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us see if declarer could have come up with a different plan. He knows he is losing 3 diamonds at worst, since my lead has to be 4th best because I led the 4 and he sees the 3 and 2), and a spade. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First off he probably should duck the first 2 diamonds. Even if he takes the first diamond, he should lead a spade and continue spades. If speads break 3-3 he will take 4 spades, 1 diamond, 3 hearts, and 1 club for 9 tricks. |
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If spades are not 3-3, then he has 2 spades, 1 diamond, 3 hearts, and a club for sure. That's 7 so he needs 2 more tricks. So if spades are not 3-3 he has to hope the club finesse works. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Note that he would give himself an extra chance by ducking 2 diamonds because if North has both the @SA and @CK, he has no diamonds to lead back and, therefore, the contract will still make. So planning was a bit complicated though doable.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 3@H was an interesting call. I would not have made the bid yet it had some merit. West could deduce we have a spade fit since partner has at most 4 spades and likely fewer. So by bidding 3@H West is making it harder for us to bid spades and in fact it may have worked. If West passes, then North might very well bid 2@S.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Should North bid 3@S over 3@H? That is less clear, although possible. The problem is, the person who is short in hearts has to compete. But West's strength is unknown. Therefore, bidding 3@S has some risk.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is likely we have a spade fit, but it is also possible we may get too high. I also could have stretched and bid 2N over 2@H. But at this vulnerability that is dangerous. So I passed. |
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's look at some alternatives to the current auction. If East opens 1@H, I probably pass. I could stretch and bid 1N but I only have 14, we are vul, and I am 4-3-3-3. So I probably pass.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West presumably bids 1N. It is not clear what North should do, but let's assume pass is the call, particularly if 1N is forcing. North can come in with 2@S later to show long spades and a weak hand.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If North passes, East bids 2@H, I pass, and presumably West passes. Then North bids 2@S and East passes. Then it is not clear what should I do?|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We have at least an 8 card fit and very possibly 9. However, I know partner is weak since he didn't bid 2@S right away. Therefore, with my flat hand I could pass even though I am strong because based on the auction I know partner doesn't have enough for game.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Then West probably bids 3@H. So we might end up there, or I might choose to bid 3@S. Also, it is possible that many pairs would get to 3@S on this hand. In 3@S, if East leads a singleton club, we lose 2 clubs, a club ruff, and 2 diamonds at least. So at best we take 8 tricks.|

mb|P|mb|2S|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East definitely has no clear cut action. I might try 3@H. Most play that forcing (although I play that non-forcing and showing some values). If partner raises to 4@H East would be happy. And if partner rebids 3@S, that is not horrible. However, pass is another reasonable alternative and will probably work better here.|

mb|P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West hand could be an opener because with the West hand if you use Bergen hand Evaluation, you can count 11 "adjusted" HCP, 10 HCP, and 1 for the quality spade suit. Further, it has a wonderful 5-4-3-1 distribution with the points being in the long suits. I probably open West hand 1@C, though I don't think pass is wrong.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you don't play ^*BReverse Drury^*n, I still suggest you play forcing NT even by a passed hand just so you can handle a 3 card limit raise because even though 2@C shows 10-11 points and clubs partner occasionally will pass (since West is a passed hand) and you might miss your heart fit.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That's 20. Additionally, East can add one for the 4 card side diamond suit and two for the singleton (although it being in clubs is a bit of a problem).

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the 4@C bid is a control bid, showing the 1st or 2nd round control in clubs and no control in spades. If East had a spade control, he would have bid 3@S rather than 4@C because you bid the cheapest control you can. Normally a control is an ace or a king or a singleton or a void.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Note that when deciding whether or not to stretch your bid you should tend to be conservative with an 8 card fit and aggressive with a 9 card fit. The 9th trump is often worth an extra trick.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I might try the @CK though given the auction, where it is likely East has the @CA and West could easily have the @CJ a club lead could give away a trick. I could try a spade but I think a heart is still best.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well done. This was not an easy hand to play. 6@H was the correct place to play as they could easily have a heart loser or a diamond loser if spades don't break. Anway the play and bidding were both very nice.|
PG| ***** 98 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*NWould play of last trump be better with possible squezze?|
pg| ***** 99 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, slightly better but this play was fine guaranteed 6 once hearts behaved and 50% 7 if spades were 3-3 or J was doubleton or singleton.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very straight forward auction and easy hand to play. Hand has 9 easy tricks--5 diamonds, 2 clubs, and 2 hearts. The question is what is the best play for an overtrick. I think it depends on whether playing IMPs or Match Points.|
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In IMPs you do not want to endanger the contract. So I would duck a heart and hope that hearts are 3-3. That is 40%.|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In Match Points it might be better to try for an extra spade trick. That would normally be 75% playing for South to have at least one or two spade honors. |
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The problem, however, is because of only one more stopper in clubs declarer can only afford to lose the lead once. Assuming best defense, it takes 2 tries to set up an extra trick in spades.|
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now it is possible that North will not figure out to lead a 2nd club if he has the @CQ. Then the spade play might work. But I still think even in Match Points, I would just duck a heart. It turns out it doesn't work so only make 3 no matter what.|

I don't dislike 2@H, yet so far East is showing likely 5 diamonds and 4 or 5 clubs. Therefore, East might have 2 hearts or could easily have one (or a void on a bad day). |
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I personally take a preference to 2@D. In Match Points, where a major partial is better than a minor partial, sometimes there is some case to bid 2@H. I think in IMPs, however, 2@D is a bit better than 2@H. |
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The heart suit is reasonable with 2 honors and some intermediates and will not be horrible opposite a singleton. One problem, though, is all those spade losers.|
