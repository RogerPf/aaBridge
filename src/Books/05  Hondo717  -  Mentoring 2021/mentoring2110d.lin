mb|P|mb|1D|mb|D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I agree with the double. With an opener you should strain to come in (just like hand 2). Double is imperfect with 3 small hearts, but it is the best North can do.|

That is usually the percentage play. However, in this case I have additional information. Let me explain. |
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So where is the @HQ?
Of course, I can see the four hands and know where the @HQ is. |
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Then how I figured out that it is likely that West holds the @HQ if this was not a teaching session and I could not peek.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West opened the bidding. Based on the first 3 diamond tricks I know West started with the KQJ of diamonds. Based on the spade at trick 4, I know West started with the @SA because East would have won the @SA if they had it. |
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I know 10 HCP that West held. The only high cards the defenders hold that I have not yet placed are the @HQ and @CJ. All the other high cards are accounted for.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Based on all those deducted information, an expert player places the @HQ with West and would not take finesse that he knows going to lose.|

mb|1S|mb|2D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@D is fine, yet I would consider 3@D with the North hand. The 3 card spade suit and only 6 diamonds are a minus. However, the very nice diamonds and singleton are pluses. If not vul, I think 3@D is best. But a vulnerable 2@D is probably as good or even slightly better.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this board, vulnerable or not, if North had the same hand but a singleton spade rather than 3 then 3@D would be clear. Also 3@D would be clear with 7 diamonds.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the otther hand, with 6 diamonds and 3 spades, it is a closer decision so 2@D probably better vulnerable, though 3@D is better not vulnerable. Basically, only take vulnerability into account on close decisions.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this board, North has shown up with 5 diamonds and 3 spades. So North is more likely to be short in clubs. Therefore after winning this trick, West should lead a low club. If North plays low, East should play the @CQ. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people open 1@D with 4 diamonds and 5 clubs. That has some merit. If you open 1@C and partner bids a major, you might be forced to rebid 2@C with a mediocre 5 card suit. So they open 1@D intending to rebid 2@C.|
PG| ***** 98 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't particularly care for that approach, because then partner never knows whether you have 4 diamonds or 5 diamonds and 4 clubs or 5 clubs. But even if you play that in general on North's particular hand, I think 1@C is better than 1@D because North has a reasonable rebid over any major partner bid.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I bid 1@H North can bid 2@H (which you are allowed to do with 3-card support). If bid 1@S, North can bid 1N which is imperfect but many players do that with a singleton spade. So I give North an undo.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My clubs are great if it doesn't get ruffed (e.g. clubs are 3-3) then I am in good shape because with 6 spades to the QJ109 and you almost always having 2 spades, 2@S is a better spot most of the time.|

mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I assume everyone would open my hand despite "only" 10 HCP. This is a hand which illustrates why distribution is often worth as much if not more than HCP. Using Bergen hand evaluation my hand is worth 10 HCP + 3 length points for 13 at least. |
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am sure most experts would value it as closer to 16 or 17. ^*BFreak Hands^*n (hands where you have 11 or more cards in 2 suits) do not evaluate well using standard evaluation. They are always worth much more than they appear.|

The whole point of 2/1 is to take your time and find out where the best spot is. As of now You do not know where we are going the end up in a suit or NT. Your best bid at this point is 3@C.|
