UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, although some disagree, in NT I find that leading your longest and strongest suit is best. And as you noticed, because the lead set up 2 extra diamond tricks and made discarding hard North made 12 tricks instead of the 9 he would have made on a spade lead.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you lead the K against NT, partner signals attitude (high with an honor). So on the @SK lead, West would play the 7 because they hold the @SJ. An expert alternative lead is the @SQ. Normally the Q shows QJ10 or QJ9 (top of a sequence). |
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, it can show KQ10 (although usually it is a 5 card suit) and asks partner to discard the J if he holds it. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if you play that, and partner leads the Q and you see the J in either your hand or dummy you know partner is leading Q from KQ10. On this particular hand I would have led the @SK because I lack the 9 and a 5-card suit.|

PG| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|^*BFast Arrival^*n means if West decides he has a minimum game force with little chance of slam he should jump to 4@S (e.g arrive "fast" to game).|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But if he thinks there is at least some possibility of slam, he bids 3@S ("slow" arrival). Therefore, a 3@S bid should show a good 15 or more.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |

mb|P|mb|4S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East, however, has no slam interest, having a minimum opener. And the singleton heart in the West hand is also a little troublesome given partner has a 5 card heart suit.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Note that in this auction, East's 2@S bid does not show anything extra. If you play 2/1, and the auction starts 1@H/2@C or 2@D, then it is very possible that responder has a 4-card spade suit as on this hand. |
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So opener must bid 2@S to bid out their shape. it does not show anything extra.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BA Kib: ^*NWhy not show the spade suit first, with a 1@S bid?|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because West wants to establish a game force which makes the rest of the auction much easier. In fact, some people play that even if West only had 4 diamonds and 4 spades, they should respond 2@D rather than 1@S.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Establishing the game force really simplifies the auction. I personally play the style where I would respond 2@D with 4 spades and 4 diamonds.|

mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|P|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As a general rule, on this sort of auction, where partner passes after an opponent overcalls you should strain to double in case partner wanted to make a penalty double as apparently she does here.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My competitve guidelines say you bid "3 over 3" if a) you have a 9-card fit or b) you have a singleton.|

^*BNorth: ^*NOnly @CK. After playing the @CA would lead the @CK partner would play @CK if he had it.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Correct. Once again, counting is very important on defense. The way to count a particular suit is to look at how many cards you have between your hand and dummy and you know how many cards there are between the other 2 hands in that suit.|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case North saw 10 clubs between his hand and dummy meaning South and West had 3 clubs. I cashed the @CA and everyone followed. That means the only missing club is the @CK and as North correctly noted, with the @CAK I would have led the King. So North can figure out I am ruffing this trick.|
