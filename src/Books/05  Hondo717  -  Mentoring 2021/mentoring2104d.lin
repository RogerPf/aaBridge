mb|?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay, let me talk about how you handle 5-4 hands over a 1NT opener by partner. I have a very good tutorial about that (here in aaBridge) which I suggest you read -  |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=respond1n54, Responding to 1NT when 5-4 in the Majors^*N|CP||FP||at|.|

PG| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What you bid depends on your strength. The 2@C bid is correct in this case. If East considers this an invitational hand, then here is how East would handle the hand. If West bids 2@H or 2@S, East is very happy and raises. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would raise to 4 personally. If West bids 2@D, denying a major, then East bids 2@S. That sequence shows 4 hearts, 5 spades, and an invitational hand. If East had a game forcing hand and West bid 2@D, East would bid 3@S to show 5 spades 4 hearts and a game force.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you play a convention called "^*BSmolen^*N" East would bid 3@H over 2@D which shows 5 spades and 4 hearts. People play Smolen because it lets the strong hand end up as declarer. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since over 3@H West can bid either spades or NT and end up as declarer. You can play smolen if you like and remember, but I am neutral about playing it. In this case it doesn't matter anyway.|

PG| ***** 31 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The low spade says I want partner to lead back the lower of the 2 remaining suits (clubs here) had I led a high spade that would say lead diamonds.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|At unfavorable vulnerability (we are, they are not) it is somewhat more dangerous to compete but I think double is a reasonable risk to take. Bottom line is, compete aggressively over 1NT. If you don't the opponents will most likely get a good result, because it is easy to bid accurately over 1NT when the opponents don't compete.|

Although you definitely should preempt in 2nd seat, 2nd seat is where preempts are often the least successful because since 1st seat passed, it is much more likely that you will preempt partner. However, that does not mean you shouldn't preempt in 2nd seat. But avoid marginal preempts.|

But using Bergen "adjusted HCP" where you can add at least 1 for the quality diamond suit (in fact you can add even more than one with its 4 honors) the hand qualifies for the rule of 20.

mb|P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Pass is possible with the East hand. But using non-Bergen points, it does meet the rule of 20--12 HCP and 8 cards in the black suits. But Bergen would deduct one for @DQx and Jxx in hearts is not wonderful either. So pass is fine although I probably open 1@C though that is not necessarily a good idea.|
