up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As far as playing clubs, although the club finesse happens to work it is 100% wrong to take it because if it loses and West leads a heart, North is going down. The best way to play the club suit is to hope for a 2-2 break or that East has the 3rd club.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Particularly in Match Points, many would not lead a heart, afraid to give up a trick. But I find that 4th from longest and strongest works best most often against NT (unless the opponents have bid the suit of course).|

mb|2S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Many would not open 2@S because they won't open a weak 2 with an outside 4 card major. Despite what other teachers tell you that is really a wrong reason. Most likely when you have a 6-card suit, that is where you want to play it. |
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, a preempt is meant to be a destructive bid against the opponents not a constructive bid. You are taking a calculated risk (which often works well) that making it hard for the opponents is to your advantage. You are not worrying about precise bidding. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another reason that some won't open East's had a weak 2 is that East only has 4 HCP and theoretically a weak 2 shows 5-10. However, there are at least 2 good reasons why a weak 2 by East is still correct.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|a) East is at favorable vulnerability (their side not vul, the opponents vul). That is an ideal time to preempt and you should strain to do so, even stretching if necessary.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|b) East has wonderful 6-4 distribution, which makes the 4 point hand much better than some hands with several more HCP.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


mb|2N|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|lb|*bBid for North.^^3N|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With a nice 5 card suit that could easily take 5 tricks North must bid 3NT. Although it is a risk and I might only have 15 HCP and not make 3N.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Again, HCP are only part of the equation when evaluating your hand. Using Bergen hand evaluation, North is worth 10 points, by adding 1 length point and 1 quality suit point. So 3N is clear, although it is certainly possible it will go down.|

pc|HQ|sk|s|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have 5 club tricks presumably, 2 spades, and 1 diamond. That is 8 tricks. I suspect the opponents will take the first three trick. After, I will plan my play.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me plan the hand now that the opponents have taken the first 3 tricks and I have won the 4th trick with the @SJ. I have 2 spade tricks, 5 club tricks, and 1 diamond trick. That comes to 8 tricks. The highest percentage way to get a 9th trick is to take the diamond finesse.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is quite possible that East holds the @DK. Why?
I know East has no HCP in clubs and hearts and only the @SA. The only HCP in question are which opponent holds the @DK and @DJ.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East opened a weak 2@S, which usually shows 5-10 HCP. Since the only HCP East has shown is the @SA, it is quite possible East holds the @DK, since that would give East 7 HCP. Unfortunately, on this hand West holds the @DK, so I am down one, losing 3 hearts, 1 spade, and 1 diamond.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out that if I could see all 4 hands, given the defense, I can make the hand. How?
After winning the @SJ, I cash the @SK. I then run 5 club tricks. At this point, East's remaining cards are the @HA and DKJ. |
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Then, If I lead a heart, West must win the @HA and will be end played. West must lead a diamond away from the @DKJ. That will give me 2 diamond tricks and I will make the hand.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With slightly more HCP (say for example North had the @DQ also) North could bid 3@S, looking for 3N if I had a club and diamond stoppers. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@S would not be natural because with a spade suit North would bid 2@S with 5 card suit or double with a 4 card suit and retreat to diamonds if I bid hearts. Here I would pass.|

PG| ***** 80 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But, as an interesting note, I could count "declarer" points instead of dummy points because "declarer points" are counted by the hand with longer trump.

PG| ***** 100 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's count North's declarer points discounting the @DK completely. North has 14 HCP, 2 length points, 1 quality suit point, 1 for the 4+ card side suit, and 2 for the singleton for 20 |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=declarerpoints,Bergen Declarer Points^*N|CP||FP||at| which is enough for slam if we are not missig Key cards.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, it is interesting as to whether the singleton in North's hand should count or not since I am known to have a singleton diamond also.

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if West passes and North bids RKCB (4@S if playing kickback) I bid 5@H (2 keys and the trump queen) and North bids 6@H.|
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I bid 5@H which for 2 Key Cards and the trump queen while I do not have the @HQ because I know we have an 11 card fit. So the trump queen is not a loser even if it is missing. Whenever you respond to RKCB and you know your side has a 10+ card fit you should show the trump queen even if you don't have it.|
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 5@D, East/West lose 2 clubs, 1 spade and 1 heart for only down 2 which is an excellent sacrifice. This was a very interesting hand.|

However, North's hand meets the |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=ruleof20,Rule of 20^*N|CP||FP||at| even without using Bergen hand evaluation. It has 9 HCP plus 11 cards in the 2 longest suits and the quality suit adds another point. So it actually meets the rule of 21. I will undo 1@H bid because 4@H is a very good opening bid particularly since it is likely the opponents have spades fit.|

up|41|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once again with 22 HCP we easily make game because of the nice distribution. Notice that we could even give the @CQ and @CJ to EW (meaning NS would only have 19 HCP) and 4@H still makes.|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On another point, some may bid 5@C with the West hand. That is not necessarily to make. But 6-4 is wonderful distribution. And not vul against vul, even if it is doubled and goes down it is likely to be a reasonable sacrifice or push North/South to bid 5@H.|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Whenever you have shortness in the opponents suit you want to strain to play the hand. Note that if West bids 5@C, North should double with 4 clubs and that is very good for North/South because West loses at least 2 diamonds, 2 spades and 1 club for down 3. All considered, pass was by West was best.|

Note that playing 2/1 Game Forcing where 2@C over 1@D is a game force (although some play it is not, but assuming it is) the 2@H bid is not a reverse. It is simply bidding out shape.|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West, with 5 clubs and a 4 card major, would bid 2@C rather than 1 of a major over 1@D. Establishing the game force is 1st priority. Once that is done, they can find their major fit if need be.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well planned. Once North ducks the @CK East can count 9 tricks and need not worry about losing too many diamonds. Just remember to unblock suits by cashing the honors in the short hand first. On this board that was true in both spades and hearts. Both suits had to be unblocked.|
