nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And North has 8 very likely tricks - 6 clubs and 2 aces. North could easily get a 2nd diamond trick. So, if North's long suit had been in a major, I think 2@C is reasonable although a tad aggressive.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, my tendency when my suit is a minor and I have a marginal 2@C opener is not to open 2@C because the auction will go most likely as 2@C-P-2@D-P-3@C. So 2@C actually sort of self preempts the auction as your first natural bid is at the 3-level.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In real life North probably would make 3N unless an expert East was defending. I coached East to lead the @HK and not to discard any hearts. Many non-expert defenders would have led the @H7 and discarded a heart in which case North makes 3NT.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, had North opened 1@C, the auction should go as 1@C-1@S-3NT. A jump to 3NT (as opposed to 2NT) shows a long running minor suit - 6 or 7 tricks and stoppers in the 2 unbid suits. If you have a balanced 18-19 you rebid 2N, not 3N.|
