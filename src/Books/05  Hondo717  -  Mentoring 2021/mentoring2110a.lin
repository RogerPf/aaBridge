Whenever there is a preempt and you compete you are playing the odds and assuming partner on average will have around 8 points or so. On this hand East is probably slightly above average and has 10 points. The 4 card support is good. |
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If East were deciding whether or not to raise 3 of a major to 4, then it would be clear to do so. However, 5 clubs is an 11 trick contract, and those are much more difficult to make than 10 card contracts. So I think pass is reasonable although I would not criticize you for bidding 5@C.|

mb|2C|mb|P|mb|2Dp2n|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's go over the bidding so far. Opening 2NT shows 20-21. East's HCP are 8 in diamonds, 5 in clubs, 2 in hearts, 7 in spades for 22 and not to mention a 5-card quality diamond suit which is an upgrade. So East had a clear 2@C opener intending to rebid 2N over the likely 2@D response.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 2@D is reasonable. 2@H is possible but that is supposed to show a 5+ card suit with 2 of the top 3 honors. West has a 6-card quality suit though not the required top honors. However, I would not dislike it if they bid 2@H. But, 2@D is fine.|

mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Of course, West wants to play in hearts and wishes to explore for slam. Therefore, assuming you play Texas Transfer, West should bid 4@D and then do RKCB.|

mb|4H|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now overlookng my intention about how to raise with 3-card support, had West bid 2@C, my choice, then the auction would have proceeded as 
^j 1@H  -  p  -  2@C  -  p  -  2@D  -  p  -  4@H
 Here 4@H is known as "fast arrival."|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One important principle of 2/1 game forcing is that once a game force is established the slower you get to game the stronger you are. So over 2@D, 4@H is the weakest bid West can make. It says West barely had a game forcing hand.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In short, my rule is you always show 4 card support if you have it. With a limit raise hand and 4-card support I do not bid 2/1. Depending on the hand I bid 2N or |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=splinters,Splinter^*N|CP||FP||at|. Knowing you have a 9 card fit is often crucial. So if I bid 2@C I do not have 4-card support.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a hard hand to play. However, once the @CA is cashed East might want to just cross ruff the hand after discarding the losing spade on the @CK and probably ends up losing 2 hearts and a club at worst.|
