nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It wasn't a wonderful contract but it had plays. Although West had a clear 2@H bid, it was a very weak 2@H bid with only 7 HCP (and the @HJ really not worth much) and no short suits. West could take off a point for 4-3-3-3 he still had a 2@H bid.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On average, after 2 passes, the first 2 players average around 16 points which means the second 2 players average 24.

pc|SJ|pc|S7|pc|D2|pc|D4|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As an expert defender I can figure out West's distribution. I know West started out with 5 hearts and West can't have 5 spades because he would have opened 1 spade. |
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So West probably has 4 spades (although might have 3) and if playing count, I know partner's @D10 was a doubleton (or maybe a singleton). |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If doubleton then West started with 2 diamonds. Therefore, a likely (although not certain) distribution for West is 4-5-2-2. Anyway, the point is that is what expert defenders think about.|

mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let me discuss how I handle hands with 6-4 in the majors. With 6 spades and 4 hearts, as I have here, I rebid 2@H. But if I had 6 hearts and 4 spades (and of course opened 1@H) I would still rebid 2@H which is cheaper than bidding 2@S.|

I would bid 3N with a club stopper. But with my current hand I will bid out my shape and North will bid 3N reluctantly since we have a misfit.|
