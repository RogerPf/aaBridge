nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So East should bid 3@S to show that hand. Some players only "super accept" if they have 16 or 17 and that is fine. However, I personally Super Accept even with 15 unless I have a really bad 15.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think Super Accept worked well on this hand because had East only bid 2@S, there is a good case to be made that West should pass. But here they got to a reasonable game.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|
pc|H2|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now East needs to do some planning here. Although most of the times you need to draw trump immediately, on this hand, it looks like a cross ruff is best. And because of the fortunate opening lead, East can also get rid of a club loser.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So let's follow a good way to play the hand and count tricks. Say East plays a heart to the @HJ after winning the opening lead.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|To summarize the points we have learned from this hand:
^^^cA)  @2You should super accept by bidding to the 3 level after a transfer when you have 4 card support.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|^^^^^cB)  @2You should plan the hand out before playing to trick 1 by counting your tricks. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|^^^^^cC)  @2Although it is often correct to draw trump immediately, sometimes you must delay doing so. The most common case, which is what occurred on this hand is when you need to ruff several losers in the short hand. On this deal, East needed to delay drawing trump because East needed to ruff 3 diamonds.|

cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good defensive carding by North playing the @HJ (cheapest of equals as 3rd hand) as opposed to the @HQ. In fact, had North played the @HQ, it would have denied the @HJ.|

That way the suit doesn't block. If West played a low spade first, then the suit would block, meaning West couldn't play a 3rd round of spades immediately without first getting back to the hand.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand the @HK happens to be an entry as well as the diamonds. But in general unblocking suits is best. Had I played low, the spade finesse would have been correct and as we see, West was intending to take the finesse |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BEast: ^*NIs a 1NT response forcing even if by a passed hand?|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a good question. Most play it is not forcing. But I don't agree. For example, suppose responder has a 3-card limit raise (10-12 points and 3 card support). |
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|They shouldn't make a limit raise as that promises 4-card support. But they could easily end up in 1NT instead of their 8 card fit. So I personally think you should play 1NT forcing even by a passed hand although that is probably a minority opinion. |
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Regarding doubletons, when you have found an 8+ card fit, you can add an extra point for 2 (or rarely 3) doubletons, but not 2 points. You do not add any points if you have only 1 doubleton. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In Rule of 20 you take your points (I will define "points" in a moment) and add that to the length of your 2 longest suits. If that equals 20 you have a 1 level opener. So hands with long suits can and should be opened with fewer HCP.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand I have 10 HCP and 10 cards in spades and clubs. So I should open 1@S. Points are HCP plus some other Bergen addons which you can find them in my lessons on Bergen Hand Evaluation.|

mb|1S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|2D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West has simply a 2@D overcall and does not have a takeout double. An overcall does not deny a good hand, although at the 2-level it can be made on as few as 10 points.|

PG| ***** 58 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|3D|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I like the  3@D bid. Whenever the opponents have an 8 card fit and the points are approximately even between the 2 sides you should try very hard to not let them play at the 2 level.

PG| ***** 75 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That depends on your agreement. The Kib is right in that many pairs usually have the agreement that if I bid 3@S over 2@S that is invitational. That is a reasonable way to play. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But experts playing against other experts know that it is unlikely that the opponents will let them play in 2@S. So they "pre compete" to 3@S to prevent their opponents from being able to describe their hand.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In other words, since I knew I was going to bid 3@S if the opponents did not let me play in 2@S I would bid 3@S right away to shut the opponents out.|

mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|mb|1N?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The convention I highly recommend for competing over 1NT is |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dont,DONT^*N|CP||FP||at|. Over 1NT if you bid a suit, it shows a 2 suited hand with at least 5-4 in the 2 suits. It shows the suit bid and a higher suit. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So here if West had say 5 diamonds and 4 hearts, West could bid 2@D, showing diamonds and either hearts or spades. East would pass with 3 diamonds or otherwise bid 2@H, asking West to pass with hearts and bid 2@S with spades. |
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you double 1NT that shows a single suited hand - your suit needs to be 6 cards long. Over the double, East bids 2@C and West passes with clubs or bids their actual suit. Unfortunately, since West is not 5-4 he must pass.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, I opened 1NT with a 5-card major. You definitely should do that when you have 5-3-3-2 distribution and 15-17 points because if I open 1@H, unless partner raises, it is very hard for me to get the strength of my hand across.|

pc|D4|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Many these days like to always lead unbid majors against NT even if they are short in the suit they lead. But I firmly believe in 4th from your longest and strongest (unless the oppponents have bid the suit).|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So here a diamond is fine although since West's hearts are almost as strong as the diamonds, a heart would have been okay also.|

But since East led back the @D9, there is a good chance East has the remaining diamond and I can never get to cash the @DAQ or @DJ.  I don't have good prospects for too many tricks.|

mb|P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Pass is fine with the North hand because of the vulnerability. But if North were not vulnerable I personally would open 3@C, although most players would not. You should aggressively preempt.|
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2^*BNorth: ^*NWouldn't that show weak hand with 7 carder?|
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because you can't make a Weak-2 in clubs, if you have good distribution (singleton or void), you can open 3@C with 6 clubs sometimes. However, given the vulnerability I would not do it here.|
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


mb|2C|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 99% of the time, responder should bid 2@D over 2@C as a "waiting bid" allowing opener to describe why they opened 2@C. |
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But rarely you bid something other than 2@D, usually 2@H or 2@S. A 2@H or 2@S bid over 2@C shows a 5+-card suit with 2 of the top 3 honors. Therefore, here West has a 2@S response to 2@C.|
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


mb|2S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The only question East has is whether to bid 6@S or 7@S. East can count 12 sure tricks--5 spades, 5 diamonds, and 2 aces. |
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is no way to find out if West has 6 spade in which case they can make 7@S. So East should bid 4NT. And if West has an outside king, then 7@S will make.|
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


mb|4N|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Assuming you play 0314 West should bid 5@D, showing 1 key card. Although it doesn't really matter, but I like 0314 better than 1430.|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


mb|5D|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now East can bid 5NT asking about kings. I like to play "specific kings" meaning if West has one or more outside kings they bid the cheapest king they have.|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


mb|5N|mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|at|In this case, West has the @HK, so if playing specific kings, they bid 6@H to show it.|
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


mb|6H|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Specific kings is better than number of kings, because usually you want to know which king partner has when deciding whether or not to bid 7.|

mb|1C|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|mb|P1HP1SP?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now West has a bit of a rebid problem. With 11 HCP  West has an invitational hand. I really like the club suit particularly since partner opened 1@C. However, the @DK singleton is dubious. So I would bid 3@C.|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@C is not game forcing. It shows an invitational hand with nice clubs and can be passed. If West wanted to force to game, they would have to bid 2@D which is an artificial bid. |
