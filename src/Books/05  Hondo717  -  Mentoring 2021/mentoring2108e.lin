Here, declarer started with 3 diamonds and dummy with 5. So we started with 5 between North and South. We have played 2 rounds of the suit and both of us followed, so the only diamond left is the @DK. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|New suits by responder below game are forcing at all levels. If West bids 3@S, East will bid 4@S (although North will probably bid 4@H first). Anyway, after East bids 4@S, West will use RKCB to discover no key cards are missing and they will end up in 6. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You might wonder should West be worried about 2 diamond losers. In theory yes. However, since East opened 1@D, and there is no room to control bid, it is reasonable for West to assume that East has a diamond control.|

It applies whenever opener starts with 1 of a minor. Here I opened 1@C, and responder (North) bids 1 of a major and the next player interferes which is the case here and we must be below responder's suit at the 2-level. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general I think you should compete aggressively and it is rarely right to let the opponents play at the 2 level when the points are evenly split. On this particular hand, though, I think East should have passed 2@H.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I mean, it probably doesn't matter, but since I bid clubs, I think that makes it slightly better to lead a diamond. However, as it turns out, a club is better after all.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East can count out the diamond suit. The way you count out a suit is you look at the number of cards you and dummy have. And you can, therefore, deduce what partner and declarer have. East started with 5 diamonds and dummy with 3 for a total of 8. |

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|At trick ten West did make a discarding error. West should discard her @CJ and keep Qxx in spades. No reason to hold onto the @CJ which is a sure loser. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that, then North should realize the only hope for a 3rd spade is the remaining spades are 2-2 and play @SA and @SK and hope the 3rd spade is good. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Playing a low spade has no hope of working and cost an extra trick. It turns out that with best defense 3NT is down 2. But with the misdiscarding it is down 1.|

1. 2@H shows a minimum opener (13-16 Bergen dummy points);
2. 3@H is invitational (17-19 dummy points) asking me to bid 4@H with 8+ declarer points;
3. 4@H is strong (20+). It is NOT a shutout bid. if I am strong (e.g have an opener) I should look for slam.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here 4@H is correct.

The hand is very easy to play, might make 6 if no diamond lead but probably still only 5.|

mb|1D|mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If playing 2 over 1, West should bid 2@C over 1@D even with 4 clubs and 4 hearts if that is your agreement. You want to establish a Game Force ASAP. With 5 clubs and 4 hearts, even if you wouldn't bid 2@C with 4 clubs, you have to bid 2@C with 5 clubs.|
