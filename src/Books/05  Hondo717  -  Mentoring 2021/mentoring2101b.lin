nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, as North, I would bid 4@H, which shows a hand with lots of hearts and a minimum game force with not much slam interest.|mb|4H|

mb|3C?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have 5-5 in majors. My hand got a lot worse once West shows hearts.I certainly don't want to bid hearts and partner doesn't have 4 spades. So even if we have an 8 card spade fit we are probably getting a bad break. Therefore, I should either pass or double.|

PG| ***** 118 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Start with 1@S.   1@S here is forcing and unlimited. Over takeout doubles you need to know the following.|
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|
1 level bids are forcing
2 level bids are WEAK (not strong). 

^cFor example if West had bid 2@C over my double that would show basically a weak 2 in clubs.|
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With a stronger hand West would redouble. All that is somewhat counter intuitive. But you need to know it.|

AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Pass by East is reasonable particularly since there is some chance that I have 4 spades and West might have 4 spades. But West did take a "free bid" in the sense that West could have passed.|
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the 1@S bid does show something that she wants partner to know about. It is likely 5+ spades but it doesn't have to be. It could just be a good hand. However, with 4 spades and 10+ points West would often redouble. So it is more likely than not that West has 5 spades.|

mb|4S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In IMPs that is what I would bid. Partner bid 3@S without knowing East have any support. So West probably has 6 spades. And East wants to stretch to bid game with a 9 card fit. In Match Points I pass, because bidding close games is not worth it.|
