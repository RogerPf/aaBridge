up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First let me address what should North bid. I do strain to open and overcall 1N if at all possible. |
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if East had opened 1 of a minor, I might overcall 1NT even with 3 small in opener's minor because there is a good chance opener has a 3 or at most 4 card minor but over a major, I don't like to overcall 1NT without at least a semblance of a stopper. |
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I can see why North is reluctant to double, in case I bid clubs. However, I think double is best.
I will do that on occasion with a doubleton honor in a minor, and if partner happens to bid that minor, I just tell him "I owe you a club." |
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some players use a convention called "Equal Level Conversion Doubles" which works well on this hand. That means, if you double, and partner bids a suit, and you correct to the next higher suit, that shows 2 suits not 3. |
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So in this case if playing Equal Level Conversion (ELC) if I bid 2@C, North bids 2@D showing diamonds and hearts and I pass or correct. ELC promises 5 diamonds and 4 hearts. |
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But even if you don't play ELC, you can double with a good hand and a doubleton honor in one of the unbid minors. The reason being, partner will strain to bid a major. It might not work out on occasion, but it will work out more often than not.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We do make 2@H taking 4 hearts, 1 ruff, 1 spade, 1 club, and 1 diamond. 3@H undoubled down 1 is about equivalent in IMPs to their making 2@S. |
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If North had doubled and East bids 2@S, aggressive but I like it at this vul, I probably bid 3@H and partner might bid 4@H which doesn't work out so well.|

mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I agree with East's pass, particularly holding 5 hearts. However, if East doubled North's 2@D bid, that would show diamonds. A double of an artificial bid shows the suit bid. If, after West made the DONT bid, East doubled, that would ask West to bid their other suit. |
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West has shown clubs and another suit (probably not hearts). So a double by East after the 2 passes is essentially a takeout double, and says East wants to play either 2@S or 3@D, whichever is West's other suit besides clubs.|
