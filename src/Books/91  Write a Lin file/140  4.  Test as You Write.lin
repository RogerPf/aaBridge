^b@2So you have written a small lin file in your text editor and want to test it @-

^c@.   |cp|7|at|^*bDrag n Drop^*n|cp||at| on to ^*baaBridge^*n, any files you want to work on. They will appear in gray column on your left.

                       (Windows users can instead double click on single .lin files.)

Your file will now appear in that column exactly as does the title to this file, black text in a white box.  Note the
|cp|7|at|^*bNavigation Bar^*n|cp||at|.  The cream and grey line, with bobbles on it, at the bottom of this window. Clicking on that bar will move you to that point in your lin file.           |cp|5|at|(For  ^*bWindows users  ^*ndouble clicking just one file should also work.)|cp||at|

The  'edit and test cycle'  is now as follows -

^c@2@.   Move to the place in your file where you are about to make changes, so you can see that area in aaBridge.

^c@2@.   You are in your editor happily editing away - until you decide you want see what your changes look like.

^c@2@.   Save the file from inside your editor (as normal).

^c@2@.   Your changes will appear on the page in aaBridge as if by Magic.


^b@2You can of course  ^*b Step ^*n or ^*b Flow ^*n  normally to see any changes you have done on other pages.
  
This is called a   'zero click'   edit and test cycle  @-  enjoy.
