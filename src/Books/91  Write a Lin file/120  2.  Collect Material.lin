^b@2Gather your material.

^c@2@.   If you played or watched an interesting hand where you play on-line perhaps
^k you can download it as a lin file or convert it to a lin file.

@.   OR you want to comment on a hand from Bridge history
^k ^*Hwww.sarantakos.com/bridge/vugraph.html^*n

@.   OR if you played at hand at your club, and can remember it, you can input it with the ^*b aaBridge ^*n hand editor.

@.   OR if you are setting a double dummy problem, then again the ^*b aaBridge ^*n hand editor is a good place to start.


Whatever the original sources you should end up with one or more small lin files as your core input.
^d (OK it is true you don't need any of this, as can you CAN do it all from scratch.  But why make life harder?) 
 

It is also worth getting some good example lin files @- the very best on the web can be downloaded from 
^d Howard Schutzman website,   ^k ^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge^*n 


You can also look at the text in ^*ball^*n .lin files embedded in this .jar file   (see chapter  |cp|7|at|^*bBook into Jar^*n|cp||at|^*n)
