^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As for lead in this hand, I play count from 3 small and I choose to lead a heart. In general, if you want to make a neutral lead you should lead the longest unbid suit in which you have no honor. That way, even if you finesse partner, the finesse was working anyway. Leading away from an honor often gives away a trick.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I prefer leading low from 3 small as do many experienced players. I find count more useful than attitude. But most less experienced players prefer attitude. The question is, with 10xx should you lead the 10?|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If playing top of nothing leading the 10 as top of nothing could give away a trick. So some would lead the H6 if leading a heart. But to make it less confusing, leading the 10 is ok if that is your agreement about what you lead from 10xx.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The play was fine. However, I take issue with East opening 1@S. The hand does not meet the rule of 20. Some would open the hand in 3rd seat. But opening flat 11 counts in 1st or 2nd seat is not usually a good idea. I personally don't even open it in 3rd seat but many would. Had East passed, the hand ends up being passed out probably.|

mb|P|mb|P|NT||lb|*yShould East strongly consider bidding 4H?^^y|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On pure HCP East's bid is correct. However, once there is a super accept, East's hand is a lot better. Let's count Bergen "Declarer" Points for East and see if perhaps 4@H is warranted.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Note that although East is not going to be declarer, East still counts Declarer points using Bergen evaluation. "Declarer Points" are counted by the hand with the longer trump. The person with the longer trump is usually declarer since they tend to bid the suit.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But you should think of "Declarer Points" as "hand with the longer trump points." So on a few auctions, particularly transfer auctions, dummy ends up counting Declarer Points.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT|^B@2
mcannon: Do I take 6 for the void--diamond? I'm dummy.|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You are correct. You are dummy and your add-on in this hand, as a dummy, for a diamond void is six--the number of trumps. However, remember you are counting Declarer Points because you have the longer trump suit.|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me repeat. The hand with the ^*Blonger trump^*N counts declarer points whether or not they are actually declarer. The declarer usually has the longer trump suit. |
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, in certain bidding situations such as transfer auctions dummy counts as a declarer would though THE DUMMY STILL IS THE DUMMY [Movie Maker's add-on].|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Finally, East has ^*B11 Declarer Points^*N--3 HCP, 2 length points, 4 points for the void, 1 point for 4 spades, and 1 points for 6th heart once there is a fit. So there is a case to be made for 4@H bid but I will let 3@H stand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now, what do I know about spades?. Partner could have QJ doubleton. But more likely has @SQJx. I know West has at least 2 spades which means partner started with 2 or 3 spades and does not have the @SSK. Sso playing another spade will simply set up the 4th spade.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Therefore, I need to play clubs. In the middle of the hand you lead attitude. So my low club means I have a club honor and since the @CJ is on the board, that means I have the @CK.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out with perfect defense, 4@H goes down. However, had I let North lead a diamond as was the original intent or had I not returned a club, which many players would not then West will make 4@H. Even though technically 4@H is an overbid it would make more often than not. That is one reason you should be aggressive, especially when bidding games because you often get imperfect defense.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|if we don't lead a club, at least 1 goes on the @DA and if West takes the ruffing finesse against the @DK then West can get rid of all the club losers and actually make 5 or 6.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let me discuss a more sophisticated |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=superaccepts,Super Acccept^*N|CP||FP||at|. I am not suggesting you play this necessarily but it is certainly an improvement over standard super accepts. Here how it works.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If partner transfers and you have 4-card support rather than just bidding 3 of partner's suit you bid a suit in which you have a doubleton. So in this case, were West playing sophisticated super accepts, West would bid 2@S to show 4 hearts and a doubleton spade.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That sometimes help responder even have a better idea of whether or not 4 is going to make or not. On the rare instances where opener is 4-3-3-3 with 4-card support they bid 2NT with a good 16 or 17 and 3 of partner's suit with 15.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you play sophisticated super accepts, you should bid any doubleton. If you only bid worthless doubletons, you will rarely be able to play sophisticated super accepts because when you open 1NT you usually do not have a worthless doubleton.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So either decide to play it as showing any doubleton or don't bother to play it IMO.|

We lose 1 spade, 1 heart, 1 club, and 2 diamonds. Probably down 1. It only works out if you defend correctly. Once again proving why aggressive bidding works even when you get to seemingly beatable contracts. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West was unlucky to go down in 3, losing 2 finesses. On the other hand, it does go to show why flat hands are not as good as their HCP indicate.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You should prefer more distributional hands with fewer HCP to flat hands with more HCP. For example on the previous hand, where North was 6-4 with 9 HCP. That was a much better hand than the flat 11 counts that East and West had.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Assuming we accept the bid by East, the question is should I make a takeout double or bid 1@H. Personally I prefer with 5-4 in the majors, to overcall my 5 card suit rather than make a takeout double because if I double it will be hard to get across that I have a 5-card suit.|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Also, I do risk missing a 4-4 fit. But more often than not a) we don't have one b) we have a 5-3 fit anyway or c) partner has 5 cards in the other major and bids them. On this hand over 1@D I think it is clear to bid 1@H.|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I have a terrific heart suit and ok but not great spades. But even with better spades and worse hearts I still would tend to overcall 1@H. Now back to East opening bid.|

PG| ***** 127 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East brings a good point. Most players use 15-17 HCP to open 1N although these days 14+-17 is not uncommon. On he other hand Bergen says you can and should add 1 point for a 5-card suit even when deciding whether or not to open 1NT. But I don't agree.|
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Here is what I do. I count both my HCP and my |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=bergenstartingpoints,Bergen Starting Point Count^*N|CP||FP||at|. If my HCP say I should open 1NT I do. But if my Bergen counts are two higher than my HCP (for example, say East's hand counted to 19 Bergen Starting Points) then I will upgrade and open 1D intending to rebid 2NT.|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So I sort of use Bergen Starting Point count when deciding about whether or not to bid NT. But Bergen has to be different by 2 not 1 for me to upgrade and not bid 1N. Anyway, I would open 1NT with the East hand but Bergen would open 1@D. So I am going to give East an undo.|

The idea behind DONT is to compete at the 2-level. So, absent competition, you try to stay at the 2-level. Yes, if you have a real good hand (which is rare) you might want to raise.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The DONT bid worked out well as it often does. You should strain to bid DONT whenever you have the distribution for it particulary if it goes 1N-P-P=?. Letting them play 1NT is rarely going to be a good result. It is at best an average result and often below average.|

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|A response at the two-level here would promise 10+ points so the only option left for us here is to respond 1NT, which shows 6 to 9 points.|
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Remember that a 1NT response here does not promise a balanced hand (although you might always prefer to have a balanced hand to make the bid).|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Having said this, we do acknowledge that some 9 point hands would be able to respond at the two-level. For example, if your hand were:@S 4 @H 9 5 @D A K Q 9 8 7 3 @C 9 6 3
 It would be perfectly respectable to respond 2@D with this hand. The suit quality of the Diamond suit is much too great to ignore and thus the hand could be "upgraded" to a 2@D response.|mb|1n|

So there are eight tricks on top and, with the Spade lead coming round to your @SQ, you will have a Spade trick to add on to that.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|North's double is for take-out. You are playing the Lebensohl convention where you can show a weak hand by responding with 2NT. A response of 3@H will show around 8-10 points instead.|

^B@2^*BMovie Maker: Next is comments by Howard Schutzman on Lebensohl.|
PG| ***** 182 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some pairs play the Lebensohl convention after partner makes a takeout double of a weak 2-bid. That means with a weak hand, responder bids 2N as a conventional bid. That forces the doubler to bid 3@C. Responder passes with clubs or corrects to his suit. That sequence shows a weak hand (no more than 7 or perhaps a bad 8 and usually less). If you play that, then an immedate 3 level bid by responder (such as what happened on this hand), shows an invitational hand.|
PG| ***** 183 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I am not a big fan of this convention. It is overly complicated and puts responder in complete charge of the auction. And there are some hands where opener would like a more cooperative auction with both partners participating. I have seen many examples where pairs who use this convention get to a bad contract when using standard bidding would have gotten them to the correct contract. So I have pretty strong feelings that you should not play this (although you may run into some good players who disagree with me).|
PG| ***** 184 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So, on this hand, not playing Lebensohl, I would assume a likely 9-card heart fit (partner strongly rates to have 4 hearts) and count declarer points. I have 9 HCP, 1 length point, 1 quality suit point, 1 point for 2 doubletons, and 1 point for the side 4-card diamond suit. That's 13 declarer points, more than enough to jump to 4@H. In fact, even if I played Lebensohl, I would bid 4@H with the South hand. I think 3@H is a pretty big underbid.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|Even knowing you had 8-10 points that's a thin raise from North. There will be some finesses in this one. You need to think carefully about the play.|

NT|^B@2
Indeed, it does! East holds eleven non-spades and West has only seven. This makes East a substantial favorite to hold the @HQ. But first take the tricks in clubs.|
