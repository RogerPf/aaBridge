^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even absent a bid by West (I will discuss that bid later) many advanced players would bid 2@H with the North hand. If it goes 1@D-P-1@H-P-2@H, 2@H tends to show 4 hearts. But it does NOT guarantee 4 hearts particularly when you have a singleton and 3 hearts to an honor, you should bid 2@H even though you don't have 4. |
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Many players are reluctant to raise with 3 hearts but they should not be. Yes, there is a risk that you are only in a 7-card fit but there is also a reward that when you "support with support" you will make it easier to get to the best spot particularly if you can bid game. However, you should not be reluctant to raise with 3-card support when you have the appropriate hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you can see, you need to plan out the hand. Once I did that, it become much easier to figure out how to make my contract.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West's 1NT overcall although technically correct was pretty dangerous. We have at least half the deck or more based on the bidding. So even though West has 15 HCP, partner has at best 5 HCP or so. further, balanced hands are not as good as they look. For example my 5-5 10 count was actually at least as good, if not better, than West's 15 point hand on offense.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You should be very reluctant to overcall 1NT in 4th seat after both opponents have bid. In fact, many players play that 1NT in 4th seat is what is called a "sandwich NT." It does not show 15-18 as it does normally. It shows a weakish hand with the other 2 suits, probably 5-4 or 5-5.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Should East transfer to spades? She could, but since the double is not penalty but conventional it is not going to be passed out. So I think pass was a better call on this auction. Had North passed, then East certainly should bid 2@H transfer to spades.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out that 4@H can be set if East figures out to lead back a club. Should East figure that out? It is certainly possible to do so. It comes down to counting. East can see 9 clubs between East and dummy. That means there are 4 clubs between West and South.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West led the @C4 and the 3 and 2 are in dummy. That means West can't have a doubleton. So West has either 1 or 3 clubs. And since South opened 1NT, West must have a singleton since South cannot have a singleton. Good defense requires lots of detective work.|

NT|^B@2
The other is to try and pitch 2 hearts on dummy's long diamonds. That requires a 3-3 diamond break or a doubleton @DQ. That is also 50%--the 3-3 diamonds is 40% and the doubleton queen adds 10%.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You don't need to memorize all bridge odds, but it is sometimes useful to know the more common odds. So I can play the hand either way. It turns out either play will work. But I will try the diamond discard route just to show you how to play the hand in a slightly more complicated fashion.|

PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Yes, North should worry about spades but there is no guarantee that 5@C will make either. You can't always worry about all suits being stopped. It is ok to bid 3NT even if you are not sure about 1 suit. Usually it works out.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Here, 5@C could make. But it is almost always easier to make 9 tricks than 11 tricks. If you always bid 3NT when you have a choice between 3N and 5 of a minor, you will come out ahead in the long run even though this hand is a counter example.|

You have a way to find out at this point. You now bid 6@H. That asks partner to bid 7@S with the @HK. In this sequence, 6@H over 6@D says "partner bid 7@S if you have the @HK."|

In general you should lead away from kings or queens against 6 of a suit. Make a neutral lead against 6N. A trump lead against 6 is normally not a good lead although it does work out here. You should normally make an aggressive lead against 6 of a suit|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't like leading doubletons but on this hand, that is the best choice IMO from a bad set of choices. Leading a spade from Jx is dangerous (although it works out on this hand). Leading an unprotected ace is usually a bad play. Leading a diamond when East has bid diamonds is not normally a good idea. Hence a club by the process of elimination and it does not give anything away.|pc|CT|

Here we bring you the most critical part.|
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|A refresher on our three strategies: 
1. LONG dummy suggests we come out with fists flying. We can't afford to wait for the hand to develop, as once the declarer gains his tempo, he'll use the declarer strategy of dumping all his losers on dummy's long suit. Attack! |
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


NT|^B@2
2. SHORT dummy is going to enable the declarer to use the trump in dummy strategy. Usually we can best short-circuit this by pulling his teeth. Lead trumps!! |
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


NT|^B@2
3. DEAD dummy is one you can't clearly see how the declarer is going to use it. It's usually balanced with no obvious source of tricks. We don't want to break any new suits if we can help it. Rather, we want to maybe lead trumps or lead a suit where they already have tricks. Go passive!! |
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


mb|1dp1s?|nt||lb|*bYour bid please.^^x|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|With 14 pts and four cards in each unbid suit, we have to get in the act.|mb|x|
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


mb|p|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|This pass is much more interesting than it looks. Responder named a new suit, and opener normally would have to bid again. BUT! The double ensures that his partner will get to bid again. The pass also strongly suggests that opener has a minimum hand and is 5-3-3-2. If he had a four card suit, he'd name it; if he had more points, he'd find a bid. Like we said. Interesting.|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


mb|2h|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Pard has a gun to his head, and must bid even if he doesn't feel well. He could have 0 pts., no more than 7-8ish.|
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


mb|4s|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|East has enough cash to go to game over a minimal opener. And he loves his Spades. He should have an independent suit, one he doesn't mind playing opposite a singleton.|

pc|hahjh4|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|We make a natural lead and note pard's lack of support. We get ready for our defender's Count and Plan. How many points does partner have? How many tricks can we see? How might we set the contract? What strategy should we employ? (So many questions, so little time.) |
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With declarer/dummy having 25ish points (the jump to game by East suggests a distributional hand, so he might have points derived from shape) and us having 14, pard cannot have much. We can see three tricks in our hand.|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We look at dummy, and see five tricks for the declarer because of our holding the @DK and a place to dump losers from this hand and the next. If pard has points in Spades, they are toast. We need to attack.|

pc|c4c9|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|The lead of an ace at trick one promises the leader is also holding the king. The lead of an ace later in the hand can show the king, but it's more important meaning is "Partner, do YOU happen to hold the king?" When we lead the @CA at trick 2, and pard plays the @C9, pard is standing on his chair hollering, "YES I have the king!"|

nt||up|15|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|After an interesting auction, we lead our @HA and after seeing the dummy and partner's discouraging card, we start thinking. Our Count and Plan involves counting the points in partner's hand, "looking at the dummy, Dummy," counting our sure tricks and coming up with a way to set the contract. |
PG| ***** 175 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We know partner is close to broke. And while we see three tricks in our hand, we don't have a lot of hope. We will do all the right things though, in hopes of finding the fourth trick somewhere. |
PG| ***** 176 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The dummy's long Diamonds call for an attacking defense. We aren't going to play a second round of Hearts (save it for dessert). The only real hope we have is the Clubs. |
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


NT|^B@2

At trick 2, we lead our @cA. The lead of an Ace in mid-hand asks partner "Do you have the King?" We don't have high hopes, but miracle of miracles, Pard plays the @c9. And at trick 3, we lead to his @cK, followed by his returning our original lead, and the setting trick falls to our @HK. |
PG| ***** 178 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It doesn't really take a genius to switch to the Club, but our goal is to get your thinking about defense strategy on track. Good things happen to people who do things good. Go team!|

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Well, there's not much information you can gather from dummy. You can see that declarer isn't going to get very far in playing on Clubs but that's about all.|
PG| ***** 183 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
You do know that declarer-dummy must have 26 to 28 points between them. You also know that partner has led his longest and strongest suit and you have useful honor cards in support. This must be good news.|

PG| ***** 188 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The answer, of course, comes from the play at trick one. When North saw your @SJ force the @SA you simply had to have the @SQ.|
PG| ***** 189 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
If declarer held the Queen he has made a bizarre play of taking trick one with the Ace when holding @SA Q. Why would anyone sane do that?|

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|East-West bid rapidly 1NT - 3NT. West, the opener, has 16 points and is 5-3-3-2, East has 11 points and is 4-4-3-2.|
PG| ***** 198 ***** |


NT|^B@2
North, our partner, leads his fourth-best Spade, the @S6. Dummy plays low and we should play the...? |
PG| ***** 199 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We must play the @SJ. When we are in third seat with equal cards ^*Bwe must play the lower of two touching honors^*N. |
PG| ***** 200 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You might not think it makes an ounce of difference as the Queen and Jack have the same value but - oh! - it matters all right. In fact, it is crucial.|
PG| ***** 201 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now, for a moment, look at things from North's perspective. If North sees us play the Queen and declarer the Ace he wouldn't know the whereabouts of the @SJ (for all he knows, declarer could have @SA J x). |
PG| ***** 202 ***** |


NT|^B@2
He would suspect that he could not lead Spades again without giving West a cheap trick in the suit - and that would be a fatal misjudgement on this hand. North should not blame himself - the fault would be ours.|
PG| ***** 203 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now let's revert to the South seat. If we correctly play the @SJ and declarer the Ace, partner can deduce that we must have the Queen. Why? Because if declarer had that card he would have won the trick with it. (Why would declarer take the @SJ with the @SA had he held @SA Q x? Simply put: he wouldn't).|
PG| ***** 204 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So remember - when playing as third hand with equal cards, play the lower of touching honors. (Hand 1 has a similar theme).|
PG| ***** 205 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Back to the play - declarer takes our @SJ with the @SA and leads a low Diamond. Partner, knowing that we hold the @SQ, takes his @DA immediately and continues Spades to take the contract one off before it gets started.|
PG| ***** 206 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Partner is quite entitled to play the @DA "on air" here - he can see that our side has five tricks to take.|
