^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I like the 2@S bid, particularly with the weak 3-card spade support. The other alternative would be 2@C, limit raise, but that has 2 things which make it less desirable a) weak 3-card support and b) dubious doubleton in diamonds.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not sure how EW do in 3@S. They have 4 obvious losers. One in each suit. But they have to maneuver a diamond ruff in the east hand which may not work out.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Plus they have to lead spades twice from east and clubs once. Not to mention I am giving north a club ruff. So pass by west was probably fine.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand does illustrate one other interesting point that many players, including some good ones, don't realize. Our 6-1 club fit with my nice clubs, is actually probably a better contract than our 5-3 diamond fit and safer.|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A nice 6-card suit with 4 honors is called a "self-sufficient" suit. Meaning with normal breaks, even if partner has a singleton, you will only lose 1 trick at most.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is rarely wrong when you have such a suit for it to be trump. So when you have a self-sufficient suit, especially a major, it should be trump almost all the time.|

pg| ***** 31 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good question. Partner is a passed hand. Although in this case it doesn't matter, I play it is forcing. But most play it non-forcing (incorrectly IMO). |
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Semi-forcing would be ok. That means opener can pass with 5-3-3-2 and 12-14. In short I think playing it non-forcing is not a good idea.|
pg| ***** 33 ***** |


mb|P|mb|4S|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@S is a reasonable bid. West almost has a self sufficient suit. Even if partner has a small singleton, more often than not he will lose only 1 trick (spades are 3-3 or the 10 is doubleton).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss what to lead from 3 small. The heart lead is fine. But IMO those who play "MUD" (middle up down) are incorrect. It's sort of the worst of both worlds. Partner has no idea how many you have or whether or not you have an honor.|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have a slight preference for count (so low for 3 small) but top of nothing is fine also. MUD is a really bad idea.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I like the bidding and I would have made the same lead. It turns out if partner leads the @DK we beat it one trick.

pg| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us assume you have established the trump suit, ready to determine how many Key Cards your partnership has, and you have a void in a suit. First, because of void, there are only four Key Cards (the other 3 Aces and the King of trump)or three aces if you play regular Blackwood. A jump bid (a bid above the game) in the suit you have a void is EKB.|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


NT||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The jump bid is usually 5@C, 5@D, 5@H, or 4@D if the trump suit is a major. So here my 5@D is EKC for diamond telling partner that I am void in diamonds.|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In responding to EKC, my 5@D here, partner does not count the @DA if he/she has it. It should be alerted. Further, partner can use the scheme of RKCB 1430 or 0314. I prefer and suggest RKCB 0314. |mb|5d|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next I will illustrate the partner's response to my 5@D EKC based on number of keycard partner is holding. Again I announced that I am void in diamonds and partner should ignore the ace of diamonds.|mb|p|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good question. Sort of but not exactly. The best diamond holdings are 3 or 4 small or 3 or 4 to the ace.With @DAK the @DK is worth something as a discard. With @DAQ or @DKQ it should be devaluted. I would say DAK is ok although worse than having the king somewhere else (like in hearts).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A lot of players would open light in 3rd seat. But I am not a big fan of light 1-level openers in 3rd seat because I feel it makes it hard for partner to know when to try for game. I love to preempt in 3rd seat, but not open light at the 1-level.|mb|P|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You could play what is known as "unusual over unusual".  You have cue bids of 3@C and 3@D available since North has shown both those suits.

I suggest you study my lesson  |CP|1|fp|2|AT|^*g:UNT_Defense::Competitive Bidding, UNT_Defense (link stays inside aaBridge)^*n|CP||fp||at|  for a complete understanding.|

^B@2^*bRPf: ^*n|cp||at| No other, details, information or commentary on this hand were provided by the up stream author (Kia).

So for the curious, I have found the rest of the hand from out of the archives (which Kia kindly does provides).|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|With East holding six hearts to West's one, there is a good chance that East will hold a singleton spade. (If spades break 3-2, you are certain to score the three spade tricks that you need anyway). By playing the @SA first, you will succeed when East's singleton spade is the @SQ, @S10 or @S9.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|The only remaining distribution of the spade suit that can defeat you is that West began with @SQ 10 6 2. You cope with this by finessing dummy's @S7. If the finesse loses, spades will have broken 3-2 and the contract will be yours.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|Showing respect for his partner's 2@H bid, West leads the @H2 against 6NT. How would you tackle the small slam? You have ten top tricks and must therefore create two extra tricks from the black suits. |
pg| ***** 153 ***** |


NT|^B@2
To give yourself the best chance, you should take the club finesse before playing spades. That's because the best play in spades depends on whether you have an extra trick from the club suit. |
pg| ***** 154 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You win the heart lead in dummy and finesse the @CJ. The finesse wins (which was no certainty, with some players willing to open a weak-two on a 3-count nowadays). You therefore need to look for a safety play in spades that will give you the best chance of three tricks. How would you play the suit? |
pg| ***** 155 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You should cash the @SA on the first round. Nothing is lost if East began with three or four spades to the queen, because you can lead towards the @SJ later. The advantage comes when East holds a singleton @S10 or @S9. You continue with a second round of spades towards dummy, planning to cover West's card. |
pg| ***** 156 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West plays the @S6 and you cover with the @S7, giving you the three spade tricks that you need. If West were to play the @S10, of course, you would win and lose just one trick to the @SQ.|
pg| ***** 157 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Go back to trick two. If the club finesse were to lose, you would play spades in the normal way, finessing East for the queen and hoping to score all four spade tricks. |
