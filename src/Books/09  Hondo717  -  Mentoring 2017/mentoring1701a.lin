^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 1@S overcall has merit. It is a good idea to lay claim to spades when you can. But since East has mediocre spades, 3 quacks, and a dubious diamond doubleton, pass would be OK as well.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


NT|^B@2
onenoDavid:  3 quacks ?|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|"Quacks" are a derisive term for queens and jacks. Experts are not fond of queens and jacks. Their value is overrated using the standard 4-3-2-1 HCP system.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


mb|d|mb|2S|mb|3H|sk|s|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Note that the 1@C bid followed by the 2@S overcall made it harder for North/South to bid. Now South is not sure exactly how many points North has. If East had passed South would have bid 1@H and North would have raised to 2@H, showing a min opener. But once West bids 2@S, 2@H is no longer available so the 3@H bid is not as precise.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


mb|p|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me count South's dummy points. But first let me deal with @SK. Note that the @SK is more likely to be valuable given the 1S overcall. Why? Because even if North/South are missing the @SA, it is more likely to be in the East hand meaning the @SK is likely to take a trick.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


NT|^B@2
so 10 HCP, 1 length point (5 diamonds), 1 quality suit point for 12 starting points. Once hearts are raised I can add 3 for the singleton with 4-card support (although it is a little worrisome that partner bid clubs, my singleton).|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Anyway, 12 starting points + 3 dummy points means I have a clear 4@H bid.|mb|4H|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general North took a good line on the spade lead. Outside of trump, North can count 5 tricks for sure--3 spades, 1 diamond and 1 club. Five more tricks are needed. If the @HA is onside and hearts are 3-2, there are 4 trump tricks--3 by length and 2 by cross ruffing. So one more trick is need.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT|^B@2
if West has the @CA, it will be hard to duck. That will give an extra club trick. If that doesn't work, then the @DQ might provide an extra trick.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Leading a trump by West was fine. East should probably win the @HA and lead another heart. Leading the @DJ, with @DQ10xxx in dummy does not rate to work out.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The standard bid here for South is 1@D, with 4 diamonds and 4 clubs. But I like opening 1@C with this hand when I intend to rebid 2N. why? Because it makes it more likely that I will be able to bid NT first, and I would prefer to be declarer with my strong hand.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If I open 1@D and responder has no 4-card major, he will often bid 1N and North would play 3N. On the other hand, if I open 1@C, even without a 4-card major, partner may be able to bid 1@D. So opening 1@C makes it more likely I will get to bid 2N and be declarer.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But if you chose to open 1@D, that is officially the correct bid. I also could open 2N if I wanted to upgrade the hand due to 4 aces. But I don't tend to like to do that.|mb|1C|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would have bid 3@S with the East hand, based on LOTT. But given the unfavorable vul and flat hand, pass is probably what most players would choose.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a rare hand where 5@D is the better contract, but maybe not. Actually 5@D needs a 2-2 diamond break. 3NT needs the club finesse, which is 50%. It's actually better than 50% based on the bidding since West rates to be short in clubs meaning it is more likely than 50% that East has the @CQ.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |

princesess: What should be the bid by North had West passed? 1@D or 1@H?|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is my rule about choosing 1@D vs 1@H or 1@S after partner opens 1@C. If I have a minimum response such that I am likely to pass a minimum rebid by opener then I bid the major.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So on this hand with North having only 7 HCP, I would bid 1@H. On the other hand, if North were stronger say 11+ then 1@D would be better because he would then have enough strength to make a 2nd bid if need be.|

PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I can get a club trick if the @CA might be onside and I might get 2 or 3 hearts. Also, look at the opening lead--@D8. If it's 4th best (not clear), we can use the rule of 11. 11 - 8 (for the @D8) is 3. So if that lead is 4th best, East has no diamonds higher than the 8. And I have the three and a free entry to dummy.|

On the other hand, in this board, it turns out the lead directing double is not going to work out this hand because a spade lead would have worked better. But that does not mean the double was wrong, just unlucky.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it turns out, 3N even makes on a spade lead because the heart finesse works. In fact, it makes 4, because hearts are 3-3 but on this hand East can't afford to take the heart finesse since if it loses, 3N might go down.|
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Some kibs asked if West could bid 3N. On some 9 points hands with a 5-card suit, that would be reasonable. I wouldn't say 3N by West is crazy, but I think it is a slight overbid because the diamonds are long but weak.|
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If, for example, West had a hand with 9 HCP and a nice diamond suit like KQ10xx, then 3N would be more reasonable. But on this hand I do think 2N is best.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West cannot bid 4@D because it is a slam try showing a diamond control. East/West have agreed on spades. Also, the argument that West is trying to find another fit by bidding 4@D is not appropriate. |
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You don't get extra points for finding a different fit, especially a minor over a major. So any bids other than spades are slam tries because East/West have already agreed to play in spades.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is not really logical because if 4@D did not force to 4@S then it might be a help suit game try. But since 4@D forces to 4@S it must be a slam try. You can only make a help suit game try if you can stop below game.|

NT|^B@2
Some experts play what is called a "maximal" double by West in this auction. If you play that, then double by West is a game try and 3@S is just competing. Let us undo the bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good play. Tough hand. I like the 3@S bid there with the 5-5 distribution and singleton heart. Some kibs were concerned that West "only had 9 points." But West has a much nice hand than many hands with more HCP. HCP are only a part of how you evaluate your hand. Good distribution often plays a more important role.|

NT|^B@2
Flat hands are generally weaker than their HCP indicate. Experts much prefer to have distributional hands to hands with lots of high cards.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is another hand (South hand) where distribution is very important. Why did I bid 4@H rather than Michaels? Because there are very few hands where 4@S plays better than 4@H.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West should double here. Double by West is not pure penalty. It is "card showing" or a "do something intelligent" double. Then on this hand, East should pass the double since has no better bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another good example of the power of distribution. I only had 5 HCP and partner had 8 HCP and we are only down 1 in 4@H with 13 HCP. I strongly urge you to use Bergen Hand Evaluation when figuring out how good your hand is. That takes into account both HCP and distribution as well as where your honors are placed. |

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|This is a trivial contract that you reach. However when playing in a moron-proof contract you mustn't relax and just take your top tricks - can you make what might be an all-important overtrick? Remember the Matchpoint-pairs scoring method! |
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Yes, this is the easiest hand you've ever seen on VuBridge - you could throw the cards against the wall and play them as they fall and you couldn't go off in 4@H.|
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
HOWEVER... 
This is Matchpoints-pairs. 4@H making on the nose will be a poor score if everyone else is making 4@H+1.
 
Of course, the @CA might be on your right, in which case an overtrick will fall into your lap. Do you think that is very likely...?|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|You have made two Heart tricks and that, to all intents and purposes, ends the interest in this deal. You have all the remaining tricks except for the last Heart - which you will concede at a point of your own choosing.|
PG| ***** 205 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Sure, West could have taken his King had he wanted to, but that would only have altered the timing of when you won the Queen.|up|36|
PG| ***** 206 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Now... let's analyze this Heart layout. Many players make the mistake of leading the @HQ from dummy, hoping to let it ride. That would be poor play. It's not a genuine finesse, it's a pseudo-finesse.|
PG| ***** 207 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Did someone say, "Why not lead the Queen and let it ride?" Well, if East did hold the @HK (and had played the game before) he would take out two of your honors for one of his side's by putting the @HK on it.|
PG| ***** 208 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Spend a few seconds thinking about what would happen then... You would lose the @HQ and the @HA on the same trick, being left with two small Hearts facing two small Hearts. No chance of a further trick there.|
PG| ***** 209 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
The correct play is to cash the @HA and lead toward the @HQ through West (whom you hope has the King). Remember, toward your wish card.|
PG| ***** 210 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Why play the @HA first before the finesse? Folks, sometimes a miracle occurs and you drop a singleton King. Sure, it's a 1% shot, but it costs you nothing and is a good habit to develop.|
PG| ***** 211 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
There's one more point... You should have known that West held the @HK. East couldn't hold it if the bidding is to be believed. The clues are there, Watson, can you make use of them?|
pg| ***** 212 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The analysis is correct as far as it goes. Your main hope is that the @HK is onside (e.g. in the West hand). And that is very likely because East has already shown up with the @DA, @DK, and @DQ and probably would have opened if he also had the @HK. |
PG| ***** 213 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However an expert would have given himself a small additional chance. Before playing hearts, he would have cashed 3 club tricks. That way, if the @HK happened to be in the East hand but it was doubleton.|
PG| ***** 214 ***** |


NT|^B@2
 East would be end played because he would have to lead a club or a diamond back, giving declarer a ruff/sluff so he could pitch a heart loser in one hand while ruffing in the other hand. Unlikely, but it is costless to cash the clubs first before playing hearts. You should always give yourself extra chances when you can.|
