nt|^z@3^a|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When you bid over a weak 2, you should have opening values. I am just short (10 adjust HCP + 9 cards = 19 for the rule of 20). But I chose to bid anyway. North's bid was fine although it was also a bit pushy with only 10 HCP. However, the 4th. spade made it the best bid.|

mb|P|mb|2N|nt|^z@3^a|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now normally I would bid 2@S with a 6-card suit but I decided to make an exception here because my suit is pretty bad and I have most of my values in the minors. I felt 2NT was a better bid because I don't really want to play in 4@S opposite a small doubleton or even a doubleton honor.|

PG| ***** 17 ***** |


nt|^z@3^a|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I could set up spades or hearts. Either is fine. But by playing spades first I have set up an 8th trick. I need to be careful about entries and unblocking clubs.|

mb|P?|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are 2 things to consider regarding preempting on this hand. a) favorable vulnerability (you not vul, they vul) is the best time to preempt and b) the position--second seat is not good. An expression many pros use is WARIB ("White Against Red Isn't Bridge").|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


nt|^z@3^a|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In the old days on duplicate boards if your tray was red you were vulnerable (and that still is true more or less, although now the labels are red). And if you were not vulnerable the tray was white. So "white" means not vul and "red" means vul--hence WARIB.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|^z@3^a|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You should be very frisky with your preempts at favorable vul. However, there is another consideration and that is, 2nd seat is the worst seat to preempt. Because the 1st person has passed, therefore, they can't have too strong a hand. That means partner is more likely to have a good hand.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|^z@3^a|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And when you preempt in 2nd seat, you could be preempting partner taking up valuable bidding room if partner has a good hand. That does not mean you should never preempt in 2nd seat. It just means you should not make a marginal preempt.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


nt|^z@3^a|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand I have 2 competing theories. I am at favorable vul but I am in 2nd seat. Having said that, weak 2s in particular, since I play Ogust are pretty descriptive. Thus I am going to open 2@S because of my 6-3-3-1 distribution and nice spade intermediate cards (@s10 9 8).|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


nt|^z@3^a|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I had the same high cards but was 6-3-2-2 I probably would not preempt in 2nd seat. A singleton makes a big difference when deciding whether or not to preempt.|mb|2S|

^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*nThis board is from my table hopping at BBO when trying to kib experts' tables. 

You are sitting South playing with three top experts. You need to make an opening lead and afterward Howard will discuss whether you have done well or you need more bridge lessons. 

For now please ignore the bidding. We will get to that later.|

AT|^^^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|When leading against a grand slam (or 6NT), you should strive to make a neutral lead. With the South hand, the most neutral leads are in hearts and clubs. Regarding spades, leading from a suit headed by jack-third is very risky and will often give away a trick. |
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


nt|^z@3^a|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|And leading a doubleton, although somewhat neutral, is more risky than leading for a longer suit with no honors. That is because if both partner and declarer might have length in the suit and therefore it is more likely that you might help declarer pick up the suit.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


nt|^z@3^a|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Why should you choose a club? Because you have no high cards in that suit. Further, because you have the @H10, there is some possibility that a heart might give away a trick. So a club seems safer and I would, if I were sitting south, chose the @C8, top of nothing in NT contract.|pc|C8ct|

pc|c3|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Your partner saved you and me. That play is an expert play. Had he played the @CJ, the @C8 opening lead would have been fatal for the defense. Let us look at the four hand so I can better explain.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


sk||nt|^z@3^a|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|had your partner not made the expert play of ducking his @CJ, that lead would have been fatal for the defense. If he covers the @C9 with his @CJ, then declarer can take 4 spade tricks, 3 heart tricks, 2 diamond tricks, and 4 club tricks and make 7NT.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


nt|^z@3^a|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|How did partner know to duck? Because covering gains nothing. My @C8 was clearly top of nothing. Therefore declarer was known to have the @CQ. If it turns out declarer has 2 or more clubs to the @CQ, then covering doesn't matter. |
pg| ***** 66 ***** |


nt|^z@3^a|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But if you happen to have 4 clubs, as you did, then declarer has the singleton queen and not covering means declarer can only take 3 club tricks.|pc|CQ|
pg| ***** 67 ***** |


nt|^z@3^a|at|^^^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*n Next we have Howard's comment on the biding.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


nt|^z@3^a|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|East has a clear 2@C opener. On the other hand, 2N rebid with a singleton @CQ obviously is very imperfect. However, he has no better alternative rebid since bidding a suit shows a 5+-card suit.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


nt|^z@3^a|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Let's count West's points after the 2N rebid by East, showing 22-24. Using Bergen Hand Evaluation, he has 12 HCP and 1 quality suit point, for a total of 13. That means his side has somewhere between 35 and 37 points. To bid a grand slam, you need at least 37 points.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


nt|^z@3^a|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|West also should only bid a grand slam if he can count 13 tricks. So West should not consider bidding a grand slam. He should simply bid 6NT. Although he could bid Gerber on the way to 6N, it really is not necessary. Since the combined HCP total for East-West is at least 34, it is not possible for their side to be missing 2 aces.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


nt|^z@3^a|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|Let's do a plan for declarer. He has 11 top tricks -- 3 spades, 3 hearts, 2 diamonds, and 3 clubs. There are 3 possibilities for West to score a 12th. trick. They are 1) the diamond finesse 2) a 3-2 diamond break and 3) the SJ dropping in 3 or fewer rounds. So declarer would have to be very unlucky in order not to take 12 tricks.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


nt|^z@3^a|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*BHoward: ^*N|cp||at|13 tricks are much iffier. In that case, declarer definitely needs the diamond finesse. Once that works, he then needs either a 3-2 diamond break or the @SJ dropping in 3 or fewer rounds. So the grand slam is a little less than 50%. If the diamond finesse works (50%), one of the other two possibilities is fairly likely.|

pg| ***** 124 ***** |


nt|^z@3^a|hs|sd|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you open 3NT, you are showing a running minor suit, 7 or 8 cards headed by the AKQ and you have no other outside aces or kings. It's sort of a way of preempting in a minor combined with letting your side play 3NT when possible.|
pg| ***** 125 ***** |


nt|^z@3^a|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If partner opens a gambling 3NT you pass if you have stoppers in 3 suits (it will be obvious what partner's minor is because you won't have a stopper). Otherwise you bid 4@C and let partner pass with clubs or correct to diamonds.|
pg| ***** 126 ***** |


nt|^z@3^a|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Rarely responder might have a hand where he wants to play in 5@C or 5@D in which case responder bids 5@C. But 95% of the time you either pass or bid 4@C.|
pg| ***** 127 ***** |


mb|p|nt|^z@3^a|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here I don't have any minor suit stoppers and I know one minor suit is running for the opponents. Therefore, I have to pull. Next partner will correct to 4@D.|mb|4c|

A kib: But they have 3 suite to choose the lead from. Do you ever gamble that they will lead wrong?|
pg| ***** 131 ***** |


nt|^z@3^a|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Those experienced against gambling 3N will lead aces if they have them just to see what is going on. So it is possible they will lead wrong (as they might on this hand) but often they will find the right lead. For example if the East/West hands were reversed the club lead is obvious.|
