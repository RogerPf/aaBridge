^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Should East consider game?|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


AT| Ignoring the @SJ, East has 12 HCP. And over a weak 2, the overcaller needs at least a good opener. Therefore, East's side has game. The question is, can they make 3NT because 3NT is normally a better game than 5@C or 5@D.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |

lcmdir: I could bid 3@S as asking.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You could but it's not 100% clear. Note that 3@S is NOT a limit raise. Although a cue bid by responder is usually a limit raise, in this case, there is no point because East/West is forced to 4@H over 3@S in any case. |
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So 3@S is one of the following:
a) a try for 3N (more likely),  or 
b) a slam try.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well done. First of all, it's good to remember that you should almost always prefer to play 3NT to 5 of a minor. If there is any chance your side should be in 3NT, try not to go past 3NT. And, as is the case "more often than not", 3NT is the better contract on this hand.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, East should play the @SJ rather than low. Based on the lead and the bidding, West knows I have the @SQ10. So West is always winning 3 spade tricks. But by playing the @SJ, the suit is unblocked and she can get to her hand in spades to take her 3rd spade without wasting an entry in another suit.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And, given she decided to try and set up hearts, that extra entry is probably crucial. Setting up hearts is reasonable, although a bit risky.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |

bjmue: Did you give me 3 spade tricks? I thought i only would get two.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, you can count 3 spade tricks, based on the lead and the auction. You have @AK9 and you know I have @SQ10. So, as long as you play the @SJ at trick 1 and finesse the 9 on the 2nd spade trick you have 3 spade tricks.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Anyway, West has 3 spades, 2 diamonds, 1 club, 1 heart for sure, and needs 2 more tricks. Choices are to try for extra tricks in clubs or in hearts. Hearts is reasonable. It is easy enough to set up 1 extra heart trick because playing a heart to the @HA and then the @HQ will set up the heart jack.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once the @H10 comes down on the first round, everything is looking good. But even if it doesn't the @H10 might come down in 3 rounds or there might be an extra diamond trick if diamonds are 3-2.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@D is a reasonable bid, even if playing 2 over 1 (and not playing Drury). North can't have a game forcing hand (even if playing 2 over 1) since North did not open. So once North did not open we can revert to normal SAYC type bidding.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |

kirby2: Should I bid just 2@S instead of 2@D?|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No 2@S is not strong enough.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But 2@D is passable, although it is not likely to be passed particularly since it is possible that North has a 3-card limit raise. Assuming we are not playing Drury, I think 2@D is a reasonable bid. However, let me discuss why I play 1NT forcing even by a passed hand.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First of all, responder might have the 3-card limit raise and, in general, playing 1NT forcing gives responder more flexibility to describe the hand even by a passed hand. So I prefer 1NT forcing, or at least semi-forcing (meaning opener doesn't pass unless they have 5-3-3-2 and 12-13).|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


mb|P|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now the question is, should I bid over 2@D. Let me count my Dummy Points. I have  12 HCP, 1 length point, and  1 for doubleton for 14 Dummy points. However, since partner is a passed hand and we are not going to be 5@D I would only count 13 dummy points here.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, partner can't have 4 spades and should have 5 diamonds. Therefore, I am going to pass in IMPs. In Match Points I might bid 3@D in case partner has the 3-card limit raise in spades. But in IMPS a 5-3 diamond fit is the same as a 5-3 spade fit. Besides, a) 2@D is lower than 3@D or 3@S and b) partner might have 6 diamonds (although in that case he should have opened a weak 2).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A couple of things to remember.
First, very important, don't ruff in the long hand unless you have a good reason (perhaps you need an entry) all it does is shorten your trump. And if you get a bad trump break, that could prove to be a problem. Remember, ruffing in the long hand does not generate any extra tricks.|
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Second, North should realize she needs to ruff 1 heart loser. So she should start immediately on hearts at trick 2 before drawing any trump.|
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One of the first things you need to decide as declarer is should you draw trump or not. Sometimes you do, but often you don't. I would say you draw trump immediately on half the hands or maybe a bit more. And the most common reason not to draw trump is because you need to ruff in dummy. In this case, North knows she needs to ruff a heart.|
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Unlike ruffing in the long hand, ruffing in the short hand does generate an extra trick. Therefore, if you can generate a ruff in the short hand, don't draw trump.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The East hand is a minimum, with only 12 HCP. So pass would be reasonable. Normally jacks are overvalued. But in this case, because of the auction, both the @HJ and the @CJ have value. And East does have a reasonably nice 6-card suit. So I would bid 3NT.|mb|3N|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because the heart suit is blocked, the defense will likely duck the heart jack. And the only sure entry back is the @SK. However, it is possible that the defense will put West back in her hand with a club or a heart, so setting up hearts is still likely to be the best plan.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good try by West. Although she managed to set up 9 tricks, she ended up losing the race because the defense was able to take 5 tricks before she could take 9 tricks. Had the Diamond finesse worked, she might have made 3NT. But on the actual layout, 3NT is very difficult to make.|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Ruffing (high, low or with the @S9) is futile and unnecessary. East has played high-low in diamonds so that (and the bidding) makes it clear that the suit is 6-2. To all but guarantee the contract all you have to do is pitch a club from table.|
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
What next? West leads something and you can draw trumps (assuming they aren't 4-0) and can ruff a club in the dummy for your tenth trick.|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|This hand has been played many times since it first turned up in a pairs contest.|
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


NT|^B@2
South usually arrives in 4@S after West overcalls in Diamonds and the normal start to the defense is for West to play off three rounds of Diamonds, responding to his partner's high-low signal in the suit. Now what do you do as South at trick three?|
PG| ***** 140 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you ruff in dummy with the @S9 East will over-ruff with the @SJ and you have an inevitable Club loser. Perhaps it's better to ruff high (with the @SQ) then? Well, you can try the effect of that but you have an inescapable trump loser when Spades prove to be 3-1 and you still have that Club loser at the end of the hand.|
PG| ***** 141 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So you may claim that 4@S can't make after West plays three rounds of Diamonds? Wrong! There is no need for declarer to ruff the third Diamond at all. |
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This hand is a classic loser-on-loser play - all South has to do is to throw a Club away from dummy on the third Diamond, allowing West the temporary pleasure of making the @DQ.|
PG| ***** 143 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now what can the defenders do? Any subsequent lead by West can be gobbled up, trumps drawn in three rounds and a Club ruffed on table. Declarer makes five Spades, two Hearts, two Clubs and a Club ruff in dummy for a total of ten. It's a sort of easy-when-you-see-it deal.|
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In the Lords v Commons match what happened? Well, three declarers made ten tricks in spades on this hand. Unfortunately, one was only in 3@S so the overtrick was of little importance at this table. Two recorded 4@S making and one was defeated. 270 to the House of Lords.|
