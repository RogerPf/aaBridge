nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, after losing the @DK, if a spade comes back, West is in danger of losing at least 3 spades, 1 diamond, and 1 heart for down 1. The only hope is that spades are 5-3 and the person with the @HA is the one with 3 spades.|

mb|2D|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East should not bid 1N. That shows a moderate hand 8-10 or so. East should either pass (but not on this hand) or bid her best suit. East's bidding her best suit does NOT promise any values. It is simply a preference.|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Given South has an opener, North has 10, and West has an opener (or close), it is obvious that East can't have much. So East is free to bid with even 0 points.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No need for West to let partner know about diamonds. East already said she had diamonds with the takeout double which, as I already mentioned, is why East should lead a diamond.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I know many teachers say leading an unbid major is a good lead in NT, even if you are short. But my recommendation is to lead your longest and strongest suit that was not bid by the opponents.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, I don't see why, even if partner has the @SA a spade lead helps. With East diamond holding, East doesn't need a lead through North. If East had @DAQ then maybe a spade makes sense. But with Jxxx of diamonds a diamond lead should not give away a trick.|

UP|20|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the 2 things to learn from this hand are a) fast arrival - jumping to game in a game force auction is weaker than not jumping and b) how to do a queen ask with Roman Keycard.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some people will not open a Weak Twos with a 4-card major but there really is no reason to worry about that. Once in a great while, when you have diamonds you might miss a spade contract.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But you can't worry about that. It rarely happens and diamonds is often still the better contract even with a 4-4 spade fit. Further, as you can see, it makes it harder for me to bid. Any time you can preempt you should.|
