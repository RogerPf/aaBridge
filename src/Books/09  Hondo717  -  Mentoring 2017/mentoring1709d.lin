UP|52|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's first discuss the bidding. I think west should bid 2@H over 1@S. That shows a strong hand with 5+ clubs and 4 hearts (or rarely 5).|
pg| ***** 34 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to how we do in 3@S, it depends on the lead. The choices for west are the @CA or the @SA. With the @SA lead, I will be hard pressed to come to 9 tricks. I have 4 spades by length, + 1 heart, plus 2 heart ruffs in dummy. That's 7. So passing worked out best.|
pg| ***** 35 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In Match Points I might consider doubling. More so if they were vul because then down 1 for +200 is a great score. When playing match points, you should make close doubles when the opponents are vul. Because setting them 1 for +200 is usually a top.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Were west not a passed hand, I think east needs to take a bid for sure. I would double. The small doubleton club is worrisome. But I would double and bid 4@D if partner bids 4@C and they end up in 4@D or maybe 5.|

mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|2S|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As far as the 2@S bid by east goes that is not what I would have chosen. East has 2 choices of bids. 3@S which is a preemptive jump raise, showing less than a limit raise with 4 card support or to bid 3@D. 3@D a cue bid showing a limit raise is my choice. But that is a bit pushy. East has 9 points--7 HCP, 1 doubleton, and 1 for quality club suit.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So 3@D is a bit of an overbid, and 3@S a bit of an underbid. But 2@S is a big underbid. On the other hand, the 4th spade is very nice, worth a point perhaps and the intermediate spades are nice making 3@D an okay bid. BTW, I think west should pass 2@S. But then east could and should make a LOTT bid of 3@S and they end up there anyway.|

mb|3D|NT||mb|3S|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 3@S bid is NOT invitational. It is simply competing and east cannot bid 4@S If west wanted to try for game, she could bid 3@H.|

mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In Match Points, I probably bid 4@D but in IMPs it's not worth the risk that they make 4@S.|

PG| ***** 70 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It's really a LOTT consideration.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Based on my guidelines for bidding 3 over 3, you should only bid "3 over 3" if a) you have a 9-card fit or b) you have a singleton. On occasion, with a nice 16 or 17, I might bid 3 over 3 even if I don't meet my criteria.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Using Bergen hand evaluation the west hand is worth 15 Bergen Points. That's a little better than a min opener. But not much. Flat hands are never as good as they look and should be downgraded. |
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, my hand screams for offense. I have 2 aces and a singleton in opponent's suit.I have 12 or 13 dummy points. So perhaps I should bid 4@D. It's not that I am worried about going down too many in 4@D. It's that I am worried about pushing them into 4@S. It's hard to say what is right.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In IMPs, my decision to pass worked out ok since +100 and +130 are the same. But in Match Points, as I said, I think I should bid 4@D.|

The reason being north has an easy rebid of 1NT if I respond 1@H or 1@S.|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The only reason to open 1@D with 4 diamonds and 5 clubs is, say you have a singleton major and it goes 
1@C - P - 1@S (your singleton).   
Then if you don't like rebidding 2@C without a 6-card suit. But if you open 1@D you have a 2@C rebid.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|that is why some people open 1@D when they have 4 diamonds and 5 clubs. On this hand a) your diamonds are really terrible and b) you can rebid 1NT over 1@H or 1@S. So there is absolutely no reason to open 1@D.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And having said all that, I still disagree with opening 1@D when you are 4-5 in the minors. If you do that, then partner never knows when to go back to diamonds or leave you in clubs because partner has no idea what your distribution is in the minors. Therefore, I never open 1@D with 4 diamonds and 5 clubs.|

pg| ***** 96 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The spade finesse rates to work since I bid 1@S. So it comes down to picking up the heart suit for 1 loser which is probably a little less than 50%. The best play in hearts is to lead low to the @HK and then lead low and play low (or the @H10) when I play low.|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|A bridge player was once overheard threatening her novice partner, "If you ever pass my Takeout Double again, they'll find your body in the Pine Barrens!" (The Pine Barrens are an area of New Jersey where they think Jimmy Hoffa is buried.) |

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|There is however an exception. When you find yourself behind the declarer with a Sears Tower skyscraper stack of trumps. And that's what this hand is all about. We already bid it, but we'll do it again. |
pg| ***** 103 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|You are the person who passes the double, so you better produce or we'll need the cadaver dogs! |
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


mb|1d|NT||lb|*bYour bid please.^^p|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|A Pass in the Overcall suit doesn't mean "I don't have anything," it means, "I don't have a bid." You can't make a Takeout Double. You can't overcall. When you have the opponents' suit, your best bet is to look your most innocent and inattentive and just pass.|mb|p|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Pard's re-opening double shows 9-ish points and is done to protect partner's points. The bidding shows that there are points in your partner's hand. Your job is to protect Pard's partner's points. Usually.|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|People have been shot for passing pard's takeout double, but events will prove you right. You are behind the declarer, with at least four tricks in his suit, plus well-placed kings. The declarer is toast.|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|We hope to reach partner. We know we've got four trump tricks and now that we've seen the dummy, we like our black kings even more. Surely we can count on partner for something? How many points does he have?|
pg| ***** 113 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|If declarer has an opening 12-14ish, dummy has 3 and we have 13, that leaves 10-11 for Pard. Hmmm. Let's see what happens.|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|After a very interesting, and almost never seen, auction, we find ourselves defending a 1@D doubled contract. We need  seven tricks to set them, and we end up taking eight. |
pg| ***** 134 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Some considerations for this death-defying move. You should be behind the declarer with at least 4-5 tricks in trumps and some other "stuff." On this hand, we have exactly the Empire State Building we need. |
pg| ***** 135 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Partner has a role to play at trick 2. When he is on lead, his job is to lead trumps even if he has to steal one. Fortunately he didn't have to resort to theft. |
pg| ***** 136 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|The hand can proceed so many different ways, but we do our job, throwing poor declarer on lead when we can. He never gains a tempo and ends up taking only five tricks. |
