^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am certainly a big believer in preempts. But it is usually not a good idea, particularly in first and second seat to preempt when you have an opening bid. It makes it harder for your side to get to the best contract. |
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The idea behind a preempt is to interfere with the opponents when you have few points. The idea being it is more likely they own the majority of the points. But when you have an opener, that assumption no longer holds.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If a hand meets the rule of 20, you should not pre-empt. Basically most preempts include no more than 8 or 9 HCP--occasionally 10. Anything more than that and you should open at the 1-level.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A preempt does not just announce a long suit. It also announces a weak hand. There are many hands with long suits where you open at the 1-level and even 2@C. I will give the undo.|

In general, although there is a bridge saying "8 ever 9 never", meaning you play for the drop with 9 cards missing the queen. That is really not true. Even with no information, playing for the drop vs. the finesse is only 1%-2% better.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is a ton to discuss. Let's start with the play. North will make 6 clubs, so long as she plays the heart suit for no losers. If hearts are 3-2, it is easy. But if hearts are 4-1 North needs to decide who is more likely to have a 4-card suit (or even a 5-card suit). On this hand it is easy to decide. West showed long spades and diamonds. Therefore, if anyone is short in hearts, it is West.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The best way to play the heart suit is to cash the @HA and the @HQ. That way if hearts are 3-2 great. But if not, you still have the @HK10 in dummy to finesse against the jack.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When you play a hand, many players forget about the auction. But that is a big mistake on many hands. The auction gives you clues as to how to play the hand. And on this hand, it gave you a very clear clue as to how to play the hearts.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT|^B@2
sshmj: The reason I originally didn't open 4@S was fear for losing slam at our side.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As the comment by the West, it is possible that they have slam if East has the perfect hand. But given East is a passed hand, the best tactical bid is to open 4@S.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |

veeree: Can East bid 6@D over 5@H? |
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out E/W can make 6@D. Therefore, even on the auction given, East has a clear 6@D bid.|

PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over 6@D, I probably bid 6@H which goes down on a spade lead. Anyway, this hand shows the wonderful power of distribution. Each side can make a slam despite the fact that each side has "only" 20 HCP. Remember, you must highly value distributional hands.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


sb|e|NT|^B@2
sshmj: If you bid 6@H, we bid 6@S which makes unless the defense is super world class.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West is 100% correct. However, "double dummy" (meaning if you could see all 4 hands) you can beat 6@S. North would underlead her @HAQ to my @HK and I would give her a diamond ruff. But that almost would never happen in real life except for top experts. |
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the surface, in real life, if some pair found that defense I would be suspicious they were cheating. But let me change the bidding so I can better explain how a top expert partnership may find that line of defense.|

ub|7|NT||mb|6d6h6sppp|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This would be the auction ending in West playing 6@S and North is on lead. Please note that West bid 5@D and East raised t 6@D. Now given I bid 6@H it is not unreasonable for North to underlead her @HA hoping I have the HK and can give her a ruff.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So perhaps an expert pair would beat 6@S. But 6@S is a great contract as is 6@D and 6@C and even 6@H is not bad.|

Barbie1970: How do you know to lead a diamond in real life? |
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If North lead a heart and my king won, I would wonder, why did North underlead the @HA and, given the auction, and the fact that West bid 5@D, it would be very reasonable for South to assume that East/West had a 10-card diamond fit. Therefore North must be out of diamonds.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT|^B@2
sshmj: Even 6@s down 1 is still better than let 6@H making (-50 vs -1430).|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|6@S would make at almost every table. Only a world class pair might beat it, and even then it is not clear.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A good rule for all partnerships to follow is "It is never wrong to lead partner's suit." There may occasionally be a better lead but a) you have to find it and b) you better be right. So unless you have a very compelling reason not to (and they only come up once a year), just lead your partner's suit. My understanding with all may partners is, if you lead my suit, you cannot be criticized.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, you might say, passing 2NT was right as we didn't make even 2NT. In Match Points, pass was correct. Saving the 50 points might get us a few more Match Points. In IMPs, the extra 50 points are of little consequence.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And if it turns out we make 3NT (e.g. the @CQ is held by East) then the game bonus is worth 7 IMPs or so. We are risking 2 IMPs (an extra -50) for a gain of 7--good odds. That is why in IMPs, I rarely pass an invitational 2NT.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good play. I think North should ruff the diamond with the @HJ. Although it may turn out not to matter. Personally, although I think you should open 1NT any time you have the appropriate hand, I would open 1@S with the West hand. 1NT opening theory has changed in the past few years to allow the 1NT opener to have 2 doubletons (and some play even a singleton if it is an ace or king). |
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But I prefer to stick with the rule that you can only open 1NT with 1 doubleton at most. Otherwise, you start to lose some of the accuracy that a 1NT bid affords the auction. However, on this hand, the 1NT opener worked out better than a 1@S bid, despite opener's 5-2-4-2 distribution. If West opened 1@S, East would respond 1NT, West would bid 2@D, and East should pass. And 2@D probably does not make whereas 2@H did make.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|The club finesse loses but, because you played carefully on the first trick (when the @DJ was led), East has no way to reach the West hand for a spade return.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|East can see that you have at least ten tricks ready to take at this stage (five hearts, the @DA and four clubs). He therefore cashes the @SA in case you hold a third diamond, which can be ruffed in dummy, and would be able to throw both your spades away.|
PG| ***** 146 ***** |


NT||NT||sk||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|As the cards actually lie, it makes no difference whether he cashes the @SA or not. You will be able to discard two spades on dummy's club suit. The remaining tricks are yours and you can claim the contract.|

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|It's time to Count and to Plan. How many top tricks are there?|
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Spades: No top tricks;
Hearts: Two top tricks;
Diamonds: Three top tricks;
Clubs: One top trick.|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
You have six top tricks and we hope you are thinking that the Spade suit can offer you three additional tricks.|
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
By leading out the @SK (to knock out the @SA), the Spades will come in for four tricks if the suit breaks 3-3. However, what if they break 4-2?|
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Now - to the Hearts. Why is it clear that West has only four Hearts?|
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
West has led his fourth-best Heart). If his fourth highest Heart is the @H2 he can't have a smaller one, so can't have a five-card suit. QED (Quite Easily Deduced).|

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|It is probably right to take the @HA in hand rather than the @HK on table. This way you preserve more entries to the Spades.|

PG| ***** 171 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
You're afraid he will cash some Hearts? That's no problem too! If you remember from earlier, you saw that West's opening lead was the @H2 which meant that West only started with a four-card Heart suit.|
PG| ***** 172 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
The greatest number of Hearts that he will be able to cash now is two and no more.|
