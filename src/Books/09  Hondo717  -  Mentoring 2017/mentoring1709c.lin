But that is not even close to being true. West has 13 Dummy Points--9 HCP, 2 length points, and 2 points for the singleton. That is enough to force to game. Over 2@S or 2N, he would bid 4@S to show a min game force. Over 3@H, I think I still only bid 4@H.|

It's not the worst slam I have ever been in. It's on a finesse and 50% slams are ok. It's basically break even. But with 23 HCP I doubt many would get to slam.|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NDuring the live session West took some time to play the card which prompted the following remark by Howard.|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|At a real table, west should have been prepared well in advance for the club play and played low smoothly. Good declarers can pick up such things and place the @CK with West. But but here it turns out not to matter since I was taking the finesse anyway. With 3 cards out, the finesse is right especially since east is likely to be short in clubs.|

pg| ***** 35 ***** |


up|32|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A few points about this deal. First of all, this shows you the power of distribution. As I always say, distribution and fit are just as or more important than HCP. North South only have 18 HCP and the @HQ is wasted, it might as well be the @H2. And yet we can make 5.|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We have 16 working HCP because I have great distribution and we have 2 fits. Those are worth a lot more than lots of HCP as this hand demonstrates.|
pg| ***** 37 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On another point, east should bid 5@D over 4@S. With 6-5 distribution and a void you should be reluctant to let the opponents buy the contract. As it turns out they make 5@D or 5@H losing only one spade and one heart. But even if they went down it is better than letting us make 4@S.|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So remember, when you are distributional, you want to play offense not defense. Conversely when you are flat, you are more likely to want to defend than declare.|
pg| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Finally, my distribution (also 6-5) is why I broke the rule and bid 4@S. In fact, I was going to bid 4@S even if east passed. Once I know we have a fit, I am eager to play in game. If partner has as little as Axx of spades and a club card or two, 4@S has plays.|
pg| ***** 40 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Again, I picture partner with what he needs for me to make 4@S. Picture Bidding is an important skill to develop with distributional hands because point count is meaningless.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nicely done. This deal shows that the law of total tricks works. We have an 8-card fit, so we are too high. In IMPs I probably should pass. In Match Points 3@H down 1 might be better if they can make 3@D.|
pg| ***** 61 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|They probably cannot make 3@D. They are going to lose 2 spades, 1 heart, 1 diamond at best, and 1 club at least for down 1. They could easily be down 2. So my 3@H bid did not work out.|
pg| ***** 62 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had I known for sure that north only had 4 hearts I should not even consider it. Remember my competitive guidelines usually work. Only bid "3 over 3" if you have a 9-card fit or a singleton in their suit. I had neither.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is a good slam--75%. It needs either the @HA onside or the diamond finesse works. If the @HA is onside, then east can discard 2 diamonds on the @CQ and @HK.|
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If not, then needs the diamond finesse. If they both lose, that's the way it goes. So although I think 2NT is a fine bid, I also think, since west has 19 HCP and all suits controlled 4N right away is fine as well.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Double dummy it can be made. But the way it was played was reasonable. If east happens to play the @HA and sees the @HQ fall she can then get back to the board and finesse against north's @H10. But that is difficult to foresee.|
pg| ***** 93 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As west I wouldn't bid 5@H. West showed 10 points with her 2@C bid. She does have 2 hearts, but they are both small and her @SQ is very dubious. Had I had passed or only bid 3@S then west has a clear 4@H.|
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


NT||NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But once I bid 4@S you should be wary of going to the 5 level. There is a bridge saying "the 5 level belongs to the opponents." That is not always the case but it does mean you should be reluctant to go there because it is hard to take 11 tricks.|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|So, with East short in clubs (at least, we assume so from the take-out Double) there are five club tricks and four outside tricks.

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|A fascinating hand, dealt (inevitably?) by a malevolent computer for a pairs contest. The auction usually started with 1@C by North, Double (or 1@S) by East and, eventually, 3NT by South. |
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West, naturally enough, led the @S10 and South appears to have a cake-walk to nine tricks (five Clubs and four top tricks in hand). However, there's many a slip twixt the cup and the lip.|
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Most declarers led the @C3 to the @CA at trick two and blenched somewhat when East discarded. The problem now is that the Clubs are blocked; declarer can return to hand and lead another Club but West can cover the @C7 with the @C9 to force the @C10 and later play low on the @C8, giving North-South only four Club tricks.|
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|The way to success is for South to lead the @C7 (or the @C8 if you feel strongly about it) at trick two to the @CA. Now there are always five tricks in Clubs regardless of West's subsequent defense.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|If truth be told, some declarers who failed to see the necessity of leading the @C7 at trick two still recovered to make 3NT – in the process of cashing four Clubs East came under a lot of pressure and eventually had to concede a trick to declarer, usually by being stuck on lead and having to play a Diamond away from the @DK.|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So in practice this was often a tightly fought deal with 3NT making more often than not.|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|In the Lords v Commons match two declarers (on opposite sides) made 3NT while there were strange results at the other tables.

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|One of the hardest questions to answer (especially during the auction when you can only see 13 cards) is "Whose hand is this?" In other words, which side can make the highest scoring contract?|
pg| ***** 128 ***** |


NT||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Some hands clearly belong to one side and not the other but there are many deals where one side can make, say, 3@C and the other side can make, say, 3@H.|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Ensuring that you bid the full value of your cards (and trying to make the opponents fail to get the full value out of theirs) is what competitive auctions are all about. So then, whose hand is this? |

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|The question "whose hand is this?" is often a difficult one to answer. Here it is surprising that North-South can make the higher scoring contract, despite being outgunned in the points department. |
pg| ***** 164 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|North-South can make 3@S, while East-West, with 22 points to 18 for North-South, can only make 3@D. This hand belongs to North-South. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding. 
There are two Passes to West who opens 1@D. East responds 1@H and we have to decide whether to intervene with 1@S or not. |
pg| ***** 166 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Well, we certainly should, holding a fine Spade suit and a 5-4-3-1 hand. We have the boss suit (Spades) and our suit is very good (@SK Q J x x is not to be sneezed at). Although unlikely that the hand belongs to our side it is still possible that it does. |
pg| ***** 167 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|If not, we may still be able to force the opponents overboard with some judicious "pushing". Last, but by no means least, a 1@S overcall alerts our partner to the fact that we would like him to lead a Spade, should West declare the hand. |
pg| ***** 168 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|West Passes 1@S (some might bid 2@C - it is a moot point) and North raises us to 2@S. East competes with 3@D (high enough for us!) and that is Passed round to North. Holding decent trumps North is undeterred by the fact that we are a Passed hand and he competes to 3@S, a bid which ends the auction. |
pg| ***** 169 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|It is certainly surprising that we are able to buy the hand in 3@S when we are outgunned in the high-card department, but these things do happen. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Play. 
We have four obvious minor suit losers but might get away with losing nothing in Hearts or Spades. Everything, in fact, depends on locating the @HQ; a classic two-way finesse. |
pg| ***** 171 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|West cashes the @DA and astutely switches to a Club, picking three tricks up there. We ruff the Diamond continuation and have to take stock. Drawing trumps takes just two rounds so we have to determine the location of her ladyship, the @HQ. |
pg| ***** 172 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Well, East has bid 1@H, of course, and has only turned up with the @CA Q and (probably) the @DQ. Deciding that the @HQ must be the reason for the raise to 3@D we cash the @HA and run the @H10 through East. 3@S bid and made. |
