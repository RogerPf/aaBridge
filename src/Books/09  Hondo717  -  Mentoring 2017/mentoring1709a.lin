^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most people play 2@S  known as "Michaels" showing 5-5 in hearts and one of the minors. There is really no sense in playing 2@S as a natural overcall. First of all, it would be rare that you would have 5 spades once an opponent showed 5 spades.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|More importantly, even if you did have 5 spades, why would you want to play in spades, knowing you are getting a bad break. In fact, knowing that you have long spades increases the probability that the opponents have a misfit and you want to defend.|

A club is possible, but not likely to work out well, and in fact that will simply set up a club trick for me. So a heart is as good as anything.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss how to respond with 6-4 hands. There are 2 schools of thought. One is to bid 6-4-6 meaning you bid your 4 card suit next and then repeat your 6-card suit which would mean I should bid 2@C.|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other is 6-6-4 which is repeat your 6 card suit first. Most experts use 6-4-6. However, I adjust that some. If my 6 card suit is a minor, then I do use 6-4-6. If my 2 suits are hearts and spades I do use 6-4-6 (e.g. I would bid 2@H here if I had 4 hearts).|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But if my 6-card suit is a major and 4-card suit is a minor I repeat my 6-card suit because I think letting partner know about your 6-card suit should take priority.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That worked out well. A few points. The most important is, when you are declarer and have a 5-card side suit you can often set up 1 or more of its low cards. In this case North should see that she has 6 diamonds between the 2 hands (5 in North, 1 in South) and the most likely division is 4-3.|
pg| ***** 103 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if she ruffs enough diamonds, the last diamond is likely to set up. That is an important thing to learn as declarer. It's hard to keep track of all suits, but you should be able to keep track of trump and one other suit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, as I tell my partners, even if leading my suit turns out to be wrong, you never can lose the post mortem discussion/ Therefore, if you always lead partner's suit you will be right most of the time.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Hard hand to play, Also hard to defend. I had to visualize keeping declarer in dummy to maximize our tricks. Also, I think if I cover the @H10 with the @HJ that gives declarer more problems. That's why defense is so hard. It's hard to know what's right to do sometimes. Anyway good line by east. Well done.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|How much is your hand worth, facing the take-out double of West's weak 2@H? You could begin with a strength-showing bid of 3@H. The original South was lacking in patience and decided to blast straight into the most likely contract. South took a pot at 6@S.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|On deals where you have plenty of trumps in both hands, you can sometime eliminate one or two side suits (which will prevent the defenders leading those suits without giving a ruff-and-sluff). After doing that, you throw a defender on lead, forcing him to give you a trick.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|The responder to a take-out double has two duties: to choose a denomination and to give some indication of the strength of his hand. South's leap to 6@S fulfilled these duties admirably and West led the @DQ. How would you have played the small slam? |
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You win the diamond lead in the dummy and draw trumps in three rounds. You must now look for a way to avoid two heart losers, despite the fact that West's opening weak two-bid has told you that the @HK will surely be offside. Have you any ideas?|
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West's bid has also told you that hearts are likely to be split 6-1. You should cash dummy's @DK and ruff a diamond, eliminating that suit. You continue with the ace, queen and king of clubs, eliminating that suit too. Finally, you lead a low heart from dummy, ducking East's card, which happens to be the @H9 here. |
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


NT|^B@2
What can West do? if he follows with any card lower than the nine, East will be left on lead and will have to give you a ruff-and-sluff. You will be able to ruff in one hand and discard a heart loser from the other hand. Nor will West fare any better if he overtakes the @H9. |
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


NT|^B@2
He will then have to lead back into your @HA Q or give a ruff-and-sluff himself. Pre-emptive opening bids may be a pain in the neck during the auction but they often give away information that can help you to play your contract. |
