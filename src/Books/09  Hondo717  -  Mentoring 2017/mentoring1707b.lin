NT|^B@2
It was unlucky that I did not have the @CA rather than KQJ. If I did, then 6@H makes. Also on a spade lead 6@H also makes because North can throw a club on a spade. So I don't mind being there. But the most important point is North has a really nice hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The hand is worth a lot more than 12 HCP.

NT|^B@2
Then the declarer add ons are 4 for the void, 2 for the singleton and 1 for the side diamond suit. That gets the hand up to 25. It is not a 2@C opener because it does not have 4 quick tricks. But it can take an awful lot of tricks despite only 12 HCP.|

On the other hand, if you have a chance to overcall NT you should. That gets your point count across. Double by West shows heart shortness and your points are unknown. So, 2NT is a much better description of the hand.|

And if your double causes me to play the hand such that I make it will cost you a lot of extra points.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would like to overcall 1NT to show my 15 HCP, but there are 2 problems with that bid.
1) I don't have a club stopper and 2) I have really nice spades. So with this hand it is clear to bid 1@S.
if East had opened 1@D or 1@H it would not be as clear.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As I have said many times, you should strain to overcall (or open) 1NT whenever you have the appropriate hand. So over 1@D or 1@H I would not quarrel if you chose to bid 1NT. But on this hand, with the wonderful spades (3 honors and the 9), I still think 1@S is better, particularly since I barely have 15 HCP.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Pass is most reasonable call for East. East has 3 flawed alternatives. With 15 HCP, given the 2@H bid, game is very possible. But the heart singleton, although it is nice that the singleton is the @HA, means there is at least a slight misfit. |

3NT is also reasonable, since the K10xx of spades could easily be 2 stoppers. 4@H, I probably bid 4@H, is not unthinkable either. All in all, pass could easily be right.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well done. As it turns out, West will make 4@H against most defenders. But against an expert pair of defenders, West only makes 3@H. So East's pass is right in theory. However,  a 4@H bid would have worked out well in practice much of the time. BTW, the 2@H bid by West was a good call.|
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is why an expert would defeat 4@H. When North gets in the with @HQ, he should realize since North started with 3 spades, dummy started with 4, and South promised 5 spades with his overcall, West is out of spades. And dummy's clubs are going to provide discards for losers. So an expert North would lead a diamond to set up any diamond tricks that are available. The defense ends up taking 4 tricks - 2 hearts, 1 spade, and 1 diamond.|

AT| You might save yourself a diamond loser by leading successfully towards the @dQ.|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
You would also like to lead towards the @CQ, since if East holds the @CK you could set up a discard for one of your diamond losers. How can you do this effectively?|

NT|^B@2 
When you lead a club towards your hand, East rises with the @CK. This blocks the club suit, which is the reason why you needed two trump entries to the dummy.|

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|The advantage of a suit contract (as opposed to No-trumps) is that you can generate extra tricks by ruffing losers in the short trump hand. This deal exemplifies the principle. |

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Spades: Six easy winners, no losers;
Hearts: One winner, two losers (from the perspective of South). However, with a Heart shortage on table only one loser as you can ruff a losing Heart; |
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Diamonds: Two winners, no loser; 
Clubs: One sure loser, maybe two. It depends on the location of the @CA. |
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You can count nine winners off the top - six Spades, one Heart and two Diamonds. Where's the tenth? |

This is an easy question - too easy for us to give you a hint...|
