But with my flat hand and pretty bad hearts it is more likely we go down in 3 than make 4. So I think pass here is the best action.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Assuming hearts are 3-2 we are going to take 3 hearts and a ruff for at least (4 tricks). 2 spades is 6. 1 diamond is 7 and 1 club is 8. If spades behave (3-3 or doubleton honor) I might make an extra trick and if the heart finesse is on I might even make 4 hearts.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Which would mean my wimpy pass of 2@H did not work out :). But today seems to be the day for low percentage games to make because making 4 depends on the heart finesse (50%) plus 3-2 hearts (68%) plus spades being 3-3 or a doubleton honor (50%). I would say game is around 20% more or less.|

Further, as I mentioned earlier, I would have bid 2N with West hand. Yes it is a risk, but it is ok to take a risk when there is a good upside. And the upside is that if you get to 3NT you get a good result. |

However, there is one slight problem. What is it? It appears that the opponents will be able to knock out your spade stopper before you knock out their club stopper. This hand is a tempo hand. How are you going to counter it? Over to you.|

What if you play that innocent looking @S3 on this trick? It would do no good for West to hop up with the @SK as that will provide you with two spade stoppers, so West will win cheaply, cash the @SK, and down 1. Let us go back to when you should have played @S3.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Why did West switch?|
PG| ***** 141 ***** |


AT|

Because he is obviously out of spades. If you remember the auction, East was the one who overcalled 1@S so West has a maximum of three spades.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Play:
West leads the @S5 to dummy's @S10 and East's ace. Before playing to this trick, it would be wise to think about how you will play to the next trick as you can 100% expect a low spade back from East. |

To start off with, you can count that you have four top tricks; two hearts, and two diamonds - that's not much!|
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The suit that offers the best prospect as a source of tricks is no doubt the club suit. Provided that they are not 5-0, you should be able to set up four club tricks. This brings the total up to eight, which is looking better.|
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Given that the opponents will be attacking the spades, you will eventually get one trick in spades as well, adding one more to the tally. However, there is one slight danger.|
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Since RHO did not win with the @SK, we know that West has that card. We also know that we can expect RHO to return a small spade on the second trick.|
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This means that the opponents will be able to knock out your spade stopper before you can knock out their club stopper. And, to boot, you can be fairly certain that our RHO is the favorite to hold the @CA based on the 1@S overcall.|
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Apparently you have a seemingly innocent spade suit combination, until you realize the importance of your fourth (little) spade! When your RHO wins the first trick with the @SA and fires back a small one, what if you play that innocent looking @S3 on this trick?|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It would do no good for West to hop up with the @SK as that will provide you with two spade stoppers, so West will win cheaply, cash the @SK, and ... that's it for the defense. West has only three spades (remember the auction), and is unable to continue spades, giving you the time and tempo to drive out the @CA.|

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|A lot of defense revolves around not giving declarer something he doesn't deserve. Often the right play is to sit in your chair and wait patiently for what is rightfully yours. This deal is a case in point.|

East has the @HK Q. North would have played the @HK had he held it. The @H9 has forced the Queen suggesting that North has the @H10. Whether East has @HK Q x or @HK Q alone you can't tell.|
