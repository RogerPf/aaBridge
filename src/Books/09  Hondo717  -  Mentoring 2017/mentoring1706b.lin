Further, the @D10 allowed East to take 3 diamond tricks rather than 2 by finessing South for the @DQ. Without the @D10, East would have had to finesse North for the @DQ which, given the weak 2, is less likely to work. Based on the bidding East just guessed who to play for the @DQ.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Tough hand to play, especially with the bad club and bad heart break. With a 3-2 heart break the hand is relatively easy. But the important point is to remember that new suits by responder are ALWAYS forcing. There are only one and a half exceptions to that rule.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If responder is a passed hand, then opener can pass responder's first new suit if opener has a very weak hand but does so only very rarely. That is really only a half an exception. |
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT|^B@2
BTW, if you want to agree that new suits by responder are always forcing, even when responder is a passed hand, that is a very reasonable way to play.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The other exception is the one mentioned by West. If opener rebids 1NT then any new suits below the first suit mentioned by responder are not forcing, and are simply a choice of part scores. Let me illustrate on the table.|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||md|4|uB|14|NT|^B@2
For example if it goes as you will see now,|MB|1CP1SP1NP2H|AT| 2@H is not forcing (but only because of the 1NT bid). It shows 5 spades, 4 or 5 hearts, and a weak hand. Opener passes 2@H or corrects to 2@S.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On the other hand,|UB|7|at| if for example bidding goes as you see now,|mb|1CP1HP1NP2S|at| 2@S IS forcing.|

PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT|^B@2
brains88: Since I play NMF, 2@H is not forcing, but I fail to see why my bidding should change if opener rebids 2@C rather than 1NT.|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because spades is a higher suit than responder's first suit of hearts. Your bidding needs to change when opener bids 2@C because you need to be able to make forcing bids as responder without taking up too much bidding room.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT|^B@2
There is a big difference between a 1NT rebid and a 2@C rebid. A 1NT rebid is pretty descriptive and you can often guess opener's distribution within a card or two. But 2@C can show a whole variety of hands so you need more room as responder when you have a strong hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think DONT is one of the best competitive conventions you can learn.

NT|^B@2
So if you have even a moderate amount of points and the right distribution for DONT (5-4 or 5-5 or a 6-card suit) you should make a DONT bid over 1NT.|

If you pass 1NT you are often ceding the board to the opponents and you are likely destined for at best an average result and often a below average result.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Great bid by West. Many people would incorrectly pass. West's hand is worth much much more than its 10 HCP. 6-4 distribution is wonderful and the void is terrific.|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


mb|1H|mb|D|mb|P|mb|1S|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1@S bid is ok, but West's hand after the double just grew tremendously. Let us count West's |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dummypoints,Dummy Points Count.^*N|CP||FP||at| 10 HCP, 2 length points and 4 points for the void with 4 spades--16 points. So using Bergen hand evaluation it is still barely worth a 1@S rebid. But if you wanted to bid 2@S over the double (17-19) I would not say that was wrong.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A Kib: But West will be the declarer. Why should we count the Dummy Points instead of the Declarer Points? I am really confused.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good question. First let me explain the bidding further. The auction is basically the equivalent of 1@C-P-1@S-P-?. In that auction a raise to 2@S raise would show a min opener (13-16 Bergen Dummy Points). A raise to 3@S would show a medium opener (17-19 Bergen dummy points). And a raise to 4@S would show 20+.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The actual auction is equivalent but slightly different in that double has replaced the 1@S bid. So opener has more room for their rebid. Therefore 1@S by opener (Wet here) shows a min opener and a jump to 2@S shows a medium opener (17-19).|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now as to your confusion on counting Bergen Dummy Points for West while West would be the declarer. This is one of those auctions like a transfer auction where the person who bid the suit first is considered the dummy for the purposes of Bergen Hand Evaluation. |
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Had North passed and East bid 1@S, I assume you would have no problem having West count Bergen Dummy Points. That is essentially what happened. East's negative double is basically a way to bid 1@S. So that's how you have to think about the auction. |
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


NT|^B@2
East "bids" spades first and is therefore the hand that counts Bergen Declarer Points. West is raising spades and therefore counts Dummy Points.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand is a testament to the power of distribution. With 25 HCP between them EW still made 6. It took 3-2 breaks in both black suits. So it was a little over 50% that 6 would make and it is very hard to bid. Very few if any pairs would get to slam. But it is a pretty good slam because of West's great distribution and the fact that the hands fit very well together.|
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
The most important takeaway is that you must value distributional hands a lot more than most players do. 6-4 hands are worth much more (often 50% or more) than their HCP indicate. Hands such as West's where all their strength is in their 2 longest suits, are particularly powerful.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In IMPs, I would pass with the North hand. Partner heard your reverse and chose to pass. In Match Points I might bid 4@C but never in IMPs. There are several important issues which need to be considered.|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


NT|^B@2
North went down one for a -100. That is not a good result. Granted, the North hand would much rather declare than defend. And in Match Points, with the South hand I might very well double 3@H to let North know I had some good defense. But in IMPs I can't take the risk.|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The gain (+50 if E/W down 1) is not worth the risk of doubling them into game if it makes. But by the same token North should pass. South heard the reverse and chose not to bid.|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Had North passed the 3@H by East, we would have a much better result. We were venerable and down one was -100. East/West not vulnerable would be down one or even two--losing  2 heart tricks, 2 diamond tricks and a spade trick.|
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So by bidding 4@C rather than passing, North was -100 instead of +50 (or possibly +100). The 150 point swing is worth 4 IMPs. So the risk was not worth the reward.|
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
In 3@H I probably lead a club. I don't want a ruff with a natural trump trick. East must lose at least 2 heart tricks 1 spade trick and 2 diamond tricks. It is good to be aggressive, but at unfavorable vulnerability and when competing to the 4 level, you need to show some caution.|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Both of those factors indicate less aggressiveness (although you still don't want to be too timid). But once you push the opponents to the 3-level you have often done your job on competitive hands|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Personally I would have bid 4@H with the North hand. My 3@H bid shows an invitational hand. A double by me would have simply shown a weakish hand with 5 hearts. With 2 aces, a well placed @SK, 14 HCP, and a 5-card suit, I think North has a clear accept and should bid 4@H.|
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Perhaps I should have bid 4@H myself. With a 9-card fit I would have. but with an 8-card fit I tend to be a little less aggressive. Its definitely an iffy 4@H bid. Needing 3-2 in both red suits. In IMPs I want to be there.|

NT|^B@2
Over 4@H I am not sure what I do with the East hand. I would really like to bid 4@S. And at any vulnerability except the one we are at (EW vul, NS not) I probably would. But with a balanced hand and some defense I pass.|MB|PPP|

It turns out, if West leads a club which she should since East opened 1@C, 4@H is down 1.|PC|C9|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Generally speaking you should err on the side of bidding more rather than less. And any hand that meets the rule of 20 should be opened IMO.

In these positions you should count declarer's tricks. If East has a six-card Spade suit you can't beat him but what if he has just five? He has five trump tricks and three Clubs for eight. Don't give him the ninth trick with a Heart lead.|pc|d4|

up|52|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|A part-score deal where there were some awkward bidding decisions and some sloppy play when the hand first appeared. After East opens 1@S South has a tricky call. 2@D on such a poor suit, vulnerable, is not really to be contemplated especially as North is a Passed hand. Indeed, many experts these days won't bid at the two-level without a six-card suit. Double is a possibility, albeit without four Hearts. No one could criticize a Pass.|
PG| ***** 193 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Anyway, West has an obvious raise to 2@S regardless of whether South bids 2@D (ugh), Doubles or Passes but there are still awkward competitive decisions to be made. In the original event (admittedly a match-point pairs tournament where players tend to be cavalier in the auction) many North-South pairs bid to 3@D or 3@H. These horrible contracts should suffer the fate of going down, possibly by two tricks, but many Easts unwisely took the push to 3@S. |
PG| ***** 194 ***** |


NT|^B@2
To make this shaky contract you have to play to set up the Clubs - basically, you need the Clubs to break 3-3 and for the trumps to break also. Oh, yes - you need the @HA onside as well. As you can see, all of this comes to pass and North-South have to defend very tightly to beat the contract against best play. |
PG| ***** 195 ***** |


NT|^B@2
How? By leading trumps at every opportunity and denying East a Diamond ruff on table. True, declarer gets Clubs going but that's not enough tricks as dummy either gets end-played to lead Hearts (declarer throwing Diamonds) or the defense makes three Diamond tricks (declarer throwing Hearts). |
PG| ***** 196 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In the actual pairs event, though, 3@S down two was a depressingly common score, even after the @CA lead. 
There was only one making contract in the Lords v Commons match, an East-West pair recording 110 for bidding and making 2@S. At the other tables 2@S went two down (no, me neither), 3@S went two down and one North-South pair went three down in 4@H. A total swing of just 90 to the Commons.|

So, you can count eight top tricks and (obviously) need one more. Diamonds are the most likely source (they are stronger than your Clubs) but there is a catch. You lack entries to the dummy. Maybe you need a 3-3 Diamond break...?|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|West leads the @HQ against 3NT from the top of his sequence and we pause to take stock and to count our tricks. |
PG| ***** 220 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We can see eight on top (two Spades, two Hearts, three Diamonds and a Club) and so, logically enough, need one more. |
PG| ***** 221 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Diamonds are the most likely source of an extra trick (or two) and we would like to play three rounds then surrender a fourth round (if needed) to establish our fifth Diamond as a winner. |
PG| ***** 222 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However there is a catch in that Plan as we only have one side-entry to dummy - the @SK - so it looks as if we need Diamonds to break 3-3. However, initial appearances can be deceptive; the @D9 8 7 are important spot-cards. |
PG| ***** 223 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Were we to cash the top Diamonds, cross to the @SK and try the Ace of Diamonds we'd make ten tricks on a 3-3 Diamond split and eight tricks if the suit did not oblige. The essence of this deal is to make nine tricks. Is there a way of maximising our chances of making the contract? |
PG| ***** 224 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We win the opening lead in hand with the @HK. Now we cash the @DK Q to unblock the suit. On the @DQ West drops the @D10. Suddenly, a shaft of sunlight appears through the clouds. This means we can safely overtake the @DQ with North's @DA to establish the suit for four tricks. |
PG| ***** 225 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We then play one of the @D9 8 7 to knock out the @DJ and make our third and fourth Diamond tricks. As it happens, the @D9 is ducked but that only delays the inevitable. |
PG| ***** 226 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We continue with the @D8 which draws the @DJ. East returns his partner's suit by leading the @H9, which we win with the @HA. |
PG| ***** 227 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We now have five tricks and have done all the hard work. All that remains is to cross to dummy with the @SK, cash the @D7, then come back to the Ace of Clubs and take the Ace of Spades to make our contract. After that we lose interest in the hand as the defenders scoop up the rest. |
PG| ***** 228 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Note that we'd have given up an overtrick with this line of play had West started with @DJ 10 x. Big deal.|
