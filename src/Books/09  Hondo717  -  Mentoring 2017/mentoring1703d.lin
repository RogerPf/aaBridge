^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played. Once a diamond is not led, there is nothing the defense can do since the club finesse works. If the club finesse doesn't work, and a diamond comes back West might be a little worried.|

Although with Q10xx in diamonds, not too worried. Regardless, West needs to set up clubs to come to 9 tricks. here really is no other way to play the hand.|

Therefore, the @H7 is attitude most likely and denies the Q (unless North started with Q87 or Q107) which is possible. But North can only make the appropriate lead and hope I figure out what she has.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The play was fine and I particularly like East's 4@S bid. It shows very good hand evaluation. By bidding 4@S, East is showing 20 points though East only has 10 HCP.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But her hand is huge once partner shows a 5-card spade suit. If partner has as little as the @CK or @CA and nothing else 4@S is making. Partner might even have a singleton club and no HCP and 4S still has plays.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I am not saying partner can bid with 0 points. I am just explaining why the East hand is worth the 20 point jump to 4@S even with only 10 HCP.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The East hand is an excellent illustration of the power of good distribution which is often more important than HCP. I would bid 4@S without counting my Bergen Points because it is obvious to me that 4@S is the correct bid.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But let us count |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dummypoints,Bergen Dummy Points^*N|CP||FP||at| and see what they say about the worth of the East hand.|

East has 10 HCP and 3 length points for 13 |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=bergenstartingpoints,Starting Points^*N|CP||FP||at|.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Once partner bids 1@S, you can add 3 points for each singleton (you get 3 points for a singleton with 4+ trump). That gives East a 19 pointer which is close to 20.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you can see, they are making 1@S at most. So had we bid 2@D perhaps we push them into a contract they can't make.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Let us see how we do in 2@D. We take 4 diamonds and 2 hearts for sure and that may be it. Perhaps a club. So it's a wash if they let us play in 2@D. But they might end up in 2@H or 2@S.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT|^B@2
For example, over 2@D East might bid 2@H. Not saying East should, but some East's might. Or even if East passes 2@D West might decided to bid 2@S with SJ10 doubleton which is reasonably nice 2-card support.|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So 2@D has little to lose and much to gain. Remember the opponents don't always make optimal bidding decisions. Therefore, anything you can do to introduce uncertainty in the bidding and put pressure on them is good.|

^-|cp||ht|c|fp||at|^b@2^z@3CHEEKS was a grandson of slaves, was born in a poor neighbourhood of New Orleans known as the "Back of Town." His father abandoned the family when the child was an infant. His mother became a prostitute and the boy and his sister had to live with their grandmother. Early in life he proved to be gifted for music and, with three other kids, he sang in the streets of New Orleans. His first gains were coins that were thrown to them.|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


AT| 

A Jewish family, Karnofsky, who had immigrated from Lithuania to the USA, had pity for the 7-year-old boy and brought him into their home. Initially giving him 'work' in the house, to feed this hungry child. There he remained and slept in this Jewish family's home where, for the first time in his life, he was treated with kindness and tenderness. When he went to bed, Mrs. Karnovsky sang him a Russian lullaby that he would sing with her.|
pg| ***** 82 ***** |


AT| 

Later, he learned to sing and play several other Russian and Jewish songs. Over time, this boy became the adopted son of this family. The Karnofskys gave him money to buy his first musical instrument; as was the custom in the Jewish families. They sincerely admired his musical talent. Later, when he became a professional musician and composer, he used these Jewish melodies in compositions, such as |CP|1|fp|2|AT|^*Hhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzcpUdBw7gs,St. James Infirmary^*N|CP||fp||at| and |CP|1|fp|2|

In memory of this family and until the end of his life, he wore a star of David and said that in this family, he had learned "how to live real life and determination." You might recognize his name.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West has the hand with 4 hearts and 3 spades. So it is legal for West to either bid 3@H or 3@S. Which one West picks is up to partnership agreement. There are 3 possible agreements:|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


NT|^B@2
 a) bid 3-card support first ;
 b) bid 4 card major first or; 
 c) always bid hearts.|
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
I normally prefer (a) - showing 3-card support to another 4-card major. However, in this case, with 4-3-3-3 distribution there are no ruffing values in the West hand and I would break my rule and respond 3@H over 3@D. Because 4@H is likely to be at least as good a contract as 4@S.|
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


NT|^B@2
And if East bids 3N over 3@H, West can still bid 4@S. Please remember, even though you have system rules, on occasion you can break them when you have a good reason. Let us try that style in this occasion to make a point.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is unlucky that hearts break badly. But this hand does illustrate why in general I prefer playing in a 5-3 fit to a 4-4 fit although many teachers claim the 4-4 fit is better. I prefer it because in a 5-3 fit, it is easier to handle a 4-1 break which does happen almost 1/3 of the time.|
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So if I were West, even though I would bid 4@H and break my normal rule of showing 3-card support first I would now be regretting that decision.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With the bad heart break there is a slightly better way to play the hand although it turns out 4@H is still down. Once the heart break is discovered West should run spades and hope North started with 3 spades. In that case West can throw a club on the 4th spade.|
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


NT|^B@2
And if the defense then mistakenly leads a diamond, ruff a diamond in dummy and throw another club on the 5th spade and make the hand. Here because North only had 2 spades that line does not work.|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Also, there is a case to be made for West to make a safety play in hearts at trick 2 and lead a low heart and play the 10. Not because West expects to win the trick. But because if hearts are 3-2 it doesn't matter.|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


NT|^B@2
And if they are not, and North happens to have 4 hearts to the QJ then the hand makes. But that is almost a double dummy play. So drawing 2 rounds of trump and running spades was a reasonable line of play.|

11 HCP, 1 quality suit point, 1 length point, and 2 doubletons = 15. So I have a 4@H bid. On the other hand, since we have a minimum of 25 (close enough to 26), however, with many 10 or even 11 point hands that partner might have it wouldn't surprise me if 4@H goes down.|

With a 9-card fit, 3@H is the right bid. Let us see how they do in 3@H assuming North does not bid 4@C. They lose 2 spades, one club, one heart for sure, and one diamond for down 1.That is better than our making a club partial.|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding.
West opens 1@S and East responds 2@D. This is classic mistake ##1. Why bid a minor suit when you can show your strength and primary support for partner's major suit by bidding 3@S? Don't ask us!|
PG| ***** 213 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West now forces to game with 3@C and East gives preference to 3@S. This is mistake ##2. With a minimum hand for a two-level response, no Aces and side-suits of dubious worth, East should be trying to dampen West's ardor with a discouraging leap to 4@S.|
PG| ***** 214 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West, fondly imagining he is facing a decent hand, leaps into Ace-asking territory with Blackwood although that is clearly mistake ##3. Blackwood should not be employed on a hand containing an uncontrolled side-suit - for all West knows he is missing the @HA K. |
PG| ***** 215 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Also, what would he do if East owned up to holding just one Ace? Sign-off in 5@S or bid the slam? It's an age-old dilemma.|
PG| ***** 216 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Anyway, there is no problem when East denies an Ace; with slam completely out of the question West hurriedly slams on the brakes with 5@S, desperately hoping he isn't too high.|
PG| ***** 217 ***** |


NT|^B@2
5@S is too high, of course. 4@S doesn't make (and is unlucky to fail) but it is especially inept to reach the five-level on this type of hand.|
