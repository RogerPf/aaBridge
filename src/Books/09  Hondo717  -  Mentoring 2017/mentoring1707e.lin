^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand illustrates an important defensive principle. If you know declarer is in danger of setting up a long suit for discards you must defend aggressively, not passively. By that I mean you have to try and take your side suit tricks ASAP even at the risk of setting up extra tricks for declarer.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is more comfortable to defend passively, meaning you try not and give away tricks and often that is a good way to defend. But on some hands you must defend aggressively, when you can see declarer making their contract if you don't take your tricks ASAP.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Should West bid 4@H? I would. East bid 3@H without knowing about West's 3-Card support and West has a nice spade suit which will provide lots of discards. So I think 4@H is a good bid. Remember, strain to bid close games in IMPs and also strain to bid game when you have a 9-card fit. And be conservative when you have an 8-card fit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is not a good bid. Let us change your bid.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |

PG| ***** 22 ***** |


mb|2H|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Use the LOTT in general to decide when to raise. So without the double North should not raise. And 2@H is a good bid. It should not be forcing over the double. If there were no double most play it is forcing. I prefer to play it is not (as does Bergen), but that is not standard.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, even if you play it is forcing over pass, it is not forcing over the double. Given I preempted, what should redouble (the first bid by North) mean here? There is no standard meaning. But what I like to play is that redouble shows a doubleton with one of the top 3 honors in partner's suit. If we played that, then North's redouble was correct.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


mb|P|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Will pass over 2@H? Although North may have a 5-card suit, a 6-card suit is more likely. It is also likely North has no more than 2 spades. In theory, according to my competitive guidelines, I can assume they will end up in 2@S in an 8+ card fit. And, if we have an 8-card heart fit, it is ok to bid 3 over 2. BTW, North can make that same assumption.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


mb|p|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Since I almost surely have less than 4 spades, North knows the opponents have at least an 8-card spade fit. When deciding what the weak-2 bidder has, you can assume that he or she has no more than a doubleton in a side suit--most of the time--and almost never more than 3.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, although it does technically violate the law of total tricks, if North wanted to bid 3@D (as a "3 over 2S" bid using my competitive guidelines) I think that would be very reasonable.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is why I violated 2nd hand low. If West has the @CJ it either doesn't matter, or if it is a singleton, I will win the trick. And if North has the @CJ and it drops, my @C10 is high. Therefore, there are no situations where playing the @CK is wrong.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are several situations where playing second low is wrong. I am not saying it is easy to know when to violate 2nd hand low. There are a few situations (the most obvious one being you set the contract) when 2nd hand high is fine. And if you plan to violate it, you should figure it out well before you have to make a decision because far more often you must train yourself to play 2nd hand low smoothly.|

The @HK is a little tricky to evaluate. It is probably worth nothing. So assuming that is the case, I have 10 HCP (discounting the @HK). I have 1 length point, I have 1 quality suit point, I get 2 points for the singleton, and 1 point for the side 4 card suit. That's 15 which is enough or me to bid 4@S.|mb|4S|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it turns out, 4@S is not a good contract because we had a bad fit. We had 3 diamond losers and our heart honors were wasted. If either of our heart honors had been in the diamond suit say the (@HK in my hand had been the @DQ instead) 4@S would make.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So there was nothing wrong with the bidding. Sometimes you get an unmakable contract because of a bad fit. But it is rare when you use Bergen hand evaluation. And even on that hand, there was a path to 10 tricks if the defense slipped at all.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|What's that saying again? Oh, right. The good thing about bidding bad contracts is that you will need to play even better to make up for it! I hear you say - Yes, you will be put in one of those contracts. The good part is that you will be shielded from the auction! |

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, this is clearly the perfect situation where you nod in heavy agreement when North says, "Good luck partner!" as he lays down the dummy. Remember to count your tricks first.|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Firstly you probably hope that spades don't break worse than 3-1. What else?|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Evidently you also need something good to happen in the club suit in order to collect five club tricks.|
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
It's no good to collect four club tricks whilst ruffing a club, because you really need all five clubs so you can discard three hearts in your hand.|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
So that's the gist of it. This whole deal hinges on how you play the club suit.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Why is the @C10 the better play? Wouldn't it be embarrassing if LH opponent wins it with the jack? Oh, most definitely!|
PG| ***** 143 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
However, this is a percentage-play problem. With no other intermediate cards, cashing the ace, king, and queen gains if the suit splits 3-3. Finessing the ten wins when your RHO has @CJ x, @CJ x x, and @CJ x x x.|
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
So, by finessing the @C10, you will go down in a makeable contract if your LHO has precisely @CJ x x. As against that, you'll make your slam when your RHO has @CJ x or @CJ x x x.|
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If RHO has @CJ x x either play will work. If the clubs are distributed any other way you are going down.|pc|c2|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Opening Lead: @DQ. Yes, evidently the @HA would have worked out better on this deal, but leading unsupported aces against slams backfires more often than not. |
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


NT||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Play: After surviving the opening lead, you realize that the contract has a shot of making. Assuming trumps are no worse than 3-1, you will be able to get five trumps (in hand), the @DA, a diamond ruff in dummy which comes to a total of seven tricks. |
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This means that we must be able to play the club suit in such a way that will bring us five club tricks. It does not mean we try to ruff a club to set up dummy's fourth club trick, but it means no ruffs can be made and we must take all five club tricks. |
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This now becomes a matter of a suit combination problem. |
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With no other intermediate cards to back up the club suit (except for the @C10), by cashing the ace, king, and queen in the suit only gains if the suit splits 3-3. |
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Even if the suit breaks 4-2 and the jack is doubleton, you would still need to ruff out the fourth club. |
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


NT|^B@2
By finessing with the ten gains when your RHO has @CJ x, @CJ x x, and @CJ x x x. |
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Think of it this way. A 3-3 break is about a 36% chance of success, whereas needing the @CJ onside (with East) is about 50%.|
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It's not exactly 50% because even if East has the singleton @CJ, or @CJ x x x x, or @CJ x x x x x , then it wouldn't help anyway. However, by negating those holdings with East from 50% will surely still be greater than a 36% chance of success.|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Yes, it may mean that you might feel like an egg has hit your face if LH opponent is able to win with the @CJ, but at least you can say that you played with the odds.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|This Club lead has exposed four quick losers: two Clubs and two Diamonds. How do you plan to reduce this number to three?|
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In general, there are three main ways of reducing the number of losers: finessing, ruffing and discarding. |
PG| ***** 166 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Here you have no chance of finessing or ruffing your minor-suit losers. You must aim to discard one of them on dummy's Heart suit. How can this be done?|
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Dummy's Heart suit offers you two possibilities. If West holds the @HK, you can finesse the @HQ successfully and discard a loser on the @HA.|
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
If, instead, East holds the @HK you can cross to the @HA and lead the @HQ to trap the King. Which of these two methods will you choose? What is the reason for your choice?|
