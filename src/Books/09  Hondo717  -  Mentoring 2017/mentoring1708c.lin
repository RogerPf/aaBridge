^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason being, the auction   2@C - p - 2@D - p -3@D   gets you too high too fast. I am not saying never open 2@C with diamonds, but be very reluctant to do so.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand shows the importance of intermediate cards (10s, 9s, 8s) on many hands. The @S10 allowed East to lead the @SQ because with the singleton @SJ on the board the @SQ10 was essentially the equivalent of East holding the @SQJ. And from QJ East would have led the Q therefore, with the singleton @SJ on the board, the lead of the @SQ is equivalent to East having QJ because of her 10 and the @S9 was also important.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't mind 1NT rebid with the singleton heart because I bid hearts. but it shows 12-14.
North's starting points = 20. North has 17 HCP, 1 length point, and 2 quality suit points. So 1NT is way too weak. I wouldn't hate 2NT and her other choice is 2@D, which is a reverse. |
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Rebidding 2@C is also too weak. You have to show your strength. Your choices are to either reverse with 2 diamonds showing 16+ with 4 diamonds and 5+ clubs or bid 2NT showing 18-19. I think 2@D is slightly better.|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |

mb|2D|NT||mb|P|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding after a reverse are often tricky. Sometimes neither partner is sure whether or not their side has enough for game. The |CP|1|fp|2|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=reverses,Reverse^*N|CP||fp||at| can be done on as little as 16 and responder can have as little as 6.|
pg| ***** 53 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, opener can have a very nice hand 18+ which means they have a game force. Or responder could have 9+ which means they know their side has game. I think many experts make reverse auctions way too complicated.|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My simple but effective method for handling a reverse is:
If responder has 9+ they bid |CP|1|fp|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=4sf,4th Suit Forcing^*N|CP||fp||at|. If not, they bid something else.|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That way, opener (Reverser) knows immediately whether or not responder thinks their side is in a game force. With a min reverse, opener can stop below game. With a max reverse they can bid on to game.|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I am now bidding an artificial 2@S. That says nothing about spades. It simply tells the reverser we are in a game forcing auction.|mb|2S|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |

West: Would you double with my hand as a lead directing double? And I do not know whether I would be on lead as yet.|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You could, but you already told partner you have spades with your double and as you mentioned the declarer is unknown. Therefore, a pass is a reasonable call for you.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3NT is fine. But so is 2NT. Perhaps we have a slam. So going slow is better. Remember now that I bid 4th Suit Forcing, we are in a game force. 2N is slightly better, but unlikely to make a difference.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's help declarer by counting her tricks. North has 2 spade tricks, 2 heart tricks, and 2 club tricks for sure. So she needs 3 more tricks. If she plays a diamond, as she did she is guaranteed to make 9 tricks. But let me suggest a try for 10 tricks.|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is no danger of going down. There is only 1 spade remaining. If North plays the @CA, @CK, and @CJ. If East has the @CQ and wins the trick East won't be able to return a spade and North will makes 10 tricks. |
pg| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But if you play hearts first you will establish a heart trick for their side and won't be able to try the club play. So playing clubs first either makes no difference or might get you an extra trick. I will give you an undo so you can lead the top clubs.|up||

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Play:
West leads the @SJ against our game contract, probably from a sequence, and we take a time-out for reflection. |
PG| ***** 141 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We appear to be able to count nine winners (three Spades and six Diamonds) but there is a problem with entries. The lead leaves us in hand with the Diamonds blocked by dummy's @DA K with no obvious way back to the closed hand. |
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We cannot create a second entry to our hand but there is a way to unblock the Diamonds, although it is radical. We need to play the @SA K, before we play the Diamonds, discarding the @DA K from dummy! It may feel strange but it is essential; in fact it is the only winning line. |
PG| ***** 143 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In detail: we win the lead in hand with the @SQ. We next play the @SA discarding the @DK from dummy. The Diamonds are still blocked so we play the @SK discarding the @DA from dummy. |
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Partner is giving us quizzical looks as this is going on. No matter - a smile will appear on his features shortly.|
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The hard work is done. We have three tricks in the bank and all that remains is to cash our six Diamond winners and make our contract. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand was misplanned and it was lucky that it made. The only reason it did is because East inadvertently got endplayed and had to set up a 2nd diamond trick in dummy.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When planning a hand, unlike what was recommended, you should count winners not losers. Despite having only 4 losers, failure to count winners meant that declarer's plan only guaranteed 8 tricks. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand you have 7 top winners -- 4 hearts, 1 diamond, and 2 clubs. You can get 2 more winners by ruffing 2 diamonds in dummy. So that's how you should play the hand, planning to ruff 2 diamonds in dummy, not 1 as was done on the hand.|
