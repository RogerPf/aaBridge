^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although it is counter intuitive, West should make a |CP|1|fp|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dont,DONT^*N|CP||fp||at| double, showing a 6-card suit. "But West only has 3 HCP" you say. That is actually a good thing, believe it or not. The reason being, since South passed, the points are more or less evenly spread between the 2 sides. That means East must have a fair number of points.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


NT|^B@2
And, since East is sitting behind the strong hand, most of the finesses are going to work for West. The bottom line is, the weaker you are in 4th seat after it goes 1N-P-P, the more you should want to balance if you have the right distribution. So a |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dont,DONT^*N|CP||FP||at| bid here is appropriate.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A good illustration of why the West balancing with a weak hand often works out. Note that even if at trick three  North plays the @SA, we just trade tricks. The hand always makes 2 so long as she leads a spade at trick 2. West then simply pitches a heart on the @SK.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The important point to remember is you should strain to balance when it goes 1N-P-P and you have a hand with appropriate DONT distribution. Further, the weaker you are the better (hard as that is to believe).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That hand took a lot of planning as declarer. It took careful play and some luck to make 4. Let us find out whether it should be bid.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West has 12 |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=declarerpoints,Declarer Points^*N|CP||FP||at|.  9 HCP, -1 for dubuious @DJ, plus 1 length point, plus 2 points for singleton, and plus 1 point for side 4-card spade suit. So I would probably just invite game--3@H. I think pass by West was conservative.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Many players feel 3@H is invitational. But experts play it as simply competing. The idea being you are willing to compete to 3@H if North/South compete to 2@S or 3@C. So 3@H in a competitive auction is simply making it hard for North/South to compete.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore West, to invite game, has to bid something else, probably 3@C on her hand. Now let's count East's |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=dummypoints,Dummy Points^*N|CP||FP||at|. East has 14 Dummy Points. 13 HCP, less 1 for dubious @SQ, plus 1 for diamond quality suit and 1 for spade doubleton. 25-26 is the combined points and it is marginal as to whether or not to bid 4.

PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In Matchpoints I pass. Vul in IMPs I definitely bid 4 because the vul game bonus is worth a lot of IMPs, and you should bid 40% vul games in IMPs. Being not vul, it is a coin toss as to whether or not to bid 4 and, in fact, it is a coin toss as to whether or not it makes.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think double by East here is very clear. Double on that auction is not pure penalty. It just shows "cards." You can't be conservative when the opponents preempt. Otherwise they will steal you blind. West has an opening hand presumably because of the overcall and East has an opening hand, meaning their side has values for game.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Double just says "it is our hand partner, do something intelligent." On this particular hand East should hope for a pass, because of her 3.5 tricks (2 hearts, 1 spade, and likely diamond). You should count on partner for at least 2 whenever partner has opening values. That is not always true, but it is true more often than not.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |

mcannon: So the 4@H bid was just to keep us from bidding?|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Of course. Sometimes you don't know that. North could have a good hand and bid 4@H. But based on your hand you know that North is simply preempting.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


mb|P|NT||mb|4S|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As I said, the double is not a pure penalty. It does not necessarily show heart values. It asks partner to "Do something intelligent." With a balanced hand West would pass. But with a heart void and 6-4, West wants to play the hand, not defend particularly since she is a little light on HCP. So I would bid 4@S with the West hand. That should show 6-4.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out 4@H is down 3--lose 2 spades, 2 hearts, and 2 diamonds. But that is hard to know from West's perspective. The bidding was correct. It's just that our preempting forced East/West to guess what to do. Based on West's hand, she made the action that will work out best most of the time.  It didn't work out on this hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, you should not pass the double. Your hand being 6-4 and with a heart void screams offense not defense. If East had A of clubs instead of A of heart you easily make 5@C. And given the auction, that is much more likely.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When there is preemtive bidding you have to go with the odds. With the West hand, the odds heavily favor bidding rather than defending. It's not even close. No expert would pass a double by East and they would be right to bid the vast majority of the time.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In fact, they would be worried about missing a slam more than going down in 5@C. You can't play "results" bridge, meaning you can't regret the correct bid even if it doesn't work out.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I have a problem. if I knew they had an 8-card spade fit then by my competitive guidelines, I would bid 3@D because it is right to bid 3 over 2 when both sides have an 8-card fit. But I don't know that. And Jxx of spades is a bad holding in their suit--the worst. So because we are vul and they are not, I reluctantly pass.|

^*BMovie Maker: Howard played the remaining tricks and went down one. Of course he played it as he would have in live session without the benefit of looking at the other three hands. But because it was not claimed, the plays was not be saved and no record. Therefore, we got the assignment to replay and report back in this movie. So with the help from the porcupine lads, top bridge experts, we finished the play and made 9 tricks. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The hand turns out to be rather tricky to play. The line of play you chose is different and might even be better than the line of play I chose at the lesson. At trick 3, I think I chose to throw away a heart from dummy rather than ruffing high. It seemed likely that East would hold one diamond honor and be able to overruff dummy (although on the actual layout that is not true). But let's continue with your line of play.|
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You chose to ruff high which won the trick. You then played the @DA and DQ. When West wins and plays a heart, that is very advantageous for declarer and eliminates one of his 2 hear@t losers. However if West instead leads either black suit (either another spade or the @CQ), declarer will end up losing 2 more tricks. So, if West return the @CQ South wins and plays a diamond to dummy's @D9. Now South ends up having to lose 2 heart tricks no matter how he plays the suit.|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|By "looking at the dummy", the defenders can arrive at a starting strategy to set the hand. This is based on the fact that the declarer gets rid of losers by trumping them in the dummy or dumping them on dummy's long sit winners. Here we go.|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|With only 8 points of our own, and an almost-broke partner, we aren't too hopeful when this hand begins. Trick 1 however makes our ears perk up (picture a junkyard dog come to Alert). |
PG| ***** 184 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Pard plays the @H2 at trick 1. Is that attitude? Not hardly! Looking at the dummy, it's pretty clear what his attitude toward Hearts is. No. This is very likely a suit preference signal. He is taking advantage of an opportunity to tell us where he has some points.|
PG| ***** 185 ***** |


NT|^B@2
He is saying "my LOW discard means the LOWEST suit available." Trumps aren't available and neither are Hearts. That leaves the minors, and if he had Diamond possiblities, he would have played his highest Heart. |
PG| ***** 186 ***** |


NT|^B@2This is a fairly sophisticated concept, but it's a winner. If attitude (your default signal at trick 1) is moot, the card played by third hand is very likely to be suit preference. |
pg| ***** 187 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Now back to our central theme. We look at the dummy, and that is as dead as an old Corvair. Our plan is to go passive and not break any suits. |
PG| ***** 188 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Take a moment to look at the Clubs. Can you see how useful to the declarer it would be if WE broke the suit? We'd only get two tricks. By making the poor declarer do it, we harvest three. |
PG| ***** 189 ***** |


NT|^B@2
When we get on lead at trick 3, we go back to Hearts. Give them a trick they already have! |
PG| ***** 190 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The declarer plays out all his winners, praying for us to do something dumb. We don't (for once). Finally he has to break the Club suit and we (by playing "second hand low" BTW) take three tricks to go with our @SK. |
pg| ***** 191 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|There you have it. Look at the dummy, Dummy. It will help you set the contracts you should be setting. Long-suited dummy? Be aggressive and take your suits NOW. |
PG| ***** 192 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Short-suited dummy? Lead trumps to pull the declarer's teeth and reduce his chances of trumping in the dummy. Dead dummy? Can't see how the declarer is going to use the dummy? Go passive and either give them a trick that's already theirs or lead trumps. |
PG| ***** 193 ***** |

Does this always work? Please. BUT!! It's so much better to at least have a real strategy. |

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Here you have to decide whether or not to enter the fray after both opponents have bid.|

mb|1cp1d?|NT||lb|*bYour bid please.^^1s|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Your partner has Passed and both opponents have bid so what (on Earth) is the point of bidding 1@S here?|
PG| ***** 200 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Well... let's think. Firstly note the vitally important point that you have a very good suit.|
PG| ***** 201 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
1. Spades is top dog in bridge and you should strain to bid that suit. If partner likes Spades you have a fair chance of contesting the auction and of winning the battle to play the hand. Here, despite partner's silence so far, you still might win the auction (unlikely but possible).|
PG| ***** 202 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
2. You might be able to compete as a pair and push the opponents one level too high.|
PG| ***** 203 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
3. You are probably irritating the player on your left who might be about to rebid 1@H. Now he may have a much more difficult second bid.|
PG| ***** 204 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
4. You direct partner's (not always brilliant) attention towards a Spade lead should your left-hand opponent end up declaring the hand. Wouldn't you like a Spade lead?|
PG| ***** 205 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
When you have good Spades it's often worthwhile bidding them.|
PG| ***** 206 ***** |

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Partner has led a Spade. Well done, partner! (Actually, if he had led something else there would have been words. Short words, to be sure, but rude ones).|
PG| ***** 209 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Your overcall may have been brushed aside by the opponents in the auction but it certainly wasn't a waste of time. Definitely not! It directed the opening lead and that may well be worth a lot of money.|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Now, with a mere 9 points, should we be in the auction with a 1@S overcall? The answer is Yes, we should. Why? |
PG| ***** 218 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Well, we have the boss suit (Spades) and our suit is very good (@SK Q J x x is not to be sneezed at). Although it is unlikely that the hand belongs to our side it is still possible that it does. |
pg| ***** 219 ***** |


NT||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|If not, we may still be able to force the opponents overboard with some judicious "pushing". |
PG| ***** 220 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Last, but by no means least, a 1@S overcall alerts our partner to the fact that we would like him to lead a Spade, should West declare the hand. |
pg| ***** 221 ***** |


NT||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|As a corollary, we shouldn't overcall in these positions with a poor suit because, as sure as eggs is eggs, partner will lead that suit as soon as he can. |
PG| ***** 222 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Bidding a suit for the sole purpose of attracting the right opening lead is an important (and under-appreciated) part of the tactics of the game.|
pg| ***** 223 ***** |


NT||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|The play is oh-so-simple. If North were on lead to an uncontested auction he would probably lead a Heart (second choice, a Club, despite West having bid them). |
PG| ***** 224 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Once we have overcalled 1@S there is no choice. Well, the only choice is "Which Spade shall I lead?" rather than "Shall I lead a Spade?". |
PG| ***** 225 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Out comes the @S6 (top of a doubleton) and down goes the contract. The defence set up the Spades before West can get the Diamonds going – it's a classic tempo hand. A Club lead would give West an easy nine tricks and a Heart lead, you may note, would allow West to make (at least) ten tricks.|
PG| ***** 226 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As it is, West has no choice but to try the Diamond finesse after the @SA has been knocked out. We gleefully take the King and rattle off our remaining Spade winners.|
