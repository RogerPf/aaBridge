pg| ***** 22 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I prefer to play 2@D waiting. In fact, that is not considered negative unless you play steps or control responses, neither of which I recommend.|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, if you want to play 2@D as waiting and 2@H as negative (showing no aces or kings) that is ok. But I prefer what is called the "2nd negative" approach.|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The "2nd negative" approach works when after 2@D north bids 3@C (with no aces or kings) after I bid 2@H or 2@S. The 2@H bid as a negative is used by some pairs. I don't like that. Suppose opener's suit is hearts. Now the contract is wrong sided.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When you open 2@C you started the auction at the 2-level, you have "self preempted", and partner knows nothing other than you are strong. Using 2@D as waiting gives your partnership the most bidding room.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The advantage of the 3@C approach is opener gets to bid his hand naturally before finding out if responder has a bust or not. The only problem hand is when responder has a non-bust with natural clubs and no support for partner's major.|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


sk||nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In that case, sometimes responder has to bid 2NT with that hand. It's not a major deal as opener knows it is possible that responder has a non-bust with clubs. On this hand this entire discussion is irrelevant since I am bidding 2N (22-24).|sk||

pg| ***** 31 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once I lose the lead, they will cash 3 or 4 hearts (hopefully 3). But even if they can only cash 3 hearts, they can shift to a diamond and when I lose the lead a 2nd time they can cash some diamonds.|
pg| ***** 32 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I need one of the following 2 club distributions:
a) a singleton honor in one hand;

up|36|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand illustrates another good principle to know. And that is, when one hand has all the points, it is much harder to play the contract. A 22-point hand opposite a 2-point is much harder to play than 12 opposite 12.|
pg| ***** 45 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With 22 points opposite 2 you can never get to dummy to take any finesses. So when one hand is strong you need more total points to make the same contract. This hand would have been much easier if I took some of my points and gave them to north.|

nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even if east only has 6 points, they have at least 25 which is enough to be in game. And with a 6-card suit, I would accept the invitation with east's hand, especially in IMPs. I hate playing in 2N.|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It's only right if it makes exactly 2NT. So unless 2N makes exactly and 3N goes down you might as well be in 3N. The game bonus is worth a lot. It's a risk/reward thing.|
pg| ***** 51 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Say we have 5 spade tricks off the top but east has 9 or 10 points. East is going to bid 3N anyway and we are still going to take our spade tricks.|

pg| ***** 53 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Sure.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT|^^^B@2KIWI_2o1: My hand has 2 small spades and partner denied a 4+ card spades suit. Then, if east only has 3 spades with no stopper we need a 4-4 break to make 3N. And I will need lots of points in other suits from east. So 3NT looks marginal.|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a very good thought. Yes if east passes and has no spade stopper, west's bid (2NT) may work out (assuming we can only take 5 spades and nothing else). But I tend to look at it more optimistically.|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3N could easily be going down if North South have 5 spades off the top but so could 2N. On the other hand, 3N could be making easily. Therefore, I might as well go for the gusto and bid 3N.|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As I said it is just a matter of risk vs. reward. And being an optimist (which is a good bidding trait). I go for the reward.|

pc|S5|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is basically a 50% contract. If east can pick up clubs for no losers, he has 6 clubs 2 diamonds, 1 heart and 1 spade for 10 tricks. But if you blocked the suit, it would be back to the porcupines.|

^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes. You should strain to bid 1N any time you can't raise and have NT distribution. So you can bid 1N.|
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


mb|PP|nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Pass is reasonable. 2 other alternatives are 2@S and 2@D--(new minor forcing). I think 2@S is ok. But it is doubtful that, even if east has 3 spades that 4@S is making. As to whether to bid 2@S or pass 1N, either is fine.|
pg| ***** 79 ***** |


nt|^b@2^z@3^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In spades, west has ten declarer points. They are 10 HCP, -1 for dubious @DJx, + 1 length point. Even if east has a max (14 HCP) and a doubleton (15) they still only have 25 points. Not quite enough for game. And with only an 8-card fit, you should be conservative.|

Next let me reload the hand and show what happens if I overruff the 3rd round of spades.|

^-{You may now play this hand double dummy by clicking the cards you want to play. 
@C4 was the original lead. You can use different opening lead.

|FP|2|CP||AT|
It may actually be your hand. 

You can tell partner what to lead... often one he wouldn't normally make. 

Overcalls make it more difficult for the opponents to find the perfect contract when it isn't your hand.

That doesn't mean you overcall indiscriminately. 

You can't have both a bad hand and a bad suit!
