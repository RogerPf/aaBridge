cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North should strain to bid with an appropriate hand but unfortunately does not have one. Although, as you can see it does turn out we have a spade fit. So had he chosen to bid ^*b DONT ^*N^*g:dont::Competitive Bidding, (LINK  -  DONT)^*n ie: 2@D.  it would have worked out.|

PG| ***** 2 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Whenever it goes 1N-P-P-?, if you have appropriate DONT distribution (5-4 or a 6-card suit)  you should bid, even with few points. In fact, although this sounds counter intuitive, the fewer points you have the better.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Because the points are approximately even between the 2 sides. So if you have fewer points, partner has more and partner is sitting behind the strong hand. That means all finesses are likely to work.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North should not discard the @S9. Since I deliberately played the @SQ to unblock, he should go along with my defense and throw a red card instead. And discarding the @S9 does not really help him decide on a red suit discard. I am going to play my last spade and North will still have to discard a red card. My choice would be a diamond.|
PG| ***** 12 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As it turns out, the @S9 discard doesn't matter. Our side is going to take 2 more hearts and a diamond regardless of who is on lead. But North should still keep his spade and go along with the defense that South chose.|pc|H7|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us see what a good plan for East would have been. East has 5 tricks off the top--2 spades, 1 heart, 1 diamond, and 1 club. Theefore, needs two more tricks. One possibility for a trick is the club finesse. Another sur possibility is a 2nd diamond. Also hearts could be 3-3.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Probably what I would do is duck the first spade and win the 2nd spade. Then play @DA and low diamond. Win the 3rd spade and play another diamond. That gets you up to 6 tricks.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Eventually East probably has to rely on the club finesse which loses but you might try a couple of hearts first. In any case down 1 is the worst you should do.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Again, you need to make a plan before playing to trick 1. Count your winners and come up with a plan to generate enough winners to make your contract.|

And it turns out declarer can't make 3NT if North ducks the first diamond. Declarer can take at most 8 tricks -- the diamond just won, 5 clubs, and 2 hearts (with the heart finesse). Once North-South get in with the SA, they can take a lot of diamonds.|

What should East do? Double is certainly possible and probably what I would do. But keep this in mind in competition strong balanced hands are not as good as they look. Often you are better off defending than declaring.|

When I have a strong balanced hand the more balanced my hand, the more wi,lling I am to defend. Although, as everyone knows, I strongly believe in aggressive bidding. So here I might very well be willing to defend 1NT.|

PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT|^B@2
- 15 HCP and 2 length points (1 for clubs, 1 for spades). Normally West should deduct one for dubious @HK. But since partner bid hearts, it is no longer necessary to do so;
- 1 quality suit point;
- 2 points for singleton; and
- 1 point for side club suit.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Next, West has to decide how you want to play this auction by making a slam try. At this point East/West are not even in a game forcing auction. 3@C by West would simply be a game try (not a slam try) showing some club cards.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|Wrong card?
Suppose you play the ace and queen of spades at this stage, aiming to set up the @SJ for a discard and then cross to the @H8 to throw a diamond.|
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
You would survive most of the time but when spades were 6-2, West might win the second spade and allow his partner to ruff the established @SJ on the third round.|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
You can avoid this risk neatly by leading the @SQ instead of playing the @SA and @SQ.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|How to play:
When you can elicit no sign of life from partner, you settle for 6@H. How would you play the slam when West leads the @C10 to your ace and West shows out on the first trump? |
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It would be poor play to use the @H8 entry to take a spade finesse, since you would go down when West held the @SK.|
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The original declarer saw the chance to establish a discard on dummy's spades. Without drawing any more trumps, he continued with the @SA and @SQ. West won with the king and promptly returned a third round of spades. |
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It was not a pleasant moment for declarer when East ruffed dummy's @SJ, killing the chance to discard a diamond loser. Declarer overruffed but had nowhere to park a subsequently diamond loser. One down! |
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It was unlucky to find the spades 6-2. Since this was the main potential hurdle to be overcome, declarer might have planned how to leap over it. At trick three he should lead the @SQ, rather than the @SA and @SQ. He could then ruff the club return high, cash the @SA, draw trumps with the ace and eight and take a discard on the @SJ. |

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|This hand requires you to plan thoroughly at trick one (which you should be doing in every hand, right?) After you have formulated a sound Plan you can take your tricks, if you are sufficiently careful|
PG| ***** 154 ***** |

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|You have 6 points so you ought not to Pass (partner can have up to 19 points and, anyway, there is probably a better contract than 1@D).|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
You cannot bid at the two-level since that would promise 10+ points, and you also don't have a four-card suit to bid at the one-level.|
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
That only leaves the catch-all response of 1NT and that, by a process of elimination, should be your bid. It's a case of "what else?"|mb|1n|

NT|^B@2^*B
Spades: ^eThree top tricks;
Hearts: ^eNothing here;
Diamonds: ^eNothing much here either;
Clubs: ^eThree top tricks.^*N|
PG| ***** 162 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
So you have a bare six tricks on top. However, our old friend the long suit may come to your aid here. Assuming that Clubs are divided nicely how many Club tricks are available?|
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This assumes that Clubs are 2-2 or 3-1. A 4-0 Club split would blow your contract out of the water. For those of you who enjoy mathematics the chances of a 4-0 break are exactly 10%|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Play. 
West leads the @S10 against 3NT, which looks like being the top of a sequence. We can count nine top tricks (three Spades and six Clubs), assuming that both defenders have at least one Club. (Put another way: assuming Clubs split 2-2 or 3-1). |
PG| ***** 179 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The problem on this hand is being able to reach all the long Clubs and this requires some planning. (Have we ever mentioned about making a Plan?) To ensure we have an entry to the Clubs we must play the @SA from dummy to the first trick before we cash the top Clubs. |
PG| ***** 180 ***** |


NT|^B@2
[Try the effect of winning the first trick with the @SQ. Now try reaching the South hand later in the game...]|
PG| ***** 181 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
This then is the play... We take the first trick on table with the @SA. We then unblock the Clubs by playing the @CA K Q, being pleased to note that this exhausts the defenders' supply of Clubs. |
PG| ***** 182 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We now have four tricks and have five waiting (the @SK J and the @C9 7 6) in the closed hand. All we need to do is play the @SQ, making sure we overtake with the @SK and cash our winners. After that we have little interest in the deal – we have our nine tricks and don't care much that the defenders are feasting on the scraps. |
PG| ***** 183 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Note. With 20-20 hindsight and a view of all four hands the defenders could have beaten 3NT by leading a Diamond initially and by switching to Hearts. However, what West did was entirely reasonable: he led his longest suit. Had he led a Diamond initially there could well have been a stewards' enquiry...|
