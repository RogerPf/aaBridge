^-{          A Special Announcement by Howard          
}^-|
CS||fp||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|I just started a new audio visual lesson series called In Depth Bridge.
 
My first lesson is entitled "A Comprehensive Guide To Competing Over 1NT" which addresses how and when to compete over both strong and weak NT. 

Most players do not compete enough over a 1NT opener. In the lesson I will explain why it pays to aggressively compete.

The |CP|1|fp|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/audiolessonsib/ibaudiolessons.php^*N|CP||fp||at| link gives more details. 

There is also a demonstration lesson which I think most of you will find interesting.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had I not doubled, then west might try 6@D. But because I doubled 4@S, there is a good danger that west is going to lose 2 spade tricks.|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding hands with 9 card suits is difficult a) because they almost never come up and b) because it is hard to evaluate how strong they are. |
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What you have to do is what I call "picture" bidding when you have a long suit. You picture what partner needs in order for you to make game or slam. |
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this case, from west's perspective, all east needs is 2 aces in order for slam to make. This hand illustrates why counting points with the west hand is not useful. You need to count tricks when you have a hand with a long suit, not points.|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another important point is my double. Whenever you have a chance to make a lead directing double of an artificial bid, you should do so. East/West can make 6 with any lead other than a spade.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Finally, normally you should not bid Blackwood with a void because the ace in your void is not worth much. But sometimes you are stuck. What you need to do if forced to bid Blackwood with a void is assume that one of partner's aces is in your void, particularly if they have bid the suit.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If east had the @SA rather than the @CA, it make 6. But when east shows 1 ace, you have no way of knowing which ace.|
pg| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the double by north, generally speaking, takeout doubles should show opening points. A little less is ok. But 5 HCP is stretching quite a bit particularly since E/W have not yet established a fit.|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With 5 HCP and a singleton, even 1@S overcall is not a good call. In short north, the best bid at that situation was pass. If it went 1@D-P-2@D, then maybe you could double since, when they have a fit we have a fit. But even then, you need a few more points.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With 6-4 and 1 diamond it is clear to overcall rather than double. But even if I were 5-4-3-1 (5 spades, 4 hearts, 3 diamonds) I still advocate overcalling a 5-card suit rather than doubling.|mb|1S|

mb|P|mb|2S|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@S is acceptable. Having said that, north still has a 3@S call--weak. It's just standard competitive bridge. If north had a limit raise, she would cue bid 2@C|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


mb|3C|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now if you reversed my clubs and diamonds, I had 1 club and 2 diamonds, I would bid 4@S. I have 15 Starting Points--14 HCP. 2 length points, and -1 for @CQx. After counting the declarer add ons (2 for singleton, 1 for 6th spade once we find a fit, 1 for 4 card heart suit) my hand is worth 19 Declarer points. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if I had a singleton club, I would bid 4@S. But I am worried about 2 club losers and since pard only promised 6-9 it is hard to imagine a hand where we won't lose 2 more tricks. Nevertheless, I will make a game try in case pard has 8 or 9.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|5@C was not a bad call. Unfortunately, this turns out to be what is known as a "phantom sacrifice" because it turns out we can't make 4@S. 5@C turned a plus into a minus.|
PG| ***** 100 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It still was a reasonable bid had declarer held it to down 1 by first playing trump, and then leading a diamond and playing the @DJ if north plays low. No harm in doing that. If he had only gone for 100 instead of 300 then it wouldn't have been quite as bad because if we can make game, -100 is a great score. And if we can make 140 (which we can) -100 is still not bad. But -300 is not as good.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this particular board, because we can't make 4@S it is not a good sacrifice. But E/W have no way of knowing that. Therefore, 5@C by west given the vulnerability and the singleton spade was a reasonable risk. Sometimes you might even talk us into bidding 5@S which might go down.|
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In summary, 5@C had a lot going for it. If we make 4@S it's a good bid. It is a good bid if we are pushed to bidding 5@S and go down. It is not good only if we can't make 4@S and don't bid a losing 5@S. |

mb|3S|mb|4D|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@D is what is known as a "sacrifice suggestion." North is assuming they are bidding game and is saying he is not sure whether or not to bid 5@D. Personally, with the spade void, and favorable vul (we are not they are) I would just bid 5@D. But 4@D is a reasonable call as well.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|5 over 5 decisions are tough. With 6-4 and a likely 10-card spade fit I would have probably bid 5@S. But "5 over 5" is often the wrong thing to do.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|The hand can be defeated if East gives partner a heart ruff at trick 2. I am not sure I would have led the @HA. But once the @HA was led, and partner played the 7 and North played the 3 east should be able to work out the heart suit.|
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East could workout partner probably doesn't have 3, since she did not raise and the only missing hearts are the 9 and 8. Granted partner could have 3 but unlikely. And partner can't have a doubleton because partner did not high low, since the only remaining hearts are the 8 and the 9. Therefore, partner probably has a singleton.|
pg| ***** 124 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North should make it a little more confusing for east by not playing the @H3. North should play the @H8. That way, from east's perspective the 3 is missing, so partner could easily have 2 hearts--the @H73. Since north played the @H3, as most players would, the hand can be defeated by east giving partner a ruff.|
pg| ***** 125 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 5@S, E/W only have 2 losers. One diamond and one club. They take 7 hearts, 2 ruffs in the east hand, and 2 aces for 11 tricks.|
pg| ***** 126 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out this is a rare instance where "5 over 5" was the correct bid. 5 over 5 decisions are probably the most difficult decisions in bridge.|

Barbie1970: Could or should either east or west double? If affirmative which one in this bidding should double? |
pg| ***** 128 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Generally speaking, the person with shortness in the opponents suit makes the decision as to whether to double or bid on. In this case west has 2 likely diamond losers. On the other hand, as east with a singleton diamond and a 10+ card fit in spades, I probably would bid 5@S instead of doubling. But as I said, it's a hard decision either way.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|3NT is sometimes referred to as the 'bread-and-butter contract'. What on earth does that mean? It means that it is the most frequently-occurring contract and therefore the most important one to play well.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|There are two good reasons not to play dummy's @HK on the first trick. Can you think what they are?|
pg| ***** 174 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|The first reason is that East may hold the @HA. Suppose you play the @HK from dummy on the first trick and East began with @HA 10. He would win with the @HA and return the @H10. The defenders will score the first five tricks in Hearts!|
pg| ***** 175 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|The second reason is that playing the @HK may cost you the contract even when West holds the @HA. The @HK will win in that case but if a subsequent Diamond finesse fails, East may be able to return a Heart.|
pg| ***** 176 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|If West started with something like @HA J x x x, you would then lose four Hearts and the @DK.|

pc|sq|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|East holds @HQ 10, in fact, but he sees that it will not help the defence for him to return a Heart. You have a Heart stopper in dummy and West will not have an entry to enjoy the long cards in the suit. East tries his luck in Spades instead.|
