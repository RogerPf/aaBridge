^a@2Yes the 15-18 points in all the auctions are correct. Occasionally overcaller may be a bit stronger with 3N after 3 level pre-empt. But he needs solid stoppers for the opener's suit. Regardless responder, overcaller's partner, should not expect more than 15-18. There is one more NT overcall which is in the balancing seat. Let us look at it too.|

ht|u|at|^l@2An overcall in balancing seat promises a balanced hand with about 11-14 points and stopper.

PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Unlike most auctions, where new suits by responder are forcing, that does not apply after a 1NT overcall. In fact, new suits by responder are weak. Meaning, new suits by me are not forcing. They are in fact weak and show essentially a weak 2 in the suit bid. If I have a good hand I can double for penalty.|mb|2c|

What should you do if partner overcalls 1NT and the RHO passes.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


AT| The answer is very simple. You simply play "Front of Card" (FOC), referring to the section on responding to 1NT that appears on the ACBL Convention Card. Simply said, you use exactly the same methods you use when partner opens 1NT. They are you know:|

I have expert partners who still screw it up after many years of playing it. So systems on is better for most players unless you are a very experienced partnership who wish to study Lebensohl very thoroughly.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |

Let us go back to the table and advise West in her bidding.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT||st||sk|w|mb|2c?|lb|*yLet us ignore the bid by South. Is the West's hand good for a transfer to minor?^^y|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As a general rule, it is usually much harder to take nine tricks than seven tricks. And three of a minor requires that you take nine tricks whereas 1N requires you only have to take seven tricks. |
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Therefore, unless you are pretty sure you are going to take three more tricks in a minor-suit contract than in NT, you should not transfer. (If you take two more tricks in a minor-suit contract, you break even.) |
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So, how do you know if a minor-suit contract will yield three more tricks? Well, you don't. But here are some guidelines that work pretty well. If you have a 7-card minor and a weak hand, transfer. If you have a 6-card minor and shortness somewhere (a singleton or void) and a weak hand, transfer.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Otherwise, don't bother. By the way, this is essentially the same logic as to why you strongly prefer to play 3N as opposed to 5 of a minor. It is much easier to take nine tricks than eleven.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now that we determined West can transfer to a minor, let me explain the options available to her. Please note that we are ignoring Lebensohl and West is playing ^*Bsystem on/stolen bid doubles^*N.|

{  Simple Transfer to Minors  }
^-|fp||cp||
AT|^B@2
Most partnerships play Jacoby Transfers for major suits. However, interested players may use Jacoby Transfers for the minors as well. First, let me remind you the benefits of transfers in minors.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


AT|

In general, if you have a weak hand with a long suit opposite a strong hand, it is more desirable to play in the weak hand's suit because in that suit, the long cards will take tricks, whereas in another suit it may not be possible to score the low cards in the weak hand's long suit. The only trade off is you have to play at the three level, which is kind of high. However, given a weak hand with seven clubs or diamonds, the trade-off is worth it.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


AT|

Some partnerships play 2@S as a transfer to minors. Opener automatically responds 3@C. The partner bidding the transfer passes with clubs or corrects to 3@D. That is easier to play, but not quite as flexible. I recommend you start with this simpler transfer and then progress to the stronger and more flexible version which I will explain next. Let me first show you a few examples of the simple transfer to minors.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


AT|


^*BBTW, all "transfer bids" should be alerted. Further both "accepted" and "rejected" response bids by the NT opener should be alerted as these are additional information available to the partnership that opponents should be aware of. To economize his time, the Movie Maker has not included the alerts in the following examples. Please consider it done in every situation. In all example you are using 2@S to transfer to MINOR(s)^*N.|

NT||bt||
%%%%%%%%%
qx||ht|b|cs|1|cp|4|fp|1|at|^-{  4-Suit Jacoby Transfers - Transfer to Minors }
^-|fp||CP||CS||AT|^B@2
One variant of Jacoby Transfer that I use is 4-suit Jacoby transfer. A 2@S bid by responder is a transfer to clubs, and a 2NT bid is a transfer to diamonds. Since there are two bids between the transfer bid and the transfer suit, opener now has two choices. |
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


AT|

With good support (ONLY if you have 1 of the top 3 honors, regardless of the length of your support), opener "accepts" the transfer by bidding the suit (1NT-2@S-3@C or 1NT-2NT-3@d). BTW, Notrumper always has at least 2-card support.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


AT|
 
With less than good support, opener "rejects" the transfer by not bidding the transfer suit (1NT-2@S-2NT or 1NT-2NT-3@C). |
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


AT|

Again, this convention can be used for two purposes:
1. To allow the responder to bid 3NT with a 6-8 point hand and a 6-card minor suit if opener accepts the transfer. Otherwise, the contract will be 3 of the minor.

2. To play in 3 of a minor with 5 or fewer points and a 6-card minor.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


AT|

As an important clarification. If you play 4-suit Jacoby transfer you cannot make a 2NT invitational bid. In another word, 1N-P-2N is not invitational bid. In its place, you bid Stayman followed by 2NT. Now we have to 1NT bidder should be alert to the following:
^C1NT-2@C-2@S-2NT does not necessarily promise hearts and simply shows a 2N invite.
^C1NT-2@C-2@H-2N denies 4 spades by responder and simply shows a 2N invite. 
^B@2If responder bids Stayman with an invitational hand and 4 spades, he must bid 2@S when opener responds 2@H (e.g. the auction should go 1N-2@C-2@H-2@S).|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |

NT|^B@2
The problem with playing 4 way transfers is that it is easy to forget that 2N is not natural but a diamond transfer. For most less experienced pairs, you might play 2@S is a transfer to either minor. Had EW been playing that, West would bid 2@S, East would bid 3@C, and West would correct to 3@D.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4 way transfers, are slight superior, but it is easy to forget 2NT is a diamond transfer. I think most pairs are better off, to avoid bidding accidents, and play 2@S as a transfer to either minor. 2@S forces the NT bidder to bid 3@C, and responder passes with clubs or bids 3@D with diamonds.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good bidding and play by East. If responder rebids her suit at the 2-level that shows a weak hand with a 6-card suit. You should almost always pass. The only time you should not is if you have good 3-card support or doubleton honor support and a nice hand, 16 or 17.|
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Don't try to rescue partner even when you are short. If partner has a weak hand, you are better off playing in their long suit. Your high cards will always take tricks. But if her long suit is not trump, then her hand won't be worth many tricks.|

So, regardless of how many points you have, if you have distribution suitable to bid DONT (e.g. 5-4 or a 6-card suit), you should bid it. In fact, believe it or not, it is better if you are weaker than stronger. Because you are assuming that the points are approximately even.|
PG| ***** 127 ***** |

So if you have fewer points that means partner, who is behind the strong hand, has more points and your finesses are more likely to work. On this hand I am 5-4. Not only that but I have a singleton.|

^B@2^*BBarry Rigal: ^*N|cp||at|In fourth seat South has a standard 2NT opening, to show 20-22 points. Now North uses Stayman to find the 4-4 spade fit, and raises to game, which is a sign-off. South must Pass, since North would not make the simple raise if he had any slam interest. |
PG| ***** 231 ***** |


NT|^B@2
When the defenders lead a diamond against 4@S it looks natural to cross to dummy and take a trump finesse; but if you do that, the defenders might win then take a club ruff. Far better to cash three diamonds pitching clubs from dummy, then cross to a heart and take a trump finesse. |
PG| ***** 232 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The second piece of technique is to lead a a low trump to the jack, not to lead the ten from dummy; this play avoids losing two trump tricks unnecessarily when East has a singleton honor.  |
PG| ***** 233 ***** |


NT|^B@2
After the trump finesse loses and a heart comes back, NOW is the time to lead the @S10 so as to stay in dummy if trumps are 4-1. (Note: you might still recover from a 4-1 trump break if East has a 4-3-3-3 pattern, but not if you lead a low trump to your hand. |
PG| ***** 234 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A comparable trump position is K J 2 facing A 10 8 4 3 where low to the king then the jack picks up the 4-1 break onside). |

^B@2^*BPeter Bushby: ^*N|cp||at|Diamonds look the best source of your extra two tricks. If they split 3-2 the suit will yield two extra tricks whether the finesse works or not. |

NT|^B@2
Even if they split 4-1 you can surrender the fourth round provided the finesse works, thereby establishing your fifth Diamond as a winner and still making four Diamond tricks. What should you do now?|

^B@2^*BPeter Bushby: ^*N|cp||at|You should win the lead in hand and cash the @DA (it would be embarassing if you didn't and the @DQ was singleton on your left) before crossing to the @CK and take the Diamond finesse.|

^B@2^*BPeter Bushby: ^*N|cp||at|Hmm. Good news bad news. The finesse worked the Diamonds aren't breaking. |

NT||lb|*yDo you need to alter your plan?^^n|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPeter Bushby: ^*N|cp||at|No you don't. Your right hand opponent started with four Diamonds. Play off the @DK then surrender the fourth round. You will then have the last Diamond left as a winner.|

^B@2^*BPeter Bushby: ^*N|cp||at|You have the lead back and the rest of the tricks are yours. Cash your three remaining Clubs playing the @CA first (high from shortage) and discarding the @S8 on the last Club.|
PG| ***** 261 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Then all that remains is to cash the @SK, cross to the @CA and cash your last Diamond.|
