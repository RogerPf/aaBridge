^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is an interesting tactical question involved with North's choice of bids. What is the difference between North passing and then bidding 3@S as opposed to just bidding 3@S right away? There probably should be an agreement, but I am not sure what it should be.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I suspect bidding 3@S right away is stronger than bidding it later. Anyway, on this auction, I should assume that 3@S is slightly less than a limit raise. North has 3@C and 3@D cue bids to show a limit raise. You should probably differentiate between 3@C and 3@D but that takes a sophisticated partnership.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


mb|4D?|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I would take 3@S as less than a limit raise and let me count my |CP|1|fp|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=declarerpoints,Declarer Points^*N|CP||fp||at| in order to decide what should be my next bid.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I have 18 Declarer Points--13 HCP, 1 length point, 2 quality suit points, and 2 declarer points for 2 doubletons and a 4 card side suit.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If partner has 8 or so, we might have game. The question is, do I want to push them into 5@D. I have 2 aces. Also, I don't like my 2-2 in the minors. Partner may have one trick. That rates to be at least 3 losers, maybe 4.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Let's picture partner with the @HK and @SQ. He might not have that, but I need to figure out what to bid and picturing likely hands for partner is one way to do that. That means I probably have no spade losers or heart losers, since East likely has the @HQ if it is missing.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So the question is, do I have 4 or 3 minor suit losers. Partner would need the K or A in a minor suit for me to have only 3 losers in the minors. If partner has the K, the A must be onside. But given the auction that is more likely than not.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Therefore, with 2 aces, I am going to assume that we can beat 5@D and I am bidding 4@S. But it could be wrong.|mb|4S|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us discuss the bidding a bit more. Should West bid 2NT or preempt in clubs? I think 2NT is fine but I wouldn't hate 3@C or even 4@C or 4NT. 3@S by North was good. He doesn't love his 4-3-3-3 and only 7 HCP. But we do have a 9-card fit so he is protected by the Law of Total Tricks.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I would not have bid 4@D with the East hand for 2 reasons; a) you rate to only have an 8-card fit so you are not protected by the Law and b) you don't want to push us into 4@S. I would have passed. Having said that, the bid could have worked out well.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With the spade void, once pard freely bids 4@D I think West should bid 5@D. I would expect East to have 4 or 5 diamonds.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT|^B@2
jordymil: Why not 5@C?|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because East bid 4@D. East might have 3 clubs, but it is more likely 2 or 1. So there should be a 9-card or 10-card diamond fit but 8-card club fit.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not with the flat hand and relative shortness in the minors. East knows that West has a void in spades and still chose to double and that spades are breaking badly. So I think leaving the double in is fine. Remember, generally speaking, you want to declare when you have a void, especially in a known fit for the opponents.|

kirby2: Why double instead of bidding 5 of a minor?|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You only want to double when you have trump tricks. I think 5@D is a better bid by West. Turns out it is down 1, perhaps 2.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@D intended as a limit raise or better is wrong. 3@D in this sequence should be asking pard to bid 3N with a stopper. There is a big misconception that many players have about cue bids as raises. |
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You can only make a cue bid as a raise a) as your first bid and b) if you are responder or advancer (responder to overcaller). Otherwise, cue bids are usually stopper asking in NT. So since East opened, a cue bid is NOT a raise.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Remember, the idea behind cue bids is for responder to show the strength of their raise. Partner already knows opener has strength. Opener can bid 2@S, 3@S, or 4@S to show strength. There is no point in using a cue bid as a raise.|

PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT|^B@2
East's hand worth 20 Dummy Points--14 HCP, 1 length point, 1 quality suit point, and 4 points for the void (sine East has 4 spades). It is enough to bid 4@S but I would actually bid 4@D as a splinter. 3@S is an under bid. So either 4@S or 4@D.|mb|4d|

PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT|^B@2
When you plan the hand you need to count your winners and come up with a plan to get 10 winners. If spades are 3-1 even if West loses the spade king he can count 4 spade winners in his hand, 1 diamond ruff in dummy, 3 clubs and 2 hearts for 10 tricks.|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT|^B@2
His original line of drawing 2 rounds of trump was reasonable if, in fact spades break 2-2 or the @SQ is singleton, he might even make 5 or 6. But once spades are 4-0, he needs to reassess his plan. Let us follow that line.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me further discuss the bidding. There is a convention called Flannery 2@D which I think is an incredibly dumb convention. But it does work well for the specific hand that West held. I definitely recommend against playing it.|
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you play it, the 2@D shows 4 spades, 5 hearts and 11-15 HCP which is what West had. And on the hand where you have exactly 4 spades, 5 hearts, and 2-2 in the minors and you open 1@H and partner bids 1NT, Flannery is the slightly better alternative. But that happens once a year.|
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So why give up 2@D as a weak 2 for something else that occurs infrequently. In such cases just bid 2@C when that auction occurs and you have the 4-5-2-2 hand. It will almost always work out fine as it did here. Most of the time partner bids 2@H and you end up in your 5-2 fit.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As far as East is concerned, once she bids 1N and then bids a new suit, that shows essentially a weak 2 in that suit and is to play. I didn't mind the 2@D bid with the misfit in hearts. But if East wanted to bid 3@D to show a quality 6-card suit and 10 or 11 HCP, that would have been fine as well. In either case West would have passed.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now since the 6 is missing, I would suspect that partner correctly led back her remaining count (high from the remaining doubleton) and therefore declarer only has the singleton @HA remaining. I couldn't be certain from the carding because maybe declarer was being tricky but I am certain based on the bidding.|
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


NT|^B@2
East did not bid 1@H but rather 1NT so east should not have 4 hearts. Remember on defense you have to get your clues from the bidding as well as the play. And often what someone DID NOT bid is just as informative as what they did bid. That is known as a "negative inference" and is very important to defending correctly. On this hand the fact that East did not bid 1@H is significant.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|With such good spades and diamonds you don't really need much from partner to make a game. Just the @SQ and the @CK (hoping the @CA is onside) and that's only five points!|
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Thus, you can just jump to game yourself. If you're thinking about bidding 3@D, don't! Given that you have the @DA, K and Q, do you think partner will like his diamonds?|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Interesting collection. No matter, better start counting your tricks and your losers etc. Plan your play.|
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On this opening lead, it appears that you have a heart loser, two club losers, and possibly a spade loser. Uh-oh, not looking too good. |
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Who knows, let's play on a bit further to see what develops. Sometimes the opponents don't exactly defend perfectly. For now, you just know that if the opponents cash two clubs next, you will have to play the spades for no loser. Any thoughts on how?|
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


NT|^B@2
There are a few options. You can play for someone to have @SQ J bare (highly unlikely, but not impossible), pick up @SQ J x with East via a double finesse, or maybe even if spades are 1-4 with your LH opponent having a singleton honor.|
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Anyway, now that you know how to defend if the opponents cashes the clubs, let's see if they actually find that defense.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Hmm. That's a bit of a surprise. Now this changes the ball game entirely. There is now the possibility that we can do something with the heart suit to shed away one or two of our club losers. To do this, we must find then @HQ. Who on Earth has it?|
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It's time to think outside the box and count some points! Firstly let's ask ourselves, why didn't West switch to a club? Rather than asking why West didn't switch to a club, we can instead work out what club holdings West would have in order to switch to a club. |
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Well, if West has the top two clubs (@CA and @CK) then that would be a clear switch. Actually, that would be a clearer opening lead than a switch! What if West has only one club honor? |
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If West only has the club ace, then it would also be clear to switch to a club. After the @HA lead, West can see that dummy's hearts are quite threatening, and as a result, he would (should) cash the @CA to hopefully get an encouraging signal from his partner.|
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With that logic, we can determine that West has the @CK as his only club honor. It wouldn't be unreasonable for him to switch to a diamond holding only the @CK for the fear that we might hold the ace. Also, West cannot have zero club honors - he opened the bidding so he must have points somewhere! |
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With the analysis given above, can you locate the whereabouts of the @HQ?|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|You can now see that you will have to lose a spade. That means you now definitely need to find the @HQ for a club discard. The most 'obvious' way to do that is to finesse with dummy's @H10. Can you still make your contract if your RH opponent has the @HQ?|
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Sure you can. You play a heart to the king, run dummy's @HJ for a ruffing finesse (you know West has three cards in hearts from the support double in the auction). The question still remains, how will you play the heart suit now?|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding: 
West opens 1@C to which East responds with 1@C. East's hand is not exactly the world, but sometimes it is reasonable to respond when you hold an ace. You, as South overcall 1@S as West makes a support double, showing three card heart support.|
PG| ***** 174 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now here is where partner made the "dodgy" 2@S raise. It might seem like a "courtesy raise" but in actual fact. when most or all of the strength of partner's hand are in the opponents' suits, it is best to Pass before partner gets too excited. |
PG| ***** 175 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That is what happens on this deal as South holds such a powerful hand that did not require an invitational bid. With such good spades and diamonds, you only need the @SQ and the @CK for game to be a good bet (hoping @CA to be onside) and that's usually not enough for a 2@S raise! |
PG| ***** 176 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you're thinking about bidding 3@D as a natural game try, don't! With the @DA K Q, do you think your partner will ever like his holding in diamonds? |
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Play: 
On the @HA opening lead, there are a few things that you can think of as dummy is placed on the table. Yes, we know that partner does not have the best dummy in the world but we can see that our contract is in a bit of a danger. |
PG| ***** 178 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You can see that there's a heart loser, two club losers, and possibly a spade loser. If the opponents cash two clubs next, it means you would need to pick up the spade suit for no loser. There are a few options where this might be possible.|
PG| ***** 179 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You can play for someone to have @SQ J bare (highly unlikely, but not impossible), pick up @SQ J x with East via a double finesse, or maybe even if spades 1-4 with your LH opponent have a singleton honor by laying down the @SA, cross to dummy two times to finesse against East. |
PG| ***** 180 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Anyway, that's assuming the opponents will find that defense. In fact, West cannot be sure where the defensive assets lie and decides to switch to a diamond. We are all human after all, so you can't always rely on your opponents defending perfectly all of the time!|
PG| ***** 181 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The diamond switch catches you off guard for a bit, but before you play on you should realize that this changes the ball game entirely. There is now the possibility that we can do make use of the heart suit to discard a club or two from our hand. To do this, we must find the @HQ. |
PG| ***** 182 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You can begin this task by firstly asking yourself, why didn't West switch to a club? Rather than asking why West didn't switch to a club, we can instead work out what club holdings West would have in order to switch to a club. |
PG| ***** 183 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Well, if West has the top two clubs (@CA and @CK) then that would be a clear switch. Actually, that would be a clearer opening lead than a switch! What if West has only one club honor? |
PG| ***** 184 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If West only has the club ace, then it would also be clear to switch to a club. After the @HA lead, West can see that dummy's hearts are quite threatening, and as a result, he would (should) cash the @CA to hopefully get an encouraging signal from his partner. |
PG| ***** 185 ***** |


NT|^B@2

Based on this logic, we can then determine that West has the @CK as his only club honor. He didn't switch to a club for the fear that we might hold the ace. |
PG| ***** 186 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Is it possible for West to hold no club honors? No, that is quite impossible - he opened the bidding so he must have points somewhere! |
PG| ***** 187 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Your thinking shouldn't stop there. We can now start placing cards with West. We know West has the @HA and the @CK so far. It's likely that West will have a spade card so let's place him with the @SQ as the worst-case scenario. |
PG| ***** 188 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With only 9 points it would be nowhere near enough for West to have opened the bidding. Let's give West the @CJ, and that's still not enough! Therefore, in order to account for the 1@C opening bid, we can conclude that West must have the @HQ. |
PG| ***** 189 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Accordingly, you win the diamond switch, draw two rounds of trumps to confirm your analysis as East drops the @SJ (East also needs some points to have responded 1@H!), finesse in hearts and discard two clubs on dummy's good hearts. |
PG| ***** 190 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Was it possible to have made the contract, hypothetically speaking, if East held the @HQ? |
PG| ***** 191 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Sure you can. You play a heart to the king, run dummy's @HJ for a ruffing finesse (you know West has three cards in hearts from the support double in the auction).  |
PG| ***** 192 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If East ducks you simply discard a club and the most you'll lose is a spade, a heart, and a club. If East covers you ruff, cross to dummy with the @DJ and play the winning heart as you discard a club. West is welcome to ruff this but you will have traded a loser for a loser. |
PG| ***** 193 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On a new note, this hand illustrates a defensive principle. Given the bidding, the lead, and the heart strength in dummy, East's play at trick one should be suit preference, not attitude. After all, West already knows how East must feel about hearts!|
PG| ***** 194 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If that agreement is in place, West will shift to a club at trick two and defeat the contract. |

NT|^B@2
You have two in Spades, two in Hearts, one in Diamonds and none in Clubs. That is a total of five, so you will need four more from somewhere. The Club suit will give you five extra tricks (one more than you need), once you have knocked out the defenders' @CA. |
