UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss the defense now. First of all, the Movie Maker, having recently given us a nice article in the first Movie of this month on |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*gGoz:mentoring1712a,"Garozzo's Rule."^*N|CP||FP||at|   (You can later return here using the  @l  arrow next to the  @z  icon).
^^In brief - the Rule is that you should almost always lead a singleton against a suit contract.  So East should have led his singleton heart.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But the @DA is not a bad 2nd choice. However then he should have switched to either a spade or a heart--probably a spade. Let declarer play the hand out. The other comment was about the club play when declarer was in dummy there was no reason to ruff a heart since that was the last time declarer was in dummy, might as well try for a club trick.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When I am missing both the Queen and the Ace and I have no information as to who holds which card, I always finesse for the queen. So, at trick eight, I would have played the @C10 from hand. But, the @CK is just as good a play. The odds are 50-50. In fact, since East is known to have started with the @DAK having the @CA would give East 11 HCP. That is not quite an opening hand, but if East had another honor or 2 he would have opened. |
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, I would say, if anything, it is more likely West had the @CA although only slightly. So the @CK is probably the better play on this particular hand. But in general I prefer to finesse the Queen when missing both honors. That way I am right 50% of the time.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First the auction. Should I overcall 1NT?|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


AT| I do have slightly off shape distribution 5-4-2-2 and I do believe that, in general, you should not open 1NT with 2 doubletons. However, overcalling 1NT is a different matter. Since overcalls are a very imprecise description of your hand you need to be a little more flexible when overcalling 1NT.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because the 1NT overcall give a very good description of your hand. So if you have anything resembling a 15-18 balanced hand, with a stopper in opener's suit, it is ok to overcall 1NT, as that gives partner a good idea of what your side's assets and likely contract should be.|

Whenever you are 5-6 (e.g. the 6-card suit is lower ranking) you should tend to open in your 6-card suit, intending to rebid your 5-card suit twice to show your distribution. One might argue, if I bid 1@S after, then 2@H is a reverse and therefore an overbid. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But I would argue that any hand with 12+ HCP and 5-6 distribution is worth a reverse particularly when it gets your distribution across. However, some players would open the North hand 1@H, although I disagree (but not vehemently).|

PG| ***** 105 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding needs discussion. 1@D by East is not the best bid for a couple of reasons.|
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|a) East only has a 4-card suit but b) more importantly, East is too strong to make a simple overcall. Normally with that hand I would think about 1NT. But the hand is even too strong for that with 19 HCP.|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So what you do is "double and correct" to 1NT to show a hand too strong to overcall 1NT.|
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's say the auction started 1@C-dbl-P-1@S-P-? (not on this hand but just for instance). In that case when East now bids 1NT partner knows East started with 19-20 or so, NT distribution but too strong to overcall 1NT. |
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is because of the "double and correct" to NT. Of course, if West bid hearts rather than spades e.g. the auction started 1@C-dbl-P-1@H-P-?, then East should bid 3@H to show her hand.|
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West given the 1D overcall should bid 3@D not 2@D. In fact 4D is not out of the question. With a 10-card fit (supposedly since West is showing 5 diamonds). But with a flat 5-3-3-2 hand I think 3@D is fine while 2D is definitely an underbid.|

mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|lb|*bBid for North.^^2h|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's count North's dummy points. 7 HCP, 2 length points, 3 points for the singleton, 1 point for the void. That totals 13. That is probably a bit of an over evaluation, but the North hand is certainly worth at least a limit raise. So 2@H is a reasonable choice. The other choice is 4@S.|mb|2H|
pg| ***** 115 ***** |


mb|D|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over 2@H, despite being vulnerable, I think East should bid 3@H. East has a wonderful 7-4 hand, with a quality club suit in addition to nice hearts. Double does not do the hand justice.|
PG| ***** 116 ***** |


mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once East doubles, that gives South the additional option of passing. (Had East not doubled, South obviously must bid over the 2@H cue bid.) What are the meanings of South's various alternatives? |
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The weakest bid South can make is 2@S. That says he has a minimum 1@S overcall. A 3@S bid is invitational, showing approximately opening values, and asking North to bid 4@S with 12+ dummy points. 4@S is to play. |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A new suit is also invitational, showing strength in the new suit (although not promising 4+-card length). It asks North to bid 4 with a good limit raise and some values in the new suit. |
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So what does pass mean? It shows a moderate overcall (11 ish points) and shows mild game interest at best. However, the most important thing to note is that pass is a stronger bid than 2@S.|
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


mb|P|mb|2S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Over the pass, 2@S is reasonable by North. But I would not hate 3@S either, showing a good limit raise.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


mb|3H|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't like the 3@H bid by East. That is inconsistent. If she was going to bid 3@H over 2@S, then she might as well bid it immediately. All doubling first does is give North/South the ability to exchange additional information. So there is no upside to doubling, and some downside.|

mb|P|mb|P?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|lb|*bBid for North.^^p|mb|3S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What should North do over 3@H? That is an interesting question. 3@S is right if North assumes the opponents are going to let his side play it there. It definitely follows the Law of Total Tricks. |
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The problem is more a tactical one. Is North going to be happy if East bids 4@H? Probably not. So pass should be considered. And, in fact on this hand, it turns out to work out since East-West can make 4@H.|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


mb|4H|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@H is a reasonable bid by East, although it could work out badly given the vulnerability. East has 2 probable losers in diamonds and spades. Even assuming no club losers, it is very possible East is losing 2 or (if unlucky) 3 heart tricks. So down 1 is the most likely result. However, as it turns out, 4@H makes.|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And 4@H does give South a problem. 4@H could be down. South has 2 likely tricks, and North could easily have 2 tricks. But, whenever you have a 9+ card spade fit, 4@S over 4@H is usually right. So going with the odds, I like the 4@S bid, which does turn out to be South's best choice.|mb|4S|
