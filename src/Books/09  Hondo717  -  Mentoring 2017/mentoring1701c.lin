^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to whether East should double or not is a good question. I like it, letting us play at the 2-level in an 8-card fit is not a good idea. So doubling in the balancing seat is fine.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2NT is OK. 3@C is another alternative. The problem with 2N is that if East is weakish you could be in 2N with 20 or 21 HCP.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Best West can do is down 1 or 2. She needs to count her tricks, but that is hard on this hand. 3 hearts off the top is all she has. I like playing diamonds next, but a low diamond towards the J10 is probably best. |
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That will lose to the @DK. Another heart will come back then she has to decide whether to play another diamond. If she plays diamonds, since they don't break 3-3, she ends up taking 3 hearts, 1 club, 1 diamond, and a spade or 2. So down 2 at worst. down 1 if she plays spades.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 2@H, we lose 1 spade, 3 hearts, and 1 club. However, we have to do something with North's clubs. So I suspect we won't be able to ruff more than 1 club and might either make or go down 1. It depends on the defense.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT|^B@2
East's balancing double was correct. In general, if you let them play in an 8-card fit at the 2 level when the points are evenly spread, you will not get a good result. And there is a good chance from North's perspective that their side can end up in 2@S in their own 8-card fit. Just because a particular hand does not work out, does not mean you bid incorrectly.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The infamous "double dummy" analysis sheets they give you in live games would tell you you should make 6 spades.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT|^B@2
They would be right in the sense that 6@S makes. But wrong in the sense that you should bid 6. Sometimes they say you can make a contract by making a non-standard play.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT|^B@2
For example, suppose I decided to finesse West for the SQ and East had the doubleton @SQ. The double dummy analyzer would say I should make 6 because it knows, looking at all the hands, I can drop the @SQ.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That is the wrong way to play the suit. The right way to play the spade suit is the way I played it. Finessing West for the @SQ in case they were 4-1 giving myself an extra chance.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West does have a nice hand for only 10 HCP, but I still would pass as it doesn't meet the rule of 20. You can't count length points. The rule of 20 counts length points for you--the length of your 2 longest suits.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you want to use Bergen hand evaluation, you can and should, you use the slight modification of ignoring the length points when doing the rule of 20 calcualtion.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You count HCP, quality suit points, dubious shortness, and adjust 3 (for a/10 or q/j). So West has has10 HCP + 9 in 2 longest suits = 19.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Lets discuss the auction first.
Should East bid 3@C?|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On the plus side, she has a nice 6 card suit and favorable vulnerability (their side not vul, our side vul). On the minus side, East has no singletons or voids. Shortness is very important when playing in a suit contract. Hands with singletons and voids play much better than hands without them.|
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So if you are deciding to compete or not, one of the very important things you look at is the distribution of your non-long suits. If they are the flattest they can be (e.g. 3-2-2 on when you have a 6-card suit) that is a big minus. The more distributional you are, the more you like your hand.|

A 6-3-3-2 is an undesirable distribution. 6-3-3-1 is better and 6-4-2-1 is even better. Therefore, for multiple concerns, I probably would not bid 3@C with the East hand although it could work out. I would pass over 2@D. |
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, if North subsequently passed my 2@H bid then I might come in with 3@C because now he/she knows that the points are somewhat evenly distributed.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Sometimes waiting is not as good as coming in right away. In fact, in general it is better to bid than to wait. If you wait you give the opponents more room to communicate. But in this case, since it's not clear whether or not to compete I would have waited.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East probably is down 2 in 3@C. Losing 1 spade, 1 heart, 2 diamonds, and 2 clubs.|
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Should North pull the double?|
pg| ***** 137 ***** |


AT| That is not clear either. He does have 1 trick and that is all I have a right to expect. His club shortness, although normally good on offense is a liability here since my double shows club cards.|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In Matchpoints I think he has a clear pass because if we beat it 2 we get a top board. And if we beat it 1, its not clear if we can make 2@H. But in IMPs its more dangerous. If 3@C makes thats a game for them, because of the double, and a very bad result for us.|
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Personally I would have passed 3@C figuring its not my fault if partner doesn't have enough to beat them, e.g. the old "pass the blame" bid. On the other hand,  bidding 3@H in IMPs has merit. It is another example why it is better to bid aggressively than not. Players worry too much about getting doubled and going down.|
PG| ***** 140 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But lots of times, even if that is theoretically possible, as on this hand, it doesn't happen in real life (again as this hand demonstrates). So "bid early bid often" is the way to go -:).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out small slam is about a 50% contract. Whenever you have a 9 card fit missing the queen and not the jack the odds of either a 2-2 break, or the queen dropping are 50%. Same as taking the finesse.|
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


NT|^B@2
50% small slams are OK to be in but OK to not be in as well. 50% is the break even point for a small slam. In general I would avoid a small slam if you know it is 50% at best.  A grand slam should not be bid unless it is almost a sure thing e.g. you can count 13 tricks.|
PG| ***** 162 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It needs to be about a 70% proposition. So a grand slam on a 3-2 break (68%) is OK but just barely. The reason being, if you can make a small slam but go down in the grand slam, you not only have the penalty for going down but you lost the opportunity to score a lot of points by making 6.|
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So as I have said before "if you never bid a grand slam, you will come out ahead in the long run.|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Pard's lead promises the @HJ and denies the @HK. We need five tricks to set them. Questions for the defenders (that would be us):|
PG| ***** 173 ***** |


NT|^B@2
1. How many points does Pard have? The declarer?
2. How many tricks can you see for us?
3. How is the declarer going to use the dummy?|
PG| ***** 174 ***** |


NT|^B@2
4. Where can we get more tricks?
5. What should we do at trick 1? Why?
6. What should we do at trick 2? Why?|
PG| ***** 175 ***** |


NT|^B@2
1. We've got 8, dummy has 8, pard opened 13-ish, so declarer 11-12ish.
2. A mystery right now. We've got maybe two Heart tricks, no Clubs or Spades. We'll have to focus on Diamonds.|
PG| ***** 176 ***** |


NT|^B@2
3. If ever there was a dummy designed to dump stuff on, that's it. If Pard would have the @CK, it's puppy chow. Losers are going to be dropped on Clubs. That means we need to be aggressive and grab our tricks now.|
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


NT|^B@2
4. We should grab the lead with our @HA for two reasons. Firstly, we might drop the @HK. Declarer should be short. He has the @HK for sure. Secondly, we need to gain our tempo. We need to be aggressive.|
