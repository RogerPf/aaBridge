^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North hand does not meet the rule of 20. I think it is wrong to open all balanced hands with 11 HCP (e.g. 4-4-3-2 or 4-3-3-3 distribution). Balanced hands in general, even strong ones, are not nearly as good as their HCP indicate.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Similarly distributional hands are much better than their HCP indicate. For example on this deal, I much prefer the West hand to the North hand even though the North hand has 1 more HCP.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I would open the West hand, optionally in 1st and 2nd seat, and definitely in 3rd and 4th seat. It meets the rule of 20. However, I am a little more cautious about opening rule of 20 hands with 10 HCP or fewer. |
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I usually will but, particularly if my HCP are quacky, or my HCP are in my short suits, I sometimes won't open them in 1st and 2nd seat. In this case, the West hand is a really nice 10 HCP so I would open it.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Factors that cause you to upgrade your hand are points most in aces and kings and when your points are in your long suits.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


NT|^B@2
For example @SAQxxx @HAxxxx @Dx @Cxx is much better than the following @SQxxxx @Hxxxxx @DA @CAx. Same 10 HCP, but the singleton and doubleton aces are much worse than when the aces were in the long suits.|

But even if you play that, the East hand is worth more than 15 HCP. The quality suit and 3 quick tricks are very nice. So I would bid 3@S even with the 15 HCP.|mb|3S|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So in that case you still count ^*bDeclarer^*N Points. even though you are dummy. West has 10 HCP, 2 length points, 2 points for the singleton, and 1 point for the side 4+ card heart suit. That's 15 ^*bDeclarer Points^*N.|

Since East has at most 17 slam is unlikely. So 4@S is the best bid. but the West hand is close to trying for slam and it should not be a big surprise if it made.|mb|4S|

Bottom line is, generally speaking, use the law of total tricks to figure out if and how much to raise partner. Occasionally, if you have a very good hand and if you can count 10 tricks with that holding, then you should raise to game. Otherwise just use the law.|

^-|cs||fp||ht|e|cp|8|AT|^B@2^Y@3^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|At golf, I usually shoot in the mid 80's.  Occasionally, I go into a funk/slump and can't hit the ball. I hit ground balls, I hit it out of bounds. Ugh.  I know I am better than that. How do I get out of it?  I used to do it with lessons.  They worked for a while, but then, inevitably, I'd be back in the same slump.|
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


AT|

Eventually, I decided to write down a few key thoughts. Whenever I am slumping, I take out the printed list and read it. Usually one or two of the items listed do the trick for me. Typically, I have forgotten my basics. Something as simple/basic as: "Slow down the tempo" or "Make sure you follow through" or "Make sure you have your eyes on the ball as you hit it" will get me back in form.|
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


AT|

In bridge, players also go into slumps. Sometimes, it is just a matter of bad luck--not much you can do about that. The luck will even out. Really. But, most slumps are caused by losing track of the basics. Here is my little "checklist" for things you might try to get back in form. Maybe one or two of these will do the job for you.|

1) As declarer, make sure you are planning at trick one before playing. Are you playing too quickly to the first trick? Here is my formulaic thinking (do it every single time dummy comes down) for both notrump and suit play:|
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


AT|

A) NOTRUMP -- Count your sure winners. Identify the suit(s) you will set up to create more tricks. Ask what will happen when you lose the lead. "When I knock out their @SA to set up my diamonds, what damage will they do--what is my stopper situation in their suit(s)?"|
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


AT|

B) SUIT CONTRACTS -- Look at the tricks you have to lose. You are in 4@S and they have led clubs. You have @CJx in dummy and @C10x in hand. You will lose 2 club tricks. You are also missing the @SA. You can't lose any other tricks or you will go down. In hearts, you have @HAKx opposite @HJxx. If you don't figure out some plan for that likely third-round heart loser, you will go down. Ask yourself what you can do to get rid of losers. Can I set up a side suit? Can I trump a loser in dummy? Will I need a finesse? Can I put the opponents in to break a suit for me? Lastly, you must always ask yourself: "Should I draw trump now--or postpone it to do something else first."|

^B@2^Y@3^*BLarry Cohen: ^*N|cp||at|2) As defender, make sure you aren't dangerously breaking suits and helping declarer. Unless there is something about the bidding or in dummy which suggests you need to make a dangerous/attacking/risky/aggressive play, don't do it! Are you prematurely grabbing aces?  Aces are meant to capture kings.|

3) In the bidding, make sure you don't stop in a partscore when you know you belong in game. Your partner shows opening-bid values and you have opening-bid values--you must not stop in a partscore! Make sure every bid you make is forcing (until game is reached).|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


AT|

4) Doubles. Review the basics of negative doubles and takeout doubles (and responses). Auctions involving doubles come up many times a session. Getting those right is much more important than studying the latest fancy upside-down dragon convention.|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


AT|

5) Come to the table with a clear head. No big meals (or alcohol!) before playing. Be aware that if you are sleeping poorly or over-medicated, you can't expect to play at your best level. Go easy on yourself.|
PG| ***** 136 ***** |

6) Cut down on the conventions/methods. Try to play a very basic convention card with just the essential agreements. Filling your head with uncomfortable clutter and memory makes it hard to take tricks and remember what the contract is. Click |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.larryco.com/bridge-learning-center/detail/54^*N|CP||at| for my list of essentials. I could go on and on, but part of slump-busting is to try to keep it simple/basic. This list of 6 should be enough. Maybe one or two will do the job for you. Good luck!|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|There are six easy tricks to be had here - four Diamonds and two Clubs. If you can make four Spade tricks then 4@S would be done and dusted. Well, that's easy enough if the suit breaks 3-2. What if it doesn't?|

PG| ***** 151 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
What can he do? If he plays low, the @SJ scores and West makes his @SQ later. If he takes the @SQ then you can - in due course - draw the remaining trumps with the @SJ and the @SK.|
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
One trump loser only and four winners. What if West shows out, though...?|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Play:
In 4@S we have to play carefully to land even that. With a Club loser and a Heart loser it is essential not to lose two trump tricks. |
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If this Spade layout is unfamiliar, it's worth remembering for future deals. To make four Spade tricks, against any 4-1 break, we need to play the @SA and a low Spade to the @SJ. If either opponent is harboring @SQ 10 x x we can hold him to one trick and make four trump tricks.|
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


NT|^B@2
True, if trumps were 3-2 and someone held @SQ x we would concede an unnecessary trick. Well, that's a small price to pay for peace of mind.|
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In detail: We win the @CQ lead and play the @SA and a Spade to the @SJ. East takes the @SQ but his @S10 8 are now known to be underneath our @SK 9. When we regain the lead (with a top Club) we cross to dummy with a Diamond and finesse the trumps.|
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We are safe now for four Spade tricks, four Diamonds and two Clubs. The rest are just scraps for the bird-table.|
