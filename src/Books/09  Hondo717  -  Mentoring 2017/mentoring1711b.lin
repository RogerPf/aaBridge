UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|First the bidding. Some people play that they do not open a weak 2 with a 4-card major. Also some people play they don't open a weak 2 with a void. Their reasoning is they may miss a better fit if they do and they don't want to preempt partner.|
pg| ***** 19 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|So, since North has both a 4-card major and a void, those people would not open a weak 2. However, I prefer not putting such restrictions on my weak 2s. I think opening 2@D with the north hand is just fine.|
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|Should east overcall 3@C? Not really. I agree with East's pass. His club suit is only 5 cards long and it is not very good. Has only 1 honor and 1 intermediate. It has another downgrade that many players are not aware of.|
pg| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|The worst holding in an opponent's suit is 3 small. You could easily have 3 quick losers if partner is not short. So holding 3 small diamonds is another bad feature of the east hand.|
pg| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|As for the south hand, in general you should avoid bidding with a singleton in the weak 2 opener's suit as responder unless your hand is very strong. South's hand is not bad but it is not "very strong."|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|However, with the singleton being the @DA and a nice 6-card suit, I think 2@S is warranted. If north happens to have 3 spades or even honor doubleton 4@S might have plays. But I would not fault south for passing. 2@S is forcing. Asking to be raised with 3-card support or Ax or Kx.|
pg| ***** 24 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|A few play that 2@S is not forcing. That is what Marty Bergen recommends and what I prefer. But most play that 2@S is forcing. And even if not forcing, the weak 2 bidder is not obliged to pass.|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|Without any question, 2@S bid in this auction as forcing is standard. If you play it as not forcing, it should be alerted unless the alert rules have changed recently. I think, although the ACBL keeps changing the alert rules.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, the @HA was a good lead. But the best shift is probably a club. Then north ends up taking 6 diamonds and 2 clubs because of the 2 finesses and 2 hearts.|

mb|1C|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|The hand does not meet the rule of 20. 4-3-3-3 and a 12 count = 19 (12 + 7 in 2 longest suits). But does have some intermediates and 2 quick tricks. So some would open it. I would not (unless playing weak NT).|
pg| ***** 29 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|And regarding whether to open 1@C or 1@D, these days most people only open 1@D with 3 diamonds when they have exactly 4 spades, 4 hearts, 3 diamonds and 2 clubs. So 1@D almost always shows a 4+ card suit. If you play that, then east must open 1@C.|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|It used to be that many played they open "better minor." So when they were exactly 4-3-3-3 with a 4 card major they would open the minor in which they were stronger. In that case east would open 1@D. But 1@C is the standard these days.|

MB|?|NT|^z@3^b@2^^|lb|*bBid for south.^^P|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|Some might double with my hand, but not me. I prefer to be at least 4-3 in the majors. I have  a 4-3-3-3 hand, which I do not like and 12 HCP. If you want to deduct a point that would not be a bad idea. So I think pass is best.|mb|P|

mb|D|NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|Double is a nice bid by north.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


mb|2H|NT|^z@3^b@2^^|NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|I really want to bid but we only have a 7-card spade suit although we could have 8 diamonds. I don't know for sure that we do not to mention I have a lot of defense and we are vul. |
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|If playing with my wife Ava I might double which we play as penalty although most people play double by me as "responsive" meaning I want partner to pick their best suit.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|Actually I would only double playing Match Points not IMPs (for penalty) only if they were vul. If you are confident in your defense beating a part score one trick vul gives your side + 200 which is usually a top board, since any partial you can make is worth less than that. You get many tops that way.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, here I could make a responsive double since I am willing to play in 2@S even with a 7-card fit and I do have 2 honors in each of partner's suits.|mb|D|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


mb|P|mb|3D|NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|So assuming the double is responsive and west chooses not to bid north would bid 3@D. Length is more important than strength. So north should bid 3@D especially with short hearts.|

mb|1S|MB|X|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|Double is not a good choice. Double here. The problem is the singleton diamond. Partner is likely to bid diamonds (turns out not on this hand, but usually partner will) and then west is stuck for a bid.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|Remember a takeout double not only promises points but it also promises 3+ cards in all unbid suits. And if only one 4-card major, 95% of the time you should have 4 cards exactly in that major. |
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|Occasionally, with a Ax or Kx in one of the unbid minors and 4 cards in the unbid major I might venture a takeout double anyway. But that it is systemically incorrect. And if partner bids my doubleton I tell him or her "I meant to borrow another card from the last hand."|

mb|1S|mb|P|mb|2C|mb|P|NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|Let's discuss my options. I could decide this is a game forcing hand and bid 2@D as 4th suit game forcing. If I did that, let's assume north did not bid 2@S (which he won't on this hand). In that case, whatever north did bid (2N on this hand) I would rebid my spades (3@S on this hand). That promises 6 spades.|

NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|Why?|
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


AT|
Because north would bid 2@S with 3-card support over 2@D. So I know he doesn't have 3@S. Therefore a 3@S bid by me must be looking for 2-card support.|
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|The other alternative is for me to bid 3@S directly here. That is NOT 100% forcing although it is highly invitational. It shows just below a game forcing hand with 6 nice spades.|
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2Barbie1970: Why?|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^^^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|Because with a game forcing hand you bid 2@D first and rebid your spades, even with 6 spades, as I just explained. Whenever you can establish a game force at a low level you should do so, That leaves you much more room to explore.|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|Let's count my points before I decide what to do. I have 11 HCP and 2 length points. I normally would subtract 1 point for the dubious @HJx but with north opening 1@H I no longer need to do that. So I have 13 starting points. I have 3 queens/jacks and no aces tens and should subtract a point.|
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|According to Bergen hand evaluation you subtract one points when the number of queens and jacks in your hand exceed the aces and tens by 3. You subtract two points when they exceed by 6. You add one or two points if the queens and jacks/aces and tens ratio is the opposite.|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, I have a marginal game force with only 12 starting points. However, just for illustrative purposes, to show how 4th suit forcing works I will bid 2@D. But 3@S would be fine as well. Not sure what I would do in real life.|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|With an aggressive partner I would bid 3@S. With a timid partner I would bid 2@D not that north is timid.|wb|y|ip|60|bm|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1061/1924/files/Slightly_Smiling_Face_Emoji_Icon_42x42.png?16228697460559734940|mb|2D|an|4th suit forcing|
pg| ***** 116 ***** |


mb|P|NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|Responder's (north) priorities are:
 ^C1 - bid 2@S with 3-card support;
 ^C2 - bid 2NT with a diamond stopper (as he will here); 
 ^C3- make another descriptive bid (with 5-4 in hearts and clubs and no diamond stopper he might have to bid 2@H).|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


mb|2N|mb|P|NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|Since he bid 2N denying 3 spades and since showing 3 spades was priority 1 my 3@S bid here shows 6 spades.|mb|3S|
pg| ***** 118 ***** |


mb|P|NT|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2nome: Okay I assume you have a game force so I bid 4@S.|
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|Yes. Clear 4@S bid. With 2 small not as clear but with J9 very clear.|

PC|DA|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|Although leading the unbid suit is often a good idea and leading an opponent's suit is not a good idea. Leading an unprotected ace is usually not a good idea. I strongly discourage you from doing so, unless you have no other good lead. Here west has top of a 3+ card sequence which is often a good lead even in the opponent's suit.|
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|Here I would choose the @CJ rather than the @DA. Without a club sequence I might decide to lead the @DA although I might also lead a trump (although a singleton trump is also often not a good lead.|UP||

NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|I need to discuss my plan first. I am going to lose 3 aces for sure. And for winners, I have 5 spades (if spades break or the @S10 is singleton). On this hand turns out they don't break but I should assume they break for now. And 2 clubs for sure. That's 7. I can set up a diamond for 8 and a heart for 9.|
PG| ***** 125 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|If I had the @SA, I would try for a diamond ruff. But if I lead a diamond they are likely to win the @DA and play 2 rounds of trump. So what I am going to do is hope the @HQ is onside to pitch a diamond loser.|

mb|P|mb|P|MB|2S|NT|^z@3^b@2^^|lb|*yDo you agree with bid by West?^^n|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|In 3rd seat in particular you can be more frisky in opening a weak 2. But with a 5-card suit you should not do so unless you have a singleton or void. Plus at unfavorable vulnerability (you are they are not) you also need to be a bit more cautious.|
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717:   ^*N|cp||at|So although there are many 3rd seat hands where I preempt with a 5-card suit this would not be one of them. Let me give you an undo.|

So unlike if east had passed, 2@C over a takeout double is weak not strong. It is not forcing and usually shows a 6-card suit. But here I want a club lead and because I want a club lead I am stretching a bit.|mb|2C|
