PG| ***** 1 ***** |


mb|2H|mb|4S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@S is fine on this auction. Another possibility would be a 4@H splinter to show a game forcing hand and a singleton heart. But given both opponents are bidding and the @HK is a wasted card, most likely, I think slam is very unlikely.|

pc|S6|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is the lead I choose. With the 1@D opener, North should not lead a diamond and leading unprotected aces is rarely a good idea. You never lead away from aces in a suit contract.|

In fact he probably has the @HA and West has the @HK because if partner had the @HK he might lead away from it given I supported hearts.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And based on the auction I can be sure @HK is the only heart Declarer has.|
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^z@3^b@2^^|lb|*mHow many spades does Declarer have ?^3~4~5^2|at|^B@2^*BMovie Maker^*N: We can answer it. West did not open 1@S and raised partner's negative double. Further, we see seven spades and partner cannot have a singleton spade as leading singleton trumps would not make sense.|
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I also know that West has exactly 1 heart and likely 4 spades: which means he has at least 5 diamonds. So I probably want to lead trump to cut down on ruffs when and if I get in.|pc|S5|pc|SA|pc|S3|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Tactically West has an interesting decision. In IMPs pass could be right. Although a diamond partial is likely. However, he might talk us into a major suit partial. So pass could work out best.|

cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Personally I would open 2@D. A weak 2 in 4th seat shows around 11-14 with a nice 6-card suit. But West has only 10 but a 7-card suit. It is not really a weak 2. It is an opener with a nice 6 card suit.|
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In 3@D, they can take 6 diamonds and 3 aces for 9 tricks.|
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But if we play in hearts, we lose 1 diamond a heart 1 spade and 1 club for sure. Most likely we only make 2@H. It is not clear what is right. My guess is EW would lose less than 2 IMPs, not a big loss.|
