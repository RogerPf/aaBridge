^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It was reasonably well played. At trick 2, the best play is the @DK (or @DQ) taking a ruffing finesse. There are a couple of reasons for this. First, he has limited entries to his hand. |
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So he needs trump to get back. 2nd, he wants to set up diamonds. At worst, he should lose 2 diamonds, 1 spade, and 2 hearts. And if either diamond honor is onside, he can make 3.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In fact, on this hand, depending on how it is defended he might make 4 if he plays a diamond at trick 2 and East covers (as he did). He ruffs high (@CK), leads a club back to his hand, and plays the @D10.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If East covers again, he ruffs again and ends up losing just 2 hearts and 1 spade. But making even 2 is reasonable.  I was just suggesting a slightly better approach.|

Further, I have 3 diamonds. 3 cards in the opponents suit is the worst holding you can have especially if they have not yet found a fit. And I have a flat hand (no singletons or voids). Finally, we are vulnerable and they are not.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good try. Hard hand to make especially when your partner guides the defense. First let me discuss the bidding.|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT|^B@2
1@D by North, as I said, was fine. But I think I would pass 1@H with the North hand. Although you prefer an 8-card fit, a 7-card fit at the 1-level, and usually even at the 2-level is not that bad.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In NT, with no spade stopper, it is very possible they can run off 4 or 5 spade tricks.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Here in 1NT, after they run 4 spades, you get 2 clubs and 1 diamond for sure. Then 1 heart can be set up. |
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT|^B@2
And if hearts are 3-3, or if someone has the doubleton HA and you guess who (but very unlikely), you can get a 2nd heart trick. That only gets you to 5.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I probably play a heart after winning the @DA but a diamond is not a bad idea either.  Either way, consider yourself lucky to make 6 tricks. Not sure if you make 1@H.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On the other hand, if they let you ruff a spade or 2 in dummy it might make. Basically we have a bad fit.|

I hope we can win 4 diamonds rather than 2 although I don't have a sure entry if the diamond finesse wins and diamonds break 4-2.|

Or if the diamond finesse loses, and they break 3-3 I have 4 diamond tricks. So now I am up to 7. I do have a club and a heart that I can set up. But they are awfully slow tricks. All in all, 9 tricks seems a bit tricky but lets give it a try starting with diamonds.|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|This deal come from the annual Lords v Commons match in England from the 2013 match played last November.|
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Every year the House of Commons challenges the House of Lords to a bridge match, a custom that dates back to 1975. The House of Commons and the House of Lords are the two majors arms of the British government, loosely equivalent to the Senate and the House of Representatives in the US. I think. |
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In the early days the match (a teams-of-eight aggregate match) was played with table dealt hands. For the past ten years or so the hands have been selected by me and a commentary written for the players to read afterwards.|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Well, why not? If partner has four Spades and a decent hand he can introduce them into the auction. If he doesn't have four Spades then a response of 1@S will merely hide the Diamond fit.|mb|2d|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|This is a part-score deal with East-West able to make 3@H or 4@C and North-South able to make 3@D. An innocent affair, then? Well, not quite.|
PG| ***** 187 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The hand turned up in a teams-of-four match where one side gained a small but useful swing. Both Norths opened 1@D and one South chose to respond 1@S. West overcalled 2@H (probably better than a take-out Double although the latter would have its adherents) and North raised to 2@S.|
PG| ***** 188 ***** |


NT|^B@2
From this point East-West were due to go plus – if 2@S had been Passed out South would have been forced to toil in a poor contract, which would surely have failed on the @HK lead. As it was, East raised to 3@H and West make ten tricks after the defense slopped an overtrick. |
PG| ***** 189 ***** |


NT|^B@2
At the other table 1@D promised Diamonds. The advantages of this method are not always appreciated by those playing "better minor". Here, South had the opportunity of making the more sensible choice of raising 1@D to 2@D (why introduce a foul suit of @S9 8 x x when you have a sound alternative? |
PG| ***** 190 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If North has Spades he is a grown-up - he can bid them after a raise in Diamonds). West came into the auction with 2@H, of course, and the spotlight turned to shine on North.|
PG| ***** 191 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Sure that his opponents had a fit somewhere North made use of the Law of Total Tricks (which suggests that you should be prepared to bid to the level of the number of trumps). A pre-emptive bash of 4@D put pressure on East who, not knowing whose hand it was, tried 4@H. A Club lead and subsequent Club ruff saw this one off for a swing of 220 points.|
PG| ***** 192 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Note that North switched to the @D2 after taking the @HA. This was a clear signal that he wanted South to lead a Club for a ruff. After the auction the @D2 could hardly be the fourth-highest, could it?|
PG| ***** 193 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In the Lords v Commons match the four scores were:
3@H+1, 4@H making, 4@H-1 and 3@H+2 all played by West.
A swing of 500 to the Commons.|

PG| ***** 196 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|There are all sorts of traps for the unwary when contesting the auction and the tactics of when you should bid, how much you should bid and when you should keep your mouth shut could fill an entire book. In truth, such topics have indeed filled books... Here we can only introduce you to the basic principles.|
PG| ***** 197 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now, vulnerability plays an important part in this area of the game as the risks for bidding are high and penalties are greater when vulnerable. So far in VBlue we have ignored vulnerability – from this issue forward we will include it.|
PG| ***** 198 ***** |


mb|1c?|nt||lb|*bYour bid please.^^1s|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Well, you wouldn't open the bidding with this hand but you certainly should overcall 1@S - the more so when the player on your right has opened 1@C.|
PG| ***** 200 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Why? Well, let's list the reasons... 
1. You have a good suit (overcalls promise five-card suits - and decent ones to boot).
2. Spades is top dog in bridge and you should strain to bid that suit. If partner likes Spades you have a good chance of contesting the auction and of winning the battle to play the hand.|
PG| ***** 201 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
3. You are probably irritating the player on your left who was clearing his throat about to respond 1@D or 1@h. Now he will have a much more difficult response. 
4. If partner is on lead against West's final contract he will find a good lead. You do want a Spade lead, don't you?|mb|1s|
PG| ***** 202 ***** |


NT||mb|p4s|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Partner should know that you aren't promising an opening bid, so he ought to be full value for this raise...|
PG| ***** 203 ***** |


mb|ppp|NT||
PG| ***** 204 ***** |


pc|c8|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Spades: Four tricks, maybe five. You'll have to take the Spade finesse and see how your luck is today. If East has the @SK (and the suit breaks nicely) then you'll have five tricks;|
PG| ***** 205 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Hearts: An easy suit to analyse. Three winners no losers;|
PG| ***** 206 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Diamonds: Certainly no winners here. There are four losers in hand but the doubleton in dummy means that you only have two losers. Mind you, dummy may run out of trumps. Awkward, this one;|
PG| ***** 207 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Clubs: One winner, no loser. The @CK is a strong favourite to lie over the @CA Q (East opened 1@C) so the finesse at trick one looks to be a pointless play.|
