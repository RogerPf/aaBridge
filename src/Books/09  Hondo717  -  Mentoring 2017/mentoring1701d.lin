^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With 4 aces and 5 quick tricks, this hand is worth much more than 19 HCP. I could open 1@D and rebid 2N. Or I could choose to open 2N. Let's watch what happens when I open 1@D.|mb|1D|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I sort of cheated on this hand by playing it double dummy (e.g. as if I could see all 52 cards which I could). I just did it to show how an endplay might work. But I am not sure I would really find it in real life.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If I opened 2N I suspect we just get to 4@H with no interference. In 4@S they lose 1 Spade, 1 Heart, 2 Diamonds, and 1 Club for down 2. So double would have been better than my 5@H bid :).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out 3N can be defeated if West ducks the 2nd diamond. But again that is hard to see. However, there is really no reason to take the 2nd diamond trick either. With the club entry, the diamond trick is probably not disappearing.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As to whether we should be in 3N, it is hard to say for sure, but I think, once I choose to bid 1N rather than 2N over 1@H North should pass 2N. 3N is not a good contract, and only made because of the lucky spade lead.|

PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On the other hand, there is one good feature about my having 5 spades. I know partner likely is short and if partner is short in spades it makes it more likely they have something in clubs. But I will reluctantly pass.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |

I effectively have only 5 working HCP-- the @CKQ. My @dQ is suspect, and my @SJ is worthless and the hand could still be a misfit.|mb|p|

jordymil:  Are we playing UDCA signals?|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No we will play standard signals at my table since that is what my students play for the most part. I don't think anything is wrong with UDCA.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You give attitude signal here which is the @C5 with standard signals. The theory with UDCA "upside down count and attitude" is a low card encourages and a high card discourages.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The idea being you don't want to waste a high card when you want to encourage because it might be useful. And there are some situations where the low card encourages works out well.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But there are also situations, like here, where the high card discourages might not work out well. If playing UDCA, the @C10 would be the correct signal (high discourages). However, if I didn't have the @C9 that could cost our side a trick.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So although I would say a large number of good players (not sure that it is a majority or not) play upside down I am not convinced it is the right way to play.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT|^B@2
And I (and they) often find it is confusing when giving count. In fact some play upside down attitude but standard count which can get really confusing. My recommendation is you stick with standard signals. I think there is no real advantage to UDCA although many would disagree with me.|pc|C5|

jordymil:  I thought present count?|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In general that is correct. But here if you play the @H2, because you led 4th best to start with, that is the correct signal. Usually present count applies when leading back a suit. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well bid and well played. Note that East correctly bid only 2N not 3N. 3N would have been a slight overbid. Also, West did well to set up diamonds to take 9 tricks.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


NT|^B@2
brains88:  How does one know if East has a 15-17 NT opener or is stronger? He had 18.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First of all, it is more likely he has 18 because with 15-17 he would often open 1N. And he wouldn't bid 2N with less than 17 or a good 16.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Although you theoretically could have 11 HCP you normally have 6-9 or 10. So with less than 17, 2N is a bit of an over bid. Partner would bid 2 of a minor rather than 2N. And if responder has 10 or 11, they could then bid 2N invitational.|
pg| ***** 78 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is why the 2N rebid by East should be considered 17-18 asking West to bid 3N with a good 8 or more.|

I would take the Diamond finesse right away at trick 3. If it wins, then I might still be able to either ruff 2 diamonds or the @DK might be tripleton.|

If hearts are not 2-2 it might not be possible to ruff 2 diamonds if you draw trump first. But that is a very minor point. The hand is alwasy making 4 and 5 if hearts are 2-2 and the diamond finesse wins.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding was fine, although the contract was terrible. That happens on occasion when there is a bad fit especially an 8-card fit. That is why you should tend to be more conservative with an 8 card fit and more aggressive with a 9-card fit.|
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As I said there is no clear line. You have 4 top losers--3 spades and a heart. So best is down 1. First I would unblock the @DA and @DJ and then I would play a trump intending to lead a heart towards dummy's @HKQ when I got to my hand. At best that might save 1 trick. Still likely down 1.|
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On this hand East does not know how many spades West has. So there is no way to judge how conservative to be based on trump length. As I said East should be a little concerned with having 4 bad spades. But if West has a 5 card suit that is not such a big deal.|
PG| ***** 146 ***** |


NT|^B@2
East has a very nice hand although the aces in the minors would be much better if they were in the majors. So East's hand does have major flaws despite its quality suit and great 6-4 shape.|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |

PG| ***** 173 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Regardless, I will confess to an error in today's deal. Look at the South hand. You open one spade and partner raises to two spades. What would you do now?|
PG| ***** 174 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I was in Phoenix for the Fall North American Championships, playing for a few hours with friends. North was Eddie Kantar, a two-time world champion and an excellent teacher and author. We were playing against Eddie's wife, Yvonne, and Vinita Gupta, who was fresh from winning the Baze Senior Knockout Teams, her first national title. |
PG| ***** 175 ***** |


NT|^B@2
When Kantar raised to two spades, I thought I would keep my heart suit hidden, so jumped to four spades. Error! |
PG| ***** 176 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Gupta led the diamond six. I put in dummy's 10 and ruffed East's queen. Then I led my low club, but West, who could see three major-suit winners, went in with her ace and shifted to a low spade. I had to lose two spades, one heart and one club. |
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If I had sensibly rebid three hearts, North would have raised to four hearts. Then, it is true, I might have bid again, because North could have held, for example, king-third of spades and king-fifth of hearts, when six hearts would have been excellent. |
PG| ***** 178 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But we would have stopped in five hearts. Then, after I drove out the club ace, cashed the heart ace, and discarded two spades on the king-queen of clubs, a spade-diamond crossruff would have produced 11 tricks. |

bt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|3@C - a new suit at the three-level - is forcing to game. When made by the opening bidder in sequences such as this, it is called a high-level reverse. Neither partner may Pass now until game is reached.|
pg| ***** 186 ***** |


AT| 
 
Now, the word "reverse" in bidding theory causes all sorts of angst among the uninitiated. Let's make it simple. When the opener bids two suits he is asking responder for preference. If preference can be given back to opener's first suit at the two-level then the bid is not a reverse (generally speaking opener has bid his suits downwards). If responder has to give preference at the three-level then opener has "reversed" - generally he has bid his suits upwards. Thus in the following auction 2@H:|
ht|I|CS|6|at|^B{|ia|o1s2C2H|at|}|HT|I|AT|^K@2is not a reverse (responder can give preference to 2@S) but...|
pg| ***** 187 ***** |


HT|N|CS|6|at|^B{|ia|o1H2C2S|at|}|HT|N|AT|^K@22@S is a reverse as responder has to bid 3@H to give preference. Simple!] This may be counter-intuitive, so it's worth exploring. |

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|3@S is forcing (neither partner can Pass until game is reached) so North is unlimited. If North didn't like Spades much, he could make other bids so he has genuine enthusiasm for the suit.|
PG| ***** 190 ***** |


NT|^B@2
What you have to understand is that 4@S would have been a weaker bid than 3@S. In fact, 4@S would have been a sign-off ("I have Spade support but no interest in anything higher.") 3@S by contrast shows interest in higher things. In essence it's giving you more room to explore.|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Well, partner has shown a nice hand. - so it's no surprise that he has got one. Again - for emphasis - after a game-forcing reverse, simple preference (here it was 3@S) is highly encouraging.|
PG| ***** 196 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Time, in fact, to Count and Plan.
Spades: Probably five tricks and no losers (it depends on the split); |
PG| ***** 197 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Hearts: One obvious loser and one (slow) winner; 
Diamonds: Five easy tricks; 
Clubs: One winner and three losers. Maybe you can ruff some? |
PG| ***** 198 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Count those winners again. Five Spades (unless there's a bad split), one Heart (after the @HA has gone), five Diamonds and the @CA. That's twelve. |
PG| ***** 199 ***** |

NT|^B@2
Remember - losers can either be trumped or dumped. Here, you can dump the losing Clubs on the @HK and on the two long Diamonds. Soon it's time to draw trumps and you might think which one to play first.|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding.
Here, as South, we hold a powerful 5-4-3-1 hand. We open 1@S and partner bids 2@D – not where we have a singleton (which would suppress our enthusiasm) but where we have a very interesting holding of @DA Q ×.|
PG| ***** 216 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We rebid 3@C, which is forcing to game as it is a new suit at the three-level. From this point, our partnership cannot Pass any non-game bid – the only exception would be if the opponents wander in to the auction and we could Double them for gazillions. Not very likely and irrelevant here.|
PG| ***** 217 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Anyway, over 3@C partner bids 3@S, returning to our first-bid suit. This is a point of bidding theory that needs emphasis. When we are in a game-forcing auction (note these terms and conditions!) then the cheapest bid is often the strongest bid. |
PG| ***** 218 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If partner bid game at this point (say he bid 3NT or 4@S) he'd be making a terminal bid, showing little or no interest in higher matters. By bidding 3@S he is giving us a chance to describe more features of our hand should we so wish – in some cases no nook nor cranny goes unexplored.|
PG| ***** 219 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Here, the crucial point about our hand is the Diamond fit. We have every reason to suspect that we have a running side-suit in this hand and hence a source of tricks. With that in mind, we are quite justified in having a bash at a slam – via "the old Black". |
PG| ***** 220 ***** |


NT|^B@2
4NT elicits the information that there are not two Aces missing (although one is lurking in an opponent's hand) so we take the plunge and bid 6@S.|
pg| ***** 221 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Play.
In playing the hand after West leads the @HJ, we can count five Spades (on normal breaks) one Heart (after the @HA has gone), five Diamonds and the @CA. That makes twelve tricks, so the order of the day is to draw trumps as quickly as possible. |
PG| ***** 222 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Although we may appear to have losing Clubs, there is no need to ruff them on table – here the losers will be dumped on dummy's red winners.|
PG| ***** 223 ***** |


NT|^B@2
East takes the @HA over the @HQ and returns a Club. We don't finesse (the all-essential Count has told us that this is unnecessary) and we turn straight to the trumps. |
PG| ***** 224 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With this combination, the most efficient method is to cash the @SK, then the @SA and discover the 4-1 break onside. Now it's easy to take the marked Spade finesse, draw trumps and run the red-suit winners.|
PG| ***** 225 ***** |


NT|^B@2
All the losing Clubs get parked on the long Diamonds and the @HQ. 6@S bid and made. |
