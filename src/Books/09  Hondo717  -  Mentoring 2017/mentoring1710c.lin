PG| ***** 4 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that, suppose I had an invitational hand. What should I bid with an invitational hand?  3@S here is normally just competing. It says I prefer playing 3@S to letting them play 3@H. It is NOT invitational normally.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So some advanced players play something called a "^*bmaximal^*n" double. It is unlikely I would want to double 3H for penalty. So if you play maximal doubles, a double here by me would be an invite to 4@S whereas a 3@S bid would just be competitive, saying I want to play 3@S.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Maximal Doubles only apply when there is no room to bid. For example, had the opponents been competing in clubs instead of hearts then I have 3@D and 3@H to make an invite but here I have no bid. Anyway, here I have a clear 4@S call.|

NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another way to make an extra trick, which would be important in match points is to play a spade before drawing trump. Then east could ruff 2 spades in dummy and score 2 ruffs instead of 1 for 11 tricks.|

PG| ***** 75 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You could play gambling 3N. Gambling 3N is similar to a minor suit preempt with the addition of allowing you to play in 3N. It shows a solid minor (AKQ) with 7 or 8 cards and no outside aces or kings.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Responder passes having stoppers in all of the other 3 suits (it will be obvious which minor partner has if responder has a minor suit stopper). Otherwise he/she normally bid 4@C and partner passes with clubs or corrects to diamonds. In this case I know we can make 5 of a minor since I have plenty of tricks outside the minor and no matter which minor partner has we are only losing 2 tricks in the other minor.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


mb|3N|mb|P|NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I will bid 5@C which will either be passed out or corrected to 5@D. I can't leave it in 3N because they will take lots of tricks in one of the minors. BTW, Over gambling 3N, 4@C is just pass or correct and not Gerber. It doesn't come up much, but I like gambling 3N. It is a very descriptive bid.|mb|5C|

up|8|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Everyone probably gets to 5@D but gambling 3N made it easy.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT||at|^^^B@2^*BMovie Maker:^*n  In our studio when doing the movie, we pondered the following. The strong mainstream 3N is reasonably uncommon. The Gambling 3N is also reasonably uncommon. And the 4@C after the the strong 3N is Gerber and is not after the gambling. Then how can the hapless responder tell which one is which. So we sent an email to Hoard for help. Next is is full response.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| If you play Gambling 3NT, then whenever you open 3NT you have a hand with a 7 or 8 card minor headed by the AKQ and no aces or kings in any of the other 3 suits. That is the only hand you can have. You can't have a strong hand (25-27). With that hand you would open 2@C and rebid 3NT.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Therefore, responder passes with a stopper in 3 suits. (If he has a hand with stoppers in 3 suits, he knows for sure that opener's minor is the 4th suit since he can't have the A, K, or Q in that suit.) If responder does not have stoppers in 3 suits, then he usually bids 4@C. Opener passes with clubs or corrects to 4@D.|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| This particular hand was unusual in that I (south) had 5 tricks in spades and hearts and a doubleton in both minors. So I knew we could make 5 of a minor and not 3NT. So I bid 5@C which partner is supposed to pass or correct to 5@D. Think of Gambling 3NT as a minor suit preempt with the additional bonus that sometimes you get to play and make 3NT.|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


nt||at|^^^B@2^*BMovie Maker:^*n That is great. Also, you can get more from |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/gamblng_3_no_trump.html,Gambling 3NT^*N|CP||FP||at| link.

pc|HT|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Correct lead by west. If they played "coded" 10s and 9s, then it would be a slightly different lead. let me explain the theory of coded 10s first against NT only (which doesn't apply here). If you play standard leads, you would lead the J from J10, AJ10 and KJ10. So if you lead the J, partner is not sure whether or not you have something higher.|
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you play coded 10s (sometimes also called "jack denies") you lead the jack with no higher honor (e.g. J10) and you lead the 10 from AJ10 and KJ10. That was the original idea. Then someone decided they might as well apply a similar theory to 9s. That is, if you lead the 9, you have either nothing higher than the 9 (rare) or A109 K109 or Q109.|
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if playing coded 9s west would have led the 9 from her holding. But playing standard leads the 10 is correct.|

The most obvious is to set up diamonds and I will finesse into east since she has no more hearts. Even if it loses that is the only trick I will lose.

nt|^^^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*n Soon after nome learned about gambling 3N from a recent Howard's mentoring session he faced one at a bridge table and decided to throw a monkey wrench in the opponent's bidding. See how brilliant he was. Howard later made his comments on the bidding and the play.  It is a refresher on gambling 3N.|

NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me go over gambling 3N. A Gambling 3NT shows a running 7-card or 8-card minor with no outside aces or kings. "Running" means the suit should be headed by the AKQ. So North's 3NT is technically incorrect and I would not have made a Gambling 3NT bid. |
PG| ***** 111 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that, since the suit was 8 cards long, and the probability of partner having a void is very low, there is a reasonable probability that the suit will run anyway. If partner has a singleton club, then it is 50% that the suit will run (2-2 break or singleton queen). And if partner has a doubleton club, all that is needed is a 2-1 break (80%).|

NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's now discuss what responder should do over a Gambling 3NT, assuming the next opponent passes. If responder has stoppers in the 3 other suits he passes. Otherwise, he bids 4@C and partner passes or corrects to 4@D.|

Often, based on their minor suit holdings it will be obvious which minor suit opener has. But regardless, they should make the same bid as they would have if the opening bid had been a 4 of a minor preempt. |

NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So East made the very nice and 100% correct bid of 4@S. That is the same bid he would have made if North had opened 4@C.|

sk||NT||mb|5D|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The only way to explain South's incorrect bid of 5@D is that he must have forgot they were playing Gambling 3NT. If he remembered, then he knows for sure they have a 10 or 11 card club fit. With South's diamonds it is obvious North's suit is clubs. So his correct bid is 5@C. And that makes.|

pc|HK|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although it is possible that West has a singleton spade and East can give him a ruff, East correctly defended by cashing hearts. Note he started with the @HK. Although the modern opening lead from AK is the A, in the middle of the hand you lead the K from AK on defense. Why? Because when the @HK wins partner will know you have the @HA as well.|
