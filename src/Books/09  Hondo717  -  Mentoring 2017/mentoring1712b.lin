mb|3S|mb|4H|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|lb|*yIs 4H by North advisable?^^n|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For 2 reasons North really should not bid 4@H. 
1. North already got the message across with 2@H and the hand has not changed
2. 4@H may force a 4@S bid by the opponents and I am not sure North wants that to happen.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


mb|P|mb|P|mb|4S|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That's a good bid. 4@S over 4@H with a 9+ card fit is almost always right.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We could have defended a bit better. North needs to count the defensive tricks. North can see 2 tricks for sure.|hc|sada|at| and once West plays the @CA, North should be worried about a heart discard on the @CK.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


lc|dasa|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So although 2nd hand low is right 99% of the time there are occasionally cases where 2nd hand high is correct.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The most common (although not on this hand) is when you can take the setting trick. Another time (which does apply here) is when you have a timing issue - you are afraid declarer my discard a loser.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And that is the case here. North should be very worried that West will be discarding a losing heart on the @CK. So North should pop up with the @SA and lead a heart before that happens and hope that partner has the @DK giving us 4 tricks (2 diamonds, 1 spade, 1 heart).|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Defense is hard. But one of the things good defenders have to do is visualize how they can beat the contract. As declarer your planning is essentially visualizing how you are going to make the contract. That is much easier, because you control all of your sides assets.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Visualizing on defense is much harder because each defender can see only half the assets their side has. Therefore, they have to figure out what partner needs in order to beat the contract.|

pc|H9|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us discuss the lead from 4 small. I prefer 4th best but there are other reasonable alternatives as well. Top of nothing is one scheme. The problem is partner does not know how many cards I have in the suit but many players would choose the 9 anyway from West's hand.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2Barbie1970: I thought if I lead a small I was saying I had an honor which I don't.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not necessarily in NT. As I said, I prefer count to attitude particularly in NT. But if you want to play you lead a high card from 3 small or 4 small, that is reasonable, just not what I prefer. Some players would lead the @S10 from West's hand.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Leading the heart is fine. It is just a matter of which heart, I think in general, leading your longest suit in NT (assuming the opponents did not bid it) works out best the most often. Count is often more important than showing your highest card.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 9 also could cost you a trick depending on what spot cards I have. If for example I held @HAK8x in my hand. That would give East the @HJ10 doubleton. The lead of 9 would allow me to take 4 heart tricks in stead of 3. So the 9 is a risky lead.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |

nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2nome: As to points, I think my partner has about 5-6 HCP.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good thinking because, particularly on hands where declarer bids NT you can often count out partner's points. In this hand dummy has 12 points East has 8 points, and I show 15-17. That is a total of 35-37. So West has 3-5 points.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good defenders do this calculation on every hand. Sometimes you don't know declarer's points so precisely and it is not possible to do such a precise calculation. But often you do.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|at|^B@2^*BMovie Maker:  ^*nAs a reminder please note the players, except Howard can only see the dummy. And we are trying to simulate the live plays. That is why we have so many closing and opening of the hands.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


sk|s|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to planning, I can count 3 heart tricks, 2 spade tricks, and 2 club tricks for seven sure tricks. I need 2 more. One possibility is 3-3 clubs. That would give me 8. Another possibility is to play some diamonds. If diamonds are 3-3 and the @DA is onside that gives me 9 tricks.|

pc|C2|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Correct lead by North. You only lead top of a sequence in NT when you have a 3-card sequence. With a 2 card sequence you lead low. In a suit contract, the @CK is correct because you want to establish fast tricks before they are ruffed. But in a NT contract, you want to establish long suit tricks.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us discuss how West might want to plan. West can count 9 sure tricks--6 diamonds, 1 club and 2 spades. In IMPs West might just take those tricks. But in Match Points West may want to establish another trick. |
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The @C2  lead means that North probably only has 4 clubs. However, that really doesn't matter because if West tries to establish a 10th trick by playing a heart knowing that at most they are likely to lose 3 club tricks. |
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|They still only make 3NT by losing 1 heart and 3 clubs. So after wining with @CA should play diamonds. That guarantees 9 tricks even against a 4-0 split. Let us proceed.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This was an easy hand to play if you counted winners. Okay, let me discuss a different and probably better auction. Rather than bidding 1NT, an underbid, or 2NT, a slight overbid, West might bid 2@C, showing a limit raise in diamonds. |
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That should make East very interested in 3NT. East's only concern is if their side has a club stopper. So over 2@C (limit raise or better), East should bid 3@C. That asks West to bid 3NT with a club stopper.  And here West would do.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2nome: I will follow but I learned most likely from you that responder should use Texas transfer when in his/her supreme judgement slam is not a probability. And use regular transfer when the probability of slam is good.|

mb|4D|an|Teacher's choice|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The most common usage of Texas is to play in 4 of a major. But it can also be used, as on this hand, to establish trump and then bid RKCB or Kickback to look for slam. Most experts agree with this. |
PG| ***** 99 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Auctions which begin with a 2-level transfer and then responder jumps to 4NT are ambiguous at best (e.g. 1N-2@H-2@S-4N). Many experts play that as quantitative, giving opener a choice of pass, 5@S, 6@S, and 6N. There is no ambiguity if responder starts with Texas and then bids 4NT. That is RKCB. |
PG| ***** 100 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, the auction 1N-2@H-2@S-4@S is defined as a mild slam try by responder. If responder just wanted to be in game he would simply bid Texas. Opener, with a lot of aces and kings and good trump support, might occasionally go on after the 4@S bid. Of course, the same thing applies when responder has hearts.|

PG| ***** 106 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|^f4N = 1 or 4 key cards
^f5@C = 0 or 3 key cards
^f5@D = 2 key cards without the trump queen. Here @HQ.
^f5@H = 2 key cards with the trump queen.|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason to play kickback is if you have 0 or 3 and if you were playing 4NT as RKCB then responder would bid 5@D with 0 or 3. And the RKCB bidder would not be able to ask for the trump Queen without committing to slam. But if you play kickback then with 0 or 3 responder bids 5@C, so 5@D is still available as the queen ask without committing to slam.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Just looking at the North/South cards, I would like to be in 5@D. But it is difficult to bid. You do have 3 potential losers - 1 club, 1 spade, and 1 diamond. But if the @DQ is singleton or doubleton (50%), that eliminates the diamond loser. |
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If the @SK is onside (50%), that eliminates the spade loser. And, based on the auction, since West showed the majority of the defenders' strength, the odds of the @SK being onside are actually somewhat greater than 50%. So 5@D will make more than 75% of the time.|
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would not want to be in 6@D even though it happens to make on this layout. The odds of making 6@D are a little better than 25% (both 50% chances working).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would pass also. Some might double but I really dislike having only 3 cards in the 1 unbid major when making a takeout double. And will only do so with a strongish takeout double or 3 spades to 2 honors.|
