lb|*mWould you bid 2H with East hand?^Yes~No~I may consider it^2|


cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would open 2@H with the East hand but there are good arguments not to do so.|
pg| ***** 2 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Heart suit is weak, the two aces give me lots of defense, and in 2nd seat, your preempts should be more robust than in other seats. The reason being it is more likely you are preempting your partner.|mb|P|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


mb|P|mb|1S|NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1@S is fine. but in 4th seat, West might also open 2@S. An opening 2 bid in 4th seat is not a weak 2. There is no reason to preempt in 4th seat. An opening 2-bid shows a nice 6 card suit with a min opener (11-13 or so).|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


mb|P|mb|2H|mb|P|mb|2S|mb|P|mb|P?|NT|^z@3^b@2^^|lb|*bBid for South.^^p|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Usually, I don't like to let the opponents play at the 2-level when the points are evenly spread. |
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But this is not the same auction as, for example, it went 1@S-P-2@S-P-P-?. There, you know the opponents have an 8+-card fit. And "if they have a fit you have a fit." Here, there is no reason to think they necessarily have a fit so balancing is more risky. |
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And, in terms of competing, the worst holding you can have in opponent's suit is 3 small. Plus I have a pretty weak club suit and a flat hand. The only plus for competing is we are not vul. However, the minuses far outweigh the pluses and I will pass. |
PG| ***** 8 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Having said that, as the kibs and I can see, we do have a club fit. As you know I can see the four hands but at these teaching tables I play the boards as I do at a normal table.|mb|P|
pg| ***** 9 ***** |


pc|D2|NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is the opening lead I would choose as well although leading away from a queen often gives away a trick (as it does on this hand). But no other lead seems better. |
PG| ***** 10 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And here, if West plays correctly it does give away a trick. If West is forced to play diamonds herself, she has 2 losers. But once North lead a diamond, West only has 1 diamond loser.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|lb|*CPlay from East hand by clicking that card on the right.^^d6^dat6|pc|D6|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West needs to play low. Otherwise West is conceding 2 diamond tricks. Whereas by playing low, if North holds either the @DK or @DQ, West only has 1 diamond loser. And if I had both the KQ, playing low doesn't cost anything.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East/West should definitely not be in 4@S. The spade break was very lucky. More often than not they will lose a spade. And the diamond lead (although it is the same lead I would have chosen) gave them an extra trick as well. So 2@S is plenty. Good auction and correct result.|

PG| ***** 29 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is tempting but there are 2 arguments against.
^c a) you are 5-4 in the majors
^c b) you don't have classic NT distribution.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But the argument for is you have no way of showing your points when,  whatever pard responds (1N in particular). So if you chose to open 1N it could work out.|

at|^^
I wouldn't bid your hand 1N but some would and that would be reasonable.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |

pg| ***** 33 ***** |


mb|P|mb|3C|NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's play |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=bergenraises,Reverse Bergen^*N|CP||FP||at| and have West bid 3@C (10-12 with 4-card raise). If West then decided to bid 4@S over a 3@S bid by East that would be fine and is one of the advantages of Bergen. You can show a limit raise and still bid game when need be.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I used to prefer Reverse Bergen. The idea being you are more likely to want to explore for game with a limit raise and this gives you more room. But these days I prefer regular Bergen meaning 3@D would be the limit raise. But I think most play reverse bergen, so that is what I chose.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


mb|P|mb|4S|NT|^^^B@2nome: My had is 18 and + 12 = 30. So I go for game and not try for slam.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You do have a bit more than 18 but I agree with your 4@s bid. You have 17 HCP, 1 length point, -1 for dubious KQ, 1 for 2 doubletons and 1 for 4-card heart suit. That is 19. But still 19 + 12 is 31 which is well shy of slam.

Further, the East hand is flawed. Any time more than half your HCP are in your short suits that is a downgrade.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|
pg| ***** 38 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|lb|*CLead for South by clicking that card on the right.^^C8^S73HA4C8642DAT742|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally, given no obvious lead, as here, I lead my longest suit with no honors. That will tend to be the most passive lead I can make. However, here I do have some slightly extra information, although it is not critical.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@C was artificial and my partner did not double.  Then, my partner can't have great clubs. So, if I had a choice between leading a diamond or a club I would choose a diamond. But here I don't want to lead a diamond away from my ace.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


at|^^^^^B@2nome: But declarer would be mighty pleased if you lead a CLUB.|wb|P|ip|60|bm|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1061/1924/files/Slightly_Smiling_Face_Emoji_Icon_42x42.png?16228697460559734940|
pg| ***** 42 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I will lead a club anyway. A spade is another possible lead. Some would choose the @HA. I don't particularly like that lead, although it will work out if pard has the @HK or the @SA. But it will often give away a trick, as it does here.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also, I led top of nothing. However, actually I prefer to lead count when playing with my expert partners. But most less experienced players prefer top of nothing which is fine. Just don't play "MUD" (middle up down).|

up|40|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East should have planned the line of play slightly differently.
a) should have played the @CA at trick 1 to unblock the suit if need be (can now overtake the @CQ with the @CK if need be).|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|b) should have ended up in dummy after 2 rounds of trump so he could lead a heart towards the @HK in case North has the @HA. On this hand it doesn't matter since hearts are 2-2 and the @HA is off side. But there are many hands where it would matter.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you can see, despite East's 19 points it is quite possible that 4@S could go down. Declarer could lose 1 diamond, 1 spade, and up to 3 hearts depending on how everything is distributed.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That shows you that East's hand was not nearly as good as it looked at first blush. That is due to the concentration of HCP in the short suits and the lack of a singleton or void.|

PG| ***** 128 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason I count 3 spade tricks is that if I finesse against South twice (and spades are 3-2), I will lose only 1 spade. So I will take 3 spade tricks in dummy plus 1 ruff in my hand. So I am up to 9 tricks. If North has one heart honor, that gives me a 10th trick.|

AT|Yes, that is a 9-card club suit (I suspect it won't fit on everyone's computer monitor).

I held this hand as the dealer at favorable vulnerability. In general, I preempt on the 2-level with a 6-card suit, the 3-level with 7, the 4-level with 8, and the 5-level with 9. So, I opened 5@C.|
