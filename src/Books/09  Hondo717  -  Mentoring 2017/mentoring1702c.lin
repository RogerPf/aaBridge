Now here I have an interesting issue. I do have a 6-card suit and could simply bid 3@D preemptive. But that takes the heart suit out of play,and I have nice hearts.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So I will bid 2@D DONT (diamonds and a major) and hope they don't outbid us in spades. The other problem with bidding 2@D is that we could have game if partner has as little as the @HQ and @DK. This is a prime example of distributional hands being undervalued if you primarily use HCP as your hand evaluation technique. This hand has 13 HCP but it worth somewhere in the vicinity of 20 points at least.|mb|2D|an|diamonds and a major|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The defense was too helpful to declarer on this hand. At trick three they should never have lead diamonds, so setting up diamond suit. |
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT|^B@2
And even when they do, the hand can still be defeated. East should be able to visualize how after overruffing the @DJ lead if East leads the @SA, declarer is guaranteed to be down 1. |

NT|^B@2
Let us go back to trick 5, West played @DJ (which was in error), as to how.|up|23|

NT|^B@2
At trick 5, West should have not played the diamond setting up the suit.|pc|H5|pc|H7|pc|D3|

NT|^B@2
Even then, at trick six after overruffing the @DJ lead, West should play @SA instead of @C4|pc|sA|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If declarer ruffs the @SA, as he should,|PC|H6|

then he is left with @HAKJ9 and @D1094 of diamonds and East is guaranteed a trick.|

NT|^B@2
Now if declarer cashes the @HAK, the East's @HQ is good and if declarer leads another diamond, then East is guaranteed a trick by ruffing. This is not that hard to visualize. So most Easts, not just experts, should be able to find that defense.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's discuss the 1NT bid. I play that denies 3 spades except when responder has a 3-card limit raise and that is what I recommend everyone play. A few people play what is known as "constructive" raises where 2@S shows a good 7 to a bad 10.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So they have to bid 1NT with 3-card support and a weak hand. But I don't recommend nor like constructive raises. I think, in fact, it is more important to bid 2@S with a weak hand because it is somewhat preemptive and forces competition at the 3-level.|

NT|^B@2
a) Pass, the problem being that means it will be difficult to get back in the auction later.|

NT|^B@2
b) Make a takeout double with only 2 clubs, when a takeout double promises at least 3 cards in all of the unbid suits.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I personally would double. I often will make an imperfect takeout double with Ax or Kx in one of the minors. Partner will strain to bid a major so quite often I will end up in hearts.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT|^B@2
And if partner bids my 2-card minor I hope they have a 5-card suit and tell them I owe them a club from the previous hand.|
pg| ***** 47 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other choice, which I do with some partners is to play a 1NT overcall as 14-17 when not vul which means I would be able to bid 1NT with the West hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand it doesn't matter how I play the spades because they are placed unfavorably. But the best way to play the spades, with 9-card fit missing King and Jack is to cash the @SA then cross over to dummy and lead a low spade towards the @SQ10. |
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This way I may lose no spades or only one spade, without having to guess, or two spades when West, in this hand, has three or four spades headed with King and Jack. Unfortunately, with this particular hand, to cross over to dummy I have to trump @HK which is winner. But I have nothing to discard from dummy.|

nt|^B@2^z@3^^The purpose of this exercise is to try to find a way to maximize your chances of losing only 1 ^*Btrick^*N in the spade suit.
|
pg| ***** 54 ***** |


wt|s|nt|^B@2^z@3^^It turns out that there is a way to play this suit to avoid losing 2 ^*Btricks^*N whenever it is possible to do so. The key is not to take any kind of ^*Bfinesse^*N on the first round of spades - make sure to win the first round of the ^*Btrick^*N with the @SA. |pc|Sa|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


md|0,s7,,skj6|nt|^B@2^z@3^^Assume that both ^*Bdefenders^*N ^*Bfollow^*N with small cards to the first ^*Btrick^*N (if an ^*Bhonor^*N card is played by either ^*Bdefender^*N there would be no way for the ^*Bdeclarer^*N to lose more than 1 spade ^*Btrick^*N).

|
pg| ***** 56 ***** |


pc|s7s2s6|
pg| ***** 57 ***** |


wt|n|nt|^B@2^z@3^^The ^*Bdeclarer^*N should continue by crossing back to ^*Bdummy^*n in another suit in order to lead a second round of spades toward the ^*Bhand^*N. |
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


pc|s4|nt|^B@2^z@3^^On the layout shown above, East is welcome to take his @sK, but that will be the only ^*Btrick^*N that the ^*Bdefense^*N wins in this suit. |
pg| ***** 59 ***** |

nt|^B@2^z@3^^As before, the @sK will be the only spade ^*Bwinner^*N for the ^*Bdefense^*N. |

up|7|nt|^B@2^z@3^^The recommended play will also work if East was dealt all 4 spades. |md|0,0,,skj7|
pg| ***** 63 ***** |


nt|^B@2^z@3^^In fact, the only time that this play will lose is if West was dealt 3 or 4 spades headed by both the @SK and the @SJ. On this layout (as we have in Board 2) there is nothing that the ^*Bdeclarer^*N could have done to avoid the loss of 2 spades ^*Btricks^*N. |md|0,skj6|
pg| ***** 64 ***** |


nt|^B@2^z@3^^Cashing the @sA on the first round of the suit allows the ^*Bdeclarer^*N to hold his spade ^*Blosers^*N to 1 on any layout of the East-West cards in which this is possible. |
pg| ***** 65 ***** |


nt|^B@2^y@3^^^^|cs||at|^-{If you have a 9-card ^*Bfit^*N missing only the King and Jack and if you can afford to lose a ^*Btrick^*N

nt|^B@2^z@3^^Here is an example of a layout in which the recommended playing the @SA gains over taking a first round ^*Bfinesse^*N. West has the @SK and the ^*Bdeclarer^*N can actually play this suit for 6 ^*Btricks^*N (not that he needs 6 ^*Btricks^*N) by correctly playing the @SA on the first ^*Btrick^*N. |

mb|x|
pg| ***** 99 ***** |


NT|^B@2 North should technically pass with only 5 dummy points (4 HCP and a doubleton). But personally with the North hand I would bid 2@S over the double (and pass, as he did, over a pass by West).|mb|2s|
PG| ***** 100 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason being 2@S forces EW to the 3 level. I want to compete since the Law of Total Tricks says it is safe to bid 2@S and if that pushes partner too high, I am willing to risk that.|
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But if West passes, I don't want to encourage partner. So I pass. In general, you should be more aggressive in competitive auctions when you have a fit and less aggressive if non-competitive.|
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Most players do the opposite. Less aggressive in competition feeling that the opponents have points. But you should be more aggressive.|MB|PPP|
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Kib: What would East need to balance after the 3 passes?|
pg| ***** 104 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I wouldn't hate a balancing double even with East's 7 HCP hand because of the perfect 1-4-4-4 distribution. The problem is some partners "can't take a joke" and would bid too much.|
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


NT|^B@2
And if West has a nice hand with good spades there is no guarantee EW has a fit and West might bid something like 2NT which is probably too high.|
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So in IMPs in particular, I think pass is fine. I would want East to have at least 9 or 10 points to bid usually.|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But in MPs, where letting them play 1@S could end up being a very bad board, I would double even with 7 HCP.|

NT|^B@2
If you think they are going to make game, don't compete. If you don't think they are going to make game then you can bid. So I would pass with the North hand. But if East bids 4@S I would compete to 5@H assuming I am playing against competent opponents.|UB||

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|OK West, your 3@H showed a minimum of 10 points which you have and partner knows that. Partner chose to only bid 3@S knowing you have at least 10. |
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So, given you have what you promised the first time then why would you bid 4@S? You already told your story. He said "fine, let's stop in 3@S." Why would you override his decision?|
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Remember, once you tell your story, unless partner asks you another question, don't tell it twice. So I think pass is pretty clear since you don't have anything more than what you told partner about.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West made a small error at trick one and I pounced on it by overtaking the @DQ with my @DK and leading back a heart, I was "screaming" to partner that I had a singleton heart and thankfully my partner has very good ears.|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West should foresee this possibility given the 2@H overcall, South has at most 2 hearts since EW have 6 and North has at least 5 hearts. And if North has 6 hearts (very possible) South has a singleton heart. So West should grab the @DA and draw trump before doing anything else and play North for the @HQ.|
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In this fashion, West ends up losing 2 clubs (since the @CA is off side), 1 diamond, and 1 heart making 3@S. Further, many inexperienced defenders would not overtake the @DQ but I hope most of you kibs now would.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am going to address what do you need to open 2@C. Of course you might have a 22-24 balanced hand, too strong to open 2NT. On the other hand, a strong unbalanced hand you need to be able to count 9 tricks in your hand given partner has average distribution.|
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You also need 4 ^*g:quicktricks::Hand Evaluation, Quick Tricks^*n  to open 2@C. 
^^North does have 4 Quick Tricks (@HAK and @CAK) plus another half a quick trick for the @SK
so a total  4.5 Quick Tricks  --  meeting the Quick Trick requirements.|

pg| ***** 143 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|To see whether the hand has 9 trick rules you have to use the "average distribution." I will use North hand as an example. Let us look at heart suit first.|
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


NT|^B@2
North has 5 hearts leaving 8 hearts between the other 3 hands. 8 divided by 3 is 2 2/3. So on average South will have slightly less than 3 cards in the heart suit. With AKQ98, assuming hearts break evenly, on average that will be worth 5 tricks. If South has 3 hearts, then if hearts break 3-2, North will take 5 heart tricks.|
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Counting tricks in club suit is a little harder. If South has 3 clubs, the club suit will take 4 tricks. But if South has less than 3 clubs, the club suit would only take 3 club tricks unless they broke 3-3 or the @CQ was doubleton.|
PG| ***** 146 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I would count the club suit as being worth 3.5 tricks. Therefore, North hand has 8.5 tricks. If you wanted to be an optimist and count half a trick for the @SK, you could get to 9 and open 2@C. And because of the extra half quick trick (4.5 instead of 4) I might very well decide to open 2@C.|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


NT|^B@2
North: I thought your tricks was 13 minus your loser count.|
pg| ***** 148 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, losing trick count, contrary to what some people say, has nothing to do with whether or not you open 2@C. 4 losers does not equal 9 winners. That is very important for you to know.|
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Kib: I have been told that it's not a good idea to open 2@C with two suited hands.  How do you feel about that, Howard?|
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


NT|^B@2
North: I also read 2@C not good with a two suited hand.|
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You only open 2@C when you can count 9 winners in your hand. I will get to the 2 suited issue in a moment.|
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


NT|^B@2
North: I guess I don't know how to count winners.|
pg| ***** 153 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I just explained how, although sometimes it is not so easy. You assume partner has no high cards but has the average number of cards in the suit you are counting. With a 5 card suit, on average partner will have 3 cards much of the time (because with 8 cards remaining, partner has 8 / 3 = 2.67 cards on average).|
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So with AKQ in your 5 card suit, that is worth 5 winners. With AKJ in your suit 4 winners, maybe slightly less. That's how you count winners.|
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


NT|^B@2
with AKQxxx partner has on average 2.33 cards in your suit (7 remaining / 3) so that is worth 6 tricks. With AKxxxx that is worth 5 tricks. Obviously, it's not 100% but do the best you can. |
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Granted, your  current hand only has a 3 loser hand (1 spade, 1 club, and 1 diamond). But that's not worth 10 tricks, but that is an awfully good hand. So if you want to open all 3 loser hands 2@C (assuming you have 4 Quick Tricks), I would not say that is wrong. However, many 4 loser hands are not worth a 2@C opener.|
pg| ***** 157 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So, with North hand, I think 2@C is a reasonable opener based on the "9 trick" rule. But, as previously mentioned, there is an issue with 2 suited hands which is the following.|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


NT|^B@2
When you open 2@C, you are taking up extra bidding room. You are starting the natural auction at the 2 level (sometimes the 3 level if your suit is a minor). When you have a 2 suited hand, you might not be adequately able to describe both your suits. So with a marginal 2@C opener and a 2 suited hand you sometimes open 1 of the suit.|
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If we make North's @CJ the @CQ, I think it is a very clear cut 2@C opener (because it would have 10 winners). Even with AKJ10 in clubs I would open it 2@C. But because this two suited hand is not quite 9 tricks, then 1@H would be reasonable as well. |
pg| ***** 160 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|After all is said and done, let's assume a 2@C opener is a good bid and see what happens.|
pg| ***** 161 ***** |


mb|P|mb|2D|mb|P|mb|2H|mb|P|mb|2S|mb|P|mb|3C|mb|P|mb|3H|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With a weaker hand and a diamond stopper, I would bid 3NT. But with 10 HCP I am thinking about slam. I only have 2 hearts though I do have a heart honor. Further, the 2@C opener will often have a 6-card suit and I do have a singleton in the 2nd suit. So I am going to bid 3@H, hoping we can get to 6@H. |
pg| ***** 162 ***** |


mb|P|mb|3S|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now partner should start bidding controls as she did.|
pg| ***** 163 ***** |


mb|P|mb|4D|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Technically my singleton is a club control. Had partner not bid clubs, I could bid 4@C as a control bid. But when partner bids a suit, you only count aces and kings as controls not shortness because shortness is a detriment not an asset. That is why I bid my next control bid--4@D.|
pg| ***** 164 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's assume we are playing 1430 (although I really think you should play 0314)

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The rule is if you decide to go for slam and bid RKCB you bid 6 if you have all the key cards. Or if you have 4 key cards and the trump queen. You should only stop in 5 if you are missing 2 key cards or 1 key card and the trump queen.|mb|6H|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|We are going to use the dummy to defeat the contract. Eddie Kantar uses a technique he calls "LSD" to categorize dummies (wonder where HE was during the 60s!).

NT|^B@2
Pard's got 5-7ish points. Look at dummy's long Clubs. Looks like declarer will be able to dump all the losers from this hand and next on those Clubs. When faced with a dump dummy, defenders have to take a very aggressive attacking strategy. If we're going to take tricks, it better be now, because once declarer is in, it's over.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|You start the play with two (slow) losers: one in Spades and one in Clubs. What chances can you see for avoiding one of these losers?|

NT|^B@2
If clubs divide 3-3, you can play three rounds of Clubs to set up the thirteenth card in the suit. Such an even break is against the odds, however. Can you see a better line of play?|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|You should lead the @DJ and discard one of your losers. West will win with the @DQ, yes, but the @D10 will be established to discard your other black-suit loser!|

NT|^B@2
This is a great bargain. You give up a Diamond trick that you did not have to lose. In exchange, you get TWO black-suit losers away. Two-for-one is a great deal at your local supermarket. It's just as good when you're playing a slam at the bridge table.|
