^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We were kind of unlucky. Further, 4@S is a bad contract and North showed better judgment than I would have.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|^B@2
One question is should West bid 3@H?|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


AT| It turns out they make 4@H which isn't surprising since we go down in 3@S. I don't think I would bid 3@H, but it is not as wild as you might think.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Based on the auction, West knows that East has at most a singleton spade and therefore is likely to have at least 3 hearts. That means by  ^*g:lott::Hand Evaluation,LOTT^*n (The Law Of Total Tricks)  3@H is a reasonable bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Interference over 2@C is rare. You need to have an agreement as to what partner should do. The most common agreement used by experts is somewhat counter intuitive.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*bDouble^*N by responder = no aces or kings.
^*bPass = a "positive" game forcing hand - at least one king or 5 HCP.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So using that agreement East should double with the hand.|mb|D|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


mb|P|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's talk about interfering over 2@C, It is quite an interesting topic. It is often a good idea, and is not done as often as it should be. The objectives of interfering are different if you are to the left of declarer or to the right of declarer.|
PG| ***** 36 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On most 2@C auctions, the 2@C bidder ends up as declarer. Therefore, the objective of LHO (left hand opponent, North here) is to suggest a sacrifice. On the other hand, the objective of RHO (right hand opponent, South here) is to suggest a lead. The 3@C bid here is excellent in fact, if not vul, 4@C is a possible bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My analysis is that it is likely that E/W have a major suit game. The question is how many clubs should I bid?|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


NT|^B@2
By LOTT I could bid 4 clubs with our 10-card fit. Normally I do not like to bid 4 of a minor when the opponents have a major for tactical reasons.|
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Suppose they bid 4 of a major. Am I happy or not? because I pushed them there. On this hand I am guessing they are getting to 4 of a major anyway and 4@C might be a good bid. If I had a singleton somewhere I would bid it for sure.|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A 5-4-2-2 is not bad distribution. Certainly better than 5-3-3-2. So in Matchpoints I probably bid 4@C suggesting a sac. I am not sure what I do in IMPs. Regardless, let me try 4@C to make it hard for the opponents.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Should North bid 5@C? We have 2 spade and 2 diamond losers. So down 2 doubled (-500) is better than making 5@H (-650). The question is, do we have 9 tricks?|
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


NT|^B@2
And the answer is yes, 5 clubs + 3 ruffs + @HA. But would they let us play in 5@C doubled?|
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Looking at all 4 hands, we should bid 5@C and with North's great distribution that is what I would have bid. In fact, given my 4@C bid there is an excellent chance I have a spade singleton. And if that is the case even if South has 0 HCP North only has 4 losers--2@D, 1@H, 1@S (assuming singleton spade).|

dirtysox88: Should I be worried that they missed slam?|
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding 5@C makes it harder, not easier for them to bid slam because over pass, East might look for slam perhaps bidding 4N.|
PG| ***** 106 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But over 5@C it is harder to bid slam. So I think, given my 4@C bid, 5@C is indicated although I suspect they end up in 5@H anyway.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|"Second hand low" and "cover an honor with an honor" are somewhat akin to "third hand high" and "always return partner's suit". These little adages may get you by, but won't see you through.  Rules are made to be broken, right? You might have guessed that you'll be defending this hand... |

It might feel a little weird to be leading your shortest suit against a No-trump contract, but with the opponents having spades, diamonds, and clubs, surely partner will have the hearts!|pc|hJ|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|What are your thoughts about this hand so far? Who has what? It appears that declarer might be scrounging for tricks - we do have the diamonds locked up after all. Let's look at the points. |
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You have 8 points and dummy has 9, totalling 17. It means declarer and partner must have the remaining 23 points, and with declarer showing at least 18 with the 3@C jump-rebid, that doesn't leave partner with much, especially now that partner's @HK has gone!|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
It is evident now that declarer must have, to go along with his @HA, the @DA K, and the @CA K. What about the @SJ or the @DJ?|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We don't care about the location of the @DJ since we have the diamonds all sewn up. As for the @SJ, we must assume that partner has it. |
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Why? Because if declarer has @SJ x, then his contract is cold and we don't want that, do we? |
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If declarer has @HA 10 x or @HA 10 alone we have just found a disastrous opening lead, giving East three heart tricks.|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
If declarer has @HA 8 or @HA 8 x then declarer has two heart tricks as the @H8 and @H9 are equals against the @H10. The best case scenario is that declarer has @HA x and partner has @HK 10 8 x x x.|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Ah well, you can dream, can't you? Whatever, you still have to think how declarer might play the hand.|pc|HA|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Oops, did you instinctively try to play a low spade? Don't worry if you did, because it's a tough defense to find. Why is the @SQ the right play?|
PG| ***** 141 ***** |


NT|^B@2
To play on spades declarer is very likely to have a doubleton. (Even with a singleton spade in the East hand the defense is the same). Now play it through... You play "Second hand low"; declarer inserts dummy's @S9 and partner takes the @SJ. And now...?|
PC|S4S9SJ|
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Sorry, there is no 'and'. Once that happens the defense is over. Declarer wins partner's second heart return, cashes out the spades and claims his contract.|SK||

What if you (correctly) insert the @SQ? |UP|3|

Declarer no doubt has to win this trick. If he ducks, we are certain to switch back to hearts and maybe partner can cash the suit out.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding: 
The opponents have a standard natural auction to 3NT whereby the 3@C jump-shift rebid was natural and game-forcing. |
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With the opponents bidding three suits, it probably can't be wrong to lead the @HJ, which happens to be the unbid suit. |
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It does feel a little weird to be leading your shortest suit against a No-trump contract, but with the opponents having spades, diamonds, and clubs, surely partner will have the hearts! |
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The play to the first trick went @HJ which was covered all round. At this point, it is a good idea to stop and analyze the deal. A good start would be to count (or rather approximate) the distribution of the points on this deal to get an overall "feel" for this hand.|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You have 8 points and dummy has 9, totalling 17. This leaves with 23 divided amongst declarer and partner, with declarer having at least 18 with the 3@C jump-shift (nobody said anything about the points being fairly divided). That doesn't leave much with partner, especially now that partner has played the @HK! |
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Based on this approximation, we can now deduce the honor cards that declarer holds - to go along with the @HA, declarer must also have the @DA K, and the @CA K. What about the @SJ or the @DJ? |
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We actually don't really care about the location of the @DJ since we have the diamonds heavily guarded. |
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As for the @SJ, we must assume that our partner has it. Why? Because if declarer has it along with another little spade, then his contract is cold and we don't want that, do we?|
PG| ***** 162 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now that we have a fair idea of the distribution of the high cards, we can follow it up with a count of declarer's tricks. That's right, you can do that as a defender too!|
PG| ***** 163 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Declarer has two spades (in dummy), the @HA, two diamonds, and two clubs. Where can declarer get two additional tricks from?|
PG| ***** 164 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Looks like it's time to defend the hand in our minds to "picture" how the play will go against the possible distributions that declarer may have.|
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If declarer is 1-2-5-5, then he can easily play on clubs for two extra tricks. If that's the case, we'd then need to hope that partner has @HK 10 8 x x x so we can take our tricks before declarer can get his nine.|
PG| ***** 166 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We can now give that a tick in our heads as we now know how to defend if that situation arises.|
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


NT|^B@2
What are some other distributions that declarer might have? Declarer surely cannot be 3-1-5-4 else we would have been defending in a spade contract!|
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Other shapes that declarer might have are 1-3-5-4, or maybe even 2-2-5-4. Let's first analyze the former.|
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If declarer is 1-3-5-4 then we'd have to hope that partner has the @H10 and the @H8 (else declarer can just set up his fourth club and a heart, with dummy's @H9 and his @H8 to force out the @H10).|
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So far, we have worked out that we do not need to get really "active" if declarer is 1-2-5-5 or 1-3-5-4, except to hope that our partner has the right cards.|
PG| ***** 171 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But what if declarer is 2-2-5-4? All of a sudden declarer has now another avenue for a source of tricks - spades.|
PG| ***** 172 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If at trick 2 (or 3) declarer leads a small spade from his, which spade should we play? To answer that question, let's put ourselves in declarer's shoes.|
PG| ***** 173 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Declarer doesn't yet know the location of the @H10, but he must play the hand in such a way that he will be treating our hand, where we led the @HJ, the danger hand. If declarer is going to attempt to set up spades, he will try to play a low spade to the @S10 with partner's jack winning, and ... ?|
PG| ***** 174 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Nope, that's it. If that happens, declarer can win our partner's return, cash out the spades and claim his contract.|
PG| ***** 175 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now what if we put up the QUEEN of spades? Declarer cannot duck for the fear of a heart through dummy's @H9 x, so he must win, cross to his hand and finesse another spade, hoping that we started off with @SQ J bare or @SQ J x.|
PG| ***** 176 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Don't be too discouraged if you weren't able to find the killing defense - it's certainly a very tough one to find. But the point still remains - it pays if every time you're on defense, that you get into a good habit of counting and/or estimating the points and the distribution.|
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You will then soon become a formidable defender! After reviewing all of the above that was said, it might seem like defending is a lot of work. That is certainly not wrong, defense can be one of the most difficult areas in bridge, but on the other hand it can be so satisfying.|
PG| ***** 178 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you want to improve, you must put in the effort! |

If you went through the Count and Plan, you should realize that you need to play one of dummy's top Hearts, crashing your @HQ.|
PG| ***** 190 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
You have a total of five potential losers; three in Clubs and two in Diamonds. If you play a low Heart from dummy you will win the trick, draw trumps, and ultimately find yourself stuck in your hand. Annoyingly, dummy's @S6 will not be big enough as an entry card.|
