mb|P|mb|1S|mb|D|NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The double is clubs and hearts. Four hearts and 4 or perhaps 5 clubs. The double is fine although it is a little risky in that we haven't found a fit yet. So it could be a misfit hand. Regardless, I think double is a reasonable risk.|

mb|2C|NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I do think east should pass particularly after north makes a support double. North has very bad clubs and nice spades as well as the @DK. The balanced hand is probably better on defense than offense.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I like 2@S slightly better than 3@H. You only have 3 card support and weakish support at that and your @HJ is worthless.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Your hand is barely worth 10 dummy points. With the same hand and a 4th. spade then yes, 3@H is better. On the other hand, I think they are likely down in 3@H, depending on how declarer guesses to play. They have at least 1 loser in each suit and could easily lose 2 diamonds and/or 2 spades.|

up|44|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well done. Using LOTT west might have bid 4@S  which is not a terrible contract. It basically is on a finesse guessing North has the @HA. And given the auction, it is more likely to work than not--North bid hearts. It is true that the heart finesse does not work on this deal. |
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, the point I am trying to make is that, because North bid hearts, it is more likely that North had the @HA than South and therefore the finesse rated to work. It happens not to on this hand, but that doesn't change my point. The odds of the @HA being in the North hand are much greater than 50% based on the auction.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, with only 19 HCP few pairs would get to 4@S. Having said that, notice again, because of the highly distributional nature of the East hand, 4@S has plays.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |

up|52|cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is not clear as to whether or not pard should bid 3@S. By the LOTT we should have a 9-card fit. However 4-3-3 distribution is a downgrade. So, although I don't hate 3@S, given we are vul, I think I would have chosen to pass.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What the partner of the balancer needs to remember is that the balancer is bidding on the combined strength of the 2 hands. Once it goes 1N-P-P, the likelihood is that the points are evenly divided between the 2 sides (although it is slightly more probable that the 1NT side has slightly more points).|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the balancer is assuming partner has some values, and, in fact, can bid with very little. Therefore, just because advancer (partner of the balancer) has a good hand, he should not assume he should bid because the balancer has already taken his good hand into account.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|^^^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is the theory of balancing. It does look like they make 3D (possibly even 4) so the -200 isn't terrible in IMPs. But, as I said, mostly because of the flat hand and the vulnerability, there is a good case to be made for north to pass.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|After 1@S - 2@S South rebids 3@H, which on the face of it is a game try. When North accepts the game try, thereby showing an upper-range hand for his single raise, South decides to bid a small slam. I am not a great fan of this type of sequence, since it is better really for South to make a clear-cut slam try. Still, how would you play 6@S when West leads the @CQ?|

You win with the @CA and overtake the DK with the @DA, so that you can throw your club loser on the dummy's @CQ. Your first duty done, you must turn your mind to the trump suit. The main risk to the contract is a 3-0 trump break. How can you protect yourself against that? |

NT|^B@2
The answer is to lead a low trump from dummy and to cover East's card. If he plays the S8 you cover with the @S10. Should West be able to beat the ten, the trumps will be breaking 2-1 and you will lose only one trump trick.|

NT|^B@2
Here a finesse of the @S10 wins and again you will be safe, losing just one trick to East's remaining king-jack in the suit. If East had shown out on the first round of trumps, you would win with the ace and lead a second round towards dummy's queen. |
