^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is a good play by North. At worst it is neutral and it forces West to ruff and shortens trump.

Of course, you should not give declarer a ruff sluff.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Excellent defense by North. As to the bidding, everything was fine. East's double is a smidgen light, but certainly in line with modern bridge style. West's 3@C bid is fine as well.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West has 11 HCP and East is showing an opener or close to it. And with a reasonably nice 5 card club suit, when partner promises at least 3 I think 3@C should be fine. Admittedly, the @SK is worrisome given the 1@S bid by North.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT|^B@2
North hand does meet the rule of 20. Even using bergen "adjusted HCP" where North subtracts 1 for the @HJx, 1 is added for the quality spade suit. So with 10 adjusted HCP and 10 cards in the black suits, the hand meets the rule of 20 and it did work out well for us.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We should not be in 5@D. We rate to lose 2 hearts and 1 diamond trick. Diamonds splitting 2-1 with a singleton @DK is pretty unlikely. Not sure of the exact percentage but guessing in the 35% range.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Over my 2@S bid 3@D is exactly right. North announced 10 points, and no major. 3@D shows that North is at the bottom of the range. If North had an opener, then 3@C would be a better bid. That would show a club stopper, no heart stopper, and an opener. With less than an opener, 3@D is exactly right.|

But we might not. On the other hand, if we are smart enough to play 3@H doubled then we get a great result. But that is very hard for us to find.|

NT|^B@2
Thus, keep that in mind when you are worried about preempting it is hard for the opponents to double you unless they have trump tricks especially not vul. Even if it turns out you are going down, you often will not be doubled. Let us go back to the original auction.|ub|11|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|We had a good question whether over my 2@S bid, does 3@C show a half a heart stopper? You many recall I have denied a full stopper, but a) 3@C shows a full opener and b) it says nothing about hearts. When I say it says nothing about hearts that is not quite accurate. |
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It does deny a full heart stopper becase with an opening bid, a heart stopper, and a club stopper, North would bid 3NT. So 3@C shows extra values, denies a full heart stopper but may or may not show a partial heart stopper.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In this auction, does the double deny 4 spades?|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That's a good question and it depends on your style. I would say it should deny 4 spades because although I will rarely double without 4 spades, the vast majority of the time my double includes 4 spades. So partner should assume I have 4 spades and bid 3@S (or 4@S) with 4+ spades.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |

Therefore, if you trust your partner a  ^*g:reopeningdoubles::All Doubles, Reopening (Responsive) Double^*n   in that auction denies 4 spades.|

PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT|^B@2
if I ruffed low, and the @SQ was covered with the @SK the suit would be blocked. It is not that big a deal, as I can ruff a heart to get back to my hand but it's just better technique to unblock the spades. Why give myself unnecessary entry problems?|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out opening 1@S rather than 2@S got them to a game that makes. It is not a bad game, on a finesse. I wouldn't hate being there or not being there. But if I were West I would have opened 2S and there is no way we get to game.|
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The importnat point in the play was drawing trumps ASAP and avoiding taking the heart finesses. The heart finesse is either working or its not. |
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


NT|^B@2Delaying drawing trump is not going to change that. But, in the board and many others, if you delay drawing trump you may go down even when the finesse works.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also, I was asked where some people play that if either partner or responder rebids their suit, even if playing 2 over 1 the game force is off. |
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


NT|^B@2
For example, 1@S-P-2@C-P-2@S is no longer a game force nor is 1@S-P-2@C-P-2@D-P-3@C.|
PG| ***** 118 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I think that is a terrible idea and I don't know any experts who play that. The idea behind 2 over 1 is to keep the bidding low so you have lots of room to explore for the best game or slam.|
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you play that 2 over 1 game force can be turned off then you will have lots of unbiddable hands where you have to either contort the bidding to keep the game force on or underbid by repeating your suit. |
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So you should play that a 2 over 1 bid is UNCONDITIONALLY game forcing. If you want to be able to stop in 4 of a minor, I don't like that, but that at least has a little merit. But stopping below 3NT after a 2 over 1 bid has no merit IMO.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|BTW, many people would open the North hand 1@D but I think 1@C is fine. Most play you open 1@D with 4 diamonds and 4 clubs regardless of strength. |
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


NT|^B@2
They also play you always open 1@C with 3 clubs and 3 diamonds. That way when you open 1@D you just about always have a 4-card diamond suit unless you are exactly 4-4-3-2. But I prefer opening the "better minor" which is what North did.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have 3 spade tricks, 3 heart tricks, and 2 club tricks. I need one more trick. I can try and set up diamonds but I could end up losing 3 diamonds and a heart or 2. I would have to be a bit unlucky.|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The other alternative is to play clubs. I will make a 3rd club trick 50% of the time when clubs are either 3-3 or one of the club honors is doubleton. I think the diamond play is a little better as I think losing 3 diamonds is against the odds but it is not 100% clear.|
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Another chance, btw, is that the spade jack is tripleton then I have 9 tricks for sure.|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|This diamond lead is almost certainly from @DJ x or singleton @DJ. We have five diamonds and 2@D bid by East promises at least six diamonds. A top five diamonds is unlikely as you see the @DA and @DJ.|
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


NT|^B@2
East, to overcall at the two-level on a poor suit, must have something outside diamonds. Although these things aren't certain you'd have good money on the chances that the @SK was on your right.|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|3NT isn't exactly a testing contract here, assuming that Clubs come in for five tricks (you have to overtake the @C10, of course, as the @DJ lead removes the entry to the South hand).|
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, as ever, there is the small matter of overtricks to think of. East's overcall shouldn't be made on peanuts, especially in a minor, with a suit headed by just the @DK Q 9. So the chances are very strong that East has the @SK as well. So – how do you play?|
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The French commentary was adamant that you must take the first Diamond or you can't manage the endplay – in fact, the author was wrong, as declarer proved at the table. What you have to do is to duck one Diamond and take the second (the @D10 is needed as an exit card).|
