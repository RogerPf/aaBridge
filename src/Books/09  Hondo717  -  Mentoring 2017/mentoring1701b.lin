^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Again although North's carding didn't happen to matter on this hand, on defense proper carding is crucial on many hands to finding the correct defense. As declarer you know all of the 26 cards that consist of your assets. But as defender you only can see half your assets.|
PG| ***** 11 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It is up to your partner to help clarify what assets he has. And the way to clarify is by signals and proper carding. I know there are some teachers who feel deceiving declarer is very important, but you should only deceive declarer when you don't mislead partner.|

rwloy:  My convention card shows from KJTx lead the J.  Is that not correct?|
pg| ***** 13 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is correct North. But on this hand, once you see dummy there is no reason to lead the J. The only reason to lead the jack is if there was an honor in dummy that, if declarer didn't cover your jack, partner would duck.|
pg| ***** 14 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But since there is no honor in dummy there is no reason to lead the jack. Had you chosen to lead a heart on opening lead then indeed the jack is correct because then you would not know what was in dummy. But in the middle of the hand, it is better to lead low. In that situation, you know at most your side is getting 2 heart tricks and it is better to let partner know you have a high honor by leading low.|
PG| ***** 15 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As to the bidding, although West is certainly strong enough to double and correct. I am not sure tactically what the best bid is. You can make a case for double, 1@S or 3@S. So double is fine.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT|^B@2
East has an interesting choice over 3@S. I certainly don't fault 4@S. But with the flat distribution it is a bit of a stretch. Obviously a singleton in one of the red suits would have been much better. However, you have to bid the cards you were dealt. And the double and correct to 3@S means 4@S is a reasonable choice.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT|^B@2
jordymil:  3@S, isn't a WJS?|
pg| ***** 18 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It's a matter of tactics. If West thinks there is some possibility that 4@S is making then 3@S is probably not a good bid. But if West thinks it is likely there are 4 losers in the hand then 3@S is a good tactic.|

dirtysox88: I thought we had a fit in 2 suits. |
pg| ***** 20 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is no reason for you to think that. Once West bids 3@S that is a double and correct, and the double in that sequence only indicates a strong hand with very nice spades. It says nothing about clubs. But with 4 spades and a very nice club suit, I think 4@S is a reasonable call with the East hand.|

PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If North decided he were too weak to invite, then, even with 5-4 in the majors, he should simply transfer to his 5 card major (spades on this hand) planning to pass the forced 2@S response. With a weak hand and 5-4 in the majors you don't worry about the 4-4 fit. You just transfer to your 5-card suit.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This sequence, going through Stayman first, and then bidding 2@S, shows an invite with 5 spades and 4 hearts.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North played the hand well. Once spades break badly, he wants to make sure he can take 8 tricks before they run clubs.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As to the defense, West has a clear club back, Why? Because he has long trump
and if he can make North ruff twice, he will end up scoring a trump trick by length. By leading a heart, East gave the timing of the hand back to North.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The heart lead set up North's 8th trick allowing North to be able to pull trump. If West had led back a club, it would have been much harder for North to take 8 tricks. He still might have done it, but it would have been a lot tougher.|

pg| ***** 51 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@D it is NOT a spade raise. A cue bid is only a raise if it is made by responder (partner to opener) or advancer (partner to overcaller). As opener/overcaller you can simply make the appropriate raise (raise to 2 with a min opener, raise to 3 with a medium opener, raise to 4 with a max opener).|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Therefore, there is no need for a cue bid to be a raise by opener and a cue bid is a stopper ask. Generally speaking a cue bid is a stopper ask, except when it is done by responder or advancer. I will give you an undo unless you might wish changing your alert.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good bidding by East/West except for the 2@D bid by West which we discussed.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As to the play, a diamond lead obviously gives North a problem, but I am not sure the @DQ is the right play. Based on the lead, I either have a singleton or doubleton diamond.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Therefore, East has either K10x or K10xx in diamonds. Either way East can finesse North out of his diamond queen.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So North might as well play the @DA followed by a low diamond and hope that; 
^Ca) Partner has a singleton (which I do) or
^Cb) East will mistakenly put up the DK (unlikely) because he thinks the finesse is losing.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In any case playing the @DQ does not help the defense. At best it makes no difference and at worst, it costs a trick (as it did here) |
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In fact, if I do have a singleton diamond unless East has a club void we are beating the hand because we will end up taking one diamond, a diamond ruff, a club (if East has at least 1 club) and a 2nd diamond ruff.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT|^B@2
North definitely should play the @DA and a low diamond on this hand that holds East to 4, but on a better day it will beat the hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|1@S is certainly reasonable. But personally I would open 4@S. Partner is a passed hand and the chances of making 6 are slim. Further, 4@S makes it hard on the opponents.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Interesting hand. Absent a heart lead, I may go down 2. Losing 2 hearts, 1 diamond and 1 spade.|
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Let's see how they do in 4 spades. They probably lose 1 diamond and 1 club since both red suits behave very well for them. Double dummy they actually won't lose any diamonds if West finesses the @D8.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Just looking at the East/West hands I would not want to be in 5@S because it is on 2 finesses (diamonds and hearts) which would normally be 25%.|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But on the auction, both finesses do rate to work. So 5@S is a reasonable contract. Not sure I would bid it, however.|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On the other hand, I would double with the East hand. East's diamonds seem well placed and given the 1@S opener, you can assume West has at least 2 defensive tricks. So down 2 is very possible.|

NT|^B@2 
Here, there would be no reason to make a weak jump overcall (who are you pre-empting?) and so therefore a jump bid in the Pass-out seat after (1x) - Pass - (Pass) - ?   should show an intermediate hand in strength, roughly 11-14 points and a six-card suit. |mb|2H|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|It's always nice when partner provides you with two aces. Plan your play - and don't forget to count your winners and losers.|
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In terms of top tricks, you have six hearts, one diamond, and a club for a total of eight. A spade winner can be set up for the ninth, but where's the tenth?|
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


NT|^B@2
"A diamond finesse" you say? Sure, that's not unreasonable, but is it likely that the @DK will be onside given the auction?

And let me pose a few questions for you to think about.|
PG| ***** 146 ***** |


NT|^B@2
1) Given that dummy's @CA is being knocked out, what if trumps break 3-1? (You probably don't need to worry about a 4-0 break, as unlikely as that might be.)|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


NT|^B@2
2) What if diamonds break 6-2?

Have a think about the above before playing on. It's always good to have a plan or two.|

PG| ***** 157 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
You were probably aiming (hoping) for a successful diamond finesse. Unfortunately it is highly unlikely for East to hold the @DK given that West had opened 1@D - what can West have to have opened the bidding (requiring 12+ points) without the @DK?|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|If you tried to draw another round of trumps with the queen:|
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
It's a nice try but there's a better (safer) line. You were probably intending to play the @DA and a small one after the @HQ, but if trumps are 1-3 and diamonds are 6-2, your LHO will be able to return a third round of diamonds for East to ruff. Of course you will overruff, but you will be left with an additional spade loser.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|The best (and safest) line is to lead with a small diamond!|
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
A 7-1 diamond break seems unlikely, and assuming West wins with the @DK, there is nothing stopping you from regaining the lead, cash the @HQ, unblock the @DA, and the final move of a heart to dummy's ace (drawing the final trump if they break 3-1), and cashing the good diamond.|pc|d5|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding: 
After (1@D) - Pass - (Pass) to you, the conditions of the bidding changes slightly. A jump to 2@H here is normally a weak jump overcall, but when you are in the Pass-out seat against a one-level opening, it shows roughly about 11-14 points and a decent six card suit. |
PG| ***** 172 ***** |


NT|^B@2
When East's Passes his partner's opening bid, it is evident that he is broke - therefore there wouldn't be much point to "pre-empt" (who are you pre-empting?) This is very similar to the auction of (Pass) - Pass - (Pass) to you. Now in that auction it would be quite silly to be opening 2x as a "weak opening bid" since if you had a weak hand, you would just pass the hand out! |
PG| ***** 173 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Play:
It's always nice when partner provides you with two aces. In terms of top tricks, you have six hearts, one diamond, and a club for a total of eight. A spade winner can be set up for the ninth, but where's the tenth?|
PG| ***** 174 ***** |


NT|^B@2
"A diamond finesse" you say? Sure, that's not unreasonable, but is it likely that the @DK will be onside given the auction? No, surely not. Without the @DK, West can hardly have enough honor cards to have opened 1@D. Therefore, we know for 99.999999% certain that the @DK is offside. |
PG| ***** 175 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With that information in mind, we now know that it is pointless to use one of dummy's entries for a diamond finesse that's surely likely to fail. Instead, we should try to aim to set up a diamond trick "on power" - meaning, we just need to give up a diamond to set up a winner in that suit! But what might be the best way to do that? |
PG| ***** 176 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Playing the @DA and another diamond will probably work most of the time, but we have to take into account of the possibility that West has six diamonds. When that's the case (as on this deal), West, upon winning the king, will be able to return a diamond for East to ruff out that winner. No doubt we will overruff but we can also say "sayoonara" to our tenth winner at the same time. |
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Therefore, it must be best to give up a diamond trick immediately. Yes, that will prevail against a 6-2 diamond break. And against a 7-1 split? Well, the last we checked a 7-1 diamond split occurs less than 2% of the time; surely we don't need to worry about that then! |
PG| ***** 178 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now that we have a plan, it's time to look for an even better one! It's always good to think a little further, not only to improve your own game but it also gets you in the habit of constantly thinking, thinking and more thinking. |
PG| ***** 179 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Presumably, we are going to win the second club, not the first, since it will sever the opponent's communication. It probably won't matter much on this deal, but it's always a good habit to do so. Clubs aren't likely to be wildly distributed on this deal and you are not afraid of a switch. |
PG| ***** 180 ***** |


NT|^B@2
After winning the second club, it is probably a tad better to draw a round of trumps in our hand before exiting with a small diamond. This way (at least) you won't run into a nasty (albeit unlikely) layout where East is 1-1 in the red suits and collects a diamond ruff. |
PG| ***** 181 ***** |


NT|^B@2
What you shouldn't do is to cash two rounds of trumps with the @HK and @HQ before exiting with a small diamond, for if West has three trumps he can ruin your plan by winning the @DK and exiting with a trump knocking out dummy's last entry before the diamond @DA is unblocked. |
PG| ***** 182 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So, you win the second round of clubs, play a trump to your king, and play a low diamond from hand. West can win this but no continuation will harm your contract. You win West's (assumed) club return with a ruff, cash the @HQ as a "just in case", unblock the @DA, and cross to dummy with the @HA to enjoy your second diamond trick.|

NT|^B@2 
There are four losers here, which is bad news. 
The good news is that the Diamond loser is a slow loser - meaning that the opponents need to knock out @DA and @DK before they can set up their Diamond trick.|
PG| ***** 191 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
It is worrying that the defense have a tempo here (if they play a Diamond at trick two then they will win the race to get a Diamond established). It is even more worrying that they may be in a position to maneuver a Club ruff. Still, all you can do is play on and see what happens.|
