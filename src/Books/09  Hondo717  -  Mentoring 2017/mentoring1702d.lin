cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|No, 3@D was correct. West, with the singleton diamond, took a conservative view. It turns out 5@D is a great contract, but hard to bid. So I don't fault West for passing with the singleton diamond.|

dkp1016:  What if I bid 4@D? I had seven diamonds.|
pg| ***** 44 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Then West would bid 5. But I don't think your hand is good enough to bid 4@D, not to mention it bypasses 3NT.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You can't but partner might have a hand where he could bid 3NT. Granted on this hand, 3N is not a good contract. An alternative auction would be for West to bid 3@H over 3@D asking East to bid 3NT with a heart stopper.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In that scenario, as we see East could not do that and probably simply retreats to 4@D. Bidding 5@D with the West hand is very iffy at best since there are likely 2 heart losers off the top.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In summary, I think, although 5@D is a good contract, it is very hard to bid. Sometimes that happens, when you have a nice fit--in this case, no wasted heart points.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East played the spades correctly. With the "8 ever 9 never" rule for finessing vs dropping considered this play works here. However, the rule should not be applied exclusively if one opponent has shown a 5+ card suit.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In that case, you should finesse the other opponent for the Queen even with a 9-card fit. The reason being with the 5-card suit, it is more likely that opponent is short in trump.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Also, it turns out the dropping the Queen even when there is no clue from the bidding is only about 2% better than finessing. The main reason being that, at this point, I have one more card in my hand (11) than my partner (who only has 10 cards remaining). So if you always want to finesse with a 9-card fit, you will basically do as well as playing for the drop.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, 4@S is not a very good contract, although it happens to make. It depends on dropping the @SQ (50% that spades are 2-2 or the @SQ is singleton) plus the @DA being onside which is also 50%.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So 4@S is about a 25 % contract. I would not want to be there looking at the EW hands as it will go down a lot more than it will make.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As to how to play the diamonds. A slightly better way is to lead low towards the 9 for the first diamond. If the @DA is onside, it will be onside on the 2nd diamond trick. And playing a diamond to the 9 may clarify the suit when a 2nd diamond is played.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT|^B@2
For example, if I started with @DQx of diamonds then East will still only lose 2 diamond tricks. That is why you "lose your losers early." East pretty much has 2 diamond losers at least, possibly 3. But leading low the the 9 at first will sometimes clarify what to play on the 2nd diamond trick.|

a) with 7 cards missing that is the most likely division. I don't remember the exact percentage (I am sure some kib will remind me) but it is something like 60%|
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


NT|^c@2
and as North astutely pointed out the auction almost guarantees spades are 4-3 because West opened 1@C and rebid 1@S which just about always guarantees 4 spades.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I can't take 11 tricks even with the ruff sluff. I need to preserve the trump in the south hand to ruff spades and clubs. If I pitch a club and ruff in my hand, I can't get to dummy without playing a heart.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The 5@D was a very optimistic bid by West and, in fact, if West wanted to be optimistic I might bid 3NT rather than 5@D. However, 5@D is not a bad contract. It is on a finesse. On this auction the finesse rated to lose.|
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I certainly don't hate being in 5@D although the optimal spot is 4@S. But preempts (3@C) disrupted the opponents and often cause them to miss getting to their best spot. |
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Personally I would have passed with the West hand. If someone preempts and your partner then overcalls on average you are expected to have around 7 or 8 points. Why?|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The preempter has usually around 7 or so and the overcaller has 13 or maybe a little more. That leaves 20 points or so between the other hands. Therefore, more often than not the overcaller's partner will have at least 8 points or so and with 7 HCP I would have passed with the West hand.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When preempting, some people consider having a defensive trick a defect but I don't. I think 3@C was a good bid as they can make 4@S.|
PG| ***** 119 ***** |


NT||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It so happens we can make 4@H and I might even bid 3@H over 3@D but I was afraid (and rightly so on this hand) that since partner rates to have a doubleton spade at best and they are going to be short in clubs they could make 4@S.|
PG| ***** 120 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So I chose to pass rather than bidding 3@H or 4@C. But I would not fault anyone who chose to make either of those bids with my hand. In fact, if I thought West was going to bid spades and my partner was going to be on lead 3@H is a good lead directing bid if nothing else.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|Dummy goes down and the time has come to make a plan for the contract. If the diamond suit is good for 6 tricks, your three aces in the other suits will suffice for game. What can be done if one of the defenders holds @DJ x x x?.|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
If diamonds are 4-1, you will have to concede a diamond trick to one of the defenders. How can you then get back to dummy? |
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The only possible entry back to dummy is the @SQ. How can you maximize the chance that this card will indeed assist you? |
PG| ***** 128 ***** |

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|You must win the first trick with the @SA. West, who surely holds the @SK, cannot then stop you from crossing to dummy with the @SQ. That is when you play two rounds of diamonds, the suit does indeed break 4-1.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|This deal introduces the idea of a positional contract. Never heard of it?|
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Well, you have now! |
PG| ***** 146 ***** |


MB|1HP2CP3H|AN|A good six-card Heart suit and a good hand.|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|A good six-card Heart suit and a good hand. Typically about 16 points (give or take a little). So how do you rate your partnership prospects now?|
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


MB|P|NT||lb|*bYour bid please.^^4N|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|You are easily worth a slam opposite a good hand and a good Heart suit. Even a hand opposite such as above|MD|0,0,S 7 3H A Q 5 4 3 2D K 5C A 3 2,0|at| would make a slam an excellent proposition - and that's nowhere near a 3@H bid. You'd expect North to be a fair bit stronger than that.|MB|4N|
pg| ***** 149 ***** |


SK|s|md|0,SAQ52H764DT9874C5,S73HAQJT53DKQ5CA2,SJT984H2DJ2CT8763|mb|P5H|AN|North is showing two Aces.|
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


MB|P|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|So you are missing an Ace. Still, you must bid a slam.
 
Careful, now. Which slam?|
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


NT||lb|*bYour bid please.^^6N|mb|6NPPP|
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|This is an example of a positional slam. When we reach the right contract it is trivial to play if the tricks are all there on top. What makes this hand interesting is the bidding. We watch as partner opens 1@H and rebids 3@H over our 2@C response. |
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With 16 points, excellent Heart support and a source of tricks in that Club suit we can hardly do less than apply Blackwood. Indeed, if partner admitted to holding three Aces we might well take a shot at a grand slam. |
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As it is, though, we learn that our side is missing an Ace. We must bid a slam - but which slam?|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


at| We don't know which Ace is missing but what does that matter? Let's try it out for size now, in the knowledge of what partner's hand actually is.|
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Suppose that partner were missing the @CA but had the @SA. Here 6NT would make and 6@H would most likely make too, except for the small possibility of a Club ruff. Still, 6NT is the better spot.|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


pc|DT|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Don't forget to Count your tricks and make a Plan.
If you total that up (in terms of sure tricks) you actually have thirteen on top with the possibility of making fourteen (!) should Clubs break. |
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Spades: Nothing here; 
Hearts: Six bomb-proof tricks; 
Diamonds: Three tricks on top; 
Clubs: Four tricks for sure, maybe five. |
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|In short, in 6NT you have tricks to burn. Now, you may want the fun of taking all thirteen tricks in this contract - we wouldn't dream of standing in your way.|
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
You could take them in any order but we decided to run the Hearts first (all six of them) and then cash four Clubs and then the remaining two Diamonds.|
