^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have one of those in between game forcing hands that are hard to bid. The intermediate game forces (15-17 or so) are the toughest to figure out whether or not there is slam. Many players tend to overbid with these hands. The general principles are:|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The average number of HCP for one hand is 10 (40 total HCP / 4). Hands that are close to 10 are more frequent than hands that are farther from 10. Therefore, more opening hands than not are in the min range (12-14). Since that is closer to 10 than a stronger hand. |
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Therefore, even when you have 16 or 17, it is still more likely than not that you should not be in slam. So keep that in mind, especially when you don't have a fit. Having said that, do realize that, absent a 1NT opening the toughest slams to bid are when each partner has around 16 points.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Kib: Why?|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Because it is hard to show a 16 point hand. Not strong enough for opener to jump shift. So when responder has 16 or 17, he often has no way of knowing when opener has 16 or 17. We could be missing slam here, but absent a spade fit and club fit I don't want to risk it.|mb|2C|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Declarer has an interesting choice after the 2nd diamond wins (East ducking the diamond). The spade finesse is fine but then the question is whether to try for a sure 4 by knocking out the D honor, as he did. Or to try and make 5 by hoping that both black suits are 3-3.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I like his choice of knocking out the diamond honor. But a more gambling declarer might hope that the black suits cooperate and try and make 5. That is unlikely but possible.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
In general, I think you should play for the sure thing unless your odds of taking a risk are better than 50%. But here, the odds of two 3-3 breaks is less than 20%.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@S is an interesting call here. I would not make it, because it does not follow the law of total tricks. Plus East has diamond points (a big minus) and 3 hearts (always a big minus to have 3 small in one of the opponents' suits).|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The hand really is very downgradable on this auction. The only thing going for 3 spades is that East is at favorable vulnerability. I do like to bid, but I would have passed.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


mb|4H|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Hopefully all of you realize that once partner shows hearts--by the negative double, the South hand grows tremendously in value.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Let's count dummy points (even though if I bid hearts I am going to be declarer, partner essentially bid hearts with the negative double, so from a Bergen hand evaluation perspective I am dummy.)|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT|^B@2
South has 11 HCP, 2 length points, 1 quality suit point for a total of 14 starting points and South can add 3 points for the singleton with 4 trump and 1 point for the doubleton. That is 18 points which is enough to bid game even if North stretched and only has 7 or 8 points.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
The point is, once we find a fit, South's "11" point hand is worth way more than 11. BTW, another really good feature of the South hand is that all the strength is concentrated in the long suits and there is no strength in the short suits.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Strength in your long suits is highly desirable. If the same HCP and distribution were, for example, @SAx @HQxxx @DJ10xxxx @CA the hand would not be nearly as good.|

Barbie1970: When I discard should I give attitude or count?|
pg| ***** 36 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally you give attitude. But here is one of those wonderful exceptions. You know partner has the @SQ--dummy has the @SA. Therefore, partner knows you don't like the suit. So attitude is meaningless. |
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT|^B@2
When attitude is meaningless, you give count. Another example of when attitude is meaningless is when partner leads the A from AK and dummy has QJxx in the suit partner led.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Again, obviously attitude is meaningless, since partner has the AK and dummy has the QJ. So in that case you give count. But in general you give attitude. The cases when you give count are rare. If you always give attitude you will be right more often than wrong. |
PG| ***** 39 ***** |

On the other hand, if you give count when appropriate (as on this hand) then you will become an above average defender.|

Once we establish a game force the principle of "fast arrival" applies. That means, if North bids 3@S rather than 4@S he would be showing slam interest.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West's defense was fine. But suppose he switched to a trump at trick 2 hoping to cut down heart ruffs in dummy. Also, note that I should not draw a 2nd trump in that case.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I need to ruff my losing heart in dummy. So even if West had lead a trump, I lead a 2nd heart before playing a 2nd round of trump. You should draw trumps ASAP on many hands.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT|^B@2
There are some hands (perhaps half, perhaps slightly less than half) where drawing trump immediately is wrong. That is why it is crucial for you to plan out the entire hand before deciding whether or not to draw trump (or how to play the hand in general).|

PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT|^B@2
What are needed to bid DONT?|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It depends on vulnerability and distribution. You should be least cautious when not vul against vul. A little (but not much) more cautious when not vul against not vul. More cautious when vul against vul and pretty cautious (although not as much as you think) when vul against not.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Also distribution matters. If you are 5-4-2-2 that is not good. If you are 5-4-3-1 that is better. And if you are 5-5 that is great.|
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT|^B@2
All considered,  if I was at favorable vul (e.g I not vul, they are) and I had 5-5 distribution.  I would bid DONT with even 5 points or so (if my high cards were in my long suits).|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With 5-4-2-2 I might do it at favorable with as little as 9 or so. But at unfavorable, I would raise the point counts up by about 3 or so. Having points in your long suits is very desirable.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you otherwise have good distribution, so long as you have an honor or two in each long suit, you can still bid. With North hand (having its honor in the long suits) the only time I would bid DONT is if I were not vul and they were vul because of the undesirable 5-4-2-2 distribution.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The same points with 5-4-3-1 I would bid DONT any time I was not vul, even if they were not vul. So DONT does require some judgement when you have a weak hand. Nevertheless, but I will say this definitively, bid DONT aggressively. Err on being aggressive. Don't be a scaredy cat.|mb|P|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Should East bid 4@H here? Let us count the declarer points. Again, remember that even though technically East is not "declarer."|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


NT|^B@2
When deciding whether to count Bergen "declarer" vs "dummy" points it's not really about whether you are declarer or dummy. It is about who has the long trump. In general, the person with the long trump bids the suit first. |
PG| ***** 88 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Hence Bergen calls it declarer points. But in some instances, the most notable being a transfer auction the person with the long suit ends up being dummy. To be precise, Bergen should have renamed "declarer" points to "person with the longer trump" points.|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


NT|^B@2
East has 7 Starting Points--5 HCP, 2 length points. Additionally, East can add 1 extra point for the 6th trump once a fit is found and 1 point for the 2 doubletons giving East 9 Declarer Points.|
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If west only has 15 (some people won't super accept with 15, but I will) then 4@H is a tad high. nevertheless, I like 4@H bid. BTW, the Law of total Tricks does apply more in a competitive auction and this is not exactly a competitive auction.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me undo a few bids so I an explain the bidding.|ub|7|
pg| ***** 143 ***** |


mb|?|
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Over South's 1@S overcall, West should bid 1NT. That shows 8-10 (occasionally a good 7) with a spade stopper and that is exactly what West has. It turns out that, because North has 6 clubs and can't lead a spade, 1NT is down 2 (losing 5 clubs, one heart, and 2 spades). But 1NT is a very good contract and, with a more normal 5-4 club break, will make even on a club lead.|mb|p|
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once West passes, North does have a problem. It looks like a misfit hand, and it is possible that South has no useful cards for North. Whenever there is a misfit, it is best to pass and keep the contract as low as possible. However, it is also quite possible that clubs could be a better contract than spades. |
PG| ***** 146 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Should North bid 2@C? One problem with 2@C is that I play that a new suit by advancer (partner of the overcaller) is forcing, same as a new suit by responder (partner of an opener). Many experts do not play new suits by advancer are forcing. |
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, if you don't play that then advancer has a hard time showing a good hand. The only way for advancer to make a forcing bid would be to cue bid opener's suit, and I like to reserve cue bids to show a limit+ raise in the overcaller's suit. |
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That is why I think new suits by advancer should be forcing, to avoid the bidding problem advancer has with a nice hand if you don't play new suits are forcing.|
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I personally would probably pass with the North hand, because of the misfit. But, as we saw on the actual bidding, 2@C works out much better, even if it is forcing. 1@S is a terrible contract. South will be lucky to take 4 tricks (down 3). 3@C, the actual contract, ended up making 4. So the 2@C bid that North chose worked out well.|mb|2c|
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| What should East do over 2@C? Some might think 2@D would be a good bid. East does have a nice hand, a quality 5-card diamond suit, and a singleton club. But he also has 4 spades. Partner did not make a negative double nor raise diamonds nor bid 1NT. |
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


NT|^B@2
And EW are vulnerable, NS not. I think pass is best, as partner could easily be weak with clubs and spades. Once again, my choice turns out not to be the best choice. If East chooses to bid 2@D, then they might end up in 3@D. That is likely to make.|
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


NT|^B@2
 The likely defense is South cashing 2 spades and giving North a spade ruff. However, the only other trick NS take is the @HA.|
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So what this board proves is that even experienced bidders can make reasonable decisions that do not work out.|
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As far as the play is concerned, I like the idea of cross ruffing. But I think North should ruff some hearts rather than spades. Ruffing 2 spades was ok but ruffing a heart at that point might be better. It may not matter.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|On this deal you will have to carefully analyze each and every card that is in your hand and dummy, along with your partner's opening lead. Don't lose focus, because the correct answer is right in front of you.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Given that you can see the @H9 in dummy, partner's @H10 lead must be from shortage - a singleton or a doubleton. |
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


NT|^B@2
No, before anyone mentions it, is not a good idea to lead the ten from @H10 x x in a suit that you have NOT raised. That idea went out with the Charleston.|
PG| ***** 166 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
If declarer has four small hearts, he is likely to rise with dummy's ace because from the auction, he knows that hearts will be 1-5. So declarer is favorite to have three low hearts.|
PG| ***** 167 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Don't stop there, you should next be thinking where your four likely tricks are coming from. |

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Play: 
After the @H10 opening lead, we can immediate deduce that this is either from a singleton or a doubleton, thanks to dummy's @H9. |
PG| ***** 181 ***** |


NT|^B@2
(And no, it is not a good idea to lead the ten from @H10 x x in a suit that you have NOT raised.)|
PG| ***** 182 ***** |


NT|^B@2
At this point in time you can already work out the distribution of the heart suit, depending on the card that declarer is going to call from dummy. |
PG| ***** 183 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If declarer has four small hearts, he is obviously going to rise with dummy's ace because from the auction, he knows that hearts will be 1-5. If declarer has three small hearts, he will also no doubt insert the jack from dummy. |
PG| ***** 184 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Next, you count your tricks. If partner has a singleton heart, we have two hearts and two aces. Too easy, so we can discount that scenario (as in, we know we have the contract beaten so we can stop thinking about it and move on). |
PG| ***** 185 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If partner has a doubleton heart, declarer will insert the jack as we win with the queen. That's one trick, and we will have two more aces to boot. Where's our fourth trick coming from? We know we have a second heart trick but this requires the hearts to be played again from either declarer or partner.|
PG| ***** 186 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Given the face of this dummy as well as the 1@S response, it is quite unlikely for partner to have a quick entry. Staring gleefully at two of your aces you will soon realize that you don't need that desired entry from partner.|
PG| ***** 187 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Your two aces give you control and tempo, therefore declarer cannot use any diamonds for discards before he can knock out our @DA. This gives you enough tempo for you to return a heart at trick 2! |
PG| ***** 188 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Rather than going for a second heart trick, why not opt for a heart ruff instead since you know partner is short in hearts? |
PG| ***** 189 ***** |


NT|^B@2
By the way, it is no good to cash the @DA to hope that partner has the @DK. Not only does this require partner to have the @DK, but if declarer has short diamonds along with the king, we can kiss goodbye to our heart trick as declarer can discard them on dummy's good diamonds. |
PG| ***** 190 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On this deal, declarer will play the @HJ on the first trick as you win the @HQ (also noting that declarer has three small hearts, since he didn't rise with the ace). You then fire back a heart, a play that will guarantee the defeat of this contract. |
PG| ***** 191 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If and when declarer calls for a spade in dummy, you better be quick to grab your @SA and to give partner their ruff while he still has a trump left. Yes, it would be quite unfortunate to find partner with the singleton @SK, but that would be quite unlikely. |
PG| ***** 192 ***** |


NT|^B@2
THE BOTTOM LINE 
1. The lead of an honor (the ten is sometimes considered an honor) when the next card below it is visible (maybe in dummy, maybe in your hand) indicates shortness. |
PG| ***** 193 ***** |


NT|^B@2
2. Holding the ace of trumps gives a defender extra options, Here, you seemingly give away a trick by leading a second heart, but you know the setting trick will come back in the form of a ruff.|

A few short notes on Joaquín and Concierto de Aranjuez

|CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concierto_de_Aranjuez,Concierto de Aranjuez - Wikipedia^*N|CP||FP||at|

The Concierto de Aranjuez is a composition for classical guitar and orchestra by the Spanish composer Joaquín Rodrigo. Written in 1939, it is by far Rodrigo's best-known work, and its success established his reputation as one of the most significant Spanish composers of the twentieth century.

|CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hclassicalguitarmagazine.com/the-truth-about-rodrigos-concierto-de-aranjuez,The Truth About Rodrigo's 'Concierto de Aranjuez' – Classical Guitar/^*N|CP||FP||at|

Jul 15, 2015 - The writing of the Aranjuez was sparked by a dinner in Santander in September 1938, a pleasant evening shared by Rodrigo, guitarist Regino Saínz de la Maza, and the Marqués de Bolarqué. During this occasion, it was suggested Rodrigo should compose a guitar concerto, to which he agreed.

Aranjuez also called the Royal Estate of Aranjuez, is a city and municipality, capital of the Las Vegas district, in the southern part of the Community of Madrid, ...
