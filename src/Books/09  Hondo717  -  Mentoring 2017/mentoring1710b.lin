NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N |cp||at|With a game forcing hand having one 4-card major and one 5-card major you bid Stayman.|
PG| ***** 4 ***** |


mb|P|mb|2S|NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had north bid 2@D, I want to show my 5-card heart suit to see if we have a 5-3 heart fit. Some people play a confusing convention called |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/smolen_convention.html,Smolen^*N|CP||FP||at| which I will explain in a second. But if playing natural bidding, I would bid 3@H over 2@D and partner would bid 4@H with 3-card support or 3NT otherwise.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The idea behind |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/smolen_convention.html,Smolen^*N|CP||FP||at| is that you would rather have the strong hand be declarer. That is an ok idea, but is not nearly as important as some players think. 

Using Smolen, had partner bid 2@D over my 2@C I would bid 3@S rather than 3@H. That shows 5 HEARTS not 5 spades which is why I said it is confusing.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But if you play that convention, then the 1NT bidder gets to be declarer in either 4@H or 3NT. However, if you don't play Smolen then your side ends up in 4@H, responder rather than opener is declarer. 

It is not a big deal IMO, but there is sometimes an advantage to having the NT bidder be declarer.|

at|Let us pass over the rest of the bidding and the PLAY and assume we reach slam one way or the other.  

It is not a great slam. You have a sure spade loser. But if the diamond finesse works,  or you get a diamond opening lead as you did here, you can make 6. As north mentioned she should have played the @DJ.|

In this board nome was the dealer and opened 1@H. You will see what happened next. His hand will be covered at first.   We will open it later. |

On the other hand, if you play ^*b Bergen Raises^*N,  you can have your cake and eat it too so to speak.|

The reason being it is likely they have a spade fit (and they do). South doesn't have 5 spades otherwise a 1@S bid is likely.. He could have 4 which he could have doubled particularly since there is some chance South is short in hearts (although it turns out not on this hand).|

NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not saying that means you should bid 3@D, but those are the thoughts you should be thinking as the bidding progresses. You need to think about not only what WAS bid, but also what WAS NOT bid. Spades were not bid. That is important to note.|

NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well the @DQ is probably worthless. So if you wouldn't bid it without it, you shouldn't bid it even though you have it. Plus you have a flat hand.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once again this hand proves that balanced hands are not nearly as good as they look. East was going to bid 4@S if I didn't talk her out of it and her hand is actually barely worth a limit raise. And as you can see, they didn't do well.|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Granted, although I do think west should balance, she has a very weak hand, even given her balance and flat hand. Flat hands are not nearly as good as they look. If you want to deduct 1 or 2 points for a flat hand with no singletons or voids and no 5-card suits, that would not be a terrible idea.|

AT|^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|On some hands it seems that you have little hope of bidding scientifically. You choose instead to shut your eyes, leap to some high contract and wait for the dummy to appear.|

AT|^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|This is part of Lebensohl responses to a take-out double of a weak-two. You respond 2NT on most hands with 0-7 points. If, instead, you respond at the minimum level in a new suit, this would promise around 8-10 points.|

AT|^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|A continuation of 3@S on the South cards would be a strong move but not forcing. South decides he will cut the auction short and leap high in some direction. You can guess what he bids, I am confident!|

AT|^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|If trumps were no worse than 3-1, you would be able to play two rounds, unblock the three diamond honors in your hand. Whether or not a defender was able to ruff the third diamond, you would be able to cross to dummy with the @SQ to take a discard of the @H2. What will you do to make the contract against this unwelcome 4-0 trump break?|

AT|^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|A valuable technique when playing a suit contract is to 'draw trumps, ending in the dummy'. You cannot do this here because East has four trumps to dummy's three. However, diamonds are 3-2 and all will be well if you play your three winners in the suit. |
pg| ***** 157 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|
AT|^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|If East holds three diamonds, you can cross to the @SQ and lead a master diamond on the fourth round, throwing your heart loser and not caring whether East chooses to ruff. East is no better placed when he holds two diamonds. |
pg| ***** 158 ***** |


NT|^z@3^b@2^^|NT|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|
AT|^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|If he ruffs the third diamond, you will win his return and 'draw trumps, ending in the dummy'. You can then throw your heart loser on a good diamond. If East chooses not to ruff, you again cross to the ?Q and discard a heart on the fourth round of diamonds. Twelve tricks either way.|
