PG| ***** 22 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But keep this in mind it is much harder to play a contract when one hand has all of the HCP because you have no transportation to the weak hand to take finesses and so forth. For example if declarer has 12 and dummy has 12, that is much easier to play than if declarer has 20 and dummy has 4. |

PG| ***** 42 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I prefer not to do that, because it messes up the Law Of Total Tricks calculation as it did here. On the other hand, with 4 honors, I think 1@S is not only reasonable but correct. Bergen says "You can treat a suit with 4 honors as being one longer than it actually is."|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't totally agree with that but it has merit. So 1@S is ok.|
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the defense we can do slightly better. After ruffing the 3rd club, North should cash the @HA if for no other reason than it beats the contract. It is never wrong to cash the setting trick and when North cashes the @HA I will encourage. I will then win the @HK and give North another club ruff.|

up|52|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That was an ugly contract as 4-2 fits often are. West might do a smidge better. If West takes the @SA, ruffs a club, and ruffs a diamond. That gives the @CA, the @SAK, a club ruff and a diamond ruff (although unluckily that gets over ruffed). But best chance at 5 tricks. That is about the best West can do.|
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East's other possible bid was 2@H which happens to work best. But if West had a singleton heart and doubleton diamond it might not work out so well. Basically East had no good alternative. I probably bid 1NT but that could be wrong also.|

But given West is a passed hand I might consider bidding 3@H or even 4@H.|mb|1H|
pg| ***** 72 ***** |


mb|1S?|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|lb|*bBid for west.^^3h|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Based on the Law of Total Tricks, West should bid 3@H. That is not a limit raise. 

2@S or 2@D would be a limit raise.|mb|3H?|
pg| ***** 74 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|lb|*bBid for north.^^4s|mb|3S|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North would often bid 3@S with a weaker hand. First of all, North should realize we have a 9-card fit because I bid 1@S over 1@H. 

On that specific auction (where the overcall is 1@H) 1@S promises 5+ spades. With only 4 spades I would make a negative double.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next, and let's count North's dummy points. We will completely discount the @HK because it is probably worthless. But even so 14 HCP (not counting the HK), 3 points for the singleton = 17 Dummy Points. On this auction, the singleton is worth probably more.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, I think 4@S is a bit risky but called for because of the 9-card fit. When you have a 9-card fit you should be more aggressive in bidding game. With only 3 spades and the same HCP, I would only bid 3@S. But the 4th spade makes a big difference.|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


mb|4H|nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2nome: 4@H doubled would be brutal.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


cp|8|AT|^^
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not necessarily. You have an 11 card fit. 

The only question is whether or not you should bid 5@H over my probable 4@S.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|lb|*bBid for South.^^4s|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What should I do over 4@H. The following is true. You should almost always bid 4@S over 4@H when you have a 9+ card spade fit. I don't know for sure that we do but I do know I have a singleton heart and little defense.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general 4@S is almost always right over 4@H. In fact experts call it "automatic." Here it's not quite automatic but it's close. If you always bid 4@S over 4@H with a 9-card fit, you will be right almost all of the time.|mb|4S|
pg| ***** 83 ***** |


mb|P|mb|P|nt|^z@3^b@2^^^B@2nome: I plan to bid 5@H now but I would like to hear your comments.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me outline what East should be thinking and why 5@H is pretty clear cut. He has 7 heart tricks for sure and a spade trick. So before we even think about anything else 5@H is down 3 at worst. Additionally, West almost certainly has a singleton spade because we bid 4@S over 4@H. So we very likely have a 9-card fit (or even a 10 card fit).|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, East can add 2 spade ruffs which gets him up to 10 tricks. So at worst 5@H is down 1. And if West has the DA or the @DA or even possibly the @CK (if South has the CA) 5@H is making. Remember good distribution is very powerful.|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most players highly overrate HCP and highly underrate distribution as East did on this hand. The Law Of Total Tricks is your friend. With an 11 card fit you can bid to the 5 level.|mb|5H|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|lb|*bBid for south.^^p|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|"5 over 5" decisions are very difficult. I don't think we are making 5@S particularly since partner only bid 3@S not 4@S. The question is, are they making 5@H and, if so, are we going down 2 tricks or fewer? We might have 1 spade trick and 2 club tricks. So I think I am passing.|mb|P|
pg| ***** 89 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it turns out, with perfect defense, they can take 1 heart trick, 1 diamond trick, 1 spade trick, and a diamond ruff for down 2. Therefore, 5@S is right but "the 5 level belongs to the opponent" is right more often than not.|
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


mb|P|mb|D|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't disagree with the double but it is not mandatory. North does not know whether I bid 4@S to make or as a sacrifice. Therefore, pass is allowed with the North hand. If we had a constructive auction where North knew we had game forcing values between us then double would be required (or 5@S) But here that is not the case.|

up|20|at|So no one did anything wrong on this hand. However, this shows you the power of distribution. Note that east/west have 18 HCP between them and the @CJ and @SJ are completely wasted. So they can make 5@H with 16 working HCP. As to whether North should pass 5@H I think double is very reasonable. But I would be a little worried.|

mb|1D|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This hand is actually slightly better than the 19 point hand the first time.
 
^c a)    It is 4-4-3-2 which is better distribution than 4-3-3-3. 

^c b)    It has 4 1/2 quick tricks which makes it worth 23 "quick trick points." |

I probably lead a heart but the @DJ is reasonable, looking for a ruff. In any case I can get rid of a couple of club losers. On that lead and friendly trump split, I have 11 tricks--5 spades, 3 hearts, and 3 diamonds.|

You should almost never overruff with a natural trump winner. Not overruffing often gains you an extra trick and virtually never loses you a trick.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As you know I can see the four hands. However, during these sessions I play as I most likely play at a regular table. On further review I noticed a better line of play which the hand makes regardless of how West plays the trumps. |
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us go to the trick after I play @HK. If I lead a diamond the to the King (rather than a club), I should make the hand. The diamond won't get ruffed. I should end up losing 1 spades and a club. But this is irrelevant to the point about West not overruffing with a natural trump trick.|

mb|P|mb|2D|nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@D is ok. As you already know responses to a takeout double are:
^cWith 0-8 you make the cheapest bid.
^cWith 9-11 you jump.
^cWith 12+ you cue bid (e.g. 2@S on this hand).|
pg| ***** 148 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You also can bid 1NT with 7-10 and 2N with 11-12 with reasonable stopper in the overcalled suit. East does have 11 but the @SQ is iffy and 3@D is awfully high. So 2@D is fine.|
pg| ***** 149 ***** |


nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My choice would have been a slightly overstrength 1NT. The @SQxx is an iffy stopper but that is why, with 11 points, I bid 1N rather than 2N.|

nt|^z@3^b@2^^|cp|8|AT|^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|An alternative bid for West other than double is 2@C. That is probably what I chose because I really dislike doubling a major without 4 cards in the other major. But many experts think KQx in hearts is fine for a double and would choose double.|
