^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That bid may work out ok. However here is why East should probably pass. Since East has 4 spades, West must be short in spades. West did not bid over 2@S therefore West can't have that strong a hand.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Having said that, since West is short of spades, it is more likely that West does have some clubs. Let's see how it works out. Given you are not vul, 3@C is probably ok. At worst it will be a small minus. BTW, West was correct to pass 2@S.|

PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In fact, in general, when you are missing the queen and the jack and an opponent drops one of them on the first trick. It is much more likely it is a singleton and you should finesse the other person for the missing honor as East did.|pc|CQ|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now the question is what should I do. Based on the first spade play (where North played the @S3, the lowest spade outstanding). That shows an odd number. With 3 spades it is likely North would have raised. So it is very likely North started with a singleton spade and East has 2 remaining.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The next question is, where are we going to get 4 more tricks? 1 spade, and a spade ruff is 2. We don't have any diamond tricks. Do we have 2 heart tricks? Let me play 2 rounds of spades.|

PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The @DK most likely gets ruffed but Declarer still is stuck and cannot cash any winners from the dummy. To be a really good defender you have to try and visualize what cards declarer has based on the auction, the play, and partner's signals. That is hard to do.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think 2@S is down 1--losing 2 spade tricks, 2 club tricks, and 2 heart tricks. So it turns out pass is the winning bid though it is not obvious. However, all considered, East has to either pass or bid 3@C.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In general I don't want to discourage you from competing and I don't think 3@C is a bad bid. I just think this is one of those cases where, given you have good defense in spades and North's strength is unknown, other than being short in spades
that pass might work out better.|

One time to open 2@C is when you have 22-24 balanced, intending to rebid 2N over 2@C. But that does not apply here because the hand is not ballanced.|

This hand has 4 quick tricks (the @SAK and the @HAK)|HC|SAKHAK|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


lc|SAKHAK|NT|^B@2
As to 9 tricks, it's close. I clearly have 4 heart tricks. I could count 1 diamond trick (although its a bit iffy). That is 5 tricks and I need four more. Spades should be the obvious source. In spades I have four tricks. And I am sure you will ask, "How do you count tricks in a long suit?"|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is simple. Let me explain. When you have a long suit, you assume partner only has low cards in your suit. You also assume partner has an "^*baverage^*n" number of cards in that suit.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The "^*baverage^*n" number of cards equals the number of cards remaining (13 minus the number of your cards) divided by three.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So here the "^*baverage^*n" number of cards is 2.666--|CP|1|fp|2|AT|^*Hhttps://www.google.com/search?client=opera&q=(13-5)%2F3&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8,(13-5)/3^*N|CP||fp||at|. You check my math by clicking the blue (13-5)/3).|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now if partner has 3 spades (we cannot divide the cards) |hb|c|wb|n|ip|90|bm|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1061/1924/files/Slightly_Smiling_Face_Emoji_Icon_42x42.png?16228697460559734940|at|^B@2

the the spades are most likely are divided 3-2 and you have 4 spade tricks. Of course spades could be even 5-0 which is very rare.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So optimistically South has 4 spade tricks, 4 heart tricks, and 1 diamond trick for the needed 9 tricks. Therefore, I would not fault someone for opening 2@C, BUT.|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||AT|
^B@2^*BMM: ^*NBefore we find out what Howard means by the ^*BBUT^*N, let us have a short review of opening 2@C tutorial |CP|1|fp|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=open2c^*N|CP||fp||at| from his website.

In this simple synopsis we look at only two methods.|

AT| 

A. You open 2@C a 22+ unbalanced hand when you have 9+ tricks in your hand (preferred by Howard Schutzman).|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


AT|

B. You open 2@C a 22+ unbalanced hand using Bergen's Method when it satisfies ^*Bhis "4 and 4" rule^*N.|
PG| ***** 75 ***** |


AT|

Method A is straightforward. All you need is counting your tricks. If there are 9 then open 2@C. One important note. Open a hand 1@D when the longest suit is diamond and you have 9 tricks. Howard will address that later.|
PG| ***** 76 ***** |

Option B (Bergen's Method) is next.|

^-|FP||VA|4|AT|^B@2^*BMM: ^*NThis section is provided by Howard Schutzman. More on this topic at the end of this presentation by Tommy Solberg.|
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*BHoward Schutzman: ^*N|cp||at|Marty Bergen uses the "4 and 4" rule when determining whether or not to open 2@C when your long suit is a major. The "4 and 4 rule" states you should open 2@C when your hand contains at least 4 quick tricks and has no more than 4 losers.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


AT|

Counting your quick tricks is easy. There are only 5 holdings you need to consider. AK = 2  quick tricks, A = 1 quick trick, KQ = 1 quick trick, AQ = 1.5 quick tricks, and Kx = .5 quick trick.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


AT|

Counting losers the way Bergen intended is more difficult. You do not use the common Losing Trick Count method to determine losers. You count what you expect to be your actual losers in the suit, based on an average length (with no high cards or help) in partner's hands. |
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


AT|

Sometimes counting losers is fairly easy. For example, if you hold AKQxxxx, that is no losers; since there are 6 cards out, on average partner will hold 2, so you will rarely lose any tricks in that suit. Even AKQxxx can be considered zero losers; with 7 cards missing, partner on average will have slightly over 2 cards in the suit, and with an 8 card fit, if the suit breaks 3-2, you will have no losers. |
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


AT|

As another example, Axxx is a  3 loser suit, because partner on average will have 3 cards in the suit, but a 3-3 break is not likely. You can consider AQ a half loser suit (you may or may not lose a trick depending on which defender  has the King). Similarly Kx is a 1.5 loser suit (which defender has the A determines whether or not you will lose 2 tricks). KQx is 1.5 losers (whether you lose 1 or 2 tricks depends on where+ the A is located).  KQ doubleton is one loser.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


AT|^B@2

^*BMM: ^*NEarlier Howard talked about the number of tricks. Here he used the same logic to determine the number of loser. Basically the same. Just saying it differently I take it. |

We always have learned better when we were at a table with real hands. So let us go through examples covering what we have learned so far. It would e a good learning exercise if we look at each hand with presented guideline by Howard. Please note, as always, some experts may not fully agree with all the bidding.|

Some experts like to play "Puppet Stayman" which allows responder to discover if opener has either a 4-card major or a 5-card major. However, discussing Puppet Stayman is outside the scope of this presentation.

                    2 club overuse syndrome                    
	  |fp||at|Saturday, September 11
Tommy Solberg
}^-|fp||ht|i|cp||CS||AT|
In June of 2009 I led (more or less) a discussion about when to open 2 clubs. The discussion centered around 2 hands sent to me by a reader. Rather than simply respond, I asked my readers to select the appropriate opening bid. The hands were:

|HT|m|at|^c  {|ih|pSSKQ432 HQ DAQ32 CAKT|at|}|ht|o|at|^mand |ht|m|at|^p  {|ih|pSSAQ876 HAKT2 DAQJ C2|at|}|
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


AT|

I got a lot of varied responses. The only things the responses had in common were that none of them were equivocal and all lacked any discussion of standards that would be useful to my blog readers in the heat of battle. Almost everyone vilified hand one [hand on the left] as a perfect example of abuse and overuse of the 2 club opening bid. Hand 2 [right hand] gained more support and there was almost an even balance between 1 spade and 2 clubs.|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


AT|

Always practical and useful, enter Marty Bergen who has it all figured out and reveals his answer in depth in Chapter 4 of Slam Bidding Made Easier (2008), my summer beach book. His standard for opening 2 clubs is based on a combination of Quick Tricks and Losers (tricks you would expect to lose if partner shows up with no help at all).|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Note that there is a distinct difference between the concept of "losing tricks" in opener's hand and "Losing Trick Count." Losing Trick Count (see my earlier blogs) is a valuable valuation tool when a fit has been established with partner, but of dubious value when there has been no bidding.|
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


AT|

Most of you know the definition of Quick Tricks since it has been around from the early days of Bridge. A=1, AK= 2, Kx= ½, AQ= 1 ½ KQ=1. That's it, and there can only be a maximum of 2 Quick Tricks in each suit.|
PG| ***** 140 ***** |


AT|

Now you are ready for the Bergen Gold Standard:

(a) If the hand is balanced (4333 or 4432) open 2 clubs only if you have 22 high card points. Opener intends to rebid 2NT.

(b) If the hand is semi-balanced (5332) or unbalanced only open if the hand has 4 or fewer losers and the hand also has 4 or more quick tricks. Thus in Marty speak, "4+4." Astute observers and mathematicians may point out that if you have only 4 losers, the hand also has 9 winners. Does that standard sound familiar?|
PG| ***** 141 ***** |


AT|

Marty is not going to open either Hand 1 or 2 with 2 clubs [repeated below]. They both meet the 4 quick trick requirement but also have too many losing tricks.

Open 1 heart. 5 quick tricks, but at least 5 losers. The hand should also be downgraded for the singleton A of spades. Aces that are not supported with other honors in the suit or are in short suits have diminished value. If you don't have firm control of the trump suit, you also run the risk of a "pumping defense" in spades.|

Open 2 clubs. Marty sez any hand with 6+ quick tricks is too strong to open with 1 spade or 1 heart.|

AT|^B@2
What is the downside of the "2 club overuse syndrome?" In three words, "loss of communication." You are starting the auction on the 2 level and by the time you get through with responses and rebids, it is no trick at all to be on the 3 level and not know much more than you did when you first sorted the cards. If your hand is one that deserves to play in game no matter what partner has, then opening 2 clubs is an effective way to tell him that. You don't need a lot of bidding room. If your hand is not that strong, then give yourself the optimum opportunity to gain helpful information from partner by a one level opening.|
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


AT|

What? Worried about getting passed out? Trust me, in this day and age good partners are looking for reasons to bid, not reasons to pass. Even if partner does not have a minimum bid, the chances are very good that the opponents will either overcall or balance. This sucker is not going to die, and on the rare occasion when it does, you are probably in the right spot.|
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


AT|

So what do we have? Marty Bergen who said "Bridge is a Bidder Game" rejects the current fad to reduce standards for forcing 2 club opening bids and goes traditional on us. When you have one of the World's most aggressive bidders saying "Pull in your horns", maybe it is time to listen. So consider making 4+4 your partnership standard.|

They are incorrect because both playing the @SA and playing for the Qx of hearts offside are against the odds. Sure if I look at all 4 hands I can always make. But in real life you can't do that. You have to play the percentages. And that is why you need to be careful when the hand analyzers say you can "make" a contract.|

PG| ***** 208 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Having said that, if it went 1N by West, followed by 2 passes then, in fact, I would make a 2@S DONT bid even with 3 HCP. In that case the odds favor me making the DONT bid in the pass out seat.|
PG| ***** 209 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Because if it goes 1N-P-P, odds are the points are approximately even between both sides. And that means if I have 3 points, my partner probably has a pretty decent hand, as much as 14 or 15 perhaps. |
PG| ***** 210 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Further, partner is sitting behind the 1NT bidder and all my finesses are likely working. Therefore, counter institutive as it may seem you prefer to have a weaker hand in balancing seat over 1NT than a stronger hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A rare hand where |CP|1|fp|2|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=gerberetc,4N quantitative^*N|CP||fp||at| is the best bid. That asks East to bid 6N with a good 16 or 17. But on this hand pass by West is correct.|
PG| ***** 212 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I am not a big fan of quantitative 4N in general. If you play it, you MUST decide when 4N is quantitative and when it is key card asking. Many good pairs over use quantitative IMO.|
PG| ***** 213 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I only have 5 auctions where 4N is quantitative--1N-4N, 2N-4N, 2C-2x-2N-4N, 1x-1y-1N-4N, and 1x-1y-2N-4N. Other than those auctions I assume all other 4N bids are key card asking. That keeps it simple.|
PG| ***** 214 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I see too many auctions, even with experienced pairs, where one person thinks 4N is quantitative and the other thinks it is key card asking. If you use my simple rules for defining when 4N is quantitative, at least you won't have any ambiguous auctions.|mb|P|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am going to teach you "gambling 3NT." If you have a 7 or 8 card minor headed by the AKQ and no outside aces or kings some people play you open 3NT. The idea being that even if partner has a fairly min hand he is likely to have a trick or 2. It also has the advantage of being preemptive.|

PG| ***** 243 ***** |


NT|^B@2
They can make 7@C because they have 13 winners--5 heart tricks, 6 club tricks, a diamond ruff, and the @SA. That's 13 tricks. |
PG| ***** 244 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In hearts, they can't score the extra trick with a diamond ruff because the hand with long trump is ruffing the diamond. They only get 6 clubs, 5 hearts, and the @SA.|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|The kind of dummy we are faced with is the tricky question. Look at dummy's Clubs. If we continue the Clubs, we set up dummy's Clubs, since he'll ruff a third round in his hand. He'll have two good Clubs on which to dump losers.|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|What should our strategy be?|
PG| ***** 260 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It's very tempting to see this as a SHORT dummy because of the singleton Diamond. The problem is the declarer and dummy are too trump rich for us to hurt them by leading trumps. |
PG| ***** 261 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If we're going to set this contract, we'll need to treat it like a LONG dummy and go on the attack.|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|There are many reasons to overcall in this game. One is the obvious one of trying to grab the contract. Another is to attract the right opening lead. |
PG| ***** 280 ***** |


mb|p1c1s|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Partner has a five-card suit (which should be decent), and enough to bid. How much is "enough"? Well, that's a hard question to answer. He could be fairly weak, especially non-vulnerable.|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|West knows that East has 6 to 9 points, so why is he inviting?|
PG| ***** 283 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
He must have 17 to 18 points (or thereabouts) and is asking East to leave it with 6 or 7, or go to game with something extra.|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Left to your own devices, you'd probably choose to lead a Diamond, possibly a Heart, but partner bid Spades.|
PG| ***** 287 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
He bid the suit - he must want them led. You must lead the @SQ (the higher card from a doubleton). It will give partner a count of the suit and will also unblock the suit if needed.|pc|SQ|
PG| ***** 288 ***** |


NT||PC|S2|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Defenders have to do a Count and Plan also. This one begins with a look at the dummy and a count of partner's points. How many points does partner have? |
PG| ***** 289 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Dummy's got 18 points, declarer probably has 8 to 9 (he went to game, remember) and you have 6. That leaves 7 to 8 for partner. That 1@S overcall hardly looks like it's been made on a great hand, does it?|
PG| ***** 290 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Anyway, assessing partner's share of the spoils is important to know and is the first thing a defender should do. This way, you can decide if you are on your own defending, and helps you place the cards.|
PG| ***** 291 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
The dummy is just about what you expected - Chock Full O' Nuts. Now, where will we get your five tricks? It doesn't look like much in your hand other than maybe a Diamond trick so you're going to have to rely on North's Spades. 
Having led, you can do little but await further developments.|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|On lead to 3NT we choose the @SQ for two reasons.|
PG| ***** 305 ***** |


NT|^B@2
 Firstly, it gives partner a count on the suit. He knows we have two, and declarer three. From three Spades (or four Spades) headed by an honour we would have led a low card (in fact, our lowest card). |
PG| ***** 306 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|The second reason is to unblock the suit. 3NT will always make were we to lead the @S3, whether East takes the @SA immediately or holds it back for two rounds. It's worth checking out the accuracy of this statement.|
PG| ***** 307 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Note that we do not consider leading a Diamond – an otherwise automatic lead against 3NT. Once partner has overcalled it is imperative to lead his suit. Heaven protect us from partners who "do their own thing" |
PG| ***** 308 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As it is, our @SQ holds the first trick. This isn't declarer's first hand of bridge and he knows he can run us out of Spades. His plan is then to set up the Clubs, praying that we hold the @CA and can't lead another Spade. |
PG| ***** 309 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Sadly for East, North has the @CA and cashes the rest of his Spades. There's nothing that declarer can do except ride out the storm. When it stops raining Spades, he gets the rest of the tricks, but that's only eight. |
PG| ***** 310 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Note that a non-Spade lead would have given East an easy ride to his contract. Suppose North had kept schtum and we had been on lead to 3NT in an uncontested auction. |
PG| ***** 311 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We would have probably led the @DQ or (at a pinch) the @HJ. Declarer would have been able to set up his Clubs, taking three Club tricks, two Diamonds, three Hearts and one Spade without breaking sweat.|
