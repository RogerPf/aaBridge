^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East has a dilemma. She hates to pass out a 1-level contract. But 1@S would imply 5 diamonds and 4 spades
and double would be awkward if partner bids 2@C particularly since East has 3 hearts. Further, West is not likely to be long in hearts. So pass seems to be the least of evils.|mb|P|

Also please remember, regardless of whether or not you play top of nothing from 3 small you must lead count in partner's suit when you have not supported it.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That bid may work out ok. However here is why East should probably pass. Since East has 4 spades, West must be short in spades. West did not bid over 2@S therefore West can't have that strong a hand.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Having said that, since West is short of spades, it is more likely that West does have some clubs. Let's see how it works out. Given you are not vul, 3@C is probably ok. At worst it will be a small minus. BTW, West was correct to pass 2@S.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That was the correct play in clubs although it did not work here. Particularly given the bidding, it is more likely I have a singleton club than queen-jack doubleton. |
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In fact, in general, when you are missing the queen and the jack and an opponent drops one of them on the first trick. It is much more likely it is a singleton and you should finesse the other person for the missing honor as East did.|pc|CQ|
pg| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||SK|S|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now the question is what should I do. Based on the first spade play (where North played the @S3, the lowest spade outstanding). That shows an odd number. With 3 spades it is likely North would have raised. So it is very likely North started with a singleton spade and East has 2 remaining.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The next question is, where are we going to get 4 more tricks? 1 spade, and a spade ruff is 2. We don't have any diamond tricks. Do we have 2 heart tricks? Let me play 2 rounds of spades.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|An expert defender after cashing the @HK would realize the declarer cannot get to the West hand and therefore will be stuck in own hand. But now if North plays the @DK, North can assure two more hearts.|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The @DK most likely gets ruffed but Declarer still is stuck and cannot cash any winners from the dummy. To be a really good defender you have to try and visualize what cards declarer has based on the auction, the play, and partner's signals. That is hard to do.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think 2@S is down 1--losing 2 spade tricks, 2 club tricks, and 2 heart tricks. So it turns out pass is the winning bid though it is not obvious. However, all considered, East has to either pass or bid 3@C.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In general I don't want to discourage you from competing and I don't think 3@C is a bad bid. I just think this is one of those cases where, given you have good defense in spades and North's strength is unknown, other than being short in spades
that pass might work out better.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Should I open 2@C?|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT|^B@2
One time to open 2@C is when you have 22-24 balanced, intending to rebid 2N over 2@C. But that does not apply here because the hand is not balanced.|

The other time you open 2@C is when your hand has ^*b 4 ^*g:quicktricks::Hand Evaluation, Quick Tricks^*n   ^*Band^*N   the hand has ^*b 9 ^*N tricks.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This hand has 4 quick tricks (the @SAK and the @HAK)|HC|SAKHAK|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


lc|SAKHAK|NT|^B@2
As to 9 tricks, it's close. I clearly have 4 heart tricks. I could count 1 diamond trick (although its a bit iffy). That is 5 tricks and I need four more. Spades should be the obvious source. In spades I have four tricks. And I am sure you will ask, "How do you count tricks in a long suit?"|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is simple. Let me explain. When you have a long suit, you assume partner only has low cards in your suit. You also assume partner has an "^*baverage^*n" number of cards in that suit.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The "^*baverage^*n" number of cards equals the number of cards remaining (13 minus the number of your cards) divided by three.|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So here the "^*baverage^*n" number of cards is    (13-5)/3    =    2.66|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now if partner has 3 spades (we cannot divide the cards) |hb|c|wb|n|ip|90|bm|https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1061/1924/files/Slightly_Smiling_Face_Emoji_Icon_42x42.png?16228697460559734940|at|^B@2

the the spades are most likely are divided 3-2 and you have 4 spade tricks. Of course spades could be even 5-0 which is very rare.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So optimistically South has 4 spade tricks, 4 heart tricks, and 1 diamond trick for the needed 9 tricks. Therefore, I would not fault someone for opening 2@C, BUT...|

They are incorrect because both playing the @SA and playing for the Qx of hearts offside are against the odds. Sure if I look at all 4 hands I can always make. But in real life you can't do that. You have to play the percentages. And that is why you need to be careful when the hand analyzers say you can "make" a contract.|

PG| ***** 107 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Having said that, if it went 1N by West, followed by 2 passes then, in fact, I would make a 2@S DONT bid even with 3 HCP. In that case the odds favor me making the DONT bid in the pass out seat.|
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Because if it goes 1N-P-P, odds are the points are approximately even between both sides. And that means if I have 3 points, my partner probably has a pretty decent hand, as much as 14 or 15 perhaps. |
PG| ***** 109 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Further, partner is sitting behind the 1NT bidder and all my finesses are likely working. Therefore, counter institutive as it may seem you prefer to have a weaker hand in balancing seat over 1NT than a stronger hand.|

I am not a big fan of quantitative 4N in general. If you play it, you MUST decide when 4N is quantitative and when it is key card asking. Many good pairs over use quantitative IMO.|
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I only have 5 auctions where 4N is quantitative--1N-4N, 2N-4N, 2C-2x-2N-4N, 1x-1y-1N-4N, and 1x-1y-2N-4N. Other than those auctions I assume all other 4N bids are key card asking. That keeps it simple.|
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I see too many auctions, even with experienced pairs, where one person thinks 4N is quantitative and the other thinks it is key card asking. If you use my simple rules for defining when 4N is quantitative, at least you won't have any ambiguous auctions.|mb|P|

They can make 7@C because they have 13 winners--5 heart tricks, 6 club tricks, a diamond ruff, and the @SA. That's 13 tricks. |

In hearts, they can't score the extra trick with a diamond ruff because the hand with long trump is ruffing the diamond. They only get 6 clubs, 5 hearts, and the @SA.|

It's very tempting to see this as a SHORT dummy because of the singleton Diamond. The problem is the declarer and dummy are too trump rich for us to hurt them by leading trumps. |

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|There are many reasons to overcall in this game. One is the obvious one of trying to grab the contract. Another is to attract the right opening lead. |

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Partner has a five-card suit (which should be decent), and enough to bid. How much is "enough"? Well, that's a hard question to answer. He could be fairly weak, especially non-vulnerable.|

PG| ***** 186 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
He bid the suit - he must want them led. You must lead the @SQ (the higher card from a doubleton). It will give partner a count of the suit and will also unblock the suit if needed.|pc|SQ|
PG| ***** 187 ***** |


NT||PC|S2|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Defenders have to do a Count and Plan also. This one begins with a look at the dummy and a count of partner's points. How many points does partner have? |
PG| ***** 188 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Dummy's got 18 points, declarer probably has 8 to 9 (he went to game, remember) and you have 6. That leaves 7 to 8 for partner. That 1@S overcall hardly looks like it's been made on a great hand, does it?|
PG| ***** 189 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Anyway, assessing partner's share of the spoils is important to know and is the first thing a defender should do. This way, you can decide if you are on your own defending, and helps you place the cards.|
PG| ***** 190 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
The dummy is just about what you expected - Chock Full O' Nuts. Now, where will we get your five tricks? It doesn't look like much in your hand other than maybe a Diamond trick so you're going to have to rely on North's Spades. 
Having led, you can do little but await further developments.|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|On lead to 3NT we choose the @SQ for two reasons.|
PG| ***** 204 ***** |


NT|^B@2
 Firstly, it gives partner a count on the suit. He knows we have two, and declarer three. From three Spades (or four Spades) headed by an honour we would have led a low card (in fact, our lowest card). |
PG| ***** 205 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|The second reason is to unblock the suit. 3NT will always make were we to lead the @S3, whether East takes the @SA immediately or holds it back for two rounds. It's worth checking out the accuracy of this statement.|
PG| ***** 206 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Note that we do not consider leading a Diamond – an otherwise automatic lead against 3NT. Once partner has overcalled it is imperative to lead his suit. Heaven protect us from partners who "do their own thing" |
PG| ***** 207 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As it is, our @SQ holds the first trick. This isn't declarer's first hand of bridge and he knows he can run us out of Spades. His plan is then to set up the Clubs, praying that we hold the @CA and can't lead another Spade. |
PG| ***** 208 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Sadly for East, North has the @CA and cashes the rest of his Spades. There's nothing that declarer can do except ride out the storm. When it stops raining Spades, he gets the rest of the tricks, but that's only eight. |
PG| ***** 209 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Note that a non-Spade lead would have given East an easy ride to his contract. Suppose North had kept schtum and we had been on lead to 3NT in an uncontested auction. |
PG| ***** 210 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We would have probably led the @DQ or (at a pinch) the @HJ. Declarer would have been able to set up his Clubs, taking three Club tricks, two Diamonds, three Hearts and one Spade without breaking sweat.|
