The bonus for making game in Matchpoints is not worth the risk. In IMPs however, you tend to want to bid marginal games. So I think 2N is ok in IMPs although I would not hate a pass.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The way North played it she risked going down in a contract in which 8 tricks were sure. And North did not gain anything by playing a low heart. So there was no reason to play a heart.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |

The only chance for an extra trick was to hope that the @HK was doubleton which doesn't work on this layout.|

pc|s8sjs2s9|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT|^B@2
North wins the @SJ. That is the 7th trick and since hearts are 3-3, ends up with 8 tricks I guess. Losing 2 diamonds and 2 hearts and a spade--the same thing. But the diamond lead makes it harder for North to win 8 tricks.|
pg| ***** 26 ***** |


up|16|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now back to a diamond lead, my choice. I definitely do not agree with the prevailing opinion of some experts that leading an unbid major is best against NT. 4th from longest and strongest (assuming the opponents have not bid the suit) works well for me.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On a diamond lead, you play 3rd hand "high", but in this case, since your @DQ9 surrounds dummy's @DJ you play the @D9 which is "high" in the sense that you want the @DQ to capture the @DJ and are hoping that bonnie has the @D10.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But in general, you play 3rd hand high. If dummy wins the trick you play attitude.|

UP|52|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the preempt did its job. It kept us out of 3NT and forced us into a contract that goes down. That is often the case which is why I strongly believe in aggressive preempting.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT|^B@2
To be a good bridge player you have to be an optimist. You don't worry about what can go wrong when bidding. You think about what can go right and take calculated risks. Aggressive preempting is one calculated risk and bidding close games is another.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT|^B@2
boater:  Do you always bid 5 in the prempt situation or only because North had great diamond.|
pg| ***** 50 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My double promises a solid opener and ostensibly 3 diamonds at least. North's Bergen Declare Points = 16. 10 HCP + 3 length + 1 quality suit + 2 for singleton. I should have at least 13 points.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So we have 29 points, enough to be at the 5-level. Again, with a preempt you can't be completely scientific. You have to take some educated guesses and 5@D is pretty clear cut with North's hand. I would be more worried about missing 6 than 5 not making. And if my @SA were the @CA, it turns out we make the hand.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East's hand is a little bit of a problem. With 17 HCP most players would be thinking of a possible slam. But 17 balanced points are not as good as you might think. Most players tend to over value HCP and under value distribution. But hopefully most of you use Bergen hand evaluation.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now we have an interesting bidding issue for East. There is a double fit so slam is very possible. The problem is 3@C and 3@D are game tries not slam tries. I play that any bids past 3@S, in this bidding sequence, are slam tries and control bids. Therefore, I would bid 4@C with East's hand showing a club control and looking for slam.|
pg| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East has 16 Declarer Points--17 HCP, one point for the 4 card side club suit, and -1 for the dubious @HKJ. West only bid 2@S, showing at most 16 dummy points and usually less. So they have only 32 points.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Further, they only have an 8 card spade fit and you should be more conservative when you have an 8 card fit. All that leads to 4@S being a good bid.|mb|4S|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I don't have a great lead. I shouldn't lead clubs or spades and I don't want to lead the unprotected @HA. So I will lead a diamond which doesn't work out wonderfully on this hand.|pc|D5|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


SK|E|pc|D3|pc|DT|pc|DJ|
pg| ***** 60 ***** |


pc|SA|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is the correct way to play spades. East is missing the @SK109. If spades are 3-2 this will guarantee only 1 spade winner for the defense. And if spades are 4-1 and the @SK is singleton, same thing as on this hand.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Even if spades are 4-1 and I have the singleton 10 or 9 which East will find out on the 2nd round of spades. East can finesse the @S8 for only 1 spade loser.|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So any time the @SK is singleton or South has the singleton @S10 or S9, the @SA is the correct play. And there are no distributions where it is wrong. |
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It is possible that North has the doubleton @SK in which case it turns out that East can pick up the suit for no losers by getting to dummy and leading a low spade and finessing the @SJ. But playing the @SA caters to many more distributions.|

North has a clear takeout double.|mb|d|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


mb|2S|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@S is ok. But I might consider the East hand as a 3-card limit raise. 2@S has the advantage of making it harder for the opponents to bid and once North doubles, the odds of E/W having a spade game becomes lower.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT|^B@2
2@S is a reasonable alternative particularly since an 8 card fit is likely. If East trades one of her hearts and makes it a 4th spade then East has a clear 2NT bid over the double.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Bidding 2NT over a takeout double is known as "Jordan 2NT" and shows a 4-card limit raise or better.|
pg| ***** 84 ***** |


mb|P|mb|P|mb|P|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I would have doubled again with the North hand. Letting them play in 2@S with an 8 or 9 card fit is losing bridge in the long run. So you should avoid letting the opponents do so.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is not an easy hand to defend correctly and many pairs would get it wrong, But by careful counting and analysis, it is possible to come up with the correct defense.|
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you recall at trick three I lead @C5. Therefore, North, after wining the trick, should decide if the @C5 is a high club or low club.|
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


NT|^B@2 However, it is far from clear. The only clue to help out is the @C3 is missing and the only club honors missing are @CK and @CJ.|
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
If South leads a high spot card (a "spot card" is 9 or lower) in the middle of the hand, that denies an honor (e.g. similar to "top of nothing" on the opening lead). If South leads back a low spot card, that shows an honor.|
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In either scenario cashing @CA would not help the defense beating the contract. Let me explain further. |
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


NT|^B@2
At the point that North wins the @C10, we have 2 defensive tricks. So we need 4 more (6 in total) to beat the hand. Even if I have the @CK (and West holds 3 clubs), we are only going to take 2 more clubs and the @DA for 5 total tricks. So in order to beat the hand, South has to be void in hearts and be getting a heart ruff.|
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


NT|^B@2
From North's perspective, there is only 1 heart remaining (the @H3). So either South is void in hearts or West is void in hearts. North has a good inference that South is void in hearts by the way West played the trick.|
PG| ***** 96 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So the proper defense is for North to lead a heart after winning the @C10. So long as South can ruff this trick, the defense will take 6 tricks (3 clubs, 1 diamond, 1 spade, and a heart ruff) regardless of who holds the @CK. |
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Because after ruffing the heart, South will lead back a club, guaranteeing 2 more club tricks for North even if West holds the @CK (which he happens to on this hand). There is no other way to beat the hand.Let us continue with the play.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If I bid, that is known as a "free bid." I don't have to bid, even with 6 points, because partner is going to get another chance. So I should only bid if I have something useful to say.|
PG| ***** 121 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Some might think that I should bid 1@S which is what I would have bid absent the double but I should not on this hand. Why not?|
pg| ***** 122 ***** |


AT| For several reasons.|
PG| ***** 123 ***** |


NT|^C@2
a) I have a pretty bad 4-card spade suit and East presumably promised spades. So it is much less likely we have a fit.
b) I have 4-3-3-3 distribution;
c) I have a very quacky 7 HCP.

So I have a pretty clear pass.|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Yes, I would bid 1@S absent a double. But once there is a double, I really don't have anything useful to say, and I don't want to particularly encourage partner with my pretty rotten hand.|
pg| ***** 125 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@H is ok. It shows 8-11 or so. But personally I would bid 4@H with a 9+ card fit and great distribution.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The @DA is certainly the standard lead here, but an expert would lead the @D10 from that combination. Because when it wins the trick, partner knows that North started with @DAKQJ10.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West is considering to draw trumps. The trumps are 3-0|NT||lb|*mWho more likely has the three trump ?^South~North^1|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Granted if hearts are 2-1 it doesn't matter how you play hearts. But suppose they are 3-0. Based on the auction, South is more likely to have started with 3 hearts. Because North showed long diamonds.|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So West should play the @HA first and then play a low heart to @HKJT. In this fashion West can pickup @HQxx in South's hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are 2 things to discuss on this hand. First how many hearts should West bid over the takeout double?|
pg| ***** 150 ***** |


AT| I would bid 4.|
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Again this hand shows the power of distribution and nice suits. It is quite possible because of the takeout double East has 4 hearts. So law of total tricks says we should be in 4 hearts. Also there is a tactical consideration. |
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Suppose East has a normal 12 or 13 HCP double. That means E/W have 16 or 17 HCP. Therefore, N/S have the majority of the HCP. Then why make it easier for them to bid?|
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


NT|^B@2
2@H jump by West shows an invitational hand 8-11 or so with at least 4 hearts. West's hand is worth more than 4 HCP. West has 4 HCP, 2 length points, 1 quality suit point for 7 Starting Points. |
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West as declarer can add 1 for the 6 card suit with a fit, 2 for the singleton, 1 for the 4-card side diamond suit (part of Bergen's hand evaluation). So West's hand, despite "only" having 4 HCP is worth at least 11 points. |
PG| ***** 155 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This is a really good example of where distribution is more important than HCP when evaluating the West hand. So personally, I would bid 4@H and would expect to make it more often than not. Further, it makes it hard for North/South to bid.|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


NT|^B@2
North/South could easily be making 5 of a minor. In fact, they do make 5@D unless East/West lead a spade. Anyway, this hand is a really good illustration of why you should use bergen hand evaluation.|
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We should appreciate that the 4 HCP in the West hand are the least of the story about the hand. The distribution is the key to the West hand.|
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As to the play it takes some planning. West can see that there are diamonds in the hand that need to be ruffed. So no trump should be drawn early. |

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Here you are about to play a slam. At first sight this looks to be a percentage play in a critical suit. However, is there a way of tilting the odds in your favor? At the time declarer failed to see his extra chance and the slam failed.|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|In terms of top tricks there are eleven (to wit: one spade, three hearts, four diamond and three clubs).|
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
If we can make four heart tricks then the contract will succeed. What is the best play in hearts?|
PG| ***** 170 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Taking the heart suit in isolation you should cash the @HA and @HK and lead toward the @HQ 10.|
PG| ***** 171 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Assuming that both opponents have followed with small cards it is better to go up with the @HQ. This way you will make four tricks whenever the suit breaks 3-3, whenever either opponent has @HJ x or when RHO has a singleton (so that there is a marked finesse). |
PG| ***** 172 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Total odds, about 54% or so. Is there, however, an extra chance on this deal? Let us proceed.|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|You should play small spade and duck on first round. There are two reasons for this.|
PG| ***** 176 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
One is to tighten the position for a squeeze (known in the trade as rectifying the count).|

The other is that it may enable you, later in the hand, to be able to count the East-West hands. I will explain after the play.|

up|52|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|6NT is the spot here - a decent contract that appears to hang on the Heart suit coming in for four tricks. |
PG| ***** 195 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The French commentator suggested that West would naturally lead the @SK and that the right play is to duck it (completely correct). After this, just running off all the minor suit winners would squeeze the life out of West.|
PG| ***** 196 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I agree with this analysis entirely - except that I think that the @SK lead is dangerous against 6NT bid in this fashion. If you reverse the @SJ and @SA that lead would give away the contract trivially. |
PG| ***** 197 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I was West on this hand and led a Club - so I have set this deal up in the way the hand was played at the table.|
PG| ***** 198 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now the play is not so easy. Declarer looked at the ceiling for inspiration, cashed all his winners and eventually, with suspicious glances at both of his opponents, took the percentage line in Hearts and played for the drop. One down. What did he miss?|
PG| ***** 199 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Well, in these hands it would have cost him nothing to have ducked a Spade early on. Apart from the unlikely possibility of finding an opponent with @SK Q alone he would have found a squeeze position if either opponent hand started with the @SK Q and four Hearts to the @HJ (as here). |
PG| ***** 200 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Also, ducking a trick early (to rectify the count, as it's known) might have also enabled declarer to count the hand in certain layouts and enabled him to finesse in Hearts in the endgame. Not on this layout, of course, but on others.|
PG| ***** 201 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you not au fait (French again - remember where we are!) with squeezes and find them difficult this hand is a good one to help you understand the basic techniques. |
PG| ***** 202 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In essence, you should be one trick short of your contract and should have lost all the tricks necessary before you run your winners. |
PG| ***** 203 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That's over-simplifying matters but here you can see the effect of ducking a Spade and of not ducking a Spade early. If you just play off your winners West doesn't have to throw away one of his winners in the endgame.|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|To make 4@H you needed East to have the @HA and the trumps to break 3-2. This has come to pass, so this contract is coming home.|
PG| ***** 234 ***** |


NT|^B@2
North opens 1@C and we have 10 points with 4-4 in the majors. Following the principle that we respond up-the-line with four-card suits, we reply 1@H. Partner appears to like that because he makes a strong raise - jumping to 3@H. |
PG| ***** 235 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This bid isn't forcing - we could Pass with a minimum response. However, with 10 points we know we have something in excess of 25 between us, and a 4-4 major-suit fit, so we happily advance to game.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|West leads the @DQ against 4@H and we must take time to Count and Plan. |
PG| ***** 237 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Our count of losers shows us that two Diamonds will have to be lost (no one leads the @DQ against a suit contract when holding the @DA. So success in 4@H will come down to not losing two trump tricks.|
PG| ***** 238 ***** |


NT|^B@2
There are more than enough winners once trumps have been drawn. That is not the issue on this hand. The focus is on handling trumps accurately. |
PG| ***** 239 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The essence here is to play for two things - firstly that trumps break 3-2 and secondly that East holds the @HA. |
PG| ***** 240 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This is against the odds but there is nothing in The Laws of Contract Bridge against trying and hoping. (There's nothing against being lucky, either). |
PG| ***** 241 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Correct play entails leading up to the @HK and @HQ twice, making use of the entries on the table. The key (as in all finesses) is to lead through our victim toward our high cards. |
PG| ***** 242 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Whether we put the @DK up at trick one or not is irrelevant - whatever we do East-West take the first two Diamonds and then play a Spade. Best is to take the @SA and play a small Heart toward the @HK.|
PG| ***** 243 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We would love East to play the @HA on air - does he? No! He has played the game before. Aces are built for killing Kings. Right then - back to dummy with a Club and another Heart, through East's holding.|
PG| ***** 244 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We succeed because the trumps lie well for us - we require East to hold the Ace of trumps and for the suit to split 3-2. If that were not the case, we'd fail, with as much dignity and sangfroid as we could manage.|
