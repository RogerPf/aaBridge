^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Several comments on the play.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West should have strongly considered unblocking the @HK at trick 1. It is unlikely North has the @HJ because then a low heart at trick 1 makes more sense. What happened here is West blocked the heart suit.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As declarer I would play a low heart at trick 1. No reason to play the @HA right away and West might find it difficult to play back a heart.|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT|^B@2
KIWI_2o1: I played for Heart block. If play low then easy to play H's. Is that correct?|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not really. In fact, its easier to defend correctly when you played the @HA. If you play low, then West might easily assume you have the @HJ and won't lead back a low heart.But when you play the @HA, it is pretty clear you don't have the @HJ.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| Also, when playing diamonds, better to lead low towards the @DK109. In general it is better to lead low toward an honor than an honor. Although with @J1097 between the 2 hands in diamonds, it is likely not to matter.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If the @D8 is 4th (as it is on this hand) it might matter. If you lead low towards the @K109, then the @D8 is never set up.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The reason it is better to lead low in general than an honor is because if you lead an honor and it is covered then you are using 2 of your honors to draw one of the opponents.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But if you lead low towards an honor, you are only using 1 of your honors to drive out an opponents honor. So generally speaking, unless you have a strong honor sequence, leading low is better than leading an honor when taking a finesse.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Finally, I am not sure the hand makes anyway, but I think leading a low diamond does help.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me comment on the auction before we play the hand. The Kx of diamonds is not a particularly good diamond holding opposite a splinter. The King could easily be wasted (although the double here makes that less likely).|
PG| ***** 37 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A desirable holding opposite a splinter is 3 or 4 small or 3 or 4 to the @DA. But even though the @DK does not fit well with partner and 2 diamonds is not as good as 3 or 4 diamonds East still has a great hand.|
PG| ***** 38 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So East should control bid as East did. Even if West then bids 4@S, I would still explore for slam with the East hand.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Since East has all suits controlled on this auction, however, West is very happy to hear the 4@H bid. And can just bid 4N RKCB since West has clubs controlled.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT|^B@2
East has 2 key cards and the @SQ assuming they are playing RKCb. It is superior to standard Blackwood because you can also show the the King and the Queen of the trump--@SK and @SQ.|
PG| ***** 41 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So playing RKCb, your response is 5@S, showing 2 key cards (the @HA and @SK on this hand) and the @SQ.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have an interesting problem here. Based on the auction, I know partner has long spades because East did not raise spades and East likely has no more than 2 meaning partner has at least 4.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Shall I double? If I double, do I want partner to consider passing? I am a bit weak for a double and were I not a passed hand the decision whether or not to double would be harder.|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But I have a clear double. I do have 2 likely defensive tricks (the @HA and @CK). They are vul and we are not, so if partner passes and we beat them we are getting at least 200 and 500 is a real possibility. As I have already passed, partner knows I have less than an opener.|mb|D|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West was unlucky. West had a reasonable 2@S bid. A maximum in fact.

PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It didn't happen to work out in spite a good 2@S bid. But more often than not preempts work. And when they don't work, having a stronger Weak-2 is no protection against a bad result.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So don't worry about preempting with weaker hands. Stronger hands don't necessarily protect you from being doubled, as this hand illustrates. Preempts are high reward bids with some risk. But the rewards far outweigh the risks in the long run.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to whether we can make 4@H, we probably can. Losing 2 diamonds and perhaps 1 heart. But doubled down 3 vul is a much better result for us.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |

CarlieG: When do you double when you are sitting to the left of the bidder and have good trump suit?|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You can never make a penalty double. So with spades in this hand, North's only 2 choices are pass and 2NT if strong enough.|
PG| ***** 87 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That is why South has to "protect" against North having a penalty double when South is short of spades. Whenever an opponent bids a suit and it goes pass-pass if you are short in the opponent's suit, you must consider the possibility that partner has a penalty double and strain to make a takeout double that can be converted to a penalty double.|

PG| ***** 109 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As it turns out and you will see when the four hands are shown, because diamonds behave, and clubs behave they can make 12 tricks. They take 4 spades, 1 heart, 4 diamonds, and 3 clubs for 12 tricks. |
PG| ***** 110 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But it requires the @DJ to drop in 3 rounds and the @CQ to be onside  which is pretty unlikely; about 25%. You don't want to bid 25% slams. Let us undo and have East bid 3N.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The @CA is reasonable play and were it the 9th trick, it is the correct play. But since 3NT has already been made I think the @CJ is a better play. Yes, if North has the @H10 and the @CQ left, then West makes 4 instead of 5.|
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But given the discards and the fact that, were West watching carefully, it can be worked out that North started with 6 hearts, 4 diamonds, 1 spade, and 2 clubs. And since North already threw a club the club finesse is marked.|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |

Given 3N is so easy, I am not sure even I would have bothered to count out the North hand if I were West. But it can be done and an expert would have done so if it mattered.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@S is an ok bid and so is 1@S. The hand does meet ^*b The Rule of 20^*N, ^*g:ruleof20::Hand Evaluation, (LINK  -  Rule of 20 Tutorial)^*n  with 10 HCP and 6-4 in the black suits and an ace and king outside.|

But I think 2@S is OK because any time you have 10 HCP which meet the rule of 20 it is ok if you decide to open a pre-empt rather than one of the suit particularly if Spades is the suit.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|This is an example of a SHORT dummy. Pausing to look at the dummy reveals that the declarer will use the dummy to trump losers. (How does declarer get rid of losers? By trumping or dumping them in dummy.)|
PG| ***** 192 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The defense strategy for a SHORT dummy is to lead trumps. Kill the dummy. Unlike a LONG dummy, where we need to attack getting our tricks (or setting them up) fast, here we are going to pull declarer's teeth. Er, trumps. |

We need four tricks to set the rascals. Let's begin our defenders' Count and Plan with a count of Partner's points and a good look at the dummy. What do you see?|
PG| ***** 200 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With the declarer holding about 19ish points, the dummy with 5, and our 14, that leaves Pard with not much. We wonder how much distribution enters declarer's count.|

To plan a suit contract, you look at the potential losers in the long-trump (South) hand.|

Here you start with no trump losers, one Heart loser that can be ruffed, one Diamond loser and one Club loser. What chance or chances can you see of avoiding the Club loser?|

One chance is to lead towards the @DK. If West holds the @DA, you can establish the @DK to provide a discard for your Club loser. Can you see an additional chance?|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|We reach 6@S after overbidding the South cards and West leads a trump. |
PG| ***** 254 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We can ruff our Heart loser in dummy (in the short trump hand). We expect to lose a Diamond and must make plans for our Club loser. One obvious chance is that the @DA lies with West. In that case we can lead towards the @DK and establish that card for a Club discard. |
PG| ***** 255 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A second (almost hidden) chance is that Diamonds break 4-3 and we can set up the thirteenth Diamond for a Club discard. This will require a good number of entries to dummy. It is therefore essential that we win the trump lead in our hand and play a Diamond immediately. |
PG| ***** 256 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The @DK loses to East's @DA but we have enough entries to set up the @D9 and then discard our losing Club.|
