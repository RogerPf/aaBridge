^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Pass is fine. But particularly at favorable vulnerability, I would bid 2@D. You need at least 10 HCP or so and a nice suit to overcall at the 2-level. The more HCP, the weaker your suit can be. You have 12 HCP, including the favorably placed @HAQ (based on the 1@H opening bid). Your suit is a bit weak, particularly since it lacks intermediate cards but I still think it is strong enough given your 12 HCP.|mb|P|

PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West has the strength but the suit is weak. Regardless, I probably still bid 2@D given they are not vul and we are vul. In that case they would end up in 3@D. They probably lose 3 spades, 2 diamonds, and a club

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding was fine and not much East could do. We have 8 tricks once we gain the lead. BTW 1NT over 1@D is one of my least favorite bids.

PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Therefore because I play that, I will very occasionally have to bid 1@D over 1@C with a 3-card diamond suit and 6-7 points and no 4-card major. It's rare. But I do like playing 1N over 1@C as 8-10 so I am willing to live with occasionally having to bid a 3-card diamond suit.|

qx|NMF|ht|b|fp|1|at|^-New Minor Forcing by Erick Rodwell - an Excerpt
^-|ht|d|fp||at|^b@2Recently, Eric Rodwell who does not need an introduction has his first book--Bidding Topics. In April 2017 it was publicized by |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttps://www.baronbarclay.com/,Baron Barclay^*N|CP||FP||at| by emails. 

The freebie part from the book is an excerpt on New Minor Forcing. It is short and simple. In the next several panels the material is outlined Using Howard Schutzman Viewer application. Further, |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=nmf,New Minor Focing^*N|CP||FP||at| tutorial by Howard is a must read for aspiring bridge players. 

^b@2New minor forcing ('NMF') is a convention used on the second round of bidding by responder after opener has rebid 1NT. 

In the original version, it was a bid of 2@C (2@D if that is the 'new minor', i.e. the opening was 1@C) when the response was in a major:|cs|6|

ht|n|at|^B{|ia|o1c1s1n!2d|at|}|ht|n|at|^k{|ia|o1h1s1n!2c|at|}|
at|^^
^BThe 2@D in the above auction is NMF ^kThe 2@c in the above auction is NMF

NMF is primarily used to discover if opener has 3-card support for the major. To locate a 5-3 fit.^*B Using NMF promises at least game invitational values^*N. 

On many hands, responder will next bid 4 of the major if opener shows support, or 3NT if he does not.

ht|b|fp|1|at|^-New Minor Forcing - an Introduction
Which does opener show first-3-card spade support, 
or 4 hearts ?
^-|ht|f|fp||at|^b@2
If opener has both 3 spades and 4 hearts, there is no real consensus on which he shows first. Some are very determined that opener must show the 4-card heart suit first, on the theory that a 4-4 heart fit will play better than a 5-3 spade fit. I disagree with this for several reasons:|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


AT|

1. It often plays better in a 5-3 or 6-3 fit than a 4-4 fit.
2. If responder is not interested in a 4-4 heart fit, then opener's 2@S bid tells him what he needs to know.
3. If responder is determined to find a 4-4 heart fit, he can continue over opener's 2@S bid with a natural 3@h.|

fp|1|at|^^^- Howard's View ^-|fp||

cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Rodwell has provided an excellent commentary on NMF. I particularly agree (as does Bergen) with his statement that, when you have the two alternatives of showing either 3-card support or 4 cards in the other major, you should prefer showing your 3-card support. 

Most teachers teach you should prefer the 4-4 fit to the 5-3 fit but, if the two best bidding theorists both say you should prefer showing 3-card support, you should listen to them.

Having said that, I recommend that you should consider playing checkback Stayman rather than NMF. It is a much better convention. Checkback works as follows. If, over a 1NT rebid, responder bids 2@C, that is asking about opener's majors. As with NMF, opener shows either 3-card support or the other 4-card major. If he has neither, he bids 2@D (similar to the way regular Stayman works over a 1NT opener). 

Checkback has the advantage of providing much more flexiblity for responder, especially after a 2@D response. He can pass with a weak hand and long diamonds (similar to garbage Stayman), bid 2NT to show an invitational hand, or bid 2@H or 2@S to play.

If you want to get even more sophisticated, I suggest you consider playing 2-way checkback (sometimes called 2-way NMF). It works as follows. Over a 1NT rebid, a 2@C rebid by responder is checkback but only shows an invitational hand. A 2@D rebid is a game force.

It asks about opener's majors but is also used to explore for slam in any suit (including the minors). I have written a tutorial (put link here). However, if you really want to learn the full power of 2-way checkback, I suggest you look at Marty Bergen's audio lesson which will give you a taste of the Bergen material.

mb|2H|NT||lb|*yWe do not agree with this call. Do you?^^n|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I think East has a clear 3@H opener at the very least. In fact, given he is at favorable vulnerability (his side is not vulnerable and their side is vulnerable) and his hand has a "magical void" (as Bergen likes to say), 4@H would be a reasonable opener.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@H is much too conservative and, not only will make it easier for the opponents to compete, but it will mislead partner as to the tremendous playing strength of that hand.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bergen uses the acronym ^*B"WARIB"^*N when discussing favorable vulnerability. That stands for "White Against Red Isn't Bridge". "White" is bridge slang for "not vulnerable" and "red" is bridge slang for "vulnerable". |
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The terms come from the colors used to show vulnerability on old fashioned duplicate boards. If you were vulnerable, the color of the slots for your cards were (and usually still are) red. If you were not vulnerable, the color was white (these days boards are multiple colors so the slots are just not red rather than specifically white). |
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|What Bergen means by "Isn't Bridge" is that you should be particularly aggressive with preempts when you are at favorable vulnerability and make bids that you should not even consider at any other time. There is a great deal of upside to doing so and very little downside. |
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even if you are doubled and down several, you are likely to get a better score than if you let the opponents scientifically find their best spot. And the opponents know that doubling you often will not yield them a good score and will therefore tend to bid one more, often to their detriment.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Some might consider 3@D with the South hand, but I agree with pass in direct seat. An extremely important factor in determining whether or not to bid over a preempt is the number of cards you have in the opponent's suit. You should strain to compete with a singleton or void. A doubleton is a mediocre holding meaning you should only compete with a solid opener. |
PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A 3-card holding is the worst holding you could have. ^*BBTW, a 3-card holding is the worst holding you can have any time the opponents bid that suit.^*N And South is also at unfavorable vulnerability. Those 2 factors (heart length and unfavorable vulnerability) make it unwise to compete despite the nice 6-card diamond suit.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In balancing seat (e.g. after 2 passes), it is less clear what to do holding that hand. I probably would reluctantly bid 3@D, although I would be worried. Why would I be worried? Given the heart length, partner is more likely to be short in hearts. And he chose not to compete. |
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As I mentioned above, in competitive auctions, the shorter you are in the opponent's suit, the more you should strain to compete. So it is quite possible that either he is not short in hearts or that he has a weak hand. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well played and I agree with the bidding. Because of the lucky diamond position 3NT happens to make but it could easily go down. Although I don't mind being in 2NT, for the following reasons I favor being in 3NT.|
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In general I do feel, in IMPs, that more often than not if you are in 2N you might as well be in 3. Because the reward for making 3NT is much higher than the risk you can make exactly 2NT. Going down 1 extra trick does not matter much in IMPs. But the game bonus in IMPs is worth a lot.|
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So I tend to bid 3N over 2N most of the time in IMPs. But not in Match Points where a) the game bonus is not worth nearly as much and b) the undertrick can make a big difference. Much of the time you bid the same in both Match Points and IMPs. But the 2NT invitational bid is one area where I feel your bidding should be different depending on the form of |CP|1|FP|2|AT|^*Hhttp://www.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=scoring,scoring^*N|CP||FP||at|.|

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|A hand from a semi-final in the British Gold Cup some years ago.|
PG| ***** 156 ***** |


NT|^B@2
At one table there was little interest; South opened 2NT in fourth seat and North raised to game. The @SJ lead, covered by the @SK and @SA, gave declarer little chance of making any more than his ten top tricks and the cards were soon back in the board. North-South recorded +630 and everyone at this table soon forgot about the deal.|
PG| ***** 157 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However… at the other table North-South were losing the match badly and they bid to a sporting 6@H contract by South. West led the @SJ to the @SK and @SA and East returned a trump. Declarer won that cheaply and took his Spade ruff in the dummy with the @HQ. |
PG| ***** 158 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now South drew trumps, cashed the @CA K and played off the last two trumps. In the three card ending dummy was reduced to the @DA 9 and the @C10, declarer had the @DK 7 3 and East still had to make a discard from his remaining @DJ 10 4 and the @CQ. Whatever he did next was going to cost his side 1430 points and a large swing.|
PG| ***** 159 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West started to blame his partner for not returning a Diamond at trick two, thinking that it would break up the squeeze, but, in fact, 6@H can always be made except on an initial (and extremely unlikely) Diamond lead.|
PG| ***** 160 ***** |


NT|^B@2
How can South make 6@H on a Diamond switch at trick two? Ah! I will quote one of those old-fashioned maths textbooks, "That will be left as an exercise to the reader."|
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


NT|^B@2
This deal caused no stir at all in the Lords v Commons match. All four pairs found themselves in 3NT by South and it was all a question of overtricks. The Lords picked up 30 aggregate points by managing one more trick than anybody else. |

^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|This deal is once again about counting and planning to identify where your tricks are coming from. Success depends upon also being able to reach your tricks with limited access to one of the hands.|
