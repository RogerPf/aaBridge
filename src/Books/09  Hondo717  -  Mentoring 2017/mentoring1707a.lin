^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The line of play was correct. However, Declarer should first draw trumps. There is no hurry to run hearts. If the trump finesse wins, even if spades are 3-0, North can get back to the board with a club ruff and then run hearts. There is no reason to play hearts first.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Personally, after 4@S, I would have doubled with the West hand although it is far from clear. The double is NOT penalty per se. It is simply "cards" and asks partner to "do something intelligent." And with 3 pretty sure tricks it is likely that 4@S is going down. So the risk of doubling is not that high even if partner passes.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As it turns out, the best East/West can do is hold South to 4. West did fine to play the @HA. However, once East discouraged hearts (East would have encouraged hearts if East held the @HQ) then the only chance for the defense is if East holds the @DK and South holds 2 diamonds.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Once East discouraged the @HA, West should shift to the @DA. So East is correct in that West should switch to a diamond  after @HA. Unfortunately since I have a singleton it only saves one trick and I make the contract. In general, leading away from the @DAQ is dangerous. However, once a few tricks are played, then it becomes clearer to lead diamonds|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, 5@D contract by East/West, would end up being a better score than 4@S making. Thy lose 2 hearts, and 2 clubs for down 2. But it would not get doubled. So -200 would be a better score instead of -420 or -450. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East  definitely should not bid 5@D over 4@S. East is vul and has a flat hand. 5@D could easily be down 2 or 3 doubled. So pass by East is clear. However, once West reopens with a double then I think East should bid 5@D|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am not sure what I would have done with that hand. I strongly prefer having 4 cards in the unbid major so double is slightly off shape. But with the strong hand, I think double is very reasonable.|

NT|^B@2
Doubling with a 5-card major is sometimes a problem, but with a 5-card minor, not so much. Certainly if West had 4 hearts and 3 clubs rather than 3 hearts and 4 clubs, double would be clear.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@S is the right contract. 4@S requires both black suit finesses to work and a 3-2 spade break. Also, note the power of distributional hands. East West have only 21 HCP. Not only that but the @DK and @HQ are basically worthless. Despite that, 4@S had plays.|
PG| ***** 107 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You need to strongly upgrade distributional hands. East's hand is somewhat better than it looks. The 5-5 distribution is wonderful. Unfortunately the @DK and @HQ are not worth much and result in a downgrade. Had either of those cards been in one of the black suits, the hand would have been even better.|
PG| ***** 108 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if you consider the total Bergen Points, the fact that in this auction the @DK is not really worth 2, the 8-card fit (as opposed to a 9-card fit), and the fact that partner only bid 2@S--6-9 I think 3@S is the best bid.|
PG| ***** 109 ***** |

yes, on this hand 4@S happens to make luckily, but it is probably about a 15% contract and I don't want to be in 15% contracts.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Very nice bid by East. West passed quickly. To me it is unclear whether or not to bid 4S. All pard might need is 3 spades for a 9 or 10 card fit. So vul at IMPs I might bid 4@S although pass is certainly very reasonable.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East has 5 spade tricks, 2 hearts and 1 diamond for 8 tricks.  East needs a diamond ruff for the 9th trick. So East needs to play diamonds before drawing any trump. You should draw trump ASAP. But often you have to delay drawing trump. This hand illustrates the most common reason that you delay drawing trump--you want to ruff something in the hand with short trump.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Partner has led the @D2, indicating four diamonds headed by an honor. A quick count of the diamond distribution suggests that there are two diamonds to be cashed. The @SK could be a trick as well but we can hardly lead the suit. Thoughts?|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|You don't need to be afraid of leading back a low diamond.|
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Partner led the @D2 which promised an honor, and given that you are looking at them all (except the @DJ), partner must be in possession of it.|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Besides, declarer rose with the king which confirmed that analysis. Who would rise with the king when holding the jack in his hand when the opening leader would almost never have underlead an ace?|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Partner may have an entry in hearts or clubs (in fact, you hope so since you need it to defeat the contract) but by relinquishing control in either suit would be too late to set up a spade (since declarer can then rise with the @SA and go about drawing trumps).|

NT|^B@2
Well, it is the only rational defense when faced with that dummy!|
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Even if we somehow had the clubs covered, there is no rush to lead one since declarer's clubs aren't exactly running anyway. ^*BIt is rarely right to lead dummy's long suit.^*N|

NT||up|20|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, declarer blew the hand at trick one. Declarer knew that you had to have the @DA (since underleading aces occurs very seldom) and should play low from dummy at trick one to prevent you from putting partner in for a possibly disastrous spade switch.|
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
1. Aces are seldom underled at trick one against suit contracts. Therefore, if the king is played from dummy in the suit that has been led, it is a pretty safe to assume that declarer does not have the jack. |
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


NT|^B@2
2. Ask yourself how many tricks your side needs in order to defeat the contract. Consequently, ask yourself then what is the least number of honor(s) needed from partner to defeat the contract - then, play as if partner has those cards! |

What is it? Where are twelve tricks coming from?|

NT|^B@2
One chance of twelve tricks is to take the Spade finesse. This is only a 50% chance, however (a bit less for us unlucky players...).
 
Can you see an additional chance?|
