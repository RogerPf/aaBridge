^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There really wasn't much to this hand. The bidding was fine. However, as I did on the first trick, on every hand on defense, you should try and figure out what declarer has, both distribution and high cards.|
PG| ***** 16 ***** |


NT|^B@2
When there is a NT opening or rebid, that is often pretty easy because opener's HCP are known within a 3 point range and typically you have some idea about their distribution. So in particular HCP counting is fairly straight forward.|
PG| ***** 17 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You just take opener's range and and add in dummy's HCP. That gives you the range of HCP for the offense. In this case, as I said, I figured out they had 25-27 HCP. That means we have 13-15. I have 3. That means partner has 10-12.|
PG| ***** 18 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Similarly partner can make the same calculation. Partner had 11. That means South has 2-4 points. Again, that was not crucial information on this hand but it often can be. So get in the habit of trying to determine declarer's HCP when on defense.|

On the other hand, 3@H is fine although officially North has limit raise points because the @DK is dubious based on the 1@D opener. If the @DK were the @CK, then I would treat the hand as a limit raise and bid 2@S for sure. Many times you have to evaluate your hand and upgrade or downgrade based on the auction.|

NT|^B@2
It can't hurt, and often helps. Even if you don't have a real squeeze, you might have a "pseudo squeeze." That means the opponents might misdiscard even though they are not really squeezed. On this hand West had a real squeeze.|

PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Some do play that 2@S does show extra values but most modern 2 over 1 players do not play that. In fact, many 2 over 1 players play that North with 4 spades and 4 clubs would bid 2@C rather than 1@S with a game forcing hand. Certainly with 5 clubs and 4 spades and a game force hand North would bid 2@C.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So it is possible from South's perspective that their side has a spade fit which is why South should bid 2@S.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Remember that 2 over 1 includes the principle of "fast arrival" meaning once you establish a game force which the 2@C bid did the faster you bid game the weaker you are. If North had, for example, 16 HCP and 3-card support he would bid 3@H rather than 4@H at his next turn.|

Even if that loses the the @SQ I will get back to the board with the @CA and play another spade, hoping East has at least 1 spade honor.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I would plan all this out at trick 1. For those who watch me play with my friends  you will notice I take a lot of time at trick 1 and then usually play the hand pretty quickly.  That is a good habit to get into. Make your plan at trick 1 and then execute it.|

And even then, you will make far more mistakes on defense than on any other part of bridge which is one reason why it pays to be an aggressive bidder. Even if you get to a hopeless contract sometimes a misdefense will let you make.|

Even if it doesn't clubs might be 3-3. If the club finesse works and clubs are 4-2 I have 9 tricks (4 clubs 3 spades and 2 diamonds). |
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That is how I am going to play the hand although it doesn't work on this hand because of the very unlikely 5-1 break-- less than 10%.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@D is a very reasonable tactical bid. The other alternative would be to make a negative double to show hearts and then bid 3@D later. But 3@D puts more pressure on the opponents.|

West: Double with @HJ1084?|
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|J108x of hearts is fine. Even if partner has as little as K9xx or even Qxxx its not a bad trump suit. But I still like 3@D better. In diamonds you have a likely 9 card diamond fit and only an 8-card heart fit at best.|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


NT|^B@2
3@D is weak as if West had a limit raise in diamonds, the bid would be 2@S.|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I have an interesting issue. I have 15 Declarer Points after discounting the @DQ. 9 HCP (not counting the DQ), 2 length points, one quality suit, two for singleton, and one for 4-card side suit.|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Partner is under pressure and might a) only have 3 spades and b) might only have 8 points or so. On the other hand, partner could have 10 points. With 10 points and 4 spades, partner might bid 4@S.|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So, although I think 4@S might make and I would not fault someone who bid it, with my weak spades I am passing 3@S.|mb|p|
pg| ***** 136 ***** |


at| However, if vul, playing IMPs, I would bid 4@S. Because you should stretch to bid vul games in IMPs.|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But non-vul, or playing Match Points, I pass 3@S. As you can see, the 3@D bid made it very hard for North/South to bid accurately which is why you must bid aggressively and preempt when you can.|

Therefore, if East ducks the @HA I am going to pitch my losing heart on the @DK. If East counts out my hand and, with lots of hard thinking should figure out to take the @HA.|

PG| ***** 164 ***** |


NT|^B@2
With E/W having roughly 25 pts and us holding 10, that doesn't leave much for partner. 4-5 pts maybe? We see two Spade tricks, and possibly our well-placed @CK. Now, the dummy. |
PG| ***** 165 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It really doesn't cry out as a trump or dump dummy. We probably should go passive and await further developments. What should we do at trick 2? Continuing Spades is not an option, as that would enable declarer to use dummy to trump Spades.|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|The dummy is DEAD. Declarer can't trump or dump. We need to go passive. We don't want to break a new suit, and we don't want to continue Spades, since (if declarer has three) that would turn dummy from dead into a trump dummy. |
PG| ***** 181 ***** |


NT|^B@2
When we are passive, we either lead trumps (not the most desirable in this case because of dummy's finessable holding) or give them a trick that is theirs in any case. We elect at trick 2 to lead a Diamond. |
PG| ***** 182 ***** |


NT|^B@2
And this ends up to be the best strategy. Ultimately, declarer has to lead a Club to try for the finesse. It doesn't work, and we end up garnering four tricks: Dummy's winning Diamond, our @SA K and our @CK.|
PG| ***** 183 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There are some flaws in the analysis. First, North should signal with the @DQ on the first diamond trick. This specifically shows the 2DJ and often the @D10. Second, declarer can make the hand because of the fortunate club position. |
PG| ***** 184 ***** |


NT|^B@2
After winning the diamond, lead a club from dummy and take the losing finesse. Back comes a diamond. Win the diamond and play a club to the ace. Lead a heart to the @H10 and ruff a club high (with the @HK). Lead a heart to the ace and play the @C10, throwing a losing spade or diamond.|

You need to pick up the trump suit without losing a trick. You also need to score four Diamond tricks. Of course the cards will need to lie favorably. Even so, you will have to play well to take advantage of this. Think carefully as you play this trick.|

NT|^B@2
If we win with the @CK in our hand, there would be no way to enter dummy to take one of the finesses we need. We therefore overtake with the @cA. |
PG| ***** 216 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The best chance of picking up the Spades is to lead a low card, hoping that East holds a doubleton @SK. If we mistakenly lead the @SQ, East would cover with the @SK. We could win with the @SA and play the @SJ, but would then lose the third round of the suit. |
PG| ***** 217 ***** |


NT|^B@2
We finesse the @SJ successfully, cash the @SA and return to dummy with the @SQ. We then lead the @DQ and pick up four Diamond tricks for the contract. |

ht|f|AT|^c@2^z^^^^"Today's selection -- from The Klondike Fever by Pierre Berton. In the late 1800s, the sparsely populated mining camps of Alaska and the Yukon River valley of Canada were the end of the earth. "Fortymile" was one such camp:|
PG| ***** 221 ***** |


ht|j|AT|^c@2^z^^"Who were these men who had chosen to wall themselves off from the madding crowd in a village of logs deep in the sub­-Arctic wilderness? On the face of it, they were men chasing the will-o'-the-wisp of fortune -- chasing it with an intensity and a singleness of purpose that had brought them to the ends of the earth. But the evidence suggests the opposite. They seemed more like men pursued than men pursuing, and if they sought anything, it was the right to be left alone.|
PG| ***** 222 ***** |


ht|p|at|^c@2^z^^"Father William Judge, a Jesuit missionary in Alaska, described them as 'men running away from civilization as it advanced westward -- until now they have no farther to go and so have to stop.' One of them, he discovered, had been born in the United States, but had never seen a railroad: he had kept moving ahead of the rails until he reached the banks of the Yukon. They were Civil War veterans and Indian-fighters, remittance men from England and prospectors from the far west. 


Many of them had known each other before in the Black Hills, or the Coeur d'Alene country of Idaho, or in the camps of Colorado. They were nomads all, stirred by an uncontrollable wanderlust, which seized them at the slightest whisper of a new strike, however preposterous. They were men whose natures craved the widest possible freedom of action; yet each was disciplined by a code of comradeship whose unwritten rules were strict as any law.|

^-|CP||FP||at|^^^b@2"Fortymile, in short, was a community of hermits whose one common bond was their mutual isolation. 'I feel so long dead and buried that I cannot think a short visit home, as if from the grave, would be of much use,' wrote William Bompas, a Church of England bishop who found him-self in Fortymile. ...|

"They were all individuals, as their nicknames (far commoner than formal names) indicated: Salt Water Jack, Big Dick, Squaw Cameron, Jimmy the Pirate, Buckskin Miller, Pete the Pig. Ec­centricities of character were the rule rather than the exception. There was one, known as the Old Maiden, who carried fifty pounds of ancient newspapers about with him wherever he went, for, he said, 'they're handy to refer to when you get into an argument.' There was another called Cannibal Ike because of his habit of hacking off great slabs of moose meat with his knife and stuffing them into his mouth raw. One cabin had walls as thin as matchwood because its owner kept chopping away at the logs to feed his fire; he said he did it to let in the light. Another contained three partners and a tame moose which was treated as a house pet. Out in the river lay Liar's Island, where a group of exiles whiled away the long winters telling tales of great ingenuity and implausibility.|

"By the peculiar etiquette of the mining camp, a man who bought a drink bought for everyone in sight, though such a round might cost a hundred dollars; while a teetotaler who refused a drink offered a deadly insult -- unless he accepted a fifty-cent cigar in its place. Hootch, like everything else, was paid for in gold dust, and the prospector who flung his poke upon the bar always performed the elaborate gesture of turning his back while the amount was weighed out, since to watch this ritual was to impugn the honesty of the bartender.|

"Fortymile thrived on such unwritten laws, its residents enjoying a curious mixture of communism and anarchy. It had no mayor or council, no judges or lawyers, no police or jail or written code. Yet it was a cohesive community. No man went hungry, though many were destitute. Credit at Harper and McQuesten's store was unlimited. If a man had no money, he could still get an outfit without payment. There were few 'bad men' in Forty­mile; on the contrary, it was a community that hewed surprisingly closely to the Christian ethic. Men shared their good fortune with their comrades, and it was part of the code that he who struck a new creek spread the news to one and all. Each man's cabin was open to any passer-by; such a traveler could enter, eat his fill, sleep in the absent owner's bed, and go on his way, as long as he cleaned up and left a supply of fresh kindling. This was more than mere courtesy in a land where a freezing man's life might depend on the speed with which he could light a fire."|
