^-|at|
^C^*BI. Scheme played by Howard (it is independent of whether or not you play RKCs or regular Blackwood).
|ht|n|at|^c@2^Y@3^*Ba) Do not show the void if you feel your hand is weaker than partner has a right to expect--no ace.
b) With an odd number of key cards, you bid 6 of your void suit. If your void suit is higher than the trump suit (e.g. you have a spade void and hearts are trump), you bid 6 of the trump suit (otherwise you would have to bid 7).
c) With an even number of Keycards, you bid 5N.|
ht|t|at|^cII. Another scheme is for those who play standard Blackwood.|
ht|u|at|^c@2With no aces (don't show the void), respond 5@C. 
With one ace and a void
^Da) Jump to the six level in the void suit if it is lower ranking than the trump suit
^Db) Jump to the six level in the trump suit if the void suit is higher ranking than the trump suit
^CWith two aces and a void, bid 5NT.^*N|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now the question is, should Gail bid 2@H? What does that show? And this brings up another issue in 2/1 which you need to discuss with partner. 2@H definitely shows a 4-card heart suit and is a reverse. But does it show extra values (like a reverse in SAYC and some who play 2/1) or is Gail simply showing her shape? Most people these days (including me) play that 2@H does not show extras, it simply shows 4 hearts.|

sk|W|NT||lb|*mWhich suit should West lead from?^Clubs~Diamonds~Hearts~Spades^4|pc|D4|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally I would lead a diamond with Ed's hand. I believe in 4th from longest and strongest, with longest taking priority. So with no one bidding diamonds, I would lead a diamond. However, once Gail bids diamonds, it is likely she has diamonds. On the other hand, we did not bid spades. So I would have led a spade with Ed's hand. In general, I try to avoid leading a suit the opponents have bid unless all other choices are worse. In this case, a spade seems like a reasonable alternative.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Lets count tricks. With that lead, I have 3 diamonds 2 hearts 1 club and the spade I took. I need 2 more tricks. I have to hope that I can get them in the club suit. Or that whoever I throw in with a club doesn't have a spade and has to give me a heart finesse.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I do normally advocate 2nd hand low. But that only applies when the first card to a trick is a low card. In this case Babs has a clear cover of the @CQ with the @CK. I cannot get to the board again, so she sets up a sure trick with the @C10 if she does cover. It is complicated as to whether to cover an honor with an honor as second hand, because sometimes it is wrong. But in this case, Babs has a clear cover as she knows she is setting up her @C10.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general I would avoid leading a diamond since Ed bid them. But with @DQ J 10 it is a reasonable lead. However, if you never lead a suit the opponents bid, you will come out ahead. And as it turns out, if Gail had chosen to lead a club, that works ok as well. But a diamond was perfectly reasonable and would have been chosen by most experts.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although he made it, a slightly better line was to ruff a diamond at trick 3 as he did. Then throw his 4th diamond on the @SK as he did and now play a club. Planning on losing 1 club and 2 hearts, because he can ruff the 3rd club in dummy. Instead he lost 2 clubs and 1 heart, but there are so many heart positions where he loses 2 hearts and 2 clubs the way he played it.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When bidding a 3-card minor over forcing NT, some people bid their better minor. That is what I do. But other people, when 3-3 in the minors always bid 2@C. However, I bid 2@D with my hand and others would bid 2@C. I prefer bidding a suit you have cards in, to allow partner to know when to bid NT. So I recommend against bidding 2@C any time you are 3-3.

A Kib:  Why did he bid 1N, When he can support your suit?|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Interesting question. First, 3@S assuming you play that is a limit raise promises 4 cards in spades. With 3-card support and 10-12, you delay "support with support" for 1 round. You bid something else first.|
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In SAYC "something else" is 2 of a minor and in 2/1 "something else" is forcing 1NT. Then bid 3 of opener's suit the next round. So in SAYC an example auction is 1@S-P-2@C-P-2@D-P-3@S. In 2/1 an example auction is 1@S-P-1N-P-2@D-P-3@S.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With 2-card support and 10-12 you do not raise unless opener shows a 6-card suit. So in 2/1, if opener has a 5-card suit, an example auction is 1@S-P-1N-P-2@D-P-2N; if opener has a 6-card suit an example auction is 1@S-P-1N-P-2@S-P-3@S. |

PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT|^B@2
bizarro: Looking at my hand, with so many quacks, maybe I should have downgraded and just bid 2@S right off.
|
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But most people would bid it the way you did. However, let's do pure Bergen counting and see what we come up with. You have 11 HCP, -1 for Jx of hearts, -1 for 5 quacks and no aces or tens, and +1 for doubleton heart. So you have exactly 10 dummy points. You have a border line but reasonable 3 card limit raise.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First the bidding. You all notice they only have 24 HCP between them, yet they made 6 and would even make 7 if the spade finesse worked. Though, I hate to sound like a broken record, that is why HCP are only a small part of evaluating how good your hand is. |
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if you want to do one thing to improve your bridge, go over my slam lessons 1 and 2 on Bergen hand evaluation and learn it well. It will improve your bidding immensely.|
PG| ***** 96 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I had a bunch of questions on how to respond to RKCB with a void. I can summarize it quickly. First of all, you should only show your void if it is "useful." That generally means that you should not show a void in a suit that partner has bid, because that is a detriment, not an asset. |
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let's assume partner bids RKCB and you have a useful void and also, you think you have enough key cards where slam is sure to make. Then if you have an even ## of key cards (2 or 4, probably not 0) you bid 5N as Gail did here. |
PG| ***** 98 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you have an odd ## of key cards (1 or 3), you bid 6 of your void. (1 key card assuming it was enough to guarantee slam.) So with 1-3 key cards Gail would have bid 6@H. That assumes of course your void is in a suit lower than the trump suit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On another hand, lets assume the trump suit were hearts and Gail had 3 key cards with a spade void. She would not want to bid 6@S as that takes them right past 6@H. In that case she would bid 6@H over 4N, showing 1 or 3 key cards and a void in a suit higher than hearts (obviously spades in this example).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As most of you know, I strongly advocate opening 1NT even with a 5-card major as do most experts. There is no good way to show 15-17 when you open 1 of a major, and the only time it is even a problem is when partner has exactly 3-card support.|mb|1N|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Ed has 9 HCP and can count 1 point for the doubleton ending with 10 dummy points which normally would be enough for 4@H. But once again, he has a hand with lots of quacks, so he subtracts 1 for the 4 quacks and no aces or tens. So with 9 Dummy Points he can invite.|mb|3H|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Babs chose the lead I would have chosen. Generally speaking it is good against suits, if you have no honor sequences, to lead a suit with nothing in it. And you should prefer a longer suit to a shorter suit because that is less likely to give away a trick. The idea is, declarer's finesses are working anyway in that suit, so you are less likely to be giving something away. Babs 2 choices were spades and diamonds, and diamonds are slightly better because they are longer.|pc|D3|

^B@2^*BMM: ^*NHold everything. Gail knows better how to play the spades here. What really happened is Howard was answering several private chat and told Gail to lead to @SK which she did. Of course I could use my movie making magic and make amend. But I did not want several great teaching points go unnoticed. So I decied not to change anything and Howard will give a worthy explanation after the play. There is more to it. Just wait.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I take all the blame for this. This is the disadvantage of playing random hands and answering private chats from the Kibitzers. I took my eyes off the ball. Obviously, you can make the hand by dropping the singleton HK offside (if you want to amuse yourself, look up the "rabbi's rule" in bridge). But that is the incorrect play, as the singleton king is offside only a small percentage of the time.|
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The correct play is to take the heart finesse as Gail did. However, the mistake I made was I told her to lead to the @SK to get to the board. That ended up blocking the spade suit. The correct way to play the hand is to lead a low spade to the @SJ at trick 3 (don't play the SA first). Then take the heart finesse. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When it loses, you can still run 4 spade tricks. After drawing trump, you play the @SA and then the @SQ and overtake with the @SK which allows you to take 4 spade tricks.|
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you play it that way, because a trick 5 gave declarer a ruff sluff (rather than cashing the CA as the setting trick), the hand can now be made. Gail ruffs the 4th diamond high in dummy and throws a club from her hand. She now draws 2 more round of trump, plays the SA, plays the SQ and overtakes with the SK, and throws the CK on the good 4th spade.|

^-{    Beginner Intermediate Lounge     }
^-|fp||ht|c|at|^b@2Maureen Hall (hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

- Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players.
- Where beginner and intermediate players could get to meet and practice together. 
-Where those serious about improving could  have one-on-one lessons with a Mentor 

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily,- Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Team Matches, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite and more.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lesson and  help notes became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. 

Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

In 2013 , in order to offer more opportunities for study, the BIL now operates from two sites.  
1. the BILies Retreat in the BBO Public Clubs, where the open teaching and practice sessions and specials event are held. A place for members to bring their non BIL friends.  
2. The LearnBrdge Classroom in the BBO Private Club section where level restricted, pre-registered, topic specific Courses are held

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
