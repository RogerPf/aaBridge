Leading Partner's Suit Against A Suit Contract  
^-|fp||cp||at|^B@2Every bridge player has heard the, "Lead partner's suit unless you have a good reason not to." Let us assume partner opens or overcalls a suit, but eventually your RHO becomes the declarer in a suit contract, and you are on lead. Let us look at what are the standard choices for a good opening lead.

If you have not supported the partner
^CLead low from three or more small cards.

If you have supported partner (showing at least 3-card support)
^CLow if you have one honor
^CHigh if you do not have an honor

Whether you have or have not supported the partner   
^CTop of touching cards.
^CTop of a doubleton (whether or not you have an honor)
^CHigh from an honor sequence of 2 or more adjacent honors--10 is considered an honor. 
^CIf you choose to lead partner's suit holding an Ace, lead the Ace.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That was a squeeze that should not work if the defenders can figure out how to discard correctly, but they often can't as on this hand. Theoretically Babs should protect hearts and Gail should protect clubs but it is not always so easy to work that out.|

A kib: I have a question about the opening bid - please explain how that hand qualifies.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you just use simple rule of 20, it does qualify with 11 HCP and 9 cards in hearts and clubs. But if you use Bergen hand evaluation, then Kia's "adjusted HCP" are only 10 because he deducts 1 for the @DQJ. I admit I probably would have opened it as Kia did (my excuse would be my nice club intermediates, lol) but theoretically he probably should pass.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is the rule I use about doubles and major suit holdings. In general, I strongly prefer to bid a 5-card major to making a takeout double (even if opener has bid a minor and I am 5-4 in the majors). So by that theory, Gail should bid 1@S with her hand.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, she could decide she wanted to double and correct with her strong hand. I think her spade suit is slightly too weak to double and correct, but she is also slightly too strong to bid 1@S. Therefore, she just has to decide which white lie she prefers as neither bid is perfect. On this hand, other than the fact that she now won't declare, she wins the jackpot-:).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now I am sure one of the kibs will give me the exact odds, but a 2-1 break in clubs is very likely (in excess of 80% I am pretty sure). However, I can guard against a 3-0 club break if I guess who has the 3 clubs. By now Kia has already shown up with 3 spades and 5+ hearts, and 3 diamonds. So if anyone has 3 clubs, it would be Babs.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|If you count the hand out, the way to play clubs is very clear. My only other comment is a slight suggestion on Babs defense. After cashing 2 diamonds, she should play a heart. If Kia only has a 5 card suit, it is very likely they have 2 heart tricks. And it is also possible I will pitch a losing heart on a diamond or club.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So she should play a heart to make sure their side gets all the hearts they are entitled to. As it turns out it made no difference but it might have.|

^-{    Beginner Intermediate Lounge     }
^-|fp||ht|c|at|^b@2Maureen Hall (hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

- Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players.
- Where beginner and intermediate players could get to meet and practice together. 
-Where those serious about improving could  have one-on-one lessons with a Mentor 

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily,- Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Team Matches, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite and more.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lesson and  help notes became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. 

Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

In 2013 , in order to offer more opportunities for study, the BIL now operates from two sites.  
1. the BILies Retreat in the BBO Public Clubs, where the open teaching and practice sessions and specials event are held. A place for members to bring their non BIL friends.  
2. The LearnBrdge Classroom in the BBO Private Club section where level restricted, pre-registered, topic specific Courses are held

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|1|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |

hondo717: ok last hand
 
 
hondo717: ok, now I know gail has length in clubs, probably a 5-card suit
hondo717: how do I know that?
 
hondo717: well it takes some detective work, but based on the bidding an expert would work it out
 

hondo717: since I have 4 hearts, she probably has no more than a singleton, based on the auction where the opponents have indicated an 8 card heart fit
 
hondo717: she does not have 4 spades, because she would have bid 2 spades
hondo717: if she had 6 clubs, she might very well have bid 3C
hondo717: so, it is very likely her distribution is 3-1-4-5
hondo717: this is the kind of thinking experts do all the time.
 
hondo717: you can often glean a lot of information from the bidding. less experienced players dont always realize that

hondo717: there are both positive and negative inferences
 
hondo717: positive inferences are things you can work out based on what was bid
hondo717: in this case, the positive inference I have is that the bidding indicates an 8-card heart fit
hondo717: negative infereneces are somewhat harder, and are conclusions you can draw based on what was NOT bid
  
hondo717: there is a famous Sherlock Holmes story where Holmes says "Well the conclusion was obvious Watson because the dog did NOT bark"
hondo717: that is a negative inference
BabsG:  Hound of the Baskervilles?
hondo717: I thought so, but someone I think told me no
 
hondo717: anyway, how does that apply to bridge?
hondo717: well I have several negative inferences from gail's pass
hondo717: a) she does not have 4 spades for sure
hondo717: b) she probably does not have 6 clubs
hondo717: so thats how I can work out her hand
BabsG:  (I think he means me not Gail)
hondo717: and confidently bid 3C
hondo717: sorry, you keep switching on me, lol
hondo717: yes I meant babs
