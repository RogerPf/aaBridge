^-|CP|8|AT|^b@2^Y@3^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|At least as of a few years ago, the most common method for bidding after a takeout double was as follows:

1) New suits at the 1 level are forcing and unlimited (same as if there were no takeout double).
2) New suits at the 2 level and above are weak, and show less than 10 points. (This principle is not understood by many less experienced  players.)
3) 2 level raises in the majors typically show 6-9 with 3-card support; 3 level raises show 4-card support and less than a limit raise.
4) 2 level raises in the minors typically show 6-9 with 4-card support; 3 level raises show 5-card support and less than a limit raise.
5) 2NT is Jordan 2NT, showing 4+-card support and at least limit raise strength (both in the majors and minors).
6) Redouble shows 10+ points and denies 4+ card support.

^*BI think there is a simpler way to play, and that is what I use. With 10+ points, you redouble with less than 4-card support and bid Jordan 2NT with 4+ card support. Any other bid denies 10 points and is not forcing (including new suit bids)^*N.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us discuss the hand first. Don's best bid is probably 1N rather than double. 1N in 4th seat shows 11-14 and a stopper in opener's suit. In direct seat (had you been east) then you need 15-18. Don has the perfect 1N balancing bid. So if Liz bid 1N that would have shown 15-18.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Next is the defense. We should have beaten that hand by 2. For starter Jenny should duck the first diamond. Aces should be used whenever possible to cover an opponent's honor. By taking the @DA immediately she set up 2 diamond tricks for declarer. Had she ducked, declarer only gets 1 diamond trick.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Second, at trick seven, she though I might have a doubleton diamond, and I might have. However, before playing a third diamond she should play a spade. Further, at trick 9, when she was in with the @HK she definitely should play a spade. "It is  never wrong to take the setting trick."|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In the old days, with 5-5 in clubs and spades, you opened 1@C. The idea being it would go 1@C-P-1x-P-1@S-P-something-p-2@S. But these days you should open 1@S with 5-5 usually. So normally I would open 1@S with this type of hands. On the other hand, particularly since partner passed and we may not end up declaring, there is a case to be made for 1@C.  I have a strong hand and prefer a club lead and my spades are so bad that I could treat them as a 4 card suit.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But after all is said and done, laying claim to spades is often a good idea on a competitive hand because partner passed, I know the points are pretty even between the 2 sides. Not to mention I am making harder for Don to compete. Further, since the first 2 players passed 4th seat will often have a good hand.|mb|1S|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For lead we will play "coded 10s and 9s" on this hand. If you play that, my lead of the @H10 shows either no cards higher than the 10 (very unlikely on this auction) or a broken sequence with the J (AJ109 or KJ109) - 0 or 2 higher. When partner sees dummy, he knows I have KJ10 (since dummy has the ace).|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not playing coded 10s and 9s, you would lead the J from J109, KJ10, and AJ10. Experts feel it is important for the partner of the leader to know whether, on the lead of the J, the leader holds a higher honor besides the jack. So they came up with the idea that the lead of the jack denies a higher honor. (They sometimes call this "jack denies".) So, with a holding of KJ10 and AJ10 you have to lead the 10. |
pg| ***** 52 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is usually easy for the partner of the leader to figure out whether the leader has the jack and a higher honor or is just leading 10 from top of nothing. If it is top of nothing, the jack is often visible in or the A and K are both visible.  So with the lead of the 10, the other defender can usually figure out when partner has KJ10 or AJ10.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But this led to another problem. The standard lead (not playing coded 9s) from A109, K109, and Q109 is the 10. Well, now the 10 is used to show AJ10 or KJ10. So they had to change the lead from A109, K109, and  Q109 to the 9. But if you are an expert, the "jack denies a higher honor" inference is very important.|

NT||lb|*yShould South play the heart King?^^y|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now the question is, should I cash the @HK. if Liz started with 3 hearts (possible but unlikely) then I will beat the hand. Since the 5 is missing as well as the @HQ, my partner could have the 5 remaining since he led back the 7. But if partner does not have the 5, I am setting up a heart tricks. |
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is unlikely partner has any more hearts, because if he did, he might very well have made the LOTT bid of 3@H. But then I need to decide if we need a heart trick to beat the hand because although it is possible I will get in with a spade, it is not likely. So basically it is now or never to cash my heart. I think at the table I would because I would feel really stupid if I had a lot of heart tricks.|pc|HK|

I do understand that many teachers feel that it is wrong to lead away from tenaces (like AQ or KJ) on opening lead in NT for fear of giving away a trick. I do not agree with them. It is true that on occasion, you will give away declarer's 9th trick. But more often a) you will set up your suit (as on this hand) or b) you will give away a trick with whatever other suit you lead.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good try Liz. I really liked the fact that you appreciated your hand was worth much more than its 10 HCP. I much prefer over enthusiastic bidding to conservative bidding :). And yes I would have bid 4 if you invited. But then it would be my fault :).|

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.|
