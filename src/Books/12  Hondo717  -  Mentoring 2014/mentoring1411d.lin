^-|CP||va|4|AT|^b@2^*B30^*N. One doesn't lead the same against 3NT as against 6NT. Against 6NT avoid leading from an honor unless you have a sequence.|VA|4|at|
^C@2With: @S K107(6)3 @H (J)108 @D 85 @C Q92 Lead the @S6 against 3NT, but the @HJ against 6NT. (If they have about 33 HCP, guess how many partner has!).

^b@2^*B31^*n. At notrump it is important to keep communications with partner's hand. If partner's lead looks like top of a doubleton, it's usually a good idea not to take the first trick. Let partner keep that second card so when he gets in he can return your suit.|VA|4|at|
^C@2This tip comes in very handy when you have A-K-x-x-x-(x) with no outside entry. If you duck the first trick, partner will be able to return the suit when he gets in.

^b@2^*B32^*n. When declarer ignores a strong suit in dummy lacking one honor, assume declarer has the honor. If he doesn't, that would be the first suit he would be leading - the rule of 'Unattended Strong Suits'.|VA|4|at|
^C@2If you see something like the K-Q-J-10-(x) or A-Q-J-10-(x) in dummy and declarer plays other suits, assume declarer has the missing honor.

^b@2^*B33^*n. When there is a short side suit in dummy and declarer draws all of dummy's trumps, the inference is that declarer doesn't have any losers in that suit to ruff. |VA|4|at|
^C@2Translation: It is safe to discard that suit.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is alerted as takeout. However, it really is not takeout. there is only 1 suit remaining and you can't make a takeout double with just 1 suit remaining. What East can do is bid 2@S if she wishes. Since you did not bid 1@S over 1@H, you are showing 4 spades, not 5, and 5+ clubs. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I always like when students are aggressive. So I am not too critical of Marny's bidding. She has a nice hand with good distribution. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally it would be good to be aggressive. However, you do need to listen to the auction. Because this auction indicates we have a misfit hand.
There are several clues:|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|
^Ca) I showed spades and Marny has 4 spades
^Cb) I did not raise hearts immediately and Anna did not rebid 2@H. |
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So Anna probably has 5 hearts and I probably have 2 hearts. That means Kia probably has 5 hearts. Kia did not raise 2@C to 3@C meaning it is unlikely their side has even an 8 card fit and Kia might even have a singleton club.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So for all those reasons I would have passed 2@H. I would have not been happy to waste such a good hand on defense, but the auction would have told me that is the best thing to do.|

BT||NT|
First of all, remember Kia's 4N bid. It is a useful tool and does come up when the the opponent raises 1 of a major to 4 of a major. It is "unusual" in the sense that it shows the minors. But, depending on the auction, it may not show 5-5. In this auction, where kia opened 1@C and then bid 4N,|CS|6|HT|d|va|5|at|{|ia|,,Pp1C1SX4S4N|at|}|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


HT|d|AT|^L@2he does not need 5 diamonds, but he does need 5+ clubs.
|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


AT|However, if the auction goes, for example,
|HT|f|at|{|ia|,1HP4H4N|at|}|HT|k|AT|^L@2That would show a strong hand with at least 5-5 in the minors.
@0|
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


HT|m|AT|If on the other hand the auction goes,
|ht|n|at|{|ia|,1sp4s4n|at|}|ht|n|at|^L@2that has a special meaning. It says that Kia is at least 5-5 in 2 of the 3 remaining suits. Either clubs/diamonds, clubs/hearts or diamonds/hearts. This auction is an exception to the minor suit rule. Otherwise, always, 4N in a competitive auction is for the minors.
@0
|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


ht|r|at|In the last auction, specifically, responder has to make sure their side plays in one of partner's 5 card suits. So they make an appropriate bid to make sure they get to their best fit. With nice clubs, they can always bid 5@C. if partner pulls to 5@D, showing diamonds and hearts, then they pass or correct to 5@H. If responder bids 5@D, then they must have tolerance for hearts and no tolerance for clubs. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The answer is, because I had a singleton club so I wanted to retain the lead. I did not want to lead my singleton club because Kia could easily have running clubs on this auction and our spade trick might go away. |
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But if I saw Kia lacked the club ace, and decided that we did not have 2 spade tricks (I know from our 10 card spade fit we only have 1 spade trick at best). Then I would lead a club at trick 2 and hope partner has the @CA and can give me a ruff.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


LC|c8|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out, in 4@S, we are down 1, which is a the best E/W can do. But looking just at the E/W hands, 5@D is a great contract. It takes a 4/1 club break to beat it, and that assumes we find the club ruff.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So yes, 4@S down 1 is the theoretical best score for E/W but looking at just the E/W cards all experts would prefer to play in 5@D. |
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But the main point on my bidding is, don't be afraid to use the LOTT and bid 4 with a 10-card fit even at unfavorable vulnerability. More good things will happen than bad things most of the time. 10 card fits are very powerful.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The double is unnecessary and is giving opponents more advantage than necessary. Let me explain. First, If on lead I would lead a heart because you already bid 1@H. |
PG| ***** 122 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You can claim that you are showing a better heart suit but that is not helpful. Now let us see how East is going to use your double to their advantage.|
pg| ***** 123 ***** |


mb|2S|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now as you know East, after a redirecting double of a transfer has two choices which he would not have without double - pass and redouble.|
PG| ***** 124 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had the bidding gone 1@H-1N-P-2@H(transfer)-P, East had to bid 2@S whether he had 2 or 3 card spades and West would not know. However, after the double East can pass the 2@H transfer doubled with 2-card spade or bid 2@S with 3-card spades. as he did here.|sk||

^B@2^*BMM: We regret we could not capture all the teaching part, particularly on the play of the hand, in this board as transcription is not one of our major attribute. However, a pass after a redirecting double shows 2-card support and a bid at the 2-level shows a 3-card support. But we received the following comments from Howard, how Board 5 was defended, while we were making this presentation.^*N|
PG| ***** 140 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North should not duck the SA. There are several reasons on this hand why the duck is wrong.|
PG| ***** 141 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First of all, since South led the @H9, North knows that South does not have the @HJ (he would have led low from Jxx and J from Jx) and has at most a doubleton (South leads count in partner's unsupported suit). So there is some chance of a heart ruff.|
PG| ***** 142 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, there are some defensive complications. East has both the @HJ and @H10 (based on the @H9 lead) and may be able to throw a diamond loser on the 3rd heart. So the defense needs to take their diamond tricks before giving up the lead. |
PG| ***** 143 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Therefore, North, after playing the @SA, should lead the @DA and see what South signals. If he signals high, indicating the king (which is what he will do on this hand), North should then lead a 2nd diamond. That is 3 tricks for the defense. North has to hope that South will lead a club to give him a ruff for down 1.|
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Note that if South had the @DK but also started with a singleton heart, he should signal with a low diamond even though he has the @DK. Then North will likely play a heart, and South would get his ruff and then could still cash the @DK.|
PG| ***** 145 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The point here is you should not duck an ace unless you have a good reason to. And on this hand, the defensive timing in fact says North should take her ace as soon as possible. |
PG| ***** 146 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This gives the defense several chances to beat the hand with potential diamond winners and heart and club ruffs. By ducking the ace, North gives up the chance for her side to get some ruffs and also gives declarer the chance to throw away a diamond on the third heart. So ducking the @SA will likely cost the defense at least one or two tricks.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is rule which applies in this bidding cycle which says you should show your 4-card support right away.|
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You have two major problem by bidding 2@H:
^C1. you denied having a 4-card support which is not true.
^C@22. Your 2@H bid is a reverse which you cannot make. You have enough points for a reverse but you do  not have a 5-4 distribution which is critical for bidding a reverse.|
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


NT||lb|*bWhat should be the bid by East?^^4S|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You simply can bid 4@S which shows 19-20 points and 4-card support and no singleton or void. Now your partner knows the exact nature of your hand.|
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Further, the 4@S is not a shutout bid. It simply says, "Partner I have 4-card support, 19-20 points and no singleton or void." With a singleton or void, opener would splinter rather than directly bid 4@S. So, for example, if it goes 1@C-P-1@S-P-? and opener has 20 points, 4 spades, and a singleton or void in diamonds, he would bid 4@D rather than 4@S. Therefore a direct 4@S bid over 1@S denies any singletons or voids.|ub||

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This was a good board to bid grand slam. But first let me discuss an important comment on play - tricks six and seven. At tricks six and seven, on the @HK and @HQ declarer should throw 2 clubs, not a diamond and a club. Then there is no need to take the club finesse.|
PG| ***** 174 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My philosophy is you should not bid grand slam unless you have better than 70% chance of making it. Here it turns out that because of the way the 2 hands fit, the 7@S grand slam is a very good contract. However, my philosophy is to never bid a grand slam unless I can pretty much count 13 tricks. |
PG| ***** 175 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The reason is that you will score well just for bidding a small slam. So if you bid a grand slam that goes down, you turned a good result into a very bad result. It is not worth the risk.|
PG| ***** 176 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Mathematically, it turns out you should not bid a grand slam that has less than about a 70% chance of making. That means that bidding a grand slam that simply depends on a 3-2 break (68%) is somewhat iffy. |
PG| ***** 177 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|From a practical perspective, it is almost always impossible to calculate whether or not you have a 70+% chance of making 7.. So my practical rule is I never bid 7 unless I can count 13 sure tricks. |
PG| ***** 178 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, there was no way for West to know that their side has 13 tricks, so 6S is the best bid.|

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
