^-|CP||ht|l|AT|^c@2^Y@3^*BAfter an opponent's preempt things can get rather sticky. Once you are forced to guess, even the world's best players sometimes will not get to their best contract. However, knowing what to do after an enemy preempt does not need to be a blind guess. The key is to be able to answer the age old critical question "to bid or not to bid?".

How can you know the answer? It is a combination of exercising good judgment and relying on some important principles. That is what this lesson is all about.

Your RHO opens 2@H and you have this @S A 6 @H 7 6 @D A K Q 8 6 5 @C A K 2 hand. What is the expert bid here? 

There are expert bids that you are capable of making. Most experts would cue bid 3@H. We don't use Michaels cue bids when the opponents open a weak 2-bid in a major. We find it is more useful to cue bid to show a terrific hand with a long strong minor but without a stopper in their suit. We are begging partner to bid 3NT with a stopper. If partner does not have a stopper, he does the best he can.

Why would you do anything but 3N? There are occasionally hands where 5@D might make and 3N does not. But there are many more hands where 3N makes and 5@D does not. And there is no good way of telling when 3N is not making.|mb|3N|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Well the good news is spades are 4-4 so I can afford to lose a trick. I know that because Babs led the 3 (presumably 4th best) and Todd led back the 2. Hence Babs must have 4 spades, since the 3 was her lowest spade. Additionally, Todd is leading back his remaining count, and the 2 shows 3 remaining spades, which means he started with 4. Again, if you are careful you can glean a lot of info from the cards that are played.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So let's see. With a normal diamond break I can get 5 diamonds, 1 spade, 2 clubs and 1 heart for 8 tricks. And I can knock out the @HK for 9 tricks. Also, if diamonds break 4-1 and Babs has Jxxx I can pick up the suit if I play the @DA first.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


pc|C6|sk||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Of course, because diamonds are 5-0, it turns out it would have been better to cash the @DK first and finesse Babs twice. But 5-0 breaks are extremely rare. I am sure Babs will look up the percentage for me--3.9%. That qualifies as "very rare".|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Good teamwork on the discarding by Todd and Babs. If they were less careful, I might have gotten an extra club trick but Todd chose to save clubs, and Babs correctly saved spades. Nice job.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is important when a declarer is running his tricks. One defender needs to let the other defender know which suit they want their partner to save. They do that by discarding the suit they want their partner to save. So in this case Todd discarded spades, which told Babs to keep spades.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Okay Gail, lets think about this for a second. Do you think Babs has the @CA? I might have 3 clubs if Babs only had 6, but it is more likely I started with 2 clubs. Now, if Babs had the @CA and played a low club rather than cashing the CA, you should congratulate her on making a really nice play. But it is much more likely that I have the singleton club ace left. So, as usual, 2nd hand low is right. The point is, you need to think about what declarer would play if she had the @CA and @CK.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So on the defense Gail should be worried about Babs pitching her losers on the hearts. Therefore, she should win the @SA and play another diamond, hoping I have the K and was unable to signal. It is unlikely Babs has the @DK. She already showed up with the @SK and club points. If she had the @DK also, she would have close to an opening hand. Generally, the bidding and the play give you clues as to what to do.|

BabsG:  ?  Howard - do you find that weak 2@D is more valuable than a convention bid like Mini-Roman?|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I like a weak 2@D because it comes up much more often. But mini-roman, when it comes up, can work well. The problem is it only comes up like 2% of the time, whereas you get to open a weak 2@D much more often. I believe, in general, you should gear your bidding to the hand types that come up more frequently.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The best example of a convention based on frequency is the negative double. Yes, every once in a while you would like to have the penalty double available after an overcall. But the negative double comes up so much more frequently that it is much better to give up rare penalty doubles in favor of frequent negative doubles.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So that is what you should do in general. Play those conventions that help you with the common hands. Don't worry about the esoteric hands. They rarely come up. If you bid the common hands correctly, you will do much better than most people.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First of all Gail had a very reasonable 3@D bid. Given Babs bid 1N, Gail had every right to expect Babs had a diamond or two. Not to mention that she got a very bad diamond break even with Babs void. Most of the time, the suit will divide 4-3 and Gail will still take 5 diamond tricks.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As far as the rest of the auction, over 1@H what should Babs do? This hand screams misfit and pass is the correct bid. Anyhow, once Babs bids 1N, Todd made a nice 2@S bid. Normally I play new suits by responder to an overcaller (the official term for that is "the advancer") are forcing. However, over 1NT that is not the case. |
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, take the auction 1@C-1N-2@H. The 2@H is to play, not forcing. That is a rare case where a new suit by responder is not forcing. If the 2@H bidder had a good hand, they should double. The auction 1@D-1@H-1N-2@S is similar. If Todd had a good hand he could double. So new suits after a NT overcall or natural bid are not forcing. they are to play. But in general new suits by responder and advancer (responder to overcaller) are forcing.|

^-{    Beginner Intermediate Lounge     }
^-|fp||ht|c|at|^b@2Maureen Hall (hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

- Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players.
- Where beginner and intermediate players could get to meet and practice together. 
-Where those serious about improving could  have one-on-one lessons with a Mentor 

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily,- Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Team Matches, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite and more.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lesson and  help notes became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. 

Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

In 2013 , in order to offer more opportunities for study, the BIL now operates from two sites.  
1. the BILies Retreat in the BBO Public Clubs, where the open teaching and practice sessions and specials event are held. A place for members to bring their non BIL friends.  
2. The LearnBrdge Classroom in the BBO Private Club section where level restricted, pre-registered, topic specific Courses are held

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature. 

Now please, click|CP|1|at|^*GR1, here^*N|CP||AT| to return to your original location. |
