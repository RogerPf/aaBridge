Howard has no problem with using such bidding concept, however, his style has been teaching what is more often than not.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Granted, if I had not guided the defense. N/S probably make 3@S. Let me explain why I think south should not bid 3@S. There are some pretty good competitive guidelines you should follow, if you believe in the Law of Total Tricks as I do. And those guidelines, as related to competing to the 3 level are as follows. First of all, let's talk about deciding when to bid "3 over 3" as on this hand (e.g. deciding whether nor not to bid 3@S over 3@C).|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, you should only bid 3 over 3 in one of the 2 following instances:
^c1) you have a 9 card fit or
^C2) you have a singleton or void in the opponent's suit.|
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Neither of those instances was true in this case for South. Generally bidding 3 over 3 is not a good idea particularly in IMPs. In match points the decision is a bit more complicated, because if your side can make 3@S that might be a better score than beating 3@C. In general, your only goal in IMPs on a part score hand is to go plus.|
PG| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It depends on how the defense goes, but my guess is 3@C is going down. E/W have 4 losers for sure, 2 clubs, 1 spade, and 1 diamond and they could easily lose another trick somewhere. But even if they make 3@C, that is basically the same as beating 3@S.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss a bidding technique known as "picture" bidding. On some distributional hands, when deciding whether to bid game or slam, you try and "picture" what partner needs in order to make. This is one of those hands. Sally has first round control of all suits other than diamonds. And because of their system she knows they have at least a 9-card diamond fit.|
PG| ***** 42 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at| So, if partner has 2 diamond honors and that is it, 6 is likely to make. If Sally just wanted to bid 6@D I think that would be reasonable. It would be more likely they are missing 7 than not making 6.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss a couple of other things. I got some questions about whether north should make a negative double. The answer is absolutely not. You always try to make the bid that best describes your hand. A negative double, although often useful, is a pretty ambiguous bid. It defines neither the number of HCP (other than more than 6 or so) nor the number of hearts (other than 4 or more). |
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@H is a much more descriptive bid. It says "partner I have 10+ points and 5+ hearts." When you have a choice of bids, always make the most descriptive bid you can. For example, you should always open 1NT or overcall 1NT if that is an option because those are very descriptive bids. The more descriptive you are, the more likely you are to bid accurately.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The final thought on this hand is the opening lead. Although it doesn't happen to work on this hand, I think a spade is pretty clear cut - @S6, 4th best, assuming that is what they play it. I assume Katy led a heart was because she was hoping partner would be ruffing. The reason it is not as likely to work is that would mean that N/S have 8 hearts between them and given the auction, that is not likely (although it is not completely out of the question).|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I was asked what was the double by South. I assume it was penalty. What else would it be? But not sure, given the vul, double is a good idea, but I would assume that's what it meant.|

PG| ***** 48 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I do  not think so. However, there is a lot of confusion over support doubles, so let me explain when they apply.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The times when a double is a support double are very well defined. Basically, a support double only applies when the following occur:
^Ca) you open
^Cb) partner bids 1 of a major
^Cc) the next person doubles or overcalls (or raises their partner).|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding is such that if responder (the one who bid the major) has to rebid their suit, it can be at the 2-level. That means if the intervening bid is higher than 2 of the major, support doubles no longer apply.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The more common example is 1C-P-1H-1S-dbl where the double is a support double. The intervening bid is below 2@H and partner only promised 4 cards in hearts. Support doubles only apply if partner is only guaranteeing a 4 card suit. That means the auction 1@D-1@H-1@S (promises 5)-2@H-double is not a support double because 1S promises 5. However the auction 1@C-1@D-1@S-2@D-dbl is a support double, because 1@S only promises 4 in that auction. |
PG| ***** 52 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The purpose of a support double is to show 3-card support when partner might only have a 4-card suit.Once partner shows 5+ support doubles no longer apply.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First of all, should Mark bid? It's not clear. But in general, letting the opps play 1NT without interfering will not get you a good result. The best you can hope for is an average result most of the time. So your tendency should be to bid. Let's assume Mark plays DONT. I think they play Meckwell, which is similar.|
PG| ***** 70 ***** |


NT|^B@2
obsugar:  Kate and I play Brozel. In Meckwell, I would just bid spades. Kate and I agree a single suit must be 6 and we double for it.|
PG| ***** 71 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That's fine. But you have a nice 5-card suit and a nice hand, sitting behind the 1N bidder and your cards are favorably placed. I think if I were not vul, I would make whatever bid allows me to show my spade suit. 2@S if playing DONT or Meckwell, and double (I believe) playing Brozel and tell partner I "owe" him a spade.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, vul, down 2 is worse than letting them make 1NT. Therefore, I think I would pass as Mark did since he does not have a 6-card suit, and might even be beating 1N. Nevertheless, the main point is you should strain to compete when you can.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to what Mark should lead after cashing spades. He was right not to cash the @DA and he was right to lead a suit with a queen hoping it would set up a trick for their side. But, if he watched the discards, I think a heart would have been better than a club. North discarded one small club, and two hearts - @H5 and @H10.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|
Granted, North could have had the AKJ105 of hearts. But it is more likely, with the CJ on the board, and the discard, that a heart will work out better than a club. Far from obvious, but these subtle inferences are what improves your play, especially on defense.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Remember the purpose of 2 over 1 is to allow you to go slowly when you are in the slam range. 3 of your major means the following:

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Marilyn why did you bid 1@S. I think your choices are pass or 2@S. you are not strong enough for 1@S|

wyllow: even if short clubs, still consider Sally's club a suit?|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But some experts would claim that is natural just so you know. but I agree with Kate :) because more often than not it really is clubs.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is true. He should have some values  or at least long hearts. One inference you have is he did not bid 3@H so he probably doesn't have 4 hearts. Or if he does, his hand isn't that good.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|but I think 3@H by West is reasonable.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding was fine here. I am not sure N/S make 3 of a minor but it is close. Kate has a nice enough hand that after Mark's 2@H free bid, 3@H is reasonable. Not sure I would bid 2@H with Mark's hand, but once he does, I think Kate has enough to bid 3H.|
