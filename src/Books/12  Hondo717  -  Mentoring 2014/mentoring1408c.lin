^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Don does not have a takeout double. A takeout double means 2 things:
^ca) you have an opener (or close to it) and 
^cb)you must have at least 3 cards in all the unbid suits.|
PG| ***** 19 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When you make a takeout double in particular, partner will strain to bid a major. So you should have 4 cards in the 1 unbid major almost all the time, or be at least 4-3 if there are 2 unbid majors. Sometimes, particularly when they open your long suit, you have to pass even with an opening hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's discuss the opening lead. Given Jenny decided to lead a spade rather than a club which is reasonable, given her nice spades. The best lead from a 3-card sequence or broken sequence is the top of the sequence. Typical sequences are KQJ or KQ10, QJ10 or QJ9, and J109 or J108.|
PG| ***** 39 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|From all those sequence the correct lead is the top of the sequence. Jenny's lead should have been the @SK. BTW, the lead of the K asks partner to give attitude, so with any honor, partner should play a high card. So West should play the S6 (low) on the @SK.|
PG| ***** 40 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the play, the best play is the @DA first. Take the @CA, take the @CK and @HK. Then the @D10 and dummy is good. No need to take the club finesse. Always count your tricks. Also you have to unblock the clubs and hearts|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Most people would pass with Jenny's hand, and given this vulnerability that is probably best. However, I do like the Bergen "OBAR" approach. |
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|OBAR means "Opponents Bid And Raise" which is what happened on this hand. Bergen's theory is, especially when you are short in the opponents suit, you should "pre-balance". |
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is, if you make a bid, you are not showing strength particularly, just making a) a lead directing bid if you bid a suit and b) forcing them up. So if Liz had chosen to bid 3@D, that would not be strong, just show nice diamonds.|
PG| ***** 45 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Doubles in OBAR are still takeout but do not have to show a particularly strong hand, just shortness in the opps suit and 3+-card support in the other suits.|
PG| ***** 46 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As an OBAR bid, 2N by Liz would be a minor suit takeout double not a strong NT. The theory being that once both of us bid, showing 20 points or so at least, the odds of east having a strong NT are small. And even if East did have a strong NT her partner would not have much. That's how OBAR works. On this hand, given the unfavorable vul, and pretty nice spades, pass is probably best by Jenny.|
PG| ***** 47 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now lets look at my hand. Whenever you are 6-4 your hand is much better than its point count. Let me count my Bergen declarer points and see if I have any excuse to try for game.|
PG| ***** 48 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|13 HCP, -1 for dubious @DQ, + 2 length points, +1 for the 6th spade once we find a fit, +1 for the side 4-card heart suit, and +2 points for the singleton gets me to 18.If partner has 8 or so, I want to be in game.|
PG| ***** 49 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another thing that many experts play is sometimes called "1-2-3-stop". That means if you play it, is that 3@S by me is not an invite. It simply says that you are expecting the opponents to bid over 2@S and are going to bid 3@S if they do. So you bid 3@S right away as a method of shutting out the opponents bidding.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Had I had fewer points but 6 spades, meaning LOTT says I can bid 3@S with my 9-card fit, and we were playing 1-2-3 stop, I would bid 3@S. |
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, on this hand, I bid 3@H which is an invitational bid asking Liz to value heart cards and bid 4@S with nice hearts or just a good 8 or 9. 3@H does not promise 4 hearts, just some points in hearts.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And when that loses to the @SA, I have a choice of finessing the @SJ or playing for the 2-2 break. Had Don bid, showing a long suit, I would finesse. But just like with the "8 ever 9 never rule" regarding the trump Q on this hand, playing for the 2-2 spade break is slightly (but only very slightly) better|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|He has 11 HCP plus 1 quality suit point combined with his 8 cards in the majors he just meets the rule of 20. Therefore, 1H would be a reasonable bid as well as pass.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also, in 3rd seat, you should strain to preempt. Had my 6-card suit been anything but clubs, I would have opened a weak 2. But being vul, only having a 6-card suit, and having flat distribution (no singletons or voids) I decided pass was better. |

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|But if you wanted to open 3@C 3rd seat, it could easily work out pretty well. We are down 1 at most, taking 6 clubs and 2 aces, and we might steal another trick somewhere. |

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Jenny should really bid 2N over 2@H. That would get us to 3N which makes even on a heart lead so long as Jenny ducks at least 1 round of hearts. After, Don can never get in to run his hearts. |
PG| ***** 112 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And Liz is out of hearts after the 2nd round. We take 5 clubs 1 heart, 1 or 2 spades, and 1 or 2 diamonds at least.|
PG| ***** 113 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bergen calls the 2N bid relying on playing "2 against 1". What he means by that is the preemptor is unlikely to have any high cards outside their suit. |
PG| ***** 114 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And the preemptors's partner is likely to be short in partner's suit. So by suitably ducking a round or 2 of the preempter's suit basically the preempter's hand is dead, and declarer need only worry about the partner. Hence "2 against 1".|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Remember, whenever you have the opportunity to open or overcall a natural NT, you should do so. It is a very descriptive bid and results in more accurate bidding by your side.|

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
