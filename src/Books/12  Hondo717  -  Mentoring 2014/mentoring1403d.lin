^-|CP||AT|^c@2^Y@3^*B"Constructive Raise" and "Single Raise" are just a terminology issue, and the terminology is not universally understood.

The simplest terminology is to think of 1@H-P-2@H as a "Single Raise." I play it shows 6-9 (occasionally 5) with exactly 3-card support. That means if you bid a forcing 1NT over 1 of a major, you cannot have 3-card support.

Another way to play, which I do not like, is that a single raise is a bit stronger, say 8-10 or even 8-11. If you play that, then the single raise is called a "Constructive Raise." With 3-card support and 6-7 you first bid a forcing NT and then correct to 2 of opener's major.

I don't like playing that a single raise is "constructive" (e.g. 8-11), because a) opener cannot tell whether or not you have 3-card support and b) if you raise immediately it takes up more bidding room and makes it more difficult for the opponents. As usual "support with support" whenever you can.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|the bidding was good on this hand. Despite Kia's nice hand, he is pretty sure they have 2 spade losers so no point in trying for slam. As I said, the only thing worth discussing on the play is what Babs and Kia should do once we cash 2 spades.|
PG| ***** 53 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Given the auction where Kia showed 5+ diamonds, a diamond is not likely to help our side and might in fact help Kia. As it turns out, Kia should play the @D9 on the @D8. that way regardless of who has the DJ he is guaranteed to not lose a diamond. Babs should have probably just led back a heart, not a diamond, and Kia should have played the @D9 or 10 not low. The 2 plays cancelled each other out. most people will be making 4.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One other interesting thing about this hand is that 3N happens to make, because of the very lucky spade position. If you look at the spots carefully, you will see Babs has to cash the @SAK. even if I throw the SJ and S10, I have the S6 left, so the suit blocks. We can only take 4 spade tricks unfortunately. But 4@H is the correct contract in any case.|

You never do well letting them play in 2 of their suit when they have established an 8+ card fit. So Bergen recommends OBAR bids, or what he calls "pre balancing." Most people will not bid with my hand unless they have a good hand. But Bergen feels "If you have something to say, say it."|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You could make a case for either pass or 4@S. In IMPs I prefer 4@S. in Match Points I prefer 3N. But lots of times it won't make any difference. If you always raise with 3, I think you will be right more often than not, especially at IMPs. On this hand, absent a diamond lead you make 4 spades 3 hearts 2 clubs and a diamond for 10 tricks, so you make the same ## of NT as spades.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And actually if they shift to a diamond after winning the spade, Kia  has to worry. Some people feel with 4-3-3-3 distribution and not 4-card support you should always play 3N. But my feeling is that 4@S is usually safer. Therefore, in IMPs you should bid 4 of the major. Occasionally partner will have a hand that wants to play in slam if there is a fit, but in 3N if there is not. So in IMPs I always bid 4@S if I have 3-card support. But in Match Points, it is more complicated because often you make the same ## of tricks in NT and spades and making 4N in match points is a better score than making 4@S.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, sometimes you do make more tricks in spades, especially if you have an iffy stopper in 1 suit. After all is said and done, if you always bid 4@S with 3-card support you will often be right. But if you want to pass in Match Points with 4-3-3-3, that is ok too.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I need to answer a question regarding whether I play 1NT forcing if it is bid by partner who originally passed. The simple answer is YES.|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I personally play 1NT is forcing by a passed hand. And if you don't play Drury, where 2@C by a passed hand shows a 3-card limit raise, then I think you should definitely play 1N forcing because otherwise, partner might pass you when you have a 3-card limit raise.|
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Personally, I prefer playing forcing NT even if you play Drury because that gives responder more flexibility to play in their long suits. But many people feel that 1N should be "semi forcing" or not forcing at all by a passed hand.|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Not forcing is self explanatory. But semi forcing means that with 12-14 and 5-3-3-2 distribution, opener passes. So if opener bids a new suit over 1N, that almost always promises a 4-card suit when playing semi-forcing. However, I like to keep it simple and play 1N forcing even by a passed hand.|
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have tried semi-forcing and did not think it was advantageous. One of the few areas where Marty Bergen (who plays semi forcing even by an unpassed hand) and I disagree.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|With unlimited entries to dummy, a better way to play the spade suit, missing just the KJ, but holding the Q 10 9 8 is to take 2 finesses through East, hoping East has at least one honor. So if I could easily get to dummy I lead the @S9 and play low if Gail plays low.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On this hand, Babs wins the @SK and I now only lose one spade. If on another hand, Babs won the @SJ, I would go to dummy a 2nd time if I could and lead the @SQ and hope Gail had the King.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So with lots of entries to dummy, the right way to play the spades is to take finesses through East. But because I had limited entries, I played the @SA and a low spade. If West hesitates, I would assume West has the K. On the other hand if West plays low smoothly I play the @S10.|

^-{    Beginner Intermediate Lounge     }
^-|fp||ht|c|at|^b@2Maureen Hall (hallway on BBO) wanted somewhere on BBO :

- Where teachers could give lessons without interference from Advanced players.
- Where beginner and intermediate players could get to meet and practice together. 
-Where those serious about improving could  have one-on-one lessons with a Mentor 

Maureen asked BBO for a Private Club to be called the Beginner Intermediate Lounge and so the BIL began on September 3, 2003.

With the dedicated help of a great team of Volunteers, Teachers & Mentors the BIL provides learning opportunities for the membership daily,- Open Teaching Sessions, Tournaments, Team Matches, Beginner Courses, One on One Mentoring, visits from the Bridge Elite and more.

In 2005 having a Library for storing all the lesson and  help notes became a priority and work began on developing a suitable web site. A major project--the BIL Library--was opened in Aug 2007. 

Today members have access to it 24/7. The archives grow daily and an important feature of the Library is the growing section of Bridge Movies which with their interactive features are an outstanding way to study the game.

In 2013 , in order to offer more opportunities for study, the BIL now operates from two sites.  
1. the BILies Retreat in the BBO Public Clubs, where the open teaching and practice sessions and specials event are held. A place for members to bring their non BIL friends.  
2. The LearnBrdge Classroom in the BBO Private Club section where level restricted, pre-registered, topic specific Courses are held

^-{ Double Dummy Play Instruction }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.
