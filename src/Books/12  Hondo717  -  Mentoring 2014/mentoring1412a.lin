^-|CP||va|4|AT|^b@2^*B38^*N. The best time to lead a short suit is with trump control. 
^C@2A-x-(x) or K-x-x are great trump holdings to lead from shortness. However, if ruffing will cost you a trump trick, leads from shortness with trump holdings such as J-10-x-x, Q-J-9-x or K-Q-9-x are counter productive.

^b@2^*B39^*N. When signaling encouragement with equal spot cards, signal with the higher or highest equal.
^C@2With A-9-8-7, signal encouragement with the 9 (which denies the 10). If you lazily signal with the 8, you are denying the 9! Some partners actually watch stuff like that.

^b@2^*B40^*N. When giving partner a ruff, the card you lead is suit preference telling partner which suit to return after the ruff.
^C@2The return of a relatively high spot card asks for a return in the higher ranking of the two remaining suits. 
^C@2A return of your lowest card asks for a return in the lower ranking of the two remaining suits. 
^C@2The return of a middle card is designed to drive partner crazy. It actually means you have no preference.

^b@2^*B41^*N. Before playing to the first trick, review the bidding and make sure you remember the opening lead.
^C@2Sometimes the opening lead is a small spot card and it is important to know exactly how small. If the opening leader later plays another small card in that suit, you really want to know whether it is a higher or lower card than the original lead. You really do!

^b@2^*B42^*N. If one (or both) of your opponents is a passed hand, assume that player has fewer than 12 HCP. If that player turns up with 10 HCP early on, play the partner for any missing queen, king, or ace.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I probably would not overcall with this hand in any case, particularly at this vulnerability, but I would be much more tempted to overcall over 1@S than 1@H. Any time you are short in their suit, you should want to compete. If you have exactly 3 cards in their suit, that is the worst holding you can have.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us look at the worst possible bid for East - 2N. A 1@H-P-1@S-P-1N promises 12-14 reasonably balanced hand - the lack of a diamond stopper should not stop you from bidding 1NT if you had 12-14 balanced. A jump to 2N in that bidding cycle should be with 18-19 HCP and balanced hand. The lack of diamond stopper also is not relevant here.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East did not open 1N so she does not have 15-17. East does not have 6 hearts or 4 spades. Therefore, 2@C seems to be the best option available.|mb|2C|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me discuss what I know about clubs. Between Faye and Kia, they originally started with 4 clubs. 
hondo717: Kia cannot have a doubleton, because the 4 was obviously his lowest card, since I see the 3 and the 2. So Kia either started with 9xx or a singleton. If he started with 9xx I think we play that he leads top of nothing. So all the information leads to Kia started with a singleton.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even with the very bad break, only down 2. The 2 important points on this hand:
a) the rare jump rebid of 3@S which shows a good 6-card suit and 11 ish points. It is not forcing but highly invitational
and b) how a good defender can work out the club suit at trick 1.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The important point to b) is not this specific hand, but in general you should be counting out suits. There are many deductions you can make on defense based on the cards that are played. |
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On defense, think of yourself as a "bridge detective", Sherlock Holmes if you will. Drawing conclusions from the evidence presented. Many of the clues come from what is played and not played. But some of the clues (and this is what a lot of players forget) come from the bidding. |
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|For example, on this hand I know Faye has at least 6 spades from the bidding. And I worked out at trick 1 that she had 3 clubs. So I know she has at most 4 cards in hearts and diamonds. I also know she does not have 3 hearts because she never raised hearts. |
PG| ***** 61 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a famous "negative inference", a conclusion you can draw by what was NOT bid. Just like the famous "dog that did not bark" clue in Sherlock Holmes. If you think of yourself as a bridge detective, and try to gather clues, it is amazing what you can figure out.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As Kia's 2@S bid. Another alternative, which many would have chosen, is a negative double. That is certainly not wrong. However, 2@S also has something to be said for it for the following reasons.|
PG| ***** 115 ***** |


NT||NT|^B@2
a) It is possible, as Kia mentioned, that there is a club slam and this makes it easier to get there
b) Kia's hearts are very weak and Faye almost certainly has no more than 4 hearts.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|When partner opens 1 of a minor, they virtually never have more than 4 in a major. Rarely they are 5-6 but you need not worry about that. You should assume, for the purposes of bidding that partner has no more than 4 of a major after opening 1@C or 1@D.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So unless Faye has pretty good hearts, it is quite possible that even with a 4 card heart suit, you have 2 or maybe even 3 trump losers. Anyway, although I would not quarrel with a negative double, I think 2@S is also a very good bid.|

CP||fp||at|
^C@2^z@3When you play "double dummy," you see all four hands - it's great for practice play!  Click the card you want to play from the hand on lead and then from the other hands. You are unable to play the cards out of sequence.

After four cards have been played to the trick, click the center of the trick to ‘take it.' Now, you may lead the next card - from the hand who won the trick of course. You may always review the last trick taken by placing your cursor over the trick.

In some instances, you will see the opening lead has been made. You may use the back arrow in BBO or the ^*Bundo button in the Viewer^*N to undo the lead. You may then click the card you prefer to lead.  In the middle of play, you may undo one trick to replay it or you may undo several tricks one after the other--use the undo button in the viewer and back arrow in BBO. You may undo all the tricks to start at the opening lead again.  

When you finish, if you wish to repeat your play of the board, click the middle and undo all your tricks. Please note:  When playing double dummy, if you click the forward arrow, it cancels the double dummy feature.

at|^-{ What's The Origin of Pizza? }
^-|
CP||fp||at|
^B@2The word pizza is Italian for pie, but how that word wound up in Italian boggles etymologists. |CP|1|AT|^*Hblog.dictionary.com/whats-the-origin-of-pizza/^*N|CP||AT|

It may have come from the Latin pix meaning "pitch" or Greek pitta, but others say that it originated in a Langobardic word bizzo meaning "bite."

Where did the dish itself emerge? The common belief is that Italians invented pizza, but a baked bread with toppings has many other precursors in other cuisines. Italy's version of the dish, especially from Naples, is the one we are most familiar with, though pissaladière from Provence, coca from Catalan, and lahma bi ajeen from the Middle East all bear a remarkable resemblance to pizza.

Supposedly, this archetypal pizza, an open-faced pie slathered in tomato sauce and mozzarella, was ushered in by the baker Raffaele Esposito in Naples. In 1889, he made a patriotic pie topped with mozzarella, basil, and tomatoes, ingredients the colors of the Italian flag, in honor of King Umberto and Queen Margherita's visit. It is rumored the Queen enjoyed the pie, and thus, it became known as a Margherita.

In the US, Italian immigrants sold pizza in their stores, and the first pizzeria was opened in 1905 by Gennaro Lombardi at 53 1/3 Spring Street in New York City, but pizza did not truly not catch on stateside until World War II. Stationed in Italy, many American and European soldiers tasted pizza, and brought an appetite for this now-ubiquitous dish home with them.
