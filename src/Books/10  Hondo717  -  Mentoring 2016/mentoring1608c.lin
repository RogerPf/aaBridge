^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|A double of 4@C and higher by me is known as a "value showing" double. It has no specific meaning in terms of points or distribution. It simply means I have some values and it is "our" hand. Partner is supposed to "do something intelligent." Without shortness in the opps suit he should definitely pass. |
PG| ***** 1 ***** |

With shortness and a nice long suit of his own he can bid that suit (or if, for example, he was 5/5 he could bid 5@C), but often he will pass.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding was fine. Pass is probably North's best choice.
As it turns out we have an 8 card heart fit, but with the 4-1 break we lose 2 hearts, in addition to a spade and a club. So pass worked out much better than bidding 5@D or 5@H.|
PG| ***** 20 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It is rarely 100% clear what to do when the opponents preempt at the 4-level. You will often get it wrong, as even do experts, but if you use basic bidding principles of defending when balanced and bidding when unbalanced, you will improve your odds.|
PG| ***** 21 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
With a singleton spade, it would not be completely unreasonable for North to bid, but he is still fairly balanced, has a weak hand given he opened, and his diamond suit is not that great. However, there will be deals where it turns out 5@D would have been a better bid (but fortunately not on this hand).|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|^B@2
eliana:  I would be scared to pass with just one spade.|
pg| ***** 23 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|eliana makes a good point. Passing with a singleton in their suit is questionable, but because it is unlikely we can make anything, and if we can they are probably going down, I would choose to pass but I would also be worried.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|North is correct to pass but with a slightly different hand with same HCP (e.g. move his AK to the diamond suit) bidding would be right. Often it is not only how many HCP you have but where they are located that determines whether or not you should bid.|
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT|^B@2
High cards in your long suits are much more valuable than high cards in your short suits. And high cards in the opponents' suits are not nearly as valuable for declaring as high cards not in their suits.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now that spades have been raised, East has 14 Declarer Points. They are 9 HCP, 2 length points (1 for each black suit). East does not need to deduct for QJ doubleton of hearts because partner bid them. Then you can also add 2 points for the singleton and 1 points for the side 4+ card side suit.|SB|S|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |

I would bid 4@S, but if you wanted to bid only 3@S that would be conservative but not totally out of the question. However, pass is out of the question.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now before we start the play, let's talk about the 2@S bid by West. 2@S tends to show 4-card support but there are some hands where you can bid 2@S with 3-card support. If for example West had 4 diamonds and a singleton club, every expert would bid 2@S with the West hand. |
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, with flattish distribution bidding 2@S as opposed to 1NT is less clear. The fact that West has a small doubleton tends to favor 2@S,  but the flattish distribution tends to favor 1NT.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Personally I would bid 1NT, but I only slightly favor 1NT over 2@S. It is certainly a viable alternative.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Hard hand to play. East, (probably) has 2 spades and a heart loser. If the @SQ is onside the hand probably makes, although it is not clear how to play the hand. With the @SQ being off side regardless of how East chooses to play, 4@S is probably down 1.|
PG| ***** 50 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The 2 choices are to set up hearts or to try and ruff some clubs, but either way, likely to lose at least 2 spades, 1 heart, and 1 club.|
PG| ***** 51 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now notice if West had a singleton club, as I suggested, then 4@S has a lot more plays. Or if West had a 4th spade, the hand is also a lot easier to play. So although you should sometimes raise 1@S to 2@S (and do so more often than most players choose to) you do need to be cautious  since a) you might only have a 7 card fit and b) even with an 8 card fit a close game might not make.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That rule obviously did not work too well here -:) since North had 16 HCP and 1 trump. So I rest my case about arbitrary rules :). To me, fit is much more important than HCP. Personally I think the number of trump you have is much more important than HCP as this hand demonstrates.|
PG| ***** 74 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A 13 HCP hand with 3-card support is much better than a 16 HCP hand with a singleton trump. To me, the law of total tricks is the best thing to follow. Granted if North had a 2nd spade, I would bid 2NT with his hand, and bid 4@S if I showed a good weak 2, but with a singleton trump he should be happy to pass.|

qx||bt||ht|c|AT|^B@2^*BMovie Maker: ^*NSome of you may know, Kia must play face to face at the local club with his wife. He is, well a lame bridge player, at best and makes many errors at the table which infuriates his wife. So he receives a tongue lashing during the drive home which he keeps his total silence and then he is banished to spend a few nights with the porcupine family in the Canyon below their home in San Diego.

The porcupine family got so used to having Kia with them so often that they have a special room for him with a computer and an ultra-fast Wi-Fi. In fact, during the Howard's August 10 mentoring session Kia was playing while staying with the porcupine family.

The porcupine family has two boys 12 and 14 years old. Both have iPhone 6 and are wizards with the computers. They usually watch Kia when he is playing bridge, they did so on August 10. They know bridge better than he does and when the Rule of 17 was discussed during board 3 they were puzzled at all the commotion. 

The next day we received an email from the lads containing a report on Rule 17 which we bring you next. As it is accustomed in the porcupine culture the report is fair and balanced. Please take time and review the report and send your comments to Howard and not to the Movie Maker.|

Dear Movie Maker,

Kia was in a pickle last night for not bidding after Howard opened 2@S . The kibs filled the public chat area with questions about Rule of 17 and many also sent Kia instructions that he should ignore Howard and bid 4@S.

All of us felt sorry for him as we like him as our older uncle. He takes his stay with us in stride and spends nights with us after his wife kicks him out for bad plays at the bridge table. He endures all those hardship in silence, but we know he is suffering. It is not that pleasant to share a bed with two adolescent porcupines who toss and turn in bed all night moving their sharp quills around.

However, he really does not deserve all that admonition for not following the Rule of 17. The two of us did a Google search and called around and discussed the Rule of 17 with many internationally ranked bridge players. The consensus was that Rule of 17 is purely a  guideline--no more. Also, attached please see our report on the topic.

By the way, Kia is a nice human, but he is not cutout for this game you humans call Bridge. We told him to learn playing Ukulele as it is more fun and we all can go on the beach, play happy songs and watch funny lady humans in their skimpy beach-wares.

Best wishes
The Junior Porcupines AKA the LADS.|

PG| ***** 84 ***** |


at|^B@2

First of all, who can memorize all these rules? If you must know, the Rule of 17 is used when partner opens a weak two-bid. It's purpose is to tell you if you should look for game. It goes like this:|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


AT|

When partner opens 2@H or 2@S, add your HCP to your number of trumps (partner's suit). If the total is less than 17, there is no game. If the total is 17 or more, you can explore game. (If it is really high, you might just bid game or slam). |

NT|^B@2
Do I like this rule? Not really. It is a crude guideline which might have appeal to new players. But, as usual, I prefer thinking and judgment. What is partner's preempting style? Was he vulnerable?  Was he in second seat?  Consider the next hand.|

On the other hand, here is a "17" (really 17+1 - 18) where I wouldn't look for game.|
PG| ***** 97 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If partner dealt at favorable vulnerability and opened 2@S, I would pass and hope for the best. (I'd really like to make a takeout double, but they don't allow that). |
PG| ***** 98 ***** |


NT|^B@2
My partner's white on red 2@S is likely to look like the hand held by North-next.|
pg| ***** 99 ***** |


MD|0,0,SK J 8 7 6 2H8 5D6 2CK 8 2,0|
PG| ***** 100 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you put the two hands together, you'll be hoping you can make 2@S (and don't even think about notrump).|
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I haven't even mentioned IMPS versus Matchpoints. When Vulnerable at IMPs, you try harder to bid games. Form of scoring, position, vulnerability and partner's style all are factors.|
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
^*BSummary: The Rule of 17 is a guideline--no more.^*N I don't recommend that experienced players use it.|
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


NT|^B@2
*The way to look for game is to respond 2NT. This asks partner not only for a Feature,|CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.larryco.com/bridge-learning-center/detail/456^*N|CP||AT| but if he is minimum or maximum.|
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


NT|^B@2
He should show a Feature only with a maximum. If he is minimum, he should repeat his suit (and you will usually give up on game). If he is "medium" he must decide which way to go.|
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


NT|^B@2
^*BThe Porcupine Lads^*N: Please note Howard prefers Ogust instead of feature. Please refer to his teaching movie at |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=ogust^*N|CP||

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I just looked up "BROMAD" to refresh my memory. According to the Bridgebum's web site, |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgebum.com/bromad.php^*N|CP||AT| if you play BROMAD, 2@D shows 10+ points and 3 spades.|
PG| ***** 127 ***** |


AT|
jkk9175: Yes. Ours is a little diff.|
PG| ***** 128 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Then you should not mention BROMAD at all. In fact, in general, when alerting, you should avoid the use of convention names. You should just explain what your bids mean in terms of how many HCP they show and what distribution they show and be as precise as you can.|
PG| ***** 129 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's discuss alternatives for bidding after North doubles. I recommend that you play Bergen raises over the double, just as if there were no double. |
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Assuming you play regular (not reverse) Bergen:
^c3@C by East would be 7-9 with 4 spades
^c3@D would be 10-12 with 4 spades. 
^C Reverse 3@C and 3@D if you play reverse Bergen Raises.|
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Then there is the matter of "Jordan 2NT" where, if not playing Bergen Raises, 2NT by East would show 4 spades and 10+ points. But, since, now 3@D shows that bid (or 3@C if playing reverse Bergen) I play 2NT shows 10+ points and 3 card support.|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is an addition to what I play called "BROMAD" (it has other names also) |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgebum.com/bromad.php^*N|CP||AT|. Playing BROMAD 2@C and 2@D are convectional 3-card raises, similar to 3@C and 3@D but with 3-card support.|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So, if playing regular Bergen 2@C over double would show 7-9 with 3-card support (analogous to 3@C showing 7-9 with 4-card support) and 2@D would show 10+ with 3-card support (analogous to 3@D showing 10+ with 4-card support).|
PG| ***** 134 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you play reverse Bergen just reverse 2@C/2@D and 3@C/3@D. In summary, I recommend you play 3@C/3@D as Bergen raises over a double. As to whether you play 2@C/2@D as 3-card raises I am neutral.|
PG| ***** 135 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A Kib: Which is better regular Bergen or reverse Bergen?|
PG| ***** 136 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I am neutral about that. I asked Marty Bergen and he basically said the same thing.  Bergen was essentially neutral about whether to play reverse Bergen or not. He said he had a slight preference for regular Bergen (e.g. 3@D is the limit raise) but only because it is slightly more likely you want to leave extra room over the constructive raise than limit raise.|
PG| ***** 137 ***** |


NT|^B@2
He basically said that it didn't really matter whether you played regular or reverse so long as you played Bergen raises. |
PG| ***** 138 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A Kib:  Our best players use reverse Bergen-say it gives more room for side suit game tries.|
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Bergen's contention is that it is harder to decide when to bid game when there is a constructive raise (7-9) than a limit raise, so playing 3@C as constructive is slightly better since that's when you need the extra room. But many players do reverse Bergen for the very reason that the Kib cited. They want more room to explore over the limit raise.|

BROMAD was created by American expert Marty Bergen in the 1980s.}
^-|cs||fp||ht|h|at|^-Movie Released: August 28, 2016
^-|ht|i|at|^B@2BROMAD is an acronym for "Bergen Raises of a Major After a Double." It is a set of conventional raises by responder after hearing a 1@H/1@S opening bid and an opposing takeout double:|
ht|k|at|^A  Bid|HT|k|AT|^d@2Meaning|
Ht|l|at|^A  XX   	^DRedouble is not part of BROMAD, but is worth mentioning. It shows 10+ points and denies 3+ card support.
^A  2@C  	^DA 3-card "Constructive" raise, showing 7-10 points and exactly 3-card trump support.
^A  2@D  	^DA 3-card "Limit" raise or better, showing 10+ points and exactly 3-card trump support.
^A  2@H/2@S 	^DA 3-card "Preemptive" raise, showing 0-6 points and exactly 3-card trump support.
^A  2NT  	^DA preempt in clubs or diamonds (i.e. a hand that would normally make a 3 or 3@D weak jump shift).
^A  3@C  	^DA 4-card "Constructive" raise, showing 7-10 points and exactly 4-card trump support. 
^A  3@D  	^DA 4-card "Limit" raise, showing 10-12 points and exactly 4-card trump support. 
^A  3@H/3@S ^dA 4-card "Preemptive" raise, showing 0-6 points and exactly 4-card trump support. 

^B@2BROMAD assumes that the partnership plays 5-card majors. The theory is to reach the correct level of bidding in accordance with the Law of Total Tricks.

Note that the preemptive direct raises (i.e. 1@S : 2/3@S) are based on the principle of fast arrival. They are designed rob the opponents of bidding space as quickly as possible.

^bThe BROMAD 3-level responses are identical to Bergen Raises, which are systemic raises used in uncontested auctions. A few examples are next.|

They might sneak in an extra trick in spades and/or hearts, but coming to 8 tricks would be difficult. So I suspect we end up with about the same score (50 or 100) that we ended up with making 2@S.|
