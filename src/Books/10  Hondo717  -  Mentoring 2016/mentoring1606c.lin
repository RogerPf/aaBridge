She could still have recovered if she had not played the club and pitched a spade. After ruffing the diamond, now play a heart to the ace, ruff a diamond. So the best play is to just play the @HA and never let me in.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the bidding. There is always an issue in a competitive auction when you have the minor suit and they have a major suit as to whether or not to bid 4 of your minor. If you do, you have to decide whether or not you will be happy if they bid 4 of their major.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you will not be happy, you probably should not bid 4 of your minor. I wasn't sure, but I decided I had a likely 3 tricks (turns out I did not have any club tricks) and I thought it likely pard had 1 trick. So I decided to bid 4@C because I thought there was a good chance 4@H would go down.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although Roger's bid is technically correct, most people no longer play that 1NT is a strong NT if both opponents have bid. That is because a) it rarely comes up (since the opponents have around 20, it is rare that you will have 15-18) and b) even if you do have a strong NT, partner is almost always weak.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So many people play that 1NT by West is something called a "sandwich NT." So on this hand, if you play sandwich NT Roger has to pass, which is not necessarily a bad thing.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I do like to bid, but I tend to be much less aggressive in competition with flat hands. I am not sure what to do here. I might very well double in Match Points. We have the majority of the points, and my partner, who has strength, is sitting behind Roger so most of his finesses are losing. Further, he won't have many entries to the board either. If he were vul, double would be clear. Not vul, with us vul, it is not as clear.|mb|d|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have a tutorial on that, |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=scoring^*N|CP||AT| on my website. |
pg| ***** 71 ***** |


nt|^B@2
But essentially and briefly, there are 2 important differences.
a) in IMPs, you stretch to bid game. in Match Points you only bid games that are likely to make.|
PG| ***** 72 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|b) in IMPs, in partials, any plus is good. In Match Points, setting them is often not as good as making a contract yourself. That is because in Match Points, the size of your score doesn't matter. What matters is how many pairs you beat in score, even if only by 10 points.|
PG| ***** 73 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That means, for example, if Roger were vul, and I doubled him and we beat him only 1, in IMPs, if we make 150 or so, then -200 is not that much better. But in Match Points, plus 200 will be better than any partial we can make and we get a top score. There are other points as well, but that covers the major differences. At the teaching table I play IMPs because that is what we play on BBO.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me, as promised, explain what I could have done after Yumiko pass before my double. Because of the undo problem in BBO teaching table, I couldn't have Yumiko undo her last bid.|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Had I been able to give undos, I would have suggested Yumiko use "DONT Runouts." Once Margaret passes the double, if Yumiko bids a suit, that says she wants to play in either that suit or a higher suit. For example if she bid 2@C, that says she has clubs and another suit. If Roger didn't like clubs (he does on this hand), he would bid 2@D and Yumiko would pass or bid her 2nd suit.|
PG| ***** 90 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If she redoubled, then that would show a 1 suited hand. Roger would bid 2@C and Yumiko would bid her suit (or pass with clubs). The idea is that Runouts over 1N are similar to the DONT convention for competing over 1NT.|
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In summary, any suit bid by responder over the double of partner's 1N show that suit and a higher suit. And redouble (similar to a DONT double) shows a single suit.|
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It is rare you get doubled playing a strong NT, so I wouldn't worry about playing DONT runouts too much—but it would have worked well here. However, those of us who play weak NT get doubled a lot so we need a good runout scheme and DONT runouts are very good.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@S is a pretty iffy contract. We have a sure heart loser and a sure spade loser. And if they start with the @SA and a low spade, it would be very difficult to make, even with both minor suit kings being onside. So my 2@S bid turned out to work out well. On the other hand, note that it is easy to get the defense to misdiscard—11th trick.|
PG| ***** 117 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So whenever you are playing a contract and have all winners but one, just play out your winners. Sometimes the defense will make a mistake and throw away the wrong card, as Yumiko did here.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|It looks as though our foresight has paid off. Our spade switch at trick 2 has enabled the defense to obtain a spade ruff as well as a diamond ruff.
 
This deal has been all about taking our tricks in the right order.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|The contract has been beaten. You can try to beat it by two by leading another diamond (that would make South's 2@H bid a contender for Wacko bid of the year but you never know...!).|

nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding: 
Opening 1NT with South's (your LHO) hand is perfectly fine even though it contains a five-card heart suit. South would have a major (no pun intended) rebid problem if the auction continues 1@H - (Pass) - 1@S or 1NT - (Pass) - back to him. |
PG| ***** 208 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Over your natural 2@D bid, South can now reveal his five card suit via 2@H in which North invites to 3@H and ends the auction. |
PG| ***** 209 ***** |


NT|^b@2Play: 
It is clear that the @D2 is from a singleton. Partner cannot have led from @DJ x 2 for that would give declarer a singleton, and declarer cannot (shouldn't) have a singleton for a 1NT opening bid!|
PG| ***** 210 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Assuming we will win the first trick, what's our plan to the second trick? |
PG| ***** 211 ***** |


aT|Sure we can give partner a ruff. But what's the rush? What can partner profitably return after ruffing our diamond return? (Take note that hearts are 5-3-3-2 around the table, so partner has a doubleton heart) |
PG| ***** 212 ***** |


NT|^b@2
If our partner has the @CA then it doesn't matter what we do since the contract is always off (provided that we give our partner a diamond ruff at some point). However, what if partner does not have the @CA? |
PG| ***** 213 ***** |


NT|^b@2
We should therefore conclude that a spade return at trick 2 is best. As tempting as it may seem to give partner a diamond ruff, or to return the @CK at trick 2 (dummy's weakness in the club suit), we must instead switch to our doubleton spade.|
PG| ***** 214 ***** |


NT|^b@2
The @CK switch is unnecessary since if partner has the @CA, we can always get two clubs, one diamond, one diamond ruff, and the @HA for one off (i.e. our club tricks aren't running away). |
PG| ***** 215 ***** |


NT|^b@2
And giving partner a diamond ruff immediately won't help our cause either to beat this contract. Therefore, a spade return hoping that our partner has the @SA or @SK is just enough for us to beat this contract. |
PG| ***** 216 ***** |


NT|^b@2
We return a spade in which partner wins with the @SK and returns back the @SJ as declarer wins in dummy with the queen. |
PG| ***** 217 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Declarer now advances with dummy's @HJ and we must now rise to the occasion by hopping up with the ace (we know from the auction that partner has a doubleton heart and we must make sure that partner has a second heart to ruff with on our diamond return).|
PG| ***** 218 ***** |


NT|^b@2
After winning the @HA we return the @D10, a clear suit-preference signal for spades, as partner ruffs and obliges with our plan and gives us a spade ruff.|
PG| ***** 219 ***** |


NT|^b@2
It seems as if our foresight has paid big dividends. Our spade switch at trick 2 enabled our partner to return a (very) effective spade after ruffing the diamond, to let us ruff the spade, which as it turns out was the setting trick. |

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|With five tricks in the bank - and that's all you need - your interest on this deal is slowly fading. The @DK is an exciting card to see but it does look as though declarer has the @DA.
 
It appears that declarer has the remaining tricks - at least, that is what West is mumbling.|

^B@2^*BAndy Hung: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding.
The opponents have a by-now-familiar auction to 3NT. West opens 1NT, East forces to game by jumping to 3@H and West denies Heart support by insisting on No-trumps.|
PG| ***** 240 ***** |


NT|^b@2Play.
Partner fishes out the @S7 against 3NT. Although the @S7 looks like a fairly high card, we may assume that partner will have striven to lead from his longest and strongest suit. Upon winning the opening lead with our @SA, what should we return? |
PG| ***** 241 ***** |


NT|^b@2
The @DQ looks enticing, very seductive indeed, so is that what we should lead back? No! We know from the opening lead that partner's strength (and length) lies in Spades.|
PG| ***** 242 ***** |


NT|^b@2
When defending we should adopt the standard practice of returning partner's suit. After we have done so here, partner's @SK J gobble up declarer's remaining @SQ 10 and the defense take the first five tricks. One down before West gets his foot in the door.|
PG| ***** 243 ***** |


NT|^b@2
What would have happened had we switched to the @DQ at trick two? Declarer would have taken his Ace and proceeded to take five Hearts and four Clubs in rapid succession for an overtrick. Partner (rather like Britain's Queen Victoria) would not have been amused. |
PG| ***** 244 ***** |


NT|^b@2
A sound general rule here is to lead back partner's suit unless it is obvious not to do so. If we do decide to shift to another suit we had better have a good reason for doing so...|
PG| ***** 245 ***** |


NT|^b@2
One further point. Although it matters little on this deal it is the right play to lead back the higher card from a doubleton. When we have the @S9 4 left at trick two we should lead the @S9 rather than the @S4. On some deals (trust us!) that will be important. |

cs||fp||cp|8|AT|^b@2^*BLarry Cohen|CP||AT|^*N: In Part 1 of this article, we discussed responding to a low-level takeout double. The gist of it was that notrump bids show values and a stopper(s). Suit bids show 0-8 except for jumps. A single-jump after partner makes a takeout double shows about 9-11.|
PG| ***** 249 ***** |


AT|

What about if the takeout double is of a high-level bid (like 3@S or 4@H)? There is not as much room, so the ranges are a bit less defined. Here is a rough approximation of responses to a 3-level takeout double:|
PG| ***** 250 ***** |


AT|

^*B3 of a suit (or 4 of a suit without jumping): 0-8 (approximate), 4+ card suit

3NT: Stopper, some values (probably about 8-13 -- wide range!)

Jump to game: 10-15 (approximate), 4+ card suit

Jump to 4NT: Probably Blackwood (but some expert pairs might define it as natural, invitational).^*N|

Your call is 3@H. Not good-enough clubs to leave in the double (especially with a decent alternative). Not strong enough for 4@H (you need a little more to jump from a 3-level takeout double than after a lower-level takeout double). Not enough strength for 3NT. |

4S should be your call. Plenty enough to bid game (way too strong for only 3@S).|

Select 4NT. This is takeout and suggests 2 places to play. The doubler will bid the cheapest 4-card suit he has. If it is clubs, so be it--it is okay to play in 5@C. If he pulls to diamonds, you will correct to 5@H. |

Pass. Hope to set them (partner has a good hand). Don't take out at this level without decent distribution.|
