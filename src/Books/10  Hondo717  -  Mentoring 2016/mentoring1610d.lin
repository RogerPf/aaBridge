NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the bidding. It turns out that it makes 5 clubs as well. The problem with bidding 2@C or 2@S is that they are underbids. |
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT|^B@2
3@C is a slight overbid  because with no fit, they might not have game. So I probably bid 3@S which can either be passed or East can bid 3N.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT|^B@2
3N is down 1 probably. They have 5 clubs, 1 diamond, and 2 spades when the spade finesse works. |
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT|^B@2
5@C might make depending on how it is played. The best way in 5@C is to take the spade finesse and ruff a spade. Regardless, this is a hard hand to bid and play.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Always remember that distributional hands are worth much more than their HCP indicate. That is very important. HCP are overrated and distribution is underrated by most players. Watch experts play when they have distributional hands especially with voids. They bid even with few high card points because they know long suits are worth a lot.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Suppose you pick up a hand with a 13 card suit. You only have 10 HCP. Yet you can obviously make 7 if that suit is the trump. In real life that is not going to happen. But it illustrates why long suits are so valuable.|up|28|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Nicely played. Let us discuss West's rebid. 2@H should generally show 4-card support. However, sometimes, you can and should raise with 3 card support. Basically, you should do it when you have a singleton and 3 cards to an honor.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Or a small doubleton and no better bid. In this case, I think with the relatively flat hand, 1NT is a slightly better rebid than 2@H.|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Note that the 1NT rebid simply denies 4-card support and shows a 12-14 balanced hand. It does not necessarily promise stoppers in the unbid suits.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It is unlikely, particularly when the opponents have not overcalled, that they can run a suit in which you don't have a stopper. Partner will often have a stopper, and even if they don't, they at most should be able to take 5 tricks and often only 4.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is an optional opener. Using raw HCP it meets the rule of 20--11 HCP + 9 cards in the red suits = 20. However, using Bergen "adjusted HCP" (the 4 starting point rules other than length) I deduct one for Qx of spades so I only have 10 adjusted HCP.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, I think 1@H is a better description than 2@H. And I also believe there is no gap between a weak 2 and a 1 opener. If you have a 6-card suit, you either have to open a weak 2 or at the 1-level.|mb|1H|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding was fine. With 15 points East should take a bid. If they have a fit, you have a fit. So it is likely their side has a fit somewhere although East only has 3 spades. Therefore, double is reasonable and probably the best call.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT|^B@2
What would be a 2N instead? It is not even clear that 2N shows a strong hand. In fact, there is an argument against that in this board. Based on my opening bid and the raise to 2, North/South have at least half the points more or less. |
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So even if East had, say 17 or 18 balanced hand, 2NT would be a dangerous bid because partner rates to have very few HCP. Just as on Hand 1, I said suit length is very important, similarly, flat balanced hands are not as good as their HCP suggest.|
PG| ***** 85 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I would much rather have a 5-5 hand with 10 or 11 HCP than a balanced 15 or 16 HCP hand. The 5-5 hand is likely to take more tricks, because I can set up my long suits.|
PG| ***** 86 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So that means, on this auction, if it goes 1@H-P-2@H-2N, I suggest you play that as takeout for the minors rather than a strong NT. It is not "unusual" in the sense that it promises 5-5, But it is a takeout double with minors often 5-4.|
pg| ***** 87 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Why is, "If they have a fit you have a fit?"|
pg| ***** 88 ***** |


AT| Let's say, for example, they have a 9 card fit. That means your side only has 4-cards in their suit meaning your side has 22 cards in the other 3 suits.|
PG| ***** 89 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Therefore, mathematically you must have at least one 8-card fit. Even if they have an 8-card fit your side has 21 cards outside their suit giving you three 7 card fits. But you most likely have at least one 8-card fit.|
pg| ***** 90 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to the lead, in general you should avoid leading away from honors. However, since West has 3 suits with honors, unless she wants to lead a trump (which is conceivable) she has to lead away from an honor.|
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It turns out leading your longest suit with an honor is usually best. Also if you have to lead away from an honor, it turns out leading away from a queen turns out to be the least bad alternative most often.|
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Leading away for a jack is my last choice. Further, leading away from a king could be right but is slightly more likely to give something away.|
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Actually, I would have led a heart. But if you made me lead a non-trump suit, I would have chosen a club. It was my longest suit and it also is leading away for a queen. That doesn't mean I would have been right.|
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Often what to lead is a guess. As a proof, some of the cheating scandals in world class bridge, most often have to do with telling partner what suit to lead. Because it is easy even for experts to make an opening lead favorable for declarer. |
PG| ***** 95 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In this board, it turns out if West leads a club or a spade I lose 1 spade, 1 heart, 2 clubs and 1 diamond most likely and go down 1. Again showing that the opening lead is often the most important part of defense.|

North lost 3 finesses. The spade finesse, the club finesse, and the heart finesse. If any of those work, 4@H makes. It will make over 85% of the time. It is certainly a contract you want to be in.|

If West cashed the @CA and @CK first, then she would have to get back to her hand to cash the 5th clubs. There is no reason for that. Here with 9-card clubs it does not matter.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The bidding:
Once there is a takeout double, you have an extra bid available, redouble. You should use it when appropriate. First you need to decide what bids are forcing over the double.|
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I play that any bid, over a double, other than redouble or 2NT (which is known as "Jordan 2N" and shows a limit+ raise in opener's suit) shows less than 10 points and is not forcing.|
PG| ***** 151 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, the more common way to play is that 1-level bids over a double are forcing and 2-level bids are not. Even if you play that, there is no reason for East to bid 1S over the double.|
PG| ***** 152 ***** |


NT|^B@2
North is likely showing spades and East's spades are not that great. So redouble, showing 10+ points is by far the best bid. Once East redoubles. West should realize with 15 HCP that their side should be in game.|
PG| ***** 153 ***** |


NT|^B@2
What West should bid depends on their agreements. You could play that jump shifts by West are still game forcing but are not 18+. If you play that, then West can bid 2@H which should show 15+ and 4 hearts and probably 5 clubs.|
PG| ***** 154 ***** |


NT|^B@2
East can then bid either 2N or 3N which is where they should end up. But the most important point is for West to realize once East redoubles, their side must get to game.|

PG| ***** 264 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
It's good practice to lead your partner's suit when he has overcalled. It saves on medical bills. East is an honorable guy so must have a five-card (or six-card) suit to overcall.|
