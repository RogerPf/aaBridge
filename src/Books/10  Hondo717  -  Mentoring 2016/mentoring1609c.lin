^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let's discuss how to bid over a double. First of all most everyone agrees to the following:
a) if you redouble you are showing 10+ points and no more than 3-card support for partner. With 10+ and 4-card support, the standard bid is 2NT known as Jordan 2NT.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However I play something different. I play Bergen Raises over doubles. So 3@C, 3@D, and 3@H retain the same meaning as if there were no double. Since 3@C or 3@D is a 4-card limit raise, I play 2NT as a 3-card limit raise.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You could also play BROMAD (Bergen Raise Over Major And Double) |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?ndf=bromad^*N|CP||AT|. If you played that the 2@C, 2@D, and 2@H are 3-card raises. So 2@C and 2@D show the same points as 3@C and 3@D but only a 3-card raise. And 2@H is a very weak 3-card raise.|
PG| ***** 3 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Having said all that, I obviously can't raise partner. The question now is, what bids, if any are forcing, other than redouble. I play if you make any bid other than redouble or an artificial raise, that is not forcing.|
pg| ***** 4 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, the more common (and more confusing) way to play is that 1 level bids are forcing and 2 level bids are not. So if I bid 1@S that is forcing. I can bid it with less than 10 points but I might have more. But if I bid 2@D for example, that is definitely less than 10 points.|
PG| ***** 5 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I find that confusing so I just play if I bid any natural new suit over a double it is not forcing.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


NT|^B@2
What about pass vs bidding?|
pg| ***** 7 ***** |


AT| Some people think you have to have extra values to bid. That is not exactly true. You just have to have something to say that you want partner to know.|
pg| ***** 8 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So I might decide I want to tell partner about my spades and bid 1@S. Or I might want to tell her I have some diamonds and bid 2@D. On this hand I like 2@D best because it takes up extra room and we are not likely to have a spade fit. In the ideal world I would like to have had either better diamonds or an extra diamond.|
PG| ***** 9 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A Kib:  Why would 2@D shows less than 10 points while you need 10+ to bid it at 2 level?|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes. 2@D denies 10 points. With 10 points I would redouble.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let us discuss the auction. Several Kibs by looking at the four hands, already opined that East should have bid 3N after the 3@C by West. Not so fast. First let us accept the 3@C call though as I said I prefer the 2N instead.|
PG| ***** 54 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West has 15 HCP. However, the hand looks like sort of a misfit. 3@D by East is what is known as a preference. Some call it a "false preference."  East is probably showing a doubleton diamond, perhaps with an honor, but she might even have 2 small or 10x. |
PG| ***** 55 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So given the misfit I probably just bid 3NT with the West hand. Hoping the AK of hearts combined with a diamond card in the East hand will mean West can take at least 9 tricks, 5 diamonds 2 hearts, and a couple of tricks in the other suits.|
PG| ***** 56 ***** |


NT|^B@2
5@D does also make, but 3NT will generally be easier. However, once West decided to try for 6, which was aggressive but not totally unreasonable, then they have to end up in 5 of a minor. Now let us go back to 3@C bid.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT|^B@2
After West's 3@C bid, here is the issue. Is 3@C really clubs or not? There is no agreement from experts on this but here is what I think. It should be totally artificial, often asking if partner has a club stopper. Why?|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Because if West has a club stopper he can bid 2NT. EW is already in a game forcing auction and East has shown 9+ cards in the majors. East can only have at most 4 cards in the minors. So the likelihood of a club fit is virtually zero. So there is no reason for 3@C to be natural.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Since East does not have a club stopper, over 3@C she must make some other bid below 3NT. With DAJ, I like the 3@D bid.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As I mentioned, I think the problem is West's 3@C bid. I think West should bid 2N. On this hand East will probably just raise to 3N. But with another hand, say 5 spades, 4 hearts, 3 diamonds, and 1 club, East could bid 3@D to show her distribution and express possible interest in slam.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The conservative 2@S bid is fine, but I would not fault someone if they chose to treat the hand as a 3-card limit raise.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have 15 Starting Points. Once partner supports I can add 2 for the singleton, and another 1 for the 6th spade pushing my hand's value to 18 Declarer Points. If partner has 9 we have enough for game. |
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, I am a bit worried because my spades are weak. If partner has, say Kxx, I could easily lose 2 or even 3 tricks. And if partner has diamond points, they may be wasted.|
PG| ***** 65 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So in match points I might very well pass, figuring most people with "high card point itis" would pass my "13" point hand. In IMPs though, it might be worth exploring especially if vulnerable. So let's make an exploratory bid.|mb|3C|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My bid now asks North to value club points and bid 4 if she either likes clubs or has a maximum 2@S raise.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT|^B@2
North has a clear 4@S bid. The hand is worth 10 Dummy Points--8 HCP, 1 doubleton, and 1 length point. In fact, the original 2@S was a bit of an underbid, although I think it was reasonable.|
PG| ***** 68 ***** |


mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@S is far from cold, but I have been in worse. I could lose 3 spades and a diamond on a bad day. But if spades are 2-2 it always makes. And if the @S10 is singleton or one of the high spade honors is singleton and I guess who has it, I rate to only lose 2 spades even if spades are 3-1.|
PG| ***** 69 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In general I will only lose 2 spades. The problem is where to get a 10th trick. If spades are 2-2 it is by a club ruff. If they are not and they lead trump getting rid of 3 trump before I can ruff a club, I have to hope I can set up my 5th diamond for a discard.|

PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT|^B@2
A Kib:  I didn't understand 3@C bid. Usually with this bid you are asking for help in this suit.|
pg| ***** 80 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes, 3@C is asking if North has help in clubs and inviting game. So pard should bid game if:
 ^Ca) she has a max 2@S bid, AND/OR 
 ^Cb) she has some clubs that fit well with me.|
pg| ***** 81 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|An honor in clubs is best, but a doubleton is not necessarily a bad thing either. But certainly on this hand, with 10 dummy points, North has a clear 4@S bid over any invitation.|
PG| ***** 82 ***** |


NT|^B@2
For example, if I just bid 3@S, North should you bid 4S. North has the best hand you she possibly have. North promised 6-9 with the 2S bid. However, in reality, North has 10 Dummy points--a better hand than she promised.|
PG| ***** 83 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The point is, an invite other than 3@S is sort of a 2 way try. It says bid 4 if you have a good 8+ or bid 4 if you have 7 or 8 with a nice fit in the suit where opener needs help.|
PG| ***** 84 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
A Kib:  Could North bid 3@H over the 3@C bid, saying I can't help you in Clubs, but I can help you in Hearts?|
pg| ***** 85 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@H would be a reasonable bid over 3@C. But personally once partner tries for game, since I have 10 dummy points I would bid 4 regardless. I have better than the best hand I should have.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Certainly 3NT is not the best bid at this point. I think 4 spades is pretty much the best bid. Even opposite a small doubleton, it has plays.

PG| ***** 89 ***** |


NT|^B@2
It might make 3NT, and in Match Points it might make the same number of tricks in both NT and spades, but in general, 4@S is going to be a much safer contract than 3NT.|

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@S is an interesting call. It depends on what you play it as. I play it as a slam try in spades with 6 nice spades and at least 19 declarer points. It shows a much stronger hand than 4@S does.|
PG| ***** 92 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As it turns out in 3NT, because north is probably leading a club, NT and spades make about the same number of tricks. But on a diamond lead, I think I would rather be in 4@S.|

You always can take at least 1 heart trick and you won't run out of trump. The way you played it, you had to guess hearts. There is no reason for guessing.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I have an interesting decision here. If partner were not a passed hand, I would bid for sure. My diamond void is absolutely lovely on this auction. I would probably make a takeout double although I generally prefer overcalling a 5 card major to doubling when I am 5-4 in the majors.|
PG| ***** 126 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In this case, I have 5 weak spades and 4 nice hearts so I think double is best. The only thing I am worried about is partner might think I am stronger than I am in terms of doubling.|

NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a hard hand to play, so let's discuss it. It is hard to count winners, but one way to do it is as follows. |
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If you draw trump and they are 3-2, you can count 3 heart winners in length, and 1 ruff for 4 heart winners. |
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You have a spade winner for 5 and 3 club winners for 8. So you need a 9th winner.|
PG| ***** 149 ***** |


NT|^B@2
One easy way to get a 9th winner is to discard on the opening diamond lead. That guarantees your @DK will win a trick. |
PG| ***** 150 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That's the easiest way to play the hand.
There are other alternatives in terms for cross ruffing, but if you see an easy line, by counting winners, you should take it. The whole secret is to count your winners ASAP.|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|An interesting and unexpected dummy - you may have expected a stronger hand with weaker spades. What is irritating (from your perspective) is that you know that that spades are running for six tricks. Declarer doesn't know that but he'll find out soon enough.|
PG| ***** 223 ***** |


NT|^b@2
What you have to do is to play your defense even though there are seven tricks on table so declarer only needs two more. Not only is counting winners and losers restricted to the declarer, but it can also be very beneficial to the defense as well. Does declarer have nine tricks?|
PG| ***** 224 ***** |


NT|^b@2
You can't see a certain nine tricks for declarer, so we aren't in a panic-mode just yet. If declarer has the @hA Q (thus making nine tricks via a successful heart finesse), then there is nothing you can do about it - so let's assume declarer does not have that holding. On the other hand, what can you infer from partner's opening lead?|
PG| ***** 225 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Partner has led from four to an honor but we can't be sure whether it's from the queen or the jack just yet.  If partner has the @cQ then we can set up three club tricks. If partner has the @CJ then we can set up two club tricks (although setting up the second one will be pretty slow since we'd have to knock out declarer's two stoppers). |
PG| ***** 226 ***** |


NT|^b@2
In any case, that's all the information that we can process for now but we'd have to be on our toes and update that information constantly when we continue on with the play.|

PC|C2C9CJ|nt||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Partner's @CJ card means that he had originally led away from the jack, namely @CJ 10 7 3, meaning declarer is (still) in possession of the @CQ, thus providing him with a second club trick. What do you make of that?|
PG| ***** 230 ***** |


NT|^b@2
This means that if declarer has the @HA (i.e. a form of entry back to his hand), that would give him the necessary trick and entry back to his hand for nine tricks and the contract. Guess what? You got it, let's now assume that declarer does not have the @HA!|
PG| ***** 231 ***** |


NT|^b@2
You might be wondering why we can go about making these assumptions - the answer to that, is that we must do it. It doesn't matter if that assumption is wrong because declarer would have his contract anyway. Our one and foremost priority is to defeat the contract and by making these assumptions will guide us through that possibility.|
PG| ***** 232 ***** |


NT|^b@2
So, we have now assumed that declarer does not have the @HA, and we know declarer does hold the @CQ. Is there any other possible entry that declarer might have back to his hand in order to collect his second club trick|

^B@2^*BEddie Kantar: ^*N|cp||at|Whoops! This is now the panic-mode! Given that you have worked out that declarer has the @CQ and on the assumption that declarer has no @HA, what else would that give declarer for his 1NT response? |
PG| ***** 235 ***** |


NT|^b@2
A more important question is: what is going to happen if you play a low diamond on this trick?|
PG| ***** 236 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Declarer will most likely play the @DQ, which then becomes his sole entry to cash his second club trick. Recount: Declarer has six spade tricks, one diamond, and two clubs. This totals up to nine tricks - do we want that? No! Therefore, we must hop up with the @DA|
