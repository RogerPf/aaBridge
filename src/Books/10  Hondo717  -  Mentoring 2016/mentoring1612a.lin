^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The auction was good. Unfortunately slam is a very good contract but hard to reach. Even if I pass 1@H, not sure how they get to 6. If it goes 1@H-P-P, I still think West should bid 4N.|
PG| ***** 22 ***** |


NT|^B@2
jordymil:  I don't think that I knew that 1@H-3@H-4@H was Michaels?|
PG| ***** 23 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As to Jordy's comment about not knowing 4@H was Michaels, not sure what else it should mean. |
PG| ***** 24 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Of course if the North-South suits were spades e.g (on a different hand) the auction started 1@S-P-3@S-? and West had a 2 suiter with hearts, West is stuck. Not wanting to bid 4@S Michaels as that forces to the 5-level|
pg| ***** 25 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Also, a cue bid in the majors is usually Michaels. There is one exception, which does come up from time to time and which many players don't know about. |
PG| ***** 26 ***** |


NT|^B@2
That is if the auction starts 1@H-3@H (overcall of 3@H over 1@H) or 1@S-3@S (overcall of 3@S over 1@S). That is not Michaels since 1@H-2@H or 1@S-2@S is Michaels.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT|^B@2
1@H-3@H (Overcall) and 1@S-3@S (overcall) show that the overcaller has a long running minor and wants to play 3NT if partner has a stopper in opener's suit--hearts or spades.|
pg| ***** 28 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|The other exception that is not Michaels is over a weak-2 in a major. A 3@H overcall over weak 2@H and a 3@S overcall over weak 2@S are also showing a running minor and asking pard to bid 3N with a stopper in opener's suit.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Further, in 2@H-3@H and 2@S-3@S overcalls, if overcaller has a 2 suiter with the other major over a weak 2 the experts play something called "Leaping Michaels."|
pg| ***** 30 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|They play 2@H-4@C shows spades and clubs. Similarly 2@H-4@D shows spades and diamonds.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT|^B@2
And of course 2@S-4@C shows hearts, clubs, 2@S-4@D shows hearts and diamonds, and 2@S-4N or 2@H-4N shows both minors.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Obviously the overcaller only makes those 2 suited bids with very strong hands.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT|^B@2
onenoDavid:  All these bids are 5 - 5 in the 2 suits ?|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Another good bid by West. Double is a "card showing" double or a "do something intelligent" double. It is not strictly penalty. All doubles of 4 level contracts are not strictly penalty. They just show cards, and partner must decide whether to pass for penalty or bid on.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|As to West's question, he should assume East is unbalanced with 5+ diamonds and 4+ clubs.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is possible East West would pass 4@H but not likely given East knows they are short in hearts. As I mentioned I would have passed 4@H with the East hand.|
PG| ***** 43 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Given we are vul, it is quite possible we will go for 500, but 5@C was not completely unreasonable either. When you are short in the opponent's suit, that makes it more likely you want to bid and had the @HA been the @CA or @CKQ then it might be better to bid. |
PG| ***** 44 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But the @HA is worth a sure trick on defense, and does not fit well with partner on offense.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Unlucky hand. East should have obviously saved 1 trick by playing a low spade, but still down 1. Of course North could have just returned a club, in which case the hand is always down 2.|
PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Let's see how we do in 4@H. We lose 2 diamonds, 1 spade, 1 heart, and 1 club for down 2. So pass by East was clearly best especially at this vulnerability. |
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Please remember that West's double is not purely penalty, and it is not purely takeout either. If you have defense you should pass. If you have offense you should bid.|
PG| ***** 59 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Offense is defined by your having a long suit and shortness in their suit. So East did have some offense, but had more defense IMO. East can assume the doubler has 1-2 tricks, so it would be unusual for 4@H to not be down at least 1.|

jordymil:  Is it good to interfere if you can, considering the vulnerability?|
PG| ***** 62 ***** |


cp|8|AT|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Yes. 2@H with your hand would be a reasonable but slightly risky bid. However, you need to realize the following.|
PG| ***** 63 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The 2@C opener almost always ends up as declarer. So if you can overcall over 2@D, you can make a lead directing bid for partner. Note that it is less desirable for West to overcall over 2@C because West is likely to be on lead. However, even West should try and interfere when appropriate over 2@C.|
PG| ***** 64 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, any time you can interfere that is a good thing for your side and a hindrance for the opponents.|

PG| ***** 66 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Let me explain "2nd negative" after a 2@D by responder. The way I play, if North bids 3@C that shows a weak hand. 3@C is completely artificial. It just says responder has a weak hand. Almost always no aces or kings.|
PG| ***** 67 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Here North has a king, but with not great spade support and a flat hand and no other high cards, I think 3@C is still fine. Plus he has no other good bid. 3@H would take the auction too high and 2N is iffy without anything in diamonds.|mb|3C|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So it is better to compete and not worry about occasionally missing game. Of course, you and partner have to agree that 2@C is more distributional than strong. Were you not vul, you could even make a case for 3@C.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Regarding my passing with opening hand, Where am I going by bidding on? We have no fit. What bid do you suggest?|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|And end up playing 3@D instead of 2@D, no thanks. Even if partner shows a feature, it is unlikely we can make 3N. But I agree many players would bid 2N (incorrectly IMO).|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West does not have Michaels distribution, A takeout double is  right. First of all partner will strain to bid a major and 2nd of all, you do have 3 clubs if pard happens to bid clubs. Even if you were 4432 (e.g. 3 diamonds and 2 clubs) I would still double.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|This is a suit preference for hearts. My high club means I want the higher suit (hearts). A low club would mean I wanted a diamond back (the lower suit). Proper defensive carding is crucial to playing good defense 2nd only to counting the hand.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So you can see that even "bid em up" Howard sometimes thinks pass is a good idea. In this case it was right to pass. We would have gotten in trouble if I bid. |
PG| ***** 143 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Whenever partner preempts and you are short in their suit that is very bad for offense. So you want to pass and hope you can defeat them.|

PG| ***** 161 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Although slam goes down on a diamond lead, it is still a reasonable slam. It makes on a non-diamond lead or if the spade finesse works. It is well over 50%.|
PG| ***** 162 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Once again, this is a slam that many pairs would not bid. But due to Bergen hand evaluation (both East's opening and West's declarer point evaluation) they got there.|

There's nothing we can do about diamonds, the Ace is either onside or it isn't, but we have a two-way finesse in spades.

PG| ***** 188 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
If he had led a minor suit card it would have been a ruff-and-discard - we would have thrown a spade from table and ruffed in hand. Now we could only lose to the @SA. |

up|36|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*BPaul Bowyer: ^*N|cp||at|Getting the opponents to resolve guesses for you is an important part of the game. Here, in 4@H, you have a two-way finesse in Spades – if you fail to locate the position of the @SJ you will lose two Spade tricks and two Diamond tricks.|
PG| ***** 193 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So, how do you find out which opponent has the crucial black Jack? Well, you just make the opponents do all the work for you.|
PG| ***** 194 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Best play, after the @CQ lead, is to cash the two top Clubs, throwing a Diamond and ruff a Club (with the @HJ – partly for safety, partly for later entries to dummy). When all that passes off smoothly you can draw trumps in two rounds, cross to table with a Heart and lead a Diamond to the @DK.|
PG| ***** 195 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If East has the @DA then 4@H is cold, of course, but here West can cash two Diamonds. However, he then is stuck for a lead. If he gives you a ruff-and-discard you can pitch a Spade from table and ruff in hand. |
PG| ***** 196 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now you only have one Spade loser. A Spade lead (which is what any West will do in practice) neatly picks up the Spade suit for just one loser. Easy!|
