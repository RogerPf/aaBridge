^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@D is a possible rebid and might very well be the best choice. However other possibilities include 2@C and 3@D. North's hand is much more powerful than it's HCP indicate. If you use Bergen hand evaluation it has 13 HCP, 2 length points, and 2 quality suit points.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So it is probably worth a 3@D bid. I would probably bid 2@C intending to bid 3@D over a 2@D preference by South. However, in this case it doesn't really matter.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|First the squeeze. At trick 11 West was stuck. She could either throw off her @SQ setting up dummy's jack or (correctly) discard a club and hope her partner had the @C10. But since North had the @C10, it ended up being good.|
PG| ***** 27 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Squeezes are actually pretty easy to execute in many cases, Whenever you have all the tricks but one, if you run off all your winners, the opponents will often have discarding problems. And when they do, you may be able to set up an extra trick with one of your low cards.|
PG| ***** 28 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You don't even really have to count. Just watch the discards to see if you have set up an extra trick.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |

cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East is correct in that had he led a 3rd spade, the hand only makes 4 obviously. But since he didn't North was able to execute the squeeze.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now let me review my comment about the bidding. When 3 suits have been bid, and no one has raised, meaning NT is a likely contract. If someone then bids the 4th suit, that is artificial and asks about a stopper in the 4th suit.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In many cases the 4th suit is simply the 4th suit forcing to game convention, when responder bids the 4th suit. But when opener bids the 4th suit, that is a stopper ask. The reason being that if opener has a stopper in the 4th suit they can and should bid NT.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So DONT worked out OK, but not great here. If North passes, EW probably end up in 1N. In that case, I lead a heart and I think EW end up taking 1 heart, 4 diamonds, 1 spade and 1 club trick and make 1NT. Let us change the bidding.|

rwloy: Should North have a stronger hand to play DONT?|
pg| ***** 58 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Perhaps at that vul (unfavorable, NS vul and EW not) DONT was a little aggressive. But North has a quality club suit and 5 spades. So I would bid DONT personally, but I wouldn't criticize a pass.|
pg| ***** 59 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|On the other hand, if North had the same cards in the black suits and was 3-1 in the red suits, it makes North's hand even better. Singletons and voids are extremely valuable in suit contracts.|
PG| ***** 60 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Therefore, with 3-1 in the red suits North has a clear DONT bid even at unfavorable and a possible but aggressive DONT bid with the 2-2 that he had.|

mb|1H|mb|P?|nt||lb|*bBid for East.^^2c|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East has the dreaded strong hand with 3-card support which means East must bid a new suit first and raise hearts later.|mb|2C|

mb|P|mb|2H|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|2@H, showing the 6th heart is the bid I would have chosen for West. But 2@S is another possible bid when EW are playing 2 over 1 game forcing. That is not a reverse once a game force is established the way most play these days.|
PG| ***** 91 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, some play a 2@S bid by West does show extra values even playing 2 over 1. If responder has 4 Spades he can then show them and West can raise. |
pg| ***** 92 ***** |


mb|P|mb|3H|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@H bid shows 3-card heart support (or good 2-card support since opener showed 6), but it also is a slam try. East has 16 Bergen Dummy Points--12 HCP, 2 length points. 2 points for the singleton. That is good enough to make a slam try of 3@H.|
PG| ***** 93 ***** |


NT|^B@2
East with a weaker had might decide that he has a minimum game force and use the principle of "fast arrival" by bidding 4@H. 4@H would say that East has good heart support but a very minimum game forcing hand.|
PG| ***** 94 ***** |


NT|^B@2
"Fast Arrival" means, once you are in a game forcing auction, the faster you get to game, the weaker your hand is. On this auction 4@H is a weaker bid than 3@H.|
pg| ***** 95 ***** |


mb|P?|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Now West has to decide if interested in slam. If not, West can bid 4@H. On the other hand, West would start control bidding if he feels strong enough for a slam.|

nt||lb|*bBid for West assuming you are as good as Howard^^4h|mb|3S|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|3@S is reasonable, but I would have bid 4@H. There is the "6-4" bid more, but the void in partner's clubs plus the lack of aces would make me more conservative and bid 4@H. Let's see how this works out.|

mb|P|mb|4D|an|first or second control in diamonds|
pg| ***** 100 ***** |


mb|P|mb|4S|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East had 2 choices here. I like 4N. But with a "min" slam try, since EW have shown controls in all the suits another possibility would be for East to bid 4@H saying that he had a minimum slam try and would be willing to stop in 4@H unless West wanted to go on.|
PG| ***** 101 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, I think with the nice 6-card club suit, I would bid 4N just as East did. Having said that, I recommend that you think about switching to the "kickback" version of roman key card where, when hearts are trump, 4@S is RKCB--kickback.|
PG| ***** 102 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On this auction 4@S by East would be RKCB "kickback" and the answers are (assuming 1430):|
PG| ***** 103 ***** |


mb|p?|NT|^B@2
^C4N = 1 or 4
^C5@C = 0 or 3
^C5@D = 2 no HQ
^C5@H = 2 with trump Queen.|
PG| ***** 104 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Further, let's discuss how West might show a "useful" void in response to RKCB. On this hand, given East bid clubs, a club void is definitely NOT useful. |
PG| ***** 105 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But if West thought it were useful, and slam was likely he could jump to 6@C to show a club void and 1 or 3 key cards. And could bid 5N to show an unspecified void with 2 or 4 key cards. |
PG| ***** 106 ***** |

However on this hand, I would just ignore the club void and respond normally.|

NT|^B@2
When West finds the hearts are 2-2. West can count 2 club tricks (the @CK dropped on first trick and @CQ) and 7 trump tricks, (6 in hand plus spade ruff in dummy). So 2 more tricks are needed. So after pulling 2nd trump in dummy, I would lead a spade.|
pg| ***** 129 ***** |


pc|s8|NT|^B@2
A good defender would duck the @SA but most defenders would not because of the singleton in dummy. And therefore if South does not pop with the @SA I would play the @SJ.|
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


NT|^B@2
However, let's assume I pop the spade ace.|
PC|SAS2S6|
PG| ***** 131 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now West is up to 10 tricks. The question is, should West have discarded a 2nd diamond on the @CQ or not before playing spades (once the @CK drops at trick 1).|
PG| ***** 132 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So bottom line is before playing, West needs to come up with a plan to take 11 tricks. There are 2 chances for an 11th trick. Either South has the @DA and the 2nd chance is the @SQ dropping after 2 spade ruffs.|
PG| ***** 133 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On this hand either play works as it turns out and the hand can be made. In any case, it is very difficult hand to declare.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East has 4 choices:

3@S = minimum with 3 spades
4@S = maximum with 3 spades.|
PG| ***** 139 ***** |


NT|^B@2
2N is shows an invitational hand with 5 spades. So East has a clear 4@S bid since she has a maximum NT with 3 spades. Had she bid 3@S, West should pass. With 4 spades East would have super accepted by bidding 3@S over 2@H.|

pc|D8|sb|s|cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|My partner misled me with the diamond signal. The @D8 is encouraging. Sometimes you would play the @D8 with a doubleton if I led from a high sequence (such as A from AK, or K from KQ) hoping for a ruff.|
PG| ***** 144 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But when I lead the @DJ, I don't have the A, K, or Q. So there is no chance for a ruff. Therefore partner should play a low diamond to indicate he has nothing in diamonds. The J logically denies the KJ. I wouldn't lead the J from KJ on this auction.|pc|D4|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|East played the spade suit very well. With the Q109, missing the K and J, taking 2 finesses against North is a good way to play the suit. It works any time North has at least 1 spade honor. The alternative line of low to the SA and low back to the @SQ is another possibility. |
PG| ***** 147 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But if South plays low smoothly on the 2nd spade (admittedly most non-experts would hesitate with the @SK) then East has to guess whether to play the @SQ or @S10. Playing the way East played she doesn't have to worry about guessing. |
PG| ***** 148 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On this hand it turns out either play works because I happen to have a doubleton honor. But if I had 3 to an honor, then a guess would be required. So leading the @SQ is a better approach.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It turns out because of my fortunate (for East) opening lead 4 spades should make. I am probably leading the @DJ from from @DJ10 and therefore East should win the first diamond in hand, and finesse the @D9 at some point. That will give East a 4th diamond trick for her 10th trick.|
PG| ***** 161 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On the other hand, the reason that 4@S (which should be bid) is difficult is because of the bad fit. In the sense that 2 clubs opposite 2 clubs is bad. If West had a 3rd club instead of 3 hearts, then a club ruff would yield a 10th trick.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Normally you don't lead the opps' suit. And you certainly normally wouldn't lead a suit on opening lead that declarer (to your right) bid. However, there is one exception.|
PG| ***** 168 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If declarer can easily have a 3 or 4 card suit, you have a 5-card suit with 2 honors, and you are playing NT it is OK to lead the suit if there is no better lead.|
PG| ***** 169 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I would normally lead a heart, but with Ax I don't think that will work out well. So I am leading a diamond which could also not work out but it might.|

1) South (that's us) should know they don't have the points for game. 21 points? Really? |
PG| ***** 217 ***** |


NT|^B@2
2) South (again, that's us) didn't have a Diamond stopper and should never have bid No-trumps without one. |
PG| ***** 218 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Let's look at the hand as a whole. We have five tricks off the top and see we need to bring all the Clubs home, plus find another trick somewhere. |
PG| ***** 219 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The Diamond lead turns out to be a blessing. Thanks to Pard's dummy, the Diamonds will now provide the ninth trick. |
PG| ***** 220 ***** |


NT|^B@2
At trick 2, West changes his plan and leads what his partner bid, Hearts. We hold up, and at trick 5 go after the Diamonds to set up our ninth trick. |
PG| ***** 221 ***** |


NT|^B@2
West sees no reason to hold up. He takes the trick and switches to a Spade, in a vain effort to find winners.|
PG| ***** 222 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Now we need to find the @CQ. We know East (our Success Count) has four Hearts and four Spades. He showed out of Diamonds on the second Diamond trick, so he's gotta have four Clubs. We know how to play the suit and make our contract, losing only two Diamonds and two Hearts. |
PG| ***** 223 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So there you have it. An absolutely horrible contract, made, giving the "sinner" a top board. And you beginners wonder why the Big Dogs grumble? |
PG| ***** 224 ***** |


NT|^B@2
I find it very difficult to scold you for a top board and winning line of play. But... next time you try it, it will blow up in your face. Maybe.|

^B@2^*BDavid Bird: ^*N|cp||at|The correct line is to lead low towards the @SQ J 5 4 2, hoping to find East with the @SK. There are two other ways of playing this spade combination, both of which are inferior to the line just described. Can you think of them?|
PG| ***** 236 ***** |


NT|^B@2
(1) The first is to cross to the South hand and to lead the @SQ. This will cost the contract when East holds four trumps to the king (something like @SK 10 9 7). The @SQ will lose to East's @SK and he will score a second trump with his remaining @S10 9 7.|
PG| ***** 237 ***** |


NT|^B@2
(2) The second inferior line is to cash the @SA on the first round. This would succeed (luckily) if West held a singleton ?K. It would fail in the more likely case that West held any other singleton (@S10, @S9, @S8 or @S7).|
