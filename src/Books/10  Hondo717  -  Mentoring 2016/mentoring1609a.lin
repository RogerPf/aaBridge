^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|I will play Puppet Stayman responses. Playing Puppet Stayman over 2NT openers and 2NT rebids after 2@C opener is a good idea. It allows you to find both 5-3 and 4-4 fits in the majors.  I am not suggesting you play it, but would like to make everyone aware of how it works.|
PG| ***** 1 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Basically, here, if I bid 3@H or 3@S that shows a 5 card suit. If I bid 3@D that shows 1 or 2 4-card majors. And if I bid 3NT (which is what I am going to bid), that denies any 4+ major suits.|
PG| ***** 2 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If I bid 3@D, then the 3@C bidder bids the major he does not have. For example, if I bid 3@D (showing a 4 card major), Ben would bid 3@H to show he had spades. So if he bids 3@H and my 4 card major were spades, I would then be declarer in spades.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|It is not obvious, but Margaret should think about playing the @H8 rather than the @HK, assuming the lead is 4th best. Margaret can figure out I have 2 hearts in my hand. Granted I could have 10x and they could have the first 4 heart tricks--but not likely.|
PG| ***** 6 ***** |


NT|^B@2
On the other hand, if I have @HAQ (as I do) she gives me an extra heart trick. That is why I said not obvious but you can see the thinking.|
PG| ***** 7 ***** |


NT|^B@2
You always play the lowest of equal cards as 3rd hand--8 in this case. Now Faye can figure out she has the 9 because if I had the 9, I would have won the trick with the 9. That is why proper defensive carding is crucial if you want to defend as well as you can.|

Note that the @SJ being doubleton does not help on this hand because I don't have the entries to the board to cash a 4th spade even if the @SJ is doubleton.|

NT|^B@2
I should not I play clubs (even though that is my longest suit) because they will set up hearts before I can set up clubs. I could lose 2 or 3 hearts and 2 or 3 clubs if I play clubs. Plus I don't have the entries to lead a low club from dummy. I have to hope either spades or diamonds behave.|

On this hand, in match points I would take the risk. If East made the expert play of the @SJ holding @SJ9, then I congratulate her on her excellent play. (I am saying if East played the @SJ when East started with @SJ9x, that would have been a tricky but great play--not in this case.)|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|There is no clear cut way to bid these hands. The East/West bidding was very conservative but not completely unreasonable.

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|West could also bid 2@H over the 2@D bid. East would then raise to 3@H and East would bid 4@H. That to me is the best way to bid this hand. Let us illustrate that bidding next.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Redouble is an interesting bid Faye. There is a conventional meaning that many experts play. It shows Ax or Kx in spades. Since I am not an opening hand, there is no need to tell me if you have 10 points. The main thing you want to tell me is if you have spade support. And once I preempt, on almost every hand if we get the contract it will be in spades. So telling partner about your spades is your priority.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Even if you play 1430, you should not play 1430 when clubs are trump. As this hand is a good illustration because Ben doesn't want to bid 6 if East has 0 key cards. Personally, I play 0314 always, but even if you play 1430, you must play 0314 when clubs are trump just to take care of this case.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|One comment on the auction. While it is true that if partner makes a takeout double of a 1 level bid, and there is a redouble responder to the takeout double can (and should) bid even with 0 points if they have a suit of their own.|
PG| ***** 77 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Because if someone opens at the 1-level, followed by a double and redouble. That means the responder to the doubler can't by definition have much of anything. |
PG| ***** 78 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Two opening hands plus 10+ for the redouble doesn't leave a lot for the 4th hand. However, that is not true on this auction because South has preempted, not shown an opening hand and the redouble does not especially promise 10 points. So East's strength is unknown.|
PG| ***** 79 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Personally, I would have passed the redouble, but it worked out much better that Margaret bid. Otherwise, I am not sure what East should do. Probably bid 3@S to show a strong hand over 2@S redoubled and then they still end up in 5@C.|
PG| ***** 80 ***** |


NT|^B@2
But remember that the conventions after a takeout double of a preempt are not the same as the conventions after a takeout double of a 1-level opener. So both redouble and bidding after a redouble do not mean the same thing after a takeout double of a preempt. |
PG| ***** 81 ***** |


NT|^B@2
Regardless, this is a very unusual auction. At most tables it would not go redouble and then Margaret has an obvious 3@C bid.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Systems on here. If you play transfers after interference of a 1NT opener, you play the same thing when there is a 1NT overcall.

NT||NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In general, leading Ace from A doubleton is still a high risk lead. It could easily set up a suit or at least give a trick away. However, the risk is lowered since you have a sure trump trick. That means if partner has the @HK or an outside A, you will get a ruff. |
PG| ***** 130 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So with this hand, the @HA has merit as a lead. However, without a sure trump trick, it is a much more risky lead. Personally, without the @SA I would lead a diamond rather than the @HA.|

First of all, why not draw a round of trump first. And 2nd, this is what I call a "practice" finesse. Playing the @CQ can never gain a trick if EW defend correctly. However, playing a low club to the @CA and then a low club back will gain a trick if North has the @CK.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|In answer to a question by a Kib, when you open, you use Bergen Starting points which means HCP, length points, quality suit points, deductions for dubious shortness, and adjust 3 for quacks. You don't count shortness until you find a fit because shortness is not good until you know you are trumping something.|
PG| ***** 178 ***** |

The North hand is worth 23 starting points--21 HCP, 2 length points, 1 quality suit point, deduct 1 for @HKJ doubleton.|

PC|h2hqh6|NT|^B@2
There are two good reasons not to play dummy's @HK on the first trick. |
PG| ***** 231 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The first reason is that East may hold the @HA. Suppose you play the @HK from dummy on the first trick and East began with @HA 10. He will win with the @HA and return the @H10. The defenders will score the first five tricks in Hearts!|
PG| ***** 232 ***** |


NT|^B@2
The second reason is that playing the @HK may cost you the contract even when West holds the @HA. The @HK will win in that case but if a subsequent Diamond finesse fails, East may be able to return a Heart. When West started with something like @HA J x x x, you will then lose four Hearts and the @DK.|
PG| ***** 233 ***** |


 
PC|sq|
PG| ***** 234 ***** |


NT|^B@2
East holds @HQ 10, in fact, but he sees that it will not help the defense for him to return a Heart. You have a Heart stopper in dummy and West will not have an entry to enjoy the long cards in the suit. East tries his luck in Spades instead.|
