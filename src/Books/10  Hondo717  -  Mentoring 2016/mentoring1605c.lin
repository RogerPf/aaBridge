^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|That is the best EW can do. Now let's discuss Jordy's comment - double by West and bidding NT. Jordy is right in the following instance.|
PG| ***** 29 ***** |


NT|^B@2
If the auction goes something like 1@C-dbl-P-1@H-P-1NT, the 1NT is also a "double and correct" because a direct 1NT overcall shows 15-18, an immediate double and correct to 1NT shows a stronger hand, around 19-21.|
PG| ***** 30 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So had Judy doubled in direct seat and then corrected to NT, that would show her hand and the same thing applies here.|
PG| ***** 31 ***** |


NT|^B@2
So Jordy is right. a double followed by 2NT would show 19-21 which is what Judy had. Kia, with his 3 points and 5 diamonds should then probably correct to 3@D and that's where they end up anyway.|
PG| ***** 32 ***** |


NT|^B@2
In the other "double and correct to NT" auction you need to be worried about (and does come up fairly frequently) is when 1NT is in balancing position. If it goes, for example, 1@C-P-P-1NT, 1NT is a balancing NT showing around 11-14. Therefore, if the auction starts 1@C-P-P-dbl-P-1@H-P-1NT, that is still a double and correct to NT. On the other hand, because 1NT in balancing seat is 11-14, a double and correct to 1NT in balancing seat shows 15-18.|
PG| ***** 33 ***** |


NT|^B@2
dirtysox88: But with 2 bidding opps, pard rates to have nothing.|
PG| ***** 34 ***** |


cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|You are correct. West should know Kia can't have much. Because kadu opened and I responded, we rate to have 20 points. Maybe 18 or 19 if we both stretched.|
PG| ***** 35 ***** |


NT|^B@2 
Therefore West, with 20 points, combined with our 20 or so, knows that East can't have much maybe 2 or 3 points at best. So 3@D is probably the better call rather than double and 2NT |

PG| ***** 57 ***** |


NT|^B@2
As to why do I like 2@D better than pass of 1NT?|
PG| ***** 58 ***** |


AT| Because that tends to show a 6-card suit. So if we decide to come in, if Judy has 3 diamonds she would be comfortable competing to 3@D. But without the 2@D bid it would be harder for Judy to compete. On this hand, since Judy has a singleton diamond, it is not relevant. but on other hands it would be.|

^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|4@S is another "reasonable" (:)) bid. With such nice spades and a heart void it will often work out. The only down side is Kia's unfavorable vul (he is we are not). At any other vul it is pretty clear cut. Here I would do it, but the risk is higher. Let's see how it works out.|

NT||AT|
^B@2^*BMM: ^*NPlease, next, read the explanation by Howard if you were confused as How 2@S instead of 3@S became control bid in spades |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=controlbids^*N|CP||AT|. I assume it is one of the many fine prints I did not learn about this enchanted card game. Honest learning to play Ukulele is easier and more fun.|
PG| ***** 98 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Here is why I think there might be some confusion. If someone makes a Bergen Limit Raise (e.g 1@H-P-3@C), that is not game forcing. Any bids below 3@H (in this case obviously only 3@D) are game tries, not slam tries. Any bids above 3@H (which, by definition force the bidding to at least 4@H) are slam tries and control bids. |
PG| ***** 99 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|So if it goes 1@H-P-3@C-P-3@S, that establishes a game force, and is a control bid in spades looking for slam. But if it goes 1@H-P-3@C-P-3@D, that is a game try (the partnership is not yet committed to play 4@H), not a control bid.|
PG| ***** 100 ***** |


NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|However, on Board 4, the 2@C bid already established the game force. And the 2@H rebid by responder showed 3-card heart support. So the partnership is already committed to at least 4@H and may want to bid slam. Therefore all new suits below 4@H are control bids looking for slam.|

mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|NT||cp|8|AT|
^B@2^*Bhondo717: ^*N|cp||at|Although 4NT is correct, I will teach you a slightly better way to do RKCB when hearts are trump. It is called "kickback" |CP|1|AT|^*Hwww.bridgesights.com/hondobridge/hondoviewer/hondoviewer.php?sf=kickback^*N|CP||AT|.

^B@2^*BBarry Rigal: ^*N|cp||at|When East opens 1@S, there is no remotely sensible bid that South can make. The choices, such as they are, are to double, which of course is take-out, promising short Spades, or to overcall 1NT to show a balanced hand of 15(+)-18 points. Both of these bids are gross misdescriptions, and it is much more sensible to pass, and hope to get a chance to bid later on.|
PG| ***** 225 ***** |


NT|^b@2
That chance arises when North makes a balancing bid of 2@D; now South knows that 3NT must be a sensible enough spot, so he bids it directly, to end the auction. |
PG| ***** 226 ***** |


NT|^b@2
West has no reason not to lead his partner's suit against 3NT, and South must take his @SA or @SQ at the first trick for fear of a Heart shift, and should plan ahead carefully.|
PG| ***** 227 ***** |


NT|^b@2
He has eight sure winners (two Spades, one Heart, three Diamonds and two Clubs); the major suits are unpromising, but the Diamonds offer opportunities for extra tricks.|
PG| ***** 228 ***** |


NT|^b@2
However there is no hurry to play on Diamonds; if the suit does not split, there will be no entries to reach any extra winners established. It is far better to concentrate initially on those unpromising looking Clubs. |
PG| ***** 229 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Play Ace, King and a third Club, hoping that the fourth round of Clubs will be established; if not, you fall back on the Diamonds. As it is, when Clubs behave, you have your ninth trick. |
PG| ***** 230 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Note that if you play on Diamonds first, the Clubs become irrelevant, since there is no entry to the suit. Remember to plan the play from the very start; here the Diamonds look enticing, but it is the lowly Clubs that produce the game going trick.|

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|This board is about the finesse, a common but very important play in bridge. Here we are looking at deals where you don't know how the opponents' cards are arranged – you just have to hope that they lie in a certain way. That's in the nature of a finesse.|
PG| ***** 234 ***** |


NT|^b@2
We'll start with a definition. 

Tenace: Two cards of the same suit of which one ranks two degrees lower than the other. |
PG| ***** 235 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Confused? How about this? Two almost-touching cards with a space between them. All of the following suit combinations are tenaces:

 @SA Q, @HK J, @DQ 10, @CJ 9 |
PG| ***** 236 ***** |


NT|^b@2
The word comes from the Spanish tenaza, meaning "tongs" or "pincers" and tenaces are at the center of nearly all finesse plays. Basic finesse technique says that you do not lead away from tenaces, you lead up towards them.|

With six on top you need to find three more tricks. They aren't coming from Spades, Hearts or Clubs. That leaves you with Diamonds (a blinding glimpse of the obvious).

^B@2^*BMarti Ronemus: ^*N|cp||at|Bidding. 

After two Passes we open 1NT with our 4-3-3-3 hand containing 15 points. Partner has an easy raise to 3NT. 

Auctions don't come much simpler than this. |
PG| ***** 266 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Play: 
West leads the @S2 against 3NT, suggesting the lowest card from a four-card suit.|
PG| ***** 267 ***** |


NT|^b@2
[Note: After a 1NT – 3NT auction, if we can lead a major as a defender, it is usually right to do so. Declarer and dummy are unlikely to have an eight-card major-suit fit. Given a choice, therefore, between a major suit and a minor suit – lead the major]. |
PG| ***** 268 ***** |


NT|^b@2
Back to the show. We realize we're likely to lose the first four Spade tricks, which means we have to take the rest. We have no wriggle room at all. Our Count and Plan tells us that we start out with two Heart winners, one Diamond winner and three Club winners. In order to take all the rest of the tricks, we simply have to find the @DK with West. We will lead from the closed hand up towards the Diamond tenace on table. |
PG| ***** 269 ***** |


NT|^b@2
After cashing four Spades West gets off lead with the @HJ (nothing else is any better for his side – or ours).  We take that in hand with the King and play a Diamond, through West, playing the @D10 from dummy. This is the crucial point of the deal and is a straight 50-50 shot. If West has the @DK the @D10 must hold – if East has it we are doomed. |
PG| ***** 270 ***** |


NT|^b@2
When East plays a low Diamond to this trick, we know luck is on our side and we've got the rest of the tricks. Even a 4-1 Diamond split can't hurt us. We re-enter our hand with a Club, play up to the remaining @DA Q J, and play just high enough to beat West's card. |
PG| ***** 271 ***** |


NT|^b@2
As Diamonds are 3-2 we cash the @DA to drop the @DK and cash the last winning Diamond. Had they been 4-1 we'd have had to return to hand to take a third finesse in the suit. |
PG| ***** 272 ***** |


NT|^b@2
After that all we have to do is tidy up the room by cashing out our winners. We make two Hearts, four Diamonds and three Clubs for a total of nine in all. |
